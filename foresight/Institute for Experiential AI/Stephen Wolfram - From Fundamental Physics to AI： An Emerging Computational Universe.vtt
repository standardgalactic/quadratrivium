00:00.000 --> 00:08.840
So, welcome everybody, I have a pleasure to introduce Stephen Warfram, I know him many,

00:08.840 --> 00:14.600
many years because I was involved at some point in a different computer algebra system,

00:14.600 --> 00:22.180
you know he's the creator of Mathematica, he's the founder and CEO of Warfram Research,

00:22.180 --> 00:28.080
he also created this semantic search engine Warfram Alpha that you may be well aware of

00:28.080 --> 00:34.240
and now he's using language models, he's author of many books like A New Kind of Sciences

00:34.240 --> 00:41.680
and a very recent book on everything about physics and we are very happy that he accepted

00:41.680 --> 00:51.600
to come today to do the last distinguished lecture of the semester.

00:51.600 --> 00:58.360
So all right, let's talk about, so as far as I'm concerned the kind of the big idea

00:58.360 --> 01:06.000
that is kind of a defining idea probably of our century is this idea of computation and

01:06.000 --> 01:13.120
I kind of view it as being part of a long sequence of efforts that kind of span the

01:13.120 --> 01:18.560
history of our species I suppose in trying to formalize things.

01:18.560 --> 01:23.840
So you know the probably the first step in that was the creation of human language and

01:23.840 --> 01:29.180
the idea that one could instead of just sort of pointing at different rocks and so on,

01:29.180 --> 01:34.520
one could have a kind of symbolic term rock that represents the general category of things

01:34.520 --> 01:35.520
that are rocks.

01:35.520 --> 01:41.800
That was kind of a big step in being able to explain, in being able to abstract things

01:41.800 --> 01:46.880
from the world as it is to something that we can describe in a formal way and kind of

01:46.880 --> 01:52.440
I would say the next another big step in that was the creation of logic, the idea that

01:52.440 --> 01:57.280
one could take a collection of sentences that had the particular forms of particular forms

01:57.280 --> 02:04.280
and say there's something that we can abstract from all these sentences that is a representation

02:04.280 --> 02:10.440
of something that is formal that we can deduce from these sentences and it's kind of interesting

02:10.440 --> 02:15.640
that when we look at the chat GPs of this world and people are sort of amazed oh wow

02:15.680 --> 02:22.680
it manages to do logic well it's been trained from a you know trillion words of stuff that

02:23.320 --> 02:29.840
we humans have put out there on the web and that contains the same kind of forms of speech

02:29.840 --> 02:35.200
that you know Aristotle and folks like that used to originally construct logic it's able

02:35.200 --> 02:41.720
it's one is abstracting from the specifics of language to something that is a more formal

02:41.720 --> 02:44.360
representation of what's going on.

02:44.400 --> 02:49.720
I suppose in the kind of long arc of history the next big thing that's sort of an example

02:49.720 --> 02:56.200
of formalization of things in the world is mathematics that's another kind of way of

02:56.200 --> 03:02.960
formalizing what happens in the world describing things in terms of numbers and algebra and

03:02.960 --> 03:09.960
those sorts of things. And mathematics when it comes to science kind of the last 300 years

03:10.960 --> 03:17.960
sort of mathematics had been the kind of dominant form of formalization used in science

03:17.960 --> 03:22.640
logic was not particularly successful for as a formalization for science mathematics is

03:22.640 --> 03:29.640
sort of the winning one and that's something that has had continued until quite recently.

03:30.560 --> 03:35.520
The big thing that is sort of new last hundred years is this idea of computation the idea

03:35.560 --> 03:41.560
that there you can what is computation as far as I'm concerned it's you specify sort

03:41.560 --> 03:47.560
of precise rules and then you understand their consequences. In mathematics there are particular

03:47.560 --> 03:53.280
kinds of rules that are represented by I don't know algebra and integrals and calculus and

03:53.280 --> 03:58.080
things like that. There are particular kinds of rules that we study in mathematics computation

03:58.080 --> 04:03.440
is about the most general case of studying sort of given rules what are their consequences

04:03.440 --> 04:09.280
and by the way there's sort of a difference in the way that a particular time is handled

04:09.280 --> 04:13.880
when we think about computation as compared to when we think about for example mathematics

04:13.880 --> 04:18.360
in mathematics we might have some equation that has time as a parameter but we kind of

04:18.360 --> 04:22.160
expect we're going to get an answer where we get some formula where time appears in

04:22.160 --> 04:27.400
the formula but we can set that time to be any value we want. When we think about computation

04:27.400 --> 04:32.840
we're thinking about we're given these rules and now we're going to run these rules and

04:33.040 --> 04:38.480
we're going to see what happens we don't get to say oh I'm going to sort of set the value

04:38.480 --> 04:42.080
of time to be this we have to just run the rules and see what happens. Maybe I should

04:42.080 --> 04:49.080
explain some things that this is from the 1980s actually the kind of a big effort of

04:53.080 --> 05:00.080
the question that this I've been talking about kind of computation as a way of thinking

05:03.840 --> 05:09.720
kind of formalizing what happens in the world so one of the things I got interested in back

05:09.720 --> 05:15.800
at the beginning of the 1980s actually was if one is going to make models of nature what

05:15.800 --> 05:20.400
raw material one might one use to do that and kind of the traditional view had been

05:20.400 --> 05:24.960
used mathematical equations and so on my interest was to kind of generalize that and to see

05:24.960 --> 05:30.560
what happens if you use not equations but programs to represent things in the world

05:30.640 --> 05:36.200
and I have to say it's kind of a spoiler for the path of history but in the last 25 years

05:36.200 --> 05:42.040
or so there's been after 300 years of complete dominance of kind of mathematical equations

05:42.040 --> 05:46.880
as ways to model the world computation has become and programs and so on have kind of

05:46.880 --> 05:53.880
become the when new models are created that's almost always what new models get made with

05:53.880 --> 06:00.880
so but the question that I got interested in years ago is when you look at just simple

06:01.160 --> 06:08.160
if you just ask what what kinds of programs might nature use to do the things that it

06:08.200 --> 06:15.200
does and a particular category of such programs that I found convenient to look at are things

06:15.920 --> 06:23.680
that get called cellular automata this is an example of them it's just a line of cells

06:23.680 --> 06:29.560
each one is either black or white and in a series of steps you set the new color of

06:29.560 --> 06:34.000
the cell to be determined by rule that depends on the previous color of that cell and the

06:34.000 --> 06:41.000
previous colors of its two neighbors so if we take that we just say run run that let's

06:41.000 --> 06:48.000
let's let's let's run that for a few steps here let's just show this with a mesh okay

06:51.120 --> 06:56.440
so this is this is using that rule and at every at every cell at every step we're just

06:56.440 --> 07:01.240
applying that rule to determine what the color of the next step cell will be so we have a

07:01.240 --> 07:06.000
very simple rule we get very simple behavior it's kind of like you kind of you might expect

07:06.000 --> 07:10.400
that's what's going to happen well let's let's change this rule a bit let's say we have

07:10.400 --> 07:16.000
something like this we can change it see what it does that's what it does then let's change

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
it again let's say we do this how we use that rule instead well now we get a slightly more

07:23.680 --> 07:28.400
complicated pattern if we keep it running a little bit longer we'll find that it makes

07:28.400 --> 07:34.480
a nice some kind of elaborate intricate but very nested structure and we might again say

07:34.480 --> 07:39.640
at this point oh you know if the rule is simple then even if the behavior is somehow intricate

07:39.640 --> 07:46.200
there will be some easy regularity to identify in that behavior okay so now you can ask the

07:46.200 --> 07:50.520
question if you're just sort of studying these things from a sort of science point of view

07:50.520 --> 07:54.600
you can ask the question well why don't I just do an experiment why don't I just point sort

07:54.600 --> 07:59.120
of a computational telescope out into this computational universe of possible programs

07:59.120 --> 08:04.760
just find out what's out there so we can try doing that and let's just make a table of

08:04.800 --> 08:15.800
these with any rule number here and let's do let's say the first 64 of these and this is the result

08:15.800 --> 08:21.960
we get so much of the time so ever every one of these pictures is a different rule that we're

08:21.960 --> 08:27.160
using a much of the time you see what happens is really pretty simple maybe there's stripes from

08:27.160 --> 08:32.280
alternating stripes but there's some fairly simple structure that's produced and here are some nice

08:32.320 --> 08:39.400
nested patterns and then this is my all-time favorite science discovery here's rule 30 in that

08:39.400 --> 08:44.040
numbering scheme it does something a bit different let's take a look at that in a bit more detail

08:44.040 --> 08:50.480
let's say let's look at the rule for it here it is and let's look at what it actually does and

08:50.480 --> 08:55.840
that's the result so what's really remarkable about this is the rule is simple starts off

08:55.840 --> 09:01.360
from just one black cell yet the behavior you get when you actually run this rule is something

09:01.440 --> 09:06.320
complicated in fact if you look at the center column of cells here for all practical purposes

09:06.320 --> 09:14.320
they seem completely random and this is this is kind of a big surprise to one's intuition because

09:14.320 --> 09:18.400
this idea that to make something complicated you have to go lots of effort that's what we kind of

09:18.400 --> 09:23.920
learn intuitively from doing engineering if you want to make a complicated thing you have to go to

09:23.920 --> 09:28.400
a lot of effort to build up this whole structure that's going to make that complicated thing but

09:28.400 --> 09:33.600
here we've got something where in a sense effortlessly from this very simple rule we're making a

09:33.600 --> 09:39.720
very complicated thing well back in the 1980s what I was excited about was what that means for

09:39.720 --> 09:48.120
understanding what happens in nature what happens in in in kind of the understanding how sort of

09:48.120 --> 09:53.880
complexity arises in systems in nature and realizing that this kind of phenomenon that we see in the

09:53.880 --> 09:59.680
computational universe seems to be the secret that nature has that lets it makes so many complicated

09:59.680 --> 10:04.200
things that in fact out in the computational universe of possible programs that should pretty

10:04.200 --> 10:10.680
common to find that even very simple rules can generate what appears to us to be very complicated

10:10.680 --> 10:16.200
behavior well maybe it's worthwhile to understand kind of what how we can understand this phenomenon

10:16.200 --> 10:21.040
that very simple rules can produce very complicated behavior what's sort of going on what are the

10:21.040 --> 10:28.840
broader scientific implications of that and the I suppose one of the one of the big the underlying

10:28.840 --> 10:34.680
principle that I kind of came up with in the 1990s now is this thing I call the principle of

10:34.680 --> 10:41.120
computational equivalence so here's how this works we think about what what is this thing doing we

10:41.120 --> 10:45.600
can think of it as doing a computation it's been given some input it's been given a rule it runs

10:45.720 --> 10:51.880
that that that rule with that input it generates some output it's it's a computation like a computer

10:51.880 --> 10:58.320
might run a computation the question is how sophisticated is that computation is that

10:58.320 --> 11:03.920
computation one that is somehow quite straightforward we could just jump ahead and we could do a

11:03.920 --> 11:10.280
better computation figure out the answer or is it the case that this computation is is is a

11:10.280 --> 11:14.840
sophisticated one so the big thing that was discovered about a hundred years ago now is this

11:14.920 --> 11:19.920
idea of universal computation the idea that there exist systems like Turing machines and so on

11:19.920 --> 11:26.000
that have the property that you can just have a fixed piece of hardware so to speak a fixed rule

11:26.000 --> 11:31.680
and yet by changing the initial conditions for the system you can make that system behave like any

11:31.680 --> 11:36.040
other computational system and that's sort of an important idea because it's the idea that makes

11:36.040 --> 11:42.520
software possible it's kind of the idea that drove essentially modern technology as it is but that

11:42.560 --> 11:50.440
idea is says there exists a system that you can build it's maybe it's a microprocessor with a

11:50.440 --> 11:55.200
billion transistors on it that is capable of universal computation what the principle of

11:55.200 --> 12:00.080
computational equivalence says is something much more extreme than that it says whenever you look

12:00.080 --> 12:04.280
at these systems in the computational universe when they're not doing things that are in a sense

12:04.280 --> 12:10.920
obviously trivial then they will tend to be doing things which are as sophisticated computations as

12:10.920 --> 12:17.880
anything can do so it's kind of saying that that something like this system here should be capable

12:17.880 --> 12:23.120
of for example universal computation but more to the point it's the computation you're seeing here

12:23.120 --> 12:28.160
is as sophisticated as the computation that any system can do so what are the consequences of

12:28.160 --> 12:33.560
this well one consequence is if we're trying to predict what this system does then we're doing

12:33.560 --> 12:40.400
that by doing a computation so if we expect that we can sort of jump ahead and say this system

12:40.400 --> 12:44.760
after a billion steps is going to do this what we have to believe is that the computation we can

12:44.760 --> 12:49.720
do is somehow more sophisticated than the computation the system can do so that we can kind of do

12:49.720 --> 12:54.000
that jumping ahead and seeing what the answer is going to be but the principle of computational

12:54.000 --> 12:58.280
equivalence says you're not going to be able to do that it says that the computation you get to do

12:58.280 --> 13:04.040
with your brain your computer your mathematics whatever else is just the same sophistication as

13:04.040 --> 13:09.120
the computation that this little system can do so you can't expect to be able to jump ahead like

13:09.200 --> 13:14.160
that and that leads to this phenomenon I call computational irreducibility which is this idea

13:14.160 --> 13:19.920
that there are things that happen computations that happen which are irreducible in the sense

13:19.920 --> 13:24.240
that to know what's going to get what consequences they're going to have you basically just have

13:24.240 --> 13:29.440
to run that computation and see what happens you can't expect to jump ahead and figure out the

13:29.440 --> 13:35.360
answer with with less steps than actually running essentially with less steps than actually running

13:35.360 --> 13:39.680
the system so here's an example let me show you an example of another one where it's kind of

13:39.680 --> 13:46.320
interesting to see what happens here let's say rule 110 so this one actually happens to grow

13:46.320 --> 13:54.000
only on one side but you see it makes this little structure let's run it for a thousand steps let's say

13:54.560 --> 13:59.040
and the question will be we have that little structure there is that structure going to die out

13:59.040 --> 14:03.680
or is that structure going to keep going forever well if we said if there wasn't computational

14:03.680 --> 14:10.160
irreducibility we could say well we expect there's just some some sophisticated formula we can make

14:10.160 --> 14:14.400
that can jump ahead and say that's what's going to happen in the end to this but with computational

14:14.400 --> 14:19.680
irreducibility the only way we can work out what's going to happen is essentially to follow the steps

14:19.680 --> 14:25.360
and see what happens and if we don't know how many steps we have to follow it's going to be in general

14:25.360 --> 14:29.600
a question which is sort of undecidable to us what's going to happen in the end well let's see

14:29.840 --> 14:34.240
you can run it I think there's three thousand steps enough yeah three thousand steps was enough

14:34.240 --> 14:39.840
we can if you can just about see it you'll see that it pretty much died out maybe it's still got some

14:39.840 --> 14:45.520
possible life to it but what's interesting is that we can't predict that without essentially running

14:45.520 --> 14:51.600
the rule and just seeing what happens so okay so there's so we have that we've discovered this

14:51.600 --> 14:56.960
phenomenon that even very simple rules in the computational universe can produce very complicated

14:57.040 --> 15:04.960
behavior can produce behavior that is uh is it turns out to often be similar to the kinds of

15:04.960 --> 15:10.080
behavior we see in the in the natural world also has this feature that even though we might have

15:10.080 --> 15:14.880
thought you know the big thing about science is you can always jump ahead and predict things

15:14.880 --> 15:19.680
computational irreducibility shows us that's not true there's sort of a fundamental limitation

15:19.680 --> 15:23.360
it's kind of from within science we see there's sort of a fundamental limitation

15:23.360 --> 15:29.440
that prevents that from happening and makes it it so that we kind of just have to simulate things

15:29.440 --> 15:35.200
to see what's going to happen okay so one question you might ask is we found out the very simple

15:35.200 --> 15:40.480
rules can produce very complicated behavior uh how far does that go what kinds of things can

15:40.480 --> 15:46.480
that do can it make you know can it make brain like things can it make universe like things what

15:46.480 --> 15:50.000
can it make let's talk about the universe first because it's sort of the biggest thing we can

15:50.000 --> 15:57.760
talk about um and uh the um so the question is if we look at the physical world what what's

15:57.760 --> 16:03.120
underneath what's the underlying structure of how the physical world gets made could the physical

16:03.120 --> 16:11.040
world in fact be something which can be represented by some simple computational process and people

16:11.040 --> 16:14.880
have wondered you know what what's the sort of fundamental theory of physics for a long time

16:14.880 --> 16:19.600
and people have different views of that and there's been kind of a a bunch of well it's going waves

16:19.600 --> 16:24.320
of optimism and pessimism but about a hundred years ago a lot of progress was made in the invention

16:24.320 --> 16:29.040
of kind of the the core theories of modern physics which are basically statistical mechanics

16:29.040 --> 16:33.200
the theory of kind of what you know things like gases with lots of molecules how that works

16:33.200 --> 16:37.520
the second law of thermodynamics things like that that's one bucket the second bucket uh

16:37.520 --> 16:41.920
is general relativity the theory of gravity and the structure of spacetime and the third bucket

16:41.920 --> 16:47.280
is quantum mechanics and the theory of very small things so to speak so those are the sort of the

16:47.520 --> 16:53.840
um the main uh there was sort of a big big advance a hundred years ago or so now in those

16:53.840 --> 17:00.960
kinds of areas um the question is okay so what's for example what's underneath those things are

17:00.960 --> 17:06.000
those just sort of arbitrary wheel in features of the universe or are they derivable in some way

17:06.720 --> 17:13.200
so this kind of seeing things like rule 30 makes one think well maybe there might be some very

17:13.280 --> 17:21.760
simple rule that might be able to to explain what's going on well back in the 1990s I started

17:21.760 --> 17:27.600
thinking about this made quite a bit of progress actually but the time I suppose physics was in a

17:27.600 --> 17:33.120
very um high self-esteem state and it was like string theory is going to solve it you don't

17:33.120 --> 17:39.760
need anything else so I worked on other things which turned out to be rather productive and

17:39.840 --> 17:45.120
then about four years ago now came back to this question having figured out a lot of other things

17:45.120 --> 17:50.080
in the intervening years and having built this big stack of technology I mean in in the the kind

17:50.080 --> 17:54.800
of rough summary of my life is that I've kind of alternated between doing basic science and

17:54.800 --> 17:59.840
developing tools and technology and it's been a pretty pretty good journey I would say because

17:59.840 --> 18:05.200
you know you do basic science it shows you what is conceivable to build in technology you then

18:05.200 --> 18:10.800
build the technology that creates tools that let you do more basic science and I managed to

18:10.800 --> 18:16.400
iterate this about five times so far in my life and it's built a pretty big tower and from the

18:16.400 --> 18:21.920
top of that tower we can now see some pretty neat basic science that's been really exciting to me

18:21.920 --> 18:25.680
in the last few years and let me let me tell you a little bit about that and then I'm going to

18:25.680 --> 18:30.400
tell you a bit about sort of how that connects to the practical world of of kind of computational

18:30.400 --> 18:37.520
x for all x and we'll talk about AI and and whatever else we can we can fit in there all right so

18:37.520 --> 18:42.240
let's talk about the fundamental theory of physics and what's underneath the stuff that

18:42.960 --> 18:48.960
we experience in the world let's see I probably have a nice visual summary here which I can perhaps use

18:52.720 --> 18:58.480
so this is sort of a visual summary of our physics project and as is often the case in

18:58.480 --> 19:02.640
science the first thing you have to do to make progress is to realize what was wrong before

19:03.280 --> 19:08.720
and one thing that's been assumed the last couple of thousand years is that space is something

19:08.720 --> 19:13.600
continuous that you can just sort of space is just this thing where you can say I'm going to put

19:13.600 --> 19:17.360
something at this particular coordinate position in space I'm going to put it at some arbitrary

19:17.360 --> 19:23.840
position in space turns out that seems to be wrong that space is not a continuous thing space is

19:23.840 --> 19:29.600
made of something and a hundred years ago people thought this might be the case actually

19:29.600 --> 19:33.360
because a hundred years ago there was a big a little bit more than a hundred years ago so the

19:33.360 --> 19:38.640
big argument was is matter continuous or discrete are there discrete molecules or is matter a

19:38.640 --> 19:45.280
continuous kind of thing same question for light well it turned out round 1900 people realized no

19:45.280 --> 19:52.480
molecules really exist matter is discrete and turns out and light by 1905 and so people realized

19:52.480 --> 19:57.600
photons really exist light is also discrete so you know matters discrete light is discrete what

19:57.600 --> 20:03.360
about space at that time and actually I just recently I just lost a few days actually learned

20:03.360 --> 20:08.640
even another place where sort of most of the physicists so to speak back in the early part of

20:08.640 --> 20:13.200
the 20th century thought that space was discrete but they couldn't make it work in fact Einstein

20:13.200 --> 20:18.240
has a nice quote from 1916 that basically says in the end space will turn out to be discrete

20:18.240 --> 20:23.680
but we don't have the tools necessary to see how that works now a hundred years later

20:23.680 --> 20:29.520
turns out we do so the sort of the first first sort of starting point is the realization that

20:29.520 --> 20:36.320
space is discrete space is made of discrete atoms of space an atom of space has nothing

20:36.880 --> 20:41.360
there's nothing you can say about it other than it's this it's this idealized point this idealized

20:41.360 --> 20:46.080
element the only thing that one can say about it is that it exists and it's unique and distinct

20:46.080 --> 20:51.440
from other atoms of space and then what can you say about the atoms of space well all you can

20:51.440 --> 20:55.200
say is how they're related to each other you can kind of think of the friend network of the

20:55.200 --> 21:02.240
atoms of space so you're kind of saying what and that's all you know about these things there's

21:02.240 --> 21:06.320
not they're not placed in any kind of you know you're not saying it's in three dimensions and

21:06.320 --> 21:11.600
you're placing this particular atom here and so on all you know is there's this giant network

21:11.600 --> 21:16.960
that represents the relations between the atoms of space and it's convenient to technically it's

21:16.960 --> 21:23.120
convenient to think about it as a hypergraph and an ordinary graph you have two nodes of the graph

21:23.120 --> 21:27.440
and they're they're connected by an edge and a hypergraph you can have any number of nodes

21:27.440 --> 21:32.080
connected by a hyper edge so it's just technically convenient to think about it as a hypergraph

21:32.080 --> 21:38.560
so the structure of space is this hypergraph of atoms of space and basically everything in the

21:38.560 --> 21:44.400
universe is just part of this giant hypergraph so all the things that we experience the you know the

21:44.400 --> 21:50.400
the electrons the black holes whatever else they're all just features of this giant hypergraph it's

21:50.400 --> 21:54.400
kind of like when you if you think about something like water there's a bunch of molecules bouncing

21:54.400 --> 21:59.520
around but you can have things like eddies vortices in the water which are structures that have some

21:59.520 --> 22:03.920
persistence and it's those kinds of structures that are like the things that we experience like

22:03.920 --> 22:08.960
electrons and so on so okay so the the sort of underlying data structure of the universe is this

22:08.960 --> 22:13.600
giant hypergraph made of atoms of space and by the way it's a it's a feature of doing very

22:13.600 --> 22:18.560
foundational things that there are many equivalent versions of this statement you can talk about it

22:18.560 --> 22:23.200
in terms of higher category theory you can talk about it in different terms but I think the most

22:23.200 --> 22:30.000
concrete version is it's this giant network that is this hypergraph so then what that's sort of the

22:30.000 --> 22:34.960
structure of space the structure of what how does time work by the way one of the things that's sort

22:34.960 --> 22:40.560
of a wrong turn in the 100 years ago was this idea that space and time are the same kind of thing

22:40.560 --> 22:44.800
it was a kind of idea that was introduced sort of as a mathematical convenience and then it

22:44.800 --> 22:49.280
became a thing that everybody explained oh space time is you know space and time are all connected

22:49.280 --> 22:53.680
together like that I don't think it's true time is actually something very different from space it

22:53.680 --> 23:00.080
turns out that the features of relativity theory that connect space and time emerge from the kind

23:00.080 --> 23:05.120
of large-scale properties of the system but they're not the intrinsic way to think about it so what

23:05.120 --> 23:10.800
is time well time is this kind of process of computation just like in that rule 30 cellular

23:10.800 --> 23:16.320
automaton we've got the series of steps those represent the progress of time and computational

23:16.320 --> 23:21.520
irreducibility kind of tells us there's some kind of irreducible thing achieved by the passage of

23:21.520 --> 23:28.160
time and so it is in the system instead of it being updating these cells with neighbors and so on

23:28.160 --> 23:35.840
it's you say we've got this we've got this graph and we have these rules that just say whenever you

23:35.840 --> 23:40.000
see a little piece of graph that looks like this rewrite it to a piece of graph that looks like

23:40.000 --> 23:44.400
that and so you keep doing that over and over again and you build up more and more elaborate

23:44.400 --> 23:48.800
kinds of graphs you get all kinds of complicated structures like this and one question is when

23:48.800 --> 23:53.520
you do that enough times what is the what what you know when you have a graph that has 10 to

23:53.520 --> 23:57.520
the 100 nodes or something in it you've built up this way what is the structure of that graph

23:58.240 --> 24:01.440
well it's a similar question to asking the question if you have a bunch of molecules

24:01.440 --> 24:06.800
bouncing around and they each interact according to some force law and so on what is the large-scale

24:06.800 --> 24:10.800
behavior of a whole collection of molecules and the answer we know in that case is it's like fluid

24:10.800 --> 24:15.040
dynamics that's what happens in something like water you've got these discrete molecules bouncing

24:15.040 --> 24:21.200
around the emergent kind of behavior of the system follows the laws of fluid mechanics

24:21.200 --> 24:25.840
okay so what's the analogous thing here well it's pretty neat because it turns out the analogous

24:25.840 --> 24:31.520
thing here is the thing follows the Einstein equations which are the the the corresponding

24:31.520 --> 24:38.080
laws for the structure of spacetime and so you can then derive from this very simple underlying

24:38.080 --> 24:43.040
set of rules that are about the rewriting of networks the large-scale limits of that with a

24:43.040 --> 24:50.240
bunch of footnotes that are a complicated story you can derive the fact that you get the structure

24:50.240 --> 24:55.280
of spacetime that that we observe now actually one of the things that's tricky is this thing

24:55.280 --> 24:58.720
doesn't have any space in it at the beginning it doesn't even know that it's in three dimensions

24:58.720 --> 25:03.120
for instance dimension is something that's an emergent property of the system where you're

25:03.120 --> 25:07.440
basically saying if you start from a given node in this in this graph and you say what how many

25:07.440 --> 25:11.920
nodes do you get to by going a certain distance on the graph a certain number of steps in the

25:11.920 --> 25:17.600
in the graph let's say you get to some number of nodes and that number of nodes grows like r

25:17.600 --> 25:23.360
the distance to the power d then you can identify that d as the dimension the effective dimension

25:23.360 --> 25:27.920
of the space so one of the consequences of this model is that space won't be precisely three

25:27.920 --> 25:31.760
dimensional there'll actually be dimension fluctuations probably the the beginning of the

25:31.760 --> 25:36.080
universe will be infinite dimensional gradually the universe kind of cools down to being the

25:36.080 --> 25:41.200
three dimensions we observe today and they're probably dimension fluctuations left over from

25:41.200 --> 25:45.760
the other universe and an interesting kind of current sort of can we figure out how this

25:45.760 --> 25:50.560
works question is what actual experimental signatures there are from such a phenomenon

25:51.440 --> 25:57.440
but anyway so so by the way let me just show you um see if I can find this uh yeah let me let me

25:57.440 --> 26:04.080
just show you in this model um this is kind of the uh what the the a version of the beginning

26:04.080 --> 26:09.760
of the universe in this kind of model where so we're we're seeing here the progressive rewriting

26:09.760 --> 26:17.760
of uh kind of this network of atoms of space and uh this is the first very small amount of time

26:17.760 --> 26:23.520
in at least one branch of the beginning of the universe um you have to keep going a long way

26:23.520 --> 26:27.520
to get to our current universe and because of computational irreducibility that's not something

26:27.520 --> 26:37.120
I'm going to be able to do on my laptop however the um uh the thing that um you can set things

26:37.120 --> 26:42.240
up to kind of see what would it be like if you had a much bigger chunk of space and this is an

26:42.240 --> 26:49.760
example yes okay so this is much later in the history of the universe these are two little

26:49.760 --> 26:55.440
black holes and what you'll see here is the the uh that sort of the background here is the structure

26:55.440 --> 27:00.160
of space and space is kind of knitted together by all these little rewrites that are happening if

27:00.160 --> 27:06.240
it wasn't for all these rewrites space would fall apart the space the the fact that there is this

27:06.480 --> 27:11.680
thing we can think of as space that is kind of it has extent is a consequence of the of the

27:11.680 --> 27:15.360
progression through time of all these rewrites but anyway here are two little black holes and you

27:15.360 --> 27:20.880
can see what they do the space is is wiggling around a lot these two little black holes actually

27:20.880 --> 27:26.480
feel the force of gravity um that's just a consequence of these rewrites and then those

27:26.480 --> 27:32.960
black holes merge well that's something that we observe in uh that's gravitational wave detectors

27:32.960 --> 27:37.280
have observed the merger of black holes these are incredibly tiny black holes turns out very

27:37.280 --> 27:41.280
conveniently the behavior of a very tiny black hole is pretty much the same as the behavior of a

27:41.280 --> 27:46.400
very big black hole so we can actually start to see and when when these black holes merge and this

27:46.400 --> 27:51.520
little simulation here um turns out they emit gravitational radiation and we can start seeing

27:51.520 --> 27:55.840
the properties of their gravitational radiation and one of the current frontier questions is

27:55.840 --> 28:01.440
whether there are features of that gravitational radiation that reveal the discreteness of space

28:01.440 --> 28:05.120
and uh I think I think it's it's fairly promising that there are although

28:05.120 --> 28:09.520
whether the magnitude of the the things is such that we can detect it now

28:09.520 --> 28:13.760
versus a hundred years from now we don't know yet that yet but anyway that's kind of

28:13.760 --> 28:19.920
how the the structure of space works in in these these kinds of models another thing to to mention

28:20.320 --> 28:31.680
is uh another so I mentioned this um um the um the the question of um these sort of three big

28:31.680 --> 28:38.160
theories of of 20th century physics statistical mechanics general relativity and quantum mechanics

28:38.160 --> 28:41.840
so we've got what I've been describing is the derivation of general relativity people didn't

28:41.840 --> 28:46.080
think general relativity was something you could derive from something lower level it looks like

28:46.080 --> 28:51.360
it is so the another piece to this is quantum mechanics and sort of the big idea of quantum

28:51.360 --> 28:57.200
mechanics is in classical physics you imagine that definite things happen in the world in

28:57.200 --> 29:01.680
quantum mechanics the big idea is that you know you throw a ball and it doesn't just follow a

29:01.680 --> 29:06.560
single trajectory it follows many possible trajectories and you just get to figure out

29:06.560 --> 29:12.400
what the probability of different things happening is well in our models we actually have no choice

29:12.400 --> 29:17.440
but to have quantum mechanics because what happens is that I talked about the rewriting of these

29:17.440 --> 29:22.000
hypergraphs that represent the structure of the space and everything in it there are many possible

29:22.000 --> 29:26.480
ways these rewritings can happen and the results of that is that you get what we call a multiway

29:26.480 --> 29:31.280
graph that represents all the different possible paths of history there can be different rewritings

29:31.280 --> 29:36.400
that happen there can be that can cause these paths of history to branch they can merge and so on

29:36.400 --> 29:41.440
so kind of the the big thing that happens that you get these multiway graphs multiway graphs are

29:41.440 --> 29:46.240
something pretty interesting that that sort of related to nondeterministic computation but in

29:46.240 --> 29:51.280
nondeterministic computation you tend to just say we're going to pick the one winning branch

29:51.280 --> 29:55.840
in multiway computation you're interested in sort of all the possible things that can happen

29:55.840 --> 30:00.000
and so you know you can kind of think about lots of different kinds of problems in these

30:00.000 --> 30:05.360
terms you know you've got a game like tic-tac-toe or something there are many possible paths you can

30:05.360 --> 30:12.000
follow to in the in the doing of that game and you can kind of look at the complete graph that

30:12.000 --> 30:16.800
you get let's see if I can just pull up a picture of that so you know a typical kind of thing would

30:16.800 --> 30:25.120
be here we go it's kind of a multiway graph that just shows given that you're starting with a blank

30:25.120 --> 30:29.840
tic-tac-toe simplified tic-tac-toe board you get this kind of graph of all these possibilities

30:29.920 --> 30:32.960
you keep going somewhere here probably there's a picture of the actual

30:33.920 --> 30:39.520
game and and what it takes to win the game and so on but that that's an example of a multiway

30:39.520 --> 30:46.640
graph in that particular case for just a the game of tic-tac-toe but the the whole point is

30:46.640 --> 30:51.440
there is also a multiway graph for the whole structure of our universe and the fact that

30:51.440 --> 30:56.400
there are these different paths is is the reason that we get quantum mechanics since it's slightly

30:56.400 --> 31:01.600
more complicated story we have when you when you kind of take a slice across all those paths

31:01.600 --> 31:06.000
you form this kind of space we call it branch real space the space of quantum branches

31:06.000 --> 31:10.720
which is kind of its own kind of space and just as you can think about kind of motion

31:10.720 --> 31:14.000
and physical space you can also think about motion and branch real space

31:14.000 --> 31:19.920
just as you can think about observing physical space we we notice that in physical space well

31:19.920 --> 31:27.360
okay the the we we are at a scale much larger than the atoms of space and so we aggregate when we

31:27.360 --> 31:33.440
observe what physical space is like what we're observing is this this vast aggregation of atoms

31:33.440 --> 31:39.200
of space and that's why space seems to us continuous well something a bit similar happens in quantum

31:39.200 --> 31:45.040
mechanics what happens is that just as we are extended in physical space we are also extended

31:45.040 --> 31:50.640
in branch real space and so a rather strange thing it has to do with the fact that an observer

31:50.640 --> 31:56.560
like us that has that is part of this universe that's branching emerging and so on the question

31:56.560 --> 32:02.000
of quantum mechanics becomes how does a branching brain perceive a branching universe and turns

32:02.000 --> 32:07.760
out that when you untangle those things the answer is quantum mechanics so okay just to

32:07.760 --> 32:15.760
finish on this in this branch for a second the the thing so one of the one of the questions would

32:15.760 --> 32:20.880
be okay so we've got this model for physics and we can say there's an underlying rule which if we

32:20.880 --> 32:26.320
run it for long enough we'll make our universe so the next question is well why did we get that rule

32:26.320 --> 32:32.160
and not another rule and that's it's sort of a you know that's a kind of the the Copernican thing

32:32.160 --> 32:37.040
would be to think there can't be anything special about the rule we got we just have to have some

32:37.040 --> 32:42.880
sort of very arbitrary rule well the the thing that I wondered about this for a while and then

32:42.880 --> 32:49.680
we realized that actually here's what's going on the the structure I mentioned that given a

32:49.680 --> 32:54.240
particular rule you apply to no possible ways and that's what gives you quantum mechanics

32:54.240 --> 32:59.120
but why do you have just one particular rule what happens if you apply all possible rules

32:59.120 --> 33:04.480
and you make something which is the result of taking all possible computational rules

33:04.480 --> 33:09.040
and running them and you can see that different rules will produce different results but then

33:09.040 --> 33:13.600
those results might converge again because when you run different rules again they'll converge to

33:13.600 --> 33:19.440
the same results and so on you get this big complicated entangled mess that is the the result

33:19.440 --> 33:24.080
of running all possible computations so you it's kind of you make this thing which is the

33:24.080 --> 33:29.200
entangled limit of all possible computations it's the thing we call the rule ad and it's kind of the

33:29.200 --> 33:34.080
it's an encapsulated object that represents everything that is computationally possible

33:34.640 --> 33:38.560
and it's a it's a kind of an interesting object because it's a very it's a necessary object it's

33:38.560 --> 33:44.720
not an object that you say oh it happens to exist in this way in that way it's just given the idea

33:44.720 --> 33:50.160
of computation there is just a single object that is this rule ad that represents all possible

33:50.160 --> 33:55.440
the entangled limit of all possible computations okay so so what so how do you make how do you take

33:55.440 --> 34:04.240
that and understand sort of how we we perceive physics and things like this well the key thing

34:04.800 --> 34:09.680
is this realization that we are a certain kind of observer of this rule ad we are it's a little

34:09.680 --> 34:14.560
bit of a brain twisting kind of thing because we are embedded within this rule ad we are part

34:14.560 --> 34:21.920
of this rule ad and we are observing what happens in the rule ad and turns out that there are we

34:21.920 --> 34:26.480
might say well well what we observe to be happening in the rule ad depends on what we are like as

34:26.480 --> 34:31.520
observers so the question is do we how much do we have to know about what we're like as observers

34:31.520 --> 34:36.160
to conclude what about what we will perceive happens in the rule ad okay so it turns out

34:36.160 --> 34:41.760
there are two key assumptions about us as observers both of which are pretty uncontroversial one is

34:41.760 --> 34:47.840
that we are computationally bounded we we can only in our sort of finite minds we can only fit a

34:47.840 --> 34:53.040
certain amount of computational effort it's point one point two is we believe we are persistent in

34:53.040 --> 34:58.640
time even though at every moment in time we might be made of different atoms of space we believe

34:58.640 --> 35:04.480
that we have a single thread of experience that continues throughout time so those are two assumptions

35:04.480 --> 35:08.640
so it turns out this is sort of the big result of the last few years it turns out those two

35:08.640 --> 35:15.760
assumptions are sufficient to derive the three big theories of 20th century physics so given this

35:15.760 --> 35:21.200
idea of the rule ad if you say what does an observer with those characteristics perceive in this big

35:21.200 --> 35:26.720
messy rule ad of all possible computations it turns out that an observer with those characteristics

35:26.720 --> 35:32.080
necessarily perceives actually the second rule of thermodynamics general relativity and quantum

35:32.080 --> 35:38.080
mechanics that's kind of a very interesting kind of I suppose philosophical moment that these are

35:38.080 --> 35:42.400
things which seemed like they were just features of the universe that happen to be the way they are

35:42.400 --> 35:47.920
but it isn't true that there instead there is this kind of necessary formal structure

35:47.920 --> 35:53.680
which for observers like us if we were not like we are if we were some kind of alien observers

35:53.680 --> 35:59.200
with different characteristics we would perceive a different physics but given that we are observers

36:00.000 --> 36:04.400
of the kind that we are we necessarily perceive these features of the physical world

36:04.400 --> 36:11.200
so that's that's kind of a that's a that's a sort of a big deal in in in thinking about physics

36:11.200 --> 36:15.520
it also turns out to have implications about mathematics and the kind of nature of mathematics

36:15.520 --> 36:20.400
and so on can talk about those but let me let me talk about some more practical kinds of things so

36:20.640 --> 36:27.520
we we've kind of understood something about this idea of computation that ends up sort of going all

36:27.520 --> 36:32.160
the way down it gives us the machine code for the universe it seems and it tells us things about

36:32.160 --> 36:38.880
sort of the sort of the big picture of what's computationally possible well it's okay so here

36:38.880 --> 36:47.200
we are as just humans hanging out in this rule ad and and and the question is how do we access

36:47.280 --> 36:53.520
this kind of this the the how do we what can we access of computation and so then we have the kind

36:53.520 --> 36:59.600
of interesting situation we are humans who think about things in certain ways and what do we you

36:59.600 --> 37:06.160
know how can we make use of this kind of power of computation that sort of is the intrinsic thing

37:06.160 --> 37:11.440
that runs the universe and so on and and what you start realizing is that you need some kind of bridge

37:11.440 --> 37:16.640
between the way we think about things and the sort of ocean of computational possibilities

37:17.200 --> 37:22.320
much of what's out there in the computational universe is stuff that is completely incomprehensible

37:22.320 --> 37:26.960
to us it's stuff where we can run all these cellular automata they make all these patterns

37:26.960 --> 37:30.800
we say we don't really know what the significance of this is they're not really connected to anything

37:30.800 --> 37:37.840
we know about most of the computational universe is completely alien to us and so the the question

37:37.840 --> 37:43.840
really becomes sort of how do we characterize the parts of the computational universe that we humans

37:43.840 --> 37:48.640
can connect to his sort of perhaps an interesting experiment I can show you something here this

37:48.640 --> 37:58.800
is looking with genitive AI um just looking at um the uh yeah this is um this is looking at um

37:58.800 --> 38:04.800
sort of a very tiny slice of the rule ad that has been set up to be aligned with the way we humans

38:04.800 --> 38:10.080
think about things because it's been it's a genitive AI trained on a few billion images

38:10.080 --> 38:14.080
and so what we're asking is if we look out into that sort of space of possible

38:15.440 --> 38:20.080
possible things that we can think of as a tiny slice of the rule yard what's out there and so we

38:20.080 --> 38:26.800
we said okay let's let's make a we initially say we're going to look for a cat and a party hat

38:27.360 --> 38:35.520
and um somewhere at the beginning there was um was a part of um of this uh of the space that

38:35.600 --> 38:41.040
has a nice cat there the question is what else is out there in the space if you go away from the

38:41.040 --> 38:46.240
cat and the party hat you go out um and you're you're going out into sort of this space of

38:46.240 --> 38:50.640
computational possibilities and what you find is there's sort of a cat island where things are

38:50.640 --> 38:57.840
sort of identifiably cat like but then most of sort of this space consists of things that

38:57.840 --> 39:01.920
well there's some definite structure there but it's not clear what we humans would say about

39:01.920 --> 39:07.520
that structure we don't really have a a way of thinking about that we think about so we can kind

39:07.520 --> 39:13.760
of think about think about these sort of blobs of of possibility that are concepts of things we've

39:13.760 --> 39:19.920
given human names to we've given words to their concepts we know about and then there's this vast

39:19.920 --> 39:25.680
area of kind of inter concept space kind of analogous to interstellar space where it's something

39:25.680 --> 39:32.320
that we haven't you know we humans have not conceived we don't have a way to that we brought

39:32.320 --> 39:38.000
that into our kind of world and so you might ask well what fraction of space is inter concept space

39:38.000 --> 39:44.480
in this very simple example that's a very sort of optimistic case one part and ten to the six

39:44.480 --> 39:51.520
hundred of the space is space that we understand uh the rest of it is all inter concept space

39:51.520 --> 39:56.640
concepts that we humans have not yet reached so you can kind of think about the the progress of

39:56.640 --> 40:02.000
of our uh intellect and science and so on as being this kind of colonization of what we call

40:02.000 --> 40:08.320
rural space of kind of gradually expanding in the domain of what we consider what we have concepts

40:08.320 --> 40:15.040
to describe it's some uh kind of a okay to make a slightly bizarre comment but but one thing you

40:15.040 --> 40:19.680
might wonder about is okay in the future of science and everything maybe the future of

40:19.680 --> 40:24.480
science is we expand in in rural space and we we eventually expand so that we fill all of rural

40:24.480 --> 40:29.360
space it turns out one should be careful what one wishes for because one feature of that

40:29.360 --> 40:35.760
is that in in in a sense went by by the time you have a mind that is that big it is not a coherent

40:35.760 --> 40:41.680
mind anymore and for it to coherently exist it has to be something that is limited in rural

40:41.680 --> 40:46.880
space by the time it fills the whole rulliard in no meaningful sense does it coherently exist

40:46.880 --> 40:53.840
so in a sense when you when you if you expand too far uh you you you no longer can can describe

40:53.840 --> 41:01.680
yourself as as coherently existing so okay so so there's there's this um uh this is kind of what

41:01.680 --> 41:07.920
what it looks like out in this sort of human aligned uh inter concept space this is this is

41:07.920 --> 41:14.400
kind of what what it looks like just in sort of out in the rulliard looking at different possible

41:14.400 --> 41:20.160
behaviors these are just cellular automata um but we can say well when we look at these things

41:20.160 --> 41:25.360
what are these things how do we describe them are they things that are relevant to to us yet do we

41:25.360 --> 41:30.720
yet have words for these things and the answer is typically no we've we've explored only this tiny

41:30.720 --> 41:36.320
slice okay but so what can we do with the slice that we're exploring well the big thing that i've

41:36.320 --> 41:42.640
spent much of my life actually doing is trying to build kind of a a a thing that is a bridge between

41:42.640 --> 41:48.880
the way we think about things and what's computationally possible and the way that what we what we

41:48.880 --> 41:54.000
need to do is to take the things that we care about that we think about and formalize them so we

41:54.000 --> 41:59.200
represent them computationally so that we can make use of kind of the power that exists in this

41:59.200 --> 42:04.400
computational universe and so that has been the the big effort to build what we call wolfman language

42:05.120 --> 42:12.560
um and sort of the goal there is is to be able to represent sort of everything in the world

42:12.560 --> 42:17.600
in a computational kind of way so i mean if i take um uh well let's just let's just say you

42:17.600 --> 42:24.400
know i have um i don't know some uh let's let's say i make some graph uh we can we can represent

42:24.400 --> 42:30.000
some random graph as as a computational kind of thing we could say i don't know let's work out

42:30.720 --> 42:35.920
let's just do some computation on that and the um uh um

42:37.760 --> 42:42.560
well we could take um uh we could take some let's see if i can um take an image here

42:43.600 --> 42:52.560
ah what if i do that um let's see there we go well terrible image but um we could we could say

42:52.560 --> 42:59.680
something like um uh well let's just say something like edge detect that image um or we could say

43:00.000 --> 43:06.400
we want it to be a little bit more optimistic let's see um how about we do this how about we say

43:09.520 --> 43:11.040
let's do this um

43:13.760 --> 43:19.600
let's take that image and let's say we want to just say identify what's in that image but let's

43:19.600 --> 43:26.480
let's run it this way so we're running some neural net we can look at um uh we may have to load in

43:26.480 --> 43:33.200
oh what earth is that i have no idea what that is um it's the back it's the backdrop okay

43:36.560 --> 43:40.960
okay let's see well let's let's see what happens if we say what's the word definition of that thing

43:42.560 --> 43:52.960
ha okay the um but it's kind of interesting to um uh we can look here if we say uh well that that

43:52.960 --> 44:00.000
thing will just be some neural net that um uh we can look at it's all the all the all the nasty

44:00.000 --> 44:06.800
innards of it we could for example just say let's just take the first uh five levels of the neural

44:06.800 --> 44:16.800
net or something and apply that to this picture um and uh and then maybe we can say uh make images

44:16.800 --> 44:22.640
out of those okay so that's kind of the the uh inside the mind of the neural net um what it's

44:22.640 --> 44:28.080
thinking about maybe we can just say let's let's just do this let's say make a feature space plot

44:28.080 --> 44:33.440
of those let's see if we can not very exciting it just decided that there were two clumps of

44:33.440 --> 44:37.280
things that was thinking about one seemed like they're mostly white one seems like they're mostly

44:37.280 --> 44:43.840
black so it goes um but but anyway the kind of the concept here is to make a computational

44:43.840 --> 44:49.760
language that can formalize the things we like to think about in computational terms

44:49.760 --> 44:55.200
so that we can do things uh so that we can use sort of the power of computation to operate on

44:55.200 --> 45:00.560
those kinds of things so for example there's the part of the the story is just knowing a lot about

45:00.560 --> 45:05.440
the world so we might say you know that's there's a list of words in English maybe we can say let's

45:05.440 --> 45:11.760
just take the first letter of each word and let's make a word cloud of those first letters

45:12.320 --> 45:17.520
and um this will give us oops what did I just do word list oh that's not what I want to do I wanted

45:17.520 --> 45:23.520
to say take just the first letters there okay there we go and so that gives us for for English

45:23.520 --> 45:27.280
the uh the sort of word cloud of first letters maybe we can just for fun let's try doing

45:28.080 --> 45:32.160
Spanish for example I don't know whether anybody knows what the what what part of a dictionary

45:32.160 --> 45:39.840
is most thumbed in the Spanish dictionary this predicts it will be C um the uh so um in any case

45:39.840 --> 45:45.600
the the kind of the goal here is to is to is to know things about the world so for example we could

45:45.600 --> 45:52.880
say um I don't know what we let's see what uh let's see what we what we know about Northeastern

45:52.880 --> 45:58.480
University as a as a thing let's see let's look at what properties we might know about Northeastern

45:58.480 --> 46:03.680
University okay let's say somebody was just telling me this number so let me just see what what it

46:03.680 --> 46:10.720
thinks that number is um okay let's see whether we know what that is as a function of time uh

46:12.400 --> 46:21.680
I don't know whether we will but um okay we have something some information here um okay so that

46:21.680 --> 46:27.920
claims to be the um the plot of the number of students as a function of time at Northeastern um

46:27.920 --> 46:33.200
but uh or we could we could say something like let's let's make a um uh I don't know where it

46:33.200 --> 46:40.080
thinks the computer is right now but maybe plausibly here I don't know we'll find out um let's say uh

46:43.760 --> 46:48.560
the somebody's figuring out why the why the plot looks like that

46:48.560 --> 46:54.160
I um it's um um the uh

46:56.960 --> 47:03.520
so let's see whether this um okay so that's just showing us a geodesk of 10 miles around where

47:03.520 --> 47:09.040
we are that's maybe maybe we can just make something just for fun that um has a uh uh

47:09.200 --> 47:19.920
let's say 10 to the 10 to the n miles and let's make a table of these

47:20.640 --> 47:29.280
with um n going from let's say 10th of a mile to let's let's try this so this should make a

47:29.280 --> 47:36.240
series of of kind of um there we go so this is um that's from from very nearby where it thinks the

47:36.240 --> 47:42.160
computer is to very far away where the um the the disk extends to most of the earth actually we

47:42.160 --> 47:49.680
could make that look better by saying let's say geo projection um would be I don't know what's a

47:49.680 --> 47:54.640
good example lambadas might be a good one so it won't make any difference to the local so what we

47:54.640 --> 47:59.520
get locally but it will make a difference when we get to um a larger part of the earth we should

47:59.520 --> 48:08.000
see something more sensible here it's probably it has to recompute all these projections of the

48:08.000 --> 48:13.520
earth so it might take it a little while but in any case the the kind of the big idea is just

48:13.520 --> 48:21.680
to be able to there we go um so that's kind of interesting the the um uh so you know the big

48:21.680 --> 48:28.640
idea is just to know about and to represent the kinds of things that we humans care about

48:28.720 --> 48:33.200
to represent them in computational terms and kind of this has been my effort over the last 40 years

48:33.200 --> 48:39.440
or so is to progressively represent more and more things about the world in this formal

48:39.440 --> 48:44.400
computational way so that we can compute from about them and this is something that's pretty

48:44.400 --> 48:50.320
important because it's something that it gives you this we have now this language for representing

48:50.320 --> 48:55.680
things computationally and if you think about sort of history the um the the a thing a bit like this

48:55.680 --> 49:01.040
that happened before maybe 500 years ago people had the idea of making notation for mathematics

49:01.040 --> 49:05.600
there had been kind of mathematics just described in words and then there started to be notation

49:05.600 --> 49:09.680
for mathematics plus signs and equal signs and things like that and then people started to be

49:09.680 --> 49:15.280
able to talk about mathematics in a streamlined way and then algebra got invented and then calculus

49:15.280 --> 49:20.880
and so on and that kind of spawned the possibility of all of the modern mathematical sciences and so

49:20.880 --> 49:27.600
kind of the question for today is what can we do with this idea of computation how can we use that

49:28.160 --> 49:34.480
in the world and what we realize is for any field x in an archaeology to zoology to whatever else

49:35.120 --> 49:40.480
there is a computational x that you could build which essentially takes the questions of that field

49:40.480 --> 49:45.520
and presents them thinks about them in a kind of formalized computational way and kind of my

49:45.520 --> 49:50.960
goal over the last 40 years has been to build kind of the notation the language to represent

49:50.960 --> 49:56.560
things computationally in the world and and that's um uh it's kind of I think the the thing that we've

49:56.560 --> 50:01.600
achieved at this point is is sort of having made this kind of full-scale computational language

50:01.600 --> 50:06.480
that allows us to represent things in the world computationally and I see you you have a microphone

50:06.480 --> 50:11.840
there and that this is a I could I could talk about I didn't even talk really about AI yet but I can

50:11.920 --> 50:15.600
talk a little bit about let me let me just say a couple of things about that and then then we'll

50:15.600 --> 50:20.320
then we'll move on to then maybe we can we can chat about it some more I mean I think the the

50:20.320 --> 50:25.680
one of the things that's been an interesting thing last year or so is that um uh the um

50:28.240 --> 50:34.800
we used to just have human users mostly um you know millions of people every day use many millions

50:34.800 --> 50:40.800
of people use our stuff as humans but now we have a new kind of user we also have AI's as users

50:40.800 --> 50:53.200
we also have LLMs that are writing um uh that are that are um are um using our technology here's

50:53.200 --> 50:59.200
an example this is a chat notebook and we can say something like um this is a you can say well

50:59.200 --> 51:12.560
let's make um I don't know make a circle that's half green and half blue and that this is now um

51:12.560 --> 51:18.320
let's see what what happens here I have no idea what this is going to do but um this might write

51:18.320 --> 51:25.280
some more from language code it might uh you know what I thought it was going to do usually

51:25.280 --> 51:29.920
tries to do is to actually run that code and see what happens well we can we can run it ourselves

51:29.920 --> 51:34.960
and see what it did it right okay not so bad um in that case it happened to get it right what's

51:34.960 --> 51:39.680
interesting actually is is what you see happening in these chat notebooks um you know we have this

51:39.680 --> 51:46.720
we made this plugin for for uh chat gpt back in when was it that must have been in March I think um

51:46.720 --> 51:53.040
and uh uh that gets pretty widely used but but what's perhaps more interesting is the kind of the

51:53.040 --> 51:58.320
the sort of collaboration that goes on between the human who has some idea what they're trying to do

51:58.320 --> 52:03.600
who try to types it in you get a piece of orphan language code our language is kind of unique in

52:03.600 --> 52:09.520
that it's a language that's intended to be read as well as to be written by humans so it's so the

52:09.520 --> 52:15.440
kind of the loop is typically you the the the thing that is difficult and this is the the part

52:15.440 --> 52:21.680
that is sort of the the education moment is how do you take the thing you might be thinking about

52:21.680 --> 52:27.840
and think about it computationally once you can do that you can begin to explain to the LLM oh this

52:27.840 --> 52:32.960
is roughly what I want to do you explain it in in in human language words it will make a piece of

52:32.960 --> 52:36.960
computational language you can then take that piece of computational language is that what I

52:36.960 --> 52:41.840
wanted I run it I build on it I make it this sort of brick that I start building my whole tower

52:41.840 --> 52:47.280
out of so this is kind of the but the the piece of this that is critical is how do you start

52:47.280 --> 52:52.240
thinking about the world computationally there's not something people teach typically they they

52:52.240 --> 52:56.640
should but they don't it's not what computer science is about computer science a wonderful field

52:56.640 --> 53:03.680
but it's not about that it's you know the thing that is the challenge to reach kind of computational

53:03.680 --> 53:08.480
x for all x which is kind of the future of pretty much every every field at this point because as

53:08.480 --> 53:14.400
I said sort of computation is the formalism is the formalization that we got to figure out how

53:14.400 --> 53:18.880
to do in the last century and it is the thing that is sort of driving the future of these

53:18.880 --> 53:24.240
intellectual areas and so then the question is what you know how do you get to the point where

53:24.240 --> 53:30.560
people can actually sort of conceptualize what they want to do in computational terms how do you

53:30.560 --> 53:35.040
how do you teach this kind of the how to think about things computationally it's not what people

53:35.040 --> 53:40.640
have usually done and actually I guess my project that I'm in the process of doing right now is

53:40.640 --> 53:45.760
actually just about to get started on is because it seems like I'm I'm in the strange position of

53:45.760 --> 53:49.840
being sort of having a responsibility to do this to sort of define what does it look like what is

53:49.840 --> 53:56.160
this kind of basic course that the people should teach very broadly about sort of how to think

53:56.160 --> 54:01.280
about the world computationally the mechanics of how you actually do computation well if people like

54:01.280 --> 54:06.560
like us have done our job most of that has been automated away the LLMs automate even another

54:06.640 --> 54:11.200
stage of that away but what's what's really at issue is how do you think about the world

54:11.200 --> 54:16.960
computationally and and sort of how do you how do you conceptualize that one last thing about AI

54:16.960 --> 54:23.360
the the we can talk about I wrote this whole explainer of chat GPT that some of you might have

54:23.360 --> 54:30.720
seen that that sort of led me to kind of a theory about what's actually going on in LLMs we can

54:30.720 --> 54:34.320
talk about that if people are interested in it but I think one of the things is sort of the

54:34.320 --> 54:38.480
future of AI and people say you know our AI is going to take over the world and what's going to

54:38.480 --> 54:47.760
happen and so on the the question of what does an AI want to do well you know an AI that's been

54:47.760 --> 54:52.400
aligned with what humans you know it's been trained from what humans do that's one thing

54:52.400 --> 54:58.880
but sort of an AI left to its own devices what does it do what you realize is AI's are creatures

54:58.880 --> 55:04.080
of the computational universe and there's just a lot of computational universe out there that AI

55:04.080 --> 55:09.360
sort of could explore and so the question then becomes well where do you want to go and that's

55:09.360 --> 55:13.360
not a question that the AI can there's no theoretical answer to that question there's this whole

55:13.360 --> 55:17.520
computational universe out there that you can explore the question that is the key question

55:17.520 --> 55:22.880
for us humans is well where do we want to explore what what is the what what direction do we want

55:22.880 --> 55:27.120
to go in this computational universe of possibilities and you know when it comes to

55:27.120 --> 55:32.960
sort of things that get automated by AI the kind of jobs that get automated by AI there are lots of

55:32.960 --> 55:37.360
things where we know where we want to go it's a question of the mechanism of how we get there

55:37.360 --> 55:41.920
and that's automatable but the question of where we actually want to go which of the choices we

55:41.920 --> 55:47.120
want to make that's almost by definition not automatable because that's something that we humans

55:47.120 --> 55:51.920
can arbitrarily choose so anyway that that's a that there's much more to say about this this

55:51.920 --> 55:58.400
topic and and so on but that that's just a few a few things maybe we can chat about all right well

55:58.400 --> 56:11.600
I should stop there thank you very much and and now we will go to the fireside chat with Stephen

56:11.600 --> 56:17.680
and Sam Fayad the secretary director of the institute and at the end we will have a Q&A with

56:17.680 --> 56:23.840
all the audience welcome everyone to to this portion where we are going to take audience

56:23.840 --> 56:30.000
questions and what we'll try to do is alternate between audience and some fireside chat questions

56:41.680 --> 56:48.240
issues that that came up late so let me let me start maybe with a question from me which is

56:49.040 --> 56:55.680
you know pretty practical over a decade ago maybe almost 15 years ago you launched

56:55.680 --> 57:02.720
well from alpha and it was a I mean in my opinion it was a very effective amazing semantic search

57:02.720 --> 57:10.080
based you know approach that's much more knowledge based than what we see today with with the LLMs

57:10.800 --> 57:17.680
and the autocomplete and all of that I would say one thing it's not about searching what what we

57:17.760 --> 57:22.880
what wolf mouth it does is it takes you know the natural language people the weird natural language

57:22.880 --> 57:28.880
people set up as questions and it converts that into computational language and then it tries to

57:28.880 --> 57:33.760
compute answers so there's no you know what one might think is there's the web out there and there's

57:33.760 --> 57:38.320
stuff to search for that's not what we're doing right what we've what we've tried to do is to

57:38.320 --> 57:43.680
sort of collect and curate all of this knowledge implement the actual algorithms and methods and

57:43.680 --> 57:49.360
so on and then compute and the thing that is sort of the interface to the humans is take that

57:50.160 --> 57:55.280
piece of natural language somebody types in and or says to a phone or whatever else it is

57:55.280 --> 58:00.000
and convert that into this precise computational language and then compute answers so that that's

58:00.000 --> 58:06.160
that's kind of that's the way I know and that's fair but there you used kind of what what we would

58:06.160 --> 58:11.840
consider concepts that are familiar to humans the way we think about the world yes versus

58:12.720 --> 58:18.320
today's other lambs are just building building weights now what happens for the autocomplete

58:18.320 --> 58:27.760
but what happened is somehow chat gpt took off much more than wolfram alpha any any kind of

58:27.760 --> 58:34.320
thinking or explanation as to why that but 14 years later the world's a bit different but I think

58:34.320 --> 58:41.120
also you know the set of people who want to write essays is a different set from the set of people

58:41.120 --> 58:47.120
who want to answer factual questions I mean you know wolf mouth are pretty widely used in

58:47.120 --> 58:51.120
intelligent assistance the thing that's more interesting is why did the intelligence assistants

58:51.120 --> 58:57.440
die just before LLMs happened and that's really more of a business question than it is a question

58:57.440 --> 59:03.120
of a business and execution question more than it is a question of technology I think but I think

59:03.120 --> 59:14.160
the you know what's what's the goal of alpha has been to to you know to take the question the

59:14.160 --> 59:19.200
things that questions that are answerable from factual questions about the world that are

59:19.200 --> 59:23.600
answerable that we can compute answers to and make it automatic to make those to do those

59:23.600 --> 59:30.000
computations and that's been a very successful thing now the combination of that LLMs are doing

59:30.000 --> 59:35.040
something different LLMs are doing things like writing essays and summarizing text and so on

59:35.040 --> 59:43.920
and I think it's worth remembering that you know LLMs took four billion web pages and you know

59:43.920 --> 59:50.560
what an LLM is doing is to give you something is to continue up from a prompt in a way that is

59:50.560 --> 59:58.160
typical of what the LLM read from the web and that's and now what's interesting is that a certain

59:58.160 --> 01:00:03.120
you know that things like logic were sort of extracted by the LLMs as a certain amount of

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:09.360
factual information that the LLM sort of thinks it knows now the LLM will will regularly just

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:13.920
make up stuff that's kind of roughly like what's out there might be like what some student might

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:18.720
write as a as a well I'm going to write something is roughly right but it's actually total nonsense

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:25.280
the the combination of the LLMs with computational system with Wolf-Malpha for example is pretty

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:32.160
interesting the challenge is you know so back in well in last December actually talking to the

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:38.240
opening AI guys and so on we figured out yes you know Wolf-Malpha has this is very convenient because

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:43.600
there's this interface language and that interface language is English that both the LLMs understand

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:49.920
and Wolf-Malpha understands and so if you can get the LLM to formulate its question in a way that is

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.160
sort of a a crisp question it can just go ask Wolf-Malpha and so we built that capability

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.640
interestingly we also built the capability of having the LLMs synthesize Wolf-Malpha language

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:07.120
code because it had read and we we got a big chunk of training data of kind of you know pieces of

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.520
Wolf-Malpha language code it had read a bunch of Wolf-Malpha language code and it was able to

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:17.120
synthesize those things so now if you look at the the the plug-in for chat GPT at least as of

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.800
few weeks ago I haven't looked more recently sort of interesting that about half of the what the

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:28.720
LLM constructs is Wolf-Malpha queries and half of it is Wolf-Malpha language code and so and then

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:34.080
it's running those things and it gives back the answer and often it does a good job I mean I would

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:38.640
say that it's kind of it's kind of terrible because you know things like math word problems have been

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.920
a long time kind of interesting AI test and there's a case where you know you give it this math word

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:49.840
problem and the LLM correctly decodes it into this lovely piece of Wolf-Malpha language code

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:56.000
we run the code we get an answer and I was writing something about this a few months ago and I'm

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.200
about to put this thing in and I think I better actually check that the LLM you know correctly

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:06.400
took the thing from the internal computation and gave the right answer and it didn't so at the very

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:12.080
last stage the thing just you know went crazy I mean it's interesting you know we've been building

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:18.960
an AI tutor for education purposes it's an interesting problem the number one thing to

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:25.600
know about building AI tutors is it's not easy yes and that's but we've been building this and

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:30.800
it's sort of interesting to see these this whole interface between sort of the computation

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:37.280
this hard computation and the layer of kind of linguistic interface that exists that you know

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.360
we think we're able I don't know we don't know yet but but it looks promising that we're able to

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:47.040
actually provide that interfaces kind of in a personalized way to students and so on but I

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:52.480
think I I think I diverted your question actually you give a good answer and you anticipated half

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:57.680
my next question I want to switch over to the audience but because you anticipated half my

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:10.400
question so using using the LLM or the chat GPT as kind of an alternative input interface to prompt

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:14.640
alpha is one way to think about them working together is there another way do you think there's

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:23.760
a way to leverage a lot of the knowledge encoded in alpha to help LLMs perform better well look

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:30.880
the the fact that you have a few hundred billion weights that encode three things three kinds of

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:36.560
things kind of the structure of language a certain amount of common sense and the third thing which

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.680
is facts about the world facts about the world don't belong there they're an incredibly inefficient

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:48.800
way to encode facts about the world and what will happen but it's not an easy research problem

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.920
is to factor out facts about the world from the linguistic interface in the common sense

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:59.280
now you know the fact is that the very interesting thing that's happened is that LLMs have discovered

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.120
something that we probably should have discovered a couple thousand years ago which is that human

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:07.840
language has that there's you know we've known about the syntactic structure of human language

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:13.600
kind of the things like you know sentences have noun verb noun in them but what we what we haven't

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:20.240
known is the more sophisticated construction kit that says the sentence you know the moon

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:28.160
eight happiness or something that that sentence isn't a plausibly meaningful sentence except in

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:33.600
some percent of poetic sense and so there's this kind of construction kit that goes beyond

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.640
the mere sort of the the syntactic grammar of language there's kind of a semantic grammar

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:44.560
of language I think that the LLMs kind of show us exists and so one question is if you say well

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:49.760
can we extract that semantic grammar of language and if we do extract that how much has that actually

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:55.840
removed the you know the LLMs are still useful as a thing to kind of you know right now we say okay

01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:02.400
well let's go from LLM you know human language to LLM to computational language but that's

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:08.880
further than going from human language to a semantic grammar to to computational language

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.720
and so in fact one thing we've been working on I long wanted to build this kind of what I've

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:18.800
called in the past a semantic discourse language although I hate that name and if somebody can

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:23.520
come up with a better one I'd like it um but that it's kind of a there's been sort of this idea

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:28.400
that's existed well certainly since the 1600s since people like Leibniz and so on of making a

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:34.800
kind of he used to call it the characteristic a universalis kind of universal language to represent

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:41.040
things in some sort of formal way I've been long interested in building such a thing and and now

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:47.200
with help from LLMs it's looking to be actually possible to do that and how that will interface

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.760
with LLMs what it will look like in the end my guess is there'll be a layer of kind of neural

01:05:51.760 --> 01:06:00.800
neti kind of linguistic user interface going to computation and a semantic language that

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:07.040
that then is the place where kind of the the more um where the crunchy computational stuff

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:12.480
happens I mean the thing to realize about LLMs one thing to realize about LLMs is you know

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:17.360
back in the day before we had any idea of formalization what humans figured out was just what

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:21.920
they could figure out sort of off the top of their head um then we got these ideas of formalization

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:27.760
and we started building these kind of bigger towers what LLMs are naturally able to do is the same

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:31.600
kind of stuff we can do sort of off the top of our head and that's you know the architecture of an

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:38.560
LLM is right now mostly you just say there's this you know you you've you've given a set of tokens

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:44.720
that is what you've said so far you say to the network what should the next token be and it ripples

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.880
through a few hundred layers of neural net and out comes the probabilities for what the next token

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:53.200
should be and that's that's the whole story it's just rippling through that that and the only way

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:59.040
that it ever gets to do sort of a more sophisticated computation is is kind of that that the next

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:04.880
token it makes depends on all the previous tokens it made and that's a very thin way I mean there's

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:08.640
a little bit you can you can kind of one fun thing we've been playing with recently it's what you

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:13.920
might call quantum LLMs where instead of just looking at one path of what comes next you look at

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.040
this whole whole network of what comes next and you can do things like path finding and that network

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:23.600
so you can say I want to get to this particular thing at the end what is the path that gets me to

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:28.320
that thing at the end and you can kind of think about that in a slightly different way but but

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:33.280
fundamentally that they're just dealing with kind of they're these different things there's this

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:38.720
invention of computation last last hundred years few hundred years which is this kind of different

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:43.840
prong that we can build that is that's different from what sort of ordinary human thinking let

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:51.920
let's one do so any questions from the audience let's start with you thank you for the very

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:57.120
interesting talk my question is about the the part of your talk that had to do with

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.280
deriving simple computational rules to explain essentially all the physics

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:10.800
so I guess my my question has to do with the fact that you know we have these I guess you

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:15.680
you call them math right physical principles things like Schrodinger's equation and things like this

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:24.080
that you know quantum mechanics they allow us to make predictions about outcomes of experiments or

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:29.120
you know the procession of a planet or something like this you know it allows us to make useful

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.600
predictions about the world and if we have a computational set of rules that allow us to

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:42.240
explain all of physics is there some way to go from those computational rules to mathematical

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:47.200
principles or other sorts of principles that allow us to make useful predictions about the world

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:53.840
that don't require running the computation and and how does that clash with this notion of

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:58.720
computational irreducibility that you mentioned good question okay so slightly complicated I mean

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.600
so first thing to say is sort of the main way that we validate that we know what we're talking

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:08.240
about is that we can derive the existing mathematical laws if it wasn't for the fact that we could

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:13.200
derive general relativity we wouldn't imagine that we have a good idea of what the sort of

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:19.040
low-level machine code of spacetime is okay so first thing to say second thing is there are for

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:25.600
example that black hole simulation that I showed actually is it's the method of going from this

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:30.960
underlying discrete spacetime to deduce what happens seems to be at best competitive with

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.880
and possibly much better than what people have done in the past which is to start from the

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:39.360
mathematical equations and then kind of discretize them so that they can put them on a computer

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:44.720
this is a you can think about it as a sort of an alternative way to by simulation figure out what's

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:49.600
going to happen in the world and because in fact when you do it sort of mathematically

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.440
when people work out black hole mergers they don't work out the pure algebraic math I mean they

01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:00.960
typically use mathematical to do a big pile of reduction of the original mathematical structure

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.480
and then they turn it into something which is a bunch of partial differential equations

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.800
which they discretize and run on a computer so this is this is kind of going the other way

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:14.960
so that's that's one thing to say the the next thing is that the okay the a remarkable thing

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.840
about the universe is that anything in it is predictable what you might think is given computational

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:24.720
irreducibility the whole universe is going to be unpredictable one thing about computational

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:29.040
irreducibility is whenever there's computational irreducibility there is always there are always

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:34.160
an infinite number of slices of computational reducibility that exists so in other words

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:39.040
when the whole thing is computationally irreducible you can always find some sub-piece

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:45.360
that is computationally reducible and it's those sub-pieces that make up the laws that we find useful

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:51.040
to be narratives about how the world works and that we kind of exist in and so the really the

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.200
story of what's happened with our physics project is there's underlying computational

01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:02.400
irreducibility and for observers like us we pick out certain slices of computational reducibility

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:07.360
those slices of computational reducibility correspond to the physical laws we know so one

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:11.920
interesting question would be will there be a time when we found all physical laws or when we've

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:17.280
made all inventions we figured out all of technology the answer is no and the the reason for that is

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:22.480
because of computational irreducibility that we found a particular slice but there will be an

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:27.440
infinite number of other slices and these are other views of the world other things we can say

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:32.560
about the world that aren't that that are different from what we've said so far and in fact you can

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:38.400
think of technology as being these little places where there's this whole amount of computational

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:43.040
irreducibility but there's this little place where we discovered this thing where we could jump ahead

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.600
this little little piece of reducibility and that's sort of a piece of technology in a sense that's

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:52.080
kind of the the economic value that we're providing it's kind of like you could take all the components

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:57.120
of an iPhone and they would have a certain value or you can put them all together into this iPhone

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.040
and you've got this thing that you can think of as sort of a little piece of computational

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:08.320
reducibility that that provides value economic or or sort of the ability to kind of do something

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:13.120
we wouldn't otherwise be able to do so so the thing to realize is there's this sort of infinite

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:21.200
set of possible laws to discover there's a and that's some that's the big question is which

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.840
things do we humans care about there's an infinite set of things out there that could be discovered

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:31.760
there's an infinite set of kind of things we can deduce about the world some of them we find useful

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:37.040
we turn into technology and so on and some we just sort of shrug our shoulders and say we don't know

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:41.760
what we're going to do with that like fluid turbulence is a good example of that for some

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:47.920
purposes at least it's like the fluid behaves randomly what do we do with this it's not so I

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:55.120
mean in terms of our so I mean I think our models provide some kind of almost philosophical framework

01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:00.800
for thinking about this kind of this kind of interplay between computational reducibility

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:06.560
computational irreducibility the challenge right now with our models is there are things where they

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:12.880
reproduce existing physics and there are places where they don't there are places where maybe there's

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:17.680
a little corner where you see something that isn't existing physics and that's obviously really

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:22.880
interesting because you can do experiments and find out if that's really true or not and that's

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:28.160
that's it's a big it's it's a challenge because it's just a lot of technical detail of figuring

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:32.240
out okay a photon is propagating through a piece of fractional dimensional space what does that

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:36.960
actually do how does it affect this or that thing that you can measure but that's you know that's

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:44.960
the challenge and and you know I think the as I say the the way to compute things that we have

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:48.960
here it's a bit different from the existing way so for example in this case of general relativity

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:53.680
we're able to actually do a bit better than existing methods same with quantum circuit

01:13:53.680 --> 01:14:01.520
optimization actually there's using our multiway system technology somebody who's been working on

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:07.520
project sort of takes quantum circuits compiles them into multiway systems does optimization

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.640
at that level and then turns them back into traditional quantum circuits and that won a

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:16.960
competition a few months ago for the best sort of quantum circuit optimization which was kind of fun

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:24.080
we actually Osama have a bunch of questions coming in from our virtual attendees so I will

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:30.960
alternate okay so let me and what you said basically I mean the an interesting observation you made

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:35.920
which is how interesting is that universe of computationally reducible things and how far

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:44.320
can we get but my question is let's get a bit more pedantic a bit so before Sam Altman had his

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:53.680
unfortunate incident with his board open AI was talking about a very near term big breakthrough

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:59.200
in AI whether that's truth or rumor or whatever it doesn't matter I would like to ask you do you

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:06.080
think there's an interesting kind of breakthrough class thing that could happen in the near term

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:12.880
for AI at least in your intuition well I mean okay so look at the history of the AI okay so we've

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:17.680
got you know McCulloch and Pitts wrote their paper in 1943 you know now we've got chat gbt it's

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.360
actually pretty similar in architecture to what McCulloch and Pitts I was just looking at the

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.080
McCulloch Pitts paper just a couple of days ago it's that they had this idea of what they called

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:33.280
psychons they didn't make it but a lot else in that paper did make it the psychons were units

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:41.200
of psychological activity basically the in any case the the you know I I personally have been a

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:46.720
little bit involved in this business since probably about 1980 I first sort of tried to make neural

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:51.760
nets do something around 1980 and I couldn't get them to do anything very interesting so and then

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:58.320
you know in this you know neural nets were always kind of a sideshow type thing oh there might be

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:03.600
models of brains we don't really know maybe brains don't work that way you know a neural net's useful

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:08.080
as algorithms well they've been used for OCR but you know not clear how useful they are for other

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:14.240
things they were always sort of a mysterious kind of sideshow type type thing and then 2011 kind of

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:20.640
the sort of deep learning breakthrough in image recognition happened almost by accident and there

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:26.160
was this jump in the ability to recognize not just the letters of the alphabet but also a few

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:32.000
thousand other kinds of things in the world of cats and dogs and things like this and you know if

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.280
you look at that time I think it reached like 85 percent success from that particular sort of jump

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:43.680
in capability in the in the years since then there's been sort of gradual incremental sort of

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:48.480
improvement in object recognition using neural nets you know the big breakthrough happened and then

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:52.640
there's gradual improvement same things happen in a bunch of other areas whether it's speech to text

01:16:53.520 --> 01:17:00.320
other kinds of things the big breakthrough with LLMs that nobody expected was that one went from

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:06.400
language models to just babbled rather uninterestingly to language models that made essays that seemed

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:11.520
human like and that was a you know it's a big big breakthrough and I think we still don't understand

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:18.720
why that really happened how that happened and you know it probably well you can speculate on

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.960
on it's a science question it's a very interesting science question we've studied it a bit I can tell

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:28.080
you a few I think this field of LLMs science is a really important area it should be more

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:33.280
populated by physicists actually because that's the that's the domain that has a lot of the the

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:38.080
kind of relevant expertise I mean you know I've been I've been pointing out for a while you know

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:42.160
there's like you increase the temperature you know the chance that you pick a word that isn't the

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.760
the most highest probability word to come next increase the temperature it looks like some

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:52.400
student at our summer school this last year found there are two distinct phase transitions one where

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:58.800
the LLM you increase the temperature the LLM stops making sense second it stops making syntactic

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:03.120
sentences the two distinct transitions at definite temperatures why does that happen

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.080
there's got to be an answer to that and it has some combination of physics question

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:11.520
and a question about kind of the structure of knowledge and the structure of the way we think

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:16.400
about things it's a it's a it's a thing that's out there and sort of LLM science but anyway what

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:21.840
seems to have happened is there are these moments where there these kind of you know rapid you know

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.720
these breakthroughs where things things change and then it's kind of an incremental process and this

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:33.040
is typical of technology and science you know some methodology is you know is comes in some

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:38.160
some something happens the way I see what's what's happened right now with LLMs the you know

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:43.920
they have created the possibility of having rich linguistic interfaces to things and there are

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.480
many applications for that and the question of what will be successful and what will not

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:54.000
has to do with how you put a harness around that capability because it's like saying you know it's

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.760
it's um uh the the you know the raw capability kind of I think is what it is it will get

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:03.440
incrementally better but it is what it is and it's like a lot of things in machine learning people

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:07.200
say oh I'm going to use machine learning for this or that there's a very simple heuristic

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:11.440
machine learning is going to get you 80 percent maybe it's 90 percent maybe it's 93 percent you

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:17.680
know and Wolf Malfoy we've now got to 98 success and in recognizing our you know natural language

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:23.040
understanding but you know it's some percentage and some fraction of the time is going to fail

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:29.920
if you've got a use case where getting 85 success is a win like you're saying here are possible

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:35.440
search results are any of these what you're interested in then it's a win to have 85 success

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:38.880
if you're trying to you know launch a rocket to the moon and it's got to actually

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.520
go in the right trajectory 85 success is probably not going to be good enough yeah

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:48.800
and so it's a bad use case and this is the kind of interplay between what's sort of computational

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:54.080
and what's sort of LLM AI style and I think in terms of sort of the breakthroughs that will

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:59.600
happen I mean I think you know there is more to be done this kind of quantum LLM thing there's

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:05.680
more to be done with kind of where you can where you can go you know the planning aspects of sort

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:10.480
of interfacing what amounts to sort of theorem proving techniques with kind of LLM techniques

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:16.800
I'm not sure how well that's going to work the you know one of the lessons of kind of the

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:22.560
developments of neural nets particularly has been anytime you think you can be clever turns out you

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:28.240
it's not worthwhile and that's a it goes along with what I found in the computational universe

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:32.960
you say oh I know I've got this particular kind of system I know it can't do anything interesting

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:38.160
I can just foresee it can't do anything interesting you run the experiment my little statement to

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:41.920
myself and people who work with me is you know the computational animals are always smarter than

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:47.440
we are we you always it will do something that is completely unexpected and and that's been so

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:52.240
you know I'm not sure whether sort of you know carefully orchestrating these things is ultimately

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:57.920
going to make a difference as a practical matter you know video you know what we've done with text

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:03.040
will be doable with video you can learn a lot on video there's a large corpus of video there'll be a

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:08.080
bunch of there'll be a breakthrough as you know it manages to learn sort of intuitive physics

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:12.240
from videos and things like this certain amount of human behavior stuff from videos probably

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:17.600
and that will be you know that's another thing and and that's but I think what you'll see is

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:23.920
these set of discrete sort of jumps as as different things become possible and you know the training

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:28.480
data in the world is is you know we're kind of running out of that there's I mean there's a there's

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:35.600
about a hundred billion not yet tapped actually we're involved in in possibility of tapping

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:42.720
some more of that of other kinds of material that exists in textual form that hasn't yet been used

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:46.960
for training I don't know how useful that will be I don't know at what point you saturate in terms

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:53.040
of yes we know human language and yes we know common sense but my feeling is that the big value

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:59.600
is coming in the application of of LLMs and so on and figuring out how you put

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:04.960
the right harness around them to make them useful and and that's some and it's kind of in fact the

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:08.720
the kind of you know we built into our language now a bunch of LLM functions

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:13.600
where you can from the computational language you can access the LLM and that's a pretty useful

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:19.280
way to sort of understand and and set up kind of the harness around the LLM to make the LLM do

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:25.040
what it does well and then sort of the the computational structure go around that cool

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:31.760
shall we take a question from online sure so a few a couple hundred people are still here

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:39.040
with you till the very end I'm going to take a question from Michael Carell what's so great

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:45.840
about computation as a metaphor structuring principle for physics or cognition we've been

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:52.080
wrong about metaphors for cognition in the past parentheses the brain as watch telegraph switch

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:59.600
board or even metaphors within computational views what makes us think we've gotten the right one

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:06.080
this time okay so it's a good question I mean I think that the the thing that's interesting

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:15.920
is that this idea of rules for specifying things that idea is pretty much as oldest civilization

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:21.760
and it's you know the question of well is it this particular kind of rule is it the rule that

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:27.280
runs with you know that makes a watch work is it the rule that wakes you know integrals work and

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:35.120
so on those particulars yes those particulars are are specific possibilities the general idea

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:42.320
that something follows some set of rules seems to be a you know a pretty fundamental idea I mean

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:46.960
we're we're kind of stuck with that idea that's a that's a thing if we want to have a theory about

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:53.040
how the world works then the idea that there are rules that determine what happens is something

01:23:53.040 --> 01:24:00.000
that we're pretty much stuck with but I think it's a it's a good you know did we did we finally make

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:06.000
it well you know if it turns out the experiments get done and this theory of physics that we built

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:13.360
is validated um it's you know frankly it's it it seems at this point to me at least quite impossible

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:18.960
that it could not be true because too much has fit together for it to you know for it to be off track

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:24.000
but if that happens then we can say well we reached you know in some direction we reached the end

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.040
we know our universe is set up this way we can know that we can so another thing to explain

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:36.560
whenever what is natural science you know natural science is this bridge between the universe as it is

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:43.200
and our attempt to have a narrative in our minds for how the universe works so in other words the

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:49.680
universe does what it does and the question is can we have a way of thinking about that that we

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:56.560
can understand and so there may be many ways of thinking about it that that that is more on us

01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:01.200
than it is on the universe there may be many ways that aliens could understand the universe

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:06.320
that are not the ways we understand the universe but I think that this idea of of operating according

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:12.560
to rules is this thing that has been you know a feature of the way we have thought about things

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:17.760
from the beginning of our of our history and that that seems like a pretty solid thing if we're

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:23.280
trying to do this thing a bridging between the universe and and the way that the way that we

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:28.640
think about things I want to say one thing about cognition and LLMs okay so so people had wondered

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:34.160
for a long time how do brains work and people said well brains do things that are so sophisticated

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.400
that even the laws of physics as we know them aren't sufficient to cover what brains do there

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:45.040
must be some funky extra stuff quantum mechanics whatever else that's going on in brains LLMs

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.840
are a very good data point that isn't true because people had said you know in order to do all these

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:53.840
things that we do and all the language and everything like this we got to have all kinds of

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:59.280
stuff we don't understand turns out just this neural net this simple rule-based neural net

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:04.800
it pretty much does it and so you can and in fact what's happened in neuroscience for instances

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:09.440
back in the day my my friends in neuroscience always said well we got these neural nets

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:13.840
but they're not really models of brains they're really some idealization that may be useful for

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.880
technology etc etc etc now that neural nets clearly do things that are very brain-like

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:24.880
that that that narrative has reversed and now it's a question of well you know we've got we

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.920
know what the core mechanisms are now let's see how we map those into what we can see biologically

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:38.880
is your question quick all right so I don't know if you have a mic but you can I'll repeat your

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:56.400
question just stated for example if we want to learn new interesting structures how can we use

01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:01.920
AI to discover them without you know doing simulation and then looking for patterns in those

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:07.280
can we actually use it to find out yeah that's a good question right so the question is using AI

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:11.920
go ahead yeah you know can AI solve science this is a there's a very current question

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:18.240
and that's not a short question but anyway actually we have a project right now that is

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:24.640
you know day by day is is making progress on this question so here's here's what we seem to be finding

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:30.960
not not this this thing hasn't fully landed yet so I don't know the full story but so a question is

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:35.360
what can you predict with another lamp what can another lamp predict I show it pictures of cellular

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:40.160
automata things like this can it you know can it just say this is what's going to happen

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:46.560
can it to what extent can it at least find the pockets of reducibility we don't know fully the

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.560
answer to this but there's clearly a boundary we can see there are cases where it just doesn't work

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:55.920
and there are cases where it definitely does work and so the you know this question of can it notice

01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:00.960
patterns that we haven't noticed so in protein folding for example there's been a fair degree

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:05.920
of success a little bit less success perhaps than people sometimes imagine but there's been

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.720
some success in taking I mean when you if you feed a random sequence of amino acids and say how

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:16.000
does this fold the answer probably won't be right but in things that are at least somewhat close to

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.400
proteins that have already been but whose structure is already known there's there's a lot that can

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:26.640
be said and the question is why does that work and the general belief is that it works because

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:32.160
there are aspects of protein structure which are features that we humans have not noticed

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:39.440
that the that the system noticed okay and and so this idea that it's noticing things that we didn't

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:44.480
notice is is going to be a very common thing I mean even even an image identifier that's telling

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:50.080
cats from dogs how does it tell cats from dogs well it's found some feature of those pictures

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:54.480
maybe it's the pointiness of the ears or something it's found some feature that allows it to make

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:59.440
that distinction we don't you know that's not necessarily a feature that we know about it's

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:04.320
also very hard for us to tell what feature it found because we don't have a way to kind of

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:10.800
go inside its mind and convert its way of thinking about things to our ways of thinking about things

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:17.440
so you know in terms of of what can we learn about science so first question is can the LLM

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:22.320
when there is some sort of feature that allows prediction to happen can the LLM find that and

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.880
be able to make predictions my guess is that that will be generally somewhat successful

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:33.440
but I think computational irreducibility is kind of a big sort of you know it's a big monster

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:38.320
at the gates there that will prevent certain kinds of things from from being possible but

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:44.560
some things where a human could go and find these these rules yes the LLM might be able to do that

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:52.800
more efficiently more automatically first point so second point is um in well another point is

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:57.840
can the LLM invent something that is a way of explaining to us humans how something works

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:06.240
that's essentially the problem of the AI tutor can the can the system learn enough about us humans

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:11.840
that it can give us an explanation that is useful for us as humans and my guess is there'll be some

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:16.560
success in that in other words if I want to learn some new thing you know how difficult is it to

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:22.720
learn something well you know if I had an AI that knows everything I know for me personally I happen

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:29.600
to be a enthusiast of personal data so there's 50 million words that I've said or written that are

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:37.520
out there so I can train an LLM to be a pretty good you know simulation of me and given that what

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:44.320
you know if I then if I know if the LLM knows or the AI knows what I know and then I say well

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:50.080
I'm today I'm trying to learn about macroeconomics you know I want to you know how do I understand

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:55.360
this there's a reasonable chance that the LLM is going to say well you can relate that to this thing

01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:00.400
you know and that thing you know and I have a much easier path to be able to learn those things

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:05.600
it's another thing another thing to say about about what LLMs potentially do one of the

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:10.960
interesting things that LLMs do is they essentially do what one might call sort of a generalization

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:15.520
of statistics that relates to text so normally you know you have a bunch of numbers you say what's

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:19.920
the mean what's the variance of these numbers these kinds of numerical sorts of things but if you've

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:27.920
just got a big lump of text and you say what was the most popular hat style in the 1950s that's a

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:32.480
textual question and that's a question where there's not you know turning that into numbers

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:38.480
is not so easy but LLMs can actually go purely at the textual level and answer a question like that

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:43.920
and so there's this pure sort of textual statistics you might call it it's not really statistics in

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:49.280
the ordinary sense of numbers it's some new kind of thing that can be sort of deduced textually

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:54.320
and I think the the other one thing that will happen is there are these you know one way that

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:59.440
science advances is through these kind of analogies between one field and another to notice that oh

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:04.160
what happens in metamathematics is like what happens in general activity well that's something

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:07.760
that you know I'm very proud of being able to notice that as a human because I know something

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:11.760
about those two fields and I can kind of connect them up but I suspect LLMs are going to be able

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:15.840
to figure those kinds of things out too because they're going to be able to see that the structure

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:22.320
just like they can they can kind of extract logic from just the patterns of sentences so they'll

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:28.560
extract principles from from kind of the noticing that these two different areas work the way they

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:33.840
work but I mean this question of can the LLM invent a formalism that is useful for us humans

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:38.000
that's a that's an interesting good question I'll tell you one little micro data point so you know

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.880
I spend a lot of my life doing computational language design and you know we quite often

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:47.520
livestream these things and so on but one of the things that's new in the version of

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:51.680
Wolfman language it's just about to come out is there are new functions that are in there

01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:58.080
that were suggested by an LLM so in other words the LLM has looked at all this code it knows what's

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:03.360
people are asking about it's seen what's out there on the web it said oh there's a function

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:08.400
you should have a function called digit sum and I think it even suggested that name and it's a

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:13.680
pretty good idea it's taken sort of the average of what people out there want and yes you can you

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:20.160
can digit sum is something that's a trivial kind of idiom in Wolfman language but it's noticed

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:24.960
that that's an idiom that's a repeated idiom and that's kind of the essence of language design

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:29.360
and so we're able to take that suggestion from LLM by the way in terms of how LLMs will be used

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:34.160
compiling the wisdom of the crowds basically yes yes into I mean what one thing to say about how

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:39.680
LLMs will be used I have a feeling one of the big uses of LLMs will be offline uses people are a

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:44.640
lot of constant people are concentrating on I've got an LLM in the loop and I'm typing something

01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:50.240
and an LLM is responding to that for example for our purposes when we do data curation LLMs have

01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:57.120
basically speeded up many parts of our data curation pipeline by a matter of two not a hundred

01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:02.880
but two and two is worth having but it's not um but I think that these these offline uses where

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:08.880
you use the wisdom of the LLM and then you burn it into a piece of technology that's going to be a

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:14.800
an important thing given given that we'll well over time and before we I'm very bad at short

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:20.640
answers I apologize I'll ask you one last question given your amazing optimism about

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:26.480
the capabilities of LLMs now and you alluded to some of this in in your talk many have claimed

01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:36.720
that AI poses a future existential threat to humanity others disagree vehemently what's your

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:43.680
view on this and what do you think are kind of the main AI threats of today but let's let's talk

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:49.360
about the existence yeah yeah right I mean okay so you know more and more things in the world will

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:55.840
be delegated to AIs that's just just as a matter of convenience because things have to happen quickly

01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:01.920
you know it's we're going to delegate stuff to AIs and then the question is okay so you know

01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:07.280
does something terrible happen as a result of that the thing to understand is there's all

01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:12.160
this stuff going on in the in the world of the AIs and the kind of underworld of the AIs the world

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:16.800
is being run by AIs let's say and we say well we don't understand what these AIs are doing that's

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:22.000
terrible how can we possibly exist in a situation where the world is being run by forces we don't

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.040
understand actually we've been there before because that's the situation we're in with nature

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:32.880
nature is doing a lot of stuff we don't understand and we have managed to find ways to exist we find

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:40.160
found niches where we can sort of carve out our existence you know within nature and it works just

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:45.280
fine I mean occasionally bad things happen you know hurricanes develop and bad things happen

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:50.960
and we don't understand quite why those happen and you know we gradually maybe can do a science of

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:56.480
you know the atmosphere or something and figure that out with AIs the same is going to happen

01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:00.480
there's going to be lots of stuff that goes on and mostly it's going to be just fine and we

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:04.640
understand how to live in that niche and occasionally some crazy thing will happen

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:09.280
and we'll say we better build more science that allows us to understand sort of what's happening

01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:15.200
in the underworld of the AIs so to speak so the first thing to say another thing to say is well is

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:19.360
there going to be anything for the humans anything left for the humans to do or we have automated

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:25.600
everything it's by definition we will not automate everything because a lot of what has to be done

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:31.520
is to figure out what we want to do and there is no sort of intrinsic way that the AI does that now

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:36.560
there's a practical matter I looked at the last 150 years or so of what what people have done as

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:42.160
occupations so to speak and here's what you see in you know in the 150 years ago agriculture was the

01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:50.480
biggest chunk of sort of US occupations and then it got automated and so that chunk shrunk and you

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:54.320
see the same thing happening over and what happened to that chunk what happened to those people well

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:58.960
the answer is they went into lots of different occupations many of which were enabled by the

01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:04.160
automation of agriculture and the same thing has happened over and over again that's something that

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:10.080
takes a lot of people to do it it ends up getting automated that thing goes to almost zero people

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:15.840
but those that the the very automation of that thing enables a bunch of new capabilities

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:21.120
which then provide a more fragmented kind of story and it's a pretty common thing you see in

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:25.600
in economies around the world more developed economies are more fragmented in terms of the

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:31.840
occupations people do and that's that seems to be you know as as you automate more you and what's

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:37.040
really happening there what's really happening there is the fragmented occupations are sort of

01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:43.200
the frontiers where it's still like what are we going to do in this area and that's something that

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:48.160
takes humans and it's just like you know right now it's kind of fun to see the new occupations I'm

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:54.080
always I you know at a company I I often am entertained by the fact that I'll invent some

01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:59.120
new job category of a thing that people have never heard of before like LLM scientist or

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:06.560
or you know AI psychologist or you know prompt engineer or prompt magician yes yes right exactly

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.240
and these are things that you know it's gosh those have never been and by the way prompt

01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:14.800
engineering is a great use for the you know people say well you're going to be computer

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:19.120
programmer you're going to do stem type stuff the best prompt engineers are the best expository

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:26.480
writers so it's a different skill set that and that happens because the LLMs were trained on

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:30.800
you know the LLMs understand just like other humans understand and so it's sort of not surprising

01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:35.920
that it's expository writing that turns out to be the important skill there so by the way the

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:40.560
combination of expository writing and computation is writing good computational language that that

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:46.400
in itself is another occupational area is is computation editors so to speak who can turn

01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:50.720
bad computational language into good computational language and so on there are there are just these

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:56.960
many different opportunities that that get opened up so I'm you know I think us humans you know

01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:01.360
it's worth realizing if you look at the sort of long arc of history and you say what do people do

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:06.240
a thousand years ago what do we do what do people even think was worth doing a thousand years ago

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:11.280
and then what do we do now many of the things we do today didn't look like they were worth doing a

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:16.240
thousand years ago I mean you know I walk on a treadmill why do you do that it's you know what

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:22.560
a crazy thing to do it's it so you know I think that's what we'll see and one of the things that's

01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:27.760
funny about understanding history in the future and so on is that you might say oh you know everybody's

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:32.320
just going to be playing video games that's a terrible outcome looks to be a terrible outcome to me

01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:39.840
right now from from my viewpoint and you know the you know in 2023 or whatever but it's you know to

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:45.840
the internal impression of the humans so to speak may be a very different story in terms of

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:51.920
of you know what will happen in terms of of sort of when the ai's run central banks when the ai's

01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:57.600
do all these kinds of things and and many of those things will happen and and at a practical level

01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:04.400
there's a question of what can you do with this how can we make the ai's do things we want to have

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:08.560
them do and not do the things we don't want to have them do so first question is well what do we

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:14.400
want to have them do and so you know I've thought a bit I will say this is a for me it's it's an

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:20.080
unfinished question I mean this first question is okay you're making constitution for the world

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:24.400
for a country let's say hopefully not for the whole world hopefully for individual countries

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:31.040
you're making constitution in modern times you've got ai's what do you what are the provisions for

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:37.120
example can an ai own things does an ai have to have an owner you know how do you decide what to

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:41.520
do do you have a democracy where people vote and and check boxes or do you have a prompt

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:46.400
autocracy where everybody writes you know a prompt and it gets fed into an ai and the ai

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:51.440
kind of decides what to do what do you do how do you think about what's possible and first question

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:57.600
is what you know is there a you know what do people want and the answer is obviously not everybody

01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:02.720
is going to want the same thing and that's you know so the idea that you know there's the global

01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:10.720
view this is this is a very bad idea I mean this is you know this is you know this this won't work

01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:18.720
just as you know it hasn't just not a not a thing that that works in the way that humans who believe

01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:24.720
in free will and things like that set the world up but so so first point is I think that you know

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:29.440
I've thought quite a bit about this kind of ai constitution question and what sorts of provisions

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:35.680
you might imagine in wanting to set up it's not easy to understand how those constraints get applied

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:40.320
etc etc etc and certainly there's not going to be one kind of this is the ai constitution of the

01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:45.760
world we're finished type thing um but even figuring out those provisions is surprisingly hard

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:50.800
and and I've I've you know it's surprisingly little has been done on this second thing the thing

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:55.680
that I've now come to think more about because I think it's it's a more promising direction

01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:01.680
is if one ai if there's just one ai in the world I think it's a very brittle situation

01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:06.960
the reality is there's not going to be one ai in the world there's going to be a whole society of ai's

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:12.080
and the society of ai's will operate in some way that probably has many of the same dynamics as human

01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:17.840
society and the society there will be some inexorable features of the ai society just as

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:22.480
presumably there are inexorable features of human society and economics and things like this

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:27.360
so there's a science question about what are those inexorable features what does the society of the

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:32.480
ai's look like and how do we you know are there dynamics for the society of ai let me give you

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:37.920
one example it's unthought out okay so but let me make a meta comment the meta comment is if you

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:43.200
look at the history of things like governance and democracy and so on you know big things happened

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:47.520
a few hundred years ago that was a time when there was a lot of political philosophy was being thought

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:52.480
about and people figured stuff out in political philosophy and that turned into actual governance

01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:58.400
systems that have been reasonably successful over the last few hundred years and you know now is the

01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:04.480
moment this is the great moment for political philosophy again it's you know and I don't know

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:09.520
that there are very many people who've stepped up to figuring this out but there will be ideas

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:14.560
that will be and they won't be promptocracies probably but it'll be something and there'll be

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:21.040
ideas that are different new ideas enabled by the fact that we live in an ai technological

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:26.160
society so to speak that that become possible I'll give you one example of a kind of thinking

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:31.680
and we will end on that example okay fine now maybe this is a this is maybe not an upper okay so

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:40.400
here's the question question is in human society people sort of to some sense do the right thing

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:46.480
because if they don't do the right thing they suffer for ai's that's a more complicated issue

01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:53.440
because so far as we know ai's don't suffer so how do you get an ai to do the right thing if it

01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:59.520
won't suffer by doing the wrong thing and and so but now what you realize is actually you already

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:05.840
have this issue with humans because you know internally to you how you feel but anything else

01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:11.520
is an extrapolation it's just you're guessing that you have empathy for some other thing so okay

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:17.040
so you can you start thinking about the ai's and what is the operational again I'd say I haven't

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:21.200
figured this out but I just I give this as an example of the type of thinking I think one has to do

01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:30.000
is is you know if there's an ai and it did the wrong thing and it is then removed from ai society

01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:38.160
okay whether the ai internally suffered or not who cares because what matters to the world is that

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:43.440
it was removed from ai society so to speak and so what you realize is that that this kind of the

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:49.280
societal you know is there a dynamics of that society that causes the ai that did the wrong

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:55.200
thing to not be trusted by the other ai's etc etc etc that be to be sort of removed from ai society

01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:01.440
having no kind of imagined not imagining that you are you know the ai itself is making this you

01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:07.280
know making this decision it's as I say not properly thought out but that's just as a

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:12.320
for people interested in philosophy of these things that's just sort of a you know the beginnings

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:17.840
of a thought about how to think through you know sort of responsibility personal responsibility

01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:23.440
in the time of ai interesting okay with that please join me in thanking Stephen for this

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:31.200
extra long edition of our distinguished lecture thank you thank you everyone and see you next

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:34.400
