0	8840	So, welcome everybody, I have a pleasure to introduce Stephen Warfram, I know him many,
8840	14600	many years because I was involved at some point in a different computer algebra system,
14600	22180	you know he's the creator of Mathematica, he's the founder and CEO of Warfram Research,
22180	28080	he also created this semantic search engine Warfram Alpha that you may be well aware of
28080	34240	and now he's using language models, he's author of many books like A New Kind of Sciences
34240	41680	and a very recent book on everything about physics and we are very happy that he accepted
41680	51600	to come today to do the last distinguished lecture of the semester.
51600	58360	So all right, let's talk about, so as far as I'm concerned the kind of the big idea
58360	66000	that is kind of a defining idea probably of our century is this idea of computation and
66000	73120	I kind of view it as being part of a long sequence of efforts that kind of span the
73120	78560	history of our species I suppose in trying to formalize things.
78560	83840	So you know the probably the first step in that was the creation of human language and
83840	89180	the idea that one could instead of just sort of pointing at different rocks and so on,
89180	94520	one could have a kind of symbolic term rock that represents the general category of things
94520	95520	that are rocks.
95520	101800	That was kind of a big step in being able to explain, in being able to abstract things
101800	106880	from the world as it is to something that we can describe in a formal way and kind of
106880	112440	I would say the next another big step in that was the creation of logic, the idea that
112440	117280	one could take a collection of sentences that had the particular forms of particular forms
117280	124280	and say there's something that we can abstract from all these sentences that is a representation
124280	130440	of something that is formal that we can deduce from these sentences and it's kind of interesting
130440	135640	that when we look at the chat GPs of this world and people are sort of amazed oh wow
135680	142680	it manages to do logic well it's been trained from a you know trillion words of stuff that
143320	149840	we humans have put out there on the web and that contains the same kind of forms of speech
149840	155200	that you know Aristotle and folks like that used to originally construct logic it's able
155200	161720	it's one is abstracting from the specifics of language to something that is a more formal
161720	164360	representation of what's going on.
164400	169720	I suppose in the kind of long arc of history the next big thing that's sort of an example
169720	176200	of formalization of things in the world is mathematics that's another kind of way of
176200	182960	formalizing what happens in the world describing things in terms of numbers and algebra and
182960	189960	those sorts of things. And mathematics when it comes to science kind of the last 300 years
190960	197960	sort of mathematics had been the kind of dominant form of formalization used in science
197960	202640	logic was not particularly successful for as a formalization for science mathematics is
202640	209640	sort of the winning one and that's something that has had continued until quite recently.
210560	215520	The big thing that is sort of new last hundred years is this idea of computation the idea
215560	221560	that there you can what is computation as far as I'm concerned it's you specify sort
221560	227560	of precise rules and then you understand their consequences. In mathematics there are particular
227560	233280	kinds of rules that are represented by I don't know algebra and integrals and calculus and
233280	238080	things like that. There are particular kinds of rules that we study in mathematics computation
238080	243440	is about the most general case of studying sort of given rules what are their consequences
243440	249280	and by the way there's sort of a difference in the way that a particular time is handled
249280	253880	when we think about computation as compared to when we think about for example mathematics
253880	258360	in mathematics we might have some equation that has time as a parameter but we kind of
258360	262160	expect we're going to get an answer where we get some formula where time appears in
262160	267400	the formula but we can set that time to be any value we want. When we think about computation
267400	272840	we're thinking about we're given these rules and now we're going to run these rules and
273040	278480	we're going to see what happens we don't get to say oh I'm going to sort of set the value
278480	282080	of time to be this we have to just run the rules and see what happens. Maybe I should
282080	289080	explain some things that this is from the 1980s actually the kind of a big effort of
293080	300080	the question that this I've been talking about kind of computation as a way of thinking
303840	309720	kind of formalizing what happens in the world so one of the things I got interested in back
309720	315800	at the beginning of the 1980s actually was if one is going to make models of nature what
315800	320400	raw material one might one use to do that and kind of the traditional view had been
320400	324960	used mathematical equations and so on my interest was to kind of generalize that and to see
324960	330560	what happens if you use not equations but programs to represent things in the world
330640	336200	and I have to say it's kind of a spoiler for the path of history but in the last 25 years
336200	342040	or so there's been after 300 years of complete dominance of kind of mathematical equations
342040	346880	as ways to model the world computation has become and programs and so on have kind of
346880	353880	become the when new models are created that's almost always what new models get made with
353880	360880	so but the question that I got interested in years ago is when you look at just simple
361160	368160	if you just ask what what kinds of programs might nature use to do the things that it
368200	375200	does and a particular category of such programs that I found convenient to look at are things
375920	383680	that get called cellular automata this is an example of them it's just a line of cells
383680	389560	each one is either black or white and in a series of steps you set the new color of
389560	394000	the cell to be determined by rule that depends on the previous color of that cell and the
394000	401000	previous colors of its two neighbors so if we take that we just say run run that let's
401000	408000	let's let's let's run that for a few steps here let's just show this with a mesh okay
411120	416440	so this is this is using that rule and at every at every cell at every step we're just
416440	421240	applying that rule to determine what the color of the next step cell will be so we have a
421240	426000	very simple rule we get very simple behavior it's kind of like you kind of you might expect
426000	430400	that's what's going to happen well let's let's change this rule a bit let's say we have
430400	436000	something like this we can change it see what it does that's what it does then let's change
436000	443000	it again let's say we do this how we use that rule instead well now we get a slightly more
443680	448400	complicated pattern if we keep it running a little bit longer we'll find that it makes
448400	454480	a nice some kind of elaborate intricate but very nested structure and we might again say
454480	459640	at this point oh you know if the rule is simple then even if the behavior is somehow intricate
459640	466200	there will be some easy regularity to identify in that behavior okay so now you can ask the
466200	470520	question if you're just sort of studying these things from a sort of science point of view
470520	474600	you can ask the question well why don't I just do an experiment why don't I just point sort
474600	479120	of a computational telescope out into this computational universe of possible programs
479120	484760	just find out what's out there so we can try doing that and let's just make a table of
484800	495800	these with any rule number here and let's do let's say the first 64 of these and this is the result
495800	501960	we get so much of the time so ever every one of these pictures is a different rule that we're
501960	507160	using a much of the time you see what happens is really pretty simple maybe there's stripes from
507160	512280	alternating stripes but there's some fairly simple structure that's produced and here are some nice
512320	519400	nested patterns and then this is my all-time favorite science discovery here's rule 30 in that
519400	524040	numbering scheme it does something a bit different let's take a look at that in a bit more detail
524040	530480	let's say let's look at the rule for it here it is and let's look at what it actually does and
530480	535840	that's the result so what's really remarkable about this is the rule is simple starts off
535840	541360	from just one black cell yet the behavior you get when you actually run this rule is something
541440	546320	complicated in fact if you look at the center column of cells here for all practical purposes
546320	554320	they seem completely random and this is this is kind of a big surprise to one's intuition because
554320	558400	this idea that to make something complicated you have to go lots of effort that's what we kind of
558400	563920	learn intuitively from doing engineering if you want to make a complicated thing you have to go to
563920	568400	a lot of effort to build up this whole structure that's going to make that complicated thing but
568400	573600	here we've got something where in a sense effortlessly from this very simple rule we're making a
573600	579720	very complicated thing well back in the 1980s what I was excited about was what that means for
579720	588120	understanding what happens in nature what happens in in in kind of the understanding how sort of
588120	593880	complexity arises in systems in nature and realizing that this kind of phenomenon that we see in the
593880	599680	computational universe seems to be the secret that nature has that lets it makes so many complicated
599680	604200	things that in fact out in the computational universe of possible programs that should pretty
604200	610680	common to find that even very simple rules can generate what appears to us to be very complicated
610680	616200	behavior well maybe it's worthwhile to understand kind of what how we can understand this phenomenon
616200	621040	that very simple rules can produce very complicated behavior what's sort of going on what are the
621040	628840	broader scientific implications of that and the I suppose one of the one of the big the underlying
628840	634680	principle that I kind of came up with in the 1990s now is this thing I call the principle of
634680	641120	computational equivalence so here's how this works we think about what what is this thing doing we
641120	645600	can think of it as doing a computation it's been given some input it's been given a rule it runs
645720	651880	that that that rule with that input it generates some output it's it's a computation like a computer
651880	658320	might run a computation the question is how sophisticated is that computation is that
658320	663920	computation one that is somehow quite straightforward we could just jump ahead and we could do a
663920	670280	better computation figure out the answer or is it the case that this computation is is is a
670280	674840	sophisticated one so the big thing that was discovered about a hundred years ago now is this
674920	679920	idea of universal computation the idea that there exist systems like Turing machines and so on
679920	686000	that have the property that you can just have a fixed piece of hardware so to speak a fixed rule
686000	691680	and yet by changing the initial conditions for the system you can make that system behave like any
691680	696040	other computational system and that's sort of an important idea because it's the idea that makes
696040	702520	software possible it's kind of the idea that drove essentially modern technology as it is but that
702560	710440	idea is says there exists a system that you can build it's maybe it's a microprocessor with a
710440	715200	billion transistors on it that is capable of universal computation what the principle of
715200	720080	computational equivalence says is something much more extreme than that it says whenever you look
720080	724280	at these systems in the computational universe when they're not doing things that are in a sense
724280	730920	obviously trivial then they will tend to be doing things which are as sophisticated computations as
730920	737880	anything can do so it's kind of saying that that something like this system here should be capable
737880	743120	of for example universal computation but more to the point it's the computation you're seeing here
743120	748160	is as sophisticated as the computation that any system can do so what are the consequences of
748160	753560	this well one consequence is if we're trying to predict what this system does then we're doing
753560	760400	that by doing a computation so if we expect that we can sort of jump ahead and say this system
760400	764760	after a billion steps is going to do this what we have to believe is that the computation we can
764760	769720	do is somehow more sophisticated than the computation the system can do so that we can kind of do
769720	774000	that jumping ahead and seeing what the answer is going to be but the principle of computational
774000	778280	equivalence says you're not going to be able to do that it says that the computation you get to do
778280	784040	with your brain your computer your mathematics whatever else is just the same sophistication as
784040	789120	the computation that this little system can do so you can't expect to be able to jump ahead like
789200	794160	that and that leads to this phenomenon I call computational irreducibility which is this idea
794160	799920	that there are things that happen computations that happen which are irreducible in the sense
799920	804240	that to know what's going to get what consequences they're going to have you basically just have
804240	809440	to run that computation and see what happens you can't expect to jump ahead and figure out the
809440	815360	answer with with less steps than actually running essentially with less steps than actually running
815360	819680	the system so here's an example let me show you an example of another one where it's kind of
819680	826320	interesting to see what happens here let's say rule 110 so this one actually happens to grow
826320	834000	only on one side but you see it makes this little structure let's run it for a thousand steps let's say
834560	839040	and the question will be we have that little structure there is that structure going to die out
839040	843680	or is that structure going to keep going forever well if we said if there wasn't computational
843680	850160	irreducibility we could say well we expect there's just some some sophisticated formula we can make
850160	854400	that can jump ahead and say that's what's going to happen in the end to this but with computational
854400	859680	irreducibility the only way we can work out what's going to happen is essentially to follow the steps
859680	865360	and see what happens and if we don't know how many steps we have to follow it's going to be in general
865360	869600	a question which is sort of undecidable to us what's going to happen in the end well let's see
869840	874240	you can run it I think there's three thousand steps enough yeah three thousand steps was enough
874240	879840	we can if you can just about see it you'll see that it pretty much died out maybe it's still got some
879840	885520	possible life to it but what's interesting is that we can't predict that without essentially running
885520	891600	the rule and just seeing what happens so okay so there's so we have that we've discovered this
891600	896960	phenomenon that even very simple rules in the computational universe can produce very complicated
897040	904960	behavior can produce behavior that is uh is it turns out to often be similar to the kinds of
904960	910080	behavior we see in the in the natural world also has this feature that even though we might have
910080	914880	thought you know the big thing about science is you can always jump ahead and predict things
914880	919680	computational irreducibility shows us that's not true there's sort of a fundamental limitation
919680	923360	it's kind of from within science we see there's sort of a fundamental limitation
923360	929440	that prevents that from happening and makes it it so that we kind of just have to simulate things
929440	935200	to see what's going to happen okay so one question you might ask is we found out the very simple
935200	940480	rules can produce very complicated behavior uh how far does that go what kinds of things can
940480	946480	that do can it make you know can it make brain like things can it make universe like things what
946480	950000	can it make let's talk about the universe first because it's sort of the biggest thing we can
950000	957760	talk about um and uh the um so the question is if we look at the physical world what what's
957760	963120	underneath what's the underlying structure of how the physical world gets made could the physical
963120	971040	world in fact be something which can be represented by some simple computational process and people
971040	974880	have wondered you know what what's the sort of fundamental theory of physics for a long time
974880	979600	and people have different views of that and there's been kind of a a bunch of well it's going waves
979600	984320	of optimism and pessimism but about a hundred years ago a lot of progress was made in the invention
984320	989040	of kind of the the core theories of modern physics which are basically statistical mechanics
989040	993200	the theory of kind of what you know things like gases with lots of molecules how that works
993200	997520	the second law of thermodynamics things like that that's one bucket the second bucket uh
997520	1001920	is general relativity the theory of gravity and the structure of spacetime and the third bucket
1001920	1007280	is quantum mechanics and the theory of very small things so to speak so those are the sort of the
1007520	1013840	um the main uh there was sort of a big big advance a hundred years ago or so now in those
1013840	1020960	kinds of areas um the question is okay so what's for example what's underneath those things are
1020960	1026000	those just sort of arbitrary wheel in features of the universe or are they derivable in some way
1026720	1033200	so this kind of seeing things like rule 30 makes one think well maybe there might be some very
1033280	1041760	simple rule that might be able to to explain what's going on well back in the 1990s I started
1041760	1047600	thinking about this made quite a bit of progress actually but the time I suppose physics was in a
1047600	1053120	very um high self-esteem state and it was like string theory is going to solve it you don't
1053120	1059760	need anything else so I worked on other things which turned out to be rather productive and
1059840	1065120	then about four years ago now came back to this question having figured out a lot of other things
1065120	1070080	in the intervening years and having built this big stack of technology I mean in in the the kind
1070080	1074800	of rough summary of my life is that I've kind of alternated between doing basic science and
1074800	1079840	developing tools and technology and it's been a pretty pretty good journey I would say because
1079840	1085200	you know you do basic science it shows you what is conceivable to build in technology you then
1085200	1090800	build the technology that creates tools that let you do more basic science and I managed to
1090800	1096400	iterate this about five times so far in my life and it's built a pretty big tower and from the
1096400	1101920	top of that tower we can now see some pretty neat basic science that's been really exciting to me
1101920	1105680	in the last few years and let me let me tell you a little bit about that and then I'm going to
1105680	1110400	tell you a bit about sort of how that connects to the practical world of of kind of computational
1110400	1117520	x for all x and we'll talk about AI and and whatever else we can we can fit in there all right so
1117520	1122240	let's talk about the fundamental theory of physics and what's underneath the stuff that
1122960	1128960	we experience in the world let's see I probably have a nice visual summary here which I can perhaps use
1132720	1138480	so this is sort of a visual summary of our physics project and as is often the case in
1138480	1142640	science the first thing you have to do to make progress is to realize what was wrong before
1143280	1148720	and one thing that's been assumed the last couple of thousand years is that space is something
1148720	1153600	continuous that you can just sort of space is just this thing where you can say I'm going to put
1153600	1157360	something at this particular coordinate position in space I'm going to put it at some arbitrary
1157360	1163840	position in space turns out that seems to be wrong that space is not a continuous thing space is
1163840	1169600	made of something and a hundred years ago people thought this might be the case actually
1169600	1173360	because a hundred years ago there was a big a little bit more than a hundred years ago so the
1173360	1178640	big argument was is matter continuous or discrete are there discrete molecules or is matter a
1178640	1185280	continuous kind of thing same question for light well it turned out round 1900 people realized no
1185280	1192480	molecules really exist matter is discrete and turns out and light by 1905 and so people realized
1192480	1197600	photons really exist light is also discrete so you know matters discrete light is discrete what
1197600	1203360	about space at that time and actually I just recently I just lost a few days actually learned
1203360	1208640	even another place where sort of most of the physicists so to speak back in the early part of
1208640	1213200	the 20th century thought that space was discrete but they couldn't make it work in fact Einstein
1213200	1218240	has a nice quote from 1916 that basically says in the end space will turn out to be discrete
1218240	1223680	but we don't have the tools necessary to see how that works now a hundred years later
1223680	1229520	turns out we do so the sort of the first first sort of starting point is the realization that
1229520	1236320	space is discrete space is made of discrete atoms of space an atom of space has nothing
1236880	1241360	there's nothing you can say about it other than it's this it's this idealized point this idealized
1241360	1246080	element the only thing that one can say about it is that it exists and it's unique and distinct
1246080	1251440	from other atoms of space and then what can you say about the atoms of space well all you can
1251440	1255200	say is how they're related to each other you can kind of think of the friend network of the
1255200	1262240	atoms of space so you're kind of saying what and that's all you know about these things there's
1262240	1266320	not they're not placed in any kind of you know you're not saying it's in three dimensions and
1266320	1271600	you're placing this particular atom here and so on all you know is there's this giant network
1271600	1276960	that represents the relations between the atoms of space and it's convenient to technically it's
1276960	1283120	convenient to think about it as a hypergraph and an ordinary graph you have two nodes of the graph
1283120	1287440	and they're they're connected by an edge and a hypergraph you can have any number of nodes
1287440	1292080	connected by a hyper edge so it's just technically convenient to think about it as a hypergraph
1292080	1298560	so the structure of space is this hypergraph of atoms of space and basically everything in the
1298560	1304400	universe is just part of this giant hypergraph so all the things that we experience the you know the
1304400	1310400	the electrons the black holes whatever else they're all just features of this giant hypergraph it's
1310400	1314400	kind of like when you if you think about something like water there's a bunch of molecules bouncing
1314400	1319520	around but you can have things like eddies vortices in the water which are structures that have some
1319520	1323920	persistence and it's those kinds of structures that are like the things that we experience like
1323920	1328960	electrons and so on so okay so the the sort of underlying data structure of the universe is this
1328960	1333600	giant hypergraph made of atoms of space and by the way it's a it's a feature of doing very
1333600	1338560	foundational things that there are many equivalent versions of this statement you can talk about it
1338560	1343200	in terms of higher category theory you can talk about it in different terms but I think the most
1343200	1350000	concrete version is it's this giant network that is this hypergraph so then what that's sort of the
1350000	1354960	structure of space the structure of what how does time work by the way one of the things that's sort
1354960	1360560	of a wrong turn in the 100 years ago was this idea that space and time are the same kind of thing
1360560	1364800	it was a kind of idea that was introduced sort of as a mathematical convenience and then it
1364800	1369280	became a thing that everybody explained oh space time is you know space and time are all connected
1369280	1373680	together like that I don't think it's true time is actually something very different from space it
1373680	1380080	turns out that the features of relativity theory that connect space and time emerge from the kind
1380080	1385120	of large-scale properties of the system but they're not the intrinsic way to think about it so what
1385120	1390800	is time well time is this kind of process of computation just like in that rule 30 cellular
1390800	1396320	automaton we've got the series of steps those represent the progress of time and computational
1396320	1401520	irreducibility kind of tells us there's some kind of irreducible thing achieved by the passage of
1401520	1408160	time and so it is in the system instead of it being updating these cells with neighbors and so on
1408160	1415840	it's you say we've got this we've got this graph and we have these rules that just say whenever you
1415840	1420000	see a little piece of graph that looks like this rewrite it to a piece of graph that looks like
1420000	1424400	that and so you keep doing that over and over again and you build up more and more elaborate
1424400	1428800	kinds of graphs you get all kinds of complicated structures like this and one question is when
1428800	1433520	you do that enough times what is the what what you know when you have a graph that has 10 to
1433520	1437520	the 100 nodes or something in it you've built up this way what is the structure of that graph
1438240	1441440	well it's a similar question to asking the question if you have a bunch of molecules
1441440	1446800	bouncing around and they each interact according to some force law and so on what is the large-scale
1446800	1450800	behavior of a whole collection of molecules and the answer we know in that case is it's like fluid
1450800	1455040	dynamics that's what happens in something like water you've got these discrete molecules bouncing
1455040	1461200	around the emergent kind of behavior of the system follows the laws of fluid mechanics
1461200	1465840	okay so what's the analogous thing here well it's pretty neat because it turns out the analogous
1465840	1471520	thing here is the thing follows the Einstein equations which are the the the corresponding
1471520	1478080	laws for the structure of spacetime and so you can then derive from this very simple underlying
1478080	1483040	set of rules that are about the rewriting of networks the large-scale limits of that with a
1483040	1490240	bunch of footnotes that are a complicated story you can derive the fact that you get the structure
1490240	1495280	of spacetime that that we observe now actually one of the things that's tricky is this thing
1495280	1498720	doesn't have any space in it at the beginning it doesn't even know that it's in three dimensions
1498720	1503120	for instance dimension is something that's an emergent property of the system where you're
1503120	1507440	basically saying if you start from a given node in this in this graph and you say what how many
1507440	1511920	nodes do you get to by going a certain distance on the graph a certain number of steps in the
1511920	1517600	in the graph let's say you get to some number of nodes and that number of nodes grows like r
1517600	1523360	the distance to the power d then you can identify that d as the dimension the effective dimension
1523360	1527920	of the space so one of the consequences of this model is that space won't be precisely three
1527920	1531760	dimensional there'll actually be dimension fluctuations probably the the beginning of the
1531760	1536080	universe will be infinite dimensional gradually the universe kind of cools down to being the
1536080	1541200	three dimensions we observe today and they're probably dimension fluctuations left over from
1541200	1545760	the other universe and an interesting kind of current sort of can we figure out how this
1545760	1550560	works question is what actual experimental signatures there are from such a phenomenon
1551440	1557440	but anyway so so by the way let me just show you um see if I can find this uh yeah let me let me
1557440	1564080	just show you in this model um this is kind of the uh what the the a version of the beginning
1564080	1569760	of the universe in this kind of model where so we're we're seeing here the progressive rewriting
1569760	1577760	of uh kind of this network of atoms of space and uh this is the first very small amount of time
1577760	1583520	in at least one branch of the beginning of the universe um you have to keep going a long way
1583520	1587520	to get to our current universe and because of computational irreducibility that's not something
1587520	1597120	I'm going to be able to do on my laptop however the um uh the thing that um you can set things
1597120	1602240	up to kind of see what would it be like if you had a much bigger chunk of space and this is an
1602240	1609760	example yes okay so this is much later in the history of the universe these are two little
1609760	1615440	black holes and what you'll see here is the the uh that sort of the background here is the structure
1615440	1620160	of space and space is kind of knitted together by all these little rewrites that are happening if
1620160	1626240	it wasn't for all these rewrites space would fall apart the space the the fact that there is this
1626480	1631680	thing we can think of as space that is kind of it has extent is a consequence of the of the
1631680	1635360	progression through time of all these rewrites but anyway here are two little black holes and you
1635360	1640880	can see what they do the space is is wiggling around a lot these two little black holes actually
1640880	1646480	feel the force of gravity um that's just a consequence of these rewrites and then those
1646480	1652960	black holes merge well that's something that we observe in uh that's gravitational wave detectors
1652960	1657280	have observed the merger of black holes these are incredibly tiny black holes turns out very
1657280	1661280	conveniently the behavior of a very tiny black hole is pretty much the same as the behavior of a
1661280	1666400	very big black hole so we can actually start to see and when when these black holes merge and this
1666400	1671520	little simulation here um turns out they emit gravitational radiation and we can start seeing
1671520	1675840	the properties of their gravitational radiation and one of the current frontier questions is
1675840	1681440	whether there are features of that gravitational radiation that reveal the discreteness of space
1681440	1685120	and uh I think I think it's it's fairly promising that there are although
1685120	1689520	whether the magnitude of the the things is such that we can detect it now
1689520	1693760	versus a hundred years from now we don't know yet that yet but anyway that's kind of
1693760	1699920	how the the structure of space works in in these these kinds of models another thing to to mention
1700320	1711680	is uh another so I mentioned this um um the um the the question of um these sort of three big
1711680	1718160	theories of of 20th century physics statistical mechanics general relativity and quantum mechanics
1718160	1721840	so we've got what I've been describing is the derivation of general relativity people didn't
1721840	1726080	think general relativity was something you could derive from something lower level it looks like
1726080	1731360	it is so the another piece to this is quantum mechanics and sort of the big idea of quantum
1731360	1737200	mechanics is in classical physics you imagine that definite things happen in the world in
1737200	1741680	quantum mechanics the big idea is that you know you throw a ball and it doesn't just follow a
1741680	1746560	single trajectory it follows many possible trajectories and you just get to figure out
1746560	1752400	what the probability of different things happening is well in our models we actually have no choice
1752400	1757440	but to have quantum mechanics because what happens is that I talked about the rewriting of these
1757440	1762000	hypergraphs that represent the structure of the space and everything in it there are many possible
1762000	1766480	ways these rewritings can happen and the results of that is that you get what we call a multiway
1766480	1771280	graph that represents all the different possible paths of history there can be different rewritings
1771280	1776400	that happen there can be that can cause these paths of history to branch they can merge and so on
1776400	1781440	so kind of the the big thing that happens that you get these multiway graphs multiway graphs are
1781440	1786240	something pretty interesting that that sort of related to nondeterministic computation but in
1786240	1791280	nondeterministic computation you tend to just say we're going to pick the one winning branch
1791280	1795840	in multiway computation you're interested in sort of all the possible things that can happen
1795840	1800000	and so you know you can kind of think about lots of different kinds of problems in these
1800000	1805360	terms you know you've got a game like tic-tac-toe or something there are many possible paths you can
1805360	1812000	follow to in the in the doing of that game and you can kind of look at the complete graph that
1812000	1816800	you get let's see if I can just pull up a picture of that so you know a typical kind of thing would
1816800	1825120	be here we go it's kind of a multiway graph that just shows given that you're starting with a blank
1825120	1829840	tic-tac-toe simplified tic-tac-toe board you get this kind of graph of all these possibilities
1829920	1832960	you keep going somewhere here probably there's a picture of the actual
1833920	1839520	game and and what it takes to win the game and so on but that that's an example of a multiway
1839520	1846640	graph in that particular case for just a the game of tic-tac-toe but the the whole point is
1846640	1851440	there is also a multiway graph for the whole structure of our universe and the fact that
1851440	1856400	there are these different paths is is the reason that we get quantum mechanics since it's slightly
1856400	1861600	more complicated story we have when you when you kind of take a slice across all those paths
1861600	1866000	you form this kind of space we call it branch real space the space of quantum branches
1866000	1870720	which is kind of its own kind of space and just as you can think about kind of motion
1870720	1874000	and physical space you can also think about motion and branch real space
1874000	1879920	just as you can think about observing physical space we we notice that in physical space well
1879920	1887360	okay the the we we are at a scale much larger than the atoms of space and so we aggregate when we
1887360	1893440	observe what physical space is like what we're observing is this this vast aggregation of atoms
1893440	1899200	of space and that's why space seems to us continuous well something a bit similar happens in quantum
1899200	1905040	mechanics what happens is that just as we are extended in physical space we are also extended
1905040	1910640	in branch real space and so a rather strange thing it has to do with the fact that an observer
1910640	1916560	like us that has that is part of this universe that's branching emerging and so on the question
1916560	1922000	of quantum mechanics becomes how does a branching brain perceive a branching universe and turns
1922000	1927760	out that when you untangle those things the answer is quantum mechanics so okay just to
1927760	1935760	finish on this in this branch for a second the the thing so one of the one of the questions would
1935760	1940880	be okay so we've got this model for physics and we can say there's an underlying rule which if we
1940880	1946320	run it for long enough we'll make our universe so the next question is well why did we get that rule
1946320	1952160	and not another rule and that's it's sort of a you know that's a kind of the the Copernican thing
1952160	1957040	would be to think there can't be anything special about the rule we got we just have to have some
1957040	1962880	sort of very arbitrary rule well the the thing that I wondered about this for a while and then
1962880	1969680	we realized that actually here's what's going on the the structure I mentioned that given a
1969680	1974240	particular rule you apply to no possible ways and that's what gives you quantum mechanics
1974240	1979120	but why do you have just one particular rule what happens if you apply all possible rules
1979120	1984480	and you make something which is the result of taking all possible computational rules
1984480	1989040	and running them and you can see that different rules will produce different results but then
1989040	1993600	those results might converge again because when you run different rules again they'll converge to
1993600	1999440	the same results and so on you get this big complicated entangled mess that is the the result
1999440	2004080	of running all possible computations so you it's kind of you make this thing which is the
2004080	2009200	entangled limit of all possible computations it's the thing we call the rule ad and it's kind of the
2009200	2014080	it's an encapsulated object that represents everything that is computationally possible
2014640	2018560	and it's a it's a kind of an interesting object because it's a very it's a necessary object it's
2018560	2024720	not an object that you say oh it happens to exist in this way in that way it's just given the idea
2024720	2030160	of computation there is just a single object that is this rule ad that represents all possible
2030160	2035440	the entangled limit of all possible computations okay so so what so how do you make how do you take
2035440	2044240	that and understand sort of how we we perceive physics and things like this well the key thing
2044800	2049680	is this realization that we are a certain kind of observer of this rule ad we are it's a little
2049680	2054560	bit of a brain twisting kind of thing because we are embedded within this rule ad we are part
2054560	2061920	of this rule ad and we are observing what happens in the rule ad and turns out that there are we
2061920	2066480	might say well well what we observe to be happening in the rule ad depends on what we are like as
2066480	2071520	observers so the question is do we how much do we have to know about what we're like as observers
2071520	2076160	to conclude what about what we will perceive happens in the rule ad okay so it turns out
2076160	2081760	there are two key assumptions about us as observers both of which are pretty uncontroversial one is
2081760	2087840	that we are computationally bounded we we can only in our sort of finite minds we can only fit a
2087840	2093040	certain amount of computational effort it's point one point two is we believe we are persistent in
2093040	2098640	time even though at every moment in time we might be made of different atoms of space we believe
2098640	2104480	that we have a single thread of experience that continues throughout time so those are two assumptions
2104480	2108640	so it turns out this is sort of the big result of the last few years it turns out those two
2108640	2115760	assumptions are sufficient to derive the three big theories of 20th century physics so given this
2115760	2121200	idea of the rule ad if you say what does an observer with those characteristics perceive in this big
2121200	2126720	messy rule ad of all possible computations it turns out that an observer with those characteristics
2126720	2132080	necessarily perceives actually the second rule of thermodynamics general relativity and quantum
2132080	2138080	mechanics that's kind of a very interesting kind of I suppose philosophical moment that these are
2138080	2142400	things which seemed like they were just features of the universe that happen to be the way they are
2142400	2147920	but it isn't true that there instead there is this kind of necessary formal structure
2147920	2153680	which for observers like us if we were not like we are if we were some kind of alien observers
2153680	2159200	with different characteristics we would perceive a different physics but given that we are observers
2160000	2164400	of the kind that we are we necessarily perceive these features of the physical world
2164400	2171200	so that's that's kind of a that's a that's a sort of a big deal in in in thinking about physics
2171200	2175520	it also turns out to have implications about mathematics and the kind of nature of mathematics
2175520	2180400	and so on can talk about those but let me let me talk about some more practical kinds of things so
2180640	2187520	we we've kind of understood something about this idea of computation that ends up sort of going all
2187520	2192160	the way down it gives us the machine code for the universe it seems and it tells us things about
2192160	2198880	sort of the sort of the big picture of what's computationally possible well it's okay so here
2198880	2207200	we are as just humans hanging out in this rule ad and and and the question is how do we access
2207280	2213520	this kind of this the the how do we what can we access of computation and so then we have the kind
2213520	2219600	of interesting situation we are humans who think about things in certain ways and what do we you
2219600	2226160	know how can we make use of this kind of power of computation that sort of is the intrinsic thing
2226160	2231440	that runs the universe and so on and and what you start realizing is that you need some kind of bridge
2231440	2236640	between the way we think about things and the sort of ocean of computational possibilities
2237200	2242320	much of what's out there in the computational universe is stuff that is completely incomprehensible
2242320	2246960	to us it's stuff where we can run all these cellular automata they make all these patterns
2246960	2250800	we say we don't really know what the significance of this is they're not really connected to anything
2250800	2257840	we know about most of the computational universe is completely alien to us and so the the question
2257840	2263840	really becomes sort of how do we characterize the parts of the computational universe that we humans
2263840	2268640	can connect to his sort of perhaps an interesting experiment I can show you something here this
2268640	2278800	is looking with genitive AI um just looking at um the uh yeah this is um this is looking at um
2278800	2284800	sort of a very tiny slice of the rule ad that has been set up to be aligned with the way we humans
2284800	2290080	think about things because it's been it's a genitive AI trained on a few billion images
2290080	2294080	and so what we're asking is if we look out into that sort of space of possible
2295440	2300080	possible things that we can think of as a tiny slice of the rule yard what's out there and so we
2300080	2306800	we said okay let's let's make a we initially say we're going to look for a cat and a party hat
2307360	2315520	and um somewhere at the beginning there was um was a part of um of this uh of the space that
2315600	2321040	has a nice cat there the question is what else is out there in the space if you go away from the
2321040	2326240	cat and the party hat you go out um and you're you're going out into sort of this space of
2326240	2330640	computational possibilities and what you find is there's sort of a cat island where things are
2330640	2337840	sort of identifiably cat like but then most of sort of this space consists of things that
2337840	2341920	well there's some definite structure there but it's not clear what we humans would say about
2341920	2347520	that structure we don't really have a a way of thinking about that we think about so we can kind
2347520	2353760	of think about think about these sort of blobs of of possibility that are concepts of things we've
2353760	2359920	given human names to we've given words to their concepts we know about and then there's this vast
2359920	2365680	area of kind of inter concept space kind of analogous to interstellar space where it's something
2365680	2372320	that we haven't you know we humans have not conceived we don't have a way to that we brought
2372320	2378000	that into our kind of world and so you might ask well what fraction of space is inter concept space
2378000	2384480	in this very simple example that's a very sort of optimistic case one part and ten to the six
2384480	2391520	hundred of the space is space that we understand uh the rest of it is all inter concept space
2391520	2396640	concepts that we humans have not yet reached so you can kind of think about the the progress of
2396640	2402000	of our uh intellect and science and so on as being this kind of colonization of what we call
2402000	2408320	rural space of kind of gradually expanding in the domain of what we consider what we have concepts
2408320	2415040	to describe it's some uh kind of a okay to make a slightly bizarre comment but but one thing you
2415040	2419680	might wonder about is okay in the future of science and everything maybe the future of
2419680	2424480	science is we expand in in rural space and we we eventually expand so that we fill all of rural
2424480	2429360	space it turns out one should be careful what one wishes for because one feature of that
2429360	2435760	is that in in in a sense went by by the time you have a mind that is that big it is not a coherent
2435760	2441680	mind anymore and for it to coherently exist it has to be something that is limited in rural
2441680	2446880	space by the time it fills the whole rulliard in no meaningful sense does it coherently exist
2446880	2453840	so in a sense when you when you if you expand too far uh you you you no longer can can describe
2453840	2461680	yourself as as coherently existing so okay so so there's there's this um uh this is kind of what
2461680	2467920	what it looks like out in this sort of human aligned uh inter concept space this is this is
2467920	2474400	kind of what what it looks like just in sort of out in the rulliard looking at different possible
2474400	2480160	behaviors these are just cellular automata um but we can say well when we look at these things
2480160	2485360	what are these things how do we describe them are they things that are relevant to to us yet do we
2485360	2490720	yet have words for these things and the answer is typically no we've we've explored only this tiny
2490720	2496320	slice okay but so what can we do with the slice that we're exploring well the big thing that i've
2496320	2502640	spent much of my life actually doing is trying to build kind of a a a thing that is a bridge between
2502640	2508880	the way we think about things and what's computationally possible and the way that what we what we
2508880	2514000	need to do is to take the things that we care about that we think about and formalize them so we
2514000	2519200	represent them computationally so that we can make use of kind of the power that exists in this
2519200	2524400	computational universe and so that has been the the big effort to build what we call wolfman language
2525120	2532560	um and sort of the goal there is is to be able to represent sort of everything in the world
2532560	2537600	in a computational kind of way so i mean if i take um uh well let's just let's just say you
2537600	2544400	know i have um i don't know some uh let's let's say i make some graph uh we can we can represent
2544400	2550000	some random graph as as a computational kind of thing we could say i don't know let's work out
2550720	2555920	let's just do some computation on that and the um uh um
2557760	2562560	well we could take um uh we could take some let's see if i can um take an image here
2563600	2572560	ah what if i do that um let's see there we go well terrible image but um we could we could say
2572560	2579680	something like um uh well let's just say something like edge detect that image um or we could say
2580000	2586400	we want it to be a little bit more optimistic let's see um how about we do this how about we say
2589520	2591040	let's do this um
2593760	2599600	let's take that image and let's say we want to just say identify what's in that image but let's
2599600	2606480	let's run it this way so we're running some neural net we can look at um uh we may have to load in
2606480	2613200	oh what earth is that i have no idea what that is um it's the back it's the backdrop okay
2616560	2620960	okay let's see well let's let's see what happens if we say what's the word definition of that thing
2622560	2632960	ha okay the um but it's kind of interesting to um uh we can look here if we say uh well that that
2632960	2640000	thing will just be some neural net that um uh we can look at it's all the all the all the nasty
2640000	2646800	innards of it we could for example just say let's just take the first uh five levels of the neural
2646800	2656800	net or something and apply that to this picture um and uh and then maybe we can say uh make images
2656800	2662640	out of those okay so that's kind of the the uh inside the mind of the neural net um what it's
2662640	2668080	thinking about maybe we can just say let's let's just do this let's say make a feature space plot
2668080	2673440	of those let's see if we can not very exciting it just decided that there were two clumps of
2673440	2677280	things that was thinking about one seemed like they're mostly white one seems like they're mostly
2677280	2683840	black so it goes um but but anyway the kind of the concept here is to make a computational
2683840	2689760	language that can formalize the things we like to think about in computational terms
2689760	2695200	so that we can do things uh so that we can use sort of the power of computation to operate on
2695200	2700560	those kinds of things so for example there's the part of the the story is just knowing a lot about
2700560	2705440	the world so we might say you know that's there's a list of words in English maybe we can say let's
2705440	2711760	just take the first letter of each word and let's make a word cloud of those first letters
2712320	2717520	and um this will give us oops what did I just do word list oh that's not what I want to do I wanted
2717520	2723520	to say take just the first letters there okay there we go and so that gives us for for English
2723520	2727280	the uh the sort of word cloud of first letters maybe we can just for fun let's try doing
2728080	2732160	Spanish for example I don't know whether anybody knows what the what what part of a dictionary
2732160	2739840	is most thumbed in the Spanish dictionary this predicts it will be C um the uh so um in any case
2739840	2745600	the the kind of the goal here is to is to is to know things about the world so for example we could
2745600	2752880	say um I don't know what we let's see what uh let's see what we what we know about Northeastern
2752880	2758480	University as a as a thing let's see let's look at what properties we might know about Northeastern
2758480	2763680	University okay let's say somebody was just telling me this number so let me just see what what it
2763680	2770720	thinks that number is um okay let's see whether we know what that is as a function of time uh
2772400	2781680	I don't know whether we will but um okay we have something some information here um okay so that
2781680	2787920	claims to be the um the plot of the number of students as a function of time at Northeastern um
2787920	2793200	but uh or we could we could say something like let's let's make a um uh I don't know where it
2793200	2800080	thinks the computer is right now but maybe plausibly here I don't know we'll find out um let's say uh
2803760	2808560	the somebody's figuring out why the why the plot looks like that
2808560	2814160	I um it's um um the uh
2816960	2823520	so let's see whether this um okay so that's just showing us a geodesk of 10 miles around where
2823520	2829040	we are that's maybe maybe we can just make something just for fun that um has a uh uh
2829200	2839920	let's say 10 to the 10 to the n miles and let's make a table of these
2840640	2849280	with um n going from let's say 10th of a mile to let's let's try this so this should make a
2849280	2856240	series of of kind of um there we go so this is um that's from from very nearby where it thinks the
2856240	2862160	computer is to very far away where the um the the disk extends to most of the earth actually we
2862160	2869680	could make that look better by saying let's say geo projection um would be I don't know what's a
2869680	2874640	good example lambadas might be a good one so it won't make any difference to the local so what we
2874640	2879520	get locally but it will make a difference when we get to um a larger part of the earth we should
2879520	2888000	see something more sensible here it's probably it has to recompute all these projections of the
2888000	2893520	earth so it might take it a little while but in any case the the kind of the big idea is just
2893520	2901680	to be able to there we go um so that's kind of interesting the the um uh so you know the big
2901680	2908640	idea is just to know about and to represent the kinds of things that we humans care about
2908720	2913200	to represent them in computational terms and kind of this has been my effort over the last 40 years
2913200	2919440	or so is to progressively represent more and more things about the world in this formal
2919440	2924400	computational way so that we can compute from about them and this is something that's pretty
2924400	2930320	important because it's something that it gives you this we have now this language for representing
2930320	2935680	things computationally and if you think about sort of history the um the the a thing a bit like this
2935680	2941040	that happened before maybe 500 years ago people had the idea of making notation for mathematics
2941040	2945600	there had been kind of mathematics just described in words and then there started to be notation
2945600	2949680	for mathematics plus signs and equal signs and things like that and then people started to be
2949680	2955280	able to talk about mathematics in a streamlined way and then algebra got invented and then calculus
2955280	2960880	and so on and that kind of spawned the possibility of all of the modern mathematical sciences and so
2960880	2967600	kind of the question for today is what can we do with this idea of computation how can we use that
2968160	2974480	in the world and what we realize is for any field x in an archaeology to zoology to whatever else
2975120	2980480	there is a computational x that you could build which essentially takes the questions of that field
2980480	2985520	and presents them thinks about them in a kind of formalized computational way and kind of my
2985520	2990960	goal over the last 40 years has been to build kind of the notation the language to represent
2990960	2996560	things computationally in the world and and that's um uh it's kind of I think the the thing that we've
2996560	3001600	achieved at this point is is sort of having made this kind of full-scale computational language
3001600	3006480	that allows us to represent things in the world computationally and I see you you have a microphone
3006480	3011840	there and that this is a I could I could talk about I didn't even talk really about AI yet but I can
3011920	3015600	talk a little bit about let me let me just say a couple of things about that and then then we'll
3015600	3020320	then we'll move on to then maybe we can we can chat about it some more I mean I think the the
3020320	3025680	one of the things that's been an interesting thing last year or so is that um uh the um
3028240	3034800	we used to just have human users mostly um you know millions of people every day use many millions
3034800	3040800	of people use our stuff as humans but now we have a new kind of user we also have AI's as users
3040800	3053200	we also have LLMs that are writing um uh that are that are um are um using our technology here's
3053200	3059200	an example this is a chat notebook and we can say something like um this is a you can say well
3059200	3072560	let's make um I don't know make a circle that's half green and half blue and that this is now um
3072560	3078320	let's see what what happens here I have no idea what this is going to do but um this might write
3078320	3085280	some more from language code it might uh you know what I thought it was going to do usually
3085280	3089920	tries to do is to actually run that code and see what happens well we can we can run it ourselves
3089920	3094960	and see what it did it right okay not so bad um in that case it happened to get it right what's
3094960	3099680	interesting actually is is what you see happening in these chat notebooks um you know we have this
3099680	3106720	we made this plugin for for uh chat gpt back in when was it that must have been in March I think um
3106720	3113040	and uh uh that gets pretty widely used but but what's perhaps more interesting is the kind of the
3113040	3118320	the sort of collaboration that goes on between the human who has some idea what they're trying to do
3118320	3123600	who try to types it in you get a piece of orphan language code our language is kind of unique in
3123600	3129520	that it's a language that's intended to be read as well as to be written by humans so it's so the
3129520	3135440	kind of the loop is typically you the the the thing that is difficult and this is the the part
3135440	3141680	that is sort of the the education moment is how do you take the thing you might be thinking about
3141680	3147840	and think about it computationally once you can do that you can begin to explain to the LLM oh this
3147840	3152960	is roughly what I want to do you explain it in in in human language words it will make a piece of
3152960	3156960	computational language you can then take that piece of computational language is that what I
3156960	3161840	wanted I run it I build on it I make it this sort of brick that I start building my whole tower
3161840	3167280	out of so this is kind of the but the the piece of this that is critical is how do you start
3167280	3172240	thinking about the world computationally there's not something people teach typically they they
3172240	3176640	should but they don't it's not what computer science is about computer science a wonderful field
3176640	3183680	but it's not about that it's you know the thing that is the challenge to reach kind of computational
3183680	3188480	x for all x which is kind of the future of pretty much every every field at this point because as
3188480	3194400	I said sort of computation is the formalism is the formalization that we got to figure out how
3194400	3198880	to do in the last century and it is the thing that is sort of driving the future of these
3198880	3204240	intellectual areas and so then the question is what you know how do you get to the point where
3204240	3210560	people can actually sort of conceptualize what they want to do in computational terms how do you
3210560	3215040	how do you teach this kind of the how to think about things computationally it's not what people
3215040	3220640	have usually done and actually I guess my project that I'm in the process of doing right now is
3220640	3225760	actually just about to get started on is because it seems like I'm I'm in the strange position of
3225760	3229840	being sort of having a responsibility to do this to sort of define what does it look like what is
3229840	3236160	this kind of basic course that the people should teach very broadly about sort of how to think
3236160	3241280	about the world computationally the mechanics of how you actually do computation well if people like
3241280	3246560	like us have done our job most of that has been automated away the LLMs automate even another
3246640	3251200	stage of that away but what's what's really at issue is how do you think about the world
3251200	3256960	computationally and and sort of how do you how do you conceptualize that one last thing about AI
3256960	3263360	the the we can talk about I wrote this whole explainer of chat GPT that some of you might have
3263360	3270720	seen that that sort of led me to kind of a theory about what's actually going on in LLMs we can
3270720	3274320	talk about that if people are interested in it but I think one of the things is sort of the
3274320	3278480	future of AI and people say you know our AI is going to take over the world and what's going to
3278480	3287760	happen and so on the the question of what does an AI want to do well you know an AI that's been
3287760	3292400	aligned with what humans you know it's been trained from what humans do that's one thing
3292400	3298880	but sort of an AI left to its own devices what does it do what you realize is AI's are creatures
3298880	3304080	of the computational universe and there's just a lot of computational universe out there that AI
3304080	3309360	sort of could explore and so the question then becomes well where do you want to go and that's
3309360	3313360	not a question that the AI can there's no theoretical answer to that question there's this whole
3313360	3317520	computational universe out there that you can explore the question that is the key question
3317520	3322880	for us humans is well where do we want to explore what what is the what what direction do we want
3322880	3327120	to go in this computational universe of possibilities and you know when it comes to
3327120	3332960	sort of things that get automated by AI the kind of jobs that get automated by AI there are lots of
3332960	3337360	things where we know where we want to go it's a question of the mechanism of how we get there
3337360	3341920	and that's automatable but the question of where we actually want to go which of the choices we
3341920	3347120	want to make that's almost by definition not automatable because that's something that we humans
3347120	3351920	can arbitrarily choose so anyway that that's a that there's much more to say about this this
3351920	3358400	topic and and so on but that that's just a few a few things maybe we can chat about all right well
3358400	3371600	I should stop there thank you very much and and now we will go to the fireside chat with Stephen
3371600	3377680	and Sam Fayad the secretary director of the institute and at the end we will have a Q&A with
3377680	3383840	all the audience welcome everyone to to this portion where we are going to take audience
3383840	3390000	questions and what we'll try to do is alternate between audience and some fireside chat questions
3401680	3408240	issues that that came up late so let me let me start maybe with a question from me which is
3409040	3415680	you know pretty practical over a decade ago maybe almost 15 years ago you launched
3415680	3422720	well from alpha and it was a I mean in my opinion it was a very effective amazing semantic search
3422720	3430080	based you know approach that's much more knowledge based than what we see today with with the LLMs
3430800	3437680	and the autocomplete and all of that I would say one thing it's not about searching what what we
3437760	3442880	what wolf mouth it does is it takes you know the natural language people the weird natural language
3442880	3448880	people set up as questions and it converts that into computational language and then it tries to
3448880	3453760	compute answers so there's no you know what one might think is there's the web out there and there's
3453760	3458320	stuff to search for that's not what we're doing right what we've what we've tried to do is to
3458320	3463680	sort of collect and curate all of this knowledge implement the actual algorithms and methods and
3463680	3469360	so on and then compute and the thing that is sort of the interface to the humans is take that
3470160	3475280	piece of natural language somebody types in and or says to a phone or whatever else it is
3475280	3480000	and convert that into this precise computational language and then compute answers so that that's
3480000	3486160	that's kind of that's the way I know and that's fair but there you used kind of what what we would
3486160	3491840	consider concepts that are familiar to humans the way we think about the world yes versus
3492720	3498320	today's other lambs are just building building weights now what happens for the autocomplete
3498320	3507760	but what happened is somehow chat gpt took off much more than wolfram alpha any any kind of
3507760	3514320	thinking or explanation as to why that but 14 years later the world's a bit different but I think
3514320	3521120	also you know the set of people who want to write essays is a different set from the set of people
3521120	3527120	who want to answer factual questions I mean you know wolf mouth are pretty widely used in
3527120	3531120	intelligent assistance the thing that's more interesting is why did the intelligence assistants
3531120	3537440	die just before LLMs happened and that's really more of a business question than it is a question
3537440	3543120	of a business and execution question more than it is a question of technology I think but I think
3543120	3554160	the you know what's what's the goal of alpha has been to to you know to take the question the
3554160	3559200	things that questions that are answerable from factual questions about the world that are
3559200	3563600	answerable that we can compute answers to and make it automatic to make those to do those
3563600	3570000	computations and that's been a very successful thing now the combination of that LLMs are doing
3570000	3575040	something different LLMs are doing things like writing essays and summarizing text and so on
3575040	3583920	and I think it's worth remembering that you know LLMs took four billion web pages and you know
3583920	3590560	what an LLM is doing is to give you something is to continue up from a prompt in a way that is
3590560	3598160	typical of what the LLM read from the web and that's and now what's interesting is that a certain
3598160	3603120	you know that things like logic were sort of extracted by the LLMs as a certain amount of
3604080	3609360	factual information that the LLM sort of thinks it knows now the LLM will will regularly just
3609360	3613920	make up stuff that's kind of roughly like what's out there might be like what some student might
3613920	3618720	write as a as a well I'm going to write something is roughly right but it's actually total nonsense
3619600	3625280	the the combination of the LLMs with computational system with Wolf-Malpha for example is pretty
3625280	3632160	interesting the challenge is you know so back in well in last December actually talking to the
3632160	3638240	opening AI guys and so on we figured out yes you know Wolf-Malpha has this is very convenient because
3638240	3643600	there's this interface language and that interface language is English that both the LLMs understand
3643600	3649920	and Wolf-Malpha understands and so if you can get the LLM to formulate its question in a way that is
3650000	3656160	sort of a a crisp question it can just go ask Wolf-Malpha and so we built that capability
3656160	3660640	interestingly we also built the capability of having the LLMs synthesize Wolf-Malpha language
3660640	3667120	code because it had read and we we got a big chunk of training data of kind of you know pieces of
3667120	3671520	Wolf-Malpha language code it had read a bunch of Wolf-Malpha language code and it was able to
3671520	3677120	synthesize those things so now if you look at the the the plug-in for chat GPT at least as of
3678000	3682800	few weeks ago I haven't looked more recently sort of interesting that about half of the what the
3682800	3688720	LLM constructs is Wolf-Malpha queries and half of it is Wolf-Malpha language code and so and then
3688720	3694080	it's running those things and it gives back the answer and often it does a good job I mean I would
3694080	3698640	say that it's kind of it's kind of terrible because you know things like math word problems have been
3698640	3703920	a long time kind of interesting AI test and there's a case where you know you give it this math word
3703920	3709840	problem and the LLM correctly decodes it into this lovely piece of Wolf-Malpha language code
3709840	3716000	we run the code we get an answer and I was writing something about this a few months ago and I'm
3716000	3721200	about to put this thing in and I think I better actually check that the LLM you know correctly
3721200	3726400	took the thing from the internal computation and gave the right answer and it didn't so at the very
3726400	3732080	last stage the thing just you know went crazy I mean it's interesting you know we've been building
3732960	3738960	an AI tutor for education purposes it's an interesting problem the number one thing to
3738960	3745600	know about building AI tutors is it's not easy yes and that's but we've been building this and
3745600	3750800	it's sort of interesting to see these this whole interface between sort of the computation
3750800	3757280	this hard computation and the layer of kind of linguistic interface that exists that you know
3757280	3761360	we think we're able I don't know we don't know yet but but it looks promising that we're able to
3761360	3767040	actually provide that interfaces kind of in a personalized way to students and so on but I
3767040	3772480	think I I think I diverted your question actually you give a good answer and you anticipated half
3772480	3777680	my next question I want to switch over to the audience but because you anticipated half my
3777680	3790400	question so using using the LLM or the chat GPT as kind of an alternative input interface to prompt
3790480	3794640	alpha is one way to think about them working together is there another way do you think there's
3794640	3803760	a way to leverage a lot of the knowledge encoded in alpha to help LLMs perform better well look
3803760	3810880	the the fact that you have a few hundred billion weights that encode three things three kinds of
3810880	3816560	things kind of the structure of language a certain amount of common sense and the third thing which
3816560	3821680	is facts about the world facts about the world don't belong there they're an incredibly inefficient
3821680	3828800	way to encode facts about the world and what will happen but it's not an easy research problem
3828800	3833920	is to factor out facts about the world from the linguistic interface in the common sense
3833920	3839280	now you know the fact is that the very interesting thing that's happened is that LLMs have discovered
3839280	3843120	something that we probably should have discovered a couple thousand years ago which is that human
3843120	3847840	language has that there's you know we've known about the syntactic structure of human language
3847840	3853600	kind of the things like you know sentences have noun verb noun in them but what we what we haven't
3853600	3860240	known is the more sophisticated construction kit that says the sentence you know the moon
3861120	3868160	eight happiness or something that that sentence isn't a plausibly meaningful sentence except in
3868160	3873600	some percent of poetic sense and so there's this kind of construction kit that goes beyond
3873600	3878640	the mere sort of the the syntactic grammar of language there's kind of a semantic grammar
3878640	3884560	of language I think that the LLMs kind of show us exists and so one question is if you say well
3884560	3889760	can we extract that semantic grammar of language and if we do extract that how much has that actually
3889760	3895840	removed the you know the LLMs are still useful as a thing to kind of you know right now we say okay
3895840	3902400	well let's go from LLM you know human language to LLM to computational language but that's
3903040	3908880	further than going from human language to a semantic grammar to to computational language
3908880	3914720	and so in fact one thing we've been working on I long wanted to build this kind of what I've
3914720	3918800	called in the past a semantic discourse language although I hate that name and if somebody can
3918800	3923520	come up with a better one I'd like it um but that it's kind of a there's been sort of this idea
3923520	3928400	that's existed well certainly since the 1600s since people like Leibniz and so on of making a
3928400	3934800	kind of he used to call it the characteristic a universalis kind of universal language to represent
3934800	3941040	things in some sort of formal way I've been long interested in building such a thing and and now
3941600	3947200	with help from LLMs it's looking to be actually possible to do that and how that will interface
3947200	3951760	with LLMs what it will look like in the end my guess is there'll be a layer of kind of neural
3951760	3960800	neti kind of linguistic user interface going to computation and a semantic language that
3961520	3967040	that then is the place where kind of the the more um where the crunchy computational stuff
3967040	3972480	happens I mean the thing to realize about LLMs one thing to realize about LLMs is you know
3972480	3977360	back in the day before we had any idea of formalization what humans figured out was just what
3977360	3981920	they could figure out sort of off the top of their head um then we got these ideas of formalization
3981920	3987760	and we started building these kind of bigger towers what LLMs are naturally able to do is the same
3987760	3991600	kind of stuff we can do sort of off the top of our head and that's you know the architecture of an
3991600	3998560	LLM is right now mostly you just say there's this you know you you've you've given a set of tokens
3998560	4004720	that is what you've said so far you say to the network what should the next token be and it ripples
4004720	4008880	through a few hundred layers of neural net and out comes the probabilities for what the next token
4008880	4013200	should be and that's that's the whole story it's just rippling through that that and the only way
4013200	4019040	that it ever gets to do sort of a more sophisticated computation is is kind of that that the next
4019040	4024880	token it makes depends on all the previous tokens it made and that's a very thin way I mean there's
4024880	4028640	a little bit you can you can kind of one fun thing we've been playing with recently it's what you
4028640	4033920	might call quantum LLMs where instead of just looking at one path of what comes next you look at
4033920	4039040	this whole whole network of what comes next and you can do things like path finding and that network
4039040	4043600	so you can say I want to get to this particular thing at the end what is the path that gets me to
4043600	4048320	that thing at the end and you can kind of think about that in a slightly different way but but
4048320	4053280	fundamentally that they're just dealing with kind of they're these different things there's this
4053280	4058720	invention of computation last last hundred years few hundred years which is this kind of different
4058720	4063840	prong that we can build that is that's different from what sort of ordinary human thinking let
4063840	4071920	let's one do so any questions from the audience let's start with you thank you for the very
4071920	4077120	interesting talk my question is about the the part of your talk that had to do with
4077840	4081280	deriving simple computational rules to explain essentially all the physics
4081520	4090800	so I guess my my question has to do with the fact that you know we have these I guess you
4090800	4095680	you call them math right physical principles things like Schrodinger's equation and things like this
4095680	4104080	that you know quantum mechanics they allow us to make predictions about outcomes of experiments or
4104080	4109120	you know the procession of a planet or something like this you know it allows us to make useful
4109120	4113600	predictions about the world and if we have a computational set of rules that allow us to
4113600	4122240	explain all of physics is there some way to go from those computational rules to mathematical
4122240	4127200	principles or other sorts of principles that allow us to make useful predictions about the world
4127200	4133840	that don't require running the computation and and how does that clash with this notion of
4133840	4138720	computational irreducibility that you mentioned good question okay so slightly complicated I mean
4138960	4143600	so first thing to say is sort of the main way that we validate that we know what we're talking
4143600	4148240	about is that we can derive the existing mathematical laws if it wasn't for the fact that we could
4148240	4153200	derive general relativity we wouldn't imagine that we have a good idea of what the sort of
4153200	4159040	low-level machine code of spacetime is okay so first thing to say second thing is there are for
4159040	4165600	example that black hole simulation that I showed actually is it's the method of going from this
4165680	4170960	underlying discrete spacetime to deduce what happens seems to be at best competitive with
4170960	4174880	and possibly much better than what people have done in the past which is to start from the
4174880	4179360	mathematical equations and then kind of discretize them so that they can put them on a computer
4179360	4184720	this is a you can think about it as a sort of an alternative way to by simulation figure out what's
4184720	4189600	going to happen in the world and because in fact when you do it sort of mathematically
4190480	4195440	when people work out black hole mergers they don't work out the pure algebraic math I mean they
4195440	4200960	typically use mathematical to do a big pile of reduction of the original mathematical structure
4200960	4204480	and then they turn it into something which is a bunch of partial differential equations
4204480	4208800	which they discretize and run on a computer so this is this is kind of going the other way
4208800	4214960	so that's that's one thing to say the the next thing is that the okay the a remarkable thing
4214960	4219840	about the universe is that anything in it is predictable what you might think is given computational
4219840	4224720	irreducibility the whole universe is going to be unpredictable one thing about computational
4224720	4229040	irreducibility is whenever there's computational irreducibility there is always there are always
4229040	4234160	an infinite number of slices of computational reducibility that exists so in other words
4234160	4239040	when the whole thing is computationally irreducible you can always find some sub-piece
4239040	4245360	that is computationally reducible and it's those sub-pieces that make up the laws that we find useful
4245360	4251040	to be narratives about how the world works and that we kind of exist in and so the really the
4251120	4255200	story of what's happened with our physics project is there's underlying computational
4255200	4262400	irreducibility and for observers like us we pick out certain slices of computational reducibility
4262400	4267360	those slices of computational reducibility correspond to the physical laws we know so one
4267360	4271920	interesting question would be will there be a time when we found all physical laws or when we've
4271920	4277280	made all inventions we figured out all of technology the answer is no and the the reason for that is
4277280	4282480	because of computational irreducibility that we found a particular slice but there will be an
4282480	4287440	infinite number of other slices and these are other views of the world other things we can say
4287440	4292560	about the world that aren't that that are different from what we've said so far and in fact you can
4292560	4298400	think of technology as being these little places where there's this whole amount of computational
4298400	4303040	irreducibility but there's this little place where we discovered this thing where we could jump ahead
4303040	4307600	this little little piece of reducibility and that's sort of a piece of technology in a sense that's
4307600	4312080	kind of the the economic value that we're providing it's kind of like you could take all the components
4312080	4317120	of an iPhone and they would have a certain value or you can put them all together into this iPhone
4317120	4321040	and you've got this thing that you can think of as sort of a little piece of computational
4321040	4328320	reducibility that that provides value economic or or sort of the ability to kind of do something
4328400	4333120	we wouldn't otherwise be able to do so so the thing to realize is there's this sort of infinite
4333120	4341200	set of possible laws to discover there's a and that's some that's the big question is which
4341200	4345840	things do we humans care about there's an infinite set of things out there that could be discovered
4345840	4351760	there's an infinite set of kind of things we can deduce about the world some of them we find useful
4351760	4357040	we turn into technology and so on and some we just sort of shrug our shoulders and say we don't know
4357040	4361760	what we're going to do with that like fluid turbulence is a good example of that for some
4361760	4367920	purposes at least it's like the fluid behaves randomly what do we do with this it's not so I
4367920	4375120	mean in terms of our so I mean I think our models provide some kind of almost philosophical framework
4375120	4380800	for thinking about this kind of this kind of interplay between computational reducibility
4380800	4386560	computational irreducibility the challenge right now with our models is there are things where they
4386560	4392880	reproduce existing physics and there are places where they don't there are places where maybe there's
4392880	4397680	a little corner where you see something that isn't existing physics and that's obviously really
4397680	4402880	interesting because you can do experiments and find out if that's really true or not and that's
4402880	4408160	that's it's a big it's it's a challenge because it's just a lot of technical detail of figuring
4408160	4412240	out okay a photon is propagating through a piece of fractional dimensional space what does that
4412240	4416960	actually do how does it affect this or that thing that you can measure but that's you know that's
4416960	4424960	the challenge and and you know I think the as I say the the way to compute things that we have
4424960	4428960	here it's a bit different from the existing way so for example in this case of general relativity
4428960	4433680	we're able to actually do a bit better than existing methods same with quantum circuit
4433680	4441520	optimization actually there's using our multiway system technology somebody who's been working on
4441760	4447520	project sort of takes quantum circuits compiles them into multiway systems does optimization
4447520	4452640	at that level and then turns them back into traditional quantum circuits and that won a
4452640	4456960	competition a few months ago for the best sort of quantum circuit optimization which was kind of fun
4458480	4464080	we actually Osama have a bunch of questions coming in from our virtual attendees so I will
4464240	4470960	alternate okay so let me and what you said basically I mean the an interesting observation you made
4470960	4475920	which is how interesting is that universe of computationally reducible things and how far
4475920	4484320	can we get but my question is let's get a bit more pedantic a bit so before Sam Altman had his
4485280	4493680	unfortunate incident with his board open AI was talking about a very near term big breakthrough
4493680	4499200	in AI whether that's truth or rumor or whatever it doesn't matter I would like to ask you do you
4499200	4506080	think there's an interesting kind of breakthrough class thing that could happen in the near term
4506080	4512880	for AI at least in your intuition well I mean okay so look at the history of the AI okay so we've
4512880	4517680	got you know McCulloch and Pitts wrote their paper in 1943 you know now we've got chat gbt it's
4517680	4521360	actually pretty similar in architecture to what McCulloch and Pitts I was just looking at the
4521360	4526080	McCulloch Pitts paper just a couple of days ago it's that they had this idea of what they called
4526080	4533280	psychons they didn't make it but a lot else in that paper did make it the psychons were units
4533280	4541200	of psychological activity basically the in any case the the you know I I personally have been a
4541200	4546720	little bit involved in this business since probably about 1980 I first sort of tried to make neural
4546720	4551760	nets do something around 1980 and I couldn't get them to do anything very interesting so and then
4552960	4558320	you know in this you know neural nets were always kind of a sideshow type thing oh there might be
4558320	4563600	models of brains we don't really know maybe brains don't work that way you know a neural net's useful
4563600	4568080	as algorithms well they've been used for OCR but you know not clear how useful they are for other
4568080	4574240	things they were always sort of a mysterious kind of sideshow type type thing and then 2011 kind of
4574240	4580640	the sort of deep learning breakthrough in image recognition happened almost by accident and there
4580640	4586160	was this jump in the ability to recognize not just the letters of the alphabet but also a few
4586160	4592000	thousand other kinds of things in the world of cats and dogs and things like this and you know if
4592000	4597280	you look at that time I think it reached like 85 percent success from that particular sort of jump
4597280	4603680	in capability in the in the years since then there's been sort of gradual incremental sort of
4603680	4608480	improvement in object recognition using neural nets you know the big breakthrough happened and then
4608480	4612640	there's gradual improvement same things happen in a bunch of other areas whether it's speech to text
4613520	4620320	other kinds of things the big breakthrough with LLMs that nobody expected was that one went from
4620400	4626400	language models to just babbled rather uninterestingly to language models that made essays that seemed
4626400	4631520	human like and that was a you know it's a big big breakthrough and I think we still don't understand
4631520	4638720	why that really happened how that happened and you know it probably well you can speculate on
4638720	4642960	on it's a science question it's a very interesting science question we've studied it a bit I can tell
4642960	4648080	you a few I think this field of LLMs science is a really important area it should be more
4648080	4653280	populated by physicists actually because that's the that's the domain that has a lot of the the
4653280	4658080	kind of relevant expertise I mean you know I've been I've been pointing out for a while you know
4658080	4662160	there's like you increase the temperature you know the chance that you pick a word that isn't the
4662160	4667760	the most highest probability word to come next increase the temperature it looks like some
4667760	4672400	student at our summer school this last year found there are two distinct phase transitions one where
4672400	4678800	the LLM you increase the temperature the LLM stops making sense second it stops making syntactic
4678800	4683120	sentences the two distinct transitions at definite temperatures why does that happen
4683920	4688080	there's got to be an answer to that and it has some combination of physics question
4688080	4691520	and a question about kind of the structure of knowledge and the structure of the way we think
4691520	4696400	about things it's a it's a it's a thing that's out there and sort of LLM science but anyway what
4696400	4701840	seems to have happened is there are these moments where there these kind of you know rapid you know
4701840	4706720	these breakthroughs where things things change and then it's kind of an incremental process and this
4706720	4713040	is typical of technology and science you know some methodology is you know is comes in some
4713040	4718160	some something happens the way I see what's what's happened right now with LLMs the you know
4718160	4723920	they have created the possibility of having rich linguistic interfaces to things and there are
4723920	4728480	many applications for that and the question of what will be successful and what will not
4728560	4734000	has to do with how you put a harness around that capability because it's like saying you know it's
4734000	4739760	it's um uh the the you know the raw capability kind of I think is what it is it will get
4739760	4743440	incrementally better but it is what it is and it's like a lot of things in machine learning people
4743440	4747200	say oh I'm going to use machine learning for this or that there's a very simple heuristic
4747200	4751440	machine learning is going to get you 80 percent maybe it's 90 percent maybe it's 93 percent you
4751440	4757680	know and Wolf Malfoy we've now got to 98 success and in recognizing our you know natural language
4757680	4763040	understanding but you know it's some percentage and some fraction of the time is going to fail
4763040	4769920	if you've got a use case where getting 85 success is a win like you're saying here are possible
4769920	4775440	search results are any of these what you're interested in then it's a win to have 85 success
4775440	4778880	if you're trying to you know launch a rocket to the moon and it's got to actually
4778880	4783520	go in the right trajectory 85 success is probably not going to be good enough yeah
4783520	4788800	and so it's a bad use case and this is the kind of interplay between what's sort of computational
4788800	4794080	and what's sort of LLM AI style and I think in terms of sort of the breakthroughs that will
4794080	4799600	happen I mean I think you know there is more to be done this kind of quantum LLM thing there's
4799600	4805680	more to be done with kind of where you can where you can go you know the planning aspects of sort
4805680	4810480	of interfacing what amounts to sort of theorem proving techniques with kind of LLM techniques
4810480	4816800	I'm not sure how well that's going to work the you know one of the lessons of kind of the
4816800	4822560	developments of neural nets particularly has been anytime you think you can be clever turns out you
4822560	4828240	it's not worthwhile and that's a it goes along with what I found in the computational universe
4828240	4832960	you say oh I know I've got this particular kind of system I know it can't do anything interesting
4832960	4838160	I can just foresee it can't do anything interesting you run the experiment my little statement to
4838160	4841920	myself and people who work with me is you know the computational animals are always smarter than
4841920	4847440	we are we you always it will do something that is completely unexpected and and that's been so
4847440	4852240	you know I'm not sure whether sort of you know carefully orchestrating these things is ultimately
4852240	4857920	going to make a difference as a practical matter you know video you know what we've done with text
4857920	4863040	will be doable with video you can learn a lot on video there's a large corpus of video there'll be a
4863040	4868080	bunch of there'll be a breakthrough as you know it manages to learn sort of intuitive physics
4868080	4872240	from videos and things like this certain amount of human behavior stuff from videos probably
4873120	4877600	and that will be you know that's another thing and and that's but I think what you'll see is
4877600	4883920	these set of discrete sort of jumps as as different things become possible and you know the training
4883920	4888480	data in the world is is you know we're kind of running out of that there's I mean there's a there's
4888560	4895600	about a hundred billion not yet tapped actually we're involved in in possibility of tapping
4895600	4902720	some more of that of other kinds of material that exists in textual form that hasn't yet been used
4902720	4906960	for training I don't know how useful that will be I don't know at what point you saturate in terms
4906960	4913040	of yes we know human language and yes we know common sense but my feeling is that the big value
4913040	4919600	is coming in the application of of LLMs and so on and figuring out how you put
4919600	4924960	the right harness around them to make them useful and and that's some and it's kind of in fact the
4924960	4928720	the kind of you know we built into our language now a bunch of LLM functions
4928720	4933600	where you can from the computational language you can access the LLM and that's a pretty useful
4933600	4939280	way to sort of understand and and set up kind of the harness around the LLM to make the LLM do
4939280	4945040	what it does well and then sort of the the computational structure go around that cool
4945680	4951760	shall we take a question from online sure so a few a couple hundred people are still here
4951760	4959040	with you till the very end I'm going to take a question from Michael Carell what's so great
4959040	4965840	about computation as a metaphor structuring principle for physics or cognition we've been
4965840	4972080	wrong about metaphors for cognition in the past parentheses the brain as watch telegraph switch
4972080	4979600	board or even metaphors within computational views what makes us think we've gotten the right one
4979600	4986080	this time okay so it's a good question I mean I think that the the thing that's interesting
4986800	4995920	is that this idea of rules for specifying things that idea is pretty much as oldest civilization
4996560	5001760	and it's you know the question of well is it this particular kind of rule is it the rule that
5001760	5007280	runs with you know that makes a watch work is it the rule that wakes you know integrals work and
5007280	5015120	so on those particulars yes those particulars are are specific possibilities the general idea
5015200	5022320	that something follows some set of rules seems to be a you know a pretty fundamental idea I mean
5022320	5026960	we're we're kind of stuck with that idea that's a that's a thing if we want to have a theory about
5026960	5033040	how the world works then the idea that there are rules that determine what happens is something
5033040	5040000	that we're pretty much stuck with but I think it's a it's a good you know did we did we finally make
5040000	5046000	it well you know if it turns out the experiments get done and this theory of physics that we built
5046000	5053360	is validated um it's you know frankly it's it it seems at this point to me at least quite impossible
5053360	5058960	that it could not be true because too much has fit together for it to you know for it to be off track
5058960	5064000	but if that happens then we can say well we reached you know in some direction we reached the end
5064000	5069040	we know our universe is set up this way we can know that we can so another thing to explain
5069680	5076560	whenever what is natural science you know natural science is this bridge between the universe as it is
5077200	5083200	and our attempt to have a narrative in our minds for how the universe works so in other words the
5083200	5089680	universe does what it does and the question is can we have a way of thinking about that that we
5089680	5096560	can understand and so there may be many ways of thinking about it that that that is more on us
5096560	5101200	than it is on the universe there may be many ways that aliens could understand the universe
5101200	5106320	that are not the ways we understand the universe but I think that this idea of of operating according
5106320	5112560	to rules is this thing that has been you know a feature of the way we have thought about things
5112560	5117760	from the beginning of our of our history and that that seems like a pretty solid thing if we're
5117760	5123280	trying to do this thing a bridging between the universe and and the way that the way that we
5123280	5128640	think about things I want to say one thing about cognition and LLMs okay so so people had wondered
5128640	5134160	for a long time how do brains work and people said well brains do things that are so sophisticated
5134160	5138400	that even the laws of physics as we know them aren't sufficient to cover what brains do there
5138400	5145040	must be some funky extra stuff quantum mechanics whatever else that's going on in brains LLMs
5145040	5149840	are a very good data point that isn't true because people had said you know in order to do all these
5149920	5153840	things that we do and all the language and everything like this we got to have all kinds of
5153840	5159280	stuff we don't understand turns out just this neural net this simple rule-based neural net
5159280	5164800	it pretty much does it and so you can and in fact what's happened in neuroscience for instances
5164800	5169440	back in the day my my friends in neuroscience always said well we got these neural nets
5169440	5173840	but they're not really models of brains they're really some idealization that may be useful for
5173840	5178880	technology etc etc etc now that neural nets clearly do things that are very brain-like
5178880	5184880	that that that narrative has reversed and now it's a question of well you know we've got we
5184880	5189920	know what the core mechanisms are now let's see how we map those into what we can see biologically
5192160	5198880	is your question quick all right so I don't know if you have a mic but you can I'll repeat your
5198880	5216400	question just stated for example if we want to learn new interesting structures how can we use
5216400	5221920	AI to discover them without you know doing simulation and then looking for patterns in those
5221920	5227280	can we actually use it to find out yeah that's a good question right so the question is using AI
5227280	5231920	go ahead yeah you know can AI solve science this is a there's a very current question
5231920	5238240	and that's not a short question but anyway actually we have a project right now that is
5238800	5244640	you know day by day is is making progress on this question so here's here's what we seem to be finding
5244640	5250960	not not this this thing hasn't fully landed yet so I don't know the full story but so a question is
5250960	5255360	what can you predict with another lamp what can another lamp predict I show it pictures of cellular
5255360	5260160	automata things like this can it you know can it just say this is what's going to happen
5260160	5266560	can it to what extent can it at least find the pockets of reducibility we don't know fully the
5266560	5270560	answer to this but there's clearly a boundary we can see there are cases where it just doesn't work
5270560	5275920	and there are cases where it definitely does work and so the you know this question of can it notice
5275920	5280960	patterns that we haven't noticed so in protein folding for example there's been a fair degree
5280960	5285920	of success a little bit less success perhaps than people sometimes imagine but there's been
5285920	5290720	some success in taking I mean when you if you feed a random sequence of amino acids and say how
5290720	5296000	does this fold the answer probably won't be right but in things that are at least somewhat close to
5296000	5300400	proteins that have already been but whose structure is already known there's there's a lot that can
5300400	5306640	be said and the question is why does that work and the general belief is that it works because
5306640	5312160	there are aspects of protein structure which are features that we humans have not noticed
5312720	5319440	that the that the system noticed okay and and so this idea that it's noticing things that we didn't
5319440	5324480	notice is is going to be a very common thing I mean even even an image identifier that's telling
5324480	5330080	cats from dogs how does it tell cats from dogs well it's found some feature of those pictures
5330080	5334480	maybe it's the pointiness of the ears or something it's found some feature that allows it to make
5334480	5339440	that distinction we don't you know that's not necessarily a feature that we know about it's
5339440	5344320	also very hard for us to tell what feature it found because we don't have a way to kind of
5344320	5350800	go inside its mind and convert its way of thinking about things to our ways of thinking about things
5350800	5357440	so you know in terms of of what can we learn about science so first question is can the LLM
5357440	5362320	when there is some sort of feature that allows prediction to happen can the LLM find that and
5362320	5366880	be able to make predictions my guess is that that will be generally somewhat successful
5366880	5373440	but I think computational irreducibility is kind of a big sort of you know it's a big monster
5374400	5378320	at the gates there that will prevent certain kinds of things from from being possible but
5378320	5384560	some things where a human could go and find these these rules yes the LLM might be able to do that
5384560	5392800	more efficiently more automatically first point so second point is um in well another point is
5392800	5397840	can the LLM invent something that is a way of explaining to us humans how something works
5398480	5406240	that's essentially the problem of the AI tutor can the can the system learn enough about us humans
5406240	5411840	that it can give us an explanation that is useful for us as humans and my guess is there'll be some
5411840	5416560	success in that in other words if I want to learn some new thing you know how difficult is it to
5416560	5422720	learn something well you know if I had an AI that knows everything I know for me personally I happen
5422720	5429600	to be a enthusiast of personal data so there's 50 million words that I've said or written that are
5429600	5437520	out there so I can train an LLM to be a pretty good you know simulation of me and given that what
5438080	5444320	you know if I then if I know if the LLM knows or the AI knows what I know and then I say well
5444320	5450080	I'm today I'm trying to learn about macroeconomics you know I want to you know how do I understand
5450080	5455360	this there's a reasonable chance that the LLM is going to say well you can relate that to this thing
5455360	5460400	you know and that thing you know and I have a much easier path to be able to learn those things
5460400	5465600	it's another thing another thing to say about about what LLMs potentially do one of the
5465600	5470960	interesting things that LLMs do is they essentially do what one might call sort of a generalization
5470960	5475520	of statistics that relates to text so normally you know you have a bunch of numbers you say what's
5475520	5479920	the mean what's the variance of these numbers these kinds of numerical sorts of things but if you've
5479920	5487920	just got a big lump of text and you say what was the most popular hat style in the 1950s that's a
5487920	5492480	textual question and that's a question where there's not you know turning that into numbers
5492480	5498480	is not so easy but LLMs can actually go purely at the textual level and answer a question like that
5498480	5503920	and so there's this pure sort of textual statistics you might call it it's not really statistics in
5503920	5509280	the ordinary sense of numbers it's some new kind of thing that can be sort of deduced textually
5509280	5514320	and I think the the other one thing that will happen is there are these you know one way that
5514320	5519440	science advances is through these kind of analogies between one field and another to notice that oh
5519520	5524160	what happens in metamathematics is like what happens in general activity well that's something
5524160	5527760	that you know I'm very proud of being able to notice that as a human because I know something
5527760	5531760	about those two fields and I can kind of connect them up but I suspect LLMs are going to be able
5531760	5535840	to figure those kinds of things out too because they're going to be able to see that the structure
5535840	5542320	just like they can they can kind of extract logic from just the patterns of sentences so they'll
5542320	5548560	extract principles from from kind of the noticing that these two different areas work the way they
5548560	5553840	work but I mean this question of can the LLM invent a formalism that is useful for us humans
5553840	5558000	that's a that's an interesting good question I'll tell you one little micro data point so you know
5558000	5562880	I spend a lot of my life doing computational language design and you know we quite often
5562880	5567520	livestream these things and so on but one of the things that's new in the version of
5567520	5571680	Wolfman language it's just about to come out is there are new functions that are in there
5571680	5578080	that were suggested by an LLM so in other words the LLM has looked at all this code it knows what's
5578080	5583360	people are asking about it's seen what's out there on the web it said oh there's a function
5583360	5588400	you should have a function called digit sum and I think it even suggested that name and it's a
5588400	5593680	pretty good idea it's taken sort of the average of what people out there want and yes you can you
5593680	5600160	can digit sum is something that's a trivial kind of idiom in Wolfman language but it's noticed
5600160	5604960	that that's an idiom that's a repeated idiom and that's kind of the essence of language design
5604960	5609360	and so we're able to take that suggestion from LLM by the way in terms of how LLMs will be used
5609360	5614160	compiling the wisdom of the crowds basically yes yes into I mean what one thing to say about how
5614160	5619680	LLMs will be used I have a feeling one of the big uses of LLMs will be offline uses people are a
5619680	5624640	lot of constant people are concentrating on I've got an LLM in the loop and I'm typing something
5624640	5630240	and an LLM is responding to that for example for our purposes when we do data curation LLMs have
5630240	5637120	basically speeded up many parts of our data curation pipeline by a matter of two not a hundred
5637120	5642880	but two and two is worth having but it's not um but I think that these these offline uses where
5642880	5648880	you use the wisdom of the LLM and then you burn it into a piece of technology that's going to be a
5648880	5654800	an important thing given given that we'll well over time and before we I'm very bad at short
5654800	5660640	answers I apologize I'll ask you one last question given your amazing optimism about
5660640	5666480	the capabilities of LLMs now and you alluded to some of this in in your talk many have claimed
5666480	5676720	that AI poses a future existential threat to humanity others disagree vehemently what's your
5676720	5683680	view on this and what do you think are kind of the main AI threats of today but let's let's talk
5683680	5689360	about the existence yeah yeah right I mean okay so you know more and more things in the world will
5689360	5695840	be delegated to AIs that's just just as a matter of convenience because things have to happen quickly
5695840	5701920	you know it's we're going to delegate stuff to AIs and then the question is okay so you know
5702480	5707280	does something terrible happen as a result of that the thing to understand is there's all
5707280	5712160	this stuff going on in the in the world of the AIs and the kind of underworld of the AIs the world
5712240	5716800	is being run by AIs let's say and we say well we don't understand what these AIs are doing that's
5716800	5722000	terrible how can we possibly exist in a situation where the world is being run by forces we don't
5722000	5727040	understand actually we've been there before because that's the situation we're in with nature
5727040	5732880	nature is doing a lot of stuff we don't understand and we have managed to find ways to exist we find
5732880	5740160	found niches where we can sort of carve out our existence you know within nature and it works just
5740160	5745280	fine I mean occasionally bad things happen you know hurricanes develop and bad things happen
5745280	5750960	and we don't understand quite why those happen and you know we gradually maybe can do a science of
5751520	5756480	you know the atmosphere or something and figure that out with AIs the same is going to happen
5756480	5760480	there's going to be lots of stuff that goes on and mostly it's going to be just fine and we
5760480	5764640	understand how to live in that niche and occasionally some crazy thing will happen
5764640	5769280	and we'll say we better build more science that allows us to understand sort of what's happening
5769280	5775200	in the underworld of the AIs so to speak so the first thing to say another thing to say is well is
5775200	5779360	there going to be anything for the humans anything left for the humans to do or we have automated
5779360	5785600	everything it's by definition we will not automate everything because a lot of what has to be done
5785600	5791520	is to figure out what we want to do and there is no sort of intrinsic way that the AI does that now
5791520	5796560	there's a practical matter I looked at the last 150 years or so of what what people have done as
5796560	5802160	occupations so to speak and here's what you see in you know in the 150 years ago agriculture was the
5802160	5810480	biggest chunk of sort of US occupations and then it got automated and so that chunk shrunk and you
5810480	5814320	see the same thing happening over and what happened to that chunk what happened to those people well
5814320	5818960	the answer is they went into lots of different occupations many of which were enabled by the
5818960	5824160	automation of agriculture and the same thing has happened over and over again that's something that
5824160	5830080	takes a lot of people to do it it ends up getting automated that thing goes to almost zero people
5830080	5835840	but those that the the very automation of that thing enables a bunch of new capabilities
5835840	5841120	which then provide a more fragmented kind of story and it's a pretty common thing you see in
5841120	5845600	in economies around the world more developed economies are more fragmented in terms of the
5845600	5851840	occupations people do and that's that seems to be you know as as you automate more you and what's
5851840	5857040	really happening there what's really happening there is the fragmented occupations are sort of
5857040	5863200	the frontiers where it's still like what are we going to do in this area and that's something that
5863200	5868160	takes humans and it's just like you know right now it's kind of fun to see the new occupations I'm
5868160	5874080	always I you know at a company I I often am entertained by the fact that I'll invent some
5874080	5879120	new job category of a thing that people have never heard of before like LLM scientist or
5879200	5886560	or you know AI psychologist or you know prompt engineer or prompt magician yes yes right exactly
5886560	5890240	and these are things that you know it's gosh those have never been and by the way prompt
5890240	5894800	engineering is a great use for the you know people say well you're going to be computer
5894800	5899120	programmer you're going to do stem type stuff the best prompt engineers are the best expository
5899120	5906480	writers so it's a different skill set that and that happens because the LLMs were trained on
5906480	5910800	you know the LLMs understand just like other humans understand and so it's sort of not surprising
5910800	5915920	that it's expository writing that turns out to be the important skill there so by the way the
5915920	5920560	combination of expository writing and computation is writing good computational language that that
5920560	5926400	in itself is another occupational area is is computation editors so to speak who can turn
5926400	5930720	bad computational language into good computational language and so on there are there are just these
5930720	5936960	many different opportunities that that get opened up so I'm you know I think us humans you know
5936960	5941360	it's worth realizing if you look at the sort of long arc of history and you say what do people do
5941360	5946240	a thousand years ago what do we do what do people even think was worth doing a thousand years ago
5946240	5951280	and then what do we do now many of the things we do today didn't look like they were worth doing a
5951280	5956240	thousand years ago I mean you know I walk on a treadmill why do you do that it's you know what
5956240	5962560	a crazy thing to do it's it so you know I think that's what we'll see and one of the things that's
5962560	5967760	funny about understanding history in the future and so on is that you might say oh you know everybody's
5967760	5972320	just going to be playing video games that's a terrible outcome looks to be a terrible outcome to me
5972320	5979840	right now from from my viewpoint and you know the you know in 2023 or whatever but it's you know to
5979840	5985840	the internal impression of the humans so to speak may be a very different story in terms of
5986320	5991920	of you know what will happen in terms of of sort of when the ai's run central banks when the ai's
5991920	5997600	do all these kinds of things and and many of those things will happen and and at a practical level
5997600	6004400	there's a question of what can you do with this how can we make the ai's do things we want to have
6004400	6008560	them do and not do the things we don't want to have them do so first question is well what do we
6008560	6014400	want to have them do and so you know I've thought a bit I will say this is a for me it's it's an
6014400	6020080	unfinished question I mean this first question is okay you're making constitution for the world
6020080	6024400	for a country let's say hopefully not for the whole world hopefully for individual countries
6024400	6031040	you're making constitution in modern times you've got ai's what do you what are the provisions for
6031040	6037120	example can an ai own things does an ai have to have an owner you know how do you decide what to
6037120	6041520	do do you have a democracy where people vote and and check boxes or do you have a prompt
6041520	6046400	autocracy where everybody writes you know a prompt and it gets fed into an ai and the ai
6046400	6051440	kind of decides what to do what do you do how do you think about what's possible and first question
6051440	6057600	is what you know is there a you know what do people want and the answer is obviously not everybody
6057600	6062720	is going to want the same thing and that's you know so the idea that you know there's the global
6062720	6070720	view this is this is a very bad idea I mean this is you know this is you know this this won't work
6071360	6078720	just as you know it hasn't just not a not a thing that that works in the way that humans who believe
6078720	6084720	in free will and things like that set the world up but so so first point is I think that you know
6084720	6089440	I've thought quite a bit about this kind of ai constitution question and what sorts of provisions
6089440	6095680	you might imagine in wanting to set up it's not easy to understand how those constraints get applied
6095680	6100320	etc etc etc and certainly there's not going to be one kind of this is the ai constitution of the
6100320	6105760	world we're finished type thing um but even figuring out those provisions is surprisingly hard
6105760	6110800	and and I've I've you know it's surprisingly little has been done on this second thing the thing
6110800	6115680	that I've now come to think more about because I think it's it's a more promising direction
6116400	6121680	is if one ai if there's just one ai in the world I think it's a very brittle situation
6122240	6126960	the reality is there's not going to be one ai in the world there's going to be a whole society of ai's
6126960	6132080	and the society of ai's will operate in some way that probably has many of the same dynamics as human
6132080	6137840	society and the society there will be some inexorable features of the ai society just as
6137840	6142480	presumably there are inexorable features of human society and economics and things like this
6142480	6147360	so there's a science question about what are those inexorable features what does the society of the
6147360	6152480	ai's look like and how do we you know are there dynamics for the society of ai let me give you
6152480	6157920	one example it's unthought out okay so but let me make a meta comment the meta comment is if you
6157920	6163200	look at the history of things like governance and democracy and so on you know big things happened
6163200	6167520	a few hundred years ago that was a time when there was a lot of political philosophy was being thought
6167520	6172480	about and people figured stuff out in political philosophy and that turned into actual governance
6172480	6178400	systems that have been reasonably successful over the last few hundred years and you know now is the
6178400	6184480	moment this is the great moment for political philosophy again it's you know and I don't know
6184480	6189520	that there are very many people who've stepped up to figuring this out but there will be ideas
6189520	6194560	that will be and they won't be promptocracies probably but it'll be something and there'll be
6194560	6201040	ideas that are different new ideas enabled by the fact that we live in an ai technological
6201040	6206160	society so to speak that that become possible I'll give you one example of a kind of thinking
6206160	6211680	and we will end on that example okay fine now maybe this is a this is maybe not an upper okay so
6211680	6220400	here's the question question is in human society people sort of to some sense do the right thing
6220400	6226480	because if they don't do the right thing they suffer for ai's that's a more complicated issue
6226480	6233440	because so far as we know ai's don't suffer so how do you get an ai to do the right thing if it
6233440	6239520	won't suffer by doing the wrong thing and and so but now what you realize is actually you already
6239520	6245840	have this issue with humans because you know internally to you how you feel but anything else
6245920	6251520	is an extrapolation it's just you're guessing that you have empathy for some other thing so okay
6251520	6257040	so you can you start thinking about the ai's and what is the operational again I'd say I haven't
6257040	6261200	figured this out but I just I give this as an example of the type of thinking I think one has to do
6261920	6270000	is is you know if there's an ai and it did the wrong thing and it is then removed from ai society
6270160	6278160	okay whether the ai internally suffered or not who cares because what matters to the world is that
6278160	6283440	it was removed from ai society so to speak and so what you realize is that that this kind of the
6283440	6289280	societal you know is there a dynamics of that society that causes the ai that did the wrong
6289280	6295200	thing to not be trusted by the other ai's etc etc etc that be to be sort of removed from ai society
6295200	6301440	having no kind of imagined not imagining that you are you know the ai itself is making this you
6301440	6307280	know making this decision it's as I say not properly thought out but that's just as a
6307280	6312320	for people interested in philosophy of these things that's just sort of a you know the beginnings
6312320	6317840	of a thought about how to think through you know sort of responsibility personal responsibility
6317840	6323440	in the time of ai interesting okay with that please join me in thanking Stephen for this
6324000	6331200	extra long edition of our distinguished lecture thank you thank you everyone and see you next
6331200	6334400	semester with the distinguished lecture series
