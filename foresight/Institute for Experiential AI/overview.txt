1. **AI Constitution & Governance**: The idea of an AI constitution is complex, and while there have been some thoughts on what provisions might include, there's surprisingly little work done in this area. It's challenging to imagine how constraints would be applied to AI systems, and it's unlikely that there will be a single global AI constitution.

2. **Society of AIs**: The future will likely involve multiple AI systems interacting within their own society, which may exhibit dynamics similar to human societies. There is a science question about what these inexorable features of an AI society might look like.

3. **Historical Precedence**: We are at a historical moment where political philosophy is as important as it was centuries ago when modern governance and democratic systems were being established. New ideas, particularly those enabled by AI technology, will emerge to govern this new age.

4. **AI's and Suffering**: A key challenge in AI ethics is that unlike humans, AIs do not suffer physically or emotionally. Therefore, the concept of an AI doing the "right thing" because it would suffer for doing wrong is not applicable. This raises questions about how to ensure AIs behave ethically within their society without the assumption of internal suffering.

5. **Societal Dynamics for AIs**: Stephen's example suggests that in an AI society, an AI that performs an action deemed wrong could be "removed from AI society," not because it suffers but because its actions are socially unacceptable within the AI community. The dynamics of this society would likely lead to self-regulation and a form of trustworthiness or reputation among AIs.

6. **Philosophical Considerations**: The discussion highlights the need for further philosophical thought on how to ensure personal responsibility and ethical behavior in an AI-dominated world, emphasizing that these are areas ripe for exploration and innovation.

In conclusion, the lecture underscored the importance of considering the governance and societal dynamics of AI systems, as well as the need for new philosophical frameworks to address these complex issues. It also serves as a call to action for thinkers and doers to shape the future of AI ethics and governance.

1. **Impact and Control of Large Language Models**: The discussion centered around the impact and control of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and their successors. The positive potential of these models to augment human intelligence and trigger a renaissance similar to past technological advancements like the printing press or the internet was highlighted. However, concerns about misuse, disinformation, and ethical considerations were also acknowledged.

2. **Access and Openness**: It was emphasized that access to AI systems should be as wide as possible, allowing diverse groups of people to leverage their benefits. The importance of developing countermeasures for the adverse effects was stressed.

3. **Countermeasures**: Ensuring that these models do not propagate lies or act under the control of malicious actors is crucial. This involves creating mechanisms for verifying information and preventing misuse.

4. **Ethical Responsibility**: There is a responsibility to make these models as safe, factual, and beneficial as possible, which includes addressing issues like bias, fairness, and transparency.

5. **Optimism for the Future**: The overall sentiment was optimistic regarding the potential of AI to enhance human capabilities and contribute to a bright future for humanity, encouraging widespread access and use.

6. **Closing Remarks**: Jan concluded by expressing gratitude for the session and highlighted the importance of planning, both in the context of this discussion and in the broader scope of AI development and deployment. The session ended with a call to action to address the challenges and harness the potential of AI responsibly.
