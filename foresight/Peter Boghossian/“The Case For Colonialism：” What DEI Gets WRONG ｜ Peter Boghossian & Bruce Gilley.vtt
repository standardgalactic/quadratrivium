WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
But just imagine how pernicious a myth that is of,

00:06.440 --> 00:08.440
because it often gets raised in this debate, right?

00:08.440 --> 00:10.160
Well, what about the Congo?

00:10.160 --> 00:11.000
Yeah.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.280
You know, wasn't the Congo terrible?

00:12.280 --> 00:13.120
That's what I was thinking.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.480
Yeah, no, it wasn't, actually.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.320
It was amazingly positive.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.680
Black Lives Mattered to King Leopold,

00:18.680 --> 00:21.980
and he did an amazing thing to support them.

00:22.420 --> 00:26.700
Welcome to Conversations with Peter Burgosian.

00:26.700 --> 00:29.620
Today we will have a conversation with Dr. Bruce Gilley.

00:29.620 --> 00:32.020
He's a professor at Portland State University.

00:32.020 --> 00:33.820
I hope you enjoy the conversation.

00:33.820 --> 00:34.660
Thank you.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.900
Dr. Bruce Gilley, it is an honor to talk to you today.

00:37.900 --> 00:40.380
We're going to talk about your fantastic new book,

00:40.380 --> 00:42.060
The Case for Colonialism.

00:42.060 --> 00:43.380
But before we do that,

00:43.380 --> 00:45.980
we have a lot of other things to talk about.

00:45.980 --> 00:49.060
You are now the most hated man in Portland State University.

00:49.700 --> 00:52.020
Oh, no, that's undervaluing my hatred.

00:52.020 --> 00:54.220
I think I'm the most hated man

00:54.220 --> 00:56.580
in the Western United States, at least.

00:57.580 --> 01:00.780
So people are very upset with you,

01:00.780 --> 01:02.140
and I remember you were very kind,

01:02.140 --> 01:04.380
and you took a lot of time to explain,

01:04.380 --> 01:05.740
so we went out to lunch,

01:05.740 --> 01:08.140
and you took time to explain to my son and I

01:08.140 --> 01:11.700
about colonialism, and I definitely want to talk about that.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.140
But before we talk about that,

01:13.140 --> 01:14.180
we have some,

01:14.220 --> 01:16.060
issues of the day that we need to talk about,

01:16.060 --> 01:19.300
specifically the plagiarism scandal.

01:19.300 --> 01:21.500
So before I go into it,

01:21.500 --> 01:23.260
do you have any brief thoughts on it,

01:23.260 --> 01:26.900
the caught-in-gay and DEI plagiarism scandals?

01:26.900 --> 01:30.740
Well, I think it ultimately all comes back to the same thing,

01:30.740 --> 01:33.660
which is higher education,

01:33.660 --> 01:36.620
maybe general intellectual life as a whole,

01:36.620 --> 01:38.620
has always been political, right?

01:38.620 --> 01:41.260
So you say that there's a lot of political issues

01:41.260 --> 01:42.580
that are going to be raised,

01:42.580 --> 01:43.740
but it's always been political, right?

01:43.740 --> 01:45.180
So you say that this art's political,

01:45.180 --> 01:47.700
or that writing that guy's book is political, fine.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.500
It's always been political in some sense.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.780
You can have standards of logic or evidence and stuff,

01:52.780 --> 01:54.660
but saying that someone's political.

01:54.660 --> 01:55.900
But I think what happened,

01:55.900 --> 01:59.220
which people only now realize really,

01:59.220 --> 02:02.380
is some of these fields, if not all of them,

02:02.380 --> 02:05.980
especially the studies fields, stopped being political.

02:05.980 --> 02:07.660
Political meaning a situation

02:07.660 --> 02:09.620
where people can have different points of view,

02:09.620 --> 02:11.660
even though they take points of view,

02:11.700 --> 02:13.340
and they became totalitarian.

02:13.340 --> 02:14.180
Correct.

02:14.180 --> 02:17.380
Which means there is no possibility

02:17.380 --> 02:19.740
of having more than one point of view.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.820
Once a field becomes totalitarian,

02:21.820 --> 02:24.900
i.e. once it loses the debate

02:24.900 --> 02:27.780
that marks a political situation,

02:27.780 --> 02:30.060
thinking itself becomes degraded,

02:30.060 --> 02:33.420
because why would you try and think different thoughts?

02:33.420 --> 02:37.100
Your whole job is to find a script and to follow it,

02:37.100 --> 02:38.980
and the logical conclusion of that

02:38.980 --> 02:43.940
is to actually start to recite it, to repeat it.

02:43.940 --> 02:45.580
Like Marxist ideological training.

02:45.580 --> 02:48.540
To plagiarize it, but it's not plagiarism,

02:48.540 --> 02:51.420
because as a good party member,

02:51.420 --> 02:53.980
you're repeating the mantras of the master.

02:53.980 --> 02:56.740
You are citing the key phrases.

02:56.740 --> 02:59.940
You are showing how history all can be understood

02:59.940 --> 03:01.900
through this master narrative,

03:01.900 --> 03:04.700
which in the case of the DEI, or the Black Studies people,

03:04.700 --> 03:06.980
is the oppression of black people in structural racism.

03:06.980 --> 03:07.820
We know that.

03:08.660 --> 03:11.100
In some ways, people having this kind of

03:11.100 --> 03:12.940
neo-victorian response,

03:12.940 --> 03:17.380
oh dear, plagiarism is silly,

03:17.380 --> 03:19.700
because of course she plagiarizes,

03:19.700 --> 03:22.980
because plagiarism is all about a totalitarian mindset

03:22.980 --> 03:25.740
of following the master and repeating the mantras

03:25.740 --> 03:27.540
and adhering to the principles.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.380
That's so interesting.

03:28.380 --> 03:30.340
And we should have known all along

03:30.340 --> 03:35.180
that these DEI diversity recruits and appointments

03:35.180 --> 03:36.860
were gonna be full of plagiarism,

03:36.860 --> 03:39.180
because in a communist or a totalitarian mindset,

03:39.180 --> 03:40.500
that's not called plagiarism.

03:40.500 --> 03:41.940
It's called towing the line.

03:41.940 --> 03:43.180
That's so interesting.

03:43.180 --> 03:47.180
I never thought about it from that perspective before.

03:48.180 --> 03:51.540
So by the time we release this,

03:53.060 --> 03:56.100
and I'm confident that I can say this now,

03:56.100 --> 03:58.500
we have found many people who have plagiarized

03:58.500 --> 03:59.940
at the highest levels.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.020
So that doesn't surprise you.

04:02.020 --> 04:05.460
Of course you have, and it's the tip of the iceberg.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.540
And once we start running these papers

04:08.540 --> 04:11.220
they've submitted and published through the fact checker,

04:11.220 --> 04:16.220
the plagiarizer, the AI enhanced plagiarism detector,

04:16.300 --> 04:18.700
we're gonna see, just as if I had taken

04:18.700 --> 04:21.060
a bunch of papers from Marxist in China

04:21.060 --> 04:22.700
and run them through the plagiarism checker,

04:22.700 --> 04:25.380
of course I'd find all they do is plagiarize

04:25.380 --> 04:27.900
their mentors, their party leaders,

04:27.900 --> 04:30.420
the great leaders, the great speeches, right?

04:30.420 --> 04:32.740
Because that's what totalitarianism does,

04:32.740 --> 04:34.220
is it creates a script.

04:34.220 --> 04:37.100
And you're expected to memorize it and repeat it.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.780
It's not called plagiarism.

04:38.780 --> 04:41.340
And so to say a charge of plagiarism

04:41.340 --> 04:43.540
against someone like Claudine Gaye

04:43.540 --> 04:45.460
is rather like charging a party member

04:45.460 --> 04:47.420
in the Soviet Union of quoting Marx.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.140
Of course I quoted Marx.

04:49.140 --> 04:51.020
I did it as much as possible.

04:51.020 --> 04:52.260
It's not plagiarism.

04:52.260 --> 04:54.300
I just learned the lingo and the phrase.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.140
So let me ask you a question.

04:56.140 --> 05:00.300
I cannot, I sincerely cannot for the life of me figure it out.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.300
Maybe you can help me figure this out.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.900
Okay, so she kept her salary of $900,000 a year

05:07.900 --> 05:09.380
and it's a private institution.

05:09.380 --> 05:11.340
They do take federal funding though,

05:11.340 --> 05:12.420
but it's a private institution.

05:12.420 --> 05:13.740
Do you do anything you want as a private institution?

05:13.740 --> 05:14.780
You want to double her salary?

05:14.780 --> 05:15.980
That's your business.

05:15.980 --> 05:17.500
It's none of my concern.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.580
But and she's now faculty.

05:19.580 --> 05:22.660
So she's back in her faculty.

05:22.660 --> 05:24.220
She's been removed from the administration.

05:24.220 --> 05:27.220
So you need to please help me understand two things.

05:27.220 --> 05:29.620
And I'm very sincere when I say this.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.860
Why isn't she kicked out of the university?

05:31.860 --> 05:35.860
But even more so when your paper came out

05:35.860 --> 05:36.780
in Third World Quarterly,

05:36.780 --> 05:38.500
people, there was a petition I remember

05:38.500 --> 05:41.860
that went around saying that they wanted your PhD.

05:41.860 --> 05:42.700
Revoked.

05:42.700 --> 05:43.540
Revoked.

05:43.540 --> 05:46.900
They wanted your PhD for an article

05:46.900 --> 05:49.900
that you made an argument for a position.

05:49.900 --> 05:54.340
Like, and people are of course free to disagree.

05:54.340 --> 05:55.580
That's what we, that's what,

05:55.580 --> 05:57.180
that's the whole structure that we've said.

05:57.180 --> 05:58.140
That's the coin of the realm.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.900
Disagreement, publishing and that's great.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.380
Fine, wonderful, fantastic.

06:01.380 --> 06:03.580
But they wanted your PhD from that.

06:03.580 --> 06:07.340
But this woman is a serial plagiarist.

06:07.340 --> 06:09.140
We know that for a fact.

06:09.140 --> 06:12.060
So please help me explain one,

06:12.060 --> 06:13.940
why she is still faculty.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.660
And two, why hasn't she,

06:15.660 --> 06:17.980
why is her PhD not revoked?

06:17.980 --> 06:20.740
Because she's part of the people.

06:20.740 --> 06:23.380
The people, the communists used to call those

06:23.380 --> 06:25.140
who told the party line

06:25.140 --> 06:27.100
and were good members of society or the party,

06:27.100 --> 06:29.620
the people, i.e. they're on the inside.

06:29.620 --> 06:34.620
And even though reactionary forces may take them down,

06:34.780 --> 06:36.020
they're still part of the people.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.620
So of course they're their kid.

06:37.620 --> 06:40.180
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if they promote her

06:40.180 --> 06:41.500
in the Department of African Studies

06:41.500 --> 06:44.620
because she's done exactly what she should do.

06:44.620 --> 06:48.540
She's used her color to seize power.

06:48.540 --> 06:50.060
She's then used her power

06:50.060 --> 06:53.540
to promote the totalitarian ideology of DEI.

06:53.540 --> 06:57.460
And then when she's been found to have copied

06:57.460 --> 07:02.460
and repeated and propagated the ideology of the masters

07:02.500 --> 07:04.560
and ousted by reactionary forces,

07:04.560 --> 07:07.860
she has gone down saying, I'm a victim of racism.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.760
So not only is she back in place,

07:11.760 --> 07:13.420
she should be given a raise.

07:13.420 --> 07:15.380
She should be promoted.

07:15.380 --> 07:17.980
She is the most loyal party cadre

07:17.980 --> 07:20.820
to the cause of DEI and wokeness

07:20.820 --> 07:22.540
that Harvard has ever seen.

07:22.540 --> 07:25.420
So, you know, this surprise to me

07:25.420 --> 07:27.420
is they haven't yet announced a salary raise

07:27.420 --> 07:30.540
or an endowed chair for her in African Studies

07:30.540 --> 07:34.300
because she is the model of the good party hack.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.060
Now, I'm exactly the opposite, right?

07:36.060 --> 07:37.420
I'm the white Russian.

07:37.420 --> 07:38.260
I'm the white Russian.

07:38.260 --> 07:39.540
I am the reactionary.

07:39.540 --> 07:40.860
I'm outside of the people.

07:40.860 --> 07:44.940
So when I do something that causes controversy,

07:44.940 --> 07:47.620
which isn't actually plagiarism or calling for genocide,

07:47.620 --> 07:49.100
but it's just part of an article,

07:49.100 --> 07:53.780
of course the reaction to me is, well, that's the gulag for him.

07:53.780 --> 07:56.860
You know, revoke his PhD, cancel his article.

07:56.860 --> 07:58.700
If he shows up at any conferences,

07:58.700 --> 08:01.060
this was Hamad Dabishi at Columbia University,

08:01.060 --> 08:02.100
we should attack him.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.220
We should mob him.

08:03.220 --> 08:04.300
We should silence him.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.820
We should snub him.

08:05.820 --> 08:06.660
Because that's all they have.

08:06.660 --> 08:10.100
Then we get my faculty union at Portland State saying,

08:10.100 --> 08:11.820
I should be stripped of academic freedom

08:11.820 --> 08:13.820
and stripped of my faculty position

08:13.820 --> 08:16.700
because my research is outside

08:16.700 --> 08:20.100
of the totalitarian ideology of anti-colonialism, right?

08:20.100 --> 08:24.320
So yeah, I mean, part of me is like, what do you expect, right?

08:24.320 --> 08:27.260
And people like you have been studying

08:27.260 --> 08:31.040
the totalitarian mindset of DEI and Wokeness for so long.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.400
We shouldn't be surprised when its response

08:33.400 --> 08:36.680
to a liberal critique is racists, reactionaries.

08:36.680 --> 08:38.640
No, that's not what surprises me.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.840
But what surprises me is that,

08:40.840 --> 08:44.600
isn't there a universal rule set?

08:44.600 --> 08:46.960
I mean, there was up until very, very recently,

08:46.960 --> 08:48.920
maybe, I can't give you an exact date,

08:48.920 --> 08:51.080
but maybe 2010, I'm guessing,

08:51.080 --> 08:55.040
that if somebody plagiarized a dissertation,

08:55.040 --> 08:57.640
and I think it would probably suit me well

08:57.640 --> 09:00.360
to have names of people who they've caught in the past

09:00.360 --> 09:04.920
who have plagiarized and then they lost their PhDs,

09:04.920 --> 09:08.200
is it that if you adhere to one particular orthodoxy,

09:08.200 --> 09:09.840
I mean, okay, so, Braggman,

09:11.680 --> 09:13.560
isn't there just some kind of a rule

09:13.560 --> 09:18.080
that if you plagiarize, there's no rule to that?

09:18.080 --> 09:21.000
I mean, come on, look at how many,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.920
what we thought were foundations of higher education

09:23.920 --> 09:26.760
collapsed in the last five years.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.800
You know, the idea of a student code of conduct

09:29.800 --> 09:33.400
at Princeton, which included don't plagiarize,

09:33.400 --> 09:37.560
was attacked and taken down by the Black Student Union

09:37.560 --> 09:39.560
because they said plagiarism's okay.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.560
This was long before Claudine Gay.

09:41.560 --> 09:44.880
The leading lights of African-American society

09:44.880 --> 09:47.240
who have been carefully selected and curated

09:47.240 --> 09:50.480
to go to Princeton were rallying on campus

09:50.480 --> 09:54.320
to say, cheating, plagiarizing, faking your grades,

09:54.320 --> 09:57.080
stealing papers, buying papers is okay,

09:57.080 --> 09:59.080
because otherwise we're just replicating

09:59.080 --> 10:01.320
the prison to pipeline, you know,

10:01.320 --> 10:04.280
the campus school to prison pipeline.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.440
So we knew those foundations were crumbling.

10:07.400 --> 10:10.360
Mandatory SAT scores to enter, gone.

10:11.860 --> 10:15.400
Mandatory requirements to pass or reach a certain standard

10:15.400 --> 10:17.720
to get a high school degree, gone, right?

10:17.720 --> 10:20.800
So plagiarism, not okay, gone, right?

10:20.800 --> 10:24.600
So by the time Claudine Gay gets into this controversy,

10:24.600 --> 10:26.520
we have these two worlds, right?

10:26.520 --> 10:29.860
We have the old liberal world of academic standards

10:29.860 --> 10:32.280
that you and I live in, but we don't realize

10:32.280 --> 10:35.160
how far the other side has drifted away from this.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.240
And it's not that we didn't plagiarize,

10:37.240 --> 10:39.720
it's of course we plagiarized and you pointing it out

10:39.720 --> 10:41.280
and saying there's something wrong with it is racist.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.360
That's exactly what the critique is,

10:43.360 --> 10:46.200
that there's something wrong with us for,

10:46.200 --> 10:48.880
so I think that that will go down

10:48.880 --> 10:50.360
among a certain group of people,

10:50.360 --> 10:54.760
like Mark Lamont Hill and his supporters and-

10:54.760 --> 10:55.600
Kendi.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.880
And Kendi.

10:56.880 --> 10:59.360
So just to be crystal clear about something

10:59.360 --> 11:00.720
that this is not about race,

11:00.720 --> 11:05.240
I'm telling you right with total sincerity,

11:05.240 --> 11:07.920
I'm running your dissertation through a plagiarism checker,

11:07.920 --> 11:10.080
and if you're found guilty of plagiarism,

11:10.080 --> 11:12.760
I'm gonna suggest that you lose your PhD revoked.

11:12.760 --> 11:13.100
Please do.

11:13.220 --> 11:16.140
And I would demand on our friendship

11:16.140 --> 11:17.380
that you would do the same to me.

11:17.380 --> 11:17.860
Absolutely.

11:17.860 --> 11:21.420
If my PhD dissertation, I can't remember what the name is,

11:21.420 --> 11:22.420
it's a critical-

11:22.420 --> 11:23.460
I can't remember the name of it.

11:23.460 --> 11:24.580
I can't remember what the name is,

11:24.580 --> 11:27.460
it's something like, it's been so long ago.

11:27.460 --> 11:29.260
But if that were found to have plagiarism,

11:29.260 --> 11:31.420
I would expect on the basis of our friendship

11:31.420 --> 11:33.180
that you would call for the revoking of my PhD.

11:33.180 --> 11:34.020
Absolutely.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.700
So that is a kind of integrity that is-

11:35.700 --> 11:37.780
Or anything you've published academically for that matter.

11:37.780 --> 11:38.540
Right, right.

11:38.540 --> 11:39.060
Us for me.

11:39.060 --> 11:41.060
No, no, for sure, for sure.

11:41.060 --> 11:43.140
Yeah, okay, so I'll broaden, yeah.

11:43.140 --> 11:47.980
So, that goes beyond the range of...

11:47.980 --> 11:50.140
That's just an integrity issue, right?

11:50.140 --> 11:52.140
So it doesn't have to do with our friendship.

11:52.140 --> 11:54.980
The fact that I'm your friend, that we're friends,

11:54.980 --> 11:56.780
should have absolutely nothing to do

11:56.780 --> 11:59.220
with the fact that you would be...

11:59.220 --> 12:01.820
That makes the plagiarism okay with you.

12:01.820 --> 12:04.220
The fact that we're white or male or sister,

12:04.220 --> 12:05.980
whatever we want to say, whatever phrase we want,

12:05.980 --> 12:09.020
it's totally independent from the fact that we violated

12:09.020 --> 12:12.260
the closest thing that there is to a sin in academia

12:12.260 --> 12:13.100
is plagiarism.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.780
Like that's the gold standard for bad.

12:14.780 --> 12:18.420
So it's independent of any attribute that we possess

12:18.420 --> 12:19.500
or of any relationship.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.020
Like this is deeper than that.

12:21.020 --> 12:22.420
Well, yes and no.

12:22.420 --> 12:25.500
I mean, of course, that's the way we would like

12:25.500 --> 12:28.940
American society to operate on the basis of equality

12:28.940 --> 12:32.100
and colorblind race neutrality and merit,

12:32.100 --> 12:33.540
but it doesn't, right?

12:33.540 --> 12:35.500
And the reason Claudine Gaye was hired

12:35.500 --> 12:37.060
was because she's a black woman.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.180
That's the only reason.

12:38.180 --> 12:39.860
I mean, not even close, right?

12:39.860 --> 12:42.300
It wasn't even like a tiebreaker consideration.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.860
With someone I say, okay, we have two excellent candidates.

12:44.860 --> 12:47.060
They both have amazing administrative,

12:47.060 --> 12:48.500
fundraising experience.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.980
They're incredibly well-renowned scholars,

12:50.980 --> 12:52.940
10 university-pressed books each.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.100
How are you gonna say that?

12:54.100 --> 12:57.180
Okay, and we haven't had a black woman

12:57.180 --> 13:00.420
and there's some discussion, it might be useful.

13:00.420 --> 13:01.260
Let's do it.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.580
Okay, a lot of us, even liberals would say,

13:03.580 --> 13:06.780
okay, in that situation where the candidates are close

13:06.780 --> 13:08.500
and it's just a tiebreaker.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.700
Yeah, fine.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.260
Not even close, right?

13:11.260 --> 13:14.540
She was hired only because she is a black woman, right?

13:14.540 --> 13:16.260
Her scholarship was so tawdry.

13:16.260 --> 13:17.100
I know, I read it.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.340
She wouldn't even get hired at Portland State.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.180
No, she wouldn't.

13:19.180 --> 13:20.020
Oh, that's a con.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.140
Oh, that's a low bloke.

13:21.140 --> 13:22.460
That's a low bloke.

13:22.460 --> 13:25.140
No, but I mean, no, no, because actually

13:25.140 --> 13:27.420
to get a 10-year job in a state university

13:27.420 --> 13:30.780
takes actually a decent amount of good scholarship these days,

13:30.780 --> 13:31.700
given the mismatch.

13:31.700 --> 13:33.100
She had 11 publications.

13:33.100 --> 13:35.140
I've read as many of those as I can access.

13:35.140 --> 13:36.860
I've read them in their entirety.

13:36.860 --> 13:40.940
I just read someone who analyzed her dissertation

13:40.940 --> 13:43.540
and it's exactly as one would expect,

13:43.540 --> 13:47.300
barring the plagiarism, sloppy invalid inferences,

13:47.300 --> 13:49.540
fallacious reasoning throughout.

13:49.540 --> 13:51.100
Word salad everywhere.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.180
Just nothing but word salad.

13:52.180 --> 13:53.340
Yeah, and she was lauded.

13:53.340 --> 13:55.140
She won all these prizes.

13:55.140 --> 13:58.580
The society has drifted so, we've lost our minds.

13:58.580 --> 14:01.060
We've drifted so far from merit.

14:01.060 --> 14:05.700
Now the institutions, the engines of knowledge

14:05.700 --> 14:08.820
production of the society are fundamentally compromised.

14:08.820 --> 14:10.500
Well, you could be pessimistic and say

14:10.500 --> 14:12.380
that the Harvard case or any of these cases

14:12.380 --> 14:15.460
shows that the academy is beyond saving.

14:15.460 --> 14:16.420
And that may be true.

14:16.420 --> 14:19.420
But don't forget, the great thing about free society

14:19.420 --> 14:20.980
or the saving grace of a free society

14:20.980 --> 14:23.300
is it can always reorganize elsewhere, right?

14:23.300 --> 14:27.340
It can always escape a toxic situation or organization

14:27.340 --> 14:29.020
and regroup in other ways.

14:29.060 --> 14:31.740
It's what happens to cities when they get bombed out

14:31.740 --> 14:34.380
like Portland did during the George Floyd summer of love.

14:34.380 --> 14:36.940
And suddenly all the growth and all the wealth

14:36.940 --> 14:41.620
and all the dynamism is now living outside of Portland, right?

14:41.620 --> 14:43.820
Maybe in the periphery, but outside of Portland.

14:43.820 --> 14:44.780
So that's OK.

14:44.780 --> 14:47.180
We've seen a little bit of that in the university space,

14:47.180 --> 14:49.100
not just with the new universities, which I don't think

14:49.100 --> 14:52.460
really have it, but universities that are maybe second tier

14:52.460 --> 14:54.460
that are attracting a lot better students,

14:54.460 --> 14:56.980
getting away from the woke universities.

14:57.020 --> 14:59.820
We see this also in research, right?

14:59.820 --> 15:02.700
Because, yeah, academic research in many fields

15:02.700 --> 15:05.860
like public policy may be a complete joke at this point

15:05.860 --> 15:06.900
from within the university.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.980
But that's why we have think tanks, right?

15:08.980 --> 15:11.660
We have think tanks who are now basically picking up

15:11.660 --> 15:14.380
the slack saying the things that need to be said.

15:14.380 --> 15:18.140
So I mean, and mainstream media, another example, right?

15:18.140 --> 15:21.460
Basically being hollowed out and now massive amounts

15:21.460 --> 15:24.340
of media reformulating, reorganizing itself

15:24.340 --> 15:26.500
on the outside of the mainstream

15:26.500 --> 15:30.340
since the mainstream has gone through a process of involution.

15:30.340 --> 15:33.580
OK, so let's just accept by fiat the argument

15:33.580 --> 15:34.980
that I'm going to give you is correct.

15:34.980 --> 15:36.660
And here's the argument.

15:36.660 --> 15:38.980
And I've actually made this prediction

15:38.980 --> 15:43.180
for the first 30 days, what we're going to see in.

15:43.180 --> 15:44.860
And I made this a travest.

15:44.860 --> 15:48.020
I think that this ideology, critical social justice,

15:48.020 --> 15:50.780
will be pushed into ill repute probably in five months.

15:50.780 --> 15:53.260
We already see it an expedited version.

15:53.260 --> 15:54.860
We see this happening now.

15:55.820 --> 15:58.420
But just accept that this is all going to happen.

15:58.420 --> 16:02.020
We are going to find that the rot, the plagiarism,

16:02.020 --> 16:05.900
is rampant among not only DEI bureaucrats.

16:05.900 --> 16:09.020
I think that there's a hierarchy of where you'll find it.

16:09.020 --> 16:13.740
But in the hard sciences, the STEM sciences,

16:13.740 --> 16:14.540
there'll be less so.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.140
Maybe there'll be methodological problems.

16:16.140 --> 16:19.540
But that's so labor intensive to find.

16:19.540 --> 16:21.140
We're not even going to talk about that.

16:21.140 --> 16:23.780
But in DEI and soft fields, you're

16:23.780 --> 16:26.180
going to find rampant plagiarism.

16:26.180 --> 16:29.420
OK, the universities are going to be pushed into ill repute.

16:29.420 --> 16:30.300
Or not ill repute.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.500
The ideology will be pushed into ill repute.

16:32.500 --> 16:35.420
The universities will further lose their legitimacy.

16:35.420 --> 16:39.060
And hopefully, the numbers of enrollment will plummet.

16:39.060 --> 16:44.660
So my question to you is, accepting that that's the case,

16:44.660 --> 16:48.460
what do you see as the outcome of that?

16:48.460 --> 16:50.060
Are there like University of Austin?

16:50.060 --> 16:52.460
Are there these new universities coming up?

16:53.020 --> 16:55.060
Or do the people just, you think there's

16:55.060 --> 16:57.900
going to be another sea shift, where you say, well,

16:57.900 --> 16:59.460
don't hire people from universities

16:59.460 --> 17:01.940
or go to Khan Academy and get a certificate?

17:01.940 --> 17:04.220
What do you see is going to happen?

17:04.220 --> 17:08.060
Remember, there's always a demand side for skills

17:08.060 --> 17:08.860
in the economy.

17:08.860 --> 17:13.940
And first of all, as you said, in sciences, those fields,

17:13.940 --> 17:16.060
despite the attempts of DEI and Wokeness,

17:16.060 --> 17:17.460
but they can't afford that.

17:17.460 --> 17:19.460
Because science and technology fields

17:19.460 --> 17:22.180
are changing so rapidly with computing

17:22.220 --> 17:25.220
and computer-assisted biology, physics, chemistry,

17:25.220 --> 17:26.420
engineering.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.820
These fields, they don't have time for this BS,

17:29.820 --> 17:32.780
even though we see it in medical schools a little bit.

17:32.780 --> 17:35.020
But not really, because even the medical field

17:35.020 --> 17:36.260
doesn't have time for this.

17:36.260 --> 17:40.940
Professional schools, engineering, dentistry,

17:40.940 --> 17:43.100
architecture, I mean, they planning.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.540
They need to get stuff taught.

17:45.540 --> 17:46.620
But we see it now, too.

17:46.620 --> 17:47.820
We see it in medicine.

17:47.820 --> 17:50.980
We do, but it's not at the core.

17:51.420 --> 17:54.300
It's not at the same degree as in the humanities.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.140
That's for sure.

17:55.140 --> 17:55.980
Right, right.

17:55.980 --> 17:59.500
And my guess is it will remain outside of the core

17:59.500 --> 18:02.300
of these fields because there's a simple supply

18:02.300 --> 18:04.500
and demand equation, which is employers

18:04.500 --> 18:06.620
who are expected to carry out highly risky

18:06.620 --> 18:09.060
and technically demanding skills

18:09.060 --> 18:12.580
require employees who can show they've graduated

18:12.580 --> 18:14.700
from programs and they will simply not hire you

18:14.700 --> 18:16.380
if you're not graduating from a program

18:16.380 --> 18:17.220
that's delivering the skills.

18:17.220 --> 18:19.580
And they'll know within days whether you were taught or not.

18:19.580 --> 18:22.300
So I think those areas are pretty safe.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.380
Humanities and social sciences is a total different area

18:24.380 --> 18:27.500
because ultimately the reason those degrees used

18:27.500 --> 18:30.220
to generate value added for the graduates

18:30.220 --> 18:31.540
was you could think.

18:31.540 --> 18:36.260
Yeah, well, you could think you were articulate

18:36.260 --> 18:37.380
in dealing with others.

18:37.380 --> 18:38.940
You could work in groups.

18:38.940 --> 18:41.300
You could think about social situations.

18:41.300 --> 18:43.620
You could execute projects.

18:43.620 --> 18:47.620
You had some degree of ability to communicate effectively.

18:47.620 --> 18:49.060
And you were able to shift.

18:49.060 --> 18:51.700
You were able to change roles

18:51.700 --> 18:53.300
because you weren't so specialized.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.980
You were a generalist by training.

18:55.980 --> 18:58.420
That's what they taught you is to be a generalist by training

18:58.420 --> 19:00.940
and that's often very useful in an organization.

19:00.940 --> 19:04.340
But what happens when those students are found

19:04.340 --> 19:07.340
to be less good in those generalist roles

19:08.260 --> 19:10.180
than students who went to community college

19:10.180 --> 19:11.300
or technical college?

19:11.300 --> 19:15.140
Well, then you see the decline in the enrollment

19:15.140 --> 19:17.820
because the decline in the job offers.

19:17.860 --> 19:22.700
So then you get a migration into fields

19:22.700 --> 19:25.140
that seem to be still rigorous, right?

19:25.140 --> 19:28.860
I mean, one of the reasons why we see people migrating

19:28.860 --> 19:30.860
into colleges like Catholic colleges

19:30.860 --> 19:34.100
or liberal arts colleges that are more conservative

19:34.100 --> 19:36.500
is because people are looking for where is that

19:36.500 --> 19:38.860
still rigorous liberal arts education.

19:38.860 --> 19:40.540
But I think the bigger picture is, yeah,

19:40.540 --> 19:43.500
that social science humanities space

19:43.500 --> 19:46.540
that used to generate a lot of value added

19:46.540 --> 19:48.420
is just not gonna generate the value added

19:48.420 --> 19:51.460
and employers are gonna know it, so it's gonna shrink.

19:51.460 --> 19:55.460
So if everything I've said is correct,

19:55.460 --> 19:58.140
you predict enrollments will further plummet.

19:58.140 --> 20:00.740
I wanna add on one thing that you said,

20:00.740 --> 20:02.900
maybe it's a pushback, maybe it's an add.

20:02.900 --> 20:06.140
It's not just that people aren't qualified.

20:06.140 --> 20:08.300
It's almost as if they're anti-qualified

20:08.300 --> 20:10.900
when they get degrees because they're coming in

20:10.900 --> 20:12.220
with the wrong skill sets.

20:12.220 --> 20:14.740
They're coming in not with thinking about things

20:14.740 --> 20:16.660
in terms of merit or efficiency or what have you,

20:16.660 --> 20:19.420
but in terms of developing a lens,

20:19.420 --> 20:22.300
a critical consciousness, a lens to identify racism.

20:22.300 --> 20:23.380
They're not thinking about it

20:23.380 --> 20:25.220
in terms of maximizing shareholder wealth.

20:25.220 --> 20:28.180
Like they have a different set of organizing principles

20:28.180 --> 20:30.260
that they come into the, so it could actually be

20:30.260 --> 20:32.580
an even worse thing that you hire them

20:32.580 --> 20:35.020
or as if you just hired a kind of random person

20:35.020 --> 20:36.140
who wasn't a doctorate.

20:36.140 --> 20:38.300
Like, because it's always worse to do a worse thing

20:38.300 --> 20:40.460
by definition that is to do something neutral.

20:40.460 --> 20:43.420
Yeah, but keep in mind the totality

20:43.420 --> 20:46.540
of the intellectual and social maturation

20:46.540 --> 20:51.540
that happens for a 18 year old in the four years

20:51.780 --> 20:54.420
between leaving high school and four years in college

20:54.420 --> 20:55.420
and getting out.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.620
Now, yes, what their woke professor forces them to read

20:59.620 --> 21:02.100
and write in the classroom is part of that.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.820
But if I was to put a percentage wise

21:03.820 --> 21:08.740
on that kind of inculcation of wokeness into the student

21:08.780 --> 21:11.180
as the totality in terms of the contribution

21:11.180 --> 21:13.140
to the intellectual social development,

21:13.140 --> 21:14.180
I'd say 20%.

21:14.180 --> 21:15.380
Really? Yeah.

21:15.380 --> 21:17.620
You don't think someone caught in the orbit of that idea?

21:17.620 --> 21:20.820
No, because I think 80% of what happens,

21:20.820 --> 21:23.940
80% of what actually generates value for college

21:23.940 --> 21:28.620
is simply being surrounded by smart, interesting,

21:28.620 --> 21:32.620
curious young people like yourself for four years

21:32.620 --> 21:37.100
with a certain subject as the kind of excuse to be there.

21:37.100 --> 21:39.100
But much of what happens in college,

21:39.100 --> 21:40.380
as we all know who've been there,

21:40.380 --> 21:42.820
is the conversations, the friendships,

21:42.820 --> 21:45.980
the extracurriculars, even the decoding

21:45.980 --> 21:47.740
of your stupid professor, right?

21:47.740 --> 21:51.420
I.e. the kind of mimicking what the professor wants,

21:51.420 --> 21:53.740
but knowing all along that this is nonsense

21:53.740 --> 21:55.180
or there's something wrong with that.

21:55.180 --> 21:56.380
That's actually also part

21:56.380 --> 21:58.100
of the intellectual maturation process.

21:58.100 --> 22:01.580
So, professors, and I sometimes think critics

22:01.580 --> 22:04.980
of higher education over exaggerate

22:04.980 --> 22:07.020
the role of the curriculum

22:07.020 --> 22:11.660
and the courses in what the students are doing on campus

22:11.660 --> 22:14.060
and what exactly is contributing

22:14.060 --> 22:16.260
to their intellectual and social maturation.

22:16.260 --> 22:19.220
So, students go through these programs

22:19.220 --> 22:22.180
and they come out actually amazingly normal.

22:22.180 --> 22:24.380
You know, if they studied women and black studies

22:24.380 --> 22:25.540
or something, right?

22:25.540 --> 22:27.620
But they still need to organize the bake sale.

22:27.620 --> 22:28.460
They still need to figure

22:28.460 --> 22:30.940
out their dorm room roommates for the next year.

22:30.940 --> 22:33.680
They still needed to get their flights back and forth.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.020
They still needed to get the debate team

22:36.020 --> 22:37.180
to the debate competition.

22:37.180 --> 22:38.660
They still needed to get their gym pass

22:38.660 --> 22:40.300
and go to the pool three times a week.

22:40.300 --> 22:43.580
I mean, all this stuff that's taking place on the periphery

22:43.580 --> 22:46.380
is actually part of the maturation process.

22:46.380 --> 22:47.220
I see that.

22:47.220 --> 22:49.060
I guess I don't agree.

22:49.060 --> 22:53.140
I mean, I don't agree because what you said

22:53.140 --> 22:57.940
would only be true if there were intellectual diversity

22:57.940 --> 22:59.920
among the peer group.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.060
But if there's a culture, if there's a cultural soup

23:03.100 --> 23:05.980
in which certain conclusions are forwarded

23:05.980 --> 23:08.500
and certain people aren't allowed to challenge that,

23:08.500 --> 23:10.300
it seems like being in that environment

23:10.300 --> 23:12.420
would not only be epistemologically

23:12.420 --> 23:14.940
and cognitively damaging to one's social

23:14.940 --> 23:16.820
and even emotional development,

23:16.820 --> 23:20.640
but over time it would be sclerotic

23:20.640 --> 23:23.140
in terms of muscles would atrophy

23:23.140 --> 23:25.020
that need to work through these problems.

23:25.020 --> 23:26.380
Now, yeah, you do have logistics.

23:26.380 --> 23:28.940
You'd have to like figure out how to get to the pool

23:28.940 --> 23:30.900
or you know, how to get a gym pass.

23:31.740 --> 23:36.260
But you would need to do that if you weren't in college.

23:36.260 --> 23:39.500
Yeah, but remember what's important about college

23:39.500 --> 23:40.700
is it's the peer group, right?

23:40.700 --> 23:42.500
Is that it's like a bunch of kids

23:42.500 --> 23:44.660
who wanna get further education.

23:44.660 --> 23:47.660
So the inclination or the orientation of these kids

23:47.660 --> 23:49.660
is academically, to some extent.

23:49.660 --> 23:51.260
I mean, less than the lower school.

23:51.260 --> 23:53.140
Once you're in a good state school,

23:53.140 --> 23:55.660
everyone's there to learn and to be something and to plan.

23:55.660 --> 23:56.500
That's one thing.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.220
The second thing is there's a huge difference.

23:58.220 --> 23:59.060
And I would agree with you

23:59.060 --> 24:00.860
that when we talk about small liberal arts

24:00.860 --> 24:02.860
colleges, what you say that's sclerosis

24:02.860 --> 24:04.460
and the inbreeding, absolutely.

24:04.460 --> 24:06.680
So that's why Reed College,

24:06.680 --> 24:09.580
which is close to where I live in Portland, Oregon,

24:09.580 --> 24:12.540
is the second highest ranked liberal arts college

24:12.540 --> 24:13.460
in the country.

24:13.460 --> 24:17.300
It is also the worst ranked college in the state of Oregon.

24:17.300 --> 24:20.220
One of the worst, bottom 10 worst in the entire country

24:20.220 --> 24:22.740
for taking value away from students

24:22.740 --> 24:25.420
based on what we would expect their income to be

24:25.420 --> 24:27.340
based on their incoming SAT scores.

24:27.340 --> 24:28.940
So that's how we basically add,

24:28.940 --> 24:31.380
like calculate what a college does to a person

24:31.380 --> 24:34.540
is look at their incoming SAT scores and class ranking

24:34.540 --> 24:36.740
and then say, okay, that person like that

24:36.740 --> 24:38.260
typically would end up earning this.

24:38.260 --> 24:40.060
People who go to Reed or any of these

24:40.060 --> 24:43.060
really woke liberal arts colleges way underperform.

24:43.060 --> 24:45.300
Now that's exactly evidence of what you're talking about,

24:45.300 --> 24:47.460
that that is so inbred and sclerotic

24:47.460 --> 24:49.260
and there's no diversity of thinking.

24:49.260 --> 24:51.820
But if you're at a big research university, right,

24:51.820 --> 24:55.980
don't forget that that faculty of arts and science, right,

24:55.980 --> 24:58.840
might be a very small part of the entire university.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.680
In fact, I did an article a couple of months ago

25:00.680 --> 25:05.400
on looking at all degrees awarded in the United States.

25:05.400 --> 25:10.160
And I found that only about 30% were in fields

25:10.160 --> 25:12.320
that could remotely be considered woke.

25:12.320 --> 25:15.760
So consider a university that's basically a 70-30 split,

25:15.760 --> 25:16.600
right?

25:16.600 --> 25:18.920
Now, yes, if you really don't ever leave

25:18.920 --> 25:21.120
your little college classroom

25:21.120 --> 25:23.080
and just hang out with those 30%,

25:23.080 --> 25:24.920
yeah, there'll be some sclerosis there.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.640
But you're in a sea of engineers,

25:27.640 --> 25:30.520
commerce students, dentists students, biology majors,

25:30.520 --> 25:33.760
biomedical engineering, AI, computer science,

25:33.760 --> 25:35.680
parks and recreation, right?

25:35.680 --> 25:38.240
I mean, and these are actually the fields

25:38.240 --> 25:40.160
that you're making friendships with.

25:40.160 --> 25:42.560
And so there's just such a dilution

25:42.560 --> 25:46.920
of that woke curriculum in a major research university.

25:46.920 --> 25:50.520
So I think the harm is much reduced

25:50.520 --> 25:51.840
compared to in a liberal arts college.

25:51.960 --> 25:57.960
Yeah, that's interesting and somewhat hopeful.

25:57.960 --> 26:00.200
I want to do one more thing before I talk about the case

26:00.200 --> 26:01.840
for colonialism.

26:01.840 --> 26:06.280
Do you have any predictions about specifically

26:06.280 --> 26:07.960
the academic landscape, about what

26:07.960 --> 26:11.840
we're going to see in six months or a year?

26:11.840 --> 26:16.040
So one thing that typically happens in a case like this,

26:16.080 --> 26:22.160
the cycle is we're going to see this focus on competency

26:22.160 --> 26:23.520
for university presidents.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.040
It's going to be all about competency.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.200
The diversity hires are going to be out the window.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.160
We're going to see a move to competency.

26:30.160 --> 26:32.560
We're going to see a move to the managers.

26:32.560 --> 26:35.200
I mean, it's almost like the revolutionary cycle.

26:35.200 --> 26:41.320
It's like the worst period of the revolution

26:41.320 --> 26:46.000
is now coming to an end, the sort of bloodletting

26:46.000 --> 26:49.280
and the crazy extremists who got in positions of power

26:49.280 --> 26:53.240
have finally proven to be unable to manage the organization.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.800
You get this is called Thermador.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.680
In the revolutionary calendar in France,

26:57.680 --> 26:58.640
this was called Thermador.

26:58.640 --> 27:01.760
This is when the managers came into power,

27:01.760 --> 27:06.200
settled things down, de-democratized a little bit.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.720
So the DEI and the Black Studies Association

27:08.720 --> 27:12.040
doesn't get a veto on the university president choice.

27:12.080 --> 27:15.400
Competency, proven track record,

27:15.400 --> 27:18.120
become the currency of the realm.

27:18.120 --> 27:19.640
I think that's pretty clear.

27:19.640 --> 27:22.320
That's pretty easy prediction.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.280
The more difficult prediction is.

27:24.280 --> 27:27.520
And therefore, do we see some serious efforts

27:27.520 --> 27:31.200
at re-establishing the integrity of the university?

27:31.200 --> 27:33.600
I mean, you had seen some of that coming in,

27:33.600 --> 27:37.120
in terms of faculty-led freedom of thought

27:37.120 --> 27:40.240
and academic freedom groups springing up

27:40.240 --> 27:45.680
on the margins, but if the group at Harvard is an example,

27:45.680 --> 27:48.600
that's a very weak straw to expect reform from.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.280
Steven Pinker's group, which was set up

27:51.280 --> 27:54.480
with some foundation funding to promote academic freedom

27:54.480 --> 27:56.760
at Harvard, and they said, well, we're

27:56.760 --> 27:59.240
going to have some seminars and have some teachings

27:59.240 --> 28:02.280
and talk about higher education reform and stuff.

28:02.280 --> 28:06.840
Well, it was nowhere to be seen during this entire debacle,

28:06.840 --> 28:08.240
nowhere to be seen.

28:08.240 --> 28:11.120
I predict within the next few months,

28:11.120 --> 28:13.880
we're going to see massive incidents of plagiarism.

28:13.880 --> 28:16.200
And there's a hierarchy, as I said, with DEI,

28:16.200 --> 28:17.400
the squishy stuff.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.040
I think you're going to see it in psychology.

28:19.040 --> 28:22.080
I think you're going to see it across the board.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.920
Here's my fear, and for anybody listening,

28:23.920 --> 28:30.640
I really hope that this is the case.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.520
Don't just go, I want people to research,

28:33.520 --> 28:34.400
do their own research.

28:34.400 --> 28:35.560
I want people to dig in.

28:35.560 --> 28:36.800
I want people to be sleuths.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.200
I want people to find things.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.280
But you can't just put it out there

28:41.280 --> 28:43.640
unless you are absolutely positive.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.600
Because every instance of something

28:46.600 --> 28:49.760
that you put out that you're not positive of,

28:49.760 --> 28:51.360
it's going to come back to bite you,

28:51.360 --> 28:52.600
and then people are going to say, this is all right.

28:52.600 --> 28:53.960
It's going to cloud the issue, yeah.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.960
And then you're going to have other people who

28:56.960 --> 28:59.000
want the DEI bureaucrats in place, who

28:59.000 --> 29:00.920
are going to pretend they found plagiarism, who

29:00.920 --> 29:02.320
haven't found plagiarism.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.160
I'm sure someone's already thought of that.

29:04.160 --> 29:09.960
So I am both optimistic, and I'm not optimistic.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.960
But I think we're seeing the tip of the iceberg.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.800
And again, what's to be super interesting to me

29:13.800 --> 29:18.480
is to figure out what percentage of my former colleagues

29:18.480 --> 29:20.840
or percentage of people across various disciplines

29:20.840 --> 29:21.520
have plagiarized.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.240
Because it's only a matter of time.

29:23.240 --> 29:25.520
And again, I'm not talking sloppy methodologies

29:25.520 --> 29:27.160
or what have you, which Gay also had.

29:27.160 --> 29:30.480
I'm talking actual textbook plagiarism.

29:30.480 --> 29:33.680
I don't know the answer to that, but within the next few months,

29:33.680 --> 29:34.720
we are going to find out.

29:34.720 --> 29:38.680
Certainly within six months, we're going to find out.

29:38.680 --> 29:42.120
Keep in mind, we're operating in a world

29:42.120 --> 29:46.160
where plagiarism is a rather old-fashioned concept anyways.

29:46.160 --> 29:50.840
Most young people grew up in a cut-and-paste world.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.240
That's how they did their research.

29:52.240 --> 29:53.720
So you know what I'm going to do?

29:53.720 --> 29:56.240
I'm going to take this book, The Case for Colonialism.

29:56.240 --> 29:57.720
I'm going to do exactly the same thing,

29:57.720 --> 29:59.880
but I'm going to put Peter Bogosian right there.

29:59.880 --> 30:00.960
I'm going to do the same thing.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.800
I'm going to write that it's going to be the same book.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.120
It's going to be the same title.

30:04.120 --> 30:06.400
How do you feel about that?

30:06.400 --> 30:08.880
It wouldn't surprise me in the least.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.280
No, but I mean, I'm serious.

30:10.280 --> 30:14.480
We know from our own students that they don't recognize

30:14.480 --> 30:17.200
they're doing something wrong when they cut-and-paste

30:17.200 --> 30:21.080
a Wikipedia article and lightly edit it to say what they

30:21.080 --> 30:21.880
wanted to say.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.080
And now we have chat GBT going on as well.

30:24.080 --> 30:28.240
So this is not an issue that is as cut-and-dried.

30:28.240 --> 30:31.800
It may be cut-and-dried to us from a standards perspective,

30:31.800 --> 30:34.480
but in the culture, this is not a cut-and-dried issue.

30:34.480 --> 30:37.200
Now, how easy is it for the DEI types

30:37.200 --> 30:40.680
to then segue or more likely to slipstream

30:40.680 --> 30:43.280
off that cultural assumption that we're all

30:43.280 --> 30:46.800
in this kind of mixtape kind of culture

30:46.800 --> 30:49.320
and say, well, you're just calling out this mixtaper

30:49.320 --> 30:50.760
because they're black, right?

30:50.760 --> 30:52.800
And suddenly the issue is clouded over.

30:52.800 --> 30:53.800
It's partisan.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.400
The president of Stanford was white,

30:55.400 --> 30:59.720
and he just resigned for falsification of data.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.760
Yeah, well, but that's the thing.

31:01.760 --> 31:04.440
When you come in with an idea, when you're a hammer,

31:04.440 --> 31:05.800
everything looks like a nail.

31:05.800 --> 31:08.440
So they just write those things off as anomalous.

31:08.440 --> 31:13.320
Yeah, I just don't think it's as straight a pathway

31:13.320 --> 31:17.480
as you think to say you have this long paragraph, which

31:17.480 --> 31:20.080
is verbatim from this book.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.140
There's no footnote.

31:21.140 --> 31:22.920
There's no mention of a citation.

31:22.920 --> 31:24.000
This is wrong.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.680
And you think this is a cut-and-dried case, right?

31:26.680 --> 31:28.320
Well, it's true.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.040
She should have been more careful.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.040
Duplicit of language.

31:31.040 --> 31:36.200
Yeah, or she was learning and using and was sloppy, right?

31:36.200 --> 31:41.920
But this idea that this is simply a slam-dunk case

31:41.920 --> 31:47.080
for the person to be whatever is, I think,

31:47.080 --> 31:49.000
a treasure chestnut of you and me.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.960
But I don't think that that's going to play out,

31:50.960 --> 31:52.440
especially when all you need to do

31:52.440 --> 31:54.640
is throw out some cloudy issues like race.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.000
Or, well, all these people said this was plagiarism,

31:57.000 --> 31:57.800
and it was sloppy.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.640
It turned out not to be.

31:59.640 --> 32:02.800
So we need to find an instance of somebody

32:02.800 --> 32:05.960
who is not black who lost their PhD.

32:05.960 --> 32:09.200
There must be somebody who lost their PhD for plagiarism.

32:09.200 --> 32:11.320
I'm sure there's lots, lots, lots.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.760
And so we need to.

32:12.760 --> 32:15.120
So the next thing in this is everybody.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.280
Well, I would just look up retraction watch, right?

32:17.280 --> 32:18.200
Which is retraction.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.560
Retraction watch has always done this.

32:19.560 --> 32:21.600
Oh, yeah, they retracted the hoax articles.

32:21.600 --> 32:24.240
Yeah, and anything retracted for any reason.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.000
And a lot of those are plagiarism cases.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.680
And maybe you can sort and you can see all the retractions

32:28.680 --> 32:29.240
for plagiarism.

32:29.400 --> 32:32.840
So we need to figure out an institutional way

32:32.840 --> 32:34.720
to have these people's PhDs broke.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.360
And I don't care if you're in any field, philosophy,

32:37.360 --> 32:38.640
political science.

32:38.640 --> 32:39.840
I don't care if you're a midget.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.440
I don't care what your weight is.

32:41.440 --> 32:41.840
Your height.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.040
I need to totally irrelevant.

32:43.040 --> 32:43.840
Your race.

32:43.840 --> 32:44.800
Absolutely irrelevant.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.720
If you plagiarized, you should lose your decision,

32:47.720 --> 32:49.040
including me and including you.

32:49.040 --> 32:49.920
Of course.

32:49.920 --> 32:50.680
Of course.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.960
But let's watch that play out.

32:52.960 --> 32:56.480
And ultimately, it'll always surprise us how it does.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.360
It's funny, though, also because I

32:58.400 --> 32:59.520
advocate these positions.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.920
I'm suddenly a conservative.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.160
That's what fascinates me.

33:03.400 --> 33:07.800
Yeah, although remember, you know, sometimes it's the room

33:07.800 --> 33:08.680
outside the room.

33:08.680 --> 33:13.320
And I think if you spend a lot of time inside the room,

33:13.320 --> 33:18.400
you're not aware that actually outside of the room,

33:18.400 --> 33:19.840
the dynamics are very different.

33:19.840 --> 33:23.080
So, you know, of course, you're a conservative within the

33:23.080 --> 33:25.760
higher academic or cultural wars perspective,

33:25.760 --> 33:28.120
because all the people you're arguing against

33:28.120 --> 33:30.560
are far left lunatics, right?

33:30.560 --> 33:34.440
But in normal society, people would probably see you as too

33:34.440 --> 33:36.440
much of a kind of waffly liberal.

33:36.440 --> 33:37.280
Yeah, liberal liberal.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.720
Yeah, and in American political discourse,

33:39.720 --> 33:43.040
you'd be kind of like suspicious center or center leftist.

33:43.040 --> 33:47.320
So actually, you know, it's like where you

33:47.320 --> 33:49.360
calibrating yourself, you know?

33:49.360 --> 33:51.800
And if you're in the lunatic asylum,

33:51.800 --> 33:54.160
you're going to be the sanest person there.

33:54.160 --> 33:57.160
Doesn't mean you don't have some mental issues in society.

33:57.160 --> 33:57.920
Right, right.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.720
So, OK, so let's go back.

33:59.720 --> 34:04.600
So I required the case for colonialism for all my students.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.560
Talk a little bit, if you don't mind, about that.

34:06.560 --> 34:09.560
That was a crazy controversy.

34:09.560 --> 34:13.920
So people lost their minds at you.

34:13.920 --> 34:14.480
Tell us about it.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.560
I know you've talked about it before, but just tell us about it.

34:17.560 --> 34:22.080
So as 2017, this article came out, so it's six years now.

34:22.080 --> 34:25.720
The article was basically a backgrounder for myself,

34:25.720 --> 34:28.720
because I was about to write the biography of a British colonial

34:28.720 --> 34:32.560
official, and he had written and said a lot about the case

34:32.560 --> 34:34.880
for colonialism, but he wasn't a scholar.

34:34.880 --> 34:35.560
He was an official.

34:35.560 --> 34:38.120
He was giving speeches, and it was kind of all over the place.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.400
I was like, let's bring some order to this argument.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.000
Like, what exactly is the argument?

34:42.000 --> 34:44.200
How does it run logically?

34:44.200 --> 34:49.320
And so I essentially put this argument together

34:49.320 --> 34:52.080
to be useful for myself before I wrote the book.

34:52.080 --> 34:55.000
So when I came to kind of some ways repeating

34:55.160 --> 34:56.760
and making sense of what he had said,

34:56.760 --> 34:57.920
I could organize a little better.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.200
So who's the reason?

34:59.200 --> 35:02.000
Sir Allen Burns was a British colonial official.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.120
The book was called The Last Imperialist.

35:04.120 --> 35:07.440
Ended up coming out in 2019.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.880
And it was very successful.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.840
But this was a backgrounder to that, essentially, for myself.

35:11.840 --> 35:15.280
But I thought, hey, this is useful,

35:15.280 --> 35:17.760
because there's not this article out there.

35:17.760 --> 35:20.240
We always have the case for this, the case for that,

35:20.240 --> 35:22.760
in defense of this, or against this, whatever.

35:22.760 --> 35:24.760
That's part of the academic discourse.

35:24.760 --> 35:26.800
And I had published an article two years earlier

35:26.800 --> 35:31.040
on Chinua Kebe, the African novelist,

35:31.040 --> 35:33.240
saying that this guy who is supposedly

35:33.240 --> 35:35.760
this pantheonic figure in anti-colonialism

35:35.760 --> 35:37.520
actually wasn't anti-colonial at all.

35:37.520 --> 35:40.040
Or at least he had mixed views,

35:40.040 --> 35:41.600
would be a charitable reading.

35:41.600 --> 35:42.640
Okay, let me pause you.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.400
Explain colonialism.

35:44.400 --> 35:47.240
What is that in two sentences?

35:47.240 --> 35:48.960
Colonialism, in one sentence,

35:48.960 --> 35:53.360
is when country A extends its governance system

35:53.400 --> 35:55.080
over territory B,

35:55.080 --> 35:58.440
which does not have a sovereign governing system at the time.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.400
Okay, all right, so that situates it.

36:00.400 --> 36:05.400
So you wrote The Case for Colonialism in 2017,

36:05.880 --> 36:08.200
and you published it in Third World Quarterly,

36:08.200 --> 36:12.040
which, high impact factor journal, correct me if I'm wrong.

36:12.040 --> 36:12.880
Yeah.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.840
Right, so it's very reputable.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.880
It wasn't, you know, back of a magazine,

36:16.880 --> 36:19.720
it was a very highly reputable academic journal.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.040
And what happened?

36:21.040 --> 36:22.880
Well, it got two reviews.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.720
One was positive, one was negative.

36:24.720 --> 36:26.320
So typically in a case like that,

36:26.320 --> 36:28.080
it goes to the editor,

36:28.080 --> 36:30.400
and the editor can make a decision,

36:30.400 --> 36:31.640
accept or reject.

36:32.680 --> 36:34.720
And funnily enough,

36:34.720 --> 36:35.920
I had the same experience

36:35.920 --> 36:38.440
with the first journal I submitted it to,

36:38.440 --> 36:40.800
the Journal of Intervention and State Building.

36:40.800 --> 36:43.140
Got one except one reject.

36:43.140 --> 36:45.200
And the managing editor,

36:45.200 --> 36:48.840
rather than making his call based on academic criteria

36:48.840 --> 36:49.880
or his judgment,

36:49.880 --> 36:51.520
went to the board and said,

36:51.560 --> 36:52.880
I'd really like to publish this,

36:52.880 --> 36:54.800
but I'm kind of afraid of the backlash.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.840
And the board said, you're right,

36:56.840 --> 36:58.660
too politically risky,

36:58.660 --> 37:00.920
give it a reject because of the political backlash.

37:00.920 --> 37:02.080
Right, so not that it was false,

37:02.080 --> 37:04.280
sort of a sloppy, sloppy organization.

37:04.280 --> 37:06.680
Afraid to publish it, afraid to publish it.

37:06.680 --> 37:10.480
And I've named him in the book, you know, it's all public.

37:10.480 --> 37:13.200
So Third World Quarterly was the same except reject,

37:13.200 --> 37:15.440
but this time the editor did what an editor

37:15.440 --> 37:16.280
is supposed to do,

37:16.280 --> 37:18.880
just exercise his or her judgment

37:18.880 --> 37:21.000
in terms of the academic merit.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.840
Merit, merit.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.840
Merit, whether the article would contribute

37:24.840 --> 37:26.800
to the journal, spark a debate.

37:26.800 --> 37:28.360
And he said, yes, this is great.

37:28.360 --> 37:29.640
Let's run it.

37:29.640 --> 37:32.520
He said, let's run it as a commentary article

37:32.520 --> 37:34.920
rather than as original research article.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.920
So it's a peer-reviewed commentary article

37:36.920 --> 37:38.920
rather than a peer-reviewed research article.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.800
But, you know, like most journals,

37:40.800 --> 37:43.400
they have a variety of types of peer-reviewed articles

37:43.400 --> 37:44.720
that they accept, you know,

37:44.720 --> 37:46.920
short research contributions, research articles,

37:46.920 --> 37:48.820
commentaries, whatever I said, fine.

37:48.820 --> 37:50.620
Publish it as a commentary article.

37:51.700 --> 37:56.340
Within minutes of its appearance online

37:56.340 --> 37:59.560
before its formal publication in the journal,

37:59.560 --> 38:01.740
there was an outrage storm on Facebook,

38:01.740 --> 38:03.420
started on Facebook, right?

38:03.420 --> 38:05.900
Because a friend of mine in Australia said,

38:05.900 --> 38:07.900
oh, you're like not my Facebook page, mate.

38:07.900 --> 38:10.580
Well done, you know, in email to me.

38:10.580 --> 38:11.420
That's good, dude.

38:11.420 --> 38:15.260
Yeah, and I said, what's going on?

38:15.260 --> 38:16.900
I saw a colleague of mine on the street.

38:16.900 --> 38:19.060
She said, do you know what's happening out there?

38:19.060 --> 38:21.020
I was like, no, you mean the article?

38:21.020 --> 38:23.620
Yeah, oh, she said it's much bigger than you think.

38:23.620 --> 38:25.420
By the time I got back to my desk,

38:25.420 --> 38:29.700
I mean, thousands of hate mails filling up my email box,

38:29.700 --> 38:33.660
such that my email at Portland State

38:33.660 --> 38:34.940
stopped accepting new emails.

38:34.940 --> 38:37.580
It crashed my email box, basically.

38:37.580 --> 38:39.940
And then two petitions started up, right?

38:39.940 --> 38:43.220
One petitioned by a woman who was a graduate

38:43.220 --> 38:45.460
of interpretive dance in the UK.

38:46.180 --> 38:47.980
You just can't make it up, OK?

38:47.980 --> 38:53.860
Saying stop reading the Third World Quarterly,

38:53.860 --> 38:55.700
punish the Third World Quarterly.

38:55.700 --> 39:00.700
The other started by a tenured academic at Syracuse University

39:00.700 --> 39:04.980
called Farhana Sultana from Bangladesh,

39:04.980 --> 39:07.740
who obviously didn't get the message when she migrated

39:07.740 --> 39:09.700
to the United States that this is a free country

39:09.700 --> 39:12.100
and we're supposed to uphold academic freedom.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.460
A Princeton graduate, by the way.

39:14.460 --> 39:16.580
My alma mater.

39:16.580 --> 39:20.900
Farhana Sultana said that we demand

39:20.900 --> 39:22.460
the article be retracted.

39:22.460 --> 39:25.820
We demand that both Gilly and the editor of the Third World

39:25.820 --> 39:27.380
Quarterly apologize.

39:27.380 --> 39:30.620
And then, separately, on her Facebook page,

39:30.620 --> 39:35.980
she started a petition to have my PhD from Princeton to vote.

39:35.980 --> 39:39.220
And so by the time it was all said and done,

39:39.220 --> 39:44.100
more than 40,000 people had signed these two petitions.

39:44.100 --> 39:46.180
And ultimately, the way it was resolved

39:46.180 --> 39:49.100
was the editorial staff of the Third World

39:49.100 --> 39:51.540
Quarterly in London were getting death threats.

39:51.540 --> 39:52.060
Right.

39:52.060 --> 39:53.020
Credible death threats.

39:53.020 --> 39:54.220
Yes, credible death threats.

39:54.220 --> 39:58.140
And the Metropolitan Police said to them,

39:58.140 --> 40:00.820
we can't promise you safety.

40:00.820 --> 40:03.540
We don't assign bodyguard units to everybody.

40:03.540 --> 40:06.580
So the editor called me.

40:06.580 --> 40:07.740
The editor called me.

40:07.740 --> 40:09.580
And I said, of course, retract it.

40:09.580 --> 40:11.140
Withdrawed is the correct term.

40:11.140 --> 40:11.620
Withdrawed.

40:11.620 --> 40:12.460
Was not retracted.

40:12.460 --> 40:16.420
It was withdrawn by me for the physical safety of the staff

40:16.420 --> 40:20.260
there, reprinted in academic questions, separate journal,

40:20.260 --> 40:23.620
and then eventually formed the core of the book that's

40:23.620 --> 40:24.620
the case for colonialism.

40:24.620 --> 40:27.820
OK, so this is so fascinating to me

40:27.820 --> 40:30.820
and so many others, because I had people coming up to me

40:30.820 --> 40:33.420
when I defended you for that.

40:33.420 --> 40:38.380
And I actually sent out some emails to people saying,

40:38.380 --> 40:40.260
because there was something at PSU, right,

40:40.260 --> 40:42.340
where they wanted you sanctioned.

40:42.340 --> 40:46.300
They wanted you to tell us about that.

40:46.300 --> 40:48.940
Right, so I got a lot of hate mail from PSU as well.

40:48.940 --> 40:53.180
Eventually, the provost at the time issued a statement.

40:53.180 --> 40:56.020
This was like within a week of the outburst.

40:56.020 --> 40:59.580
And I mean, this is like a provost statement on the issue

40:59.580 --> 41:04.100
saying, Dr. Gilley published this article.

41:04.100 --> 41:10.380
It doesn't represent the views of the faculty at Portland State.

41:10.420 --> 41:12.580
Some people say he should be fired,

41:12.580 --> 41:15.980
but we have this thing called academic freedom.

41:15.980 --> 41:20.300
So we encourage people to debate and discuss and rebut his

41:20.300 --> 41:22.140
arguments.

41:22.140 --> 41:25.340
I suppose people said that was a good response,

41:25.340 --> 41:29.100
because she was saying we can't act.

41:29.100 --> 41:31.620
To me, it was a lame-ass response,

41:31.620 --> 41:35.020
because she said we can't act.

41:35.020 --> 41:38.380
In other words, if I could fire this guy, I would.

41:38.380 --> 41:39.940
Unfortunately, we have this problem

41:39.940 --> 41:43.300
called academic freedom, which protects right-wing fascists

41:43.300 --> 41:44.380
like Gilley.

41:44.380 --> 41:48.140
And if we fired him, we'd be violating our state

41:48.140 --> 41:50.060
constitution, which we would be in addition

41:50.060 --> 41:51.900
to his academic freedom.

41:51.900 --> 41:57.460
It was hardly we are dismayed that our faculty members have

41:57.460 --> 42:00.780
participated in the mob to silence Dr. Gilley,

42:00.780 --> 42:04.380
because so many PSU faculty members signed those petitions,

42:04.380 --> 42:06.380
including one who's now my departmental colleague,

42:06.380 --> 42:08.700
because her department failed, and we acquired it.

42:08.700 --> 42:11.140
See, that's fascinating to me, because I don't know if I've

42:11.140 --> 42:15.460
told you this, but I caught massive shit for defending you

42:15.460 --> 42:17.140
and saying, and I sent out emails,

42:17.140 --> 42:19.940
and I said, if you have a problem with this,

42:19.940 --> 42:21.100
because there was a vote.

42:21.100 --> 42:23.620
I can't remember what was something like someone voted.

42:23.620 --> 42:25.900
And I said, I'd like to find all those people who voted,

42:25.900 --> 42:29.700
and I'd like to moderate a debate on stage between you

42:29.700 --> 42:31.180
and Dr. Gilley.

42:31.180 --> 42:32.820
And guess how many people took that up?

42:32.820 --> 42:33.380
Right.

42:33.380 --> 42:33.900
Zero.

42:33.900 --> 42:36.660
So yeah, there was an attempt at a faculty resolution

42:36.660 --> 42:39.820
condemning me that failed.

42:39.820 --> 42:42.020
So it was those people, I think.

42:42.020 --> 42:45.540
I said, everybody who I said, I'd like to have you on stage.

42:45.540 --> 42:48.620
So if you have a problem with this, that's great,

42:48.620 --> 42:51.460
that you're totally entitled to do that.

42:51.460 --> 42:54.300
Let's go on stage, and we'll have that public conversation.

42:54.300 --> 42:54.980
We'll be free.

42:54.980 --> 42:56.660
We'll throw through through some student unit,

42:56.660 --> 42:58.060
and we'll have that conversation.

42:58.060 --> 43:00.220
Nobody took me up on it.

43:00.220 --> 43:01.020
Zero.

43:01.020 --> 43:03.380
So they were against something, but they don't feel,

43:03.380 --> 43:07.460
they don't know enough about what they're against to feel

43:07.460 --> 43:08.900
that they can defend it.

43:08.900 --> 43:11.140
Well, what they told themselves is,

43:11.140 --> 43:13.620
this is like agreeing to a debate on the Holocaust.

43:13.620 --> 43:16.620
And I won't participate in this because it would just

43:16.620 --> 43:18.700
normalize this as a debate.

43:18.700 --> 43:20.140
This is not debatable.

43:20.140 --> 43:23.060
Colonialism was evil, lock stock and barrel.

43:23.060 --> 43:26.380
And even having the temerity to ask me to debate it

43:26.380 --> 43:28.820
shows how unreformed you are.

43:28.820 --> 43:30.660
And we really need to shut this down.

43:30.660 --> 43:32.100
So OK, whatever.

43:32.140 --> 43:34.180
That's just the totalitarian mindset.

43:34.180 --> 43:37.940
But having failed at the faculty senate level,

43:37.940 --> 43:43.020
the faculty union really just Jennifer Ruth, a film studies

43:43.020 --> 43:45.100
professor who was the academic freedom

43:45.100 --> 43:48.220
director at the faculty union, who later wrote a book,

43:48.220 --> 43:50.180
Attacking Me and Other Faculty Members.

43:50.180 --> 43:53.300
Got how well is that academic freedom?

43:53.300 --> 43:54.180
Academic freedom director.

43:54.180 --> 43:56.700
So the faculty union passed a resolution

43:56.700 --> 43:58.060
condemning my research.

43:58.060 --> 43:59.940
I call it a fatwa, because that's what it is.

43:59.940 --> 44:00.780
It's still out there.

44:00.780 --> 44:03.060
They haven't revoked the fatwa.

44:03.060 --> 44:06.180
So I'm still under fatwa from the PSU faculty union.

44:06.180 --> 44:09.580
And then my department chair, Melody Valdini,

44:09.580 --> 44:13.220
commissioned a report from some of our senior colleagues

44:13.220 --> 44:15.500
about how I could be shut down, what

44:15.500 --> 44:18.220
they could do to curtail me or silence me,

44:18.220 --> 44:20.500
included things like forcing me to never say

44:20.500 --> 44:23.500
I was a PSU faculty member.

44:23.500 --> 44:30.060
And passing a faculty resolution condemning my research

44:30.060 --> 44:34.500
and requiring me to pre-notify the faculty chair any time

44:34.500 --> 44:37.900
I was about to publish an article or an essay that

44:37.900 --> 44:41.180
might potentially be controversial.

44:41.180 --> 44:45.060
Only me would be subject to this.

44:45.060 --> 44:49.660
She then convenes a secret meeting of everyone except me

44:49.660 --> 44:51.460
to talk about this.

44:51.460 --> 44:53.180
And then they have a departmental meeting

44:53.180 --> 44:55.860
to vote on it, which I don't go to.

44:55.860 --> 44:57.540
Neither does one of my senior colleagues

44:57.540 --> 44:59.180
who thinks the whole thing is obnoxious.

44:59.220 --> 45:02.540
And the resolution passes.

45:02.540 --> 45:04.140
You just can't make it up.

45:04.140 --> 45:05.140
You can't make it up.

45:05.140 --> 45:08.220
So according to my faculty right now,

45:08.220 --> 45:10.180
I'm subject to these special burdens.

45:10.180 --> 45:12.980
I'm not supposed to say I work at Portland State.

45:12.980 --> 45:16.260
I'm supposed to notify my chair any time

45:16.260 --> 45:20.500
about to write something controversial.

45:20.500 --> 45:25.300
And I'm not supposed to engage further in the colonialism

45:25.300 --> 45:26.380
debate in the classroom.

45:29.180 --> 45:31.220
You can see how closely I've abided by that, right?

45:31.220 --> 45:32.780
Because they're completely out of line.

45:32.780 --> 45:33.820
But what does this tell you?

45:33.820 --> 45:37.460
I mean, so this isn't this passed by a majority

45:37.460 --> 45:39.820
of vote of my own department.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.260
You're tenured and you're a senior.

45:41.260 --> 45:42.500
Of course I'm fully tenured, yeah.

45:42.500 --> 45:43.980
Well, I just want to make clear.

45:43.980 --> 45:45.820
Then you're a full professor.

45:45.820 --> 45:47.820
Yeah, then that department chair tried

45:47.820 --> 45:49.740
to prevent me getting post-tenure reviews.

45:49.740 --> 45:52.460
OK, so can we talk about that?

45:52.460 --> 45:53.780
I find that fascinating.

45:53.780 --> 45:57.940
So last time I looked, and I haven't looked recently,

45:57.940 --> 46:01.060
there was a list of faculty member.

46:01.060 --> 46:03.620
And I don't know the metrics for this.

46:03.620 --> 46:05.740
I would imagine that just you aggregate something

46:05.740 --> 46:06.620
from Google Scholar.

46:06.620 --> 46:10.180
But I don't really know of the people who most

46:10.180 --> 46:11.700
published in the university.

46:11.700 --> 46:14.660
Your name is consistently in the top 10.

46:14.660 --> 46:15.940
Consistently in the top 10.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.700
And the only one in our department,

46:17.700 --> 46:19.380
the only one in our school of government,

46:19.380 --> 46:21.100
the only one of two in our college.

46:21.100 --> 46:27.700
OK, and we can edit this out if this is too revealing.

46:30.260 --> 46:32.740
Wasn't the thing about the post-tenure review

46:32.740 --> 46:34.860
they said you didn't publish enough?

46:34.860 --> 46:38.340
There was something in there about that, wasn't it?

46:38.340 --> 46:39.540
Yes, yes, yes.

46:39.540 --> 46:42.780
My publication record was insufficient.

46:42.780 --> 46:45.460
Of course, it's since tenure, right?

46:45.460 --> 46:47.900
But I'd published a lot since getting tenure.

46:47.900 --> 46:49.140
Four journal articles.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.180
More than Clotting Gay.

46:50.180 --> 46:51.820
Three books.

46:51.820 --> 46:55.260
And the argument was, but the real argument

46:55.260 --> 46:58.980
was the case for colonialism discredited all

46:58.980 --> 47:02.260
of my prior scholarship because it was just clickbait

47:02.260 --> 47:03.980
for right-wing websites.

47:03.980 --> 47:08.260
And the fact that it had been withdrawn just showed

47:08.260 --> 47:10.300
it was academically flawed.

47:10.300 --> 47:13.540
In other words, intentionally ignoring

47:13.540 --> 47:16.620
the facts of the case about why it was withdrawn, which

47:16.620 --> 47:18.860
was not any problem with the peer review process.

47:19.500 --> 47:21.740
Physical safety of the staff was why it was withdrawn.

47:21.740 --> 47:23.100
It had nothing to do with the academic.

47:23.100 --> 47:25.700
And then she had the temerity to say,

47:25.700 --> 47:29.260
all those citations to the case for colonialism

47:29.260 --> 47:34.460
are really just evidence of an academic network

47:34.460 --> 47:37.220
trying to boost his citation count.

47:37.220 --> 47:39.100
And no, look at the citations.

47:39.100 --> 47:44.180
They're from gender studies and coloniality weekly.

47:44.180 --> 47:45.740
They're all mostly critical citations.

47:45.740 --> 47:47.940
But whatever, my job as an academic

47:47.980 --> 47:50.340
is to stimulate others to think more.

47:50.340 --> 47:51.700
And citations reflect.

47:51.700 --> 47:52.940
I'm glad you look at it, by the way.

47:52.940 --> 47:54.060
I'm glad you look at it like that.

47:54.060 --> 47:57.620
Citations reflect the extent to which people feel your work

47:57.620 --> 48:00.260
engages them, whether for good or for bad.

48:00.260 --> 48:02.380
Yeah, by the way, just as a parenthetical,

48:02.380 --> 48:04.980
the conceptual penis is a social construct.

48:04.980 --> 48:10.100
Most papers in the humanity, I think it's some.

48:10.100 --> 48:16.300
So this is a little fuzzy because someone, when this originally

48:16.300 --> 48:20.100
came out, they mixed commentary, as you said before.

48:20.100 --> 48:27.980
But I think 75% percent of papers in the humanities

48:27.980 --> 48:30.420
are cited between zero and one times.

48:30.420 --> 48:31.700
So that's amazing.

48:31.700 --> 48:33.180
The conceptual penis has been cited.

48:33.180 --> 48:35.980
I don't even know how many times, but dozens of times.

48:35.980 --> 48:37.540
Well, now it has an afterlife.

48:37.540 --> 48:38.900
It has an afterlife.

48:38.900 --> 48:39.900
But so here's.

48:39.900 --> 48:43.620
Because it's now cited as an article that

48:43.620 --> 48:47.740
was a hoax article as part of the discussion on epistemiology.

48:47.740 --> 48:50.060
Which is still cited.

48:50.060 --> 48:55.020
I think it's in the top 1% or higher of all gender studies

48:55.020 --> 48:56.500
articles.

48:56.500 --> 48:57.660
It's crazy.

48:57.660 --> 48:59.460
So I'm one of the most cited gender studies

48:59.460 --> 49:01.340
scholars of all time.

49:01.340 --> 49:03.060
But I just, before.

49:03.060 --> 49:04.060
You dick.

49:04.060 --> 49:08.780
I can't help myself.

49:08.780 --> 49:10.660
OK, so I want to talk about, because I've

49:10.660 --> 49:12.780
been thinking about this.

49:12.780 --> 49:15.220
Before we delve into the case of colonialism,

49:15.220 --> 49:18.100
I want to talk about what you're saying about the citations.

49:18.100 --> 49:22.140
Because I don't think that's a particularly good.

49:22.140 --> 49:24.540
I think it's a very broad metric.

49:24.540 --> 49:27.660
Because again, I only want to go to Claudine Gaye right now.

49:27.660 --> 49:28.820
Because I've read her stuff.

49:28.820 --> 49:30.660
And her stuff has hundreds of citations.

49:30.660 --> 49:34.140
I think my most cited article is like 500 and something.

49:34.140 --> 49:36.460
It's like behaviorism, constructivism, and saccharic

49:36.460 --> 49:37.900
pedigar or something.

49:37.980 --> 49:40.580
But her stuff is picked up by a bunch

49:40.580 --> 49:42.340
of all these race hucksters.

49:42.340 --> 49:44.180
They just cite their own things.

49:44.180 --> 49:47.180
And it artificially props up the citation rate.

49:47.180 --> 49:49.380
So you can't just look at the h-index

49:49.380 --> 49:51.380
or the number of citations.

49:51.380 --> 49:53.980
And that's, I mean, it kind of tells you something.

49:53.980 --> 49:55.460
But it kind of does not tell you something.

49:55.460 --> 49:57.180
It's what we call a rough indicator, right?

49:57.180 --> 49:57.860
It's a rough indicator.

49:57.860 --> 49:59.460
It's a rough indicator that has a lot

49:59.460 --> 50:02.100
of what we call reliability problems.

50:02.100 --> 50:04.700
Which means there's a lot of noise in that indicator, right?

50:05.460 --> 50:08.860
So it is probably generally tracking

50:08.860 --> 50:10.700
scholarly productivity.

50:10.700 --> 50:12.940
But there's a lot of noise in that indicator

50:12.940 --> 50:15.020
because of the sorts of things you talk about.

50:15.020 --> 50:16.740
Where you publish, whether it just

50:16.740 --> 50:20.020
takes one other scholar to cite it in a way

50:20.020 --> 50:23.300
that it becomes a kind of what we call a reflexive citation

50:23.300 --> 50:24.100
for others.

50:24.100 --> 50:27.620
Like every time you write about topic X, you cite this one.

50:27.620 --> 50:29.940
And none of those people have ever read your article.

50:29.940 --> 50:31.420
It's called a junk citation.

50:31.420 --> 50:33.900
If you become a junk citation, your citation

50:34.060 --> 50:36.060
goes off the charts because everyone just

50:36.060 --> 50:37.860
feels they need to cite you.

50:37.860 --> 50:40.460
So every time someone writes an article about topic X,

50:40.460 --> 50:41.300
they always throw this in.

50:41.300 --> 50:42.180
It's a junk citation.

50:42.180 --> 50:42.860
They never read it.

50:42.860 --> 50:43.980
They never thought about it.

50:43.980 --> 50:44.940
But it's just there.

50:44.940 --> 50:47.380
So there's a lot of noise on the upside.

50:47.380 --> 50:49.580
There's a lot of noise on the downside, too.

50:49.580 --> 50:54.020
So some really important articles don't get cited much

50:54.020 --> 50:57.540
because people end up not citing the original or even

50:57.540 --> 50:58.980
knowing that was the original.

50:58.980 --> 51:03.660
Because it's someone else who talked about that issue, who

51:03.660 --> 51:05.020
gets all the citations.

51:05.020 --> 51:08.060
So you can be deflated down and you can be deflated up.

51:08.060 --> 51:08.980
Yeah, it's good.

51:08.980 --> 51:11.380
I think I like the idea that it's rough.

51:11.380 --> 51:13.140
I mean, I remember when I went up for promotion,

51:13.140 --> 51:17.620
I had a higher H index than anybody on my committee

51:17.620 --> 51:19.020
than my department chair, everyone.

51:19.020 --> 51:23.740
And again, I think that there's a kind of anti-meritocratic

51:23.740 --> 51:26.580
element, particularly operative at PSU.

51:26.580 --> 51:29.500
OK, so anyway, back to the case for colonialism.

51:29.500 --> 51:32.940
So you can kind of, or you can figure out

51:32.940 --> 51:34.100
the thesis from the title.

51:34.100 --> 51:36.460
This is not a particularly complicated thing.

51:36.460 --> 51:39.580
And I think because it was so easy to grasp,

51:39.580 --> 51:43.700
that people picked up on it and just went completely bananas.

51:43.700 --> 51:47.700
So when you started the interview off,

51:47.700 --> 51:49.620
when I said you sat down with my son and I,

51:49.620 --> 51:53.700
and you explained it to me, and it was like a massive light bulb.

51:53.700 --> 51:55.220
Do you remember that conversation?

51:55.220 --> 51:55.940
Yeah.

51:55.940 --> 52:01.140
And so could you explain in a nutshell for people

52:01.140 --> 52:04.900
who are not familiar with historical colonialism,

52:04.900 --> 52:07.740
like what in a nutshell is the case for colonialism?

52:07.740 --> 52:09.980
And why does it matter that people,

52:09.980 --> 52:11.620
beyond the academic controversies,

52:11.620 --> 52:15.660
like why does this subject matter?

52:15.660 --> 52:19.460
So the easiest way to think about the case for colonialism

52:19.460 --> 52:22.740
is it's a bit like saying the case for oxygen in the atmosphere.

52:22.740 --> 52:26.180
Like, do you really think we'd be here

52:26.180 --> 52:27.740
if there were no oxygen in the atmosphere?

52:27.740 --> 52:32.900
Colonialism wasn't a bunch of people in pith hats

52:32.900 --> 52:34.740
jumping into a ship with guns and say,

52:34.740 --> 52:37.380
let's go repress and conquer black people.

52:37.380 --> 52:40.340
Colonialism was part of a huge structural transformation

52:40.340 --> 52:43.740
of the world that began with the rise of Europe

52:43.740 --> 52:46.860
and the separation of European development from the rest.

52:46.860 --> 52:49.420
The great divergence it's called in economic history,

52:49.420 --> 52:53.020
when the Europe just took off politically, economically,

52:53.020 --> 52:56.660
socially, organizationally, militarily, technologically.

52:56.660 --> 53:00.300
Suddenly this huge gap emerged between Europe and the rest.

53:00.300 --> 53:03.020
Now, when is that post-Renaissance?

53:03.020 --> 53:07.860
So 17th, 1600s, basically, early 1600s.

53:07.860 --> 53:11.700
I mean, Britain's first colonies are like Bermuda, 1603.

53:11.700 --> 53:14.180
This is the first time, the Spanish and the Portuguese.

53:14.180 --> 53:16.580
And then this accelerates all the way through the 19th century

53:16.580 --> 53:18.300
into the early 20th century.

53:18.300 --> 53:24.860
So Europe was spreading out whether you liked it or not.

53:24.900 --> 53:26.580
So this is the first thing to remember.

53:26.580 --> 53:29.940
People assume there's some kind of volunteerism all the time.

53:29.940 --> 53:31.900
They decided, they sat down and said,

53:31.900 --> 53:33.740
let's go colonize the world.

53:33.740 --> 53:35.620
Never happened.

53:35.620 --> 53:38.700
Europe spread out because it had things to trade.

53:38.700 --> 53:39.740
It had guns.

53:39.740 --> 53:41.580
It had shipping technology.

53:41.580 --> 53:42.740
It had missionaries.

53:42.740 --> 53:44.180
It had explorers.

53:44.180 --> 53:45.820
It had scientists.

53:45.820 --> 53:49.300
It had people who were interested in establishing

53:49.300 --> 53:51.380
understanding of foreign cultures.

53:51.380 --> 53:54.220
All this was going to happen no matter

53:54.220 --> 53:56.860
whether governments were part of it or not.

53:56.860 --> 53:59.460
Europe was coming for the world.

53:59.460 --> 54:01.060
It was going to engage the world.

54:01.060 --> 54:03.500
So that's the first thing to remember.

54:03.500 --> 54:06.100
What we call the push factors were not governments

54:06.100 --> 54:08.300
like planning colonial expeditions.

54:08.300 --> 54:12.180
It was simply this massively advanced civilization

54:12.180 --> 54:13.740
expanding around the world.

54:13.740 --> 54:19.300
Second part, on the demand side, almost always,

54:19.300 --> 54:20.820
these people were welcomed.

54:20.820 --> 54:22.740
The relationships were friendly.

54:22.740 --> 54:23.540
Why?

54:23.540 --> 54:26.740
Because the Europeans offered things that were useful.

54:26.740 --> 54:28.060
They brought food.

54:28.060 --> 54:29.300
They brought metal.

54:29.300 --> 54:30.900
They brought technology.

54:30.900 --> 54:33.620
They often brought protection from a local rival.

54:33.620 --> 54:37.100
I mean, the way that Nigeria became a British colony

54:37.100 --> 54:39.660
is basically that the king of Lagos

54:39.660 --> 54:43.300
had been chased off his throne by internal rivals.

54:43.300 --> 54:46.060
And he asked the British to come on shore

54:46.060 --> 54:47.140
and put him back on his seat.

54:47.140 --> 54:49.580
And his local ally said, yes, please come.

54:49.580 --> 54:51.860
And for God's sake, colonize us.

54:51.900 --> 54:55.180
Because otherwise, we're going to be swamped and degraded

54:55.180 --> 54:58.460
and enslaved by this group that's slightly to the north of us.

54:58.460 --> 55:01.740
And that's the common pattern of how European colonialism

55:01.740 --> 55:05.860
was established, was we call these the pull factors.

55:05.860 --> 55:10.700
Local populations almost always welcomed, collaborated with,

55:10.700 --> 55:14.740
cooperated with, or at least accommodated,

55:14.740 --> 55:17.060
the European expansion.

55:17.060 --> 55:21.340
So the idea of force and resistance is nonsense.

55:21.340 --> 55:23.700
It's not a historically accurate picture

55:23.700 --> 55:28.820
of how Europe came to occupy through colonial control,

55:28.820 --> 55:31.060
depending on how you look at it, 2-thirds or 3-quarters

55:31.060 --> 55:32.260
of the globe.

55:32.260 --> 55:35.540
So in part, there's no case to be made

55:35.540 --> 55:38.620
other than it's like the case for volcanoes or something.

55:38.620 --> 55:40.820
Like, we don't decide whether or not

55:40.820 --> 55:42.260
there are volcanoes in the world.

55:42.260 --> 55:43.540
There just are.

55:43.540 --> 55:45.340
Colonialism was of that sort.

55:45.340 --> 55:47.100
It just was going to happen.

55:47.100 --> 55:50.540
It's a classic example of civilizational rise

55:50.540 --> 55:52.820
and expansion that's happened throughout human history.

55:52.820 --> 55:54.300
OK, so what about this guy?

55:54.300 --> 55:56.780
Wasn't King Leopold like a real, I mean,

55:56.780 --> 56:00.860
my conception is he's a real, just a true, nasty son

56:00.860 --> 56:03.180
of a bitch who used to chop off?

56:03.180 --> 56:04.100
No, no, all wrong.

56:04.100 --> 56:05.580
In fact, I have an article.

56:05.580 --> 56:08.420
One of the chapters is called Indefensive Leopold's Congo.

56:08.420 --> 56:10.900
So most people's understanding of the Congo Free State,

56:10.900 --> 56:13.900
which was before the Belgian takeover of that.

56:13.900 --> 56:19.420
So this was a private colony rather than a Belgian colony,

56:19.420 --> 56:23.460
it comes from Adam Haas Child's book, King Leopold's Ghost,

56:23.460 --> 56:26.100
which I've shown is a vast fabrication.

56:26.100 --> 56:26.500
It's strange.

56:26.500 --> 56:28.780
There was no population.

56:28.780 --> 56:32.740
I have to tell you this, the way where I got that from

56:32.740 --> 56:39.260
is my kid, my son, I'm actually his name,

56:39.260 --> 56:47.500
brought home papers in his senior year from that book.

56:47.500 --> 56:48.540
And that's where I read it.

56:48.540 --> 56:49.700
And that's where I got that.

56:49.700 --> 56:51.060
So he got that in the schools.

56:51.060 --> 56:52.300
Yeah, so I just wanted to tell you.

56:52.300 --> 56:56.460
So Haas Child had an incredibly deleterious impact

56:56.460 --> 56:59.780
on our understanding of the Congo Free State with his book,

56:59.780 --> 57:03.140
King Leopold's Ghost, 1998.

57:03.140 --> 57:08.020
So the way I, so here's the facts about the Congo Free State

57:08.020 --> 57:12.500
is it was an ungoverned and ungovernable part of Africa

57:12.500 --> 57:14.900
that none of the colonial powers could enter.

57:14.900 --> 57:19.060
Because A, the mortality rates were about 20% per year

57:19.060 --> 57:23.660
for a European there because of disease and climate.

57:23.660 --> 57:27.020
Slave trading and inter-tribal warfare was rampant.

57:27.020 --> 57:29.980
Even the British could not stop the slave trading

57:29.980 --> 57:31.180
in the central Congo.

57:31.180 --> 57:33.420
Those slaves were taken to Eastern Africa

57:33.420 --> 57:34.980
and onto the Arab area.

57:34.980 --> 57:36.980
So this is the East African slave trade run

57:36.980 --> 57:40.140
by the Arabs and the Indians.

57:40.140 --> 57:45.140
And King Leopold said, let me try to establish

57:45.340 --> 57:46.820
at least some trading stations

57:46.820 --> 57:48.220
and some navigable rivers there.

57:48.220 --> 57:50.460
That was the deal, okay?

57:50.460 --> 57:55.460
Now, King Leopold's Congo managed to create a railway

57:57.060 --> 57:59.740
up into the central part of the country

57:59.740 --> 58:01.980
and certain amount of stability

58:01.980 --> 58:06.620
by stopping slave trading and inter-tribal warfare

58:06.620 --> 58:09.420
with a very thin amount of people, very few, right?

58:09.420 --> 58:11.180
It's still vastly unexplored.

58:11.180 --> 58:13.900
And as a result of that population,

58:13.900 --> 58:16.460
probably slightly increased,

58:16.460 --> 58:18.860
maybe there was a decrease because of the rise

58:18.860 --> 58:20.980
of sleeping sickness and some endemic diseases

58:20.980 --> 58:21.980
that were coming in.

58:21.980 --> 58:24.660
But basically, it was an amazingly positive contribution

58:24.660 --> 58:25.620
to the people of the Congo.

58:25.620 --> 58:29.100
Now, in a very small part, about 10% of that territory,

58:29.100 --> 58:32.940
they grew rubber and instead of forced labor requirements,

58:32.940 --> 58:34.540
they imposed rubber quotas.

58:34.540 --> 58:36.500
So, you know, when you're running a government,

58:36.500 --> 58:37.940
you need to pay for the government.

58:37.940 --> 58:39.500
There's three ways to do it.

58:39.500 --> 58:40.700
You can tax people,

58:40.700 --> 58:43.860
but if they have no money, taxation's not feasible.

58:43.860 --> 58:46.860
Most common way to use it then is forced labor, right?

58:46.860 --> 58:47.860
It's called Corvée labor.

58:47.860 --> 58:50.660
You pay your taxes in terms of labor.

58:50.660 --> 58:54.180
In the rubber areas, the labor was demanded

58:54.180 --> 58:56.500
in terms of the delivery of rubber quotas

58:56.500 --> 58:58.100
from different villages.

58:58.100 --> 59:01.580
Now, in most of these areas, the rubber came very easily.

59:01.580 --> 59:04.260
In other parts of these rubber areas,

59:04.260 --> 59:07.300
the local militias who were hired

59:07.300 --> 59:11.100
by the Belgian rubber companies engaged

59:11.100 --> 59:14.980
in coercive practices to get the locals to bring in the rubber.

59:14.980 --> 59:17.340
And there were some atrocities, for sure.

59:17.340 --> 59:22.340
I estimate maybe 10,000 Belgian black Congolese died

59:23.140 --> 59:25.660
in skirmishers or conflicts

59:25.660 --> 59:29.220
between the Belgian rubber companies.

59:29.220 --> 59:30.900
Now, don't forget, these are black militias,

59:30.900 --> 59:32.140
but it's black on black conflict.

59:32.140 --> 59:36.660
Nonetheless, the rubber companies and the local, 10,000.

59:36.660 --> 59:38.220
Terrible number, but don't forget,

59:38.220 --> 59:41.260
we're talking about a country of 10 million at this point.

59:41.260 --> 59:42.780
And that is the worst of it.

59:42.780 --> 59:46.060
All those pictures you see of severed limbs are either fake,

59:46.060 --> 59:49.860
meaning those are people who had their hands cut off

59:49.860 --> 59:51.260
because of gangrene

59:51.260 --> 59:54.260
or because they had their hands cut off in battles

59:54.260 --> 59:58.180
or when you see them holding the hands of people,

59:58.180 --> 01:00:00.820
that's because it was tribal custom in Congo.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.700
When you were issued a rifle with 10 bullets,

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.940
if you came back with only eight bullets,

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:07.820
you needed to show that those two bullets

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.620
had been used to kill others.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:12.180
And you would cut their hands off and the hands had showed,

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:15.140
and this was typically soldier on soldier conflict,

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:18.540
not against villagers who didn't turn in their rubber quotas.

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:22.020
So the British Congo reformers realized

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.820
that if they could show some pictures of people

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.900
with severed hands and say this is King Leopold's

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.220
rubber minions, that it would spark outrage,

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.340
because what they really wanted

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:31.060
was the Brits to colonize the Congo.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.620
And it did some, it created a movement in support of this,

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.780
but a vast amount of lies and propaganda,

01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:39.380
which Adam Hochschild repeats in his book,

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:42.980
says that 10 million people died from the British,

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:45.700
from the Belgian Congolese, not the Belgian King Leopold's

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.900
Congolese rubber operations, complete nonsense.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.540
And how do we know that figure is wrong?

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:53.780
Because demographers in the 70s, 80s and 90s

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:56.580
started to go back and do the data calculations.

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:57.900
1970s, 80s and 90s.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.500
Yeah, mainly the 80s and 90s is when they finally

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.020
got good enough evidence.

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:06.100
And demographers estimating population,

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.500
it shows the population is basically flat the whole time.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.260
Because despite the downward pressure on population

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:14.420
caused by endemic disease, King Leopold's Congo

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:18.540
was maintaining stability, food supplies were rising,

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.580
slave operations were declining.

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:23.460
So his contribution was very positive.

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:25.340
There was a negative countervailing effect

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:28.020
from endemic disease, which was coming in.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:30.620
And the net result was basically a flat population.

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:33.980
Well, OK, that's fascinating, because that totally upends.

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:34.660
Totally different.

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:38.100
I mean, and if you try to go on Wikipedia, and correct.

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:39.340
Well, Wikipedia is a corrupt system.

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:43.380
Yeah, if you try and correct any of those fake facts

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.660
on Wikipedia, you'll get immediately edited out.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.540
Which I don't do, because I know it's going to happen.

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:49.860
But friends of mine who do this say that they

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:51.260
keep trying to indicate.

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:52.700
OK, now, so that's another.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:54.820
The corruption of Wikipedia is another story.

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:56.700
That's a totally, I don't want to go on the road,

01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:57.900
Wikipedia is corrupt.

01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.860
OK, so.

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:03.660
But just imagine how pernicious a myth that

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:07.260
is of, because it often gets raised in this debate, right?

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:09.060
Well, what about the Congo?

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:09.540
Yeah.

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:11.100
You know, wasn't the Congo terrible?

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:12.020
That's what I was thinking.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.340
Yeah, no, it wasn't actually.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.180
It was amazingly positive.

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:17.580
Black lives mattered to King Leopold.

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:22.300
And he did an amazing thing to support them.

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:24.380
And yet, and just imagine how pernicious.

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.380
Now, I caught Adam Rothschild actually

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:29.100
doctoring a quotation in his book.

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.340
And he recognized he had doctored it.

01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:33.740
And he apologized and said, well, that's good.

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.940
I said, I hope it gets corrected.

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:36.980
Basically, he taken up.

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.620
Oh, that's a good attitude.

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:44.060
Yeah, but I mean, so it's just like I said, A was not A.

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.620
And I'm sorry about that, but it anchored my whole tale.

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:50.220
Maybe he should cancel the book or give a speech.

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.740
He basically took a Belgian official who said,

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.380
I don't think we should be going in and forcing

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:58.700
coercive rubber harvesting because otherwise, we'll

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:02.460
just be like the Arabs who would cut off hands and feet.

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.100
He doctored that quotation to say,

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.540
if we're going to do rubber harvesting,

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:07.900
we're going to have to be cutting off hands and feet.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:11.580
Oh, that's a significant big.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.660
Completely inverted the meeting, right?

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:14.020
Yeah.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.700
And that's how his book operates in my view.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:16.980
And it's a complete verse.

01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:18.740
So one of the things that you said

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:21.820
that was so interesting to me, and again, this

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:25.380
way outside my area of expertise, excuse me,

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:30.100
is that you said, when you think about colonialism,

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.700
you have to think about what the alternative is.

01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:37.340
And people vote with their feet and where do they go?

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:41.500
And so I want you to please talk a little bit about what

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.260
was the alternative and what did you

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.580
mean by people vote with their feet?

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:49.060
Yeah, so the alternative clearly is not

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:52.460
well-governed, stable, prosperous societies.

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:55.460
Nowhere that was colonized was like that.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:58.980
India, which has to take a lot of time in any analysis

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:01.860
because it's two-thirds of the colonial experience

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:05.340
because of the people, was in the midst of the collapse

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.940
of the Mughal dynasty.

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:10.820
And the attempt by Natar Shah of Persia

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:14.660
to replace the Mughal empire with a Persian empire, which

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:16.900
would have been much more bloody and violent.

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:21.980
And these little feudal fiefdoms that

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.820
were left over from the collapse of the Mughal dynasty

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:27.500
were fighting amongst each other.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:30.620
So when the British showed up, the East India Company

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:34.420
in the first instance showed up, started establishing forts

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:37.420
that were essentially trading forts, what do you know?

01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:41.100
Within years, people started moving closer to the fort.

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.100
Why?

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:44.620
Why would they escape the wonderful life

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:50.060
of being a lower caste Hindu under a Maharaja whose job

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.300
was to pick up the shit of the Hindu elites

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.580
for the rest of your life and all of your generations to come?

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:57.140
Why on earth would you go and live near the British East

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.420
India Company's fort?

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:01.140
A, you had security.

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.940
B, you had job opportunities.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.300
C, if you were from a lower caste,

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.660
you might work for the British army in a canteen.

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:10.660
Hell, even cleaning their latrines would be better.

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:12.340
Building their forts, you suddenly

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:15.420
escape from social oppression.

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:20.540
You're suddenly going to be in a modern area with access

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:24.060
to technology and running water, maybe,

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.260
because the forts started to expand, right?

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.820
So people were voting with their feet already.

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.420
Once the Indian mutiny happens, which

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:33.500
is actually a small minority of the Indian troops

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.460
of the East India Company, and the British decide

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:38.380
the government has got out of control,

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.220
like this was supposed to be a trading venture.

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:41.700
It's now basically a government.

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:44.460
So they formalize it becomes the government of India.

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:47.740
Then we see this massive influx of Indians

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:51.060
into the most heavily colonized cities, right?

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:55.460
Calcutta, Hyderabad, Bombay, New Delhi.

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:56.300
Because why?

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:59.180
Why are people moving closer to colonialism

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:01.580
if colonialism is so terrible for them?

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:03.700
Shouldn't they be fleeing into the mountains?

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.740
Shouldn't they abandoning the cities?

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.100
No, of course they're not.

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.540
They're moving closer in.

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.820
They're trying to get into the English education systems.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.820
Eventually they're trying to send all their kids to Eaton,

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:15.380
an oxbridge, where they become tenured professors

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:17.420
and denounce colonialism, of course.

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:21.460
But it's the hypocrisy of the anti-colonialists

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:26.660
who don't want to recognize how much their forebears wanted,

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:30.660
sought to be part of, engaged with, benefited from,

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:33.860
and recognize the benefits of the colonial experience

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:37.500
compared to what would have happened otherwise.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.740
See, that's fascinating to me.

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:45.300
What do you make of this fact that in Hong Kong

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.460
during the uprisings a few years ago,

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:50.580
there were flying American flags?

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:51.980
And British flags.

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:54.140
Incorrect, and British flags.

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.940
And it kind of goes...

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.220
Melissa Chen was the person who gave me this idea.

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:01.140
It kind of goes against that narrative.

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:04.140
I think I read something she wrote about that.

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:07.300
It goes against the anti-colonial narrative

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:09.260
where these are people who are colonized

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:13.420
and they're flying American and British flags.

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:15.860
So there is a...

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:19.620
Even to say, as you're the world expert in this,

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:22.660
and you would note that there is a case for colonialism,

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:31.660
even that sets people off in a kind of deranged frenzy.

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:35.500
So even to make that suggestion...

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.740
So is the reason for that, and I'm speculating...

01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:41.140
Tell me if my reasoning is off, my speculation is off.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:45.780
Is the reason for that because they look at...

01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:47.220
It's kind of like Israel in a sense.

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:50.420
They look at Israel as a penetration of Western values.

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:53.300
They look at colonialism as the penetration of Western values.

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:55.740
And they view the West as kind of the wellspring

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:57.140
of all things that are bad.

01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:00.660
Is that the basic oversimplified idea?

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.780
So there is definitely a derangement syndrome going on here.

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.940
I mean, Israel derangement syndrome,

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:07.620
colonialism derangement syndrome,

01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:12.180
which you mentioned the idea and it sets them off

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:16.700
in a kind of a lunatic rage of an inability

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:20.820
to think constructively or dispassionately about an issue.

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:22.620
And to form arguments against it too.

01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:23.820
That's the other part of the syndrome.

01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:26.140
Yeah, or to even be willing to engage

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.380
in the historical evidence or debate.

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:32.580
And I caught out this professor,

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.780
one of those who wrote a long article against me,

01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:38.460
who was a professor, a tenure professor

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:40.220
in African studies and whatnot.

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:43.340
And I basically took his essay

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:45.460
and found that none of the quotations he used

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:47.860
actually said what he said they said.

01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:49.020
Did he publish it?

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:49.860
Yes.

01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:50.940
Where did he publish it?

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:53.460
It was an essay in the Washington Post.

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:54.820
Oh, so it wasn't peer reviewed then?

01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.780
No, no, but I mean, he's a scholar.

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:00.460
He's basically trading on his academic credentials

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:01.940
and saying, well, here's the...

01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:03.820
Yeah, it's actually worse that it's in the Washington Post.

01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:06.340
It's worse, yeah, because he's saying, just trust me,

01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:07.580
I'm an academic.

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:10.420
And here's the quote, here's the citation.

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:13.380
Whoa, go through every single one.

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:14.660
That's not what it says.

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.500
That's not what it says.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.140
And he probably hasn't even read it before.

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:19.060
So what is this telling you?

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:21.380
This is telling you that it's no longer

01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:23.620
an area of academic inquiry,

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:28.220
by which we mean evidence, data, hypothesis,

01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.300
falsification, debate, right?

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:33.060
It's an area of ideology.

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.540
It's an area of totalitarian thinking.

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.860
And so for someone again,

01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:39.620
to step outside of the people,

01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:44.780
elicits a kind of Maoist reaction

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.540
as it did in the Cultural Revolution

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:48.020
and all the other Maoist movements,

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:51.940
which is beat the dog when they fall in the gutter,

01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:53.660
as they say in Chinese, you know?

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:57.220
I mean, this is just an outrage against civilization.

01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:58.340
It's a terrible expression.

01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.180
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:09.300
But again, my normal response is, okay,

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:14.340
here's my long response to all of your critiques.

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:17.740
Sighted, footnoted, double-check my footnotes

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.300
if you think what I'm saying,

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.900
the evidence I'm citing doesn't say that,

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:25.060
please write a rebuttal, you know, 20,000 words later.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:29.020
What do all those people say in response?

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:30.660
Nada.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:34.500
Because it's not really an academic topic anymore, right?

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:38.700
And to even say all of your evidence

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:43.700
that you've mustered against me is like tofu construction,

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:45.140
another Chinese phrase.

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:50.300
For them it's like saying Claudia Gay plagiarized.

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:54.220
Even to raise that white Eurocentric perspective

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.420
is just evidence of your white supremacy.

01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:58.140
You don't get it.

01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:59.380
The ship has sailed.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:01.460
The ideology is correct.

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:03.580
If you didn't get on board with the ideology

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:07.260
and you keep raising these old liberal shibboleths against it,

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:10.940
it just shows how deeply entrenched the problems are in you,

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:12.060
not me.

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.660
Yeah, it's disparaging

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:17.340
because that's the dominant moral orthodoxy right now.

01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:20.380
That's currently what's in fashion.

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:21.860
And it's not as if,

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:27.700
it's not only as if a certain conclusion was orthodox,

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.940
it's a process to get to the conclusion.

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.260
It's the demeaning of evidence.

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.060
It's the demeaning of reason.

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:38.380
It's the wholesale writing off of datasets.

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:41.980
And so that makes the problem much more difficult to solve.

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:44.780
It's not like, well, we know the earth is warming

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:46.380
or anthropogenic warming, et cetera.

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:47.260
So what do we do about it?

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:49.740
Those are political considerations based upon dataset.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.580
It's you just wipe out the whole dataset.

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:53.580
So then you're in, la la la.

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:54.980
Because what are you interested in?

01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:55.980
Truth or power?

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:56.900
Correct, right?

01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:58.860
If you're interested in truth,

01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.500
you're constantly trying to revise,

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:01.420
are we doing this right?

01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:02.580
What's the evidence?

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.260
If you're interested in power,

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:06.220
the truth question doesn't come into it.

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:11.220
What ideology will be effective as a tool of us gaining

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:13.140
and maintaining and using power?

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.420
That's the question, right?

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:19.420
So anti-colonialism then became decolonization,

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.940
then became post-colonialism.

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:23.980
All of these things, it turns out,

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.020
had nothing to do with truth.

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:28.140
They were ideologies of power.

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:30.180
First, they were ideologies of power

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:31.620
for the people in the colonies

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.980
who wanted to take over from the colonial rulers.

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:35.260
They'd sit there, look at government houses,

01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.220
saying, wow, it'd be great to sleep there.

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:38.940
Sit there and sip whiskies all day,

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:40.100
and I'd be served upon.

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:41.980
I'd probably retain some of those white staff

01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:44.380
so I could be served by a white staff member.

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.820
I mean, the people would go crazy

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:47.900
to see a black man served by a white man.

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:53.900
Then decolonization, which was taking these societies

01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:58.060
that had a rule of law, a court system, a high court,

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:01.980
property rights, guaranteed freedoms,

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:03.820
a meritocratic education system.

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:07.020
Decolonize went, I'm taking all that over.

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:09.340
I'm nationalizing the cocoa industry.

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:12.500
I'm suspending the habeas corpus.

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.260
I'm seizing property, right?

01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:15.620
That was decolonization.

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:19.780
It was not an ideology of public policy.

01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:22.580
It was an ideology of power and resources.

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:23.420
Fascinating.

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:25.260
And then post-colonialism became the same thing.

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:27.380
Post-colonialism was to say,

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:31.860
we cannot use the rational European way

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:33.700
of thinking about the world.

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:36.740
We can't expect brown and black people to think that way.

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:39.380
We need to adopt a post-colonial perspective

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:41.700
so that we don't hold them to those same standards.

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.780
This is a properly post-colonial view

01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:45.620
on what you should have

01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:47.380
in order to be the president of Harvard.

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:51.420
Claudine Gay perfectly fits that post-colonial perspective.

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:56.180
She wasn't elevated on merit or metrics or competence.

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:58.780
That's the colonial mindset we need to decolonize.

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:01.180
And we need to have a post-colonial Harvard president.

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:02.220
And she was it.

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:06.100
And she was glamorous and perfect post-colonialism at Harvard.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.620
It's been decolonized.

01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:09.340
And there it is in its full glory.

01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:10.660
And that's what you get.

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.780
Yeah, I actually agree with them.

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:14.460
I was really disappointed.

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:17.420
I mean, Claudine Gay is the president Harvard deserves.

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:21.380
And I was very much disappointed when she resigned.

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:24.260
I think I was genuinely she's the president.

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:25.900
She's a perfect fit for the university.

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:26.740
I couldn't agree.

01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:27.580
Perfect fit.

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:28.420
I couldn't agree more.

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.260
She's keeping her knowledge.

01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:32.140
It is the modern decolonized anti-racist university.

01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:35.660
And I could show you 100 institutes

01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:37.500
of higher education in the third world

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.780
that went through exactly that process

01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:41.540
after the end of the colonial era.

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:44.420
And the presidency was seized by some party

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:47.220
hack who could barely spell his name.

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:50.820
And the research departments were given to party hacks

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.300
who were not the best in their field.

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.700
I mean, this was the Soviet Union, right?

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:56.140
We're all, I mean, the Soviet Union,

01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:59.580
the Russian scientific and mathematical tradition

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:02.460
used to be unparalleled, top in the world, right?

01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:03.820
Until the Soviet Union.

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:07.700
And all that academic excellence was replaced by ideology.

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:10.100
So what it took to be the head of the university was

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:12.180
you had to be a good party cadre.

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:14.740
What it took to be the head of the agronomics department

01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.220
was you believed in some quack theory

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:19.080
that some party hack had invented

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.980
and that was the only route to the top.

01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:27.140
So it seems that, well, two things.

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:32.020
Why should someone read the case for colonialism?

01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:33.980
So I start with that one.

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.420
Yeah, so I think the book brings together

01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:40.260
the logical evidence-based arguments.

01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:45.260
And it does so not in the sort of thematic chapter by chapter,

01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:48.620
but using what I call episodes of colonialism.

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:50.180
So I look at specific cases.

01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:51.660
I look at Malaya.

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.220
I look at Yemen.

01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.260
I look at India.

01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:56.260
I look at the Congo.

01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:58.580
I look at German colonies.

01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:02.740
I look at specific instances where colonialism took place

01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:07.980
because I find it a lot easier to deal with instances,

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.940
places rather than themes.

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.620
I think it's more accessible.

01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:16.620
So, and then it's forwarded by the broad thematic arguments.

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:20.740
And at the end, I bring in responses to colonialism

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:22.820
from two of the great third world intellectuals,

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:26.260
Chinua Kebei, which was the article I published,

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:29.780
expanded, revised, and then one on V.S. Nipal,

01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:33.060
who's the Nobel Laureate writer from Trinidad.

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.580
His book blew me away.

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:36.620
Who was, to me, one of the greatest writers

01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:37.460
of the 20th century.

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:38.300
Yeah, totally blew my life.

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.700
And was only very reluctantly given the Nobel Prize

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:42.260
because at a certain point,

01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:45.300
even the woke Nobel committee could not ignore

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.060
this man's greatness.

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:48.980
And they tried to spin him as an anticolonial writer,

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:49.820
which he wasn't.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:54.500
So I think if you want to kind of,

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.660
and here's what I would say about my book.

01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:58.260
I'm not an, on the one hand,

01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:00.100
on the other hand, type of person.

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:03.940
I think colonialism was an unmitigated good.

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:07.780
That doesn't mean during this entire period of colonialism,

01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.340
a lot of bad stuff didn't happen.

01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:10.180
Of course it did.

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.100
We're talking about human societies.

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:13.500
If there was not bad stuff,

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.020
it wouldn't be a human society.

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:20.020
What I mean was at the level of the general systemic factors

01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:23.700
that brought colonialism to being and how it operated

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.220
and what it left behind,

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.060
all of that unmitigated good, okay?

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.420
So, and I think that's what distinguishes my book

01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:32.740
from my colleague Nigel Bigger's book,

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:34.740
Colonials and Memorial Reckoning.

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:36.580
Fantastic book.

01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:38.420
Dr. Bigger, on the other hand,

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:42.340
trying very hard to be that terrible tick

01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:45.540
in the British personality, reasonable, dear fellow.

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:47.500
Reasonable, right?

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.980
And he is reasonable.

01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:52.660
And so he does try to give more fair play

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:54.620
to critical arguments.

01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:59.220
I just think he's trying a bit too hard to be reasonable

01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:02.700
in that British manner of not to sure about anything,

01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:05.860
very practical, you know, I call this the hobbit mentality

01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:08.980
of like, no adventures and no big theories.

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.420
So I respect him a lot,

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:13.180
but it's really not an argument for colonialism his book is.

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:15.860
It's more of a introduction to the debate.

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:18.140
Mine is the only, and I would say the same

01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:19.740
about Nigel Ferguson's book, Empire.

01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:20.940
Oh, I love that book.

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.780
Which is great, which is fantastic

01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:25.580
because he really does bring in a lot of the detail.

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.980
He also has a kind of thematic introduction.

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:29.220
I have a signed copy of that.

01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:32.140
The five, whatever he calls them, the five super apps

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.740
of Western civilization, property rights, markets,

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:36.220
you know, whatever.

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:38.900
But Ferguson's also one of those too clever by,

01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:41.620
what they call too clever by half in the UK, right?

01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:42.940
He's a brilliant guy, right?

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:45.940
And he's so brilliant that he can't help

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:48.100
but throwing in all kinds of little insults

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.940
and nastinesses about British colonialism

01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:54.060
because to be a real intellectual

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:56.100
in the British tradition, like bigger,

01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:57.220
need to be balanced, right?

01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:59.100
Need to be on the one hand on the other hand.

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.340
Although his general argument is colonialism was great

01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:04.220
and British Empire created the modern world.

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:06.940
Both of them in my mind are a little bit too much of a um,

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.900
um, on the one hand on the other hand.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:11.020
So if you want a book that simply says,

01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.820
here's the case and here's the evidence

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:15.140
and here's why I disagree with these arguments against it.

01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:16.660
Mine's the only one.

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:18.820
All right, that's fascinating.

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:21.180
So, so let me ask you this.

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:25.380
You are in the twilight of your career,

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:27.620
would you say that's fair to say?

01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:28.460
Yes.

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:32.180
And you were approximately the same age

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:35.500
and you're going on sabbatical next term.

01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.500
You're at an institution

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.860
where the vast majority of people despise you.

01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:43.060
Is that fair to say?

01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:45.260
Yeah, I think so.

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:47.300
At least in the humanities and social sciences.

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:48.140
Sure, sure.

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:53.780
So what's next for you?

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:57.340
I mean, what's next for you?

01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:02.220
Well, I think there's always this dilemma of

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:06.860
when do you leave a sinking ship?

01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.020
And I answered that question.

01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:11.860
You answered that question.

01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:14.500
And I don't mean Portland State is sinking.

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:15.620
It's a state institution.

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:17.180
It'll survive in one form or another.

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.780
But what I mean is if the intellectual environment

01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:21.460
is sinking, it disappeared.

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:22.620
It's sunk.

01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:24.220
Then what point do you abandon

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:29.220
or what point do you say they should triple my salary?

01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:30.900
I'm the only thing.

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:31.740
Correct.

01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:34.260
One of the only things keeping this place

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:36.660
to some degree intellectually honest.

01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:41.300
So to what extent do you say I gotta stay?

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:44.340
Not because I care about the institution itself per se,

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:47.700
but because anywhere else I went, right,

01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.300
any other university would have some degree

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.220
of the same problems.

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:51.380
And the extent that it didn't,

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:54.100
I would say, well, I'm just replicating what's,

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:55.620
I mean, if there were a place

01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.700
like the Stanford Business School,

01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:01.100
which has created a vigorous classical liberalism series,

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:02.220
of course, it's in the business school,

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:04.420
not the film school,

01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:07.460
you would say, well, the work's already been done here.

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:09.500
The problem, as I see it is,

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:10.900
the problem with you staying there,

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.740
it kind of legitimizes them when they don't deserve it.

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:15.780
Right?

01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:17.500
I mean, have you thought about the idea that,

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.700
and I'm just totally tossing it out there,

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:20.780
like the University of Austin

01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:23.060
is gonna do a debate and speaker series.

01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.780
I think you'd be a fantastic person.

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:27.500
I think you could go on the road and debate this,

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:30.420
and I think you'd draw huge audiences.

01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:31.660
Also though, keep in mind,

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:34.220
and you will know this too, from being in the classroom,

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:35.420
is there's a huge difference

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:37.660
between the students and the faculty.

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:39.220
Oh, absolutely, right, 100%.

01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:40.860
Students, even the students

01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:44.140
who ultimately are very woke, very left wing,

01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:45.580
they're still curious.

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:47.020
They still wanna listen.

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.780
They still wanna hear from you.

01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:52.060
They still wanna have a discussion after class.

01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:57.060
They actually, so what is the experience

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:01.580
as a faculty member in an American woke University?

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:05.180
Well, it's true that your experience with your colleagues

01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:06.380
is a big part of it,

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:07.860
because you're working together with them,

01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:09.020
and they shape the environment,

01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:10.940
and they pass resolutions against you.

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:11.780
But on the other hand,

01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:12.620
your experience with the students

01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:16.340
is also a big part of what you're living through,

01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:18.460
and I love my students,

01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:20.140
and I love being in the classroom with them,

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:23.380
and I find them very open-minded and curious

01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:25.340
and interested to hear different perspectives.

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:28.980
And the fact that they would go to your class at all

01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:32.340
would probably mean that either like you or they hate you,

01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:34.020
but almost no one would have heard of it.

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.900
Right, they get to select, right?

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:38.620
So if they're really opposed, they just won't come,

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.340
but a lot of them do,

01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:43.660
and the only problem students I ever have

01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:45.580
are actually the graduate students

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:49.340
who have decided they're on the side of justice

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:52.100
and they're marching for the revolution.

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:53.740
I quote one of them in my book,

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:56.660
a guy who was going on to do a PhD

01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:59.140
and was saying that I have to make clarifying remarks

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:02.820
in my letters that I in no way was in solidarity

01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:04.540
with Dr. Gilley.

01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:07.620
You can tell by the language where he was coming from,

01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:09.060
but he's the outlier.

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:13.020
I mean, the students, which is ultimately, you know,

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:16.220
in terms of your daily experience,

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:18.420
shapes your daily experience,

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:19.700
I have no problem with my students,

01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:21.420
and they have no problem with me.

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:23.660
So what's next for you?

01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:24.660
What are you gonna do?

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:27.860
Well, I think partly we're all waiting to see

01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:30.140
what happens to higher education in the next year.

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.580
Well, we know what's gonna happen.

01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:34.020
Well, maybe we do, maybe we don't.

01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:38.300
I think there has to be a reckoning,

01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:39.940
especially now.

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:43.260
It's not just the Claudine Gay question

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:47.380
and the DEI bans that some states are passing.

01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:50.980
And it's not also, it's not only the plagiarism questions.

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:54.100
And plagiarism, it's also the enrollment decline.

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:58.300
It's the demographic cusp, cliff.

01:23:58.300 --> 01:23:59.700
They call it the demographic cliff

01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:01.500
that they're all about to fall off.

01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:05.180
It's the donors, it's the funding, right?

01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:06.580
It's the college debt.

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:08.020
I mean, it's all of that,

01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:11.540
which has to lead to some reformulation of the university.

01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:13.700
And then the question is,

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:16.100
what's the business model going forward?

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:20.820
Because we know that universities thrive

01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:22.340
when they get the best students, right?

01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:24.420
Because universities are basically,

01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:28.660
they live off their signaling, right?

01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:30.860
The reason they hire great faculty

01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:33.220
is not because those faculty know how to teach.

01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.700
Often they're terrible teachers.

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:39.140
And the reason they love getting great students

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.860
is not necessarily because those students

01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:43.220
are the most socially minded and positive,

01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:46.700
but because everyone wants to go somewhere

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:48.420
where there's a bunch of smart people, right?

01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:50.300
That's the university brand,

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:53.660
is we're taking you to a new level when you come here,

01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:56.060
surrounded by smart people on campus

01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:57.340
that you can learn from.

01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:00.500
So to the extent that someone like Claudine,

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.020
think of the damage of a Claudine Gay case

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:05.180
against the Harvard brand, right?

01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:09.140
Your president is not only academically incompetent

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:11.940
and administratively stupid, but she's a plagiarist, right?

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.100
11 citations.

01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:16.460
Yeah, I mean, it's just amazing damage to the brand

01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:19.740
in terms of what universities are supposed to offer to students.

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.420
And we're gonna keep wrong faculty.

01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:22.540
Correct me if I'm wrong,

01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:25.300
and I'm pretty sure this is the case, but I'm not positive.

01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:28.420
I read the metrics of Portland State

01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:31.340
accepts 98% of its applicants.

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:34.660
98%, so how intellectually rigorous could it possibly be

01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:36.700
when they only reject 2%?

01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:39.500
Like anyone with a pulse should be able to get in there.

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:40.980
Yeah, so admission is easy, right?

01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:43.260
So you're talking about the bottom of the ladder.

01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:45.740
The bottom of the bottom of the barrel.

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.660
Of course, you still have to pass classes, right?

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:49.540
You still have to succeed.

01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:51.500
And there's some debate about

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.180
whether that's even very difficult anymore.

01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:56.060
But as you move up in the ecosystem.

01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:57.940
The average grade, I think in some places,

01:25:57.940 --> 01:25:59.380
I remember I looked into this a while ago,

01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:03.060
it's a, when I did my dissertation,

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:07.460
I think it was A minus in, I'm not sure,

01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.940
but I think it's in the A minus is the average range.

01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:12.620
It varies obviously by college and department.

01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:14.300
Think philosophy is a little lower than that.

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:17.740
But so anybody, almost anybody can get in.

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:19.140
I wonder who those 2% are.

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.340
Like literally they must, I just can't even imagine.

01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:23.660
And then once you get in, you kind of sail.

01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:26.340
Like I think the average grade of Harvard now is an A.

01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:27.940
So like once you get in, you're sailing.

01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:32.260
But keep in mind what colleges and universities

01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:35.260
should be judged upon is the value added.

01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:37.420
They provide to students, right?

01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:40.780
So last time I looked at the data

01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:43.060
for a university like Portland State,

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:45.740
it was actually doing pretty good about average,

01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:47.540
adding value to its students.

01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:49.300
In other words, the SAT and then this.

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:50.820
Yeah, yeah, you look at their trajectory

01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:51.900
coming out of high school.

01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:53.140
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:56.100
And where a typical American will end up earning twice

01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:57.740
with that kind of trajectory.

01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:01.020
The universities can deflate it or inflate it, right?

01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:02.860
If they add value, what they say is

01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:05.460
they take someone who barely graduated high school,

01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:08.820
has very little confidence in their intellectual abilities,

01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:10.900
never really learn to write.

01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:12.940
Portland State or a place like Portland State,

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:16.540
if they're doing a good job, takes them and says, look,

01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:19.740
you can do this, you have an intellectual spark,

01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.900
you need some confidence, you need some writing,

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:23.420
you need to be introduced to reading,

01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:25.980
you need to be introduced to skill-based building.

01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:28.260
And at the end of the day, you are on trajectory

01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:29.940
to be below the poverty line.

01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:32.220
You're now in the middle class, okay?

01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:33.060
Whereas a Harvard-

01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:34.140
That's good, that's a great accomplishment.

01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:37.020
Yeah, whereas a Harvard might take a high flyer

01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:39.860
who should have a mansion at Martha's Vineyard

01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:44.660
and turn them into a down and out computer programmer

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:49.140
in Scranton, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:51.900
because they took away value

01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:54.340
by telling them they should get involved in this

01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:56.540
or saying skills don't matter or whatever.

01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:59.140
So universities, of course,

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:00.380
they serve different populations.

01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:02.980
The real metric of a university is the value added,

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:05.660
what they do to you compared to where you were heading

01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:06.500
otherwise.

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:07.500
Yeah.

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.380
And I think, well, last time I checked,

01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:10.900
Portland State was doing okay, but I mean,

01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.300
that's the metric and like I say,

01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:15.500
the liberal arts colleges are the worst in America

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.460
for value added because they detract value.

01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:19.820
Yeah, that hurtens me because I, like you,

01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:20.700
I love my students.

01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:23.780
I thought the overwhelming majority were fantastic

01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:26.620
and they were eager and they were thoughtful.

01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:28.660
And yes, I definitely had students

01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:30.700
and I'm not gonna downplay this.

01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.220
You know, I don't know what percentage

01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.260
who came in wanting to hate me for sure,

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:35.940
but they came in and they took the class

01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:37.540
and my hats off to them.

01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:42.460
And so my student experience was overwhelmingly positive

01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:44.580
and so it's heartening to hear that.

01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:48.340
Well, Bruce, you've been very generous with your time.

01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:50.580
The case for colonialism.

01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:53.020
I wish you seriously the best of luck,

01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:54.540
not only in the sale of the book

01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:57.220
and getting those ideas out there,

01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:00.580
but I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.

01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:03.540
I genuinely believe that the university

01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:04.500
is not gonna do well,

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.700
but people like you will do extraordinarily well.

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:07.780
Thanks, it's been great to be here.

01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:08.620
Yeah, my pleasure.

01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:09.820
Thank you, Alex.

01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:11.260
Thank you for watching.
