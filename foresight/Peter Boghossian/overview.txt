Checking Peter Boghossian/“The Case For Colonialism：” What DEI Gets WRONG ｜ Peter Boghossian & Bruce Gilley.txt
 Bruce Gilley, the author of "The Case for Colonialism," discussed the concept of value added by universities in terms of student outcomes versus entering credentials (like SAT scores). He argues that universities should be judged on how much they enhance a student's life and potential earnings, not just on their admission criteria. Gilley believes that many universities, particularly liberal arts colleges, do not add significant value to their students' lives, which can lead to negative outcomes for the graduates.

Alex is sympathetic to Bruce's perspective on the importance of universities adding real value to their students' lives. He emphasizes that while individual experiences at universities may vary and are often positive, it's crucial to consider the broader impact of these institutions on society. Alex wishes Bruce well with his book sales and future endeavors, acknowledging that individuals like Bruce who challenge ideas and provoke discussion play a valuable role in the academic community.

The conversation also touches on the idea that getting into college has become more accessible, with average grades for admission often being high, and the average grade in higher education being an A. Alex mentions that Portland State University is doing a reasonably good job of adding value to its students' lives, which is a key metric for measuring the success of universities. The discussion concludes with a call to action for viewers to support the National Progress Alliance, a non-profit organization that produces content like this video, through donations.
