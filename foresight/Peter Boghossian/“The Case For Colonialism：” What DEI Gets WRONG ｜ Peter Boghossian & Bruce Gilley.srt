1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
But just imagine how pernicious a myth that is of,

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,440
because it often gets raised in this debate, right?

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,160
Well, what about the Congo?

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,280
You know, wasn't the Congo terrible?

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,120
That's what I was thinking.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,480
Yeah, no, it wasn't, actually.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,320
It was amazingly positive.

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,680
Black Lives Mattered to King Leopold,

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,980
and he did an amazing thing to support them.

11
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,700
Welcome to Conversations with Peter Burgosian.

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,620
Today we will have a conversation with Dr. Bruce Gilley.

13
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,020
He's a professor at Portland State University.

14
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,820
I hope you enjoy the conversation.

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,660
Thank you.

16
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,900
Dr. Bruce Gilley, it is an honor to talk to you today.

17
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,380
We're going to talk about your fantastic new book,

18
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,060
The Case for Colonialism.

19
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,380
But before we do that,

20
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,980
we have a lot of other things to talk about.

21
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,060
You are now the most hated man in Portland State University.

22
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,020
Oh, no, that's undervaluing my hatred.

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,220
I think I'm the most hated man

24
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,580
in the Western United States, at least.

25
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,780
So people are very upset with you,

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,140
and I remember you were very kind,

27
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,380
and you took a lot of time to explain,

28
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,740
so we went out to lunch,

29
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,140
and you took time to explain to my son and I

30
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,700
about colonialism, and I definitely want to talk about that.

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,140
But before we talk about that,

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,180
we have some,

33
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,060
issues of the day that we need to talk about,

34
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,300
specifically the plagiarism scandal.

35
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,500
So before I go into it,

36
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,260
do you have any brief thoughts on it,

37
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,900
the caught-in-gay and DEI plagiarism scandals?

38
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,740
Well, I think it ultimately all comes back to the same thing,

39
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,660
which is higher education,

40
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,620
maybe general intellectual life as a whole,

41
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,620
has always been political, right?

42
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,260
So you say that there's a lot of political issues

43
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,580
that are going to be raised,

44
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,740
but it's always been political, right?

45
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,180
So you say that this art's political,

46
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,700
or that writing that guy's book is political, fine.

47
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,500
It's always been political in some sense.

48
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,780
You can have standards of logic or evidence and stuff,

49
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,660
but saying that someone's political.

50
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,900
But I think what happened,

51
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,220
which people only now realize really,

52
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,380
is some of these fields, if not all of them,

53
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,980
especially the studies fields, stopped being political.

54
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,660
Political meaning a situation

55
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,620
where people can have different points of view,

56
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,660
even though they take points of view,

57
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,340
and they became totalitarian.

58
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,180
Correct.

59
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,380
Which means there is no possibility

60
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,740
of having more than one point of view.

61
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,820
Once a field becomes totalitarian,

62
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,900
i.e. once it loses the debate

63
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,780
that marks a political situation,

64
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,060
thinking itself becomes degraded,

65
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,420
because why would you try and think different thoughts?

66
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,100
Your whole job is to find a script and to follow it,

67
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,980
and the logical conclusion of that

68
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,940
is to actually start to recite it, to repeat it.

69
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,580
Like Marxist ideological training.

70
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,540
To plagiarize it, but it's not plagiarism,

71
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,420
because as a good party member,

72
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,980
you're repeating the mantras of the master.

73
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,740
You are citing the key phrases.

74
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,940
You are showing how history all can be understood

75
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,900
through this master narrative,

76
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,700
which in the case of the DEI, or the Black Studies people,

77
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,980
is the oppression of black people in structural racism.

78
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,820
We know that.

79
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,100
In some ways, people having this kind of

80
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,940
neo-victorian response,

81
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,380
oh dear, plagiarism is silly,

82
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,700
because of course she plagiarizes,

83
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,980
because plagiarism is all about a totalitarian mindset

84
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,740
of following the master and repeating the mantras

85
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,540
and adhering to the principles.

86
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,380
That's so interesting.

87
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,340
And we should have known all along

88
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,180
that these DEI diversity recruits and appointments

89
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,860
were gonna be full of plagiarism,

90
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,180
because in a communist or a totalitarian mindset,

91
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,500
that's not called plagiarism.

92
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,940
It's called towing the line.

93
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,180
That's so interesting.

94
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,180
I never thought about it from that perspective before.

95
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,540
So by the time we release this,

96
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,100
and I'm confident that I can say this now,

97
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,500
we have found many people who have plagiarized

98
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,940
at the highest levels.

99
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,020
So that doesn't surprise you.

100
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,460
Of course you have, and it's the tip of the iceberg.

101
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,540
And once we start running these papers

102
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,220
they've submitted and published through the fact checker,

103
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,220
the plagiarizer, the AI enhanced plagiarism detector,

104
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,700
we're gonna see, just as if I had taken

105
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,060
a bunch of papers from Marxist in China

106
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,700
and run them through the plagiarism checker,

107
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,380
of course I'd find all they do is plagiarize

108
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,900
their mentors, their party leaders,

109
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,420
the great leaders, the great speeches, right?

110
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,740
Because that's what totalitarianism does,

111
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,220
is it creates a script.

112
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,100
And you're expected to memorize it and repeat it.

113
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,780
It's not called plagiarism.

114
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,340
And so to say a charge of plagiarism

115
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,540
against someone like Claudine Gaye

116
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,460
is rather like charging a party member

117
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,420
in the Soviet Union of quoting Marx.

118
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,140
Of course I quoted Marx.

119
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,020
I did it as much as possible.

120
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,260
It's not plagiarism.

121
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,300
I just learned the lingo and the phrase.

122
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,140
So let me ask you a question.

123
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,300
I cannot, I sincerely cannot for the life of me figure it out.

124
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,300
Maybe you can help me figure this out.

125
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,900
Okay, so she kept her salary of $900,000 a year

126
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,380
and it's a private institution.

127
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,340
They do take federal funding though,

128
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,420
but it's a private institution.

129
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,740
Do you do anything you want as a private institution?

130
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,780
You want to double her salary?

131
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,980
That's your business.

132
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,500
It's none of my concern.

133
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,580
But and she's now faculty.

134
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,660
So she's back in her faculty.

135
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,220
She's been removed from the administration.

136
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,220
So you need to please help me understand two things.

137
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,620
And I'm very sincere when I say this.

138
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,860
Why isn't she kicked out of the university?

139
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,860
But even more so when your paper came out

140
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,780
in Third World Quarterly,

141
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,500
people, there was a petition I remember

142
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,860
that went around saying that they wanted your PhD.

143
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,700
Revoked.

144
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,540
Revoked.

145
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,900
They wanted your PhD for an article

146
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,900
that you made an argument for a position.

147
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,340
Like, and people are of course free to disagree.

148
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,580
That's what we, that's what,

149
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,180
that's the whole structure that we've said.

150
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,140
That's the coin of the realm.

151
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,900
Disagreement, publishing and that's great.

152
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,380
Fine, wonderful, fantastic.

153
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,580
But they wanted your PhD from that.

154
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,340
But this woman is a serial plagiarist.

155
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,140
We know that for a fact.

156
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,060
So please help me explain one,

157
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,940
why she is still faculty.

158
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,660
And two, why hasn't she,

159
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,980
why is her PhD not revoked?

160
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,740
Because she's part of the people.

161
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,380
The people, the communists used to call those

162
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,140
who told the party line

163
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,100
and were good members of society or the party,

164
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,620
the people, i.e. they're on the inside.

165
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,620
And even though reactionary forces may take them down,

166
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,020
they're still part of the people.

167
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,620
So of course they're their kid.

168
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,180
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if they promote her

169
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,500
in the Department of African Studies

170
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,620
because she's done exactly what she should do.

171
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,540
She's used her color to seize power.

172
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,060
She's then used her power

173
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,540
to promote the totalitarian ideology of DEI.

174
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,460
And then when she's been found to have copied

175
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,460
and repeated and propagated the ideology of the masters

176
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,560
and ousted by reactionary forces,

177
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,860
she has gone down saying, I'm a victim of racism.

178
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,760
So not only is she back in place,

179
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,420
she should be given a raise.

180
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,380
She should be promoted.

181
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,980
She is the most loyal party cadre

182
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,820
to the cause of DEI and wokeness

183
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,540
that Harvard has ever seen.

184
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,420
So, you know, this surprise to me

185
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,420
is they haven't yet announced a salary raise

186
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,540
or an endowed chair for her in African Studies

187
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,300
because she is the model of the good party hack.

188
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,060
Now, I'm exactly the opposite, right?

189
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,420
I'm the white Russian.

190
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,260
I'm the white Russian.

191
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,540
I am the reactionary.

192
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,860
I'm outside of the people.

193
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,940
So when I do something that causes controversy,

194
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,620
which isn't actually plagiarism or calling for genocide,

195
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,100
but it's just part of an article,

196
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,780
of course the reaction to me is, well, that's the gulag for him.

197
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,860
You know, revoke his PhD, cancel his article.

198
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,700
If he shows up at any conferences,

199
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,060
this was Hamad Dabishi at Columbia University,

200
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,100
we should attack him.

201
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,220
We should mob him.

202
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,300
We should silence him.

203
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,820
We should snub him.

204
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,660
Because that's all they have.

205
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,100
Then we get my faculty union at Portland State saying,

206
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,820
I should be stripped of academic freedom

207
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
and stripped of my faculty position

208
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,700
because my research is outside

209
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,100
of the totalitarian ideology of anti-colonialism, right?

210
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,320
So yeah, I mean, part of me is like, what do you expect, right?

211
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,260
And people like you have been studying

212
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,040
the totalitarian mindset of DEI and Wokeness for so long.

213
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,400
We shouldn't be surprised when its response

214
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,680
to a liberal critique is racists, reactionaries.

215
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,640
No, that's not what surprises me.

216
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,840
But what surprises me is that,

217
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,600
isn't there a universal rule set?

218
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,960
I mean, there was up until very, very recently,

219
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,920
maybe, I can't give you an exact date,

220
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,080
but maybe 2010, I'm guessing,

221
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,040
that if somebody plagiarized a dissertation,

222
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,640
and I think it would probably suit me well

223
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,360
to have names of people who they've caught in the past

224
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,920
who have plagiarized and then they lost their PhDs,

225
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,200
is it that if you adhere to one particular orthodoxy,

226
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,840
I mean, okay, so, Braggman,

227
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,560
isn't there just some kind of a rule

228
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,080
that if you plagiarize, there's no rule to that?

229
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,000
I mean, come on, look at how many,

230
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,920
what we thought were foundations of higher education

231
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,760
collapsed in the last five years.

232
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,800
You know, the idea of a student code of conduct

233
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,400
at Princeton, which included don't plagiarize,

234
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,560
was attacked and taken down by the Black Student Union

235
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
because they said plagiarism's okay.

236
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
This was long before Claudine Gay.

237
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,880
The leading lights of African-American society

238
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,240
who have been carefully selected and curated

239
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,480
to go to Princeton were rallying on campus

240
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,320
to say, cheating, plagiarizing, faking your grades,

241
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,080
stealing papers, buying papers is okay,

242
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
because otherwise we're just replicating

243
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,320
the prison to pipeline, you know,

244
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,280
the campus school to prison pipeline.

245
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,440
So we knew those foundations were crumbling.

246
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,360
Mandatory SAT scores to enter, gone.

247
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,400
Mandatory requirements to pass or reach a certain standard

248
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,720
to get a high school degree, gone, right?

249
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,800
So plagiarism, not okay, gone, right?

250
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,600
So by the time Claudine Gay gets into this controversy,

251
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,520
we have these two worlds, right?

252
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,860
We have the old liberal world of academic standards

253
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,280
that you and I live in, but we don't realize

254
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,160
how far the other side has drifted away from this.

255
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,240
And it's not that we didn't plagiarize,

256
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,720
it's of course we plagiarized and you pointing it out

257
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,280
and saying there's something wrong with it is racist.

258
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,360
That's exactly what the critique is,

259
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,200
that there's something wrong with us for,

260
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,880
so I think that that will go down

261
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,360
among a certain group of people,

262
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,760
like Mark Lamont Hill and his supporters and-

263
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,600
Kendi.

264
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,880
And Kendi.

265
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,360
So just to be crystal clear about something

266
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
that this is not about race,

267
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,240
I'm telling you right with total sincerity,

268
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,920
I'm running your dissertation through a plagiarism checker,

269
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,080
and if you're found guilty of plagiarism,

270
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,760
I'm gonna suggest that you lose your PhD revoked.

271
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,100
Please do.

272
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,140
And I would demand on our friendship

273
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,380
that you would do the same to me.

274
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,860
Absolutely.

275
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,420
If my PhD dissertation, I can't remember what the name is,

276
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,420
it's a critical-

277
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,460
I can't remember the name of it.

278
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,580
I can't remember what the name is,

279
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,460
it's something like, it's been so long ago.

280
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,260
But if that were found to have plagiarism,

281
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,420
I would expect on the basis of our friendship

282
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,180
that you would call for the revoking of my PhD.

283
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,020
Absolutely.

284
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,700
So that is a kind of integrity that is-

285
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,780
Or anything you've published academically for that matter.

286
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,540
Right, right.

287
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,060
Us for me.

288
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,060
No, no, for sure, for sure.

289
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,140
Yeah, okay, so I'll broaden, yeah.

290
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,980
So, that goes beyond the range of...

291
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,140
That's just an integrity issue, right?

292
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,140
So it doesn't have to do with our friendship.

293
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,980
The fact that I'm your friend, that we're friends,

294
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,780
should have absolutely nothing to do

295
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,220
with the fact that you would be...

296
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,820
That makes the plagiarism okay with you.

297
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,220
The fact that we're white or male or sister,

298
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,980
whatever we want to say, whatever phrase we want,

299
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,020
it's totally independent from the fact that we violated

300
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,260
the closest thing that there is to a sin in academia

301
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,100
is plagiarism.

302
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,780
Like that's the gold standard for bad.

303
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,420
So it's independent of any attribute that we possess

304
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,500
or of any relationship.

305
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,020
Like this is deeper than that.

306
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,420
Well, yes and no.

307
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,500
I mean, of course, that's the way we would like

308
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,940
American society to operate on the basis of equality

309
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,100
and colorblind race neutrality and merit,

310
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,540
but it doesn't, right?

311
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,500
And the reason Claudine Gaye was hired

312
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,060
was because she's a black woman.

313
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,180
That's the only reason.

314
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,860
I mean, not even close, right?

315
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,300
It wasn't even like a tiebreaker consideration.

316
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,860
With someone I say, okay, we have two excellent candidates.

317
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,060
They both have amazing administrative,

318
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,500
fundraising experience.

319
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,980
They're incredibly well-renowned scholars,

320
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,940
10 university-pressed books each.

321
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,100
How are you gonna say that?

322
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,180
Okay, and we haven't had a black woman

323
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,420
and there's some discussion, it might be useful.

324
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,260
Let's do it.

325
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,580
Okay, a lot of us, even liberals would say,

326
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,780
okay, in that situation where the candidates are close

327
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,500
and it's just a tiebreaker.

328
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,700
Yeah, fine.

329
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,260
Not even close, right?

330
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,540
She was hired only because she is a black woman, right?

331
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,260
Her scholarship was so tawdry.

332
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,100
I know, I read it.

333
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,340
She wouldn't even get hired at Portland State.

334
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,180
No, she wouldn't.

335
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,020
Oh, that's a con.

336
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,140
Oh, that's a low bloke.

337
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,460
That's a low bloke.

338
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,140
No, but I mean, no, no, because actually

339
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,420
to get a 10-year job in a state university

340
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,780
takes actually a decent amount of good scholarship these days,

341
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,700
given the mismatch.

342
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,100
She had 11 publications.

343
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,140
I've read as many of those as I can access.

344
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,860
I've read them in their entirety.

345
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,940
I just read someone who analyzed her dissertation

346
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,540
and it's exactly as one would expect,

347
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,300
barring the plagiarism, sloppy invalid inferences,

348
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,540
fallacious reasoning throughout.

349
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,100
Word salad everywhere.

350
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,180
Just nothing but word salad.

351
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,340
Yeah, and she was lauded.

352
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,140
She won all these prizes.

353
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,580
The society has drifted so, we've lost our minds.

354
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,060
We've drifted so far from merit.

355
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,700
Now the institutions, the engines of knowledge

356
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,820
production of the society are fundamentally compromised.

357
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,500
Well, you could be pessimistic and say

358
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,380
that the Harvard case or any of these cases

359
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,460
shows that the academy is beyond saving.

360
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,420
And that may be true.

361
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,420
But don't forget, the great thing about free society

362
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,980
or the saving grace of a free society

363
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,300
is it can always reorganize elsewhere, right?

364
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,340
It can always escape a toxic situation or organization

365
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,020
and regroup in other ways.

366
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,740
It's what happens to cities when they get bombed out

367
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,380
like Portland did during the George Floyd summer of love.

368
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,940
And suddenly all the growth and all the wealth

369
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,620
and all the dynamism is now living outside of Portland, right?

370
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,820
Maybe in the periphery, but outside of Portland.

371
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,780
So that's OK.

372
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,180
We've seen a little bit of that in the university space,

373
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,100
not just with the new universities, which I don't think

374
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,460
really have it, but universities that are maybe second tier

375
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,460
that are attracting a lot better students,

376
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,980
getting away from the woke universities.

377
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,820
We see this also in research, right?

378
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,700
Because, yeah, academic research in many fields

379
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,860
like public policy may be a complete joke at this point

380
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,900
from within the university.

381
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,980
But that's why we have think tanks, right?

382
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,660
We have think tanks who are now basically picking up

383
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,380
the slack saying the things that need to be said.

384
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,140
So I mean, and mainstream media, another example, right?

385
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,460
Basically being hollowed out and now massive amounts

386
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,340
of media reformulating, reorganizing itself

387
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,500
on the outside of the mainstream

388
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,340
since the mainstream has gone through a process of involution.

389
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,580
OK, so let's just accept by fiat the argument

390
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,980
that I'm going to give you is correct.

391
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,660
And here's the argument.

392
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,980
And I've actually made this prediction

393
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,180
for the first 30 days, what we're going to see in.

394
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,860
And I made this a travest.

395
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,020
I think that this ideology, critical social justice,

396
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,780
will be pushed into ill repute probably in five months.

397
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,260
We already see it an expedited version.

398
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,860
We see this happening now.

399
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,420
But just accept that this is all going to happen.

400
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,020
We are going to find that the rot, the plagiarism,

401
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,900
is rampant among not only DEI bureaucrats.

402
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,020
I think that there's a hierarchy of where you'll find it.

403
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,740
But in the hard sciences, the STEM sciences,

404
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,540
there'll be less so.

405
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,140
Maybe there'll be methodological problems.

406
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,540
But that's so labor intensive to find.

407
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,140
We're not even going to talk about that.

408
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,780
But in DEI and soft fields, you're

409
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,180
going to find rampant plagiarism.

410
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,420
OK, the universities are going to be pushed into ill repute.

411
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,300
Or not ill repute.

412
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,500
The ideology will be pushed into ill repute.

413
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,420
The universities will further lose their legitimacy.

414
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,060
And hopefully, the numbers of enrollment will plummet.

415
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:44,660
So my question to you is, accepting that that's the case,

416
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,460
what do you see as the outcome of that?

417
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,060
Are there like University of Austin?

418
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,460
Are there these new universities coming up?

419
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,060
Or do the people just, you think there's

420
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,900
going to be another sea shift, where you say, well,

421
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,460
don't hire people from universities

422
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,940
or go to Khan Academy and get a certificate?

423
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,220
What do you see is going to happen?

424
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,060
Remember, there's always a demand side for skills

425
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,860
in the economy.

426
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,940
And first of all, as you said, in sciences, those fields,

427
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,060
despite the attempts of DEI and Wokeness,

428
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,460
but they can't afford that.

429
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,460
Because science and technology fields

430
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,180
are changing so rapidly with computing

431
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,220
and computer-assisted biology, physics, chemistry,

432
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,420
engineering.

433
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,820
These fields, they don't have time for this BS,

434
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,780
even though we see it in medical schools a little bit.

435
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,020
But not really, because even the medical field

436
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,260
doesn't have time for this.

437
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,940
Professional schools, engineering, dentistry,

438
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,100
architecture, I mean, they planning.

439
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,540
They need to get stuff taught.

440
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,620
But we see it now, too.

441
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,820
We see it in medicine.

442
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,980
We do, but it's not at the core.

443
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,300
It's not at the same degree as in the humanities.

444
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,140
That's for sure.

445
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,980
Right, right.

446
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,500
And my guess is it will remain outside of the core

447
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,300
of these fields because there's a simple supply

448
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,500
and demand equation, which is employers

449
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,620
who are expected to carry out highly risky

450
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,060
and technically demanding skills

451
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,580
require employees who can show they've graduated

452
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,700
from programs and they will simply not hire you

453
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,380
if you're not graduating from a program

454
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,220
that's delivering the skills.

455
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,580
And they'll know within days whether you were taught or not.

456
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,300
So I think those areas are pretty safe.

457
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,380
Humanities and social sciences is a total different area

458
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,500
because ultimately the reason those degrees used

459
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,220
to generate value added for the graduates

460
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,540
was you could think.

461
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,260
Yeah, well, you could think you were articulate

462
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,380
in dealing with others.

463
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,940
You could work in groups.

464
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,300
You could think about social situations.

465
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,620
You could execute projects.

466
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,620
You had some degree of ability to communicate effectively.

467
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,060
And you were able to shift.

468
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,700
You were able to change roles

469
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,300
because you weren't so specialized.

470
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,980
You were a generalist by training.

471
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,420
That's what they taught you is to be a generalist by training

472
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,940
and that's often very useful in an organization.

473
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,340
But what happens when those students are found

474
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,340
to be less good in those generalist roles

475
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,180
than students who went to community college

476
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,300
or technical college?

477
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,140
Well, then you see the decline in the enrollment

478
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,820
because the decline in the job offers.

479
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,700
So then you get a migration into fields

480
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,140
that seem to be still rigorous, right?

481
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,860
I mean, one of the reasons why we see people migrating

482
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,860
into colleges like Catholic colleges

483
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,100
or liberal arts colleges that are more conservative

484
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,500
is because people are looking for where is that

485
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,860
still rigorous liberal arts education.

486
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,540
But I think the bigger picture is, yeah,

487
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,500
that social science humanities space

488
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,540
that used to generate a lot of value added

489
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,420
is just not gonna generate the value added

490
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,460
and employers are gonna know it, so it's gonna shrink.

491
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,460
So if everything I've said is correct,

492
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,140
you predict enrollments will further plummet.

493
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,740
I wanna add on one thing that you said,

494
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,900
maybe it's a pushback, maybe it's an add.

495
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,140
It's not just that people aren't qualified.

496
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,300
It's almost as if they're anti-qualified

497
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,900
when they get degrees because they're coming in

498
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,220
with the wrong skill sets.

499
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,740
They're coming in not with thinking about things

500
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,660
in terms of merit or efficiency or what have you,

501
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,420
but in terms of developing a lens,

502
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,300
a critical consciousness, a lens to identify racism.

503
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,380
They're not thinking about it

504
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,220
in terms of maximizing shareholder wealth.

505
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,180
Like they have a different set of organizing principles

506
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,260
that they come into the, so it could actually be

507
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,580
an even worse thing that you hire them

508
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,020
or as if you just hired a kind of random person

509
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,140
who wasn't a doctorate.

510
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,300
Like, because it's always worse to do a worse thing

511
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,460
by definition that is to do something neutral.

512
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,420
Yeah, but keep in mind the totality

513
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,540
of the intellectual and social maturation

514
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:51,540
that happens for a 18 year old in the four years

515
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,420
between leaving high school and four years in college

516
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,420
and getting out.

517
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,620
Now, yes, what their woke professor forces them to read

518
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,100
and write in the classroom is part of that.

519
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,820
But if I was to put a percentage wise

520
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,740
on that kind of inculcation of wokeness into the student

521
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,180
as the totality in terms of the contribution

522
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,140
to the intellectual social development,

523
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,180
I'd say 20%.

524
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,380
Really? Yeah.

525
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,620
You don't think someone caught in the orbit of that idea?

526
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,820
No, because I think 80% of what happens,

527
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,940
80% of what actually generates value for college

528
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,620
is simply being surrounded by smart, interesting,

529
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,620
curious young people like yourself for four years

530
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,100
with a certain subject as the kind of excuse to be there.

531
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,100
But much of what happens in college,

532
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,380
as we all know who've been there,

533
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,820
is the conversations, the friendships,

534
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,980
the extracurriculars, even the decoding

535
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,740
of your stupid professor, right?

536
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,420
I.e. the kind of mimicking what the professor wants,

537
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,740
but knowing all along that this is nonsense

538
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,180
or there's something wrong with that.

539
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,380
That's actually also part

540
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,100
of the intellectual maturation process.

541
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,580
So, professors, and I sometimes think critics

542
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,980
of higher education over exaggerate

543
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,020
the role of the curriculum

544
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,660
and the courses in what the students are doing on campus

545
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,060
and what exactly is contributing

546
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,260
to their intellectual and social maturation.

547
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,220
So, students go through these programs

548
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,180
and they come out actually amazingly normal.

549
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,380
You know, if they studied women and black studies

550
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,540
or something, right?

551
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,620
But they still need to organize the bake sale.

552
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,460
They still need to figure

553
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,940
out their dorm room roommates for the next year.

554
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,680
They still needed to get their flights back and forth.

555
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,020
They still needed to get the debate team

556
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,180
to the debate competition.

557
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,660
They still needed to get their gym pass

558
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,300
and go to the pool three times a week.

559
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,580
I mean, all this stuff that's taking place on the periphery

560
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,380
is actually part of the maturation process.

561
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,220
I see that.

562
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,060
I guess I don't agree.

563
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,140
I mean, I don't agree because what you said

564
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,940
would only be true if there were intellectual diversity

565
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,920
among the peer group.

566
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,060
But if there's a culture, if there's a cultural soup

567
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,980
in which certain conclusions are forwarded

568
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,500
and certain people aren't allowed to challenge that,

569
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,300
it seems like being in that environment

570
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,420
would not only be epistemologically

571
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,940
and cognitively damaging to one's social

572
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,820
and even emotional development,

573
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,640
but over time it would be sclerotic

574
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,140
in terms of muscles would atrophy

575
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,020
that need to work through these problems.

576
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,380
Now, yeah, you do have logistics.

577
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,940
You'd have to like figure out how to get to the pool

578
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,900
or you know, how to get a gym pass.

579
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,260
But you would need to do that if you weren't in college.

580
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,500
Yeah, but remember what's important about college

581
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,700
is it's the peer group, right?

582
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,500
Is that it's like a bunch of kids

583
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,660
who wanna get further education.

584
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,660
So the inclination or the orientation of these kids

585
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,660
is academically, to some extent.

586
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,260
I mean, less than the lower school.

587
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,140
Once you're in a good state school,

588
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,660
everyone's there to learn and to be something and to plan.

589
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,500
That's one thing.

590
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,220
The second thing is there's a huge difference.

591
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,060
And I would agree with you

592
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,860
that when we talk about small liberal arts

593
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,860
colleges, what you say that's sclerosis

594
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,460
and the inbreeding, absolutely.

595
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,680
So that's why Reed College,

596
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,580
which is close to where I live in Portland, Oregon,

597
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,540
is the second highest ranked liberal arts college

598
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,460
in the country.

599
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,300
It is also the worst ranked college in the state of Oregon.

600
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,220
One of the worst, bottom 10 worst in the entire country

601
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,740
for taking value away from students

602
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,420
based on what we would expect their income to be

603
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,340
based on their incoming SAT scores.

604
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,940
So that's how we basically add,

605
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,380
like calculate what a college does to a person

606
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,540
is look at their incoming SAT scores and class ranking

607
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,740
and then say, okay, that person like that

608
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,260
typically would end up earning this.

609
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,060
People who go to Reed or any of these

610
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,060
really woke liberal arts colleges way underperform.

611
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,300
Now that's exactly evidence of what you're talking about,

612
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,460
that that is so inbred and sclerotic

613
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,260
and there's no diversity of thinking.

614
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,820
But if you're at a big research university, right,

615
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,980
don't forget that that faculty of arts and science, right,

616
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,840
might be a very small part of the entire university.

617
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,680
In fact, I did an article a couple of months ago

618
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,400
on looking at all degrees awarded in the United States.

619
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,160
And I found that only about 30% were in fields

620
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,320
that could remotely be considered woke.

621
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,760
So consider a university that's basically a 70-30 split,

622
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,600
right?

623
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,920
Now, yes, if you really don't ever leave

624
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,120
your little college classroom

625
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,080
and just hang out with those 30%,

626
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,920
yeah, there'll be some sclerosis there.

627
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,640
But you're in a sea of engineers,

628
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,520
commerce students, dentists students, biology majors,

629
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,760
biomedical engineering, AI, computer science,

630
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,680
parks and recreation, right?

631
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,240
I mean, and these are actually the fields

632
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,160
that you're making friendships with.

633
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,560
And so there's just such a dilution

634
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,920
of that woke curriculum in a major research university.

635
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,520
So I think the harm is much reduced

636
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,840
compared to in a liberal arts college.

637
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Yeah, that's interesting and somewhat hopeful.

638
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,200
I want to do one more thing before I talk about the case

639
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,840
for colonialism.

640
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,280
Do you have any predictions about specifically

641
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,960
the academic landscape, about what

642
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,840
we're going to see in six months or a year?

643
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,040
So one thing that typically happens in a case like this,

644
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,160
the cycle is we're going to see this focus on competency

645
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,520
for university presidents.

646
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,040
It's going to be all about competency.

647
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,200
The diversity hires are going to be out the window.

648
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,160
We're going to see a move to competency.

649
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,560
We're going to see a move to the managers.

650
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,200
I mean, it's almost like the revolutionary cycle.

651
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,320
It's like the worst period of the revolution

652
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,000
is now coming to an end, the sort of bloodletting

653
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,280
and the crazy extremists who got in positions of power

654
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,240
have finally proven to be unable to manage the organization.

655
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,800
You get this is called Thermador.

656
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,680
In the revolutionary calendar in France,

657
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,640
this was called Thermador.

658
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,760
This is when the managers came into power,

659
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,200
settled things down, de-democratized a little bit.

660
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,720
So the DEI and the Black Studies Association

661
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,040
doesn't get a veto on the university president choice.

662
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,400
Competency, proven track record,

663
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,120
become the currency of the realm.

664
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,640
I think that's pretty clear.

665
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,320
That's pretty easy prediction.

666
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,280
The more difficult prediction is.

667
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,520
And therefore, do we see some serious efforts

668
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,200
at re-establishing the integrity of the university?

669
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,600
I mean, you had seen some of that coming in,

670
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,120
in terms of faculty-led freedom of thought

671
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,240
and academic freedom groups springing up

672
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,680
on the margins, but if the group at Harvard is an example,

673
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,600
that's a very weak straw to expect reform from.

674
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,280
Steven Pinker's group, which was set up

675
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,480
with some foundation funding to promote academic freedom

676
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,760
at Harvard, and they said, well, we're

677
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,240
going to have some seminars and have some teachings

678
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,280
and talk about higher education reform and stuff.

679
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,840
Well, it was nowhere to be seen during this entire debacle,

680
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,240
nowhere to be seen.

681
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,120
I predict within the next few months,

682
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,880
we're going to see massive incidents of plagiarism.

683
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,200
And there's a hierarchy, as I said, with DEI,

684
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,400
the squishy stuff.

685
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,040
I think you're going to see it in psychology.

686
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,080
I think you're going to see it across the board.

687
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,920
Here's my fear, and for anybody listening,

688
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:30,640
I really hope that this is the case.

689
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,520
Don't just go, I want people to research,

690
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,400
do their own research.

691
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,560
I want people to dig in.

692
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,800
I want people to be sleuths.

693
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,200
I want people to find things.

694
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,280
But you can't just put it out there

695
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,640
unless you are absolutely positive.

696
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,600
Because every instance of something

697
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,760
that you put out that you're not positive of,

698
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,360
it's going to come back to bite you,

699
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,600
and then people are going to say, this is all right.

700
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,960
It's going to cloud the issue, yeah.

701
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,960
And then you're going to have other people who

702
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,000
want the DEI bureaucrats in place, who

703
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,920
are going to pretend they found plagiarism, who

704
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,320
haven't found plagiarism.

705
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,160
I'm sure someone's already thought of that.

706
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,960
So I am both optimistic, and I'm not optimistic.

707
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
But I think we're seeing the tip of the iceberg.

708
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,800
And again, what's to be super interesting to me

709
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,480
is to figure out what percentage of my former colleagues

710
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,840
or percentage of people across various disciplines

711
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,520
have plagiarized.

712
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,240
Because it's only a matter of time.

713
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,520
And again, I'm not talking sloppy methodologies

714
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,160
or what have you, which Gay also had.

715
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,480
I'm talking actual textbook plagiarism.

716
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,680
I don't know the answer to that, but within the next few months,

717
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,720
we are going to find out.

718
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,680
Certainly within six months, we're going to find out.

719
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,120
Keep in mind, we're operating in a world

720
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,160
where plagiarism is a rather old-fashioned concept anyways.

721
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,840
Most young people grew up in a cut-and-paste world.

722
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,240
That's how they did their research.

723
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,720
So you know what I'm going to do?

724
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,240
I'm going to take this book, The Case for Colonialism.

725
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,720
I'm going to do exactly the same thing,

726
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,880
but I'm going to put Peter Bogosian right there.

727
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,960
I'm going to do the same thing.

728
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,800
I'm going to write that it's going to be the same book.

729
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,120
It's going to be the same title.

730
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,400
How do you feel about that?

731
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,880
It wouldn't surprise me in the least.

732
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,280
No, but I mean, I'm serious.

733
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,480
We know from our own students that they don't recognize

734
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,200
they're doing something wrong when they cut-and-paste

735
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,080
a Wikipedia article and lightly edit it to say what they

736
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,880
wanted to say.

737
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,080
And now we have chat GBT going on as well.

738
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,240
So this is not an issue that is as cut-and-dried.

739
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,800
It may be cut-and-dried to us from a standards perspective,

740
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,480
but in the culture, this is not a cut-and-dried issue.

741
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,200
Now, how easy is it for the DEI types

742
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,680
to then segue or more likely to slipstream

743
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,280
off that cultural assumption that we're all

744
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,800
in this kind of mixtape kind of culture

745
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,320
and say, well, you're just calling out this mixtaper

746
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,760
because they're black, right?

747
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,800
And suddenly the issue is clouded over.

748
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,800
It's partisan.

749
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,400
The president of Stanford was white,

750
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,720
and he just resigned for falsification of data.

751
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,760
Yeah, well, but that's the thing.

752
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,440
When you come in with an idea, when you're a hammer,

753
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,800
everything looks like a nail.

754
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,440
So they just write those things off as anomalous.

755
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,320
Yeah, I just don't think it's as straight a pathway

756
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,480
as you think to say you have this long paragraph, which

757
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,080
is verbatim from this book.

758
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,140
There's no footnote.

759
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,920
There's no mention of a citation.

760
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,000
This is wrong.

761
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,680
And you think this is a cut-and-dried case, right?

762
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,320
Well, it's true.

763
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,040
She should have been more careful.

764
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Duplicit of language.

765
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:36,200
Yeah, or she was learning and using and was sloppy, right?

766
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,920
But this idea that this is simply a slam-dunk case

767
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,080
for the person to be whatever is, I think,

768
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,000
a treasure chestnut of you and me.

769
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,960
But I don't think that that's going to play out,

770
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,440
especially when all you need to do

771
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,640
is throw out some cloudy issues like race.

772
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,000
Or, well, all these people said this was plagiarism,

773
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,800
and it was sloppy.

774
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,640
It turned out not to be.

775
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,800
So we need to find an instance of somebody

776
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,960
who is not black who lost their PhD.

777
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,200
There must be somebody who lost their PhD for plagiarism.

778
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,320
I'm sure there's lots, lots, lots.

779
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,760
And so we need to.

780
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,120
So the next thing in this is everybody.

781
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,280
Well, I would just look up retraction watch, right?

782
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,200
Which is retraction.

783
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,560
Retraction watch has always done this.

784
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,600
Oh, yeah, they retracted the hoax articles.

785
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,240
Yeah, and anything retracted for any reason.

786
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,000
And a lot of those are plagiarism cases.

787
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,680
And maybe you can sort and you can see all the retractions

788
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,240
for plagiarism.

789
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,840
So we need to figure out an institutional way

790
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,720
to have these people's PhDs broke.

791
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,360
And I don't care if you're in any field, philosophy,

792
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,640
political science.

793
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,840
I don't care if you're a midget.

794
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,440
I don't care what your weight is.

795
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,840
Your height.

796
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,040
I need to totally irrelevant.

797
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,840
Your race.

798
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,800
Absolutely irrelevant.

799
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,720
If you plagiarized, you should lose your decision,

800
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,040
including me and including you.

801
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,920
Of course.

802
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,680
Of course.

803
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,960
But let's watch that play out.

804
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,480
And ultimately, it'll always surprise us how it does.

805
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,360
It's funny, though, also because I

806
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,520
advocate these positions.

807
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,920
I'm suddenly a conservative.

808
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,160
That's what fascinates me.

809
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,800
Yeah, although remember, you know, sometimes it's the room

810
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,680
outside the room.

811
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,320
And I think if you spend a lot of time inside the room,

812
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,400
you're not aware that actually outside of the room,

813
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,840
the dynamics are very different.

814
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,080
So, you know, of course, you're a conservative within the

815
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,760
higher academic or cultural wars perspective,

816
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,120
because all the people you're arguing against

817
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,560
are far left lunatics, right?

818
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,440
But in normal society, people would probably see you as too

819
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,440
much of a kind of waffly liberal.

820
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,280
Yeah, liberal liberal.

821
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,720
Yeah, and in American political discourse,

822
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,040
you'd be kind of like suspicious center or center leftist.

823
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,320
So actually, you know, it's like where you

824
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,360
calibrating yourself, you know?

825
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,800
And if you're in the lunatic asylum,

826
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,160
you're going to be the sanest person there.

827
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Doesn't mean you don't have some mental issues in society.

828
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,920
Right, right.

829
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,720
So, OK, so let's go back.

830
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,600
So I required the case for colonialism for all my students.

831
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,560
Talk a little bit, if you don't mind, about that.

832
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,560
That was a crazy controversy.

833
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,920
So people lost their minds at you.

834
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,480
Tell us about it.

835
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,560
I know you've talked about it before, but just tell us about it.

836
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,080
So as 2017, this article came out, so it's six years now.

837
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,720
The article was basically a backgrounder for myself,

838
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,720
because I was about to write the biography of a British colonial

839
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,560
official, and he had written and said a lot about the case

840
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,880
for colonialism, but he wasn't a scholar.

841
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,560
He was an official.

842
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,120
He was giving speeches, and it was kind of all over the place.

843
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,400
I was like, let's bring some order to this argument.

844
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,000
Like, what exactly is the argument?

845
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,200
How does it run logically?

846
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,320
And so I essentially put this argument together

847
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,080
to be useful for myself before I wrote the book.

848
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,000
So when I came to kind of some ways repeating

849
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,760
and making sense of what he had said,

850
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,920
I could organize a little better.

851
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
So who's the reason?

852
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,000
Sir Allen Burns was a British colonial official.

853
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,120
The book was called The Last Imperialist.

854
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,440
Ended up coming out in 2019.

855
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,880
And it was very successful.

856
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,840
But this was a backgrounder to that, essentially, for myself.

857
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,280
But I thought, hey, this is useful,

858
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,760
because there's not this article out there.

859
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,240
We always have the case for this, the case for that,

860
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,760
in defense of this, or against this, whatever.

861
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,760
That's part of the academic discourse.

862
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,800
And I had published an article two years earlier

863
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,040
on Chinua Kebe, the African novelist,

864
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,240
saying that this guy who is supposedly

865
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,760
this pantheonic figure in anti-colonialism

866
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,520
actually wasn't anti-colonial at all.

867
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,040
Or at least he had mixed views,

868
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,600
would be a charitable reading.

869
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,640
Okay, let me pause you.

870
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,400
Explain colonialism.

871
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,240
What is that in two sentences?

872
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,960
Colonialism, in one sentence,

873
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,360
is when country A extends its governance system

874
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,080
over territory B,

875
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,440
which does not have a sovereign governing system at the time.

876
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,400
Okay, all right, so that situates it.

877
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,400
So you wrote The Case for Colonialism in 2017,

878
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,200
and you published it in Third World Quarterly,

879
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,040
which, high impact factor journal, correct me if I'm wrong.

880
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,880
Yeah.

881
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,840
Right, so it's very reputable.

882
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,880
It wasn't, you know, back of a magazine,

883
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,720
it was a very highly reputable academic journal.

884
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,040
And what happened?

885
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,880
Well, it got two reviews.

886
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,720
One was positive, one was negative.

887
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,320
So typically in a case like that,

888
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,080
it goes to the editor,

889
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,400
and the editor can make a decision,

890
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,640
accept or reject.

891
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,720
And funnily enough,

892
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,920
I had the same experience

893
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,440
with the first journal I submitted it to,

894
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,800
the Journal of Intervention and State Building.

895
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,140
Got one except one reject.

896
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,200
And the managing editor,

897
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,840
rather than making his call based on academic criteria

898
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,880
or his judgment,

899
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,520
went to the board and said,

900
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,880
I'd really like to publish this,

901
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,800
but I'm kind of afraid of the backlash.

902
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,840
And the board said, you're right,

903
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,660
too politically risky,

904
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,920
give it a reject because of the political backlash.

905
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,080
Right, so not that it was false,

906
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,280
sort of a sloppy, sloppy organization.

907
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,680
Afraid to publish it, afraid to publish it.

908
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,480
And I've named him in the book, you know, it's all public.

909
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,200
So Third World Quarterly was the same except reject,

910
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,440
but this time the editor did what an editor

911
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,280
is supposed to do,

912
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,880
just exercise his or her judgment

913
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,000
in terms of the academic merit.

914
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,840
Merit, merit.

915
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,840
Merit, whether the article would contribute

916
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,800
to the journal, spark a debate.

917
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,360
And he said, yes, this is great.

918
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,640
Let's run it.

919
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,520
He said, let's run it as a commentary article

920
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,920
rather than as original research article.

921
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,920
So it's a peer-reviewed commentary article

922
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,920
rather than a peer-reviewed research article.

923
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,800
But, you know, like most journals,

924
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,400
they have a variety of types of peer-reviewed articles

925
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,720
that they accept, you know,

926
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,920
short research contributions, research articles,

927
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,820
commentaries, whatever I said, fine.

928
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,620
Publish it as a commentary article.

929
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,340
Within minutes of its appearance online

930
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,560
before its formal publication in the journal,

931
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,740
there was an outrage storm on Facebook,

932
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,420
started on Facebook, right?

933
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,900
Because a friend of mine in Australia said,

934
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,900
oh, you're like not my Facebook page, mate.

935
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,580
Well done, you know, in email to me.

936
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,420
That's good, dude.

937
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,260
Yeah, and I said, what's going on?

938
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,900
I saw a colleague of mine on the street.

939
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,060
She said, do you know what's happening out there?

940
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,020
I was like, no, you mean the article?

941
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,620
Yeah, oh, she said it's much bigger than you think.

942
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,420
By the time I got back to my desk,

943
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,700
I mean, thousands of hate mails filling up my email box,

944
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,660
such that my email at Portland State

945
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,940
stopped accepting new emails.

946
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,580
It crashed my email box, basically.

947
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,940
And then two petitions started up, right?

948
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,220
One petitioned by a woman who was a graduate

949
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,460
of interpretive dance in the UK.

950
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,980
You just can't make it up, OK?

951
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:53,860
Saying stop reading the Third World Quarterly,

952
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,700
punish the Third World Quarterly.

953
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,700
The other started by a tenured academic at Syracuse University

954
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,980
called Farhana Sultana from Bangladesh,

955
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,740
who obviously didn't get the message when she migrated

956
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,700
to the United States that this is a free country

957
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,100
and we're supposed to uphold academic freedom.

958
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,460
A Princeton graduate, by the way.

959
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,580
My alma mater.

960
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,900
Farhana Sultana said that we demand

961
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,460
the article be retracted.

962
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,820
We demand that both Gilly and the editor of the Third World

963
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,380
Quarterly apologize.

964
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,620
And then, separately, on her Facebook page,

965
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:35,980
she started a petition to have my PhD from Princeton to vote.

966
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,220
And so by the time it was all said and done,

967
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:44,100
more than 40,000 people had signed these two petitions.

968
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,180
And ultimately, the way it was resolved

969
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,100
was the editorial staff of the Third World

970
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,540
Quarterly in London were getting death threats.

971
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,060
Right.

972
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,020
Credible death threats.

973
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,220
Yes, credible death threats.

974
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,140
And the Metropolitan Police said to them,

975
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,820
we can't promise you safety.

976
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,540
We don't assign bodyguard units to everybody.

977
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,580
So the editor called me.

978
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,740
The editor called me.

979
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,580
And I said, of course, retract it.

980
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,140
Withdrawed is the correct term.

981
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,620
Withdrawed.

982
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,460
Was not retracted.

983
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:16,420
It was withdrawn by me for the physical safety of the staff

984
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,260
there, reprinted in academic questions, separate journal,

985
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,620
and then eventually formed the core of the book that's

986
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,620
the case for colonialism.

987
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,820
OK, so this is so fascinating to me

988
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,820
and so many others, because I had people coming up to me

989
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,420
when I defended you for that.

990
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:38,380
And I actually sent out some emails to people saying,

991
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,260
because there was something at PSU, right,

992
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,340
where they wanted you sanctioned.

993
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:46,300
They wanted you to tell us about that.

994
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,940
Right, so I got a lot of hate mail from PSU as well.

995
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,180
Eventually, the provost at the time issued a statement.

996
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,020
This was like within a week of the outburst.

997
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,580
And I mean, this is like a provost statement on the issue

998
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:04,100
saying, Dr. Gilley published this article.

999
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:10,380
It doesn't represent the views of the faculty at Portland State.

1000
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,580
Some people say he should be fired,

1001
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,980
but we have this thing called academic freedom.

1002
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,300
So we encourage people to debate and discuss and rebut his

1003
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,140
arguments.

1004
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,340
I suppose people said that was a good response,

1005
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:29,100
because she was saying we can't act.

1006
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,620
To me, it was a lame-ass response,

1007
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,020
because she said we can't act.

1008
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,380
In other words, if I could fire this guy, I would.

1009
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,940
Unfortunately, we have this problem

1010
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,300
called academic freedom, which protects right-wing fascists

1011
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,380
like Gilley.

1012
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:48,140
And if we fired him, we'd be violating our state

1013
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,060
constitution, which we would be in addition

1014
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,900
to his academic freedom.

1015
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,460
It was hardly we are dismayed that our faculty members have

1016
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,780
participated in the mob to silence Dr. Gilley,

1017
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,380
because so many PSU faculty members signed those petitions,

1018
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,380
including one who's now my departmental colleague,

1019
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,700
because her department failed, and we acquired it.

1020
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,140
See, that's fascinating to me, because I don't know if I've

1021
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,460
told you this, but I caught massive shit for defending you

1022
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,140
and saying, and I sent out emails,

1023
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,940
and I said, if you have a problem with this,

1024
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,100
because there was a vote.

1025
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,620
I can't remember what was something like someone voted.

1026
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,900
And I said, I'd like to find all those people who voted,

1027
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,700
and I'd like to moderate a debate on stage between you

1028
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,180
and Dr. Gilley.

1029
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,820
And guess how many people took that up?

1030
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,380
Right.

1031
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:33,900
Zero.

1032
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,660
So yeah, there was an attempt at a faculty resolution

1033
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,820
condemning me that failed.

1034
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,020
So it was those people, I think.

1035
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,540
I said, everybody who I said, I'd like to have you on stage.

1036
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,620
So if you have a problem with this, that's great,

1037
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,460
that you're totally entitled to do that.

1038
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,300
Let's go on stage, and we'll have that public conversation.

1039
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:54,980
We'll be free.

1040
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,660
We'll throw through through some student unit,

1041
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,060
and we'll have that conversation.

1042
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,220
Nobody took me up on it.

1043
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,020
Zero.

1044
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,380
So they were against something, but they don't feel,

1045
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,460
they don't know enough about what they're against to feel

1046
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,900
that they can defend it.

1047
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,140
Well, what they told themselves is,

1048
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,620
this is like agreeing to a debate on the Holocaust.

1049
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,620
And I won't participate in this because it would just

1050
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,700
normalize this as a debate.

1051
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,140
This is not debatable.

1052
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,060
Colonialism was evil, lock stock and barrel.

1053
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,380
And even having the temerity to ask me to debate it

1054
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,820
shows how unreformed you are.

1055
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,660
And we really need to shut this down.

1056
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,100
So OK, whatever.

1057
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,180
That's just the totalitarian mindset.

1058
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,940
But having failed at the faculty senate level,

1059
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:43,020
the faculty union really just Jennifer Ruth, a film studies

1060
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,100
professor who was the academic freedom

1061
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,220
director at the faculty union, who later wrote a book,

1062
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,180
Attacking Me and Other Faculty Members.

1063
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:53,300
Got how well is that academic freedom?

1064
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,180
Academic freedom director.

1065
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,700
So the faculty union passed a resolution

1066
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,060
condemning my research.

1067
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,940
I call it a fatwa, because that's what it is.

1068
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,780
It's still out there.

1069
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,060
They haven't revoked the fatwa.

1070
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,180
So I'm still under fatwa from the PSU faculty union.

1071
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,580
And then my department chair, Melody Valdini,

1072
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,220
commissioned a report from some of our senior colleagues

1073
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,500
about how I could be shut down, what

1074
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,220
they could do to curtail me or silence me,

1075
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,500
included things like forcing me to never say

1076
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,500
I was a PSU faculty member.

1077
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:30,060
And passing a faculty resolution condemning my research

1078
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:34,500
and requiring me to pre-notify the faculty chair any time

1079
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,900
I was about to publish an article or an essay that

1080
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,180
might potentially be controversial.

1081
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,060
Only me would be subject to this.

1082
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:49,660
She then convenes a secret meeting of everyone except me

1083
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,460
to talk about this.

1084
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,180
And then they have a departmental meeting

1085
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,860
to vote on it, which I don't go to.

1086
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,540
Neither does one of my senior colleagues

1087
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,180
who thinks the whole thing is obnoxious.

1088
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,540
And the resolution passes.

1089
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,140
You just can't make it up.

1090
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,140
You can't make it up.

1091
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,220
So according to my faculty right now,

1092
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,180
I'm subject to these special burdens.

1093
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,980
I'm not supposed to say I work at Portland State.

1094
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,260
I'm supposed to notify my chair any time

1095
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,500
about to write something controversial.

1096
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,300
And I'm not supposed to engage further in the colonialism

1097
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,380
debate in the classroom.

1098
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,220
You can see how closely I've abided by that, right?

1099
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,780
Because they're completely out of line.

1100
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:33,820
But what does this tell you?

1101
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:37,460
I mean, so this isn't this passed by a majority

1102
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,820
of vote of my own department.

1103
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,260
You're tenured and you're a senior.

1104
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,500
Of course I'm fully tenured, yeah.

1105
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,980
Well, I just want to make clear.

1106
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,820
Then you're a full professor.

1107
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,820
Yeah, then that department chair tried

1108
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,740
to prevent me getting post-tenure reviews.

1109
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,460
OK, so can we talk about that?

1110
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,780
I find that fascinating.

1111
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,940
So last time I looked, and I haven't looked recently,

1112
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,060
there was a list of faculty member.

1113
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,620
And I don't know the metrics for this.

1114
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,740
I would imagine that just you aggregate something

1115
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,620
from Google Scholar.

1116
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:10,180
But I don't really know of the people who most

1117
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,700
published in the university.

1118
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,660
Your name is consistently in the top 10.

1119
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,940
Consistently in the top 10.

1120
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,700
And the only one in our department,

1121
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,380
the only one in our school of government,

1122
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,100
the only one of two in our college.

1123
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:27,700
OK, and we can edit this out if this is too revealing.

1124
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,740
Wasn't the thing about the post-tenure review

1125
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,860
they said you didn't publish enough?

1126
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,340
There was something in there about that, wasn't it?

1127
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,540
Yes, yes, yes.

1128
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,780
My publication record was insufficient.

1129
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,460
Of course, it's since tenure, right?

1130
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,900
But I'd published a lot since getting tenure.

1131
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,140
Four journal articles.

1132
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,180
More than Clotting Gay.

1133
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,820
Three books.

1134
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,260
And the argument was, but the real argument

1135
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,980
was the case for colonialism discredited all

1136
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,260
of my prior scholarship because it was just clickbait

1137
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,980
for right-wing websites.

1138
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:08,260
And the fact that it had been withdrawn just showed

1139
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,300
it was academically flawed.

1140
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,540
In other words, intentionally ignoring

1141
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,620
the facts of the case about why it was withdrawn, which

1142
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,860
was not any problem with the peer review process.

1143
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,740
Physical safety of the staff was why it was withdrawn.

1144
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,100
It had nothing to do with the academic.

1145
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,700
And then she had the temerity to say,

1146
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,260
all those citations to the case for colonialism

1147
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:34,460
are really just evidence of an academic network

1148
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,220
trying to boost his citation count.

1149
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,100
And no, look at the citations.

1150
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:44,180
They're from gender studies and coloniality weekly.

1151
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,740
They're all mostly critical citations.

1152
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,940
But whatever, my job as an academic

1153
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,340
is to stimulate others to think more.

1154
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,700
And citations reflect.

1155
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,940
I'm glad you look at it, by the way.

1156
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,060
I'm glad you look at it like that.

1157
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,620
Citations reflect the extent to which people feel your work

1158
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,260
engages them, whether for good or for bad.

1159
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,380
Yeah, by the way, just as a parenthetical,

1160
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,980
the conceptual penis is a social construct.

1161
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:10,100
Most papers in the humanity, I think it's some.

1162
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:16,300
So this is a little fuzzy because someone, when this originally

1163
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,100
came out, they mixed commentary, as you said before.

1164
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:27,980
But I think 75% percent of papers in the humanities

1165
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,420
are cited between zero and one times.

1166
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,700
So that's amazing.

1167
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,180
The conceptual penis has been cited.

1168
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,980
I don't even know how many times, but dozens of times.

1169
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,540
Well, now it has an afterlife.

1170
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,900
It has an afterlife.

1171
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:39,900
But so here's.

1172
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,620
Because it's now cited as an article that

1173
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,740
was a hoax article as part of the discussion on epistemiology.

1174
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,060
Which is still cited.

1175
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:55,020
I think it's in the top 1% or higher of all gender studies

1176
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,500
articles.

1177
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,660
It's crazy.

1178
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,460
So I'm one of the most cited gender studies

1179
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,340
scholars of all time.

1180
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,060
But I just, before.

1181
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,060
You dick.

1182
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:08,780
I can't help myself.

1183
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,660
OK, so I want to talk about, because I've

1184
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,780
been thinking about this.

1185
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,220
Before we delve into the case of colonialism,

1186
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,100
I want to talk about what you're saying about the citations.

1187
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:22,140
Because I don't think that's a particularly good.

1188
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,540
I think it's a very broad metric.

1189
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,660
Because again, I only want to go to Claudine Gaye right now.

1190
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,820
Because I've read her stuff.

1191
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,660
And her stuff has hundreds of citations.

1192
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,140
I think my most cited article is like 500 and something.

1193
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,460
It's like behaviorism, constructivism, and saccharic

1194
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,900
pedigar or something.

1195
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,580
But her stuff is picked up by a bunch

1196
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,340
of all these race hucksters.

1197
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,180
They just cite their own things.

1198
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:47,180
And it artificially props up the citation rate.

1199
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,380
So you can't just look at the h-index

1200
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,380
or the number of citations.

1201
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,980
And that's, I mean, it kind of tells you something.

1202
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,460
But it kind of does not tell you something.

1203
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,180
It's what we call a rough indicator, right?

1204
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:57,860
It's a rough indicator.

1205
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,460
It's a rough indicator that has a lot

1206
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,100
of what we call reliability problems.

1207
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,700
Which means there's a lot of noise in that indicator, right?

1208
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,860
So it is probably generally tracking

1209
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,700
scholarly productivity.

1210
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,940
But there's a lot of noise in that indicator

1211
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,020
because of the sorts of things you talk about.

1212
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,740
Where you publish, whether it just

1213
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:20,020
takes one other scholar to cite it in a way

1214
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:23,300
that it becomes a kind of what we call a reflexive citation

1215
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,100
for others.

1216
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,620
Like every time you write about topic X, you cite this one.

1217
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,940
And none of those people have ever read your article.

1218
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,420
It's called a junk citation.

1219
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,900
If you become a junk citation, your citation

1220
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,060
goes off the charts because everyone just

1221
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,860
feels they need to cite you.

1222
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,460
So every time someone writes an article about topic X,

1223
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,300
they always throw this in.

1224
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,180
It's a junk citation.

1225
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:42,860
They never read it.

1226
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,980
They never thought about it.

1227
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:44,940
But it's just there.

1228
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,380
So there's a lot of noise on the upside.

1229
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,580
There's a lot of noise on the downside, too.

1230
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:54,020
So some really important articles don't get cited much

1231
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,540
because people end up not citing the original or even

1232
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,980
knowing that was the original.

1233
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,660
Because it's someone else who talked about that issue, who

1234
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,020
gets all the citations.

1235
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,060
So you can be deflated down and you can be deflated up.

1236
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:08,980
Yeah, it's good.

1237
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,380
I think I like the idea that it's rough.

1238
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,140
I mean, I remember when I went up for promotion,

1239
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:17,620
I had a higher H index than anybody on my committee

1240
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,020
than my department chair, everyone.

1241
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:23,740
And again, I think that there's a kind of anti-meritocratic

1242
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:26,580
element, particularly operative at PSU.

1243
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,500
OK, so anyway, back to the case for colonialism.

1244
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,940
So you can kind of, or you can figure out

1245
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,100
the thesis from the title.

1246
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,460
This is not a particularly complicated thing.

1247
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,580
And I think because it was so easy to grasp,

1248
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:43,700
that people picked up on it and just went completely bananas.

1249
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,700
So when you started the interview off,

1250
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,620
when I said you sat down with my son and I,

1251
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:53,700
and you explained it to me, and it was like a massive light bulb.

1252
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,220
Do you remember that conversation?

1253
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:55,940
Yeah.

1254
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:01,140
And so could you explain in a nutshell for people

1255
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,900
who are not familiar with historical colonialism,

1256
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,740
like what in a nutshell is the case for colonialism?

1257
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,980
And why does it matter that people,

1258
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,620
beyond the academic controversies,

1259
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,660
like why does this subject matter?

1260
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,460
So the easiest way to think about the case for colonialism

1261
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,740
is it's a bit like saying the case for oxygen in the atmosphere.

1262
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,180
Like, do you really think we'd be here

1263
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,740
if there were no oxygen in the atmosphere?

1264
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:32,900
Colonialism wasn't a bunch of people in pith hats

1265
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,740
jumping into a ship with guns and say,

1266
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,380
let's go repress and conquer black people.

1267
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,340
Colonialism was part of a huge structural transformation

1268
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,740
of the world that began with the rise of Europe

1269
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,860
and the separation of European development from the rest.

1270
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,420
The great divergence it's called in economic history,

1271
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:53,020
when the Europe just took off politically, economically,

1272
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,660
socially, organizationally, militarily, technologically.

1273
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,300
Suddenly this huge gap emerged between Europe and the rest.

1274
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,020
Now, when is that post-Renaissance?

1275
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:07,860
So 17th, 1600s, basically, early 1600s.

1276
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:11,700
I mean, Britain's first colonies are like Bermuda, 1603.

1277
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,180
This is the first time, the Spanish and the Portuguese.

1278
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,580
And then this accelerates all the way through the 19th century

1279
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,300
into the early 20th century.

1280
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:24,860
So Europe was spreading out whether you liked it or not.

1281
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,580
So this is the first thing to remember.

1282
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,940
People assume there's some kind of volunteerism all the time.

1283
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,900
They decided, they sat down and said,

1284
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,740
let's go colonize the world.

1285
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,620
Never happened.

1286
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,700
Europe spread out because it had things to trade.

1287
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,740
It had guns.

1288
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,580
It had shipping technology.

1289
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,740
It had missionaries.

1290
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,180
It had explorers.

1291
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,820
It had scientists.

1292
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:49,300
It had people who were interested in establishing

1293
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,380
understanding of foreign cultures.

1294
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:54,220
All this was going to happen no matter

1295
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,860
whether governments were part of it or not.

1296
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,460
Europe was coming for the world.

1297
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,060
It was going to engage the world.

1298
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,500
So that's the first thing to remember.

1299
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,100
What we call the push factors were not governments

1300
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,300
like planning colonial expeditions.

1301
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:12,180
It was simply this massively advanced civilization

1302
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,740
expanding around the world.

1303
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:19,300
Second part, on the demand side, almost always,

1304
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,820
these people were welcomed.

1305
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,740
The relationships were friendly.

1306
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,540
Why?

1307
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,740
Because the Europeans offered things that were useful.

1308
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,060
They brought food.

1309
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,300
They brought metal.

1310
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,900
They brought technology.

1311
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,620
They often brought protection from a local rival.

1312
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:37,100
I mean, the way that Nigeria became a British colony

1313
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,660
is basically that the king of Lagos

1314
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:43,300
had been chased off his throne by internal rivals.

1315
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,060
And he asked the British to come on shore

1316
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,140
and put him back on his seat.

1317
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,580
And his local ally said, yes, please come.

1318
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,860
And for God's sake, colonize us.

1319
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:55,180
Because otherwise, we're going to be swamped and degraded

1320
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:58,460
and enslaved by this group that's slightly to the north of us.

1321
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,740
And that's the common pattern of how European colonialism

1322
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,860
was established, was we call these the pull factors.

1323
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:10,700
Local populations almost always welcomed, collaborated with,

1324
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,740
cooperated with, or at least accommodated,

1325
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,060
the European expansion.

1326
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:21,340
So the idea of force and resistance is nonsense.

1327
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,700
It's not a historically accurate picture

1328
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:28,820
of how Europe came to occupy through colonial control,

1329
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,060
depending on how you look at it, 2-thirds or 3-quarters

1330
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,260
of the globe.

1331
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,540
So in part, there's no case to be made

1332
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,620
other than it's like the case for volcanoes or something.

1333
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,820
Like, we don't decide whether or not

1334
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,260
there are volcanoes in the world.

1335
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,540
There just are.

1336
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,340
Colonialism was of that sort.

1337
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,100
It just was going to happen.

1338
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,540
It's a classic example of civilizational rise

1339
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,820
and expansion that's happened throughout human history.

1340
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,300
OK, so what about this guy?

1341
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,780
Wasn't King Leopold like a real, I mean,

1342
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:00,860
my conception is he's a real, just a true, nasty son

1343
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,180
of a bitch who used to chop off?

1344
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,100
No, no, all wrong.

1345
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,580
In fact, I have an article.

1346
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,420
One of the chapters is called Indefensive Leopold's Congo.

1347
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,900
So most people's understanding of the Congo Free State,

1348
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,900
which was before the Belgian takeover of that.

1349
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:19,420
So this was a private colony rather than a Belgian colony,

1350
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:23,460
it comes from Adam Haas Child's book, King Leopold's Ghost,

1351
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:26,100
which I've shown is a vast fabrication.

1352
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:26,500
It's strange.

1353
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,780
There was no population.

1354
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,740
I have to tell you this, the way where I got that from

1355
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:39,260
is my kid, my son, I'm actually his name,

1356
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:47,500
brought home papers in his senior year from that book.

1357
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,540
And that's where I read it.

1358
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,700
And that's where I got that.

1359
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,060
So he got that in the schools.

1360
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,300
Yeah, so I just wanted to tell you.

1361
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:56,460
So Haas Child had an incredibly deleterious impact

1362
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,780
on our understanding of the Congo Free State with his book,

1363
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:03,140
King Leopold's Ghost, 1998.

1364
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:08,020
So the way I, so here's the facts about the Congo Free State

1365
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:12,500
is it was an ungoverned and ungovernable part of Africa

1366
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,900
that none of the colonial powers could enter.

1367
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:19,060
Because A, the mortality rates were about 20% per year

1368
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:23,660
for a European there because of disease and climate.

1369
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:27,020
Slave trading and inter-tribal warfare was rampant.

1370
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,980
Even the British could not stop the slave trading

1371
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,180
in the central Congo.

1372
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,420
Those slaves were taken to Eastern Africa

1373
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,980
and onto the Arab area.

1374
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,980
So this is the East African slave trade run

1375
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,140
by the Arabs and the Indians.

1376
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:45,140
And King Leopold said, let me try to establish

1377
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,820
at least some trading stations

1378
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,220
and some navigable rivers there.

1379
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,460
That was the deal, okay?

1380
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:55,460
Now, King Leopold's Congo managed to create a railway

1381
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,740
up into the central part of the country

1382
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,980
and certain amount of stability

1383
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:06,620
by stopping slave trading and inter-tribal warfare

1384
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:09,420
with a very thin amount of people, very few, right?

1385
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,180
It's still vastly unexplored.

1386
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,900
And as a result of that population,

1387
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,460
probably slightly increased,

1388
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,860
maybe there was a decrease because of the rise

1389
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,980
of sleeping sickness and some endemic diseases

1390
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:21,980
that were coming in.

1391
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,660
But basically, it was an amazingly positive contribution

1392
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,620
to the people of the Congo.

1393
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:29,100
Now, in a very small part, about 10% of that territory,

1394
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,940
they grew rubber and instead of forced labor requirements,

1395
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,540
they imposed rubber quotas.

1396
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:36,500
So, you know, when you're running a government,

1397
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,940
you need to pay for the government.

1398
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,500
There's three ways to do it.

1399
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,700
You can tax people,

1400
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,860
but if they have no money, taxation's not feasible.

1401
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,860
Most common way to use it then is forced labor, right?

1402
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:47,860
It's called Corvée labor.

1403
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,660
You pay your taxes in terms of labor.

1404
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:54,180
In the rubber areas, the labor was demanded

1405
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,500
in terms of the delivery of rubber quotas

1406
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,100
from different villages.

1407
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,580
Now, in most of these areas, the rubber came very easily.

1408
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,260
In other parts of these rubber areas,

1409
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,300
the local militias who were hired

1410
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:11,100
by the Belgian rubber companies engaged

1411
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:14,980
in coercive practices to get the locals to bring in the rubber.

1412
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:17,340
And there were some atrocities, for sure.

1413
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:22,340
I estimate maybe 10,000 Belgian black Congolese died

1414
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,660
in skirmishers or conflicts

1415
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:29,220
between the Belgian rubber companies.

1416
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,900
Now, don't forget, these are black militias,

1417
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,140
but it's black on black conflict.

1418
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:36,660
Nonetheless, the rubber companies and the local, 10,000.

1419
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,220
Terrible number, but don't forget,

1420
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:41,260
we're talking about a country of 10 million at this point.

1421
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:42,780
And that is the worst of it.

1422
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:46,060
All those pictures you see of severed limbs are either fake,

1423
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,860
meaning those are people who had their hands cut off

1424
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,260
because of gangrene

1425
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:54,260
or because they had their hands cut off in battles

1426
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:58,180
or when you see them holding the hands of people,

1427
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,820
that's because it was tribal custom in Congo.

1428
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,700
When you were issued a rifle with 10 bullets,

1429
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,940
if you came back with only eight bullets,

1430
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,820
you needed to show that those two bullets

1431
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,620
had been used to kill others.

1432
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,180
And you would cut their hands off and the hands had showed,

1433
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,140
and this was typically soldier on soldier conflict,

1434
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:18,540
not against villagers who didn't turn in their rubber quotas.

1435
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:22,020
So the British Congo reformers realized

1436
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,820
that if they could show some pictures of people

1437
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,900
with severed hands and say this is King Leopold's

1438
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,220
rubber minions, that it would spark outrage,

1439
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,340
because what they really wanted

1440
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,060
was the Brits to colonize the Congo.

1441
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,620
And it did some, it created a movement in support of this,

1442
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:36,780
but a vast amount of lies and propaganda,

1443
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,380
which Adam Hochschild repeats in his book,

1444
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:42,980
says that 10 million people died from the British,

1445
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:45,700
from the Belgian Congolese, not the Belgian King Leopold's

1446
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,900
Congolese rubber operations, complete nonsense.

1447
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,540
And how do we know that figure is wrong?

1448
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:53,780
Because demographers in the 70s, 80s and 90s

1449
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:56,580
started to go back and do the data calculations.

1450
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:57,900
1970s, 80s and 90s.

1451
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,500
Yeah, mainly the 80s and 90s is when they finally

1452
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,020
got good enough evidence.

1453
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:06,100
And demographers estimating population,

1454
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,500
it shows the population is basically flat the whole time.

1455
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,260
Because despite the downward pressure on population

1456
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:14,420
caused by endemic disease, King Leopold's Congo

1457
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:18,540
was maintaining stability, food supplies were rising,

1458
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,580
slave operations were declining.

1459
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:23,460
So his contribution was very positive.

1460
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,340
There was a negative countervailing effect

1461
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:28,020
from endemic disease, which was coming in.

1462
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,620
And the net result was basically a flat population.

1463
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,980
Well, OK, that's fascinating, because that totally upends.

1464
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:34,660
Totally different.

1465
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:38,100
I mean, and if you try to go on Wikipedia, and correct.

1466
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,340
Well, Wikipedia is a corrupt system.

1467
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:43,380
Yeah, if you try and correct any of those fake facts

1468
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,660
on Wikipedia, you'll get immediately edited out.

1469
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,540
Which I don't do, because I know it's going to happen.

1470
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:49,860
But friends of mine who do this say that they

1471
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:51,260
keep trying to indicate.

1472
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,700
OK, now, so that's another.

1473
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,820
The corruption of Wikipedia is another story.

1474
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,700
That's a totally, I don't want to go on the road,

1475
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:57,900
Wikipedia is corrupt.

1476
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:58,860
OK, so.

1477
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:03,660
But just imagine how pernicious a myth that

1478
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:07,260
is of, because it often gets raised in this debate, right?

1479
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,060
Well, what about the Congo?

1480
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:09,540
Yeah.

1481
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,100
You know, wasn't the Congo terrible?

1482
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,020
That's what I was thinking.

1483
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,340
Yeah, no, it wasn't actually.

1484
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,180
It was amazingly positive.

1485
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,580
Black lives mattered to King Leopold.

1486
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:22,300
And he did an amazing thing to support them.

1487
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,380
And yet, and just imagine how pernicious.

1488
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:26,380
Now, I caught Adam Rothschild actually

1489
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:29,100
doctoring a quotation in his book.

1490
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,340
And he recognized he had doctored it.

1491
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,740
And he apologized and said, well, that's good.

1492
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,940
I said, I hope it gets corrected.

1493
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:36,980
Basically, he taken up.

1494
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,620
Oh, that's a good attitude.

1495
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:44,060
Yeah, but I mean, so it's just like I said, A was not A.

1496
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,620
And I'm sorry about that, but it anchored my whole tale.

1497
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:50,220
Maybe he should cancel the book or give a speech.

1498
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,740
He basically took a Belgian official who said,

1499
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:55,380
I don't think we should be going in and forcing

1500
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:58,700
coercive rubber harvesting because otherwise, we'll

1501
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:02,460
just be like the Arabs who would cut off hands and feet.

1502
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,100
He doctored that quotation to say,

1503
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,540
if we're going to do rubber harvesting,

1504
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,900
we're going to have to be cutting off hands and feet.

1505
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:11,580
Oh, that's a significant big.

1506
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,660
Completely inverted the meeting, right?

1507
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:14,020
Yeah.

1508
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,700
And that's how his book operates in my view.

1509
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,980
And it's a complete verse.

1510
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,740
So one of the things that you said

1511
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,820
that was so interesting to me, and again, this

1512
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:25,380
way outside my area of expertise, excuse me,

1513
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:30,100
is that you said, when you think about colonialism,

1514
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,700
you have to think about what the alternative is.

1515
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:37,340
And people vote with their feet and where do they go?

1516
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:41,500
And so I want you to please talk a little bit about what

1517
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,260
was the alternative and what did you

1518
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:46,580
mean by people vote with their feet?

1519
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,060
Yeah, so the alternative clearly is not

1520
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:52,460
well-governed, stable, prosperous societies.

1521
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:55,460
Nowhere that was colonized was like that.

1522
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:58,980
India, which has to take a lot of time in any analysis

1523
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,860
because it's two-thirds of the colonial experience

1524
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:05,340
because of the people, was in the midst of the collapse

1525
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,940
of the Mughal dynasty.

1526
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:10,820
And the attempt by Natar Shah of Persia

1527
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:14,660
to replace the Mughal empire with a Persian empire, which

1528
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,900
would have been much more bloody and violent.

1529
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:21,980
And these little feudal fiefdoms that

1530
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,820
were left over from the collapse of the Mughal dynasty

1531
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:27,500
were fighting amongst each other.

1532
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:30,620
So when the British showed up, the East India Company

1533
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:34,420
in the first instance showed up, started establishing forts

1534
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:37,420
that were essentially trading forts, what do you know?

1535
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:41,100
Within years, people started moving closer to the fort.

1536
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,100
Why?

1537
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,620
Why would they escape the wonderful life

1538
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:50,060
of being a lower caste Hindu under a Maharaja whose job

1539
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,300
was to pick up the shit of the Hindu elites

1540
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,580
for the rest of your life and all of your generations to come?

1541
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:57,140
Why on earth would you go and live near the British East

1542
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:58,420
India Company's fort?

1543
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:01,140
A, you had security.

1544
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,940
B, you had job opportunities.

1545
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,300
C, if you were from a lower caste,

1546
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,660
you might work for the British army in a canteen.

1547
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:10,660
Hell, even cleaning their latrines would be better.

1548
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:12,340
Building their forts, you suddenly

1549
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:15,420
escape from social oppression.

1550
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:20,540
You're suddenly going to be in a modern area with access

1551
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:24,060
to technology and running water, maybe,

1552
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:26,260
because the forts started to expand, right?

1553
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,820
So people were voting with their feet already.

1554
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:30,420
Once the Indian mutiny happens, which

1555
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:33,500
is actually a small minority of the Indian troops

1556
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,460
of the East India Company, and the British decide

1557
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:38,380
the government has got out of control,

1558
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,220
like this was supposed to be a trading venture.

1559
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:41,700
It's now basically a government.

1560
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:44,460
So they formalize it becomes the government of India.

1561
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:47,740
Then we see this massive influx of Indians

1562
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:51,060
into the most heavily colonized cities, right?

1563
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:55,460
Calcutta, Hyderabad, Bombay, New Delhi.

1564
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,300
Because why?

1565
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:59,180
Why are people moving closer to colonialism

1566
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:01,580
if colonialism is so terrible for them?

1567
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,700
Shouldn't they be fleeing into the mountains?

1568
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,740
Shouldn't they abandoning the cities?

1569
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,100
No, of course they're not.

1570
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,540
They're moving closer in.

1571
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,820
They're trying to get into the English education systems.

1572
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,820
Eventually they're trying to send all their kids to Eaton,

1573
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:15,380
an oxbridge, where they become tenured professors

1574
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,420
and denounce colonialism, of course.

1575
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:21,460
But it's the hypocrisy of the anti-colonialists

1576
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:26,660
who don't want to recognize how much their forebears wanted,

1577
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:30,660
sought to be part of, engaged with, benefited from,

1578
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:33,860
and recognize the benefits of the colonial experience

1579
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:37,500
compared to what would have happened otherwise.

1580
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,740
See, that's fascinating to me.

1581
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:45,300
What do you make of this fact that in Hong Kong

1582
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,460
during the uprisings a few years ago,

1583
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:50,580
there were flying American flags?

1584
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,980
And British flags.

1585
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:54,140
Incorrect, and British flags.

1586
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:56,940
And it kind of goes...

1587
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:59,220
Melissa Chen was the person who gave me this idea.

1588
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,140
It kind of goes against that narrative.

1589
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:04,140
I think I read something she wrote about that.

1590
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:07,300
It goes against the anti-colonial narrative

1591
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,260
where these are people who are colonized

1592
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:13,420
and they're flying American and British flags.

1593
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:15,860
So there is a...

1594
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:19,620
Even to say, as you're the world expert in this,

1595
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:22,660
and you would note that there is a case for colonialism,

1596
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:31,660
even that sets people off in a kind of deranged frenzy.

1597
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:35,500
So even to make that suggestion...

1598
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:38,740
So is the reason for that, and I'm speculating...

1599
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:41,140
Tell me if my reasoning is off, my speculation is off.

1600
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:45,780
Is the reason for that because they look at...

1601
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:47,220
It's kind of like Israel in a sense.

1602
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,420
They look at Israel as a penetration of Western values.

1603
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:53,300
They look at colonialism as the penetration of Western values.

1604
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,740
And they view the West as kind of the wellspring

1605
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,140
of all things that are bad.

1606
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:00,660
Is that the basic oversimplified idea?

1607
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,780
So there is definitely a derangement syndrome going on here.

1608
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:05,940
I mean, Israel derangement syndrome,

1609
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,620
colonialism derangement syndrome,

1610
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:12,180
which you mentioned the idea and it sets them off

1611
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:16,700
in a kind of a lunatic rage of an inability

1612
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:20,820
to think constructively or dispassionately about an issue.

1613
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:22,620
And to form arguments against it too.

1614
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:23,820
That's the other part of the syndrome.

1615
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:26,140
Yeah, or to even be willing to engage

1616
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,380
in the historical evidence or debate.

1617
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:32,580
And I caught out this professor,

1618
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,780
one of those who wrote a long article against me,

1619
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,460
who was a professor, a tenure professor

1620
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,220
in African studies and whatnot.

1621
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:43,340
And I basically took his essay

1622
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,460
and found that none of the quotations he used

1623
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,860
actually said what he said they said.

1624
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:49,020
Did he publish it?

1625
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:49,860
Yes.

1626
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:50,940
Where did he publish it?

1627
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:53,460
It was an essay in the Washington Post.

1628
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:54,820
Oh, so it wasn't peer reviewed then?

1629
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,780
No, no, but I mean, he's a scholar.

1630
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:00,460
He's basically trading on his academic credentials

1631
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:01,940
and saying, well, here's the...

1632
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:03,820
Yeah, it's actually worse that it's in the Washington Post.

1633
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:06,340
It's worse, yeah, because he's saying, just trust me,

1634
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:07,580
I'm an academic.

1635
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:10,420
And here's the quote, here's the citation.

1636
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:13,380
Whoa, go through every single one.

1637
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:14,660
That's not what it says.

1638
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:15,500
That's not what it says.

1639
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,140
And he probably hasn't even read it before.

1640
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:19,060
So what is this telling you?

1641
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,380
This is telling you that it's no longer

1642
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:23,620
an area of academic inquiry,

1643
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:28,220
by which we mean evidence, data, hypothesis,

1644
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:30,300
falsification, debate, right?

1645
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,060
It's an area of ideology.

1646
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,540
It's an area of totalitarian thinking.

1647
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:37,860
And so for someone again,

1648
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:39,620
to step outside of the people,

1649
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:44,780
elicits a kind of Maoist reaction

1650
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,540
as it did in the Cultural Revolution

1651
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:48,020
and all the other Maoist movements,

1652
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:51,940
which is beat the dog when they fall in the gutter,

1653
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:53,660
as they say in Chinese, you know?

1654
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:57,220
I mean, this is just an outrage against civilization.

1655
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,340
It's a terrible expression.

1656
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:59,180
Yeah, yeah.

1657
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:09,300
But again, my normal response is, okay,

1658
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:14,340
here's my long response to all of your critiques.

1659
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:17,740
Sighted, footnoted, double-check my footnotes

1660
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:19,300
if you think what I'm saying,

1661
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,900
the evidence I'm citing doesn't say that,

1662
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:25,060
please write a rebuttal, you know, 20,000 words later.

1663
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,020
What do all those people say in response?

1664
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:30,660
Nada.

1665
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:34,500
Because it's not really an academic topic anymore, right?

1666
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:38,700
And to even say all of your evidence

1667
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:43,700
that you've mustered against me is like tofu construction,

1668
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,140
another Chinese phrase.

1669
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:50,300
For them it's like saying Claudia Gay plagiarized.

1670
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:54,220
Even to raise that white Eurocentric perspective

1671
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:56,420
is just evidence of your white supremacy.

1672
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:58,140
You don't get it.

1673
01:10:58,140 --> 01:10:59,380
The ship has sailed.

1674
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,460
The ideology is correct.

1675
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:03,580
If you didn't get on board with the ideology

1676
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:07,260
and you keep raising these old liberal shibboleths against it,

1677
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:10,940
it just shows how deeply entrenched the problems are in you,

1678
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:12,060
not me.

1679
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,660
Yeah, it's disparaging

1680
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:17,340
because that's the dominant moral orthodoxy right now.

1681
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:20,380
That's currently what's in fashion.

1682
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,860
And it's not as if,

1683
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:27,700
it's not only as if a certain conclusion was orthodox,

1684
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,940
it's a process to get to the conclusion.

1685
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:32,260
It's the demeaning of evidence.

1686
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,060
It's the demeaning of reason.

1687
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:38,380
It's the wholesale writing off of datasets.

1688
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:41,980
And so that makes the problem much more difficult to solve.

1689
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:44,780
It's not like, well, we know the earth is warming

1690
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:46,380
or anthropogenic warming, et cetera.

1691
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:47,260
So what do we do about it?

1692
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:49,740
Those are political considerations based upon dataset.

1693
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:51,580
It's you just wipe out the whole dataset.

1694
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,580
So then you're in, la la la.

1695
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:54,980
Because what are you interested in?

1696
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:55,980
Truth or power?

1697
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:56,900
Correct, right?

1698
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,860
If you're interested in truth,

1699
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,500
you're constantly trying to revise,

1700
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,420
are we doing this right?

1701
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:02,580
What's the evidence?

1702
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:04,260
If you're interested in power,

1703
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,220
the truth question doesn't come into it.

1704
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:11,220
What ideology will be effective as a tool of us gaining

1705
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,140
and maintaining and using power?

1706
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:14,420
That's the question, right?

1707
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:19,420
So anti-colonialism then became decolonization,

1708
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:21,940
then became post-colonialism.

1709
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,980
All of these things, it turns out,

1710
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:26,020
had nothing to do with truth.

1711
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:28,140
They were ideologies of power.

1712
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,180
First, they were ideologies of power

1713
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,620
for the people in the colonies

1714
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:33,980
who wanted to take over from the colonial rulers.

1715
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:35,260
They'd sit there, look at government houses,

1716
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:37,220
saying, wow, it'd be great to sleep there.

1717
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,940
Sit there and sip whiskies all day,

1718
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:40,100
and I'd be served upon.

1719
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,980
I'd probably retain some of those white staff

1720
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:44,380
so I could be served by a white staff member.

1721
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:45,820
I mean, the people would go crazy

1722
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,900
to see a black man served by a white man.

1723
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:53,900
Then decolonization, which was taking these societies

1724
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:58,060
that had a rule of law, a court system, a high court,

1725
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:01,980
property rights, guaranteed freedoms,

1726
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,820
a meritocratic education system.

1727
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:07,020
Decolonize went, I'm taking all that over.

1728
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,340
I'm nationalizing the cocoa industry.

1729
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:12,500
I'm suspending the habeas corpus.

1730
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,260
I'm seizing property, right?

1731
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:15,620
That was decolonization.

1732
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:19,780
It was not an ideology of public policy.

1733
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:22,580
It was an ideology of power and resources.

1734
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:23,420
Fascinating.

1735
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:25,260
And then post-colonialism became the same thing.

1736
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:27,380
Post-colonialism was to say,

1737
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:31,860
we cannot use the rational European way

1738
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:33,700
of thinking about the world.

1739
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,740
We can't expect brown and black people to think that way.

1740
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:39,380
We need to adopt a post-colonial perspective

1741
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,700
so that we don't hold them to those same standards.

1742
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,780
This is a properly post-colonial view

1743
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:45,620
on what you should have

1744
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:47,380
in order to be the president of Harvard.

1745
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:51,420
Claudine Gay perfectly fits that post-colonial perspective.

1746
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:56,180
She wasn't elevated on merit or metrics or competence.

1747
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:58,780
That's the colonial mindset we need to decolonize.

1748
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:01,180
And we need to have a post-colonial Harvard president.

1749
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:02,220
And she was it.

1750
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:06,100
And she was glamorous and perfect post-colonialism at Harvard.

1751
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,620
It's been decolonized.

1752
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,340
And there it is in its full glory.

1753
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:10,660
And that's what you get.

1754
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,780
Yeah, I actually agree with them.

1755
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,460
I was really disappointed.

1756
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:17,420
I mean, Claudine Gay is the president Harvard deserves.

1757
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:21,380
And I was very much disappointed when she resigned.

1758
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:24,260
I think I was genuinely she's the president.

1759
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:25,900
She's a perfect fit for the university.

1760
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:26,740
I couldn't agree.

1761
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,580
Perfect fit.

1762
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,420
I couldn't agree more.

1763
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,260
She's keeping her knowledge.

1764
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:32,140
It is the modern decolonized anti-racist university.

1765
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:35,660
And I could show you 100 institutes

1766
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:37,500
of higher education in the third world

1767
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,780
that went through exactly that process

1768
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:41,540
after the end of the colonial era.

1769
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:44,420
And the presidency was seized by some party

1770
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:47,220
hack who could barely spell his name.

1771
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:50,820
And the research departments were given to party hacks

1772
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,300
who were not the best in their field.

1773
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,700
I mean, this was the Soviet Union, right?

1774
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,140
We're all, I mean, the Soviet Union,

1775
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:59,580
the Russian scientific and mathematical tradition

1776
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:02,460
used to be unparalleled, top in the world, right?

1777
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:03,820
Until the Soviet Union.

1778
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:07,700
And all that academic excellence was replaced by ideology.

1779
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:10,100
So what it took to be the head of the university was

1780
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,180
you had to be a good party cadre.

1781
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:14,740
What it took to be the head of the agronomics department

1782
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:17,220
was you believed in some quack theory

1783
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,080
that some party hack had invented

1784
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,980
and that was the only route to the top.

1785
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:27,140
So it seems that, well, two things.

1786
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:32,020
Why should someone read the case for colonialism?

1787
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:33,980
So I start with that one.

1788
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:37,420
Yeah, so I think the book brings together

1789
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:40,260
the logical evidence-based arguments.

1790
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:45,260
And it does so not in the sort of thematic chapter by chapter,

1791
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,620
but using what I call episodes of colonialism.

1792
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,180
So I look at specific cases.

1793
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,660
I look at Malaya.

1794
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:53,220
I look at Yemen.

1795
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:54,260
I look at India.

1796
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:56,260
I look at the Congo.

1797
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,580
I look at German colonies.

1798
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:02,740
I look at specific instances where colonialism took place

1799
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:07,980
because I find it a lot easier to deal with instances,

1800
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,940
places rather than themes.

1801
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,620
I think it's more accessible.

1802
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:16,620
So, and then it's forwarded by the broad thematic arguments.

1803
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:20,740
And at the end, I bring in responses to colonialism

1804
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:22,820
from two of the great third world intellectuals,

1805
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:26,260
Chinua Kebei, which was the article I published,

1806
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:29,780
expanded, revised, and then one on V.S. Nipal,

1807
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:33,060
who's the Nobel Laureate writer from Trinidad.

1808
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:34,580
His book blew me away.

1809
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,620
Who was, to me, one of the greatest writers

1810
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:37,460
of the 20th century.

1811
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,300
Yeah, totally blew my life.

1812
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,700
And was only very reluctantly given the Nobel Prize

1813
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,260
because at a certain point,

1814
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:45,300
even the woke Nobel committee could not ignore

1815
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,060
this man's greatness.

1816
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,980
And they tried to spin him as an anticolonial writer,

1817
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:49,820
which he wasn't.

1818
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:54,500
So I think if you want to kind of,

1819
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,660
and here's what I would say about my book.

1820
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,260
I'm not an, on the one hand,

1821
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:00,100
on the other hand, type of person.

1822
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:03,940
I think colonialism was an unmitigated good.

1823
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:07,780
That doesn't mean during this entire period of colonialism,

1824
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:09,340
a lot of bad stuff didn't happen.

1825
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,180
Of course it did.

1826
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:12,100
We're talking about human societies.

1827
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,500
If there was not bad stuff,

1828
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,020
it wouldn't be a human society.

1829
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:20,020
What I mean was at the level of the general systemic factors

1830
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:23,700
that brought colonialism to being and how it operated

1831
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,220
and what it left behind,

1832
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:28,060
all of that unmitigated good, okay?

1833
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,420
So, and I think that's what distinguishes my book

1834
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:32,740
from my colleague Nigel Bigger's book,

1835
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:34,740
Colonials and Memorial Reckoning.

1836
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:36,580
Fantastic book.

1837
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:38,420
Dr. Bigger, on the other hand,

1838
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:42,340
trying very hard to be that terrible tick

1839
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:45,540
in the British personality, reasonable, dear fellow.

1840
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,500
Reasonable, right?

1841
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,980
And he is reasonable.

1842
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:52,660
And so he does try to give more fair play

1843
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,620
to critical arguments.

1844
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:59,220
I just think he's trying a bit too hard to be reasonable

1845
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:02,700
in that British manner of not to sure about anything,

1846
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:05,860
very practical, you know, I call this the hobbit mentality

1847
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:08,980
of like, no adventures and no big theories.

1848
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:10,420
So I respect him a lot,

1849
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:13,180
but it's really not an argument for colonialism his book is.

1850
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:15,860
It's more of a introduction to the debate.

1851
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:18,140
Mine is the only, and I would say the same

1852
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:19,740
about Nigel Ferguson's book, Empire.

1853
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:20,940
Oh, I love that book.

1854
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,780
Which is great, which is fantastic

1855
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:25,580
because he really does bring in a lot of the detail.

1856
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,980
He also has a kind of thematic introduction.

1857
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:29,220
I have a signed copy of that.

1858
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:32,140
The five, whatever he calls them, the five super apps

1859
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,740
of Western civilization, property rights, markets,

1860
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:36,220
you know, whatever.

1861
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:38,900
But Ferguson's also one of those too clever by,

1862
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:41,620
what they call too clever by half in the UK, right?

1863
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:42,940
He's a brilliant guy, right?

1864
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:45,940
And he's so brilliant that he can't help

1865
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:48,100
but throwing in all kinds of little insults

1866
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,940
and nastinesses about British colonialism

1867
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:54,060
because to be a real intellectual

1868
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:56,100
in the British tradition, like bigger,

1869
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,220
need to be balanced, right?

1870
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:59,100
Need to be on the one hand on the other hand.

1871
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,340
Although his general argument is colonialism was great

1872
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:04,220
and British Empire created the modern world.

1873
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:06,940
Both of them in my mind are a little bit too much of a um,

1874
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:08,900
um, on the one hand on the other hand.

1875
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,020
So if you want a book that simply says,

1876
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:12,820
here's the case and here's the evidence

1877
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:15,140
and here's why I disagree with these arguments against it.

1878
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:16,660
Mine's the only one.

1879
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:18,820
All right, that's fascinating.

1880
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:21,180
So, so let me ask you this.

1881
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:25,380
You are in the twilight of your career,

1882
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:27,620
would you say that's fair to say?

1883
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:28,460
Yes.

1884
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:32,180
And you were approximately the same age

1885
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:35,500
and you're going on sabbatical next term.

1886
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,500
You're at an institution

1887
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,860
where the vast majority of people despise you.

1888
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:43,060
Is that fair to say?

1889
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:45,260
Yeah, I think so.

1890
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:47,300
At least in the humanities and social sciences.

1891
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,140
Sure, sure.

1892
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:53,780
So what's next for you?

1893
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:57,340
I mean, what's next for you?

1894
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:02,220
Well, I think there's always this dilemma of

1895
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:06,860
when do you leave a sinking ship?

1896
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,020
And I answered that question.

1897
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:11,860
You answered that question.

1898
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:14,500
And I don't mean Portland State is sinking.

1899
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,620
It's a state institution.

1900
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:17,180
It'll survive in one form or another.

1901
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:19,780
But what I mean is if the intellectual environment

1902
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:21,460
is sinking, it disappeared.

1903
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:22,620
It's sunk.

1904
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:24,220
Then what point do you abandon

1905
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:29,220
or what point do you say they should triple my salary?

1906
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,900
I'm the only thing.

1907
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:31,740
Correct.

1908
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:34,260
One of the only things keeping this place

1909
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:36,660
to some degree intellectually honest.

1910
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:41,300
So to what extent do you say I gotta stay?

1911
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:44,340
Not because I care about the institution itself per se,

1912
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:47,700
but because anywhere else I went, right,

1913
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,300
any other university would have some degree

1914
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,220
of the same problems.

1915
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,380
And the extent that it didn't,

1916
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:54,100
I would say, well, I'm just replicating what's,

1917
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,620
I mean, if there were a place

1918
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,700
like the Stanford Business School,

1919
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:01,100
which has created a vigorous classical liberalism series,

1920
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:02,220
of course, it's in the business school,

1921
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:04,420
not the film school,

1922
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:07,460
you would say, well, the work's already been done here.

1923
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:09,500
The problem, as I see it is,

1924
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,900
the problem with you staying there,

1925
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,740
it kind of legitimizes them when they don't deserve it.

1926
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:15,780
Right?

1927
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,500
I mean, have you thought about the idea that,

1928
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,700
and I'm just totally tossing it out there,

1929
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:20,780
like the University of Austin

1930
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:23,060
is gonna do a debate and speaker series.

1931
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:24,780
I think you'd be a fantastic person.

1932
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:27,500
I think you could go on the road and debate this,

1933
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:30,420
and I think you'd draw huge audiences.

1934
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,660
Also though, keep in mind,

1935
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:34,220
and you will know this too, from being in the classroom,

1936
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:35,420
is there's a huge difference

1937
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:37,660
between the students and the faculty.

1938
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,220
Oh, absolutely, right, 100%.

1939
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:40,860
Students, even the students

1940
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:44,140
who ultimately are very woke, very left wing,

1941
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:45,580
they're still curious.

1942
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:47,020
They still wanna listen.

1943
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,780
They still wanna hear from you.

1944
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:52,060
They still wanna have a discussion after class.

1945
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:57,060
They actually, so what is the experience

1946
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:01,580
as a faculty member in an American woke University?

1947
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:05,180
Well, it's true that your experience with your colleagues

1948
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:06,380
is a big part of it,

1949
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:07,860
because you're working together with them,

1950
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:09,020
and they shape the environment,

1951
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:10,940
and they pass resolutions against you.

1952
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:11,780
But on the other hand,

1953
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:12,620
your experience with the students

1954
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:16,340
is also a big part of what you're living through,

1955
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:18,460
and I love my students,

1956
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,140
and I love being in the classroom with them,

1957
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:23,380
and I find them very open-minded and curious

1958
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:25,340
and interested to hear different perspectives.

1959
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:28,980
And the fact that they would go to your class at all

1960
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:32,340
would probably mean that either like you or they hate you,

1961
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,020
but almost no one would have heard of it.

1962
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,900
Right, they get to select, right?

1963
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,620
So if they're really opposed, they just won't come,

1964
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,340
but a lot of them do,

1965
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:43,660
and the only problem students I ever have

1966
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,580
are actually the graduate students

1967
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:49,340
who have decided they're on the side of justice

1968
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,100
and they're marching for the revolution.

1969
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,740
I quote one of them in my book,

1970
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:56,660
a guy who was going on to do a PhD

1971
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:59,140
and was saying that I have to make clarifying remarks

1972
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:02,820
in my letters that I in no way was in solidarity

1973
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:04,540
with Dr. Gilley.

1974
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:07,620
You can tell by the language where he was coming from,

1975
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,060
but he's the outlier.

1976
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:13,020
I mean, the students, which is ultimately, you know,

1977
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,220
in terms of your daily experience,

1978
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:18,420
shapes your daily experience,

1979
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:19,700
I have no problem with my students,

1980
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,420
and they have no problem with me.

1981
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:23,660
So what's next for you?

1982
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:24,660
What are you gonna do?

1983
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,860
Well, I think partly we're all waiting to see

1984
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:30,140
what happens to higher education in the next year.

1985
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:31,580
Well, we know what's gonna happen.

1986
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:34,020
Well, maybe we do, maybe we don't.

1987
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:38,300
I think there has to be a reckoning,

1988
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,940
especially now.

1989
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:43,260
It's not just the Claudine Gay question

1990
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:47,380
and the DEI bans that some states are passing.

1991
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:50,980
And it's not also, it's not only the plagiarism questions.

1992
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:54,100
And plagiarism, it's also the enrollment decline.

1993
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:58,300
It's the demographic cusp, cliff.

1994
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,700
They call it the demographic cliff

1995
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:01,500
that they're all about to fall off.

1996
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:05,180
It's the donors, it's the funding, right?

1997
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:06,580
It's the college debt.

1998
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:08,020
I mean, it's all of that,

1999
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:11,540
which has to lead to some reformulation of the university.

2000
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:13,700
And then the question is,

2001
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:16,100
what's the business model going forward?

2002
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:20,820
Because we know that universities thrive

2003
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:22,340
when they get the best students, right?

2004
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:24,420
Because universities are basically,

2005
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:28,660
they live off their signaling, right?

2006
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:30,860
The reason they hire great faculty

2007
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:33,220
is not because those faculty know how to teach.

2008
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:35,700
Often they're terrible teachers.

2009
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:39,140
And the reason they love getting great students

2010
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,860
is not necessarily because those students

2011
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:43,220
are the most socially minded and positive,

2012
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:46,700
but because everyone wants to go somewhere

2013
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,420
where there's a bunch of smart people, right?

2014
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:50,300
That's the university brand,

2015
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:53,660
is we're taking you to a new level when you come here,

2016
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:56,060
surrounded by smart people on campus

2017
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:57,340
that you can learn from.

2018
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:00,500
So to the extent that someone like Claudine,

2019
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,020
think of the damage of a Claudine Gay case

2020
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:05,180
against the Harvard brand, right?

2021
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:09,140
Your president is not only academically incompetent

2022
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:11,940
and administratively stupid, but she's a plagiarist, right?

2023
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,100
11 citations.

2024
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:16,460
Yeah, I mean, it's just amazing damage to the brand

2025
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:19,740
in terms of what universities are supposed to offer to students.

2026
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,420
And we're gonna keep wrong faculty.

2027
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:22,540
Correct me if I'm wrong,

2028
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:25,300
and I'm pretty sure this is the case, but I'm not positive.

2029
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:28,420
I read the metrics of Portland State

2030
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:31,340
accepts 98% of its applicants.

2031
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:34,660
98%, so how intellectually rigorous could it possibly be

2032
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:36,700
when they only reject 2%?

2033
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:39,500
Like anyone with a pulse should be able to get in there.

2034
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:40,980
Yeah, so admission is easy, right?

2035
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:43,260
So you're talking about the bottom of the ladder.

2036
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,740
The bottom of the bottom of the barrel.

2037
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,660
Of course, you still have to pass classes, right?

2038
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:49,540
You still have to succeed.

2039
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:51,500
And there's some debate about

2040
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:53,180
whether that's even very difficult anymore.

2041
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:56,060
But as you move up in the ecosystem.

2042
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,940
The average grade, I think in some places,

2043
01:25:57,940 --> 01:25:59,380
I remember I looked into this a while ago,

2044
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:03,060
it's a, when I did my dissertation,

2045
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:07,460
I think it was A minus in, I'm not sure,

2046
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:09,940
but I think it's in the A minus is the average range.

2047
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:12,620
It varies obviously by college and department.

2048
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:14,300
Think philosophy is a little lower than that.

2049
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,740
But so anybody, almost anybody can get in.

2050
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,140
I wonder who those 2% are.

2051
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,340
Like literally they must, I just can't even imagine.

2052
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:23,660
And then once you get in, you kind of sail.

2053
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:26,340
Like I think the average grade of Harvard now is an A.

2054
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:27,940
So like once you get in, you're sailing.

2055
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:32,260
But keep in mind what colleges and universities

2056
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:35,260
should be judged upon is the value added.

2057
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:37,420
They provide to students, right?

2058
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:40,780
So last time I looked at the data

2059
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:43,060
for a university like Portland State,

2060
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:45,740
it was actually doing pretty good about average,

2061
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:47,540
adding value to its students.

2062
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:49,300
In other words, the SAT and then this.

2063
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:50,820
Yeah, yeah, you look at their trajectory

2064
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:51,900
coming out of high school.

2065
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:53,140
Yeah, yeah.

2066
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:56,100
And where a typical American will end up earning twice

2067
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,740
with that kind of trajectory.

2068
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:01,020
The universities can deflate it or inflate it, right?

2069
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:02,860
If they add value, what they say is

2070
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:05,460
they take someone who barely graduated high school,

2071
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:08,820
has very little confidence in their intellectual abilities,

2072
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:10,900
never really learn to write.

2073
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,940
Portland State or a place like Portland State,

2074
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:16,540
if they're doing a good job, takes them and says, look,

2075
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:19,740
you can do this, you have an intellectual spark,

2076
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:21,900
you need some confidence, you need some writing,

2077
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:23,420
you need to be introduced to reading,

2078
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:25,980
you need to be introduced to skill-based building.

2079
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:28,260
And at the end of the day, you are on trajectory

2080
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:29,940
to be below the poverty line.

2081
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:32,220
You're now in the middle class, okay?

2082
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:33,060
Whereas a Harvard-

2083
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:34,140
That's good, that's a great accomplishment.

2084
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:37,020
Yeah, whereas a Harvard might take a high flyer

2085
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:39,860
who should have a mansion at Martha's Vineyard

2086
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:44,660
and turn them into a down and out computer programmer

2087
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:49,140
in Scranton, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

2088
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:51,900
because they took away value

2089
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:54,340
by telling them they should get involved in this

2090
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:56,540
or saying skills don't matter or whatever.

2091
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:59,140
So universities, of course,

2092
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,380
they serve different populations.

2093
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:02,980
The real metric of a university is the value added,

2094
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:05,660
what they do to you compared to where you were heading

2095
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:06,500
otherwise.

2096
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,500
Yeah.

2097
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,380
And I think, well, last time I checked,

2098
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:10,900
Portland State was doing okay, but I mean,

2099
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:12,300
that's the metric and like I say,

2100
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:15,500
the liberal arts colleges are the worst in America

2101
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,460
for value added because they detract value.

2102
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,820
Yeah, that hurtens me because I, like you,

2103
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:20,700
I love my students.

2104
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:23,780
I thought the overwhelming majority were fantastic

2105
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:26,620
and they were eager and they were thoughtful.

2106
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:28,660
And yes, I definitely had students

2107
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:30,700
and I'm not gonna downplay this.

2108
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,220
You know, I don't know what percentage

2109
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,260
who came in wanting to hate me for sure,

2110
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:35,940
but they came in and they took the class

2111
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:37,540
and my hats off to them.

2112
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:42,460
And so my student experience was overwhelmingly positive

2113
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:44,580
and so it's heartening to hear that.

2114
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:48,340
Well, Bruce, you've been very generous with your time.

2115
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:50,580
The case for colonialism.

2116
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:53,020
I wish you seriously the best of luck,

2117
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:54,540
not only in the sale of the book

2118
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:57,220
and getting those ideas out there,

2119
01:28:57,220 --> 01:29:00,580
but I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.

2120
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:03,540
I genuinely believe that the university

2121
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:04,500
is not gonna do well,

2122
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,700
but people like you will do extraordinarily well.

2123
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:07,780
Thanks, it's been great to be here.

2124
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:08,620
Yeah, my pleasure.

2125
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:09,820
Thank you, Alex.

2126
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:11,260
Thank you for watching.

2127
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:13,300

2128
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:15,460
