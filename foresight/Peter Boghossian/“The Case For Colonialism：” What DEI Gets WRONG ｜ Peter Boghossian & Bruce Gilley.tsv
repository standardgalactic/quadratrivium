0	5000	But just imagine how pernicious a myth that is of,
6440	8440	because it often gets raised in this debate, right?
8440	10160	Well, what about the Congo?
10160	11000	Yeah.
11000	12280	You know, wasn't the Congo terrible?
12280	13120	That's what I was thinking.
13120	14480	Yeah, no, it wasn't, actually.
14480	16320	It was amazingly positive.
16320	18680	Black Lives Mattered to King Leopold,
18680	21980	and he did an amazing thing to support them.
22420	26700	Welcome to Conversations with Peter Burgosian.
26700	29620	Today we will have a conversation with Dr. Bruce Gilley.
29620	32020	He's a professor at Portland State University.
32020	33820	I hope you enjoy the conversation.
33820	34660	Thank you.
34660	37900	Dr. Bruce Gilley, it is an honor to talk to you today.
37900	40380	We're going to talk about your fantastic new book,
40380	42060	The Case for Colonialism.
42060	43380	But before we do that,
43380	45980	we have a lot of other things to talk about.
45980	49060	You are now the most hated man in Portland State University.
49700	52020	Oh, no, that's undervaluing my hatred.
52020	54220	I think I'm the most hated man
54220	56580	in the Western United States, at least.
57580	60780	So people are very upset with you,
60780	62140	and I remember you were very kind,
62140	64380	and you took a lot of time to explain,
64380	65740	so we went out to lunch,
65740	68140	and you took time to explain to my son and I
68140	71700	about colonialism, and I definitely want to talk about that.
71700	73140	But before we talk about that,
73140	74180	we have some,
74220	76060	issues of the day that we need to talk about,
76060	79300	specifically the plagiarism scandal.
79300	81500	So before I go into it,
81500	83260	do you have any brief thoughts on it,
83260	86900	the caught-in-gay and DEI plagiarism scandals?
86900	90740	Well, I think it ultimately all comes back to the same thing,
90740	93660	which is higher education,
93660	96620	maybe general intellectual life as a whole,
96620	98620	has always been political, right?
98620	101260	So you say that there's a lot of political issues
101260	102580	that are going to be raised,
102580	103740	but it's always been political, right?
103740	105180	So you say that this art's political,
105180	107700	or that writing that guy's book is political, fine.
107700	109500	It's always been political in some sense.
109500	112780	You can have standards of logic or evidence and stuff,
112780	114660	but saying that someone's political.
114660	115900	But I think what happened,
115900	119220	which people only now realize really,
119220	122380	is some of these fields, if not all of them,
122380	125980	especially the studies fields, stopped being political.
125980	127660	Political meaning a situation
127660	129620	where people can have different points of view,
129620	131660	even though they take points of view,
131700	133340	and they became totalitarian.
133340	134180	Correct.
134180	137380	Which means there is no possibility
137380	139740	of having more than one point of view.
139740	141820	Once a field becomes totalitarian,
141820	144900	i.e. once it loses the debate
144900	147780	that marks a political situation,
147780	150060	thinking itself becomes degraded,
150060	153420	because why would you try and think different thoughts?
153420	157100	Your whole job is to find a script and to follow it,
157100	158980	and the logical conclusion of that
158980	163940	is to actually start to recite it, to repeat it.
163940	165580	Like Marxist ideological training.
165580	168540	To plagiarize it, but it's not plagiarism,
168540	171420	because as a good party member,
171420	173980	you're repeating the mantras of the master.
173980	176740	You are citing the key phrases.
176740	179940	You are showing how history all can be understood
179940	181900	through this master narrative,
181900	184700	which in the case of the DEI, or the Black Studies people,
184700	186980	is the oppression of black people in structural racism.
186980	187820	We know that.
188660	191100	In some ways, people having this kind of
191100	192940	neo-victorian response,
192940	197380	oh dear, plagiarism is silly,
197380	199700	because of course she plagiarizes,
199700	202980	because plagiarism is all about a totalitarian mindset
202980	205740	of following the master and repeating the mantras
205740	207540	and adhering to the principles.
207540	208380	That's so interesting.
208380	210340	And we should have known all along
210340	215180	that these DEI diversity recruits and appointments
215180	216860	were gonna be full of plagiarism,
216860	219180	because in a communist or a totalitarian mindset,
219180	220500	that's not called plagiarism.
220500	221940	It's called towing the line.
221940	223180	That's so interesting.
223180	227180	I never thought about it from that perspective before.
228180	231540	So by the time we release this,
233060	236100	and I'm confident that I can say this now,
236100	238500	we have found many people who have plagiarized
238500	239940	at the highest levels.
239940	242020	So that doesn't surprise you.
242020	245460	Of course you have, and it's the tip of the iceberg.
245500	248540	And once we start running these papers
248540	251220	they've submitted and published through the fact checker,
251220	256220	the plagiarizer, the AI enhanced plagiarism detector,
256300	258700	we're gonna see, just as if I had taken
258700	261060	a bunch of papers from Marxist in China
261060	262700	and run them through the plagiarism checker,
262700	265380	of course I'd find all they do is plagiarize
265380	267900	their mentors, their party leaders,
267900	270420	the great leaders, the great speeches, right?
270420	272740	Because that's what totalitarianism does,
272740	274220	is it creates a script.
274220	277100	And you're expected to memorize it and repeat it.
277100	278780	It's not called plagiarism.
278780	281340	And so to say a charge of plagiarism
281340	283540	against someone like Claudine Gaye
283540	285460	is rather like charging a party member
285460	287420	in the Soviet Union of quoting Marx.
287420	289140	Of course I quoted Marx.
289140	291020	I did it as much as possible.
291020	292260	It's not plagiarism.
292260	294300	I just learned the lingo and the phrase.
294300	296140	So let me ask you a question.
296140	300300	I cannot, I sincerely cannot for the life of me figure it out.
300300	302300	Maybe you can help me figure this out.
304500	307900	Okay, so she kept her salary of $900,000 a year
307900	309380	and it's a private institution.
309380	311340	They do take federal funding though,
311340	312420	but it's a private institution.
312420	313740	Do you do anything you want as a private institution?
313740	314780	You want to double her salary?
314780	315980	That's your business.
315980	317500	It's none of my concern.
317500	319580	But and she's now faculty.
319580	322660	So she's back in her faculty.
322660	324220	She's been removed from the administration.
324220	327220	So you need to please help me understand two things.
327220	329620	And I'm very sincere when I say this.
329620	331860	Why isn't she kicked out of the university?
331860	335860	But even more so when your paper came out
335860	336780	in Third World Quarterly,
336780	338500	people, there was a petition I remember
338500	341860	that went around saying that they wanted your PhD.
341860	342700	Revoked.
342700	343540	Revoked.
343540	346900	They wanted your PhD for an article
346900	349900	that you made an argument for a position.
349900	354340	Like, and people are of course free to disagree.
354340	355580	That's what we, that's what,
355580	357180	that's the whole structure that we've said.
357180	358140	That's the coin of the realm.
358140	359900	Disagreement, publishing and that's great.
359900	361380	Fine, wonderful, fantastic.
361380	363580	But they wanted your PhD from that.
363580	367340	But this woman is a serial plagiarist.
367340	369140	We know that for a fact.
369140	372060	So please help me explain one,
372060	373940	why she is still faculty.
373940	375660	And two, why hasn't she,
375660	377980	why is her PhD not revoked?
377980	380740	Because she's part of the people.
380740	383380	The people, the communists used to call those
383380	385140	who told the party line
385140	387100	and were good members of society or the party,
387100	389620	the people, i.e. they're on the inside.
389620	394620	And even though reactionary forces may take them down,
394780	396020	they're still part of the people.
396020	397620	So of course they're their kid.
397620	400180	I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if they promote her
400180	401500	in the Department of African Studies
401500	404620	because she's done exactly what she should do.
404620	408540	She's used her color to seize power.
408540	410060	She's then used her power
410060	413540	to promote the totalitarian ideology of DEI.
413540	417460	And then when she's been found to have copied
417460	422460	and repeated and propagated the ideology of the masters
422500	424560	and ousted by reactionary forces,
424560	427860	she has gone down saying, I'm a victim of racism.
429260	431760	So not only is she back in place,
431760	433420	she should be given a raise.
433420	435380	She should be promoted.
435380	437980	She is the most loyal party cadre
437980	440820	to the cause of DEI and wokeness
440820	442540	that Harvard has ever seen.
442540	445420	So, you know, this surprise to me
445420	447420	is they haven't yet announced a salary raise
447420	450540	or an endowed chair for her in African Studies
450540	454300	because she is the model of the good party hack.
454300	456060	Now, I'm exactly the opposite, right?
456060	457420	I'm the white Russian.
457420	458260	I'm the white Russian.
458260	459540	I am the reactionary.
459540	460860	I'm outside of the people.
460860	464940	So when I do something that causes controversy,
464940	467620	which isn't actually plagiarism or calling for genocide,
467620	469100	but it's just part of an article,
469100	473780	of course the reaction to me is, well, that's the gulag for him.
473780	476860	You know, revoke his PhD, cancel his article.
476860	478700	If he shows up at any conferences,
478700	481060	this was Hamad Dabishi at Columbia University,
481060	482100	we should attack him.
482100	483220	We should mob him.
483220	484300	We should silence him.
484300	485820	We should snub him.
485820	486660	Because that's all they have.
486660	490100	Then we get my faculty union at Portland State saying,
490100	491820	I should be stripped of academic freedom
491820	493820	and stripped of my faculty position
493820	496700	because my research is outside
496700	500100	of the totalitarian ideology of anti-colonialism, right?
500100	504320	So yeah, I mean, part of me is like, what do you expect, right?
504320	507260	And people like you have been studying
507260	511040	the totalitarian mindset of DEI and Wokeness for so long.
511040	513400	We shouldn't be surprised when its response
513400	516680	to a liberal critique is racists, reactionaries.
516680	518640	No, that's not what surprises me.
518640	520840	But what surprises me is that,
520840	524600	isn't there a universal rule set?
524600	526960	I mean, there was up until very, very recently,
526960	528920	maybe, I can't give you an exact date,
528920	531080	but maybe 2010, I'm guessing,
531080	535040	that if somebody plagiarized a dissertation,
535040	537640	and I think it would probably suit me well
537640	540360	to have names of people who they've caught in the past
540360	544920	who have plagiarized and then they lost their PhDs,
544920	548200	is it that if you adhere to one particular orthodoxy,
548200	549840	I mean, okay, so, Braggman,
551680	553560	isn't there just some kind of a rule
553560	558080	that if you plagiarize, there's no rule to that?
558080	561000	I mean, come on, look at how many,
561000	563920	what we thought were foundations of higher education
563920	566760	collapsed in the last five years.
566760	569800	You know, the idea of a student code of conduct
569800	573400	at Princeton, which included don't plagiarize,
573400	577560	was attacked and taken down by the Black Student Union
577560	579560	because they said plagiarism's okay.
579560	581560	This was long before Claudine Gay.
581560	584880	The leading lights of African-American society
584880	587240	who have been carefully selected and curated
587240	590480	to go to Princeton were rallying on campus
590480	594320	to say, cheating, plagiarizing, faking your grades,
594320	597080	stealing papers, buying papers is okay,
597080	599080	because otherwise we're just replicating
599080	601320	the prison to pipeline, you know,
601320	604280	the campus school to prison pipeline.
604280	606440	So we knew those foundations were crumbling.
607400	610360	Mandatory SAT scores to enter, gone.
611860	615400	Mandatory requirements to pass or reach a certain standard
615400	617720	to get a high school degree, gone, right?
617720	620800	So plagiarism, not okay, gone, right?
620800	624600	So by the time Claudine Gay gets into this controversy,
624600	626520	we have these two worlds, right?
626520	629860	We have the old liberal world of academic standards
629860	632280	that you and I live in, but we don't realize
632280	635160	how far the other side has drifted away from this.
635160	637240	And it's not that we didn't plagiarize,
637240	639720	it's of course we plagiarized and you pointing it out
639720	641280	and saying there's something wrong with it is racist.
641280	643360	That's exactly what the critique is,
643360	646200	that there's something wrong with us for,
646200	648880	so I think that that will go down
648880	650360	among a certain group of people,
650360	654760	like Mark Lamont Hill and his supporters and-
654760	655600	Kendi.
655600	656880	And Kendi.
656880	659360	So just to be crystal clear about something
659360	660720	that this is not about race,
660720	665240	I'm telling you right with total sincerity,
665240	667920	I'm running your dissertation through a plagiarism checker,
667920	670080	and if you're found guilty of plagiarism,
670080	672760	I'm gonna suggest that you lose your PhD revoked.
672760	673100	Please do.
673220	676140	And I would demand on our friendship
676140	677380	that you would do the same to me.
677380	677860	Absolutely.
677860	681420	If my PhD dissertation, I can't remember what the name is,
681420	682420	it's a critical-
682420	683460	I can't remember the name of it.
683460	684580	I can't remember what the name is,
684580	687460	it's something like, it's been so long ago.
687460	689260	But if that were found to have plagiarism,
689260	691420	I would expect on the basis of our friendship
691420	693180	that you would call for the revoking of my PhD.
693180	694020	Absolutely.
694020	695700	So that is a kind of integrity that is-
695700	697780	Or anything you've published academically for that matter.
697780	698540	Right, right.
698540	699060	Us for me.
699060	701060	No, no, for sure, for sure.
701060	703140	Yeah, okay, so I'll broaden, yeah.
703140	707980	So, that goes beyond the range of...
707980	710140	That's just an integrity issue, right?
710140	712140	So it doesn't have to do with our friendship.
712140	714980	The fact that I'm your friend, that we're friends,
714980	716780	should have absolutely nothing to do
716780	719220	with the fact that you would be...
719220	721820	That makes the plagiarism okay with you.
721820	724220	The fact that we're white or male or sister,
724220	725980	whatever we want to say, whatever phrase we want,
725980	729020	it's totally independent from the fact that we violated
729020	732260	the closest thing that there is to a sin in academia
732260	733100	is plagiarism.
733100	734780	Like that's the gold standard for bad.
734780	738420	So it's independent of any attribute that we possess
738420	739500	or of any relationship.
739500	741020	Like this is deeper than that.
741020	742420	Well, yes and no.
742420	745500	I mean, of course, that's the way we would like
745500	748940	American society to operate on the basis of equality
748940	752100	and colorblind race neutrality and merit,
752100	753540	but it doesn't, right?
753540	755500	And the reason Claudine Gaye was hired
755500	757060	was because she's a black woman.
757060	758180	That's the only reason.
758180	759860	I mean, not even close, right?
759860	762300	It wasn't even like a tiebreaker consideration.
762300	764860	With someone I say, okay, we have two excellent candidates.
764860	767060	They both have amazing administrative,
767060	768500	fundraising experience.
768500	770980	They're incredibly well-renowned scholars,
770980	772940	10 university-pressed books each.
772940	774100	How are you gonna say that?
774100	777180	Okay, and we haven't had a black woman
777180	780420	and there's some discussion, it might be useful.
780420	781260	Let's do it.
781260	783580	Okay, a lot of us, even liberals would say,
783580	786780	okay, in that situation where the candidates are close
786780	788500	and it's just a tiebreaker.
788500	789700	Yeah, fine.
789700	791260	Not even close, right?
791260	794540	She was hired only because she is a black woman, right?
794540	796260	Her scholarship was so tawdry.
796260	797100	I know, I read it.
797100	798340	She wouldn't even get hired at Portland State.
798340	799180	No, she wouldn't.
799180	800020	Oh, that's a con.
800020	801140	Oh, that's a low bloke.
801140	802460	That's a low bloke.
802460	805140	No, but I mean, no, no, because actually
805140	807420	to get a 10-year job in a state university
807420	810780	takes actually a decent amount of good scholarship these days,
810780	811700	given the mismatch.
811700	813100	She had 11 publications.
813100	815140	I've read as many of those as I can access.
815140	816860	I've read them in their entirety.
816860	820940	I just read someone who analyzed her dissertation
820940	823540	and it's exactly as one would expect,
823540	827300	barring the plagiarism, sloppy invalid inferences,
827300	829540	fallacious reasoning throughout.
829540	831100	Word salad everywhere.
831100	832180	Just nothing but word salad.
832180	833340	Yeah, and she was lauded.
833340	835140	She won all these prizes.
835140	838580	The society has drifted so, we've lost our minds.
838580	841060	We've drifted so far from merit.
841060	845700	Now the institutions, the engines of knowledge
845700	848820	production of the society are fundamentally compromised.
848820	850500	Well, you could be pessimistic and say
850500	852380	that the Harvard case or any of these cases
852380	855460	shows that the academy is beyond saving.
855460	856420	And that may be true.
856420	859420	But don't forget, the great thing about free society
859420	860980	or the saving grace of a free society
860980	863300	is it can always reorganize elsewhere, right?
863300	867340	It can always escape a toxic situation or organization
867340	869020	and regroup in other ways.
869060	871740	It's what happens to cities when they get bombed out
871740	874380	like Portland did during the George Floyd summer of love.
874380	876940	And suddenly all the growth and all the wealth
876940	881620	and all the dynamism is now living outside of Portland, right?
881620	883820	Maybe in the periphery, but outside of Portland.
883820	884780	So that's OK.
884780	887180	We've seen a little bit of that in the university space,
887180	889100	not just with the new universities, which I don't think
889100	892460	really have it, but universities that are maybe second tier
892460	894460	that are attracting a lot better students,
894460	896980	getting away from the woke universities.
897020	899820	We see this also in research, right?
899820	902700	Because, yeah, academic research in many fields
902700	905860	like public policy may be a complete joke at this point
905860	906900	from within the university.
906900	908980	But that's why we have think tanks, right?
908980	911660	We have think tanks who are now basically picking up
911660	914380	the slack saying the things that need to be said.
914380	918140	So I mean, and mainstream media, another example, right?
918140	921460	Basically being hollowed out and now massive amounts
921460	924340	of media reformulating, reorganizing itself
924340	926500	on the outside of the mainstream
926500	930340	since the mainstream has gone through a process of involution.
930340	933580	OK, so let's just accept by fiat the argument
933580	934980	that I'm going to give you is correct.
934980	936660	And here's the argument.
936660	938980	And I've actually made this prediction
938980	943180	for the first 30 days, what we're going to see in.
943180	944860	And I made this a travest.
944860	948020	I think that this ideology, critical social justice,
948020	950780	will be pushed into ill repute probably in five months.
950780	953260	We already see it an expedited version.
953260	954860	We see this happening now.
955820	958420	But just accept that this is all going to happen.
958420	962020	We are going to find that the rot, the plagiarism,
962020	965900	is rampant among not only DEI bureaucrats.
965900	969020	I think that there's a hierarchy of where you'll find it.
969020	973740	But in the hard sciences, the STEM sciences,
973740	974540	there'll be less so.
974540	976140	Maybe there'll be methodological problems.
976140	979540	But that's so labor intensive to find.
979540	981140	We're not even going to talk about that.
981140	983780	But in DEI and soft fields, you're
983780	986180	going to find rampant plagiarism.
986180	989420	OK, the universities are going to be pushed into ill repute.
989420	990300	Or not ill repute.
990300	992500	The ideology will be pushed into ill repute.
992500	995420	The universities will further lose their legitimacy.
995420	999060	And hopefully, the numbers of enrollment will plummet.
999060	1004660	So my question to you is, accepting that that's the case,
1004660	1008460	what do you see as the outcome of that?
1008460	1010060	Are there like University of Austin?
1010060	1012460	Are there these new universities coming up?
1013020	1015060	Or do the people just, you think there's
1015060	1017900	going to be another sea shift, where you say, well,
1017900	1019460	don't hire people from universities
1019460	1021940	or go to Khan Academy and get a certificate?
1021940	1024220	What do you see is going to happen?
1024220	1028060	Remember, there's always a demand side for skills
1028060	1028860	in the economy.
1028860	1033940	And first of all, as you said, in sciences, those fields,
1033940	1036060	despite the attempts of DEI and Wokeness,
1036060	1037460	but they can't afford that.
1037460	1039460	Because science and technology fields
1039460	1042180	are changing so rapidly with computing
1042220	1045220	and computer-assisted biology, physics, chemistry,
1045220	1046420	engineering.
1046420	1049820	These fields, they don't have time for this BS,
1049820	1052780	even though we see it in medical schools a little bit.
1052780	1055020	But not really, because even the medical field
1055020	1056260	doesn't have time for this.
1056260	1060940	Professional schools, engineering, dentistry,
1060940	1063100	architecture, I mean, they planning.
1063100	1065540	They need to get stuff taught.
1065540	1066620	But we see it now, too.
1066620	1067820	We see it in medicine.
1067820	1070980	We do, but it's not at the core.
1071420	1074300	It's not at the same degree as in the humanities.
1074300	1075140	That's for sure.
1075140	1075980	Right, right.
1075980	1079500	And my guess is it will remain outside of the core
1079500	1082300	of these fields because there's a simple supply
1082300	1084500	and demand equation, which is employers
1084500	1086620	who are expected to carry out highly risky
1086620	1089060	and technically demanding skills
1089060	1092580	require employees who can show they've graduated
1092580	1094700	from programs and they will simply not hire you
1094700	1096380	if you're not graduating from a program
1096380	1097220	that's delivering the skills.
1097220	1099580	And they'll know within days whether you were taught or not.
1099580	1102300	So I think those areas are pretty safe.
1102300	1104380	Humanities and social sciences is a total different area
1104380	1107500	because ultimately the reason those degrees used
1107500	1110220	to generate value added for the graduates
1110220	1111540	was you could think.
1111540	1116260	Yeah, well, you could think you were articulate
1116260	1117380	in dealing with others.
1117380	1118940	You could work in groups.
1118940	1121300	You could think about social situations.
1121300	1123620	You could execute projects.
1123620	1127620	You had some degree of ability to communicate effectively.
1127620	1129060	And you were able to shift.
1129060	1131700	You were able to change roles
1131700	1133300	because you weren't so specialized.
1133300	1135980	You were a generalist by training.
1135980	1138420	That's what they taught you is to be a generalist by training
1138420	1140940	and that's often very useful in an organization.
1140940	1144340	But what happens when those students are found
1144340	1147340	to be less good in those generalist roles
1148260	1150180	than students who went to community college
1150180	1151300	or technical college?
1151300	1155140	Well, then you see the decline in the enrollment
1155140	1157820	because the decline in the job offers.
1157860	1162700	So then you get a migration into fields
1162700	1165140	that seem to be still rigorous, right?
1165140	1168860	I mean, one of the reasons why we see people migrating
1168860	1170860	into colleges like Catholic colleges
1170860	1174100	or liberal arts colleges that are more conservative
1174100	1176500	is because people are looking for where is that
1176500	1178860	still rigorous liberal arts education.
1178860	1180540	But I think the bigger picture is, yeah,
1180540	1183500	that social science humanities space
1183500	1186540	that used to generate a lot of value added
1186540	1188420	is just not gonna generate the value added
1188420	1191460	and employers are gonna know it, so it's gonna shrink.
1191460	1195460	So if everything I've said is correct,
1195460	1198140	you predict enrollments will further plummet.
1198140	1200740	I wanna add on one thing that you said,
1200740	1202900	maybe it's a pushback, maybe it's an add.
1202900	1206140	It's not just that people aren't qualified.
1206140	1208300	It's almost as if they're anti-qualified
1208300	1210900	when they get degrees because they're coming in
1210900	1212220	with the wrong skill sets.
1212220	1214740	They're coming in not with thinking about things
1214740	1216660	in terms of merit or efficiency or what have you,
1216660	1219420	but in terms of developing a lens,
1219420	1222300	a critical consciousness, a lens to identify racism.
1222300	1223380	They're not thinking about it
1223380	1225220	in terms of maximizing shareholder wealth.
1225220	1228180	Like they have a different set of organizing principles
1228180	1230260	that they come into the, so it could actually be
1230260	1232580	an even worse thing that you hire them
1232580	1235020	or as if you just hired a kind of random person
1235020	1236140	who wasn't a doctorate.
1236140	1238300	Like, because it's always worse to do a worse thing
1238300	1240460	by definition that is to do something neutral.
1240460	1243420	Yeah, but keep in mind the totality
1243420	1246540	of the intellectual and social maturation
1246540	1251540	that happens for a 18 year old in the four years
1251780	1254420	between leaving high school and four years in college
1254420	1255420	and getting out.
1255420	1259620	Now, yes, what their woke professor forces them to read
1259620	1262100	and write in the classroom is part of that.
1262100	1263820	But if I was to put a percentage wise
1263820	1268740	on that kind of inculcation of wokeness into the student
1268780	1271180	as the totality in terms of the contribution
1271180	1273140	to the intellectual social development,
1273140	1274180	I'd say 20%.
1274180	1275380	Really? Yeah.
1275380	1277620	You don't think someone caught in the orbit of that idea?
1277620	1280820	No, because I think 80% of what happens,
1280820	1283940	80% of what actually generates value for college
1283940	1288620	is simply being surrounded by smart, interesting,
1288620	1292620	curious young people like yourself for four years
1292620	1297100	with a certain subject as the kind of excuse to be there.
1297100	1299100	But much of what happens in college,
1299100	1300380	as we all know who've been there,
1300380	1302820	is the conversations, the friendships,
1302820	1305980	the extracurriculars, even the decoding
1305980	1307740	of your stupid professor, right?
1307740	1311420	I.e. the kind of mimicking what the professor wants,
1311420	1313740	but knowing all along that this is nonsense
1313740	1315180	or there's something wrong with that.
1315180	1316380	That's actually also part
1316380	1318100	of the intellectual maturation process.
1318100	1321580	So, professors, and I sometimes think critics
1321580	1324980	of higher education over exaggerate
1324980	1327020	the role of the curriculum
1327020	1331660	and the courses in what the students are doing on campus
1331660	1334060	and what exactly is contributing
1334060	1336260	to their intellectual and social maturation.
1336260	1339220	So, students go through these programs
1339220	1342180	and they come out actually amazingly normal.
1342180	1344380	You know, if they studied women and black studies
1344380	1345540	or something, right?
1345540	1347620	But they still need to organize the bake sale.
1347620	1348460	They still need to figure
1348460	1350940	out their dorm room roommates for the next year.
1350940	1353680	They still needed to get their flights back and forth.
1353680	1356020	They still needed to get the debate team
1356020	1357180	to the debate competition.
1357180	1358660	They still needed to get their gym pass
1358660	1360300	and go to the pool three times a week.
1360300	1363580	I mean, all this stuff that's taking place on the periphery
1363580	1366380	is actually part of the maturation process.
1366380	1367220	I see that.
1367220	1369060	I guess I don't agree.
1369060	1373140	I mean, I don't agree because what you said
1373140	1377940	would only be true if there were intellectual diversity
1377940	1379920	among the peer group.
1379920	1383060	But if there's a culture, if there's a cultural soup
1383100	1385980	in which certain conclusions are forwarded
1385980	1388500	and certain people aren't allowed to challenge that,
1388500	1390300	it seems like being in that environment
1390300	1392420	would not only be epistemologically
1392420	1394940	and cognitively damaging to one's social
1394940	1396820	and even emotional development,
1396820	1400640	but over time it would be sclerotic
1400640	1403140	in terms of muscles would atrophy
1403140	1405020	that need to work through these problems.
1405020	1406380	Now, yeah, you do have logistics.
1406380	1408940	You'd have to like figure out how to get to the pool
1408940	1410900	or you know, how to get a gym pass.
1411740	1416260	But you would need to do that if you weren't in college.
1416260	1419500	Yeah, but remember what's important about college
1419500	1420700	is it's the peer group, right?
1420700	1422500	Is that it's like a bunch of kids
1422500	1424660	who wanna get further education.
1424660	1427660	So the inclination or the orientation of these kids
1427660	1429660	is academically, to some extent.
1429660	1431260	I mean, less than the lower school.
1431260	1433140	Once you're in a good state school,
1433140	1435660	everyone's there to learn and to be something and to plan.
1435660	1436500	That's one thing.
1436500	1438220	The second thing is there's a huge difference.
1438220	1439060	And I would agree with you
1439060	1440860	that when we talk about small liberal arts
1440860	1442860	colleges, what you say that's sclerosis
1442860	1444460	and the inbreeding, absolutely.
1444460	1446680	So that's why Reed College,
1446680	1449580	which is close to where I live in Portland, Oregon,
1449580	1452540	is the second highest ranked liberal arts college
1452540	1453460	in the country.
1453460	1457300	It is also the worst ranked college in the state of Oregon.
1457300	1460220	One of the worst, bottom 10 worst in the entire country
1460220	1462740	for taking value away from students
1462740	1465420	based on what we would expect their income to be
1465420	1467340	based on their incoming SAT scores.
1467340	1468940	So that's how we basically add,
1468940	1471380	like calculate what a college does to a person
1471380	1474540	is look at their incoming SAT scores and class ranking
1474540	1476740	and then say, okay, that person like that
1476740	1478260	typically would end up earning this.
1478260	1480060	People who go to Reed or any of these
1480060	1483060	really woke liberal arts colleges way underperform.
1483060	1485300	Now that's exactly evidence of what you're talking about,
1485300	1487460	that that is so inbred and sclerotic
1487460	1489260	and there's no diversity of thinking.
1489260	1491820	But if you're at a big research university, right,
1491820	1495980	don't forget that that faculty of arts and science, right,
1495980	1498840	might be a very small part of the entire university.
1498840	1500680	In fact, I did an article a couple of months ago
1500680	1505400	on looking at all degrees awarded in the United States.
1505400	1510160	And I found that only about 30% were in fields
1510160	1512320	that could remotely be considered woke.
1512320	1515760	So consider a university that's basically a 70-30 split,
1515760	1516600	right?
1516600	1518920	Now, yes, if you really don't ever leave
1518920	1521120	your little college classroom
1521120	1523080	and just hang out with those 30%,
1523080	1524920	yeah, there'll be some sclerosis there.
1524920	1527640	But you're in a sea of engineers,
1527640	1530520	commerce students, dentists students, biology majors,
1530520	1533760	biomedical engineering, AI, computer science,
1533760	1535680	parks and recreation, right?
1535680	1538240	I mean, and these are actually the fields
1538240	1540160	that you're making friendships with.
1540160	1542560	And so there's just such a dilution
1542560	1546920	of that woke curriculum in a major research university.
1546920	1550520	So I think the harm is much reduced
1550520	1551840	compared to in a liberal arts college.
1551960	1557960	Yeah, that's interesting and somewhat hopeful.
1557960	1560200	I want to do one more thing before I talk about the case
1560200	1561840	for colonialism.
1561840	1566280	Do you have any predictions about specifically
1566280	1567960	the academic landscape, about what
1567960	1571840	we're going to see in six months or a year?
1571840	1576040	So one thing that typically happens in a case like this,
1576080	1582160	the cycle is we're going to see this focus on competency
1582160	1583520	for university presidents.
1583520	1585040	It's going to be all about competency.
1585040	1588200	The diversity hires are going to be out the window.
1588200	1590160	We're going to see a move to competency.
1590160	1592560	We're going to see a move to the managers.
1592560	1595200	I mean, it's almost like the revolutionary cycle.
1595200	1601320	It's like the worst period of the revolution
1601320	1606000	is now coming to an end, the sort of bloodletting
1606000	1609280	and the crazy extremists who got in positions of power
1609280	1613240	have finally proven to be unable to manage the organization.
1613240	1615800	You get this is called Thermador.
1615800	1617680	In the revolutionary calendar in France,
1617680	1618640	this was called Thermador.
1618640	1621760	This is when the managers came into power,
1621760	1626200	settled things down, de-democratized a little bit.
1626200	1628720	So the DEI and the Black Studies Association
1628720	1632040	doesn't get a veto on the university president choice.
1632080	1635400	Competency, proven track record,
1635400	1638120	become the currency of the realm.
1638120	1639640	I think that's pretty clear.
1639640	1642320	That's pretty easy prediction.
1642320	1644280	The more difficult prediction is.
1644280	1647520	And therefore, do we see some serious efforts
1647520	1651200	at re-establishing the integrity of the university?
1651200	1653600	I mean, you had seen some of that coming in,
1653600	1657120	in terms of faculty-led freedom of thought
1657120	1660240	and academic freedom groups springing up
1660240	1665680	on the margins, but if the group at Harvard is an example,
1665680	1668600	that's a very weak straw to expect reform from.
1668600	1671280	Steven Pinker's group, which was set up
1671280	1674480	with some foundation funding to promote academic freedom
1674480	1676760	at Harvard, and they said, well, we're
1676760	1679240	going to have some seminars and have some teachings
1679240	1682280	and talk about higher education reform and stuff.
1682280	1686840	Well, it was nowhere to be seen during this entire debacle,
1686840	1688240	nowhere to be seen.
1688240	1691120	I predict within the next few months,
1691120	1693880	we're going to see massive incidents of plagiarism.
1693880	1696200	And there's a hierarchy, as I said, with DEI,
1696200	1697400	the squishy stuff.
1697400	1699040	I think you're going to see it in psychology.
1699040	1702080	I think you're going to see it across the board.
1702080	1703920	Here's my fear, and for anybody listening,
1703920	1710640	I really hope that this is the case.
1710640	1713520	Don't just go, I want people to research,
1713520	1714400	do their own research.
1714400	1715560	I want people to dig in.
1715560	1716800	I want people to be sleuths.
1716800	1719200	I want people to find things.
1719200	1721280	But you can't just put it out there
1721280	1723640	unless you are absolutely positive.
1723640	1726600	Because every instance of something
1726600	1729760	that you put out that you're not positive of,
1729760	1731360	it's going to come back to bite you,
1731360	1732600	and then people are going to say, this is all right.
1732600	1733960	It's going to cloud the issue, yeah.
1733960	1736960	And then you're going to have other people who
1736960	1739000	want the DEI bureaucrats in place, who
1739000	1740920	are going to pretend they found plagiarism, who
1740920	1742320	haven't found plagiarism.
1742320	1744160	I'm sure someone's already thought of that.
1744160	1749960	So I am both optimistic, and I'm not optimistic.
1749960	1751960	But I think we're seeing the tip of the iceberg.
1751960	1753800	And again, what's to be super interesting to me
1753800	1758480	is to figure out what percentage of my former colleagues
1758480	1760840	or percentage of people across various disciplines
1760840	1761520	have plagiarized.
1761520	1763240	Because it's only a matter of time.
1763240	1765520	And again, I'm not talking sloppy methodologies
1765520	1767160	or what have you, which Gay also had.
1767160	1770480	I'm talking actual textbook plagiarism.
1770480	1773680	I don't know the answer to that, but within the next few months,
1773680	1774720	we are going to find out.
1774720	1778680	Certainly within six months, we're going to find out.
1778680	1782120	Keep in mind, we're operating in a world
1782120	1786160	where plagiarism is a rather old-fashioned concept anyways.
1786160	1790840	Most young people grew up in a cut-and-paste world.
1790840	1792240	That's how they did their research.
1792240	1793720	So you know what I'm going to do?
1793720	1796240	I'm going to take this book, The Case for Colonialism.
1796240	1797720	I'm going to do exactly the same thing,
1797720	1799880	but I'm going to put Peter Bogosian right there.
1799880	1800960	I'm going to do the same thing.
1800960	1802800	I'm going to write that it's going to be the same book.
1802920	1804120	It's going to be the same title.
1804120	1806400	How do you feel about that?
1806400	1808880	It wouldn't surprise me in the least.
1808880	1810280	No, but I mean, I'm serious.
1810280	1814480	We know from our own students that they don't recognize
1814480	1817200	they're doing something wrong when they cut-and-paste
1817200	1821080	a Wikipedia article and lightly edit it to say what they
1821080	1821880	wanted to say.
1821880	1824080	And now we have chat GBT going on as well.
1824080	1828240	So this is not an issue that is as cut-and-dried.
1828240	1831800	It may be cut-and-dried to us from a standards perspective,
1831800	1834480	but in the culture, this is not a cut-and-dried issue.
1834480	1837200	Now, how easy is it for the DEI types
1837200	1840680	to then segue or more likely to slipstream
1840680	1843280	off that cultural assumption that we're all
1843280	1846800	in this kind of mixtape kind of culture
1846800	1849320	and say, well, you're just calling out this mixtaper
1849320	1850760	because they're black, right?
1850760	1852800	And suddenly the issue is clouded over.
1852800	1853800	It's partisan.
1853800	1855400	The president of Stanford was white,
1855400	1859720	and he just resigned for falsification of data.
1859720	1861760	Yeah, well, but that's the thing.
1861760	1864440	When you come in with an idea, when you're a hammer,
1864440	1865800	everything looks like a nail.
1865800	1868440	So they just write those things off as anomalous.
1868440	1873320	Yeah, I just don't think it's as straight a pathway
1873320	1877480	as you think to say you have this long paragraph, which
1877480	1880080	is verbatim from this book.
1880080	1881140	There's no footnote.
1881140	1882920	There's no mention of a citation.
1882920	1884000	This is wrong.
1884000	1886680	And you think this is a cut-and-dried case, right?
1886680	1888320	Well, it's true.
1888320	1890040	She should have been more careful.
1890040	1891040	Duplicit of language.
1891040	1896200	Yeah, or she was learning and using and was sloppy, right?
1896200	1901920	But this idea that this is simply a slam-dunk case
1901920	1907080	for the person to be whatever is, I think,
1907080	1909000	a treasure chestnut of you and me.
1909000	1910960	But I don't think that that's going to play out,
1910960	1912440	especially when all you need to do
1912440	1914640	is throw out some cloudy issues like race.
1914640	1917000	Or, well, all these people said this was plagiarism,
1917000	1917800	and it was sloppy.
1917800	1919640	It turned out not to be.
1919640	1922800	So we need to find an instance of somebody
1922800	1925960	who is not black who lost their PhD.
1925960	1929200	There must be somebody who lost their PhD for plagiarism.
1929200	1931320	I'm sure there's lots, lots, lots.
1931320	1932760	And so we need to.
1932760	1935120	So the next thing in this is everybody.
1935120	1937280	Well, I would just look up retraction watch, right?
1937280	1938200	Which is retraction.
1938200	1939560	Retraction watch has always done this.
1939560	1941600	Oh, yeah, they retracted the hoax articles.
1941600	1944240	Yeah, and anything retracted for any reason.
1944240	1946000	And a lot of those are plagiarism cases.
1946000	1948680	And maybe you can sort and you can see all the retractions
1948680	1949240	for plagiarism.
1949400	1952840	So we need to figure out an institutional way
1952840	1954720	to have these people's PhDs broke.
1954720	1957360	And I don't care if you're in any field, philosophy,
1957360	1958640	political science.
1958640	1959840	I don't care if you're a midget.
1959840	1961440	I don't care what your weight is.
1961440	1961840	Your height.
1961840	1963040	I need to totally irrelevant.
1963040	1963840	Your race.
1963840	1964800	Absolutely irrelevant.
1964800	1967720	If you plagiarized, you should lose your decision,
1967720	1969040	including me and including you.
1969040	1969920	Of course.
1969920	1970680	Of course.
1970680	1972960	But let's watch that play out.
1972960	1976480	And ultimately, it'll always surprise us how it does.
1976480	1978360	It's funny, though, also because I
1978400	1979520	advocate these positions.
1979520	1980920	I'm suddenly a conservative.
1980920	1982160	That's what fascinates me.
1983400	1987800	Yeah, although remember, you know, sometimes it's the room
1987800	1988680	outside the room.
1988680	1993320	And I think if you spend a lot of time inside the room,
1993320	1998400	you're not aware that actually outside of the room,
1998400	1999840	the dynamics are very different.
1999840	2003080	So, you know, of course, you're a conservative within the
2003080	2005760	higher academic or cultural wars perspective,
2005760	2008120	because all the people you're arguing against
2008120	2010560	are far left lunatics, right?
2010560	2014440	But in normal society, people would probably see you as too
2014440	2016440	much of a kind of waffly liberal.
2016440	2017280	Yeah, liberal liberal.
2017280	2019720	Yeah, and in American political discourse,
2019720	2023040	you'd be kind of like suspicious center or center leftist.
2023040	2027320	So actually, you know, it's like where you
2027320	2029360	calibrating yourself, you know?
2029360	2031800	And if you're in the lunatic asylum,
2031800	2034160	you're going to be the sanest person there.
2034160	2037160	Doesn't mean you don't have some mental issues in society.
2037160	2037920	Right, right.
2037960	2039720	So, OK, so let's go back.
2039720	2044600	So I required the case for colonialism for all my students.
2044600	2046560	Talk a little bit, if you don't mind, about that.
2046560	2049560	That was a crazy controversy.
2049560	2053920	So people lost their minds at you.
2053920	2054480	Tell us about it.
2054480	2057560	I know you've talked about it before, but just tell us about it.
2057560	2062080	So as 2017, this article came out, so it's six years now.
2062080	2065720	The article was basically a backgrounder for myself,
2065720	2068720	because I was about to write the biography of a British colonial
2068720	2072560	official, and he had written and said a lot about the case
2072560	2074880	for colonialism, but he wasn't a scholar.
2074880	2075560	He was an official.
2075560	2078120	He was giving speeches, and it was kind of all over the place.
2078120	2080400	I was like, let's bring some order to this argument.
2080400	2082000	Like, what exactly is the argument?
2082000	2084200	How does it run logically?
2084200	2089320	And so I essentially put this argument together
2089320	2092080	to be useful for myself before I wrote the book.
2092080	2095000	So when I came to kind of some ways repeating
2095160	2096760	and making sense of what he had said,
2096760	2097920	I could organize a little better.
2097920	2099200	So who's the reason?
2099200	2102000	Sir Allen Burns was a British colonial official.
2102000	2104120	The book was called The Last Imperialist.
2104120	2107440	Ended up coming out in 2019.
2107440	2108880	And it was very successful.
2108880	2111840	But this was a backgrounder to that, essentially, for myself.
2111840	2115280	But I thought, hey, this is useful,
2115280	2117760	because there's not this article out there.
2117760	2120240	We always have the case for this, the case for that,
2120240	2122760	in defense of this, or against this, whatever.
2122760	2124760	That's part of the academic discourse.
2124760	2126800	And I had published an article two years earlier
2126800	2131040	on Chinua Kebe, the African novelist,
2131040	2133240	saying that this guy who is supposedly
2133240	2135760	this pantheonic figure in anti-colonialism
2135760	2137520	actually wasn't anti-colonial at all.
2137520	2140040	Or at least he had mixed views,
2140040	2141600	would be a charitable reading.
2141600	2142640	Okay, let me pause you.
2142640	2144400	Explain colonialism.
2144400	2147240	What is that in two sentences?
2147240	2148960	Colonialism, in one sentence,
2148960	2153360	is when country A extends its governance system
2153400	2155080	over territory B,
2155080	2158440	which does not have a sovereign governing system at the time.
2158440	2160400	Okay, all right, so that situates it.
2160400	2165400	So you wrote The Case for Colonialism in 2017,
2165880	2168200	and you published it in Third World Quarterly,
2168200	2172040	which, high impact factor journal, correct me if I'm wrong.
2172040	2172880	Yeah.
2172880	2174840	Right, so it's very reputable.
2174840	2176880	It wasn't, you know, back of a magazine,
2176880	2179720	it was a very highly reputable academic journal.
2179720	2181040	And what happened?
2181040	2182880	Well, it got two reviews.
2182880	2184720	One was positive, one was negative.
2184720	2186320	So typically in a case like that,
2186320	2188080	it goes to the editor,
2188080	2190400	and the editor can make a decision,
2190400	2191640	accept or reject.
2192680	2194720	And funnily enough,
2194720	2195920	I had the same experience
2195920	2198440	with the first journal I submitted it to,
2198440	2200800	the Journal of Intervention and State Building.
2200800	2203140	Got one except one reject.
2203140	2205200	And the managing editor,
2205200	2208840	rather than making his call based on academic criteria
2208840	2209880	or his judgment,
2209880	2211520	went to the board and said,
2211560	2212880	I'd really like to publish this,
2212880	2214800	but I'm kind of afraid of the backlash.
2214800	2216840	And the board said, you're right,
2216840	2218660	too politically risky,
2218660	2220920	give it a reject because of the political backlash.
2220920	2222080	Right, so not that it was false,
2222080	2224280	sort of a sloppy, sloppy organization.
2224280	2226680	Afraid to publish it, afraid to publish it.
2226680	2230480	And I've named him in the book, you know, it's all public.
2230480	2233200	So Third World Quarterly was the same except reject,
2233200	2235440	but this time the editor did what an editor
2235440	2236280	is supposed to do,
2236280	2238880	just exercise his or her judgment
2238880	2241000	in terms of the academic merit.
2241000	2242840	Merit, merit.
2242840	2244840	Merit, whether the article would contribute
2244840	2246800	to the journal, spark a debate.
2246800	2248360	And he said, yes, this is great.
2248360	2249640	Let's run it.
2249640	2252520	He said, let's run it as a commentary article
2252520	2254920	rather than as original research article.
2254920	2256920	So it's a peer-reviewed commentary article
2256920	2258920	rather than a peer-reviewed research article.
2258920	2260800	But, you know, like most journals,
2260800	2263400	they have a variety of types of peer-reviewed articles
2263400	2264720	that they accept, you know,
2264720	2266920	short research contributions, research articles,
2266920	2268820	commentaries, whatever I said, fine.
2268820	2270620	Publish it as a commentary article.
2271700	2276340	Within minutes of its appearance online
2276340	2279560	before its formal publication in the journal,
2279560	2281740	there was an outrage storm on Facebook,
2281740	2283420	started on Facebook, right?
2283420	2285900	Because a friend of mine in Australia said,
2285900	2287900	oh, you're like not my Facebook page, mate.
2287900	2290580	Well done, you know, in email to me.
2290580	2291420	That's good, dude.
2291420	2295260	Yeah, and I said, what's going on?
2295260	2296900	I saw a colleague of mine on the street.
2296900	2299060	She said, do you know what's happening out there?
2299060	2301020	I was like, no, you mean the article?
2301020	2303620	Yeah, oh, she said it's much bigger than you think.
2303620	2305420	By the time I got back to my desk,
2305420	2309700	I mean, thousands of hate mails filling up my email box,
2309700	2313660	such that my email at Portland State
2313660	2314940	stopped accepting new emails.
2314940	2317580	It crashed my email box, basically.
2317580	2319940	And then two petitions started up, right?
2319940	2323220	One petitioned by a woman who was a graduate
2323220	2325460	of interpretive dance in the UK.
2326180	2327980	You just can't make it up, OK?
2327980	2333860	Saying stop reading the Third World Quarterly,
2333860	2335700	punish the Third World Quarterly.
2335700	2340700	The other started by a tenured academic at Syracuse University
2340700	2344980	called Farhana Sultana from Bangladesh,
2344980	2347740	who obviously didn't get the message when she migrated
2347740	2349700	to the United States that this is a free country
2349700	2352100	and we're supposed to uphold academic freedom.
2352100	2354460	A Princeton graduate, by the way.
2354460	2356580	My alma mater.
2356580	2360900	Farhana Sultana said that we demand
2360900	2362460	the article be retracted.
2362460	2365820	We demand that both Gilly and the editor of the Third World
2365820	2367380	Quarterly apologize.
2367380	2370620	And then, separately, on her Facebook page,
2370620	2375980	she started a petition to have my PhD from Princeton to vote.
2375980	2379220	And so by the time it was all said and done,
2379220	2384100	more than 40,000 people had signed these two petitions.
2384100	2386180	And ultimately, the way it was resolved
2386180	2389100	was the editorial staff of the Third World
2389100	2391540	Quarterly in London were getting death threats.
2391540	2392060	Right.
2392060	2393020	Credible death threats.
2393020	2394220	Yes, credible death threats.
2394220	2398140	And the Metropolitan Police said to them,
2398140	2400820	we can't promise you safety.
2400820	2403540	We don't assign bodyguard units to everybody.
2403540	2406580	So the editor called me.
2406580	2407740	The editor called me.
2407740	2409580	And I said, of course, retract it.
2409580	2411140	Withdrawed is the correct term.
2411140	2411620	Withdrawed.
2411620	2412460	Was not retracted.
2412460	2416420	It was withdrawn by me for the physical safety of the staff
2416420	2420260	there, reprinted in academic questions, separate journal,
2420260	2423620	and then eventually formed the core of the book that's
2423620	2424620	the case for colonialism.
2424620	2427820	OK, so this is so fascinating to me
2427820	2430820	and so many others, because I had people coming up to me
2430820	2433420	when I defended you for that.
2433420	2438380	And I actually sent out some emails to people saying,
2438380	2440260	because there was something at PSU, right,
2440260	2442340	where they wanted you sanctioned.
2442340	2446300	They wanted you to tell us about that.
2446300	2448940	Right, so I got a lot of hate mail from PSU as well.
2448940	2453180	Eventually, the provost at the time issued a statement.
2453180	2456020	This was like within a week of the outburst.
2456020	2459580	And I mean, this is like a provost statement on the issue
2459580	2464100	saying, Dr. Gilley published this article.
2464100	2470380	It doesn't represent the views of the faculty at Portland State.
2470420	2472580	Some people say he should be fired,
2472580	2475980	but we have this thing called academic freedom.
2475980	2480300	So we encourage people to debate and discuss and rebut his
2480300	2482140	arguments.
2482140	2485340	I suppose people said that was a good response,
2485340	2489100	because she was saying we can't act.
2489100	2491620	To me, it was a lame-ass response,
2491620	2495020	because she said we can't act.
2495020	2498380	In other words, if I could fire this guy, I would.
2498380	2499940	Unfortunately, we have this problem
2499940	2503300	called academic freedom, which protects right-wing fascists
2503300	2504380	like Gilley.
2504380	2508140	And if we fired him, we'd be violating our state
2508140	2510060	constitution, which we would be in addition
2510060	2511900	to his academic freedom.
2511900	2517460	It was hardly we are dismayed that our faculty members have
2517460	2520780	participated in the mob to silence Dr. Gilley,
2520780	2524380	because so many PSU faculty members signed those petitions,
2524380	2526380	including one who's now my departmental colleague,
2526380	2528700	because her department failed, and we acquired it.
2528700	2531140	See, that's fascinating to me, because I don't know if I've
2531140	2535460	told you this, but I caught massive shit for defending you
2535460	2537140	and saying, and I sent out emails,
2537140	2539940	and I said, if you have a problem with this,
2539940	2541100	because there was a vote.
2541100	2543620	I can't remember what was something like someone voted.
2543620	2545900	And I said, I'd like to find all those people who voted,
2545900	2549700	and I'd like to moderate a debate on stage between you
2549700	2551180	and Dr. Gilley.
2551180	2552820	And guess how many people took that up?
2552820	2553380	Right.
2553380	2553900	Zero.
2553900	2556660	So yeah, there was an attempt at a faculty resolution
2556660	2559820	condemning me that failed.
2559820	2562020	So it was those people, I think.
2562020	2565540	I said, everybody who I said, I'd like to have you on stage.
2565540	2568620	So if you have a problem with this, that's great,
2568620	2571460	that you're totally entitled to do that.
2571460	2574300	Let's go on stage, and we'll have that public conversation.
2574300	2574980	We'll be free.
2574980	2576660	We'll throw through through some student unit,
2576660	2578060	and we'll have that conversation.
2578060	2580220	Nobody took me up on it.
2580220	2581020	Zero.
2581020	2583380	So they were against something, but they don't feel,
2583380	2587460	they don't know enough about what they're against to feel
2587460	2588900	that they can defend it.
2588900	2591140	Well, what they told themselves is,
2591140	2593620	this is like agreeing to a debate on the Holocaust.
2593620	2596620	And I won't participate in this because it would just
2596620	2598700	normalize this as a debate.
2598700	2600140	This is not debatable.
2600140	2603060	Colonialism was evil, lock stock and barrel.
2603060	2606380	And even having the temerity to ask me to debate it
2606380	2608820	shows how unreformed you are.
2608820	2610660	And we really need to shut this down.
2610660	2612100	So OK, whatever.
2612140	2614180	That's just the totalitarian mindset.
2614180	2617940	But having failed at the faculty senate level,
2617940	2623020	the faculty union really just Jennifer Ruth, a film studies
2623020	2625100	professor who was the academic freedom
2625100	2628220	director at the faculty union, who later wrote a book,
2628220	2630180	Attacking Me and Other Faculty Members.
2630180	2633300	Got how well is that academic freedom?
2633300	2634180	Academic freedom director.
2634180	2636700	So the faculty union passed a resolution
2636700	2638060	condemning my research.
2638060	2639940	I call it a fatwa, because that's what it is.
2639940	2640780	It's still out there.
2640780	2643060	They haven't revoked the fatwa.
2643060	2646180	So I'm still under fatwa from the PSU faculty union.
2646180	2649580	And then my department chair, Melody Valdini,
2649580	2653220	commissioned a report from some of our senior colleagues
2653220	2655500	about how I could be shut down, what
2655500	2658220	they could do to curtail me or silence me,
2658220	2660500	included things like forcing me to never say
2660500	2663500	I was a PSU faculty member.
2663500	2670060	And passing a faculty resolution condemning my research
2670060	2674500	and requiring me to pre-notify the faculty chair any time
2674500	2677900	I was about to publish an article or an essay that
2677900	2681180	might potentially be controversial.
2681180	2685060	Only me would be subject to this.
2685060	2689660	She then convenes a secret meeting of everyone except me
2689660	2691460	to talk about this.
2691460	2693180	And then they have a departmental meeting
2693180	2695860	to vote on it, which I don't go to.
2695860	2697540	Neither does one of my senior colleagues
2697540	2699180	who thinks the whole thing is obnoxious.
2699220	2702540	And the resolution passes.
2702540	2704140	You just can't make it up.
2704140	2705140	You can't make it up.
2705140	2708220	So according to my faculty right now,
2708220	2710180	I'm subject to these special burdens.
2710180	2712980	I'm not supposed to say I work at Portland State.
2712980	2716260	I'm supposed to notify my chair any time
2716260	2720500	about to write something controversial.
2720500	2725300	And I'm not supposed to engage further in the colonialism
2725300	2726380	debate in the classroom.
2729180	2731220	You can see how closely I've abided by that, right?
2731220	2732780	Because they're completely out of line.
2732780	2733820	But what does this tell you?
2733820	2737460	I mean, so this isn't this passed by a majority
2737460	2739820	of vote of my own department.
2739820	2741260	You're tenured and you're a senior.
2741260	2742500	Of course I'm fully tenured, yeah.
2742500	2743980	Well, I just want to make clear.
2743980	2745820	Then you're a full professor.
2745820	2747820	Yeah, then that department chair tried
2747820	2749740	to prevent me getting post-tenure reviews.
2749740	2752460	OK, so can we talk about that?
2752460	2753780	I find that fascinating.
2753780	2757940	So last time I looked, and I haven't looked recently,
2757940	2761060	there was a list of faculty member.
2761060	2763620	And I don't know the metrics for this.
2763620	2765740	I would imagine that just you aggregate something
2765740	2766620	from Google Scholar.
2766620	2770180	But I don't really know of the people who most
2770180	2771700	published in the university.
2771700	2774660	Your name is consistently in the top 10.
2774660	2775940	Consistently in the top 10.
2775940	2777700	And the only one in our department,
2777700	2779380	the only one in our school of government,
2779380	2781100	the only one of two in our college.
2781100	2787700	OK, and we can edit this out if this is too revealing.
2790260	2792740	Wasn't the thing about the post-tenure review
2792740	2794860	they said you didn't publish enough?
2794860	2798340	There was something in there about that, wasn't it?
2798340	2799540	Yes, yes, yes.
2799540	2802780	My publication record was insufficient.
2802780	2805460	Of course, it's since tenure, right?
2805460	2807900	But I'd published a lot since getting tenure.
2807900	2809140	Four journal articles.
2809140	2810180	More than Clotting Gay.
2810180	2811820	Three books.
2811820	2815260	And the argument was, but the real argument
2815260	2818980	was the case for colonialism discredited all
2818980	2822260	of my prior scholarship because it was just clickbait
2822260	2823980	for right-wing websites.
2823980	2828260	And the fact that it had been withdrawn just showed
2828260	2830300	it was academically flawed.
2830300	2833540	In other words, intentionally ignoring
2833540	2836620	the facts of the case about why it was withdrawn, which
2836620	2838860	was not any problem with the peer review process.
2839500	2841740	Physical safety of the staff was why it was withdrawn.
2841740	2843100	It had nothing to do with the academic.
2843100	2845700	And then she had the temerity to say,
2845700	2849260	all those citations to the case for colonialism
2849260	2854460	are really just evidence of an academic network
2854460	2857220	trying to boost his citation count.
2857220	2859100	And no, look at the citations.
2859100	2864180	They're from gender studies and coloniality weekly.
2864180	2865740	They're all mostly critical citations.
2865740	2867940	But whatever, my job as an academic
2867980	2870340	is to stimulate others to think more.
2870340	2871700	And citations reflect.
2871700	2872940	I'm glad you look at it, by the way.
2872940	2874060	I'm glad you look at it like that.
2874060	2877620	Citations reflect the extent to which people feel your work
2877620	2880260	engages them, whether for good or for bad.
2880260	2882380	Yeah, by the way, just as a parenthetical,
2882380	2884980	the conceptual penis is a social construct.
2884980	2890100	Most papers in the humanity, I think it's some.
2890100	2896300	So this is a little fuzzy because someone, when this originally
2896300	2900100	came out, they mixed commentary, as you said before.
2900100	2907980	But I think 75% percent of papers in the humanities
2907980	2910420	are cited between zero and one times.
2910420	2911700	So that's amazing.
2911700	2913180	The conceptual penis has been cited.
2913180	2915980	I don't even know how many times, but dozens of times.
2915980	2917540	Well, now it has an afterlife.
2917540	2918900	It has an afterlife.
2918900	2919900	But so here's.
2919900	2923620	Because it's now cited as an article that
2923620	2927740	was a hoax article as part of the discussion on epistemiology.
2927740	2930060	Which is still cited.
2930060	2935020	I think it's in the top 1% or higher of all gender studies
2935020	2936500	articles.
2936500	2937660	It's crazy.
2937660	2939460	So I'm one of the most cited gender studies
2939460	2941340	scholars of all time.
2941340	2943060	But I just, before.
2943060	2944060	You dick.
2944060	2948780	I can't help myself.
2948780	2950660	OK, so I want to talk about, because I've
2950660	2952780	been thinking about this.
2952780	2955220	Before we delve into the case of colonialism,
2955220	2958100	I want to talk about what you're saying about the citations.
2958100	2962140	Because I don't think that's a particularly good.
2962140	2964540	I think it's a very broad metric.
2964540	2967660	Because again, I only want to go to Claudine Gaye right now.
2967660	2968820	Because I've read her stuff.
2968820	2970660	And her stuff has hundreds of citations.
2970660	2974140	I think my most cited article is like 500 and something.
2974140	2976460	It's like behaviorism, constructivism, and saccharic
2976460	2977900	pedigar or something.
2977980	2980580	But her stuff is picked up by a bunch
2980580	2982340	of all these race hucksters.
2982340	2984180	They just cite their own things.
2984180	2987180	And it artificially props up the citation rate.
2987180	2989380	So you can't just look at the h-index
2989380	2991380	or the number of citations.
2991380	2993980	And that's, I mean, it kind of tells you something.
2993980	2995460	But it kind of does not tell you something.
2995460	2997180	It's what we call a rough indicator, right?
2997180	2997860	It's a rough indicator.
2997860	2999460	It's a rough indicator that has a lot
2999460	3002100	of what we call reliability problems.
3002100	3004700	Which means there's a lot of noise in that indicator, right?
3005460	3008860	So it is probably generally tracking
3008860	3010700	scholarly productivity.
3010700	3012940	But there's a lot of noise in that indicator
3012940	3015020	because of the sorts of things you talk about.
3015020	3016740	Where you publish, whether it just
3016740	3020020	takes one other scholar to cite it in a way
3020020	3023300	that it becomes a kind of what we call a reflexive citation
3023300	3024100	for others.
3024100	3027620	Like every time you write about topic X, you cite this one.
3027620	3029940	And none of those people have ever read your article.
3029940	3031420	It's called a junk citation.
3031420	3033900	If you become a junk citation, your citation
3034060	3036060	goes off the charts because everyone just
3036060	3037860	feels they need to cite you.
3037860	3040460	So every time someone writes an article about topic X,
3040460	3041300	they always throw this in.
3041300	3042180	It's a junk citation.
3042180	3042860	They never read it.
3042860	3043980	They never thought about it.
3043980	3044940	But it's just there.
3044940	3047380	So there's a lot of noise on the upside.
3047380	3049580	There's a lot of noise on the downside, too.
3049580	3054020	So some really important articles don't get cited much
3054020	3057540	because people end up not citing the original or even
3057540	3058980	knowing that was the original.
3058980	3063660	Because it's someone else who talked about that issue, who
3063660	3065020	gets all the citations.
3065020	3068060	So you can be deflated down and you can be deflated up.
3068060	3068980	Yeah, it's good.
3068980	3071380	I think I like the idea that it's rough.
3071380	3073140	I mean, I remember when I went up for promotion,
3073140	3077620	I had a higher H index than anybody on my committee
3077620	3079020	than my department chair, everyone.
3079020	3083740	And again, I think that there's a kind of anti-meritocratic
3083740	3086580	element, particularly operative at PSU.
3086580	3089500	OK, so anyway, back to the case for colonialism.
3089500	3092940	So you can kind of, or you can figure out
3092940	3094100	the thesis from the title.
3094100	3096460	This is not a particularly complicated thing.
3096460	3099580	And I think because it was so easy to grasp,
3099580	3103700	that people picked up on it and just went completely bananas.
3103700	3107700	So when you started the interview off,
3107700	3109620	when I said you sat down with my son and I,
3109620	3113700	and you explained it to me, and it was like a massive light bulb.
3113700	3115220	Do you remember that conversation?
3115220	3115940	Yeah.
3115940	3121140	And so could you explain in a nutshell for people
3121140	3124900	who are not familiar with historical colonialism,
3124900	3127740	like what in a nutshell is the case for colonialism?
3127740	3129980	And why does it matter that people,
3129980	3131620	beyond the academic controversies,
3131620	3135660	like why does this subject matter?
3135660	3139460	So the easiest way to think about the case for colonialism
3139460	3142740	is it's a bit like saying the case for oxygen in the atmosphere.
3142740	3146180	Like, do you really think we'd be here
3146180	3147740	if there were no oxygen in the atmosphere?
3147740	3152900	Colonialism wasn't a bunch of people in pith hats
3152900	3154740	jumping into a ship with guns and say,
3154740	3157380	let's go repress and conquer black people.
3157380	3160340	Colonialism was part of a huge structural transformation
3160340	3163740	of the world that began with the rise of Europe
3163740	3166860	and the separation of European development from the rest.
3166860	3169420	The great divergence it's called in economic history,
3169420	3173020	when the Europe just took off politically, economically,
3173020	3176660	socially, organizationally, militarily, technologically.
3176660	3180300	Suddenly this huge gap emerged between Europe and the rest.
3180300	3183020	Now, when is that post-Renaissance?
3183020	3187860	So 17th, 1600s, basically, early 1600s.
3187860	3191700	I mean, Britain's first colonies are like Bermuda, 1603.
3191700	3194180	This is the first time, the Spanish and the Portuguese.
3194180	3196580	And then this accelerates all the way through the 19th century
3196580	3198300	into the early 20th century.
3198300	3204860	So Europe was spreading out whether you liked it or not.
3204900	3206580	So this is the first thing to remember.
3206580	3209940	People assume there's some kind of volunteerism all the time.
3209940	3211900	They decided, they sat down and said,
3211900	3213740	let's go colonize the world.
3213740	3215620	Never happened.
3215620	3218700	Europe spread out because it had things to trade.
3218700	3219740	It had guns.
3219740	3221580	It had shipping technology.
3221580	3222740	It had missionaries.
3222740	3224180	It had explorers.
3224180	3225820	It had scientists.
3225820	3229300	It had people who were interested in establishing
3229300	3231380	understanding of foreign cultures.
3231380	3234220	All this was going to happen no matter
3234220	3236860	whether governments were part of it or not.
3236860	3239460	Europe was coming for the world.
3239460	3241060	It was going to engage the world.
3241060	3243500	So that's the first thing to remember.
3243500	3246100	What we call the push factors were not governments
3246100	3248300	like planning colonial expeditions.
3248300	3252180	It was simply this massively advanced civilization
3252180	3253740	expanding around the world.
3253740	3259300	Second part, on the demand side, almost always,
3259300	3260820	these people were welcomed.
3260820	3262740	The relationships were friendly.
3262740	3263540	Why?
3263540	3266740	Because the Europeans offered things that were useful.
3266740	3268060	They brought food.
3268060	3269300	They brought metal.
3269300	3270900	They brought technology.
3270900	3273620	They often brought protection from a local rival.
3273620	3277100	I mean, the way that Nigeria became a British colony
3277100	3279660	is basically that the king of Lagos
3279660	3283300	had been chased off his throne by internal rivals.
3283300	3286060	And he asked the British to come on shore
3286060	3287140	and put him back on his seat.
3287140	3289580	And his local ally said, yes, please come.
3289580	3291860	And for God's sake, colonize us.
3291900	3295180	Because otherwise, we're going to be swamped and degraded
3295180	3298460	and enslaved by this group that's slightly to the north of us.
3298460	3301740	And that's the common pattern of how European colonialism
3301740	3305860	was established, was we call these the pull factors.
3305860	3310700	Local populations almost always welcomed, collaborated with,
3310700	3314740	cooperated with, or at least accommodated,
3314740	3317060	the European expansion.
3317060	3321340	So the idea of force and resistance is nonsense.
3321340	3323700	It's not a historically accurate picture
3323700	3328820	of how Europe came to occupy through colonial control,
3328820	3331060	depending on how you look at it, 2-thirds or 3-quarters
3331060	3332260	of the globe.
3332260	3335540	So in part, there's no case to be made
3335540	3338620	other than it's like the case for volcanoes or something.
3338620	3340820	Like, we don't decide whether or not
3340820	3342260	there are volcanoes in the world.
3342260	3343540	There just are.
3343540	3345340	Colonialism was of that sort.
3345340	3347100	It just was going to happen.
3347100	3350540	It's a classic example of civilizational rise
3350540	3352820	and expansion that's happened throughout human history.
3352820	3354300	OK, so what about this guy?
3354300	3356780	Wasn't King Leopold like a real, I mean,
3356780	3360860	my conception is he's a real, just a true, nasty son
3360860	3363180	of a bitch who used to chop off?
3363180	3364100	No, no, all wrong.
3364100	3365580	In fact, I have an article.
3365580	3368420	One of the chapters is called Indefensive Leopold's Congo.
3368420	3370900	So most people's understanding of the Congo Free State,
3370900	3373900	which was before the Belgian takeover of that.
3373900	3379420	So this was a private colony rather than a Belgian colony,
3379420	3383460	it comes from Adam Haas Child's book, King Leopold's Ghost,
3383460	3386100	which I've shown is a vast fabrication.
3386100	3386500	It's strange.
3386500	3388780	There was no population.
3388780	3392740	I have to tell you this, the way where I got that from
3392740	3399260	is my kid, my son, I'm actually his name,
3399260	3407500	brought home papers in his senior year from that book.
3407500	3408540	And that's where I read it.
3408540	3409700	And that's where I got that.
3409700	3411060	So he got that in the schools.
3411060	3412300	Yeah, so I just wanted to tell you.
3412300	3416460	So Haas Child had an incredibly deleterious impact
3416460	3419780	on our understanding of the Congo Free State with his book,
3419780	3423140	King Leopold's Ghost, 1998.
3423140	3428020	So the way I, so here's the facts about the Congo Free State
3428020	3432500	is it was an ungoverned and ungovernable part of Africa
3432500	3434900	that none of the colonial powers could enter.
3434900	3439060	Because A, the mortality rates were about 20% per year
3439060	3443660	for a European there because of disease and climate.
3443660	3447020	Slave trading and inter-tribal warfare was rampant.
3447020	3449980	Even the British could not stop the slave trading
3449980	3451180	in the central Congo.
3451180	3453420	Those slaves were taken to Eastern Africa
3453420	3454980	and onto the Arab area.
3454980	3456980	So this is the East African slave trade run
3456980	3460140	by the Arabs and the Indians.
3460140	3465140	And King Leopold said, let me try to establish
3465340	3466820	at least some trading stations
3466820	3468220	and some navigable rivers there.
3468220	3470460	That was the deal, okay?
3470460	3475460	Now, King Leopold's Congo managed to create a railway
3477060	3479740	up into the central part of the country
3479740	3481980	and certain amount of stability
3481980	3486620	by stopping slave trading and inter-tribal warfare
3486620	3489420	with a very thin amount of people, very few, right?
3489420	3491180	It's still vastly unexplored.
3491180	3493900	And as a result of that population,
3493900	3496460	probably slightly increased,
3496460	3498860	maybe there was a decrease because of the rise
3498860	3500980	of sleeping sickness and some endemic diseases
3500980	3501980	that were coming in.
3501980	3504660	But basically, it was an amazingly positive contribution
3504660	3505620	to the people of the Congo.
3505620	3509100	Now, in a very small part, about 10% of that territory,
3509100	3512940	they grew rubber and instead of forced labor requirements,
3512940	3514540	they imposed rubber quotas.
3514540	3516500	So, you know, when you're running a government,
3516500	3517940	you need to pay for the government.
3517940	3519500	There's three ways to do it.
3519500	3520700	You can tax people,
3520700	3523860	but if they have no money, taxation's not feasible.
3523860	3526860	Most common way to use it then is forced labor, right?
3526860	3527860	It's called Corvée labor.
3527860	3530660	You pay your taxes in terms of labor.
3530660	3534180	In the rubber areas, the labor was demanded
3534180	3536500	in terms of the delivery of rubber quotas
3536500	3538100	from different villages.
3538100	3541580	Now, in most of these areas, the rubber came very easily.
3541580	3544260	In other parts of these rubber areas,
3544260	3547300	the local militias who were hired
3547300	3551100	by the Belgian rubber companies engaged
3551100	3554980	in coercive practices to get the locals to bring in the rubber.
3554980	3557340	And there were some atrocities, for sure.
3557340	3562340	I estimate maybe 10,000 Belgian black Congolese died
3563140	3565660	in skirmishers or conflicts
3565660	3569220	between the Belgian rubber companies.
3569220	3570900	Now, don't forget, these are black militias,
3570900	3572140	but it's black on black conflict.
3572140	3576660	Nonetheless, the rubber companies and the local, 10,000.
3576660	3578220	Terrible number, but don't forget,
3578220	3581260	we're talking about a country of 10 million at this point.
3581260	3582780	And that is the worst of it.
3582780	3586060	All those pictures you see of severed limbs are either fake,
3586060	3589860	meaning those are people who had their hands cut off
3589860	3591260	because of gangrene
3591260	3594260	or because they had their hands cut off in battles
3594260	3598180	or when you see them holding the hands of people,
3598180	3600820	that's because it was tribal custom in Congo.
3600860	3603700	When you were issued a rifle with 10 bullets,
3603700	3605940	if you came back with only eight bullets,
3605940	3607820	you needed to show that those two bullets
3607820	3609620	had been used to kill others.
3609620	3612180	And you would cut their hands off and the hands had showed,
3612180	3615140	and this was typically soldier on soldier conflict,
3615140	3618540	not against villagers who didn't turn in their rubber quotas.
3618540	3622020	So the British Congo reformers realized
3622020	3623820	that if they could show some pictures of people
3623820	3625900	with severed hands and say this is King Leopold's
3625900	3628220	rubber minions, that it would spark outrage,
3628220	3629340	because what they really wanted
3629340	3631060	was the Brits to colonize the Congo.
3631060	3634620	And it did some, it created a movement in support of this,
3634620	3636780	but a vast amount of lies and propaganda,
3636780	3639380	which Adam Hochschild repeats in his book,
3639380	3642980	says that 10 million people died from the British,
3642980	3645700	from the Belgian Congolese, not the Belgian King Leopold's
3645700	3647900	Congolese rubber operations, complete nonsense.
3647900	3650540	And how do we know that figure is wrong?
3650540	3653780	Because demographers in the 70s, 80s and 90s
3653780	3656580	started to go back and do the data calculations.
3656580	3657900	1970s, 80s and 90s.
3657900	3660500	Yeah, mainly the 80s and 90s is when they finally
3660500	3662020	got good enough evidence.
3662020	3666100	And demographers estimating population,
3666100	3668500	it shows the population is basically flat the whole time.
3668500	3671260	Because despite the downward pressure on population
3671260	3674420	caused by endemic disease, King Leopold's Congo
3674420	3678540	was maintaining stability, food supplies were rising,
3678540	3680580	slave operations were declining.
3680580	3683460	So his contribution was very positive.
3683460	3685340	There was a negative countervailing effect
3685340	3688020	from endemic disease, which was coming in.
3688020	3690620	And the net result was basically a flat population.
3690620	3693980	Well, OK, that's fascinating, because that totally upends.
3693980	3694660	Totally different.
3694660	3698100	I mean, and if you try to go on Wikipedia, and correct.
3698100	3699340	Well, Wikipedia is a corrupt system.
3699340	3703380	Yeah, if you try and correct any of those fake facts
3703380	3705660	on Wikipedia, you'll get immediately edited out.
3705660	3707540	Which I don't do, because I know it's going to happen.
3707540	3709860	But friends of mine who do this say that they
3709860	3711260	keep trying to indicate.
3711260	3712700	OK, now, so that's another.
3712700	3714820	The corruption of Wikipedia is another story.
3714820	3716700	That's a totally, I don't want to go on the road,
3716700	3717900	Wikipedia is corrupt.
3717900	3718860	OK, so.
3718860	3723660	But just imagine how pernicious a myth that
3723660	3727260	is of, because it often gets raised in this debate, right?
3727260	3729060	Well, what about the Congo?
3729060	3729540	Yeah.
3729540	3731100	You know, wasn't the Congo terrible?
3731100	3732020	That's what I was thinking.
3732020	3733340	Yeah, no, it wasn't actually.
3733340	3735180	It was amazingly positive.
3735180	3737580	Black lives mattered to King Leopold.
3737580	3742300	And he did an amazing thing to support them.
3742300	3744380	And yet, and just imagine how pernicious.
3744380	3746380	Now, I caught Adam Rothschild actually
3746380	3749100	doctoring a quotation in his book.
3749100	3751340	And he recognized he had doctored it.
3751340	3753740	And he apologized and said, well, that's good.
3753740	3755940	I said, I hope it gets corrected.
3755940	3756980	Basically, he taken up.
3756980	3758620	Oh, that's a good attitude.
3758620	3764060	Yeah, but I mean, so it's just like I said, A was not A.
3764060	3766620	And I'm sorry about that, but it anchored my whole tale.
3766620	3770220	Maybe he should cancel the book or give a speech.
3770220	3772740	He basically took a Belgian official who said,
3772740	3775380	I don't think we should be going in and forcing
3775380	3778700	coercive rubber harvesting because otherwise, we'll
3778700	3782460	just be like the Arabs who would cut off hands and feet.
3782460	3784100	He doctored that quotation to say,
3784100	3785540	if we're going to do rubber harvesting,
3785540	3787900	we're going to have to be cutting off hands and feet.
3787900	3791580	Oh, that's a significant big.
3791580	3793660	Completely inverted the meeting, right?
3793660	3794020	Yeah.
3794020	3795700	And that's how his book operates in my view.
3795700	3796980	And it's a complete verse.
3796980	3798740	So one of the things that you said
3798740	3801820	that was so interesting to me, and again, this
3801860	3805380	way outside my area of expertise, excuse me,
3805380	3810100	is that you said, when you think about colonialism,
3810100	3812700	you have to think about what the alternative is.
3812700	3817340	And people vote with their feet and where do they go?
3817340	3821500	And so I want you to please talk a little bit about what
3821500	3823260	was the alternative and what did you
3823260	3826580	mean by people vote with their feet?
3826580	3829060	Yeah, so the alternative clearly is not
3829100	3832460	well-governed, stable, prosperous societies.
3832460	3835460	Nowhere that was colonized was like that.
3835460	3838980	India, which has to take a lot of time in any analysis
3838980	3841860	because it's two-thirds of the colonial experience
3841860	3845340	because of the people, was in the midst of the collapse
3845340	3846940	of the Mughal dynasty.
3846940	3850820	And the attempt by Natar Shah of Persia
3850820	3854660	to replace the Mughal empire with a Persian empire, which
3854660	3856900	would have been much more bloody and violent.
3856980	3861980	And these little feudal fiefdoms that
3861980	3864820	were left over from the collapse of the Mughal dynasty
3864820	3867500	were fighting amongst each other.
3867500	3870620	So when the British showed up, the East India Company
3870620	3874420	in the first instance showed up, started establishing forts
3874420	3877420	that were essentially trading forts, what do you know?
3877420	3881100	Within years, people started moving closer to the fort.
3881100	3882100	Why?
3882100	3884620	Why would they escape the wonderful life
3884620	3890060	of being a lower caste Hindu under a Maharaja whose job
3890060	3892300	was to pick up the shit of the Hindu elites
3892300	3894580	for the rest of your life and all of your generations to come?
3894580	3897140	Why on earth would you go and live near the British East
3897140	3898420	India Company's fort?
3898420	3901140	A, you had security.
3901140	3902940	B, you had job opportunities.
3902940	3905300	C, if you were from a lower caste,
3905300	3908660	you might work for the British army in a canteen.
3908660	3910660	Hell, even cleaning their latrines would be better.
3910660	3912340	Building their forts, you suddenly
3912340	3915420	escape from social oppression.
3915420	3920540	You're suddenly going to be in a modern area with access
3920540	3924060	to technology and running water, maybe,
3924060	3926260	because the forts started to expand, right?
3926260	3928820	So people were voting with their feet already.
3928820	3930420	Once the Indian mutiny happens, which
3930420	3933500	is actually a small minority of the Indian troops
3933500	3936460	of the East India Company, and the British decide
3936460	3938380	the government has got out of control,
3938380	3940220	like this was supposed to be a trading venture.
3940220	3941700	It's now basically a government.
3941700	3944460	So they formalize it becomes the government of India.
3944460	3947740	Then we see this massive influx of Indians
3947740	3951060	into the most heavily colonized cities, right?
3951060	3955460	Calcutta, Hyderabad, Bombay, New Delhi.
3955460	3956300	Because why?
3956300	3959180	Why are people moving closer to colonialism
3959180	3961580	if colonialism is so terrible for them?
3961580	3963700	Shouldn't they be fleeing into the mountains?
3963700	3965740	Shouldn't they abandoning the cities?
3965740	3967100	No, of course they're not.
3967100	3968540	They're moving closer in.
3968540	3970820	They're trying to get into the English education systems.
3970820	3972820	Eventually they're trying to send all their kids to Eaton,
3972820	3975380	an oxbridge, where they become tenured professors
3975380	3977420	and denounce colonialism, of course.
3977420	3981460	But it's the hypocrisy of the anti-colonialists
3981460	3986660	who don't want to recognize how much their forebears wanted,
3986660	3990660	sought to be part of, engaged with, benefited from,
3990660	3993860	and recognize the benefits of the colonial experience
3993860	3997500	compared to what would have happened otherwise.
3997500	4000740	See, that's fascinating to me.
4000740	4005300	What do you make of this fact that in Hong Kong
4005300	4008460	during the uprisings a few years ago,
4008460	4010580	there were flying American flags?
4010580	4011980	And British flags.
4011980	4014140	Incorrect, and British flags.
4014140	4016940	And it kind of goes...
4016940	4019220	Melissa Chen was the person who gave me this idea.
4019220	4021140	It kind of goes against that narrative.
4021140	4024140	I think I read something she wrote about that.
4024140	4027300	It goes against the anti-colonial narrative
4027300	4029260	where these are people who are colonized
4029260	4033420	and they're flying American and British flags.
4033420	4035860	So there is a...
4035860	4039620	Even to say, as you're the world expert in this,
4039620	4042660	and you would note that there is a case for colonialism,
4042660	4051660	even that sets people off in a kind of deranged frenzy.
4051660	4055500	So even to make that suggestion...
4055500	4058740	So is the reason for that, and I'm speculating...
4058740	4061140	Tell me if my reasoning is off, my speculation is off.
4061140	4065780	Is the reason for that because they look at...
4065780	4067220	It's kind of like Israel in a sense.
4067220	4070420	They look at Israel as a penetration of Western values.
4070420	4073300	They look at colonialism as the penetration of Western values.
4073300	4075740	And they view the West as kind of the wellspring
4075740	4077140	of all things that are bad.
4077140	4080660	Is that the basic oversimplified idea?
4080660	4083780	So there is definitely a derangement syndrome going on here.
4083820	4085940	I mean, Israel derangement syndrome,
4085940	4087620	colonialism derangement syndrome,
4087620	4092180	which you mentioned the idea and it sets them off
4092180	4096700	in a kind of a lunatic rage of an inability
4096700	4100820	to think constructively or dispassionately about an issue.
4100820	4102620	And to form arguments against it too.
4102620	4103820	That's the other part of the syndrome.
4103820	4106140	Yeah, or to even be willing to engage
4106140	4108380	in the historical evidence or debate.
4108380	4112580	And I caught out this professor,
4114700	4116780	one of those who wrote a long article against me,
4116780	4118460	who was a professor, a tenure professor
4118460	4120220	in African studies and whatnot.
4120220	4123340	And I basically took his essay
4123340	4125460	and found that none of the quotations he used
4125460	4127860	actually said what he said they said.
4127860	4129020	Did he publish it?
4129020	4129860	Yes.
4129860	4130940	Where did he publish it?
4130940	4133460	It was an essay in the Washington Post.
4133460	4134820	Oh, so it wasn't peer reviewed then?
4134820	4136780	No, no, but I mean, he's a scholar.
4137380	4140460	He's basically trading on his academic credentials
4140460	4141940	and saying, well, here's the...
4141940	4143820	Yeah, it's actually worse that it's in the Washington Post.
4143820	4146340	It's worse, yeah, because he's saying, just trust me,
4146340	4147580	I'm an academic.
4147580	4150420	And here's the quote, here's the citation.
4151420	4153380	Whoa, go through every single one.
4153380	4154660	That's not what it says.
4154660	4155500	That's not what it says.
4155500	4157140	And he probably hasn't even read it before.
4157140	4159060	So what is this telling you?
4159060	4161380	This is telling you that it's no longer
4161380	4163620	an area of academic inquiry,
4164620	4168220	by which we mean evidence, data, hypothesis,
4168220	4170300	falsification, debate, right?
4170300	4173060	It's an area of ideology.
4173060	4175540	It's an area of totalitarian thinking.
4175540	4177860	And so for someone again,
4177860	4179620	to step outside of the people,
4181220	4184780	elicits a kind of Maoist reaction
4184780	4186540	as it did in the Cultural Revolution
4186540	4188020	and all the other Maoist movements,
4188020	4191940	which is beat the dog when they fall in the gutter,
4191940	4193660	as they say in Chinese, you know?
4193660	4197220	I mean, this is just an outrage against civilization.
4197220	4198340	It's a terrible expression.
4198340	4199180	Yeah, yeah.
4204300	4209300	But again, my normal response is, okay,
4210900	4214340	here's my long response to all of your critiques.
4214340	4217740	Sighted, footnoted, double-check my footnotes
4217740	4219300	if you think what I'm saying,
4219300	4220900	the evidence I'm citing doesn't say that,
4220940	4225060	please write a rebuttal, you know, 20,000 words later.
4226500	4229020	What do all those people say in response?
4229020	4230660	Nada.
4230660	4234500	Because it's not really an academic topic anymore, right?
4234500	4238700	And to even say all of your evidence
4238700	4243700	that you've mustered against me is like tofu construction,
4243860	4245140	another Chinese phrase.
4246180	4250300	For them it's like saying Claudia Gay plagiarized.
4250340	4254220	Even to raise that white Eurocentric perspective
4254220	4256420	is just evidence of your white supremacy.
4256420	4258140	You don't get it.
4258140	4259380	The ship has sailed.
4259380	4261460	The ideology is correct.
4261460	4263580	If you didn't get on board with the ideology
4263580	4267260	and you keep raising these old liberal shibboleths against it,
4267260	4270940	it just shows how deeply entrenched the problems are in you,
4270940	4272060	not me.
4272060	4274660	Yeah, it's disparaging
4274660	4277340	because that's the dominant moral orthodoxy right now.
4277380	4280380	That's currently what's in fashion.
4280380	4281860	And it's not as if,
4282700	4287700	it's not only as if a certain conclusion was orthodox,
4289100	4290940	it's a process to get to the conclusion.
4290940	4292260	It's the demeaning of evidence.
4292260	4294060	It's the demeaning of reason.
4294060	4298380	It's the wholesale writing off of datasets.
4298380	4301980	And so that makes the problem much more difficult to solve.
4301980	4304780	It's not like, well, we know the earth is warming
4304780	4306380	or anthropogenic warming, et cetera.
4306420	4307260	So what do we do about it?
4307260	4309740	Those are political considerations based upon dataset.
4309740	4311580	It's you just wipe out the whole dataset.
4311580	4313580	So then you're in, la la la.
4313580	4314980	Because what are you interested in?
4314980	4315980	Truth or power?
4315980	4316900	Correct, right?
4316900	4318860	If you're interested in truth,
4318860	4320500	you're constantly trying to revise,
4320500	4321420	are we doing this right?
4321420	4322580	What's the evidence?
4322580	4324260	If you're interested in power,
4324260	4326220	the truth question doesn't come into it.
4326220	4331220	What ideology will be effective as a tool of us gaining
4331300	4333140	and maintaining and using power?
4333140	4334420	That's the question, right?
4334420	4339420	So anti-colonialism then became decolonization,
4340060	4341940	then became post-colonialism.
4341940	4343980	All of these things, it turns out,
4343980	4346020	had nothing to do with truth.
4346020	4348140	They were ideologies of power.
4348140	4350180	First, they were ideologies of power
4350180	4351620	for the people in the colonies
4351620	4353980	who wanted to take over from the colonial rulers.
4353980	4355260	They'd sit there, look at government houses,
4355260	4357220	saying, wow, it'd be great to sleep there.
4357220	4358940	Sit there and sip whiskies all day,
4358940	4360100	and I'd be served upon.
4360100	4361980	I'd probably retain some of those white staff
4361980	4364380	so I could be served by a white staff member.
4364380	4365820	I mean, the people would go crazy
4365820	4367900	to see a black man served by a white man.
4368900	4373900	Then decolonization, which was taking these societies
4373980	4378060	that had a rule of law, a court system, a high court,
4378060	4381980	property rights, guaranteed freedoms,
4381980	4383820	a meritocratic education system.
4383820	4387020	Decolonize went, I'm taking all that over.
4387020	4389340	I'm nationalizing the cocoa industry.
4389340	4392500	I'm suspending the habeas corpus.
4392500	4394260	I'm seizing property, right?
4394260	4395620	That was decolonization.
4395620	4399780	It was not an ideology of public policy.
4399780	4402580	It was an ideology of power and resources.
4402580	4403420	Fascinating.
4403420	4405260	And then post-colonialism became the same thing.
4405260	4407380	Post-colonialism was to say,
4407380	4411860	we cannot use the rational European way
4411860	4413700	of thinking about the world.
4413700	4416740	We can't expect brown and black people to think that way.
4416740	4419380	We need to adopt a post-colonial perspective
4419380	4421700	so that we don't hold them to those same standards.
4421700	4423780	This is a properly post-colonial view
4423780	4425620	on what you should have
4425620	4427380	in order to be the president of Harvard.
4427380	4431420	Claudine Gay perfectly fits that post-colonial perspective.
4431420	4436180	She wasn't elevated on merit or metrics or competence.
4436180	4438780	That's the colonial mindset we need to decolonize.
4438780	4441180	And we need to have a post-colonial Harvard president.
4441180	4442220	And she was it.
4442220	4446100	And she was glamorous and perfect post-colonialism at Harvard.
4446100	4447620	It's been decolonized.
4447620	4449340	And there it is in its full glory.
4449340	4450660	And that's what you get.
4450660	4452780	Yeah, I actually agree with them.
4452780	4454460	I was really disappointed.
4454460	4457420	I mean, Claudine Gay is the president Harvard deserves.
4457420	4461380	And I was very much disappointed when she resigned.
4461380	4464260	I think I was genuinely she's the president.
4464260	4465900	She's a perfect fit for the university.
4465900	4466740	I couldn't agree.
4466740	4467580	Perfect fit.
4467580	4468420	I couldn't agree more.
4468420	4469260	She's keeping her knowledge.
4469260	4472140	It is the modern decolonized anti-racist university.
4472140	4475660	And I could show you 100 institutes
4475660	4477500	of higher education in the third world
4477500	4479780	that went through exactly that process
4479820	4481540	after the end of the colonial era.
4481540	4484420	And the presidency was seized by some party
4484420	4487220	hack who could barely spell his name.
4487220	4490820	And the research departments were given to party hacks
4490820	4492300	who were not the best in their field.
4492300	4494700	I mean, this was the Soviet Union, right?
4494700	4496140	We're all, I mean, the Soviet Union,
4496140	4499580	the Russian scientific and mathematical tradition
4499580	4502460	used to be unparalleled, top in the world, right?
4502460	4503820	Until the Soviet Union.
4503820	4507700	And all that academic excellence was replaced by ideology.
4507700	4510100	So what it took to be the head of the university was
4510100	4512180	you had to be a good party cadre.
4512180	4514740	What it took to be the head of the agronomics department
4514740	4517220	was you believed in some quack theory
4517220	4519080	that some party hack had invented
4519080	4520980	and that was the only route to the top.
4522140	4527140	So it seems that, well, two things.
4529620	4532020	Why should someone read the case for colonialism?
4532940	4533980	So I start with that one.
4533980	4537420	Yeah, so I think the book brings together
4538060	4540260	the logical evidence-based arguments.
4540260	4545260	And it does so not in the sort of thematic chapter by chapter,
4546420	4548620	but using what I call episodes of colonialism.
4548620	4550180	So I look at specific cases.
4550180	4551660	I look at Malaya.
4551660	4553220	I look at Yemen.
4553220	4554260	I look at India.
4554260	4556260	I look at the Congo.
4556260	4558580	I look at German colonies.
4558580	4562740	I look at specific instances where colonialism took place
4562780	4567980	because I find it a lot easier to deal with instances,
4567980	4569940	places rather than themes.
4569940	4571620	I think it's more accessible.
4571620	4576620	So, and then it's forwarded by the broad thematic arguments.
4577260	4580740	And at the end, I bring in responses to colonialism
4580740	4582820	from two of the great third world intellectuals,
4582820	4586260	Chinua Kebei, which was the article I published,
4586260	4589780	expanded, revised, and then one on V.S. Nipal,
4589820	4593060	who's the Nobel Laureate writer from Trinidad.
4593060	4594580	His book blew me away.
4594580	4596620	Who was, to me, one of the greatest writers
4596620	4597460	of the 20th century.
4597460	4598300	Yeah, totally blew my life.
4598300	4600700	And was only very reluctantly given the Nobel Prize
4600700	4602260	because at a certain point,
4602260	4605300	even the woke Nobel committee could not ignore
4605300	4607060	this man's greatness.
4607060	4608980	And they tried to spin him as an anticolonial writer,
4608980	4609820	which he wasn't.
4610940	4614500	So I think if you want to kind of,
4614500	4616660	and here's what I would say about my book.
4616660	4618260	I'm not an, on the one hand,
4618260	4620100	on the other hand, type of person.
4620100	4623940	I think colonialism was an unmitigated good.
4623940	4627780	That doesn't mean during this entire period of colonialism,
4627780	4629340	a lot of bad stuff didn't happen.
4629340	4630180	Of course it did.
4630180	4632100	We're talking about human societies.
4632100	4633500	If there was not bad stuff,
4633500	4635020	it wouldn't be a human society.
4635020	4640020	What I mean was at the level of the general systemic factors
4640020	4643700	that brought colonialism to being and how it operated
4643700	4645220	and what it left behind,
4645220	4648060	all of that unmitigated good, okay?
4648060	4650420	So, and I think that's what distinguishes my book
4650420	4652740	from my colleague Nigel Bigger's book,
4652740	4654740	Colonials and Memorial Reckoning.
4654740	4656580	Fantastic book.
4656580	4658420	Dr. Bigger, on the other hand,
4658420	4662340	trying very hard to be that terrible tick
4662340	4665540	in the British personality, reasonable, dear fellow.
4665540	4667500	Reasonable, right?
4667500	4668980	And he is reasonable.
4668980	4672660	And so he does try to give more fair play
4672660	4674620	to critical arguments.
4674620	4679220	I just think he's trying a bit too hard to be reasonable
4679220	4682700	in that British manner of not to sure about anything,
4682700	4685860	very practical, you know, I call this the hobbit mentality
4685860	4688980	of like, no adventures and no big theories.
4688980	4690420	So I respect him a lot,
4690420	4693180	but it's really not an argument for colonialism his book is.
4693180	4695860	It's more of a introduction to the debate.
4695860	4698140	Mine is the only, and I would say the same
4698140	4699740	about Nigel Ferguson's book, Empire.
4699740	4700940	Oh, I love that book.
4700940	4702780	Which is great, which is fantastic
4702780	4705580	because he really does bring in a lot of the detail.
4705580	4707980	He also has a kind of thematic introduction.
4707980	4709220	I have a signed copy of that.
4709220	4712140	The five, whatever he calls them, the five super apps
4712140	4714740	of Western civilization, property rights, markets,
4714740	4716220	you know, whatever.
4716220	4718900	But Ferguson's also one of those too clever by,
4718900	4721620	what they call too clever by half in the UK, right?
4721620	4722940	He's a brilliant guy, right?
4722940	4725940	And he's so brilliant that he can't help
4725940	4728100	but throwing in all kinds of little insults
4728100	4730940	and nastinesses about British colonialism
4730940	4734060	because to be a real intellectual
4734060	4736100	in the British tradition, like bigger,
4736100	4737220	need to be balanced, right?
4737220	4739100	Need to be on the one hand on the other hand.
4739100	4741340	Although his general argument is colonialism was great
4741340	4744220	and British Empire created the modern world.
4744220	4746940	Both of them in my mind are a little bit too much of a um,
4746940	4748900	um, on the one hand on the other hand.
4748900	4751020	So if you want a book that simply says,
4751020	4752820	here's the case and here's the evidence
4752820	4755140	and here's why I disagree with these arguments against it.
4755140	4756660	Mine's the only one.
4756660	4758820	All right, that's fascinating.
4758820	4761180	So, so let me ask you this.
4761180	4765380	You are in the twilight of your career,
4765380	4767620	would you say that's fair to say?
4767620	4768460	Yes.
4768460	4772180	And you were approximately the same age
4772180	4775500	and you're going on sabbatical next term.
4777060	4778500	You're at an institution
4778500	4780860	where the vast majority of people despise you.
4781940	4783060	Is that fair to say?
4784060	4785260	Yeah, I think so.
4785660	4787300	At least in the humanities and social sciences.
4787300	4788140	Sure, sure.
4789900	4793780	So what's next for you?
4793780	4797340	I mean, what's next for you?
4797340	4802220	Well, I think there's always this dilemma of
4805180	4806860	when do you leave a sinking ship?
4807980	4810020	And I answered that question.
4810020	4811860	You answered that question.
4811860	4814500	And I don't mean Portland State is sinking.
4814500	4815620	It's a state institution.
4815620	4817180	It'll survive in one form or another.
4817180	4819780	But what I mean is if the intellectual environment
4819780	4821460	is sinking, it disappeared.
4821460	4822620	It's sunk.
4822620	4824220	Then what point do you abandon
4824220	4829220	or what point do you say they should triple my salary?
4829220	4830900	I'm the only thing.
4830900	4831740	Correct.
4831740	4834260	One of the only things keeping this place
4834260	4836660	to some degree intellectually honest.
4838060	4841300	So to what extent do you say I gotta stay?
4841300	4844340	Not because I care about the institution itself per se,
4844340	4847700	but because anywhere else I went, right,
4847700	4849300	any other university would have some degree
4849300	4850220	of the same problems.
4850220	4851380	And the extent that it didn't,
4851380	4854100	I would say, well, I'm just replicating what's,
4854100	4855620	I mean, if there were a place
4855620	4857700	like the Stanford Business School,
4857700	4861100	which has created a vigorous classical liberalism series,
4861100	4862220	of course, it's in the business school,
4862220	4864420	not the film school,
4864420	4867460	you would say, well, the work's already been done here.
4867460	4869500	The problem, as I see it is,
4869500	4870900	the problem with you staying there,
4870900	4873740	it kind of legitimizes them when they don't deserve it.
4874940	4875780	Right?
4875780	4877500	I mean, have you thought about the idea that,
4877500	4879700	and I'm just totally tossing it out there,
4879700	4880780	like the University of Austin
4880780	4883060	is gonna do a debate and speaker series.
4883060	4884780	I think you'd be a fantastic person.
4884780	4887500	I think you could go on the road and debate this,
4887500	4890420	and I think you'd draw huge audiences.
4890420	4891660	Also though, keep in mind,
4891660	4894220	and you will know this too, from being in the classroom,
4894220	4895420	is there's a huge difference
4895420	4897660	between the students and the faculty.
4897660	4899220	Oh, absolutely, right, 100%.
4899220	4900860	Students, even the students
4900860	4904140	who ultimately are very woke, very left wing,
4904140	4905580	they're still curious.
4905580	4907020	They still wanna listen.
4907020	4908780	They still wanna hear from you.
4908780	4912060	They still wanna have a discussion after class.
4912060	4917060	They actually, so what is the experience
4918940	4921580	as a faculty member in an American woke University?
4921580	4925180	Well, it's true that your experience with your colleagues
4925180	4926380	is a big part of it,
4926380	4927860	because you're working together with them,
4927860	4929020	and they shape the environment,
4929020	4930940	and they pass resolutions against you.
4930940	4931780	But on the other hand,
4931780	4932620	your experience with the students
4932620	4936340	is also a big part of what you're living through,
4936340	4938460	and I love my students,
4938460	4940140	and I love being in the classroom with them,
4940140	4943380	and I find them very open-minded and curious
4943380	4945340	and interested to hear different perspectives.
4945340	4948980	And the fact that they would go to your class at all
4948980	4952340	would probably mean that either like you or they hate you,
4952340	4954020	but almost no one would have heard of it.
4954020	4955900	Right, they get to select, right?
4955900	4958620	So if they're really opposed, they just won't come,
4958620	4960340	but a lot of them do,
4960340	4963660	and the only problem students I ever have
4963660	4965580	are actually the graduate students
4965580	4969340	who have decided they're on the side of justice
4969340	4972100	and they're marching for the revolution.
4972100	4973740	I quote one of them in my book,
4973740	4976660	a guy who was going on to do a PhD
4976660	4979140	and was saying that I have to make clarifying remarks
4979140	4982820	in my letters that I in no way was in solidarity
4982820	4984540	with Dr. Gilley.
4984540	4987620	You can tell by the language where he was coming from,
4987620	4989060	but he's the outlier.
4989060	4993020	I mean, the students, which is ultimately, you know,
4994460	4996220	in terms of your daily experience,
4996220	4998420	shapes your daily experience,
4998420	4999700	I have no problem with my students,
4999700	5001420	and they have no problem with me.
5002700	5003660	So what's next for you?
5003660	5004660	What are you gonna do?
5005900	5007860	Well, I think partly we're all waiting to see
5007860	5010140	what happens to higher education in the next year.
5010140	5011580	Well, we know what's gonna happen.
5011580	5014020	Well, maybe we do, maybe we don't.
5014020	5018300	I think there has to be a reckoning,
5018340	5019940	especially now.
5019940	5023260	It's not just the Claudine Gay question
5023260	5027380	and the DEI bans that some states are passing.
5027380	5030980	And it's not also, it's not only the plagiarism questions.
5030980	5034100	And plagiarism, it's also the enrollment decline.
5034100	5038300	It's the demographic cusp, cliff.
5038300	5039700	They call it the demographic cliff
5039700	5041500	that they're all about to fall off.
5042700	5045180	It's the donors, it's the funding, right?
5045180	5046580	It's the college debt.
5046580	5048020	I mean, it's all of that,
5048020	5051540	which has to lead to some reformulation of the university.
5051540	5053700	And then the question is,
5053700	5056100	what's the business model going forward?
5056100	5060820	Because we know that universities thrive
5060820	5062340	when they get the best students, right?
5062340	5064420	Because universities are basically,
5065900	5068660	they live off their signaling, right?
5068660	5070860	The reason they hire great faculty
5070860	5073220	is not because those faculty know how to teach.
5074100	5075700	Often they're terrible teachers.
5076700	5079140	And the reason they love getting great students
5079140	5080860	is not necessarily because those students
5080860	5083220	are the most socially minded and positive,
5083220	5086700	but because everyone wants to go somewhere
5086700	5088420	where there's a bunch of smart people, right?
5088420	5090300	That's the university brand,
5090300	5093660	is we're taking you to a new level when you come here,
5093660	5096060	surrounded by smart people on campus
5096060	5097340	that you can learn from.
5097340	5100500	So to the extent that someone like Claudine,
5100500	5103020	think of the damage of a Claudine Gay case
5103020	5105180	against the Harvard brand, right?
5105180	5109140	Your president is not only academically incompetent
5109140	5111940	and administratively stupid, but she's a plagiarist, right?
5111940	5113100	11 citations.
5113100	5116460	Yeah, I mean, it's just amazing damage to the brand
5116460	5119740	in terms of what universities are supposed to offer to students.
5119740	5121420	And we're gonna keep wrong faculty.
5121420	5122540	Correct me if I'm wrong,
5122540	5125300	and I'm pretty sure this is the case, but I'm not positive.
5125300	5128420	I read the metrics of Portland State
5128420	5131340	accepts 98% of its applicants.
5131340	5134660	98%, so how intellectually rigorous could it possibly be
5134660	5136700	when they only reject 2%?
5136700	5139500	Like anyone with a pulse should be able to get in there.
5139500	5140980	Yeah, so admission is easy, right?
5140980	5143260	So you're talking about the bottom of the ladder.
5143260	5145740	The bottom of the bottom of the barrel.
5145740	5147660	Of course, you still have to pass classes, right?
5147660	5149540	You still have to succeed.
5149540	5151500	And there's some debate about
5151500	5153180	whether that's even very difficult anymore.
5153180	5156060	But as you move up in the ecosystem.
5156060	5157940	The average grade, I think in some places,
5157940	5159380	I remember I looked into this a while ago,
5159380	5163060	it's a, when I did my dissertation,
5163060	5167460	I think it was A minus in, I'm not sure,
5167460	5169940	but I think it's in the A minus is the average range.
5169940	5172620	It varies obviously by college and department.
5172620	5174300	Think philosophy is a little lower than that.
5174300	5177740	But so anybody, almost anybody can get in.
5177740	5179140	I wonder who those 2% are.
5179140	5181340	Like literally they must, I just can't even imagine.
5181340	5183660	And then once you get in, you kind of sail.
5183660	5186340	Like I think the average grade of Harvard now is an A.
5186340	5187940	So like once you get in, you're sailing.
5187940	5192260	But keep in mind what colleges and universities
5192260	5195260	should be judged upon is the value added.
5195260	5197420	They provide to students, right?
5197420	5200780	So last time I looked at the data
5200780	5203060	for a university like Portland State,
5203060	5205740	it was actually doing pretty good about average,
5205740	5207540	adding value to its students.
5207540	5209300	In other words, the SAT and then this.
5209300	5210820	Yeah, yeah, you look at their trajectory
5210820	5211900	coming out of high school.
5211900	5213140	Yeah, yeah.
5213140	5216100	And where a typical American will end up earning twice
5216100	5217740	with that kind of trajectory.
5217740	5221020	The universities can deflate it or inflate it, right?
5221020	5222860	If they add value, what they say is
5222860	5225460	they take someone who barely graduated high school,
5225460	5228820	has very little confidence in their intellectual abilities,
5228820	5230900	never really learn to write.
5230900	5232940	Portland State or a place like Portland State,
5232940	5236540	if they're doing a good job, takes them and says, look,
5236540	5239740	you can do this, you have an intellectual spark,
5239740	5241900	you need some confidence, you need some writing,
5241900	5243420	you need to be introduced to reading,
5243420	5245980	you need to be introduced to skill-based building.
5245980	5248260	And at the end of the day, you are on trajectory
5248260	5249940	to be below the poverty line.
5249940	5252220	You're now in the middle class, okay?
5252220	5253060	Whereas a Harvard-
5253060	5254140	That's good, that's a great accomplishment.
5254140	5257020	Yeah, whereas a Harvard might take a high flyer
5257020	5259860	who should have a mansion at Martha's Vineyard
5259860	5264660	and turn them into a down and out computer programmer
5264660	5269140	in Scranton, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
5269140	5271900	because they took away value
5271900	5274340	by telling them they should get involved in this
5274340	5276540	or saying skills don't matter or whatever.
5276540	5279140	So universities, of course,
5279140	5280380	they serve different populations.
5280380	5282980	The real metric of a university is the value added,
5282980	5285660	what they do to you compared to where you were heading
5285660	5286500	otherwise.
5286500	5287500	Yeah.
5287500	5289380	And I think, well, last time I checked,
5289380	5290900	Portland State was doing okay, but I mean,
5290900	5292300	that's the metric and like I say,
5292300	5295500	the liberal arts colleges are the worst in America
5295500	5297460	for value added because they detract value.
5297460	5299820	Yeah, that hurtens me because I, like you,
5299820	5300700	I love my students.
5300700	5303780	I thought the overwhelming majority were fantastic
5303780	5306620	and they were eager and they were thoughtful.
5306620	5308660	And yes, I definitely had students
5308660	5310700	and I'm not gonna downplay this.
5310700	5312220	You know, I don't know what percentage
5312220	5314260	who came in wanting to hate me for sure,
5314260	5315940	but they came in and they took the class
5315940	5317540	and my hats off to them.
5317540	5322460	And so my student experience was overwhelmingly positive
5322460	5324580	and so it's heartening to hear that.
5325980	5328340	Well, Bruce, you've been very generous with your time.
5328340	5330580	The case for colonialism.
5330580	5333020	I wish you seriously the best of luck,
5333020	5334540	not only in the sale of the book
5334540	5337220	and getting those ideas out there,
5337220	5340580	but I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.
5340580	5343540	I genuinely believe that the university
5343540	5344500	is not gonna do well,
5344500	5346700	but people like you will do extraordinarily well.
5346700	5347780	Thanks, it's been great to be here.
5347780	5348620	Yeah, my pleasure.
5348620	5349820	Thank you, Alex.
