1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Many words interpretation simply multiplies realities.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,160
We lose a special everything is true in the sense of all possible variations are true.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:22,240
So what I and in some sense what fascinates me the ontological incompleteness again disappears.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Everything is fully there. The problem is our limited standpoint.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,000
Am I missing something here?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,760
Yeah, so I'm happy about this one because you are missing something and I can I can help a little bit where I like you.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,880
Yeah, yeah.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:49,760
Hello, Maggie Slings. It is Mother Goose, Robinson Earhart, here with the podcast and the introduction to Robinson's podcast number 118,

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:57,920
which incidentally confirms that we are on a very strange branch of the wave function because my guests are

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,400
Slavoj Žižek and Sean Carroll and I will keep their bios short since everyone knows them.

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,400
But Slavoj is International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,360
and a senior researcher at the University of Ljubljana's Department of Philosophy.

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:28,640
He was also the guest on episode 109, which was all about psychoanalysis, wokeness, racism, sexism, Nazis,

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:37,360
curb your enthusiasm and 100 other things. It would be impossible to encapsulate all of the topics that we cover without

15
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,640
talking for the talking for 90 minutes, the length of our episode.

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,760
But Sean Carroll, on the other hand, is actually a quantum physicist. He is a cosmologist, a philosopher.

17
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:59,920
He's a homeward professor of natural philosophy at Johns Hopkins University and fractal faculty at the Santa Fe Institute.

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,000
He's also host of Sean Carroll's Minescape, which is an absolutely terrific show. I love it.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,520
I've listened to every episode on science, society, philosophy, culture, arts, ideas,

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,440
and anything else Sean has been thinking about. But Sean, along with David Albert of Columbia,

21
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,120
was a guest on episode 106, which covered the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics in great detail.

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:34,800
And then we also talked about entropy and the enduringly fascinating topic of Boltzmann brains and then the fine-tuned universe.

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:44,880
But in this episode, I am, as Slavoj refers to me, merely the middleman and a wallflower along with pins.

24
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,880
And so I don't do much of the talking. So Sean and Slavoj, while I giggle in the background,

25
00:02:52,880 --> 00:03:01,280
do talk about quantum mechanics, the indeterminacy of small scale reality, cosmology and the Big Bang,

26
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:09,200
some major figures like Niels Bohr, Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and then the world of sci-fi,

27
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,560
including movies like everything, everywhere, all at once, Indiana Jones and the Avengers.

28
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,760
And now one thing that I really have to mention, so pay attention now, is that Sean Carroll is an

29
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,160
honorary fellow of the John Bell Institute for the Foundations of Physics, which is directed by

30
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:36,480
another Robinson's podcast alumnus, and that is Tim Modlin of NYU. It's, at this point,

31
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:44,480
still very much a nascent organization trying to secure its home. And it is meant to give a home to

32
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,960
many of the topics that we discussed today and really has the who's who in the foundations of physics

33
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:57,280
as contributors. And the JBI can really use any donations at this point in their early history.

34
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,360
I've donated once and will certainly donate again as soon as my meager budget allows it.

35
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,840
So anything you contribute will be greatly appreciated by the JBI. And finally, there are

36
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,840
links to Sean's website, Sean's Twitter, and the biggest ideas in the universe in the description.

37
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,840
So without any further ado, I hope you enjoy this wide-ranging conversation as much as I

38
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,240
didn't so much have it, but got to enjoy listening to it as it happened myself.

39
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:47,120
Slavoj, you're very well known for thinking about a lot of topics and Marxism, psychoanalysis,

40
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,960
and Hegel come to mind, but quantum physics isn't one of them. So just to get us started,

41
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,960
when did Q.M. and the various quantum theories catch your philosophical interest to the point

42
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,800
that you've been concertedly writing and thinking about it a lot more lately?

43
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:15,840
My, it's quite a series of topics. The first one is my philosophical obsession. I've written

44
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,800
about it repeatedly and so on. And Sean, this is already to provoke you interrupt me at any point.

45
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:32,240
What absolutely fascinates me in quantum physics is, again, maybe it's already wrong,

46
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:40,400
I will say, this idea of to put it in philosophical terms, ontological incompleteness.

47
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,960
For example, the point is not we cannot measure, at the same time, position and movement.

48
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,960
That's for me not radical enough. It still means the particle has a measure in the position, we

49
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:04,080
just can't, movement and position, we just can't measure it. But what if in more radical reading,

50
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:13,600
reality is in itself ontologically incomplete? The point is not that if you analyze reality to the

51
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:21,680
end, you will get a complete, a complete description with everything at its place and so on and so

52
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:33,600
on. And as far as I can see, now you will ask me, how does this link with my philosophy? Because

53
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:46,080
it's a very unorthodox reading. In my reading, even of Shegel, the final result is not you get

54
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:55,440
the whole truth. The final result is that what you thought was just an epistemological obstacle,

55
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,800
like we cannot get it all, just one aspect of the other. The final result is when you realize that

56
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:10,480
what appeared to you as a limitation of your knowledge is, defines already the reality itself.

57
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:20,480
Reality is in itself incomplete. Now I follow debates and I know the problems with this. If she

58
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:30,640
known in the United States, she being Sabine Hosenfelder, the German one, her idea is, I'm sure

59
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:38,480
you know a thousand times better than me, is a super big feminism. And basically,

60
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,600
her idea is, if I follow it correctly, on Einstein's line, she had variables and so on,

61
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:55,280
we just don't know it all. Where I see an interesting point that she makes is, and now comes

62
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:08,480
Sean, my first question to you. Some physicists, one to which who I spoke, not as highly graded as you,

63
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:19,200
insisted that all this focus on not the agent, what triggers the so-called collapse of the wave

64
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:27,280
function, that is a secondary, unimportant problem, that you can even, this is the radical

65
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:37,520
tendency, if I got it correctly, that you can define collapse even in an objective way. What

66
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:47,680
comes to my mind are so-called decoherence theories, or another version is a quantity that as soon as

67
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:55,360
the object is no longer at the subparticle level, but becomes part of our reality,

68
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,280
automatically decoherence happens. Now, this brings me to another point, I hope we will

69
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:12,560
have time later to approach it, which is time and space. Do you agree, because I was informed that

70
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:20,960
this is also one of your topics? Is it true or not that this hidden variable's Einstein view

71
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,960
is more focused on space as a more primary dimension? Didn't Einstein even at some point

72
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:38,800
propose the theory that what we perceive as time, time movement, is really just moving along a certain

73
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,000
spatial line and so on? On the other hand, there are many others, and for obvious reasons, it's

74
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:56,960
closer to me, who claim that time is more radical, primordial, but let's begin with this, with what

75
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:04,160
I told you. All this problem, and I know that- I think so, yeah. Collapse of wave function,

76
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:11,760
observer, registration, when does it happen? Because I find all different versions, up to the

77
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,560
cosmological one, that it's God himself, who is the ultimate observer, no reality without God,

78
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:28,480
and to this more modest version, whatever, okay, teach me, where I'm totally losing my mind,

79
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,200
and tell me at least the state of the things today. I think this is very good, because the time and

80
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,280
space questions that you're raising are very, very good, but they come later, so the quantum mechanics

81
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:47,120
collapse of the wave function questions come first, and to me, it's extremely embarrassing,

82
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,680
but true, that physicists don't know what to think about exactly the questions that you are raising.

83
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,200
So let me just quickly run through some of the options, because there are sensible people who

84
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,640
believe all of them. You know, the fundamental fact that we're trying to

85
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:11,520
accommodate ourselves to is that we have a way of describing the world that is super duper successful

86
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,280
with what we call a wave function, the quantum state, the Schrodinger equation, all this mathematical

87
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,120
apparatus, but then when we look at it, when we measure it, when we perceive it or experience it,

88
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:31,040
we don't see that wave function. We see a position or a momentum, some observable quantity,

89
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,720
and this is completely... Which is absolutely not reality, what we see always.

90
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,880
Well, we... Yes, I don't want to prejudice by deciding what's ordinary reality yet, but we see

91
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,600
things, and the things we see, I think what you're getting at is they do remind us of what we thought

92
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,480
the universe was back in the days of classical mechanics. Newton would have said that there is

93
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,920
a position, there is a velocity, now we say, well, we observe those, but that's not how we discuss

94
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,640
what's really going on. So I can quickly run through at least three options that are very

95
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:10,960
much on the table. There is a very conservative way of going where you say there really are

96
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,600
positions and velocities, those are real things, and there is also something called the wave function,

97
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,560
and it's a whole big complicated mess, and that is the hidden variables approach that,

98
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,640
like you say, Einstein would have liked. There are still people who follow that, mostly in the

99
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,080
context of what is called Bohmian mechanics. You have both a wave function and articles.

100
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:41,440
That's what I wanted to say. How could these pilot waves... Isn't this still...

101
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:49,360
There are the substantial entity particles or whatever, and you just accompany them as a

102
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,680
capable aura with wave functions, you know? You know, I have to be honest, I'm not sympathetic

103
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:02,560
to this point of view, so I have trouble defending it. For purely philosophical reasons, I'm not

104
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:10,480
sympathetic, but let me now directly move to the third degree, but my KGB file on you

105
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,560
tells me that you are sympathetic to many worlds. Reading. That's going to be the third of the three

106
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,800
options I give you. Sorry, sorry, go on. Yes, sorry. Yes, one is hidden variables, just like you said.

107
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,320
The second is more or less what you were pointing to yourself at the beginning there, which is the

108
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:37,360
most radical one, which is essentially to deny the existence of reality, or at least to deny the

109
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,480
existence of something that is mathematically precise and that pre-exists our observations,

110
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,560
to make this incredibly radical move that says that we can calculate the probability of what our

111
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,000
observations will be, and we can then make them, and when we see them they're real,

112
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,760
but there was no such thing as what they were before we observed them. There was only this

113
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,920
instrumentalist kind of calculation, and weirdly, even though that is clearly the most radical and

114
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,720
hard to really wrap your brain around, that's the one that came first. That's the more or less

115
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,400
what Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg would have advocated, you know, a completely epistemic

116
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:28,560
instrumental approach to thinking about quantum mechanics. Whereas the third option I would give

117
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:36,160
you is a happy medium, where you say there's the wave function, and that's it. There is nothing else,

118
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,840
and the wave function does not collapse, and there are no extra variables, and the Schrodinger

119
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,200
equation, which tells you how the wave function evolves, is always true, just like Newton's laws

120
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:53,600
were always true in classical mechanics. And the crucially important thing to make that viable

121
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,440
is because when we look at things, like I said, we don't see the wave function, so if it's what is

122
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,720
real, why don't we see it? And the answer is that we have a wave function ourselves, and we have

123
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,840
superpositions of who we are, and they all exist, but the we that does the observing and the

124
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:20,240
experiencing is only a tiny, tiny fraction of what is going on in the whole wave function,

125
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:28,320
so we call this many worlds. And it is on the one hand the most simple and straightforward working

126
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,720
version of quantum mechanics. On the other hand, it makes you a little bit dizzy to think that all

127
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,560
these different worlds are coming into being. And I would put super determinism and Sabina's

128
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,960
theories, which come from other people also, as a fourth category, which is even wackier

129
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,840
than the ones that I've told you about, but we can talk about them if you want.

130
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:54,720
Yeah. Thanks very much. Listen to me. Okay. My first story to go on in this police

131
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:05,440
style, my problem is the standard reproach that I hear and read about many worlds is that

132
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:15,280
it's one cannot even imagine how to test it with today's knowledge. That it's just an empty

133
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:24,800
hypothesis. It resolves such many paradoxes, blah, blah. But with today's knowledge, we cannot get a

134
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:34,400
clear test. Good. That's wrong. But you do hear it a lot. Yeah. Please. Go on. I'm sorry. It depends

135
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,440
on what you mean by test and we have to get very carefully into the philosophy of science here,

136
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:49,200
right? For two reasons. If what you mean by test is just the very naive falsifiability kind of

137
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,320
idea that Karl Popper would have put forward, right? Can you rule out the theory by doing some

138
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,720
experiment? Then the answer is clearly and straightforwardly yes, because the theory just

139
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,680
says that there is a wave function and all it ever does is obey this particular equation.

140
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,520
So if you ever see the wave function not obeying that equation, you have ruled out the theory. You

141
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,200
have falsified it. And there are I didn't mention, but there are other versions of quantum mechanics

142
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:25,280
that predict exactly that in a very quantitative and testable way. So far, what we call the objective

143
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,520
collapse of the wave function has not been observed in experiment. But as soon as we do

144
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,120
observe it, if that ever happens, we will rule out many worlds. Sorry to interrupt,

145
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,680
but when you say has not been observed, so you don't buy this simplistic materialist,

146
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:50,000
I also don't buy it version, which says that no problem collects happens all the time in

147
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,400
reality and so on. And you try to define registration or decoherence in a totally

148
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:03,280
objective way. You don't buy this. Well, I am super duper materialist. But I think that the

149
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,080
only thing the wave function ever does is obey the Schrodinger equation. It does not collapse

150
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,800
all by itself. So the alternatives, there are there's sort of sub degrees within this materialist,

151
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,720
physicalist camp. People like me think it's the Schrodinger equation from start to finish.

152
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,000
And what we perceive as collapses are only apparent, because we're not seeing the whole

153
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,440
story. There are other people like Roger Penrose or others who think that the wave function

154
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,760
violates the Schrodinger equation by suddenly collapsing on itself. I think it's very, very

155
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,880
difficult to actually define a theory that works along those lines, but it does have the

156
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,680
nice quality that it's very, very testable, and it's very, very different in its predictions

157
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:55,760
from what many worlds is. Okay, now there's the other- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please. I will

158
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,160
discipline myself. Finish, please. There's the other even more subtle philosophy of science

159
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,560
question, which is, okay, but what about many worlds versus the Copenhagen interpretation or

160
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,400
Bohmian mechanics or something like that? And these are all very tricky, worthwhile asking

161
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:20,320
questions. My answer is the following. The problem with Copenhagen versus many worlds is that Copenhagen

162
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,800
is not a theory. It is not precise. It does not tell you when wave functions collapse,

163
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:33,200
what a measurement is, what qualifies as a measuring apparatus. It's not that I can't test

164
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:40,640
it. It doesn't even tell me what the predictions are or what the ontology is. So if you're comparing

165
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,280
many worlds to Copenhagen, it's not a fair fight because one theory is well-defined and the other

166
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,600
one isn't. It is true that as far as I know, they have no difference in terms of experimental

167
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,840
predictions, but they have huge differences in terms of being well-defined. Whereas with

168
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,160
pi-the-wave theories, Bohmian mechanics, hidden variable theories, those are well-defined.

169
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:11,680
I would like to be able to distinguish many worlds from them. I have a deep suspicion that

170
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:18,320
they are experimentally distinguishable, but nobody has actually pinpointed what that difference is.

171
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,960
So that is, to me, an open question. I think that there's a lot of Bohmians who think that

172
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,440
their predictions are exactly the same as many worlds. I suspect they've not just been trying

173
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:35,200
hard enough. Okay, now I will try to be more precise. I agree with you. There isn't even one

174
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,120
about Niels Bohr. There is even one very vicious, but I like vicious,

175
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:50,720
formulation's point that it repeats almost that the basic formula of Copenhagen interpretation is

176
00:20:50,720 --> 00:21:01,280
don't think just calculate. Don't even ask these questions. Okay, let me go step by step. My

177
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:10,960
problem with many worlds is that the way you put it, I would love this. The only wave oscillations

178
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,680
collapse is something that appears, blah blah blah, but isn't in some sense, although

179
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,400
when I say in some sense, I don't mean it in a precise scientific sense, but it seems to me that

180
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:34,160
many worlds interpretation simply multiplies realities. We lose a special, everything is true

181
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:42,080
in the sense of all possible variations are true. So what I, and in some sense,

182
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:50,880
what fascinates me, the ontological incompleteness, again disappears. Everything is fully there.

183
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:58,080
The problem is our limited standpoint. Am I missing something here?

184
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,680
Yeah, so I'm happy about this one because you are missing something and I can, I can, I can help a

185
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:09,920
little bit. I like you. Yeah, yeah. So two, again, two points worth making. One is that

186
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:18,560
it is certainly not true that within many worlds, every possibility exists. It's very easy to

187
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:24,080
to point to possible worlds that don't come into existence. What, what many world says after all is

188
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,160
that we obey the Schrodinger equation. And that implies a lot. For example, electric charge is

189
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:37,120
conserved. I can imagine a world where a proton spontaneously turns into an electron. There is

190
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,920
no such world in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. There are many, many

191
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:49,120
imaginable worlds that just don't come to be. The second issue, which is much more subtle and

192
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,800
worth, you know, you're allowed to disagree with many worlds on this one is many worlds not only

193
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:02,800
says here's the bunch of worlds. It says that the worlds don't count equally. That there is a weight

194
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,480
or a thickness to them. And that helps explain why in quantum mechanics,

195
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,640
you predict there's a probability for X or a probability for Y, but the probability for X

196
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:20,320
is 99%. And the probability for Y is 1%. And that's a crucially important part of many worlds

197
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,440
that you don't necessarily get if you're just thinking about David Lewis and possible worlds

198
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,040
or something like that, right? Many worlds on defies how big the worlds are. And that's crucially

199
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:38,160
important. But now I would like my police instinct to gain kind comes into action.

200
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:46,640
When you say how big worlds are, is this ontological category in the sense that some

201
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:54,000
worlds are sorry to use this term, you can explode in some sense more substantially real

202
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,560
than others? Or can you specify a little bit more, this idea of more and less,

203
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:10,720
whichever way you name it, big or strong worlds? Well, you know, and I do say the

204
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,600
following thing often and always makes me feel bad. But this is something where if we write down

205
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,480
the equations, it's crystal clear. In words, it's hard. But the answer is that it's not that one

206
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,560
world is more real than another. They're both real. Let's let's get take the 99% versus 1%

207
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:35,680
example. They're both real. But the way it works out is if you don't know the outcome of the

208
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,000
experiment, so you do the experiment, you make the observation and you haven't looked yet.

209
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:50,000
So maybe you're in the 99% world, maybe you're in the 1% world, right? The impact of this

210
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,240
calculation, which is completely quantitative, is that you should assign a credence of 0.99

211
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,000
to being in the 99% world and a credence of 0.01 to being in the 1% world.

212
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So they're both real, but you're not equally likely to find yourself in them.

213
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:14,800
What I still don't get and sorry, I, although I'm totally opposed like you to that

214
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:22,560
hidden variables in the sense of there is one single substantial reality, that's what I still

215
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:36,160
don't get here. Okay, Schrodinger equation said 99% blah blah. Then I agree with you because of our

216
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:46,000
limited standpoint, something happens. Why insist that parallel or I don't like the word

217
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:56,560
parallel is too physical, that at the same time, another reality exists, alternate. What do you,

218
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:03,680
what do you gain by this? Nobody wants this to be the case. Nobody is insisting that both

219
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:09,120
worlds are there. That is the prediction of the Schrodinger equation. And the question is,

220
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:16,000
you can either accept it, like I think of what Hugh Everett did as more therapeutic. He was a

221
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,800
joclican of physics. He wasn't writing down new equations. He was just saying, here are the equations,

222
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:30,880
here are their implications, you have to deal with it. Or you can modify the theory, you can do

223
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,800
violence to the Schrodinger equation to get rid of the other world if that makes you feel better.

224
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,360
And you're welcome to try to do that. That's basically what the hidden variables people

225
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,560
are trying to do. They're trying to invent a finger that points to one world and says,

226
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,960
here's the one we're actually in. The others are there, but there's only one that we're actually

227
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,840
in. That's why David Deutsch, for example, says that hidden variable peoples are just

228
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,480
many world's people in denial, because they know the other worlds are there, they don't want to

229
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:09,920
live in that. I like the Hegel formulations, because back to, okay, back to the opposite vision,

230
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:19,760
back to Niels Bohr. I was surprised at how, at some level, he is ultra commonsense,

231
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:27,360
really. Doesn't he repeatedly say, all that we can observe, all that exists out there is our

232
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:34,320
common reality. Everything that we measure, it shows on the screen, we're measuring apparatus in

233
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:41,760
our common reality. So, he insists that all these wave function formulas and so on, they have no

234
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:49,040
ontological status in the sense that we have to presuppose another type of reality.

235
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:56,240
He insists that it's simply, and here he escapes, I think, too easily into some kind of

236
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,360
naive epistemological reason. He says, these are just our mathematical means, formulas, or sometimes

237
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:12,320
he even says language symbolic fictions to account for how did we come from A to B, but both A and

238
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:23,200
B are firmly here. So, does he ever try to make a step further? I know I will be very precise here,

239
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,880
I'm not, I'm laughing, but not substantially, because what would then in this view prove,

240
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:37,440
I, of course, follow this with fascination, the, these years you remember the three guys,

241
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:46,160
the old French one, Alain Aspect, and the Zeilinger, an Austrian man, and the third one is American,

242
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:55,920
I think, or whatever, no. What did they really prove? Isn't, nonetheless, in what they say,

243
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:04,320
a little bit more realist tendency, that in some sense, there must be a level of

244
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:13,760
reality, which work reality, whatever you call it out there, that works in a different way from our

245
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:23,680
ordinary reality. Another thing, usually what they did is, with these experiments, is usually read as

246
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:34,480
Bol's victory against Einstein. But isn't it more complex, because they didn't prove that there is no,

247
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:43,680
that there is pure contingency, no. They only proved that if you go to Particle A, this then the

248
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:51,440
correlated Particle B down up, but this only means that there is no link at the level of speed of

249
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:58,640
light or lower. There still can be a link at the higher level, higher, okay, outside, no?

250
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,840
Exactly, that's exactly right. Bohr has his, you know, I don't read a lot of Niels Bohr,

251
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,600
he's famously hard to understand, but he has his modern avatars, right, there are people alive right

252
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:18,880
now, who very much think that reality does not pre-exist our measurement outcomes. And as you

253
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,240
imply, Einstein, as well as Schrodinger for that matter, were very much on the other side. They

254
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:31,040
were very much physicalists, materialists, they wanted to see the mechanisms behind what was

255
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:38,160
going on before we made our observations. The problem that they had, as you're pointing to, is that

256
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:45,760
they had a, you know, Einstein invented relativity. He thought that spacetime was very fundamental

257
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,560
and the speed of light was absolute. So what he pointed out in the famous EPR paper, Einstein,

258
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:59,440
Podolsky and Rosen, is that quantum mechanics, but maybe the audience doesn't, so I'm trying to be

259
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:08,560
careful. You know, quantum mechanics seems, he said, to be incomplete with any kind of underlying

260
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:14,640
theory that would take locality seriously, the idea that not only is there space and time,

261
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:21,360
but things that exist have locations in space and time and things that interact

262
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,640
do so at the same point of space and time. And Einstein says quantum mechanics seems to be

263
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:34,880
incompatible with that. And John Bell proved a theorem saying, yes, it truly is incompatible

264
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,920
with that. And then the people who measured their correlated photons, their entangled photons,

265
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:51,200
Ospey, Klauser and Zeilinger, verified that Bell was correct, that you cannot reproduce the

266
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,640
predictions that we observe in the real world with any naively locally realist theory.

267
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,400
But only locally, no? Only locally. It must be locally.

268
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:08,560
Only locally, exactly. So even the, amusingly, even the Nobel Committee got this wrong in their

269
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,520
press release. They said that these experiments ruled out hidden variable theories, but that's

270
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,960
just false. They ruled out local hidden variable theories. Because this was my first reaction.

271
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,240
Sorry, it doesn't rule out all hidden variables, just those operating locally.

272
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:33,600
In fact, just to, you know, make the story more amusing, John Bell was motivated by the fact that

273
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,960
David Bohm had written down a non-local hidden variable theory that was very successful. And

274
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,120
Bell really liked Bohm's theory, and he asked himself, is it, you know, Bohm's theory is clearly

275
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,520
manifestly non-local? Is that a necessary quality, or can we get rid of it? And what you proved is,

276
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,640
you cannot get rid of it. It's necessary if you want to match the data.

277
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:06,400
But again, here, first, sorry, let me return for a brief moment to Neil's board. I hope we

278
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:12,800
are both here on the materialist side in the sense that what I worry is not so much this

279
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:21,120
direct new age spiritual reappropriation if I were to be a ruler of a Stalinist empire.

280
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,360
If you say, as I read somewhere, some Indian idiot, not Native American, India said,

281
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,360
oh, but all the Xilinger and those guys proved is not we Indians know from Upanishads, from

282
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,280
Bhagavad, you know all that bullshit. Even the movie, I haven't seen it, but it didn't prevent me to

283
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:46,080
write the review of it. Oppenheimer goes into this, you know, all those voting Bhagavad Gita,

284
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:54,000
and the destroyer of the world, whatever. So even, even the board was not clear here.

285
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,200
When he, when he, what's his principle? Sorry, I'm so confused now of

286
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:12,320
complementarity, yeah? He had this tendency to falsely universalize it in a pseudo-spiritualist

287
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,760
way. For example, he said, it's not just particles, it's also, he said, to the Bible,

288
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:26,720
then, then wisdom versus knowledge and all that bullshit and so on. So this is where we need,

289
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:34,160
we materialists, intellectual police, no? We need some agency to say the moment you mention this,

290
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:39,200
do you know what I give you here, one-way ticket, first class to Bulak for 10 years,

291
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:46,800
no, but seriously, isn't this, that's why also quantum, why quantum physics interests me,

292
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:54,640
because precisely because it breaks the confines of our ordinary notion of reality,

293
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:02,880
it is always exposed to this pseudo-spiritualist danger. So my,

294
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:12,800
my problem here is, I read this and I learn also from people like you that,

295
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:20,960
that golden era of Copenhagen shut up, daunting, calculate is over. We are returning to what

296
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:29,440
traditionally is called ontological, metaphysical questions. My temptation is, and please tell

297
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:38,960
me from what you know, am I totally wrong or not? If I, you know what vacillates me in this

298
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:49,120
Bell's theorem, no? What if this element of maybe even contingency is not the right term, just this

299
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:57,840
openness, not full determinism and so on, are we back with many worlds in

300
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:05,920
determinism or do, is this openness of the universe maintained? Wonderful idea for me that

301
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,800
you know, even if you look at details, details, no, it's not. You discover deep at some point,

302
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,200
reality is blank, open. I would like as a philosopher for non-scientific interest to

303
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,200
save this, hit me. I mean, with counter. I think that two things, you know, your, your,

304
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:32,720
your characterization of Bohr is right on. Not only was his philosophy of quantum mechanics

305
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,560
a little bit fuzzy, with not defining what he meant by measurement and whatever, but he did,

306
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:48,240
you know, unabashedly connected to ideas from ancient eastern wisdom and complementarity.

307
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,920
And you were doing this, I thought you were trying to only come in him. Even eastern wisdom,

308
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,800
he was already dead. Oh, yes. Oh, my God. He was. And not to anyone's benefit.

309
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,520
But out of police when we take power. Right. But the determinism question is a much trickier one,

310
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,400
because then, I mean, just so everyone knows in the background here, so, you know, quantum

311
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,880
mechanics came on the scene in the 1920s and 30s with the Copenhagen interpretation and whatever.

312
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:21,760
It was in the 1950s that people like Bohm and Everett finally wrote down 100% physical

313
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:27,600
material versions of quantum mechanics that fit the data completely well. The physics community

314
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,680
could not care less. They just ignored it. They go on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you care about this,

315
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,000
you're not going to get a job. You'll be kicked out of the field. But we know. You can't now say.

316
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,600
Bohm also a political one. He was very left leaning with. That's right. He was kicked out of the

317
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,000
country, not only of the field. Ever left the field by himself. But he picked out a few different

318
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,320
reasons. Yeah. Not because of quantum mechanics. No, no, because of his point. Yeah. But, you know,

319
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:01,840
yeah, so there's there and there are still people today who will, who will be, are you in favor

320
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:08,960
of idealism on the basis of quantum mechanics that we have to put consciousness. Sorry.

321
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,760
It should be. Isn't sorry for Roger Penrose approaching death a little bit.

322
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,480
Maybe a little bit. A little bit. But at least, yeah. But I think, you know, there are some people

323
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,000
who will simply deny the existence of objective reality and put mind and agents at the center of

324
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,960
everything. That's one thing. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe that's right. Maybe it's wrong. But my point is,

325
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,800
quantum mechanics doesn't force you in that direction. There's perfectly mechanistic versions

326
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:43,760
that fit the data perfectly well. But so, so again, your answer to this mega reproach from Einstein,

327
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:52,000
Janssen, Savine, Rosenfelder, and so on, that quantum mechanics describes, it's very simple

328
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,880
reproach. I just repeated for the viewers, describes a certain universe, which is in itself

329
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:07,520
consistent wave function, blah, blah. But it cannot account in its own terms of the,

330
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:15,760
our ordinary reality measuring, and so on, and so on. In, if I read you correctly,

331
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,880
many worlds does this in some sense. Yes. Yeah, exactly. So I think, you know, I forgot, you

332
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,520
also mentioned determinism, which is a crucial point here, which again, physicists don't agree on.

333
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:36,800
So for both hidden variable theories, boom, by the waves, etc., and for many worlds, you're in a

334
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:45,040
situation where the underlying equations and dynamics are 100% deterministic. Laplace would

335
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,240
have been happy. Laplace's demon could predict everything that happens. But in both theories,

336
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,240
there is some epistemic uncertainty. There is some subjective probability that comes in.

337
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,000
In the case of hidden variables, it's because you don't know where the hidden variables are.

338
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,720
In the case of many worlds, it's because all these different branches exist, and you don't

339
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:12,320
know which branch you are on. So there's the appearance of indeterminism, because you cannot,

340
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,360
even if you know the wave function of the universe perfectly, you still can't predict the outcomes

341
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,480
of your next experiment. So it's a weird in-between ground. You know what I would like to do? Now,

342
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:33,200
this is a pure abstract, in a bad sense, philosopher speaking through me now. I would just like to

343
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:42,000
elevate into, as you may have guessed, into ontological status to put into reality itself

344
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,320
this element of uncertainty. Can't we say, while keeping sure the equation and so on that,

345
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:55,840
and that's for me the mega greatness of quantum physics, that there is an element of uncertainty

346
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:04,320
which is not just epistemological, but which is in itself. Isn't this also implied in what you said,

347
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:14,400
99%, 1%, it's not that we don't know. It's in reality itself, in some sense, because it's

348
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:24,880
99%, 1%, and so on. You don't like this idea. Yeah, I am honestly, I know that you told me to just

349
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,000
say the truth and not say that I'm not sure about my opinions being true or false. This is a good area

350
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,440
where it's okay to be a little uncertain. I would say that in the many worlds point of view,

351
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:46,720
we're faced with a novel, unique metaphysical challenge, because like I said, we can know

352
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:52,560
everything about the universe and still not make a prediction. And the reason why is because

353
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:59,440
that 99% world and the 1% world are both going to become true. And there will be a

354
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:07,680
future version of me in each of those worlds. And there's no unique, it's not even sensible to ask

355
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,480
which one of them am I going to be. They're both going to be in there in existence. They're both

356
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,160
going to have all of my memories, right? This is utterly unprecedented in physics or philosophy.

357
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:24,320
So I claim that the way to distinguish it is to say that both of those future selves are real

358
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:30,080
people, but they're in positions of self locating uncertainty, indexical uncertainty. There's

359
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,600
something they don't know, which is where they are in the universe, which branch of the wave

360
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:44,000
function they're on. And it's perfectly deterministic, underlying dynamics, but a new situation in

361
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,440
which there's no univalent you that can ask questions about the universe. There's many

362
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:58,160
different future versions of you. This nonetheless reminds me of problems that emerge even with

363
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:06,240
Descartes, Kogito in modern philosophy, where here I see the actuality of Descartes. Yes,

364
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:13,840
universe is mechanistic and so on, but I cannot locate myself into it deterministically.

365
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:21,600
This is the big enigma, I think, in some sense of the entire modern philosophy.

366
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,520
I recently did a podcast with Robinson, with David Albert, who is another very well-accomplished

367
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,040
philosopher of science. And we talked about the fact that there is an analogous situation

368
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:39,920
that also comes up with the multiverse, not the many worlds of quantum mechanics, but the

369
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,960
cosmological multiverse, where we imagine that just very, very far away, there's many different

370
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,880
observers and so forth. And philosophy is just not currently up to the task of dealing with this,

371
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,440
I think. It needs to get better, but how do you evaluate questions like,

372
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,000
what would a typical observer see in this ensemble? And should I care about that question,

373
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,440
because I am not a typical observer. Should I reason as if I were typical? Cosmologists

374
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,200
bless their hearts. They think the right thing to do is to reason as if they were a typical

375
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,640
observer in the universe, even though they know perfectly well that they're not. So they go through

376
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,760
this weird thing where they say, okay, I'm going to forget everything I know about my actual situation.

377
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,640
I'm going to pretend I was a typical observer. I'm going to make predictions. I'm going to open

378
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,640
my eyes and go, oh, this is very surprising. But we can do better than that and we don't do yet.

379
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,400
But you see, now we don't have time to go into it, but this is another

380
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:50,400
metaphysical topic that fascinates me. Why? And often, for me, deterministic philosophers get

381
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:57,360
caught into this. You want to be as realistic as possible, but to formulate your position,

382
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:03,760
you have to pause at an impossible point of subjectivity, where you see an all-universal

383
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:10,400
observer and so on and so on. What tempts me, but I don't have, of course, not a scientific

384
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:21,920
formula here, is, but okay, let's return to many worlds. But you think that, but doesn't

385
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,760
Schrodinger equation, equation, just give probabilities from what will happen now,

386
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,720
like 99% this happens, okay, everything happens. I got your point.

387
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:41,520
Yeah, so not everything happens, but something's happened and something's happened more than others.

388
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:47,440
So, you know, I think that this is the challenge, because if you're a many worlds person,

389
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,360
you do think that the Schrodinger equation is all there is. And let me back up just a second

390
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,640
to make it even a little bit more reasonable. If you believe in quantum mechanics at all,

391
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:05,680
and you want to be realist at all, right, so then you will have to say that the electron

392
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,720
that can be spinning clockwise or spinning counterclockwise, quantum mechanics says it

393
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:17,040
could be in a superposition, right? It truly is some combination of spinning clockwise and

394
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,320
spinning counterclockwise. And so if you believe that that can be physically true, not just a

395
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:27,840
state of our knowledge or prediction, then you should be able to believe that the whole universe

396
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:34,320
can be in a superposition of many different possibilities. So you're not asking for anything

397
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:40,480
more by becoming a many worlds person, all the possibilities were always there in the

398
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:48,320
quantum mechanics. All of the new challenges are philosophical. How do I deal with the fact

399
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:53,360
that there are many people like me with exactly the same epistemic states? How do I make predictions

400
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,440
of what they're going to see when they open their eyes and things like that? It is a radically

401
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,040
different view of the world, maybe not as radical as the view that says that there is no reality,

402
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,880
but still pretty darn radical. And I think the quantum mechanics forces us to be radical one

403
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:17,840
way or another. I see, I see. Okay, let me move it connect. You know what fascinates me? Now I move

404
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:28,080
into my own speculations about philosophy language and so on. I like so much the notion of superposition

405
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,720
because I think I will try to put it in very simple terms, but it's a more complex theory.

406
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:43,600
A guy who teaches French guy who I think, is he Stanford or Santa Cruz? Did you hear the name

407
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:49,680
Jean Pierre Dupuis, D-U-P-U-Y, a French theory. A very familiar but not an expert, yes.

408
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:02,080
Tried to introduce, but without any bluffing about quantum physics, the notion of superposition

409
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:12,320
into historical processes and knowledges. I will give you an extremely simplified example.

410
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:20,880
Let's say today we are in an, I will go even specifically, Russia put in Ukraine war.

411
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:30,080
Again, maybe it's already decided in the terms of the Schrodinger equation 99%, but we don't

412
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:37,680
know what, that there will be global war or not. But his idea is this one. And again, this is pure

413
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:47,440
speculation, more pertaining to human language. Is that in our human, human universe, I'm here

414
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,760
often referred maybe to that famous quote from T.S. Eliot, who was an idealist conservative, but

415
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:04,080
others, he put it nicely that every new invention, really new in art, in some sense also changes the

416
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:11,760
entire past. It makes it readable in a different way. So Dupuis interpretation against these lines

417
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:21,360
would be, let's say that in two, three years, there will be world war three. Then automatically,

418
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:28,560
we will retroactively read it as it was clear all the time that this should happen. We just

419
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:37,360
had illusions that we can avoid it. Let's say that world war three will not happen. Then we will

420
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:46,080
have the way we read today, the Cold War. No, yes, it was danger, but somehow we avoided it and so

421
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:53,440
on and so on. But Dupuis point that I like is that it's not enough to say that these were just

422
00:49:53,440 --> 00:50:02,320
different possibilities, options. It's a stronger term. It's in the sense that if something happens,

423
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:11,280
it, of course, it doesn't restructure the past in its brutal reality. But the whole symbolic

424
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:17,680
constellation of how we read the past page. And this now I could go on here for hours. I love

425
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:24,960
these examples. That's why I am not, and I think in my crazy way, I got this lesson from one of

426
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:37,440
these mechanics. I am not, I totally reject this stupid historicist view to understand Shakespeare.

427
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:46,640
You must study in detail Elizabethan era and so on. I would say first the opposite. To understand

428
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:56,400
Elizabethan era rejects, you will learn more. But more seriously, you know, for me, really great works

429
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:05,760
of art are precisely the ones which cannot be limited to a specific historical constellation.

430
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:13,440
Every new epoch reinvents them. For example, with Shakespeare. Many people don't know, but immediately

431
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:20,560
after his death, it was the horrible era of Racine and all those strange guys, classicists, and

432
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:26,560
Shakespeare was considered vulgar. Only through romanticism, Shakespeare was reinvented. And I

433
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:38,000
love these paradoxes. How sometimes precisely not knowing all the context of Shakespeare historical,

434
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,760
you can propose a reading which is much more convincing. And it's not simply an external

435
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,520
reading. Again, I'm back to my point about openness. It is as if, which is obvious,

436
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:58,560
Shakespeare didn't really know what he is doing. You know, which is here my wonderful example. You

437
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:04,960
know that it's attributed to Lincoln, but I read somewhere that he was not really the first to

438
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,600
say that, you know, you can treat some of the people all the time, all the people

439
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:17,120
sometime, but you cannot treat all the people all of the time. This is a deeply ambiguous statement.

440
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:26,080
It can mean there are some idiots who can be treated all the time, some the same, or it can mean

441
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:32,640
in one situation, I will be the idiot in another situation, you or you. You see, this is for me

442
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:40,960
how language is structured. It is open. The author himself is not a possessor of some hidden meaning.

443
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:47,600
That's why my favorite example is, you know, where Shakespeare, for me, the best cinema version

444
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:57,520
of Shakespeare Hamlet is Kurosawa in 62 in Japan, did a version of Hamlet with a wonderful title,

445
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:04,240
Only Evil People Sleep Good, which is a deep truth, you know, real evil people don't care. They

446
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:11,680
they're not haunted. And again, it's set in modern Japan, Hamlet is a student returns to

447
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:18,240
Tokyo from United. But what I'm saying is you see what I'm aiming at. This I or I'll give you

448
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:25,200
another classical example. I remember from the Puy this quote, you are too young, call to be some

449
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:33,520
23 years ago, there was a presidential candidate in France, Edouard Balladur, who say, but when

450
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:42,240
there were some pre-elections in Le Monde, there was a wonderful comment saying, if Balladur will

451
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:50,640
win next election, his victory will be necessary. You know the paradox, after something happens,

452
00:53:50,640 --> 00:54:00,880
it becomes retroactively necessary. And now you see where I am aiming at. I'm desperately looking,

453
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:07,680
but you almost converted me, I will have to work more in quantum physics for some kind of

454
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:19,280
ontological foundation of this openness that I like this idea of retroactive determinism. And I

455
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,240
will give you the ultimate social proof. This is not physics at all. But I love it.

456
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:32,960
A protestantism. People don't notice this obvious paradox. Weber, protestant, ethics,

457
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:40,160
origin of capitalism, blah, blah. But since if anything, capitalism is a system which

458
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:46,800
pushes you to constant effort and so on, isn't it strange that you would have then expected

459
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:54,960
that capitalism, sorry, protestantism would have been against, and this brings me back to your

460
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,560
point in a very nice way, that capitalism would have been against predetermination. Because if

461
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:06,080
everything is predetermined, why not my seat at home must await and watch Pornhub or whatever.

462
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:16,560
It's already decided. But precisely capitalism, which is the most active system, needs predestination.

463
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:23,120
Along what lines, along what you said, here I come back to you, here I will use you,

464
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:30,320
when you said wonderfully, yes, setting an equation objectively valid, but with one small

465
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:37,120
point, I don't know where I am in it. And that's protestantism in religion. You see now what I am

466
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:44,000
aiming at, you know. But nonetheless, you know, let's go to the end in

467
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:54,400
metaphysics. I see your point. But then what would be your answer to where

468
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:02,800
does then our limitation, now I'm going back to you, there is an objective description,

469
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:07,920
we can give it, we just don't know where we are. You don't think that

470
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:18,720
how can, how can many words interpretation account for this uniqueness of us?

471
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:29,520
Not uniqueness in any metaphysical sense, but how we are one unique, but still can arrive at this

472
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:37,680
objective, as it were, view of this. So let me say two things. For me, how do you account for the

473
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,240
subject itself? Him sense himself, I will not go into this bullshit now.

474
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,600
So I'm happy we can solve these questions so easily in this podcast. It'll be very,

475
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:55,200
very valuable to future generations. I'll say two things, one a little bit negative and one more

476
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:03,920
constructive that the negative thing is, I am reluctant to think about quantum mechanics when

477
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:09,680
I think about the uncertainty of human history, because there is a difference between quantum

478
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:17,920
mechanics and probability or stochasticness, right? There's plenty of room for unpredictability

479
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,560
in the world. In addition to what quantum mechanics gives us, what's special about

480
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:29,040
quantum mechanics is that there's not just the probability, the probability is derived from

481
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:35,360
this thing called the wave function, which distinguishes the idea that there's two possibilities,

482
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:41,200
but we don't know which one is true, from the idea that there's really both possibilities

483
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:47,040
at once. And I think that at least when it comes to human subjectivity and history,

484
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:52,880
you don't need to imagine that all the possibilities are simultaneously physically true.

485
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:58,720
You can just work with the fact that there's so much uncertainty and, excuse me,

486
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:07,920
unpredictability in the real world, that we need a language of probability and computation and

487
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:14,560
information to really make progress on these things. And it might involve the past in an

488
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:21,120
intricate way. In fact, I'll reveal, I'll mention two funny things. One is, I recently did a podcast

489
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:26,160
with Katie Elliott, who's a philosopher, and she made very much a similar point that you're

490
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:32,720
making about Protestantism. We were talking about predestination and eternalism, and she said that

491
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:38,240
she can make eternalism. She convinced herself that Calvinism was okay.

492
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:44,560
I know, but this is the latest theory. It's no longer Luther, it's Calvinism, which is elevated.

493
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,120
The problem with Calvinism is you're either blessed and going to go to heaven or you're not.

494
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:58,320
But you never know. But you never know. So the worry, she points out, is very well known,

495
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:04,240
is that, well, I can just act bad because I'm predestined to go to heaven or not. But what

496
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:09,600
you don't understand is that God knows that you're going to act bad. And so if you act bad,

497
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:14,560
you're bringing to reality the possibility that you're not going to go to heaven. So even though

498
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:19,760
it is predestined, because you don't know, it is still in your best interest to act good.

499
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,280
I know this thing, I forgot his name.

500
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:34,640
My God, I forgot his name. Protestant, I'll put it back, whatever. Theodist, theologist,

501
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:41,680
who is also known as the one who uses analytic philosophy. And he precisely in the terms of

502
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:48,320
beyond the speed of light, he defended Protestantism because he said exactly what you said now.

503
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:57,760
Like, if I'm predestined, why should I act good and so on? But again, God is beyond time.

504
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,160
God knows how you will decide. Exactly. No, that's why it's...

505
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,960
It's like Newcombe's paradox. That's how we got into it. Yes, if you believe that there are

506
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:12,480
oracles that know about the future, you will behave differently than if you don't. But anyway,

507
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,920
the other thing I wanted to say, I wrote a short piece, a short essay that I published on my blog

508
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,760
years ago called, I hope you'll be amused by this, the universe is structured like a language.

509
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,920
So somehow for me, I am universe, not unconscious, but universe.

510
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,320
Not the unconscious. The universe is structured like a language. So I quote you and I quote

511
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:40,400
some quantum physicists. And the basic idea is that the universe evolves from

512
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:50,800
a very orderly, low entropy early state to very disorderly, messy future state. Along the way,

513
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,840
complex structures appear. This is the kind of thing that at the Santa Fe Institute,

514
01:00:55,840 --> 01:01:01,040
we're very interested in understanding. And the implication is that there...

515
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:07,040
Somewhere there in the laws of physics, in the laws of dynamics, in the way that we think about

516
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:12,800
how the universe marches forward, there exists the potential, the potentiality for

517
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:19,200
interesting complex things to happen. And even though they were not sort of embedded intrinsically

518
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:24,720
in the initial conditions, they came to be because of the structure of the dynamics along the way.

519
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:31,440
And maybe quantum mechanics does play a role in that. This is all stuff that nobody claims to

520
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:40,720
understand very, very well. But if there's something computational or useful about complex

521
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,880
structures coming into existence, then that would be very nice to understand. And by the way,

522
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:51,520
by complex structures, I include you and me. Why did living beings come into existence,

523
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:56,400
even though the second law of thermodynamics says that the universe just rolls down to more

524
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:03,200
and more disorder? And the suggested answer is that the way that you get to more and more disorder

525
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:09,440
is to pass through intricate, complicated things. And you can't predict very well which one they're

526
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:17,360
going to be. Can I now bombard you with my last big meta-physical point? Since I was told and you

527
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:26,720
indicated you also do cosmology and so on. Okay, to cut it thought directly to the thing.

528
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:33,600
Is Big Bang theory out or not? Because I hear again and again that you can get that. I'm sorry.

529
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:42,160
Traces of something that must have gone off before Big Bang and so on, all that stuff. So the idea is

530
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:48,240
almost a kind of Stalinist dialectical materialist visual of repeated Big Bang here,

531
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:56,000
collapses here, explodes there. Where do you stand here? So the sad thing is that the phrase

532
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:03,920
the Big Bang theory refers to two very different ideas at the same time. One is the whole history

533
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:11,040
of the universe from t equals zero to today, where it started hot and dense and it rapidly

534
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:17,520
expanded and galaxies and stars coalesced out of it. And the whole bit, the universe is approximately

535
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:24,640
14 billion years old, all of that. That story is just 100% solid. It's not going away. There was

536
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:30,400
just this week excitement on Twitter because someone claimed it was completely wrong, but they were

537
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:36,720
completely, they were themselves completely wrong. What can I tell you? There's so much evidence in

538
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:42,000
favor of this general picture, 14 billion years, et cetera, that we don't need to worry about that

539
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,920
being overturned by future experiments. Nobody wants to do this. They just claimed that there

540
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,720
must have been something other Big Bangs before. They don't say there is no Big Bang.

541
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:58,480
Well, sadly, no, there are people who still think that even the story I just told you is wrong,

542
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,600
but then they're sadly misguided people. I'm just letting you know that you can find some

543
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:08,160
crazy claims that the universe is 30 billion years old or infinitely older. There's still people out

544
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:14,560
there who say those things. 6,000 also last Thursday. Yeah, these are all on the table.

545
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:19,520
But now the harder question is that sometimes we use the phrase the Big Bang to refer to

546
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:26,160
just the moment t equals zero, right? Just the first moment. Forget about what happened after that,

547
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:31,760
but the actual event. Lots of nature, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's right. Now there,

548
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:38,320
the only honest thing we can say is we have no idea what happened. Physics is not up to the task

549
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:44,240
of saying whether there was truly a singularity, whether that was truly the beginning of the universe,

550
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:50,640
whether it was a bounce or a quantum nucleation event. All the options are on the table. I'm

551
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:56,080
responsible for some of the options. There's a picture. This picture right here is one of my

552
01:04:56,080 --> 01:05:02,480
favorite theories where the universe is infinitely old. So I think that the idea that the Big Bang

553
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:08,480
that we talk about is not the beginning is absolutely viable, but we have no way of knowing

554
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:16,800
whether it's true or not right now. Now, can I, so you don't agree with those? I read some reports

555
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:27,200
on it that if we analyze these early stages, Big Bang, blah, blah, we can find in it

556
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:34,400
immanently traces of something that must have happened before. You don't think this is necessary?

557
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:40,000
I don't think so. I know that people have pursued that possibility and Penrose is one of them,

558
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,840
and I'm very, very glad they are pursuing the possibility, but I think that the data so far

559
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:52,960
as well as the theoretical predictions are that anything interesting gets wiped out in the interim

560
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,680
in that period since the Big Bang, everything was just smooth and featureless. I would love

561
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:02,880
to be wrong about that, and I hope I am, but I wouldn't buy any existing claims along those lines.

562
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:11,760
But another thing that bothers me, not bothers me, it is that I hope we are here on the same

563
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:17,680
materialist side. You must have known, everybody quotes it, a dialogue, I even don't know, did it

564
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:25,360
really happen or not? Stephen Hawking was at some conference with the Pope and the Polish reactionary

565
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:34,880
guy told him, here we have no misunderstanding, Mr. Scientist, your topic is Big Bang and after

566
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:44,960
our topic is before, you know, I don't buy the story. I think this, sir, within the space of

567
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:52,240
science for an opening where somehow religion or another dimension enters, I hope we agree,

568
01:06:52,240 --> 01:07:00,000
this is absolutely wrong perspective, this desperate attempts, you know, to, to, to,

569
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:05,200
completely wrong. I mean, I don't think that religion is very informative for anything interesting. I

570
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:10,880
think that it's, it's plays a hugely important historic and cultural role that I respect very

571
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,600
much. But when I want to think about why the universe exists or where it came from, I'm going

572
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:20,160
to think about science and philosophy. I'm not going to think about religion. In fact, I think

573
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:25,840
that your Hawking story is true. And it's a reflection, there was a previous story, you know,

574
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:31,440
lot of the development in early days in the thirties and forties of the Big Bang model

575
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:38,800
was by George Lemetra, who was a Belgian priest. And the Pope put him on some commission to, you

576
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:45,520
know, science and religion. And the Pope at the time, who I think was pious, said, well, this

577
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:50,320
Big Bang theory is great. It proves that Genesis was right. It proves that the universe had a

578
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:57,040
beginning. And Lemetra said, no, no, no, no, do not, do not say that. Because if you started

579
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:01,440
saying, well, we've proven religion right by science, tomorrow, science is going to change

580
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,800
its mind. And you don't want to say, oh, well, we were wrong about religion.

581
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:11,200
You know, this may interest you. I always admire, but I despise them. Don't be afraid.

582
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:16,560
Some fundamentalists, I had along these lines, a very interesting debate,

583
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:24,720
some time ago with the Catholic friend, who was at least honest. You remember that mystery of

584
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:31,600
the Turin Shroud, you know, are those are those stains there, Christ blood. And you know what

585
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:41,600
confidentially this highly placed bishop told me, she prays to God every evening that this is not

586
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:48,720
really Christ's blood. You know what, how he reasoned. If this is somehow we prove it, what

587
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:55,760
don't ask me how Christ's blood, then the first question is, let's analyze DNA. And what we will

588
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:03,600
get there, probably now an extremely brutal, that Christ was the result of, of Virgin Mary

589
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:10,880
screwing with some servant there. But it's better not to know. But some American fundamentalists

590
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:19,680
had a crazy answer. God doesn't have a DNA. So we will just get the double DNA of Virgin Mary

591
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:28,800
herself. You know, so this is for me the most dangerous temptation. This naive fundamentalist,

592
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:36,560
which even lack this, what I find in authentic religion is this radical openness. For example,

593
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:43,680
great guys, the one who was loved by by Nils Bohr Kirkegaard, he said, I'm not sure that I believe,

594
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:49,600
I only maybe believe that I believe. And I think the moment you go into fundamentalism,

595
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:56,080
you are lost. You are lost in the sense that you put, but so the final point,

596
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:08,480
you know why I like so much this quantum physics against this Einsteinian view,

597
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:17,440
because it's usually, and I think they're idiots. I hope we agree here generally, usually people claim

598
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:24,000
Einstein was more a materialist, objective reality and so on while Bohr

599
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:33,360
opened up the path for all this stuff. But I believe that it's almost the opposite, that

600
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,360
Einstein is interesting. You know, his famous

601
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:48,880
retort to Nils Bohr. God doesn't play dice. And then he even says that I don't believe in personal

602
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:57,920
God, but there is a divine dimension in this eternal cosmic order, the beauty of loss of

603
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:05,520
nature and so on and so on. And we all know Bohr, here I bow my head to him, gave a perfect answer.

604
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:17,280
Don't tell God what to do. What I like here is that I think that if not in the sense of any fully

605
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:28,320
religious sense, but in a sense of a belief in a firm order of our reality, this is for me

606
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:37,360
the most basic, even today I would call it not theological dimension, but this belief in what

607
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:44,000
in my Lacanians were gone, I call the big other. Even if we don't know it, there is a cosmic order

608
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:55,280
and so on. But you know that here, I think that one tool mechanics opens up a path to a much more

609
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:01,360
radical materialism. And I put it, maybe you know the story in this way. And I was so glad

610
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:08,960
narcissistically. Two, three months ago, I watched on Austrian TV and interviewed the Austrian guy,

611
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:20,880
Salinger, the one of the three. And the interviewer lady asked him, literally mentioning my name,

612
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:28,800
that what about my idea that quantum, this old joke that I like to repeat, you probably know it,

613
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:37,200
that quantum physics demonstrates that God is an imperfect lazy idiot, that God was too lazy to

614
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:45,520
determine things to the end. And we, as it were, went too far. And he said that there is a lot,

615
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:52,720
at least in Europe, a lot standing joke about this, that quantum physics is one big proof that

616
01:12:52,720 --> 01:13:01,360
God is lazy. He didn't want to do all the work, you know, and that now, so I think this is my big

617
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:08,880
effort. We have, we are on the same line here, I think, how to read quantum mechanics in a strict

618
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:16,320
materialist way, how to get rid of all this, you know, quantum mechanics means, you know,

619
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:23,200
the whole syllogism is horrible. Quantum mechanics means only observer brings possibilities to

620
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:29,920
reality, A, the universe really exists, B, so there must be a mega observer who is,

621
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:38,480
who is God. But still, let's maybe slowly and at the same time, conclude with some, so I will

622
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:45,440
have to think a lot more, because I'm still Boda, and I will quote you simply by your final

623
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:54,160
formula, which is this wonderful one of many world's interpretation, we can describe the world

624
01:13:54,160 --> 01:14:03,440
perfectly, we just don't know where we are in it. My goal, I obviously don't know enough of size, is

625
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:11,920
to somehow in a totally, not in an idealist way, this means a reality just to have an observer,

626
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:21,040
but in a truly materialist way to somehow find a crack inconsistency in reality, which is not

627
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:27,440
subject, but which opens up the space for subtlety, in what sense, let me conclude before I confuse

628
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:35,680
you, because we here come at the point of freedom, I read Penrose, who likes to, he's one of those

629
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:44,320
who think that you can ground human freedom in quantum phenomena, but I think that even if you

630
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:53,760
accept a radical uncertainty, openness, this is not freedom, freedom is not as intelligent people

631
01:14:53,760 --> 01:15:00,880
want to call it, and freedom is not contingency, freedom is a different sort of determinism,

632
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:08,240
I do that because I decided so and so on, so this quick link, and it's very popular among

633
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:14,640
chief philosophers today, oh but doesn't already quantum physics open up the space for freedom,

634
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:21,520
it's, do you agree it's wrong, it's totally, I completely agree that that is wrong, but I will

635
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,240
mention something that I've been thinking about only recently, in fact maybe in the last hour you've

636
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:33,440
helped me clarify it, but there is a role for quantum mechanics, literally quantum mechanics,

637
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:39,200
not just metaphorically, in accounting for the richness of the world that we see around us in

638
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:45,200
the following sense, what if classical mechanics were true, right, what if there was no wave

639
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:51,280
function, everything was perfectly deterministic, you could be Laplace's demon, so you could know

640
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,280
the complete state of the world today, and that would predict the state of the world in the future

641
01:15:55,280 --> 01:16:01,520
in the past, if that's true, then all the richness around us, including you and me,

642
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:07,760
Robinson having this discussion, was inherent in the initial condition of the universe, right,

643
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:14,880
but no, I would play your role before, it depends how you define the work inherent,

644
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:21,440
you can also read, yes it does, but I have a definition, stability, blah blah, not fully

645
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:27,840
deterministic, you know, sorry, go on. What I'm imagining is if classical mechanics

646
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:33,600
had been true, then you could take our universe now, you could use the laws of physics to evolve

647
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:39,040
it to the early time, and it would look smooth and, you know, featureless, but only because

648
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:45,840
there were very, very, very subtle correlations there, that you could then evolve backward,

649
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:51,200
back forward to the present day, like we were implicit, let's put it that way,

650
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:57,040
in the initial conditions of the universe, but when you have quantum mechanics, now that's not

651
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:05,040
true anymore, the early universe can be truly simple and featureless, and what happens is,

652
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:12,400
as these branches happen and decoherence happens, then individual parts of the universe can begin

653
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:18,320
to look complex, and you can't predict exactly where you're going to be, because like we said,

654
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:22,320
there's many different futures, and you're going to be in all of them, and there's different versions

655
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:27,760
of you that will be in all of them, but the sort of, the action of quantum mechanics is to start

656
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:35,040
from a simple, beautiful, pristine state, and create many, many, many very complicated, very

657
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:40,960
interesting world. Now I will try to strike back with a precise metaphysical question, you said

658
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:48,160
at the beginning in a much more complex way, but some basic, simple, whatever you call it,

659
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:56,960
simplicity, but wouldn't it, if we were to be able, I'm returning to your idea of this

660
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:03,440
ideal observer, which would have seen the entire picture, all the possibilities, wouldn't that

661
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:11,520
also involve some kind of return to simplicity, I'm not saying that it is a simplistic image,

662
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:18,560
it's very complex, I know all the options and so on, but in a way it would have been a flat well,

663
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:23,360
like everything is, well I think this is good, there's a very good point, but I think it's the

664
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:30,560
difference between hardware and software, right, an observer like Laplace's demon who could know

665
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:38,800
everything and do all the calculations is a very simple concept, not that complicated, but the data,

666
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:44,160
the software that that person would need to actually do the calculation correspond,

667
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:50,320
where universe would be incredibly complicated, whereas in quantum mechanics, Stephen Hawking

668
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:55,040
and Jim Hartle wrote it down, the way function of the universe, and all of the complexity can just

669
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:58,720
come about universe by universe, world by world, afterward.

670
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:06,640
No, no, I see, I see, yes, oh my god, there are so many, okay, sorry, I'm

671
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:15,120
slowly getting tired, but there are so many points here, now I see where I will have to

672
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:24,480
rethink my position, I will, can you, this precise idea that you mentioned, now you can

673
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:30,320
you can even use the middleman, exclude this or what, but I would love to have,

674
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:39,360
do you have a text where you develop that precise point, many worlds, ideal observer,

675
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:44,240
everything objective, we just don't know where we are, is there a text by you?

676
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,800
Not yet, but I'm happy to write something down, like I said, I've just been thinking about it,

677
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:56,800
in the last few weeks, I like this idea that this is my dream, that I write texts so that

678
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:03,280
somebody will quote them, if it's directly, it's very possible if someone else has written it down

679
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:08,960
already, the big problem for me, yeah, you know, yeah, I mean it might be completely unoriginal,

680
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,800
that's very possible, so I will look to see if anyone else has already written it, and if not,

681
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,640
I will write something down, what's the trick that people use different terms, this nightmares

682
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:22,400
happen to me, they do, I know, yeah, you don't find it, but another guy with just different terms,

683
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:30,000
yeah, I know, the same thing, you know, we're all just remixing, Slavo, I know it's late for

684
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,400
you where you are, is it okay if I butt in with a couple of questions before we finish, yeah,

685
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:41,840
but don't expect, I mean, I'm here, I will direct them toward, toward Sean, and you can, you can

686
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:47,680
cut in as you, as you like, but now I love this idea, now I always make this joke when people

687
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:54,480
ask me, would you like to have a dialogue, I say, yes, I love dialogues, but the way they're written,

688
01:20:54,480 --> 01:21:02,160
the late Plato's dialogue, where one guy talks all the time, and the other guy just every 10 minutes

689
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:10,640
says, by Zeus, so it is Socrates, so I really don't know, to that, please ask him, ask Sean.

690
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:20,560
Okay, yeah, so I haven't read any of Lee Smolin yet, though Einstein's Unfinished Revolution is on

691
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:26,560
my list, but so I've read an article that Slavo wrote, I think it's upcoming in a book next year

692
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:31,760
on quantum theory, but in it, in theory, just one short chapter, sorry, yeah,

693
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:38,080
yeah, just one chapter, just one chapter, but Slavoy paraphrases Smolin's belief that quantum

694
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:44,000
mechanics is the most successful theory ever formulated, but the only problem with it is that

695
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:50,160
it is wrong. And I have the sense that it is at least incomplete in that it doesn't

696
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:55,280
go here with relativity, so there's no quantum gravity, no theory of everything that's going

697
01:21:55,360 --> 01:22:01,120
to find here at Smolin. Right, right, but what I'm wondering is how you glossed this idea and

698
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:08,080
more important, more relevant to our discussion is whether the many worlds interpretation is

699
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:12,240
something that's in jeopardy on the road to this theory of everything.

700
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:19,600
Yeah, so I, there is a temptation in certain circles to, sorry, that's that's a little too

701
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:24,480
prejudicial. We don't know what the final theory of everything is, right, so each one of us as

702
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:29,840
individual researchers will have our favorite ways of trying to make progress. And this goes back

703
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:34,240
to what we discussed at the very beginning about preferences for different versions of

704
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:41,840
quantum mechanics. Many worlds, as a theory, is as simple as it is possible for a theory to be.

705
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:46,720
The problem with it is that connecting it to the richness of the world involves some tricky

706
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:52,640
metaphysical and physical steps, right, about which people can be rightfully skeptical. Whereas

707
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:58,000
something like hidden variables or whatever is an ugly complicated theory, but the world is

708
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,480
ugly and complicated, so it matches the world in a more easy way. And you can, you can have

709
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:06,800
different feelings about what to do. Somewhat, there's a, there's a third way, which is someone

710
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:12,480
like Lee who says like, I don't quite see how it is working right now. Therefore, I will throw it

711
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:19,520
all out and start from scratch and try to do better. And to me, we're nowhere close to that

712
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:25,200
point yet. We have not yet done anything like trying to understand the world in the quantum

713
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:31,680
language to motivate trying to improve on quantum mechanics. In particular, just to be clear about

714
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:37,840
relativity, there's special relativity and general relativity. Quantum mechanics and special relativity

715
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:43,200
are 100% compatible. That is literally quantum field theory, which is the best tested theory in

716
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:48,560
the universe ever. General relativity, which says that space time is dynamical, and that's what

717
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:55,200
gravity is. It is true. We do not have a once and for all final quantum theory of gravity.

718
01:23:55,200 --> 01:24:01,760
But again, to me, many worlds is the most promising route forward for doing that.

719
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:06,480
And if you'll indulge me just for, you know, one more minute here, the reason why I think we're,

720
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:13,920
we're stuck is because even the most highly trained physicist learns classical physics first.

721
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:21,760
Newton's laws, the Kepler's laws, the planets, etc. And then they're taught how to take a classical

722
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:27,600
theory and convert it into a quantum theory to quantize it, right? And that's what we do with

723
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:33,680
electromagnetism and the standard model of particle physics and all those things. There's no law, rule,

724
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:39,600
or even suggestion that says that the correct quantum theory of the universe has to be obtained

725
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,000
by starting with a classical theory and quantizing it. The universe doesn't do that,

726
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,280
it just is quantum from the start. And if you want to imagine that maybe that's why

727
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:54,080
it's been difficult to quantize gravity, because you shouldn't be quantizing gravity,

728
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:58,480
you should be thinking about quantum mechanics and finding gravity within it.

729
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,360
And clear, I would argue, I'm not going to bother you with it now, but I would strongly

730
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:07,360
argue the right framework to do that in is exactly many worlds.

731
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:19,200
But okay, now it came to me, my last, not attack, but problem. You know, I mentioned this, I admit it,

732
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:26,720
very suspicious parallel between many worlds and you pointed out immediately the difference and this

733
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:33,440
in our symbolic universe superpositions, this may happen, that may happen. But what is,

734
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:40,640
this is my restraint, not that the theory is too crazy, my god, I'm a Hegelian, the more crazy

735
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:52,560
it is, the more we like it. But I have another problem. But this different, for example, 99%

736
01:25:52,560 --> 01:26:02,960
the discappals, 1% okay, and we have both. But though these two, or I don't know how many,

737
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:10,560
intimate universes, somehow interact or it's just totally different lines. This is, as a

738
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:17,200
philosopher, maybe it's a wrong instinct, I would be obsessed with some interaction, you know,

739
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:23,200
let's to say it's very primitive, what I will say, I in advance apologize once to say yes,

740
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:31,520
we live in this 99%, but somehow to understand it, you have to read it against the background of

741
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:39,840
that shitty 1%, which that's what I don't find in many worlds, or I don't know enough about it.

742
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:45,280
How would you react to this? The short answer is the different worlds will not interact.

743
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:51,440
This is something which Everett, when he first wrote down the ideas in the 1950s,

744
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:55,760
he was not clear on, he didn't have quite the technology that we have, the intellectual

745
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:01,360
technology we have. But this is exactly what decoherence gets you. Since the 70s and 80s,

746
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:07,600
when we understand decoherence better, it's not just that you are allowed to think about

747
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:12,480
different parts of the wave function as separate worlds. But it's literally the right way to think

748
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:17,520
about them. They don't interact, they won't interact going forward, because they've decoherent

749
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:23,520
from each other. And there's a technical exposition about that involving states in the environment

750
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:28,000
being perpendicular to each other. There's a small footnote there, because if you wait

751
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:36,080
really long, if you wait 10 to the 100 years, then all of the worlds will in some sense blur back

752
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:44,000
together into one big world. The use of our universe is a crucial feature in allowing these

753
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,640
different worlds to be separate. But even though Hollywood would like it to be otherwise, in the

754
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:53,360
real world, the separate many world branches are completely non-interacting with each other.

755
01:27:55,360 --> 01:28:01,600
It was mentioned to me by our middleman that, did you or am I misreading you,

756
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:07,760
that you kind of read in detail the strip of that shitty movie and this very predicate makes it

757
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:14,240
clear why they don't like it, everything everywhere and so on. Because what I didn't like in it is

758
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:20,640
that with all these different versions, at the end it has this shitty conclusion, but this is the

759
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:26,720
real world, we should accept it and so on. I would like, what is missing for me in the movie is

760
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:33,920
precisely what you're going to tell this, but we don't know where we are and so on. This uncertainty

761
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:40,480
is lost, I think, in the movie. You know, you're completely right. I didn't read it ahead of time,

762
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:45,600
but I did interview the director's writers on my podcast. We had a wonderful conversation.

763
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:51,280
They're very smart people, but the demands of narrative are different than the demands of physics

764
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:58,000
is the problem. And not only multiverse movies, but time travel movies have the same

765
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:04,880
feature where even though there's multiple timelines or whatever, the narrative focus

766
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:13,040
implicitly lends more value to certain characters and devalues other characters.

767
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:17,360
And if this were the real world, that would be completely illegitimate, right? Like all the

768
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:20,880
different people in the different timelines, they have a right to exist. You're telling me

769
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:26,000
you're going to eliminate my timeline just because it's not yours? You're a genocidal monster. That's

770
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:33,200
terrible. No, because that's my problem. Now I will go even one step lower. Did you see Indiana

771
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:42,720
Jones's face? I did, I did. You did? Oh, we are normal people. You know, the moment I, like,

772
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:49,440
it's a shitty movie, but for some reasons I found some, first for me, it's a very desperate movie.

773
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:55,920
It's clear that Indiana Jones's desire is archimedes. I want to remain there. And that

774
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:02,240
beat punches him, go back. And it's a very desperate ending. Her function of fervor,

775
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:10,240
that actress, is not erotic. It's just to bring the couple back together. And you know how they are,

776
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:18,320
two desperate old men embracing and so on. Can you even compare this with being in Syracuse at

777
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:25,440
that point and so on? This I find much more productive. The conclusion is not, but this is

778
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:34,960
the real world or whatever. You know, I could not possibly agree more. I am, I don't like the movie,

779
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:41,200
but I find now, you know what attracted me to Indiana Jones 5? That it was so universally

780
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:47,920
attached, a total bullshit or whatever. It's, no, it automatically evokes my sympathy, no?

781
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:55,040
Well, there's, there's a fundamental conservative, teleological aspect to this way of thinking that

782
01:30:55,040 --> 01:31:01,040
our timeline, our universe is the right one and we should be in it. And we cannot possibly think

783
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:06,000
about improving it by changing the past or anything like that. I think that the filmmakers missed a

784
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,800
chance they should have left Indy, spoiler alert, back there with Archimedes. He would have been

785
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:17,920
happier. He's getting old anyway. They went for a sappy lowbrow ending. No, but so at least

786
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:25,920
we can conclude in this way then that in spite of all from my side, unresolved dangers and so on,

787
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:34,240
we, you put it wonderfully now. The big lesson of also in many words, the quantum physics is

788
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:41,520
always bear in mind that this is not the only possible world. You know, don't, don't put this

789
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:48,480
universe as a major or as you put it nicely in this teleological sense, like that's what again

790
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:55,440
bothered me in everything everywhere. As if the reality is here in that tax office even with

791
01:31:55,440 --> 01:32:03,680
genie liquor display and all these tricks gotten back is thus so that you return more satisfied,

792
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:12,160
happy to this world. I would opt for a much more desperate solution that, that she that actors

793
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:18,000
would have traveled in different worlds were many much better than totally desperate. She ends up

794
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:25,600
here with the awareness of what would have been, you know. You know, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't

795
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:33,840
see the script for that before it was made, but I did consult on the Avengers movies with Thanos

796
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:40,560
destroying the world and then they went back in time to fix it, etc. And I argued that if you go

797
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,800
back in time and fix it, you know, you're, they had this multiple timeline thing and I don't want

798
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:50,320
you to eliminate a timeline. I think that's, that's terrible. But as I said, what you should do is allow

799
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:58,000
the timelines to re rejoin each other so that individuals have memories of both in their

800
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,160
future selves, but they didn't go for that. It was too complicated. No, but that again, the problem

801
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:12,880
for me would be, I would like to rework many worlds interpretation, but I know I'm here

802
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:19,040
confusing a pure physical process with symbolic one where this would have been possible, you know,

803
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:28,560
this rejoining key, not in this sense, because as for this time travel travels and so on, you know,

804
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:35,280
which is a wonderful, totally pessimist version of it. I forgot the title, you know, the the

805
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:43,600
British now he's a little bit old actor Christopher Fry. She played Oscar Wilde also in the movie.

806
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:52,000
No, yeah. She wrote a novel which is so desperately pessimist. He even done almost

807
01:33:52,000 --> 01:34:01,120
realistically physically scientifically nonsense. A guy, a scientist whose family died in Auschwitz,

808
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:10,480
wants to prevent this. So she invents a rather primitive time travel machine. Not you can

809
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:17,680
move up and down. Just you pick up a moment in time and you can do some little change there.

810
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:26,240
So what she does in this is this, this scientist, she there was in the village where Hitler was

811
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:36,240
born, a small stream above for which all the village was drinking water. So she puts around the time of

812
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:46,880
when Hitler had to be conceived, she puts into the water very limited intervention, just some

813
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:56,960
poisonous element which makes women infertile. So Hitler is not born. Then he steps out of his

814
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:06,240
laboratory and goes into the world and finds a nightmare. Nazism developed, but instead of Hitler,

815
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:13,680
somebody like Werner von Braun, a much more able scientist became the leader and developed the

816
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:19,520
bomb and the Nazis won. So here we have a wonderful, totally pessimistic denouement.

817
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:28,000
He tries to go back to bring back Hitler, so that at least the good guys will win.

818
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:35,920
I love, speaking about alternate histories, there is a wonderful book that I love, I forgot the title,

819
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:43,280
a whole book on alternate histories, stories about what might have happened with Hitler.

820
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:48,480
There are the usual lines, he survived, went to Argentina, whatever, blah, blah, blah. Then

821
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:56,800
different battles, how he might have won, but my favorite one is in his youth. Isn't this wonderful

822
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:05,440
alternate history? Hitler succeeds as a painter and whoops into painting his horrible visuals,

823
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:14,400
becomes a great modernist, becomes a celebrated artist and end of Nazism, so on, you know. Although

824
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:22,480
this is, I know, I don't take it seriously, but it's very refreshing to think along these terms,

825
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:28,240
that's all I'm saying. It was so delicious, sorry I'm getting tired, but I really will,

826
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:35,200
so you will write, you don't yet have that text. I don't, but I'll think about it, definitely.

827
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:43,280
Please, because, okay, then, can I, in quoting Q, refer to this event here? Because I really want to

828
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:49,840
immediately, quickly, in the chapter that you, the middleman know, I will add a footnote and,

829
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:57,120
as not a footnote, a couple of pages, but in a sincere way. You know how we intellectuals,

830
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:02,320
you are more honest, I hope so, physicist, human, you know how you cheat? I will

831
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:11,040
to write a page and then I put a footnote. When I already wrote these pages, I noticed that a

832
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:18,400
friend of mine will cheat a similar idea and so on, you know, Eurella, I will not do this, I will do it.

833
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:26,240
100% yes. I'm really grateful for this, because, you know, no, we didn't just blah, blah, and we

834
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:32,960
didn't just fraternally agree, we located the difference, but at the same time, we draw so many

835
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:41,440
precise lines, you know, because would you agree to finish in a more upbeat sense that, my God,

836
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:49,760
we live in a wonderful time where the big, the big even metaphysical questions are again

837
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:56,640
arising, you know, in the sense of, yeah, even one big fan sees it now, you cannot just

838
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:04,160
ignore it, no? Right, and I do want to, I just want to insert that if you, if you go back to the past

839
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:09,520
and change things, they like, as you imply, they might get better or worse, there's no rule that

840
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:17,440
we live in the best, or the worst, because I even read a pessimist novel about Stalinism,

841
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:24,880
where Stalin is killed, but he's killed in 35, and the one who takes over is Yezhov,

842
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:29,760
his secret policeman, and it's even worse, you can imagine, you know, if you were, yes.

843
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:36,480
Yeah, that's, I think my pessimist lesson also from my, although in Yugoslavia, communism was pretty

844
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:44,560
soft, you know, but you know, here also, I think a quantum approach in a general sense

845
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:51,440
gives you to think, for example, I will make not just a political point, but the modest ones,

846
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:58,240
I was recently at the round table, sorry, in London, and there were some black ladies from South

847
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:06,080
Africa, and I asked them frankly, I wanted to be honest, not Eurocentric, I said, listen, I read

848
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:12,240
a lot how in South Africa, electricity, cops, the state is falling apart, blah, blah, blah,

849
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:19,120
and I almost cried, one of the black ladies was so honest, he said I'm engaged for decades in A

850
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:28,560
and C struggle, but he told me he told us that the situation is now so sad that among the poor blacks,

851
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:38,720
blacks, poor in South Africa, you notice the predominant nostalgia forever, because he said,

852
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:44,560
listen, the standard of living was even a little bit better than now. They had enough thought, blah,

853
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:50,480
blah, now it's no electricity chaos, while there was, it was a police state which wins

854
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:56,720
less violence, some kind of basic order, and now, you know, the black are, you know, that now,

855
01:39:56,720 --> 01:40:04,800
under, after three decades of how of A and C rule, you know that South Africa is a country with

856
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:13,280
the greatest tension between rich and poor in the world, in the entire world, and then, of course,

857
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:19,680
something totally predictable happened, another black lady attacked me, although I didn't say

858
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:25,200
anything, as a racist, you don't have the right to talk about this, you know, she played the game of

859
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:32,800
you, white people are responsible even now for all the mistakes, to be cynical, he played this in

860
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:40,080
bad sense, super determination, you white people are responsible for all the mistakes now, you know,

861
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:49,280
and here I think this kind of alternate thinking is necessary, like where did think really go wrong,

862
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:57,840
and I think it's too naive, because the radical leftist answer is too naive, it's because Mandela

863
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:03,360
didn't go to the end, if he were to make no compromise with, but then it would have been,

864
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:11,520
then it would have been Mugabe Zimbabwe, you know, only earlier there, you know, and this is a terrifying

865
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:17,840
problem for me, but we are losing time, listen, it was such a pleasure for me, I hope that we

866
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:26,400
meet again, and are you allowed the middleman to give me Sean's email, and no, but I have it,

867
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:34,400
because you CC connect, yeah, I have it, if I will, can I don't, don't be afraid, I'm not this

868
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:41,040
kind of a stalker who now in two hours will ask you 10 questions, and say this, but if I have a

869
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:47,040
short precise question, can I ask you and you give me one sentence answer, you know,

870
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:51,760
because you are my only, the last thing I'm always tempted,

871
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:58,880
it's sensational, but is it true what many quantum physicists, okay, sound, which means that

872
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:06,080
Stephen Hawking did his real work while he was young, lately he was more just popularizing

873
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:11,920
thing, is this true or it's not so simple? I mean, that's, there is some truth in that,

874
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:16,080
but there's also truth in exactly the same statement applied to a lot of people who did

875
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:24,080
not have a degenerative neuron disease, so he was obsessed with these hidden variables for decades,

876
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:30,480
but it's, he'll meet 20s that he did his great work, no? This is a young person's game, one,

877
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:37,280
no matter what your level of physical ability is. That's why I shade, it's even historically wrong,

878
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:45,280
this tendency to look at the old age, the last text of words by a big name, as if there is some

879
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:51,760
final truth in them, it's totally wrong, like to amuse you with the last story,

880
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:59,360
Jacques Lacan, when he was dying, had a young mistress, Catherine Mio, and she almost made the

881
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:06,160
career out of being there at his side when she was dying, and he mumbled some things,

882
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:13,840
what did she mean with those, well, what if it was nothing, it was just a confused trembling,

883
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:21,520
and I see this even with many philosophers, a lot of them reach their greatest point in their

884
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:32,720
middle ages, and then they just slowly go down, I mean, no? Well, I hope sincerely that in the battle

885
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:42,080
of quantum physicists, you will emerge as a winner, and then it's your KGB terror to

886
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:48,640
do, you know, when I give a talk, and you know, usually before they ask you there,

887
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:53,600
could you just say somewhere to test the microphone, you know what I always say,

888
01:43:54,800 --> 01:44:03,280
Robespierre, no freedom for the enemies of freedom, this should be our motto, we thanks

889
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:11,040
very much, thanks very much, if you, the middleman, if there is something too stupid or whatever,

890
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:17,040
I give you, now I will be the victim, I give you all the Stalinist right to cut it short,

891
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:23,280
though we did whatever you want, I'm not a narcissist here, I'm really a communist at this

892
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:28,960
level, you know that whenever there is a conflict between an individual and an institution, I prefer

893
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:35,520
to be automatically on the side of the institute, because I edit some book series, and don't you

894
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:43,680
hate authors, you see, you talk one comma there, destroys everything and so on, you know, so I'm

895
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:51,680
really grateful for this, it helped me a lot, the only, my only reproach to you, Sean, is that

896
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:58,320
you ruined my evening, because I wanted this so dirty old movie, now I will have to go into it

897
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:06,160
and quickly write two, three pages, no? My apologies for that, that's what I do. No, here, I, you're

898
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:12,400
pardoned for everything, but not for this, when the people take power for this, okay, I'm a good guy,

899
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:19,920
you don't get gulag, but you will get two years of reeducation camp, you know, like, get up and

900
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:25,040
fight. I could use that anyway, that's okay, education is always good. Thanks very much, and

901
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:32,480
again, the middleman, really, I mean it, don't even ask me, do all the dirty stuff,

902
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:39,920
you know, all my confusions and one, sorry? The middleman is probably, is not going to be

903
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:45,120
cutting anything out, because this has been the middleman's most successful conversation yet,

904
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:51,280
since I haven't had to speak at all. But I like the middleman, the term, you know why, because

905
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:57,440
he wrote this show today, people don't like authority. I always like authority in the sense

906
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:04,400
that sometimes you need authority in the debate when it goes, but today, already at the level of

907
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:10,880
words, it gets confused, no longer likes to talk about director, leader, the favorite

908
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:18,480
term is ordinator, you know, it sounds, you keep all your power, but it sounds much more innocent,

909
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:24,240
you know, and just coordinating things, you know. So I know, and you know, that's why I still have

910
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:30,400
hope in Iran, I have connections there on the opposite side, and they told me, you know,

911
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:35,760
still you cannot contend Iran in spite of all that's going there now with something like Saudi Arabia.

912
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:41,920
Women were able to, women were able to protest precisely because they have a strong role, for

913
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:48,240
example, it's a common joke there that the big guy is a minister, usually a man.

914
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:55,840
Although, or even this is not the case, you have one, two feminine ministers in government, but

915
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:04,320
immediately when you make there to make a business deal, you discover that the minister is an idiot,

916
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:09,200
and you have to talk with persons around him who are in majority women.

917
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:18,880
What underestimated Iran, it's tremendous, they are so crazy, they translated 15 of my books,

918
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:24,960
they are, it's intellectual, no, this is not a good sign for them, it's a sign of contusion,

919
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:32,720
if I want to say is that it's intellectually alive, while in other countries, Egypt and so on,

920
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:40,880
it's very tragic how little they translate, they simply don't have this humanity, social sciences

921
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:45,440
life that we share, you know. The history does matter, the histories there are very different.

922
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:52,800
Yeah, yeah, but as Iranians point out, they are not simply a Muslim country, they are Farsi,

923
01:47:52,800 --> 01:48:00,480
Persian, no, and they always proudly point out, we are not Arabs, you know, sorry for this

924
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:07,440
because today you never know what will be proclaimed as racism, you know.

925
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:14,160
Yes, thank you both, this has been a blast. Hold on Geeselings, before you go, please like,
