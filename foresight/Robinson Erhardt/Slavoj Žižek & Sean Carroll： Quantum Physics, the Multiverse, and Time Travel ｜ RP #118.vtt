WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
Many words interpretation simply multiplies realities.

00:04.880 --> 00:12.160
We lose a special everything is true in the sense of all possible variations are true.

00:12.160 --> 00:22.240
So what I and in some sense what fascinates me the ontological incompleteness again disappears.

00:22.240 --> 00:28.240
Everything is fully there. The problem is our limited standpoint.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.000
Am I missing something here?

00:32.000 --> 00:37.760
Yeah, so I'm happy about this one because you are missing something and I can I can help a little bit where I like you.

00:37.760 --> 00:38.880
Yeah, yeah.

00:38.880 --> 00:49.760
Hello, Maggie Slings. It is Mother Goose, Robinson Earhart, here with the podcast and the introduction to Robinson's podcast number 118,

00:50.080 --> 00:57.920
which incidentally confirms that we are on a very strange branch of the wave function because my guests are

00:57.920 --> 01:04.400
Slavoj Žižek and Sean Carroll and I will keep their bios short since everyone knows them.

01:04.400 --> 01:10.400
But Slavoj is International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London

01:10.400 --> 01:15.360
and a senior researcher at the University of Ljubljana's Department of Philosophy.

01:15.360 --> 01:28.640
He was also the guest on episode 109, which was all about psychoanalysis, wokeness, racism, sexism, Nazis,

01:29.360 --> 01:37.360
curb your enthusiasm and 100 other things. It would be impossible to encapsulate all of the topics that we cover without

01:37.760 --> 01:42.640
talking for the talking for 90 minutes, the length of our episode.

01:42.640 --> 01:49.760
But Sean Carroll, on the other hand, is actually a quantum physicist. He is a cosmologist, a philosopher.

01:49.760 --> 01:59.920
He's a homeward professor of natural philosophy at Johns Hopkins University and fractal faculty at the Santa Fe Institute.

01:59.920 --> 02:06.000
He's also host of Sean Carroll's Minescape, which is an absolutely terrific show. I love it.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.520
I've listened to every episode on science, society, philosophy, culture, arts, ideas,

02:13.520 --> 02:19.440
and anything else Sean has been thinking about. But Sean, along with David Albert of Columbia,

02:19.440 --> 02:25.120
was a guest on episode 106, which covered the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics in great detail.

02:25.120 --> 02:34.800
And then we also talked about entropy and the enduringly fascinating topic of Boltzmann brains and then the fine-tuned universe.

02:34.800 --> 02:44.880
But in this episode, I am, as Slavoj refers to me, merely the middleman and a wallflower along with pins.

02:45.600 --> 02:52.880
And so I don't do much of the talking. So Sean and Slavoj, while I giggle in the background,

02:52.880 --> 03:01.280
do talk about quantum mechanics, the indeterminacy of small scale reality, cosmology and the Big Bang,

03:01.280 --> 03:09.200
some major figures like Niels Bohr, Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and then the world of sci-fi,

03:09.200 --> 03:14.560
including movies like everything, everywhere, all at once, Indiana Jones and the Avengers.

03:14.560 --> 03:21.760
And now one thing that I really have to mention, so pay attention now, is that Sean Carroll is an

03:21.760 --> 03:28.160
honorary fellow of the John Bell Institute for the Foundations of Physics, which is directed by

03:28.160 --> 03:36.480
another Robinson's podcast alumnus, and that is Tim Modlin of NYU. It's, at this point,

03:36.480 --> 03:44.480
still very much a nascent organization trying to secure its home. And it is meant to give a home to

03:44.480 --> 03:50.960
many of the topics that we discussed today and really has the who's who in the foundations of physics

03:50.960 --> 03:57.280
as contributors. And the JBI can really use any donations at this point in their early history.

03:57.280 --> 04:03.360
I've donated once and will certainly donate again as soon as my meager budget allows it.

04:03.920 --> 04:09.840
So anything you contribute will be greatly appreciated by the JBI. And finally, there are

04:09.840 --> 04:15.840
links to Sean's website, Sean's Twitter, and the biggest ideas in the universe in the description.

04:15.840 --> 04:23.840
So without any further ado, I hope you enjoy this wide-ranging conversation as much as I

04:23.840 --> 04:30.240
didn't so much have it, but got to enjoy listening to it as it happened myself.

04:40.480 --> 04:47.120
Slavoj, you're very well known for thinking about a lot of topics and Marxism, psychoanalysis,

04:47.120 --> 04:52.960
and Hegel come to mind, but quantum physics isn't one of them. So just to get us started,

04:53.920 --> 04:58.960
when did Q.M. and the various quantum theories catch your philosophical interest to the point

04:58.960 --> 05:02.800
that you've been concertedly writing and thinking about it a lot more lately?

05:04.640 --> 05:15.840
My, it's quite a series of topics. The first one is my philosophical obsession. I've written

05:15.840 --> 05:22.800
about it repeatedly and so on. And Sean, this is already to provoke you interrupt me at any point.

05:23.440 --> 05:32.240
What absolutely fascinates me in quantum physics is, again, maybe it's already wrong,

05:32.240 --> 05:40.400
I will say, this idea of to put it in philosophical terms, ontological incompleteness.

05:41.520 --> 05:48.960
For example, the point is not we cannot measure, at the same time, position and movement.

05:49.600 --> 05:56.960
That's for me not radical enough. It still means the particle has a measure in the position, we

05:56.960 --> 06:04.080
just can't, movement and position, we just can't measure it. But what if in more radical reading,

06:05.040 --> 06:13.600
reality is in itself ontologically incomplete? The point is not that if you analyze reality to the

06:13.680 --> 06:21.680
end, you will get a complete, a complete description with everything at its place and so on and so

06:21.680 --> 06:33.600
on. And as far as I can see, now you will ask me, how does this link with my philosophy? Because

06:33.600 --> 06:46.080
it's a very unorthodox reading. In my reading, even of Shegel, the final result is not you get

06:46.080 --> 06:55.440
the whole truth. The final result is that what you thought was just an epistemological obstacle,

06:55.440 --> 07:02.800
like we cannot get it all, just one aspect of the other. The final result is when you realize that

07:02.800 --> 07:10.480
what appeared to you as a limitation of your knowledge is, defines already the reality itself.

07:11.520 --> 07:20.480
Reality is in itself incomplete. Now I follow debates and I know the problems with this. If she

07:20.480 --> 07:30.640
known in the United States, she being Sabine Hosenfelder, the German one, her idea is, I'm sure

07:30.640 --> 07:38.480
you know a thousand times better than me, is a super big feminism. And basically,

07:39.600 --> 07:45.600
her idea is, if I follow it correctly, on Einstein's line, she had variables and so on,

07:45.600 --> 07:55.280
we just don't know it all. Where I see an interesting point that she makes is, and now comes

07:55.280 --> 08:08.480
Sean, my first question to you. Some physicists, one to which who I spoke, not as highly graded as you,

08:09.120 --> 08:19.200
insisted that all this focus on not the agent, what triggers the so-called collapse of the wave

08:19.280 --> 08:27.280
function, that is a secondary, unimportant problem, that you can even, this is the radical

08:27.280 --> 08:37.520
tendency, if I got it correctly, that you can define collapse even in an objective way. What

08:37.520 --> 08:47.680
comes to my mind are so-called decoherence theories, or another version is a quantity that as soon as

08:47.680 --> 08:55.360
the object is no longer at the subparticle level, but becomes part of our reality,

08:56.000 --> 09:05.280
automatically decoherence happens. Now, this brings me to another point, I hope we will

09:05.280 --> 09:12.560
have time later to approach it, which is time and space. Do you agree, because I was informed that

09:12.560 --> 09:20.960
this is also one of your topics? Is it true or not that this hidden variable's Einstein view

09:21.600 --> 09:28.960
is more focused on space as a more primary dimension? Didn't Einstein even at some point

09:28.960 --> 09:38.800
propose the theory that what we perceive as time, time movement, is really just moving along a certain

09:39.760 --> 09:46.000
spatial line and so on? On the other hand, there are many others, and for obvious reasons, it's

09:46.000 --> 09:56.960
closer to me, who claim that time is more radical, primordial, but let's begin with this, with what

09:56.960 --> 10:04.160
I told you. All this problem, and I know that- I think so, yeah. Collapse of wave function,

10:04.160 --> 10:11.760
observer, registration, when does it happen? Because I find all different versions, up to the

10:11.760 --> 10:18.560
cosmological one, that it's God himself, who is the ultimate observer, no reality without God,

10:19.520 --> 10:28.480
and to this more modest version, whatever, okay, teach me, where I'm totally losing my mind,

10:28.480 --> 10:35.200
and tell me at least the state of the things today. I think this is very good, because the time and

10:35.200 --> 10:41.280
space questions that you're raising are very, very good, but they come later, so the quantum mechanics

10:41.280 --> 10:47.120
collapse of the wave function questions come first, and to me, it's extremely embarrassing,

10:47.120 --> 10:53.680
but true, that physicists don't know what to think about exactly the questions that you are raising.

10:53.680 --> 10:59.200
So let me just quickly run through some of the options, because there are sensible people who

10:59.200 --> 11:02.640
believe all of them. You know, the fundamental fact that we're trying to

11:03.920 --> 11:11.520
accommodate ourselves to is that we have a way of describing the world that is super duper successful

11:11.520 --> 11:17.280
with what we call a wave function, the quantum state, the Schrodinger equation, all this mathematical

11:17.280 --> 11:23.120
apparatus, but then when we look at it, when we measure it, when we perceive it or experience it,

11:23.120 --> 11:31.040
we don't see that wave function. We see a position or a momentum, some observable quantity,

11:31.040 --> 11:34.720
and this is completely... Which is absolutely not reality, what we see always.

11:35.360 --> 11:40.880
Well, we... Yes, I don't want to prejudice by deciding what's ordinary reality yet, but we see

11:40.880 --> 11:47.600
things, and the things we see, I think what you're getting at is they do remind us of what we thought

11:47.600 --> 11:52.480
the universe was back in the days of classical mechanics. Newton would have said that there is

11:52.480 --> 11:57.920
a position, there is a velocity, now we say, well, we observe those, but that's not how we discuss

11:57.920 --> 12:02.640
what's really going on. So I can quickly run through at least three options that are very

12:02.640 --> 12:10.960
much on the table. There is a very conservative way of going where you say there really are

12:10.960 --> 12:17.600
positions and velocities, those are real things, and there is also something called the wave function,

12:17.600 --> 12:22.560
and it's a whole big complicated mess, and that is the hidden variables approach that,

12:22.560 --> 12:28.640
like you say, Einstein would have liked. There are still people who follow that, mostly in the

12:28.640 --> 12:34.080
context of what is called Bohmian mechanics. You have both a wave function and articles.

12:34.080 --> 12:41.440
That's what I wanted to say. How could these pilot waves... Isn't this still...

12:42.240 --> 12:49.360
There are the substantial entity particles or whatever, and you just accompany them as a

12:49.360 --> 12:55.680
capable aura with wave functions, you know? You know, I have to be honest, I'm not sympathetic

12:55.680 --> 13:02.560
to this point of view, so I have trouble defending it. For purely philosophical reasons, I'm not

13:02.560 --> 13:10.480
sympathetic, but let me now directly move to the third degree, but my KGB file on you

13:11.440 --> 13:18.560
tells me that you are sympathetic to many worlds. Reading. That's going to be the third of the three

13:18.560 --> 13:24.800
options I give you. Sorry, sorry, go on. Yes, sorry. Yes, one is hidden variables, just like you said.

13:24.800 --> 13:30.320
The second is more or less what you were pointing to yourself at the beginning there, which is the

13:30.320 --> 13:37.360
most radical one, which is essentially to deny the existence of reality, or at least to deny the

13:37.360 --> 13:44.480
existence of something that is mathematically precise and that pre-exists our observations,

13:45.040 --> 13:52.560
to make this incredibly radical move that says that we can calculate the probability of what our

13:52.560 --> 13:58.000
observations will be, and we can then make them, and when we see them they're real,

13:58.000 --> 14:03.760
but there was no such thing as what they were before we observed them. There was only this

14:03.760 --> 14:09.920
instrumentalist kind of calculation, and weirdly, even though that is clearly the most radical and

14:09.920 --> 14:16.720
hard to really wrap your brain around, that's the one that came first. That's the more or less

14:16.720 --> 14:22.400
what Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg would have advocated, you know, a completely epistemic

14:22.400 --> 14:28.560
instrumental approach to thinking about quantum mechanics. Whereas the third option I would give

14:28.560 --> 14:36.160
you is a happy medium, where you say there's the wave function, and that's it. There is nothing else,

14:36.160 --> 14:41.840
and the wave function does not collapse, and there are no extra variables, and the Schrodinger

14:41.840 --> 14:47.200
equation, which tells you how the wave function evolves, is always true, just like Newton's laws

14:47.200 --> 14:53.600
were always true in classical mechanics. And the crucially important thing to make that viable

14:54.240 --> 14:59.440
is because when we look at things, like I said, we don't see the wave function, so if it's what is

14:59.440 --> 15:06.720
real, why don't we see it? And the answer is that we have a wave function ourselves, and we have

15:06.720 --> 15:13.840
superpositions of who we are, and they all exist, but the we that does the observing and the

15:13.840 --> 15:20.240
experiencing is only a tiny, tiny fraction of what is going on in the whole wave function,

15:20.240 --> 15:28.320
so we call this many worlds. And it is on the one hand the most simple and straightforward working

15:28.320 --> 15:32.720
version of quantum mechanics. On the other hand, it makes you a little bit dizzy to think that all

15:32.720 --> 15:38.560
these different worlds are coming into being. And I would put super determinism and Sabina's

15:38.560 --> 15:44.960
theories, which come from other people also, as a fourth category, which is even wackier

15:44.960 --> 15:47.840
than the ones that I've told you about, but we can talk about them if you want.

15:47.840 --> 15:54.720
Yeah. Thanks very much. Listen to me. Okay. My first story to go on in this police

15:54.720 --> 16:05.440
style, my problem is the standard reproach that I hear and read about many worlds is that

16:06.400 --> 16:15.280
it's one cannot even imagine how to test it with today's knowledge. That it's just an empty

16:15.280 --> 16:24.800
hypothesis. It resolves such many paradoxes, blah, blah. But with today's knowledge, we cannot get a

16:24.800 --> 16:34.400
clear test. Good. That's wrong. But you do hear it a lot. Yeah. Please. Go on. I'm sorry. It depends

16:34.480 --> 16:39.440
on what you mean by test and we have to get very carefully into the philosophy of science here,

16:39.440 --> 16:49.200
right? For two reasons. If what you mean by test is just the very naive falsifiability kind of

16:49.200 --> 16:54.320
idea that Karl Popper would have put forward, right? Can you rule out the theory by doing some

16:54.320 --> 17:00.720
experiment? Then the answer is clearly and straightforwardly yes, because the theory just

17:00.720 --> 17:05.680
says that there is a wave function and all it ever does is obey this particular equation.

17:06.240 --> 17:11.520
So if you ever see the wave function not obeying that equation, you have ruled out the theory. You

17:11.520 --> 17:17.200
have falsified it. And there are I didn't mention, but there are other versions of quantum mechanics

17:17.200 --> 17:25.280
that predict exactly that in a very quantitative and testable way. So far, what we call the objective

17:25.360 --> 17:31.520
collapse of the wave function has not been observed in experiment. But as soon as we do

17:31.520 --> 17:37.120
observe it, if that ever happens, we will rule out many worlds. Sorry to interrupt,

17:37.120 --> 17:43.680
but when you say has not been observed, so you don't buy this simplistic materialist,

17:43.680 --> 17:50.000
I also don't buy it version, which says that no problem collects happens all the time in

17:50.000 --> 17:56.400
reality and so on. And you try to define registration or decoherence in a totally

17:56.400 --> 18:03.280
objective way. You don't buy this. Well, I am super duper materialist. But I think that the

18:03.280 --> 18:08.080
only thing the wave function ever does is obey the Schrodinger equation. It does not collapse

18:08.080 --> 18:14.800
all by itself. So the alternatives, there are there's sort of sub degrees within this materialist,

18:14.800 --> 18:20.720
physicalist camp. People like me think it's the Schrodinger equation from start to finish.

18:20.720 --> 18:26.000
And what we perceive as collapses are only apparent, because we're not seeing the whole

18:26.000 --> 18:31.440
story. There are other people like Roger Penrose or others who think that the wave function

18:31.440 --> 18:37.760
violates the Schrodinger equation by suddenly collapsing on itself. I think it's very, very

18:37.840 --> 18:44.880
difficult to actually define a theory that works along those lines, but it does have the

18:44.880 --> 18:49.680
nice quality that it's very, very testable, and it's very, very different in its predictions

18:49.680 --> 18:55.760
from what many worlds is. Okay, now there's the other- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please. I will

18:55.760 --> 19:00.160
discipline myself. Finish, please. There's the other even more subtle philosophy of science

19:00.160 --> 19:06.560
question, which is, okay, but what about many worlds versus the Copenhagen interpretation or

19:06.560 --> 19:12.400
Bohmian mechanics or something like that? And these are all very tricky, worthwhile asking

19:12.400 --> 19:20.320
questions. My answer is the following. The problem with Copenhagen versus many worlds is that Copenhagen

19:20.320 --> 19:26.800
is not a theory. It is not precise. It does not tell you when wave functions collapse,

19:26.800 --> 19:33.200
what a measurement is, what qualifies as a measuring apparatus. It's not that I can't test

19:33.280 --> 19:40.640
it. It doesn't even tell me what the predictions are or what the ontology is. So if you're comparing

19:40.640 --> 19:45.280
many worlds to Copenhagen, it's not a fair fight because one theory is well-defined and the other

19:45.280 --> 19:51.600
one isn't. It is true that as far as I know, they have no difference in terms of experimental

19:51.600 --> 19:57.840
predictions, but they have huge differences in terms of being well-defined. Whereas with

19:58.400 --> 20:04.160
pi-the-wave theories, Bohmian mechanics, hidden variable theories, those are well-defined.

20:05.040 --> 20:11.680
I would like to be able to distinguish many worlds from them. I have a deep suspicion that

20:11.680 --> 20:18.320
they are experimentally distinguishable, but nobody has actually pinpointed what that difference is.

20:18.320 --> 20:22.960
So that is, to me, an open question. I think that there's a lot of Bohmians who think that

20:22.960 --> 20:27.440
their predictions are exactly the same as many worlds. I suspect they've not just been trying

20:27.440 --> 20:35.200
hard enough. Okay, now I will try to be more precise. I agree with you. There isn't even one

20:36.880 --> 20:43.120
about Niels Bohr. There is even one very vicious, but I like vicious,

20:43.120 --> 20:50.720
formulation's point that it repeats almost that the basic formula of Copenhagen interpretation is

20:50.720 --> 21:01.280
don't think just calculate. Don't even ask these questions. Okay, let me go step by step. My

21:01.280 --> 21:10.960
problem with many worlds is that the way you put it, I would love this. The only wave oscillations

21:10.960 --> 21:17.680
collapse is something that appears, blah blah blah, but isn't in some sense, although

21:18.640 --> 21:24.400
when I say in some sense, I don't mean it in a precise scientific sense, but it seems to me that

21:26.880 --> 21:34.160
many worlds interpretation simply multiplies realities. We lose a special, everything is true

21:34.880 --> 21:42.080
in the sense of all possible variations are true. So what I, and in some sense,

21:42.800 --> 21:50.880
what fascinates me, the ontological incompleteness, again disappears. Everything is fully there.

21:50.880 --> 21:58.080
The problem is our limited standpoint. Am I missing something here?

21:59.120 --> 22:03.680
Yeah, so I'm happy about this one because you are missing something and I can, I can, I can help a

22:03.680 --> 22:09.920
little bit. I like you. Yeah, yeah. So two, again, two points worth making. One is that

22:10.000 --> 22:18.560
it is certainly not true that within many worlds, every possibility exists. It's very easy to

22:18.560 --> 22:24.080
to point to possible worlds that don't come into existence. What, what many world says after all is

22:24.080 --> 22:30.160
that we obey the Schrodinger equation. And that implies a lot. For example, electric charge is

22:30.160 --> 22:37.120
conserved. I can imagine a world where a proton spontaneously turns into an electron. There is

22:37.120 --> 22:41.920
no such world in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. There are many, many

22:41.920 --> 22:49.120
imaginable worlds that just don't come to be. The second issue, which is much more subtle and

22:49.120 --> 22:54.800
worth, you know, you're allowed to disagree with many worlds on this one is many worlds not only

22:54.800 --> 23:02.800
says here's the bunch of worlds. It says that the worlds don't count equally. That there is a weight

23:02.800 --> 23:08.480
or a thickness to them. And that helps explain why in quantum mechanics,

23:08.480 --> 23:12.640
you predict there's a probability for X or a probability for Y, but the probability for X

23:12.640 --> 23:20.320
is 99%. And the probability for Y is 1%. And that's a crucially important part of many worlds

23:20.320 --> 23:25.440
that you don't necessarily get if you're just thinking about David Lewis and possible worlds

23:25.440 --> 23:31.040
or something like that, right? Many worlds on defies how big the worlds are. And that's crucially

23:31.040 --> 23:38.160
important. But now I would like my police instinct to gain kind comes into action.

23:38.720 --> 23:46.640
When you say how big worlds are, is this ontological category in the sense that some

23:46.640 --> 23:54.000
worlds are sorry to use this term, you can explode in some sense more substantially real

23:54.000 --> 24:02.560
than others? Or can you specify a little bit more, this idea of more and less,

24:02.560 --> 24:10.720
whichever way you name it, big or strong worlds? Well, you know, and I do say the

24:10.720 --> 24:15.600
following thing often and always makes me feel bad. But this is something where if we write down

24:15.600 --> 24:22.480
the equations, it's crystal clear. In words, it's hard. But the answer is that it's not that one

24:22.480 --> 24:28.560
world is more real than another. They're both real. Let's let's get take the 99% versus 1%

24:28.560 --> 24:35.680
example. They're both real. But the way it works out is if you don't know the outcome of the

24:35.680 --> 24:40.000
experiment, so you do the experiment, you make the observation and you haven't looked yet.

24:40.640 --> 24:50.000
So maybe you're in the 99% world, maybe you're in the 1% world, right? The impact of this

24:50.000 --> 24:56.240
calculation, which is completely quantitative, is that you should assign a credence of 0.99

24:56.240 --> 25:02.000
to being in the 99% world and a credence of 0.01 to being in the 1% world.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
So they're both real, but you're not equally likely to find yourself in them.

25:07.040 --> 25:14.800
What I still don't get and sorry, I, although I'm totally opposed like you to that

25:14.800 --> 25:22.560
hidden variables in the sense of there is one single substantial reality, that's what I still

25:22.560 --> 25:36.160
don't get here. Okay, Schrodinger equation said 99% blah blah. Then I agree with you because of our

25:36.160 --> 25:46.000
limited standpoint, something happens. Why insist that parallel or I don't like the word

25:46.000 --> 25:56.560
parallel is too physical, that at the same time, another reality exists, alternate. What do you,

25:56.560 --> 26:03.680
what do you gain by this? Nobody wants this to be the case. Nobody is insisting that both

26:03.680 --> 26:09.120
worlds are there. That is the prediction of the Schrodinger equation. And the question is,

26:09.120 --> 26:16.000
you can either accept it, like I think of what Hugh Everett did as more therapeutic. He was a

26:16.000 --> 26:22.800
joclican of physics. He wasn't writing down new equations. He was just saying, here are the equations,

26:22.800 --> 26:30.880
here are their implications, you have to deal with it. Or you can modify the theory, you can do

26:30.880 --> 26:36.800
violence to the Schrodinger equation to get rid of the other world if that makes you feel better.

26:37.680 --> 26:41.360
And you're welcome to try to do that. That's basically what the hidden variables people

26:41.360 --> 26:46.560
are trying to do. They're trying to invent a finger that points to one world and says,

26:46.560 --> 26:50.960
here's the one we're actually in. The others are there, but there's only one that we're actually

26:50.960 --> 26:55.840
in. That's why David Deutsch, for example, says that hidden variable peoples are just

26:55.840 --> 27:00.480
many world's people in denial, because they know the other worlds are there, they don't want to

27:00.480 --> 27:09.920
live in that. I like the Hegel formulations, because back to, okay, back to the opposite vision,

27:09.920 --> 27:19.760
back to Niels Bohr. I was surprised at how, at some level, he is ultra commonsense,

27:19.760 --> 27:27.360
really. Doesn't he repeatedly say, all that we can observe, all that exists out there is our

27:27.360 --> 27:34.320
common reality. Everything that we measure, it shows on the screen, we're measuring apparatus in

27:34.320 --> 27:41.760
our common reality. So, he insists that all these wave function formulas and so on, they have no

27:41.760 --> 27:49.040
ontological status in the sense that we have to presuppose another type of reality.

27:49.120 --> 27:56.240
He insists that it's simply, and here he escapes, I think, too easily into some kind of

27:56.880 --> 28:03.360
naive epistemological reason. He says, these are just our mathematical means, formulas, or sometimes

28:03.360 --> 28:12.320
he even says language symbolic fictions to account for how did we come from A to B, but both A and

28:12.320 --> 28:23.200
B are firmly here. So, does he ever try to make a step further? I know I will be very precise here,

28:23.200 --> 28:28.880
I'm not, I'm laughing, but not substantially, because what would then in this view prove,

28:29.920 --> 28:37.440
I, of course, follow this with fascination, the, these years you remember the three guys,

28:38.400 --> 28:46.160
the old French one, Alain Aspect, and the Zeilinger, an Austrian man, and the third one is American,

28:46.160 --> 28:55.920
I think, or whatever, no. What did they really prove? Isn't, nonetheless, in what they say,

28:56.560 --> 29:04.320
a little bit more realist tendency, that in some sense, there must be a level of

29:04.880 --> 29:13.760
reality, which work reality, whatever you call it out there, that works in a different way from our

29:13.760 --> 29:23.680
ordinary reality. Another thing, usually what they did is, with these experiments, is usually read as

29:24.400 --> 29:34.480
Bol's victory against Einstein. But isn't it more complex, because they didn't prove that there is no,

29:36.240 --> 29:43.680
that there is pure contingency, no. They only proved that if you go to Particle A, this then the

29:43.680 --> 29:51.440
correlated Particle B down up, but this only means that there is no link at the level of speed of

29:51.520 --> 29:58.640
light or lower. There still can be a link at the higher level, higher, okay, outside, no?

29:59.760 --> 30:05.840
Exactly, that's exactly right. Bohr has his, you know, I don't read a lot of Niels Bohr,

30:05.840 --> 30:11.600
he's famously hard to understand, but he has his modern avatars, right, there are people alive right

30:11.600 --> 30:18.880
now, who very much think that reality does not pre-exist our measurement outcomes. And as you

30:18.880 --> 30:24.240
imply, Einstein, as well as Schrodinger for that matter, were very much on the other side. They

30:24.240 --> 30:31.040
were very much physicalists, materialists, they wanted to see the mechanisms behind what was

30:31.040 --> 30:38.160
going on before we made our observations. The problem that they had, as you're pointing to, is that

30:38.160 --> 30:45.760
they had a, you know, Einstein invented relativity. He thought that spacetime was very fundamental

30:45.760 --> 30:52.560
and the speed of light was absolute. So what he pointed out in the famous EPR paper, Einstein,

30:52.560 --> 30:59.440
Podolsky and Rosen, is that quantum mechanics, but maybe the audience doesn't, so I'm trying to be

30:59.440 --> 31:08.560
careful. You know, quantum mechanics seems, he said, to be incomplete with any kind of underlying

31:08.560 --> 31:14.640
theory that would take locality seriously, the idea that not only is there space and time,

31:14.640 --> 31:21.360
but things that exist have locations in space and time and things that interact

31:21.360 --> 31:26.640
do so at the same point of space and time. And Einstein says quantum mechanics seems to be

31:26.640 --> 31:34.880
incompatible with that. And John Bell proved a theorem saying, yes, it truly is incompatible

31:34.880 --> 31:41.920
with that. And then the people who measured their correlated photons, their entangled photons,

31:42.000 --> 31:51.200
Ospey, Klauser and Zeilinger, verified that Bell was correct, that you cannot reproduce the

31:51.200 --> 31:58.640
predictions that we observe in the real world with any naively locally realist theory.

31:58.640 --> 32:02.400
But only locally, no? Only locally. It must be locally.

32:02.400 --> 32:08.560
Only locally, exactly. So even the, amusingly, even the Nobel Committee got this wrong in their

32:08.560 --> 32:13.520
press release. They said that these experiments ruled out hidden variable theories, but that's

32:13.520 --> 32:18.960
just false. They ruled out local hidden variable theories. Because this was my first reaction.

32:18.960 --> 32:24.240
Sorry, it doesn't rule out all hidden variables, just those operating locally.

32:25.520 --> 32:33.600
In fact, just to, you know, make the story more amusing, John Bell was motivated by the fact that

32:33.600 --> 32:38.960
David Bohm had written down a non-local hidden variable theory that was very successful. And

32:38.960 --> 32:45.120
Bell really liked Bohm's theory, and he asked himself, is it, you know, Bohm's theory is clearly

32:45.120 --> 32:51.520
manifestly non-local? Is that a necessary quality, or can we get rid of it? And what you proved is,

32:51.520 --> 32:54.640
you cannot get rid of it. It's necessary if you want to match the data.

32:55.200 --> 33:06.400
But again, here, first, sorry, let me return for a brief moment to Neil's board. I hope we

33:06.400 --> 33:12.800
are both here on the materialist side in the sense that what I worry is not so much this

33:13.360 --> 33:21.120
direct new age spiritual reappropriation if I were to be a ruler of a Stalinist empire.

33:21.120 --> 33:27.360
If you say, as I read somewhere, some Indian idiot, not Native American, India said,

33:27.360 --> 33:33.360
oh, but all the Xilinger and those guys proved is not we Indians know from Upanishads, from

33:33.360 --> 33:39.280
Bhagavad, you know all that bullshit. Even the movie, I haven't seen it, but it didn't prevent me to

33:39.280 --> 33:46.080
write the review of it. Oppenheimer goes into this, you know, all those voting Bhagavad Gita,

33:46.080 --> 33:54.000
and the destroyer of the world, whatever. So even, even the board was not clear here.

33:54.000 --> 34:01.200
When he, when he, what's his principle? Sorry, I'm so confused now of

34:02.560 --> 34:12.320
complementarity, yeah? He had this tendency to falsely universalize it in a pseudo-spiritualist

34:12.320 --> 34:19.760
way. For example, he said, it's not just particles, it's also, he said, to the Bible,

34:19.760 --> 34:26.720
then, then wisdom versus knowledge and all that bullshit and so on. So this is where we need,

34:26.720 --> 34:34.160
we materialists, intellectual police, no? We need some agency to say the moment you mention this,

34:34.160 --> 34:39.200
do you know what I give you here, one-way ticket, first class to Bulak for 10 years,

34:39.600 --> 34:46.800
no, but seriously, isn't this, that's why also quantum, why quantum physics interests me,

34:46.800 --> 34:54.640
because precisely because it breaks the confines of our ordinary notion of reality,

34:55.360 --> 35:02.880
it is always exposed to this pseudo-spiritualist danger. So my,

35:03.280 --> 35:12.800
my problem here is, I read this and I learn also from people like you that,

35:13.360 --> 35:20.960
that golden era of Copenhagen shut up, daunting, calculate is over. We are returning to what

35:21.520 --> 35:29.440
traditionally is called ontological, metaphysical questions. My temptation is, and please tell

35:29.520 --> 35:38.960
me from what you know, am I totally wrong or not? If I, you know what vacillates me in this

35:38.960 --> 35:49.120
Bell's theorem, no? What if this element of maybe even contingency is not the right term, just this

35:50.480 --> 35:57.840
openness, not full determinism and so on, are we back with many worlds in

35:58.480 --> 36:05.920
determinism or do, is this openness of the universe maintained? Wonderful idea for me that

36:05.920 --> 36:12.800
you know, even if you look at details, details, no, it's not. You discover deep at some point,

36:12.800 --> 36:19.200
reality is blank, open. I would like as a philosopher for non-scientific interest to

36:19.200 --> 36:25.200
save this, hit me. I mean, with counter. I think that two things, you know, your, your,

36:25.200 --> 36:32.720
your characterization of Bohr is right on. Not only was his philosophy of quantum mechanics

36:32.720 --> 36:38.560
a little bit fuzzy, with not defining what he meant by measurement and whatever, but he did,

36:38.560 --> 36:48.240
you know, unabashedly connected to ideas from ancient eastern wisdom and complementarity.

36:48.240 --> 36:51.920
And you were doing this, I thought you were trying to only come in him. Even eastern wisdom,

36:51.920 --> 36:56.800
he was already dead. Oh, yes. Oh, my God. He was. And not to anyone's benefit.

36:56.800 --> 37:03.520
But out of police when we take power. Right. But the determinism question is a much trickier one,

37:03.520 --> 37:08.400
because then, I mean, just so everyone knows in the background here, so, you know, quantum

37:08.400 --> 37:12.880
mechanics came on the scene in the 1920s and 30s with the Copenhagen interpretation and whatever.

37:13.840 --> 37:21.760
It was in the 1950s that people like Bohm and Everett finally wrote down 100% physical

37:21.840 --> 37:27.600
material versions of quantum mechanics that fit the data completely well. The physics community

37:28.400 --> 37:33.680
could not care less. They just ignored it. They go on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you care about this,

37:33.680 --> 37:38.000
you're not going to get a job. You'll be kicked out of the field. But we know. You can't now say.

37:38.000 --> 37:43.600
Bohm also a political one. He was very left leaning with. That's right. He was kicked out of the

37:43.600 --> 37:48.000
country, not only of the field. Ever left the field by himself. But he picked out a few different

37:48.000 --> 37:54.320
reasons. Yeah. Not because of quantum mechanics. No, no, because of his point. Yeah. But, you know,

37:54.320 --> 38:01.840
yeah, so there's there and there are still people today who will, who will be, are you in favor

38:01.840 --> 38:08.960
of idealism on the basis of quantum mechanics that we have to put consciousness. Sorry.

38:08.960 --> 38:13.760
It should be. Isn't sorry for Roger Penrose approaching death a little bit.

38:14.400 --> 38:18.480
Maybe a little bit. A little bit. But at least, yeah. But I think, you know, there are some people

38:18.480 --> 38:24.000
who will simply deny the existence of objective reality and put mind and agents at the center of

38:24.000 --> 38:28.960
everything. That's one thing. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe that's right. Maybe it's wrong. But my point is,

38:28.960 --> 38:34.800
quantum mechanics doesn't force you in that direction. There's perfectly mechanistic versions

38:34.880 --> 38:43.760
that fit the data perfectly well. But so, so again, your answer to this mega reproach from Einstein,

38:43.760 --> 38:52.000
Janssen, Savine, Rosenfelder, and so on, that quantum mechanics describes, it's very simple

38:52.000 --> 38:58.880
reproach. I just repeated for the viewers, describes a certain universe, which is in itself

38:58.960 --> 39:07.520
consistent wave function, blah, blah. But it cannot account in its own terms of the,

39:08.400 --> 39:15.760
our ordinary reality measuring, and so on, and so on. In, if I read you correctly,

39:16.480 --> 39:22.880
many worlds does this in some sense. Yes. Yeah, exactly. So I think, you know, I forgot, you

39:22.880 --> 39:29.520
also mentioned determinism, which is a crucial point here, which again, physicists don't agree on.

39:29.520 --> 39:36.800
So for both hidden variable theories, boom, by the waves, etc., and for many worlds, you're in a

39:36.800 --> 39:45.040
situation where the underlying equations and dynamics are 100% deterministic. Laplace would

39:45.040 --> 39:50.240
have been happy. Laplace's demon could predict everything that happens. But in both theories,

39:50.240 --> 39:56.240
there is some epistemic uncertainty. There is some subjective probability that comes in.

39:56.240 --> 40:00.000
In the case of hidden variables, it's because you don't know where the hidden variables are.

40:00.800 --> 40:04.720
In the case of many worlds, it's because all these different branches exist, and you don't

40:04.720 --> 40:12.320
know which branch you are on. So there's the appearance of indeterminism, because you cannot,

40:12.320 --> 40:17.360
even if you know the wave function of the universe perfectly, you still can't predict the outcomes

40:17.360 --> 40:22.480
of your next experiment. So it's a weird in-between ground. You know what I would like to do? Now,

40:22.480 --> 40:33.200
this is a pure abstract, in a bad sense, philosopher speaking through me now. I would just like to

40:33.200 --> 40:42.000
elevate into, as you may have guessed, into ontological status to put into reality itself

40:42.000 --> 40:48.320
this element of uncertainty. Can't we say, while keeping sure the equation and so on that,

40:48.320 --> 40:55.840
and that's for me the mega greatness of quantum physics, that there is an element of uncertainty

40:56.720 --> 41:04.320
which is not just epistemological, but which is in itself. Isn't this also implied in what you said,

41:04.320 --> 41:14.400
99%, 1%, it's not that we don't know. It's in reality itself, in some sense, because it's

41:14.400 --> 41:24.880
99%, 1%, and so on. You don't like this idea. Yeah, I am honestly, I know that you told me to just

41:24.880 --> 41:30.000
say the truth and not say that I'm not sure about my opinions being true or false. This is a good area

41:30.000 --> 41:37.440
where it's okay to be a little uncertain. I would say that in the many worlds point of view,

41:38.480 --> 41:46.720
we're faced with a novel, unique metaphysical challenge, because like I said, we can know

41:46.720 --> 41:52.560
everything about the universe and still not make a prediction. And the reason why is because

41:52.640 --> 41:59.440
that 99% world and the 1% world are both going to become true. And there will be a

42:00.400 --> 42:07.680
future version of me in each of those worlds. And there's no unique, it's not even sensible to ask

42:07.680 --> 42:12.480
which one of them am I going to be. They're both going to be in there in existence. They're both

42:12.480 --> 42:18.160
going to have all of my memories, right? This is utterly unprecedented in physics or philosophy.

42:18.160 --> 42:24.320
So I claim that the way to distinguish it is to say that both of those future selves are real

42:24.320 --> 42:30.080
people, but they're in positions of self locating uncertainty, indexical uncertainty. There's

42:30.080 --> 42:35.600
something they don't know, which is where they are in the universe, which branch of the wave

42:35.600 --> 42:44.000
function they're on. And it's perfectly deterministic, underlying dynamics, but a new situation in

42:44.000 --> 42:49.440
which there's no univalent you that can ask questions about the universe. There's many

42:49.440 --> 42:58.160
different future versions of you. This nonetheless reminds me of problems that emerge even with

42:58.160 --> 43:06.240
Descartes, Kogito in modern philosophy, where here I see the actuality of Descartes. Yes,

43:06.320 --> 43:13.840
universe is mechanistic and so on, but I cannot locate myself into it deterministically.

43:14.720 --> 43:21.600
This is the big enigma, I think, in some sense of the entire modern philosophy.

43:24.000 --> 43:29.520
I recently did a podcast with Robinson, with David Albert, who is another very well-accomplished

43:29.520 --> 43:35.040
philosopher of science. And we talked about the fact that there is an analogous situation

43:35.120 --> 43:39.920
that also comes up with the multiverse, not the many worlds of quantum mechanics, but the

43:39.920 --> 43:44.960
cosmological multiverse, where we imagine that just very, very far away, there's many different

43:44.960 --> 43:50.880
observers and so forth. And philosophy is just not currently up to the task of dealing with this,

43:50.880 --> 43:57.440
I think. It needs to get better, but how do you evaluate questions like,

43:58.160 --> 44:04.000
what would a typical observer see in this ensemble? And should I care about that question,

44:04.000 --> 44:09.440
because I am not a typical observer. Should I reason as if I were typical? Cosmologists

44:09.440 --> 44:15.200
bless their hearts. They think the right thing to do is to reason as if they were a typical

44:15.200 --> 44:20.640
observer in the universe, even though they know perfectly well that they're not. So they go through

44:20.640 --> 44:25.760
this weird thing where they say, okay, I'm going to forget everything I know about my actual situation.

44:26.320 --> 44:30.640
I'm going to pretend I was a typical observer. I'm going to make predictions. I'm going to open

44:30.640 --> 44:36.640
my eyes and go, oh, this is very surprising. But we can do better than that and we don't do yet.

44:37.600 --> 44:42.400
But you see, now we don't have time to go into it, but this is another

44:42.400 --> 44:50.400
metaphysical topic that fascinates me. Why? And often, for me, deterministic philosophers get

44:50.400 --> 44:57.360
caught into this. You want to be as realistic as possible, but to formulate your position,

44:57.360 --> 45:03.760
you have to pause at an impossible point of subjectivity, where you see an all-universal

45:03.760 --> 45:10.400
observer and so on and so on. What tempts me, but I don't have, of course, not a scientific

45:10.400 --> 45:21.920
formula here, is, but okay, let's return to many worlds. But you think that, but doesn't

45:22.000 --> 45:29.760
Schrodinger equation, equation, just give probabilities from what will happen now,

45:29.760 --> 45:34.720
like 99% this happens, okay, everything happens. I got your point.

45:36.080 --> 45:41.520
Yeah, so not everything happens, but something's happened and something's happened more than others.

45:41.520 --> 45:47.440
So, you know, I think that this is the challenge, because if you're a many worlds person,

45:47.440 --> 45:51.360
you do think that the Schrodinger equation is all there is. And let me back up just a second

45:51.360 --> 45:56.640
to make it even a little bit more reasonable. If you believe in quantum mechanics at all,

45:57.680 --> 46:05.680
and you want to be realist at all, right, so then you will have to say that the electron

46:05.680 --> 46:10.720
that can be spinning clockwise or spinning counterclockwise, quantum mechanics says it

46:10.720 --> 46:17.040
could be in a superposition, right? It truly is some combination of spinning clockwise and

46:17.040 --> 46:22.320
spinning counterclockwise. And so if you believe that that can be physically true, not just a

46:22.320 --> 46:27.840
state of our knowledge or prediction, then you should be able to believe that the whole universe

46:27.840 --> 46:34.320
can be in a superposition of many different possibilities. So you're not asking for anything

46:34.320 --> 46:40.480
more by becoming a many worlds person, all the possibilities were always there in the

46:41.440 --> 46:48.320
quantum mechanics. All of the new challenges are philosophical. How do I deal with the fact

46:48.320 --> 46:53.360
that there are many people like me with exactly the same epistemic states? How do I make predictions

46:53.360 --> 46:57.440
of what they're going to see when they open their eyes and things like that? It is a radically

46:57.440 --> 47:03.040
different view of the world, maybe not as radical as the view that says that there is no reality,

47:03.040 --> 47:06.880
but still pretty darn radical. And I think the quantum mechanics forces us to be radical one

47:06.880 --> 47:17.840
way or another. I see, I see. Okay, let me move it connect. You know what fascinates me? Now I move

47:17.840 --> 47:28.080
into my own speculations about philosophy language and so on. I like so much the notion of superposition

47:28.880 --> 47:34.720
because I think I will try to put it in very simple terms, but it's a more complex theory.

47:35.040 --> 47:43.600
A guy who teaches French guy who I think, is he Stanford or Santa Cruz? Did you hear the name

47:43.600 --> 47:49.680
Jean Pierre Dupuis, D-U-P-U-Y, a French theory. A very familiar but not an expert, yes.

47:53.760 --> 48:02.080
Tried to introduce, but without any bluffing about quantum physics, the notion of superposition

48:02.640 --> 48:12.320
into historical processes and knowledges. I will give you an extremely simplified example.

48:13.440 --> 48:20.880
Let's say today we are in an, I will go even specifically, Russia put in Ukraine war.

48:22.400 --> 48:30.080
Again, maybe it's already decided in the terms of the Schrodinger equation 99%, but we don't

48:30.080 --> 48:37.680
know what, that there will be global war or not. But his idea is this one. And again, this is pure

48:38.320 --> 48:47.440
speculation, more pertaining to human language. Is that in our human, human universe, I'm here

48:47.440 --> 48:53.760
often referred maybe to that famous quote from T.S. Eliot, who was an idealist conservative, but

48:53.760 --> 49:04.080
others, he put it nicely that every new invention, really new in art, in some sense also changes the

49:04.080 --> 49:11.760
entire past. It makes it readable in a different way. So Dupuis interpretation against these lines

49:11.760 --> 49:21.360
would be, let's say that in two, three years, there will be world war three. Then automatically,

49:21.360 --> 49:28.560
we will retroactively read it as it was clear all the time that this should happen. We just

49:28.560 --> 49:37.360
had illusions that we can avoid it. Let's say that world war three will not happen. Then we will

49:37.360 --> 49:46.080
have the way we read today, the Cold War. No, yes, it was danger, but somehow we avoided it and so

49:46.080 --> 49:53.440
on and so on. But Dupuis point that I like is that it's not enough to say that these were just

49:53.440 --> 50:02.320
different possibilities, options. It's a stronger term. It's in the sense that if something happens,

50:02.960 --> 50:11.280
it, of course, it doesn't restructure the past in its brutal reality. But the whole symbolic

50:11.280 --> 50:17.680
constellation of how we read the past page. And this now I could go on here for hours. I love

50:17.680 --> 50:24.960
these examples. That's why I am not, and I think in my crazy way, I got this lesson from one of

50:24.960 --> 50:37.440
these mechanics. I am not, I totally reject this stupid historicist view to understand Shakespeare.

50:37.440 --> 50:46.640
You must study in detail Elizabethan era and so on. I would say first the opposite. To understand

50:46.640 --> 50:56.400
Elizabethan era rejects, you will learn more. But more seriously, you know, for me, really great works

50:56.400 --> 51:05.760
of art are precisely the ones which cannot be limited to a specific historical constellation.

51:06.240 --> 51:13.440
Every new epoch reinvents them. For example, with Shakespeare. Many people don't know, but immediately

51:13.440 --> 51:20.560
after his death, it was the horrible era of Racine and all those strange guys, classicists, and

51:20.560 --> 51:26.560
Shakespeare was considered vulgar. Only through romanticism, Shakespeare was reinvented. And I

51:26.560 --> 51:38.000
love these paradoxes. How sometimes precisely not knowing all the context of Shakespeare historical,

51:38.000 --> 51:45.760
you can propose a reading which is much more convincing. And it's not simply an external

51:45.760 --> 51:51.520
reading. Again, I'm back to my point about openness. It is as if, which is obvious,

51:52.320 --> 51:58.560
Shakespeare didn't really know what he is doing. You know, which is here my wonderful example. You

51:58.560 --> 52:04.960
know that it's attributed to Lincoln, but I read somewhere that he was not really the first to

52:04.960 --> 52:09.600
say that, you know, you can treat some of the people all the time, all the people

52:10.720 --> 52:17.120
sometime, but you cannot treat all the people all of the time. This is a deeply ambiguous statement.

52:17.200 --> 52:26.080
It can mean there are some idiots who can be treated all the time, some the same, or it can mean

52:26.080 --> 52:32.640
in one situation, I will be the idiot in another situation, you or you. You see, this is for me

52:32.640 --> 52:40.960
how language is structured. It is open. The author himself is not a possessor of some hidden meaning.

52:40.960 --> 52:47.600
That's why my favorite example is, you know, where Shakespeare, for me, the best cinema version

52:47.600 --> 52:57.520
of Shakespeare Hamlet is Kurosawa in 62 in Japan, did a version of Hamlet with a wonderful title,

52:57.520 --> 53:04.240
Only Evil People Sleep Good, which is a deep truth, you know, real evil people don't care. They

53:04.560 --> 53:11.680
they're not haunted. And again, it's set in modern Japan, Hamlet is a student returns to

53:11.680 --> 53:18.240
Tokyo from United. But what I'm saying is you see what I'm aiming at. This I or I'll give you

53:18.240 --> 53:25.200
another classical example. I remember from the Puy this quote, you are too young, call to be some

53:25.200 --> 53:33.520
23 years ago, there was a presidential candidate in France, Edouard Balladur, who say, but when

53:33.520 --> 53:42.240
there were some pre-elections in Le Monde, there was a wonderful comment saying, if Balladur will

53:42.240 --> 53:50.640
win next election, his victory will be necessary. You know the paradox, after something happens,

53:50.640 --> 54:00.880
it becomes retroactively necessary. And now you see where I am aiming at. I'm desperately looking,

54:01.680 --> 54:07.680
but you almost converted me, I will have to work more in quantum physics for some kind of

54:08.400 --> 54:19.280
ontological foundation of this openness that I like this idea of retroactive determinism. And I

54:19.280 --> 54:24.240
will give you the ultimate social proof. This is not physics at all. But I love it.

54:24.880 --> 54:32.960
A protestantism. People don't notice this obvious paradox. Weber, protestant, ethics,

54:32.960 --> 54:40.160
origin of capitalism, blah, blah. But since if anything, capitalism is a system which

54:40.160 --> 54:46.800
pushes you to constant effort and so on, isn't it strange that you would have then expected

54:47.440 --> 54:54.960
that capitalism, sorry, protestantism would have been against, and this brings me back to your

54:54.960 --> 55:00.560
point in a very nice way, that capitalism would have been against predetermination. Because if

55:00.560 --> 55:06.080
everything is predetermined, why not my seat at home must await and watch Pornhub or whatever.

55:06.080 --> 55:16.560
It's already decided. But precisely capitalism, which is the most active system, needs predestination.

55:16.640 --> 55:23.120
Along what lines, along what you said, here I come back to you, here I will use you,

55:23.120 --> 55:30.320
when you said wonderfully, yes, setting an equation objectively valid, but with one small

55:30.320 --> 55:37.120
point, I don't know where I am in it. And that's protestantism in religion. You see now what I am

55:37.120 --> 55:44.000
aiming at, you know. But nonetheless, you know, let's go to the end in

55:44.880 --> 55:54.400
metaphysics. I see your point. But then what would be your answer to where

55:55.440 --> 56:02.800
does then our limitation, now I'm going back to you, there is an objective description,

56:02.800 --> 56:07.920
we can give it, we just don't know where we are. You don't think that

56:08.880 --> 56:18.720
how can, how can many words interpretation account for this uniqueness of us?

56:20.080 --> 56:29.520
Not uniqueness in any metaphysical sense, but how we are one unique, but still can arrive at this

56:29.520 --> 56:37.680
objective, as it were, view of this. So let me say two things. For me, how do you account for the

56:37.680 --> 56:42.240
subject itself? Him sense himself, I will not go into this bullshit now.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.600
So I'm happy we can solve these questions so easily in this podcast. It'll be very,

56:47.600 --> 56:55.200
very valuable to future generations. I'll say two things, one a little bit negative and one more

56:55.200 --> 57:03.920
constructive that the negative thing is, I am reluctant to think about quantum mechanics when

57:03.920 --> 57:09.680
I think about the uncertainty of human history, because there is a difference between quantum

57:09.680 --> 57:17.920
mechanics and probability or stochasticness, right? There's plenty of room for unpredictability

57:17.920 --> 57:22.560
in the world. In addition to what quantum mechanics gives us, what's special about

57:22.560 --> 57:29.040
quantum mechanics is that there's not just the probability, the probability is derived from

57:29.040 --> 57:35.360
this thing called the wave function, which distinguishes the idea that there's two possibilities,

57:35.360 --> 57:41.200
but we don't know which one is true, from the idea that there's really both possibilities

57:41.200 --> 57:47.040
at once. And I think that at least when it comes to human subjectivity and history,

57:47.120 --> 57:52.880
you don't need to imagine that all the possibilities are simultaneously physically true.

57:52.880 --> 57:58.720
You can just work with the fact that there's so much uncertainty and, excuse me,

57:58.720 --> 58:07.920
unpredictability in the real world, that we need a language of probability and computation and

58:07.920 --> 58:14.560
information to really make progress on these things. And it might involve the past in an

58:14.560 --> 58:21.120
intricate way. In fact, I'll reveal, I'll mention two funny things. One is, I recently did a podcast

58:21.120 --> 58:26.160
with Katie Elliott, who's a philosopher, and she made very much a similar point that you're

58:26.160 --> 58:32.720
making about Protestantism. We were talking about predestination and eternalism, and she said that

58:32.720 --> 58:38.240
she can make eternalism. She convinced herself that Calvinism was okay.

58:39.200 --> 58:44.560
I know, but this is the latest theory. It's no longer Luther, it's Calvinism, which is elevated.

58:46.480 --> 58:51.120
The problem with Calvinism is you're either blessed and going to go to heaven or you're not.

58:51.680 --> 58:58.320
But you never know. But you never know. So the worry, she points out, is very well known,

58:58.320 --> 59:04.240
is that, well, I can just act bad because I'm predestined to go to heaven or not. But what

59:04.320 --> 59:09.600
you don't understand is that God knows that you're going to act bad. And so if you act bad,

59:09.600 --> 59:14.560
you're bringing to reality the possibility that you're not going to go to heaven. So even though

59:14.560 --> 59:19.760
it is predestined, because you don't know, it is still in your best interest to act good.

59:20.960 --> 59:23.280
I know this thing, I forgot his name.

59:24.240 --> 59:34.640
My God, I forgot his name. Protestant, I'll put it back, whatever. Theodist, theologist,

59:34.640 --> 59:41.680
who is also known as the one who uses analytic philosophy. And he precisely in the terms of

59:41.680 --> 59:48.320
beyond the speed of light, he defended Protestantism because he said exactly what you said now.

59:49.280 --> 59:57.760
Like, if I'm predestined, why should I act good and so on? But again, God is beyond time.

59:57.760 --> 01:00:02.160
God knows how you will decide. Exactly. No, that's why it's...

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.960
It's like Newcombe's paradox. That's how we got into it. Yes, if you believe that there are

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:12.480
oracles that know about the future, you will behave differently than if you don't. But anyway,

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.920
the other thing I wanted to say, I wrote a short piece, a short essay that I published on my blog

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.760
years ago called, I hope you'll be amused by this, the universe is structured like a language.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.920
So somehow for me, I am universe, not unconscious, but universe.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.320
Not the unconscious. The universe is structured like a language. So I quote you and I quote

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:40.400
some quantum physicists. And the basic idea is that the universe evolves from

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:50.800
a very orderly, low entropy early state to very disorderly, messy future state. Along the way,

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.840
complex structures appear. This is the kind of thing that at the Santa Fe Institute,

01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:01.040
we're very interested in understanding. And the implication is that there...

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:07.040
Somewhere there in the laws of physics, in the laws of dynamics, in the way that we think about

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:12.800
how the universe marches forward, there exists the potential, the potentiality for

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:19.200
interesting complex things to happen. And even though they were not sort of embedded intrinsically

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:24.720
in the initial conditions, they came to be because of the structure of the dynamics along the way.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:31.440
And maybe quantum mechanics does play a role in that. This is all stuff that nobody claims to

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:40.720
understand very, very well. But if there's something computational or useful about complex

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:44.880
structures coming into existence, then that would be very nice to understand. And by the way,

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:51.520
by complex structures, I include you and me. Why did living beings come into existence,

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:56.400
even though the second law of thermodynamics says that the universe just rolls down to more

01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:03.200
and more disorder? And the suggested answer is that the way that you get to more and more disorder

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:09.440
is to pass through intricate, complicated things. And you can't predict very well which one they're

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:17.360
going to be. Can I now bombard you with my last big meta-physical point? Since I was told and you

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:26.720
indicated you also do cosmology and so on. Okay, to cut it thought directly to the thing.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:33.600
Is Big Bang theory out or not? Because I hear again and again that you can get that. I'm sorry.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:42.160
Traces of something that must have gone off before Big Bang and so on, all that stuff. So the idea is

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:48.240
almost a kind of Stalinist dialectical materialist visual of repeated Big Bang here,

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:56.000
collapses here, explodes there. Where do you stand here? So the sad thing is that the phrase

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.920
the Big Bang theory refers to two very different ideas at the same time. One is the whole history

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:11.040
of the universe from t equals zero to today, where it started hot and dense and it rapidly

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:17.520
expanded and galaxies and stars coalesced out of it. And the whole bit, the universe is approximately

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:24.640
14 billion years old, all of that. That story is just 100% solid. It's not going away. There was

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:30.400
just this week excitement on Twitter because someone claimed it was completely wrong, but they were

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:36.720
completely, they were themselves completely wrong. What can I tell you? There's so much evidence in

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:42.000
favor of this general picture, 14 billion years, et cetera, that we don't need to worry about that

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.920
being overturned by future experiments. Nobody wants to do this. They just claimed that there

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:52.720
must have been something other Big Bangs before. They don't say there is no Big Bang.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:58.480
Well, sadly, no, there are people who still think that even the story I just told you is wrong,

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:03.600
but then they're sadly misguided people. I'm just letting you know that you can find some

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:08.160
crazy claims that the universe is 30 billion years old or infinitely older. There's still people out

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:14.560
there who say those things. 6,000 also last Thursday. Yeah, these are all on the table.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:19.520
But now the harder question is that sometimes we use the phrase the Big Bang to refer to

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:26.160
just the moment t equals zero, right? Just the first moment. Forget about what happened after that,

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:31.760
but the actual event. Lots of nature, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's right. Now there,

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:38.320
the only honest thing we can say is we have no idea what happened. Physics is not up to the task

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:44.240
of saying whether there was truly a singularity, whether that was truly the beginning of the universe,

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:50.640
whether it was a bounce or a quantum nucleation event. All the options are on the table. I'm

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:56.080
responsible for some of the options. There's a picture. This picture right here is one of my

01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:02.480
favorite theories where the universe is infinitely old. So I think that the idea that the Big Bang

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:08.480
that we talk about is not the beginning is absolutely viable, but we have no way of knowing

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:16.800
whether it's true or not right now. Now, can I, so you don't agree with those? I read some reports

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:27.200
on it that if we analyze these early stages, Big Bang, blah, blah, we can find in it

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:34.400
immanently traces of something that must have happened before. You don't think this is necessary?

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:40.000
I don't think so. I know that people have pursued that possibility and Penrose is one of them,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.840
and I'm very, very glad they are pursuing the possibility, but I think that the data so far

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:52.960
as well as the theoretical predictions are that anything interesting gets wiped out in the interim

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:57.680
in that period since the Big Bang, everything was just smooth and featureless. I would love

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.880
to be wrong about that, and I hope I am, but I wouldn't buy any existing claims along those lines.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:11.760
But another thing that bothers me, not bothers me, it is that I hope we are here on the same

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:17.680
materialist side. You must have known, everybody quotes it, a dialogue, I even don't know, did it

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:25.360
really happen or not? Stephen Hawking was at some conference with the Pope and the Polish reactionary

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:34.880
guy told him, here we have no misunderstanding, Mr. Scientist, your topic is Big Bang and after

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:44.960
our topic is before, you know, I don't buy the story. I think this, sir, within the space of

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:52.240
science for an opening where somehow religion or another dimension enters, I hope we agree,

01:06:52.240 --> 01:07:00.000
this is absolutely wrong perspective, this desperate attempts, you know, to, to, to,

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:05.200
completely wrong. I mean, I don't think that religion is very informative for anything interesting. I

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:10.880
think that it's, it's plays a hugely important historic and cultural role that I respect very

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.600
much. But when I want to think about why the universe exists or where it came from, I'm going

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:20.160
to think about science and philosophy. I'm not going to think about religion. In fact, I think

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:25.840
that your Hawking story is true. And it's a reflection, there was a previous story, you know,

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:31.440
lot of the development in early days in the thirties and forties of the Big Bang model

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:38.800
was by George Lemetra, who was a Belgian priest. And the Pope put him on some commission to, you

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:45.520
know, science and religion. And the Pope at the time, who I think was pious, said, well, this

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:50.320
Big Bang theory is great. It proves that Genesis was right. It proves that the universe had a

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:57.040
beginning. And Lemetra said, no, no, no, no, do not, do not say that. Because if you started

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:01.440
saying, well, we've proven religion right by science, tomorrow, science is going to change

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.800
its mind. And you don't want to say, oh, well, we were wrong about religion.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:11.200
You know, this may interest you. I always admire, but I despise them. Don't be afraid.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:16.560
Some fundamentalists, I had along these lines, a very interesting debate,

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:24.720
some time ago with the Catholic friend, who was at least honest. You remember that mystery of

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:31.600
the Turin Shroud, you know, are those are those stains there, Christ blood. And you know what

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:41.600
confidentially this highly placed bishop told me, she prays to God every evening that this is not

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:48.720
really Christ's blood. You know what, how he reasoned. If this is somehow we prove it, what

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:55.760
don't ask me how Christ's blood, then the first question is, let's analyze DNA. And what we will

01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:03.600
get there, probably now an extremely brutal, that Christ was the result of, of Virgin Mary

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:10.880
screwing with some servant there. But it's better not to know. But some American fundamentalists

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:19.680
had a crazy answer. God doesn't have a DNA. So we will just get the double DNA of Virgin Mary

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:28.800
herself. You know, so this is for me the most dangerous temptation. This naive fundamentalist,

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:36.560
which even lack this, what I find in authentic religion is this radical openness. For example,

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:43.680
great guys, the one who was loved by by Nils Bohr Kirkegaard, he said, I'm not sure that I believe,

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:49.600
I only maybe believe that I believe. And I think the moment you go into fundamentalism,

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:56.080
you are lost. You are lost in the sense that you put, but so the final point,

01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:08.480
you know why I like so much this quantum physics against this Einsteinian view,

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:17.440
because it's usually, and I think they're idiots. I hope we agree here generally, usually people claim

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:24.000
Einstein was more a materialist, objective reality and so on while Bohr

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:33.360
opened up the path for all this stuff. But I believe that it's almost the opposite, that

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.360
Einstein is interesting. You know, his famous

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:48.880
retort to Nils Bohr. God doesn't play dice. And then he even says that I don't believe in personal

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:57.920
God, but there is a divine dimension in this eternal cosmic order, the beauty of loss of

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:05.520
nature and so on and so on. And we all know Bohr, here I bow my head to him, gave a perfect answer.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:17.280
Don't tell God what to do. What I like here is that I think that if not in the sense of any fully

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:28.320
religious sense, but in a sense of a belief in a firm order of our reality, this is for me

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:37.360
the most basic, even today I would call it not theological dimension, but this belief in what

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:44.000
in my Lacanians were gone, I call the big other. Even if we don't know it, there is a cosmic order

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:55.280
and so on. But you know that here, I think that one tool mechanics opens up a path to a much more

01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:01.360
radical materialism. And I put it, maybe you know the story in this way. And I was so glad

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:08.960
narcissistically. Two, three months ago, I watched on Austrian TV and interviewed the Austrian guy,

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:20.880
Salinger, the one of the three. And the interviewer lady asked him, literally mentioning my name,

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:28.800
that what about my idea that quantum, this old joke that I like to repeat, you probably know it,

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:37.200
that quantum physics demonstrates that God is an imperfect lazy idiot, that God was too lazy to

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:45.520
determine things to the end. And we, as it were, went too far. And he said that there is a lot,

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:52.720
at least in Europe, a lot standing joke about this, that quantum physics is one big proof that

01:12:52.720 --> 01:13:01.360
God is lazy. He didn't want to do all the work, you know, and that now, so I think this is my big

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:08.880
effort. We have, we are on the same line here, I think, how to read quantum mechanics in a strict

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:16.320
materialist way, how to get rid of all this, you know, quantum mechanics means, you know,

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:23.200
the whole syllogism is horrible. Quantum mechanics means only observer brings possibilities to

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:29.920
reality, A, the universe really exists, B, so there must be a mega observer who is,

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:38.480
who is God. But still, let's maybe slowly and at the same time, conclude with some, so I will

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:45.440
have to think a lot more, because I'm still Boda, and I will quote you simply by your final

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:54.160
formula, which is this wonderful one of many world's interpretation, we can describe the world

01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:03.440
perfectly, we just don't know where we are in it. My goal, I obviously don't know enough of size, is

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:11.920
to somehow in a totally, not in an idealist way, this means a reality just to have an observer,

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:21.040
but in a truly materialist way to somehow find a crack inconsistency in reality, which is not

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:27.440
subject, but which opens up the space for subtlety, in what sense, let me conclude before I confuse

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:35.680
you, because we here come at the point of freedom, I read Penrose, who likes to, he's one of those

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:44.320
who think that you can ground human freedom in quantum phenomena, but I think that even if you

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:53.760
accept a radical uncertainty, openness, this is not freedom, freedom is not as intelligent people

01:14:53.760 --> 01:15:00.880
want to call it, and freedom is not contingency, freedom is a different sort of determinism,

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:08.240
I do that because I decided so and so on, so this quick link, and it's very popular among

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:14.640
chief philosophers today, oh but doesn't already quantum physics open up the space for freedom,

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:21.520
it's, do you agree it's wrong, it's totally, I completely agree that that is wrong, but I will

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:26.240
mention something that I've been thinking about only recently, in fact maybe in the last hour you've

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:33.440
helped me clarify it, but there is a role for quantum mechanics, literally quantum mechanics,

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:39.200
not just metaphorically, in accounting for the richness of the world that we see around us in

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:45.200
the following sense, what if classical mechanics were true, right, what if there was no wave

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:51.280
function, everything was perfectly deterministic, you could be Laplace's demon, so you could know

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:55.280
the complete state of the world today, and that would predict the state of the world in the future

01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:01.520
in the past, if that's true, then all the richness around us, including you and me,

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:07.760
Robinson having this discussion, was inherent in the initial condition of the universe, right,

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:14.880
but no, I would play your role before, it depends how you define the work inherent,

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:21.440
you can also read, yes it does, but I have a definition, stability, blah blah, not fully

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:27.840
deterministic, you know, sorry, go on. What I'm imagining is if classical mechanics

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:33.600
had been true, then you could take our universe now, you could use the laws of physics to evolve

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:39.040
it to the early time, and it would look smooth and, you know, featureless, but only because

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:45.840
there were very, very, very subtle correlations there, that you could then evolve backward,

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:51.200
back forward to the present day, like we were implicit, let's put it that way,

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:57.040
in the initial conditions of the universe, but when you have quantum mechanics, now that's not

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:05.040
true anymore, the early universe can be truly simple and featureless, and what happens is,

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:12.400
as these branches happen and decoherence happens, then individual parts of the universe can begin

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:18.320
to look complex, and you can't predict exactly where you're going to be, because like we said,

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:22.320
there's many different futures, and you're going to be in all of them, and there's different versions

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:27.760
of you that will be in all of them, but the sort of, the action of quantum mechanics is to start

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:35.040
from a simple, beautiful, pristine state, and create many, many, many very complicated, very

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:40.960
interesting world. Now I will try to strike back with a precise metaphysical question, you said

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:48.160
at the beginning in a much more complex way, but some basic, simple, whatever you call it,

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:56.960
simplicity, but wouldn't it, if we were to be able, I'm returning to your idea of this

01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:03.440
ideal observer, which would have seen the entire picture, all the possibilities, wouldn't that

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:11.520
also involve some kind of return to simplicity, I'm not saying that it is a simplistic image,

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:18.560
it's very complex, I know all the options and so on, but in a way it would have been a flat well,

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:23.360
like everything is, well I think this is good, there's a very good point, but I think it's the

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:30.560
difference between hardware and software, right, an observer like Laplace's demon who could know

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:38.800
everything and do all the calculations is a very simple concept, not that complicated, but the data,

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:44.160
the software that that person would need to actually do the calculation correspond,

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:50.320
where universe would be incredibly complicated, whereas in quantum mechanics, Stephen Hawking

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.040
and Jim Hartle wrote it down, the way function of the universe, and all of the complexity can just

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:58.720
come about universe by universe, world by world, afterward.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:06.640
No, no, I see, I see, yes, oh my god, there are so many, okay, sorry, I'm

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:15.120
slowly getting tired, but there are so many points here, now I see where I will have to

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:24.480
rethink my position, I will, can you, this precise idea that you mentioned, now you can

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:30.320
you can even use the middleman, exclude this or what, but I would love to have,

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:39.360
do you have a text where you develop that precise point, many worlds, ideal observer,

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:44.240
everything objective, we just don't know where we are, is there a text by you?

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.800
Not yet, but I'm happy to write something down, like I said, I've just been thinking about it,

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:56.800
in the last few weeks, I like this idea that this is my dream, that I write texts so that

01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:03.280
somebody will quote them, if it's directly, it's very possible if someone else has written it down

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:08.960
already, the big problem for me, yeah, you know, yeah, I mean it might be completely unoriginal,

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:12.800
that's very possible, so I will look to see if anyone else has already written it, and if not,

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.640
I will write something down, what's the trick that people use different terms, this nightmares

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:22.400
happen to me, they do, I know, yeah, you don't find it, but another guy with just different terms,

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:30.000
yeah, I know, the same thing, you know, we're all just remixing, Slavo, I know it's late for

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.400
you where you are, is it okay if I butt in with a couple of questions before we finish, yeah,

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:41.840
but don't expect, I mean, I'm here, I will direct them toward, toward Sean, and you can, you can

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:47.680
cut in as you, as you like, but now I love this idea, now I always make this joke when people

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:54.480
ask me, would you like to have a dialogue, I say, yes, I love dialogues, but the way they're written,

01:20:54.480 --> 01:21:02.160
the late Plato's dialogue, where one guy talks all the time, and the other guy just every 10 minutes

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:10.640
says, by Zeus, so it is Socrates, so I really don't know, to that, please ask him, ask Sean.

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:20.560
Okay, yeah, so I haven't read any of Lee Smolin yet, though Einstein's Unfinished Revolution is on

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:26.560
my list, but so I've read an article that Slavo wrote, I think it's upcoming in a book next year

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:31.760
on quantum theory, but in it, in theory, just one short chapter, sorry, yeah,

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:38.080
yeah, just one chapter, just one chapter, but Slavoy paraphrases Smolin's belief that quantum

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:44.000
mechanics is the most successful theory ever formulated, but the only problem with it is that

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.160
it is wrong. And I have the sense that it is at least incomplete in that it doesn't

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:55.280
go here with relativity, so there's no quantum gravity, no theory of everything that's going

01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:01.120
to find here at Smolin. Right, right, but what I'm wondering is how you glossed this idea and

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:08.080
more important, more relevant to our discussion is whether the many worlds interpretation is

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:12.240
something that's in jeopardy on the road to this theory of everything.

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:19.600
Yeah, so I, there is a temptation in certain circles to, sorry, that's that's a little too

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:24.480
prejudicial. We don't know what the final theory of everything is, right, so each one of us as

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:29.840
individual researchers will have our favorite ways of trying to make progress. And this goes back

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:34.240
to what we discussed at the very beginning about preferences for different versions of

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:41.840
quantum mechanics. Many worlds, as a theory, is as simple as it is possible for a theory to be.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:46.720
The problem with it is that connecting it to the richness of the world involves some tricky

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:52.640
metaphysical and physical steps, right, about which people can be rightfully skeptical. Whereas

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:58.000
something like hidden variables or whatever is an ugly complicated theory, but the world is

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.480
ugly and complicated, so it matches the world in a more easy way. And you can, you can have

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:06.800
different feelings about what to do. Somewhat, there's a, there's a third way, which is someone

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:12.480
like Lee who says like, I don't quite see how it is working right now. Therefore, I will throw it

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:19.520
all out and start from scratch and try to do better. And to me, we're nowhere close to that

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:25.200
point yet. We have not yet done anything like trying to understand the world in the quantum

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:31.680
language to motivate trying to improve on quantum mechanics. In particular, just to be clear about

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:37.840
relativity, there's special relativity and general relativity. Quantum mechanics and special relativity

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:43.200
are 100% compatible. That is literally quantum field theory, which is the best tested theory in

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:48.560
the universe ever. General relativity, which says that space time is dynamical, and that's what

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:55.200
gravity is. It is true. We do not have a once and for all final quantum theory of gravity.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:01.760
But again, to me, many worlds is the most promising route forward for doing that.

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:06.480
And if you'll indulge me just for, you know, one more minute here, the reason why I think we're,

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:13.920
we're stuck is because even the most highly trained physicist learns classical physics first.

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:21.760
Newton's laws, the Kepler's laws, the planets, etc. And then they're taught how to take a classical

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:27.600
theory and convert it into a quantum theory to quantize it, right? And that's what we do with

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:33.680
electromagnetism and the standard model of particle physics and all those things. There's no law, rule,

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:39.600
or even suggestion that says that the correct quantum theory of the universe has to be obtained

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:44.000
by starting with a classical theory and quantizing it. The universe doesn't do that,

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.280
it just is quantum from the start. And if you want to imagine that maybe that's why

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:54.080
it's been difficult to quantize gravity, because you shouldn't be quantizing gravity,

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:58.480
you should be thinking about quantum mechanics and finding gravity within it.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:03.360
And clear, I would argue, I'm not going to bother you with it now, but I would strongly

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:07.360
argue the right framework to do that in is exactly many worlds.

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:19.200
But okay, now it came to me, my last, not attack, but problem. You know, I mentioned this, I admit it,

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:26.720
very suspicious parallel between many worlds and you pointed out immediately the difference and this

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:33.440
in our symbolic universe superpositions, this may happen, that may happen. But what is,

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:40.640
this is my restraint, not that the theory is too crazy, my god, I'm a Hegelian, the more crazy

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:52.560
it is, the more we like it. But I have another problem. But this different, for example, 99%

01:25:52.560 --> 01:26:02.960
the discappals, 1% okay, and we have both. But though these two, or I don't know how many,

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:10.560
intimate universes, somehow interact or it's just totally different lines. This is, as a

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:17.200
philosopher, maybe it's a wrong instinct, I would be obsessed with some interaction, you know,

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:23.200
let's to say it's very primitive, what I will say, I in advance apologize once to say yes,

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:31.520
we live in this 99%, but somehow to understand it, you have to read it against the background of

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:39.840
that shitty 1%, which that's what I don't find in many worlds, or I don't know enough about it.

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:45.280
How would you react to this? The short answer is the different worlds will not interact.

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:51.440
This is something which Everett, when he first wrote down the ideas in the 1950s,

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:55.760
he was not clear on, he didn't have quite the technology that we have, the intellectual

01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:01.360
technology we have. But this is exactly what decoherence gets you. Since the 70s and 80s,

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:07.600
when we understand decoherence better, it's not just that you are allowed to think about

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:12.480
different parts of the wave function as separate worlds. But it's literally the right way to think

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:17.520
about them. They don't interact, they won't interact going forward, because they've decoherent

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:23.520
from each other. And there's a technical exposition about that involving states in the environment

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:28.000
being perpendicular to each other. There's a small footnote there, because if you wait

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:36.080
really long, if you wait 10 to the 100 years, then all of the worlds will in some sense blur back

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:44.000
together into one big world. The use of our universe is a crucial feature in allowing these

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.640
different worlds to be separate. But even though Hollywood would like it to be otherwise, in the

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:53.360
real world, the separate many world branches are completely non-interacting with each other.

01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:01.600
It was mentioned to me by our middleman that, did you or am I misreading you,

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:07.760
that you kind of read in detail the strip of that shitty movie and this very predicate makes it

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:14.240
clear why they don't like it, everything everywhere and so on. Because what I didn't like in it is

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:20.640
that with all these different versions, at the end it has this shitty conclusion, but this is the

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:26.720
real world, we should accept it and so on. I would like, what is missing for me in the movie is

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:33.920
precisely what you're going to tell this, but we don't know where we are and so on. This uncertainty

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:40.480
is lost, I think, in the movie. You know, you're completely right. I didn't read it ahead of time,

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:45.600
but I did interview the director's writers on my podcast. We had a wonderful conversation.

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:51.280
They're very smart people, but the demands of narrative are different than the demands of physics

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:58.000
is the problem. And not only multiverse movies, but time travel movies have the same

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:04.880
feature where even though there's multiple timelines or whatever, the narrative focus

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:13.040
implicitly lends more value to certain characters and devalues other characters.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.360
And if this were the real world, that would be completely illegitimate, right? Like all the

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:20.880
different people in the different timelines, they have a right to exist. You're telling me

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:26.000
you're going to eliminate my timeline just because it's not yours? You're a genocidal monster. That's

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:33.200
terrible. No, because that's my problem. Now I will go even one step lower. Did you see Indiana

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:42.720
Jones's face? I did, I did. You did? Oh, we are normal people. You know, the moment I, like,

01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:49.440
it's a shitty movie, but for some reasons I found some, first for me, it's a very desperate movie.

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:55.920
It's clear that Indiana Jones's desire is archimedes. I want to remain there. And that

01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:02.240
beat punches him, go back. And it's a very desperate ending. Her function of fervor,

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:10.240
that actress, is not erotic. It's just to bring the couple back together. And you know how they are,

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:18.320
two desperate old men embracing and so on. Can you even compare this with being in Syracuse at

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:25.440
that point and so on? This I find much more productive. The conclusion is not, but this is

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:34.960
the real world or whatever. You know, I could not possibly agree more. I am, I don't like the movie,

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:41.200
but I find now, you know what attracted me to Indiana Jones 5? That it was so universally

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:47.920
attached, a total bullshit or whatever. It's, no, it automatically evokes my sympathy, no?

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:55.040
Well, there's, there's a fundamental conservative, teleological aspect to this way of thinking that

01:30:55.040 --> 01:31:01.040
our timeline, our universe is the right one and we should be in it. And we cannot possibly think

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:06.000
about improving it by changing the past or anything like that. I think that the filmmakers missed a

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.800
chance they should have left Indy, spoiler alert, back there with Archimedes. He would have been

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:17.920
happier. He's getting old anyway. They went for a sappy lowbrow ending. No, but so at least

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:25.920
we can conclude in this way then that in spite of all from my side, unresolved dangers and so on,

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:34.240
we, you put it wonderfully now. The big lesson of also in many words, the quantum physics is

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:41.520
always bear in mind that this is not the only possible world. You know, don't, don't put this

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:48.480
universe as a major or as you put it nicely in this teleological sense, like that's what again

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:55.440
bothered me in everything everywhere. As if the reality is here in that tax office even with

01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:03.680
genie liquor display and all these tricks gotten back is thus so that you return more satisfied,

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:12.160
happy to this world. I would opt for a much more desperate solution that, that she that actors

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:18.000
would have traveled in different worlds were many much better than totally desperate. She ends up

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:25.600
here with the awareness of what would have been, you know. You know, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:33.840
see the script for that before it was made, but I did consult on the Avengers movies with Thanos

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:40.560
destroying the world and then they went back in time to fix it, etc. And I argued that if you go

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:44.800
back in time and fix it, you know, you're, they had this multiple timeline thing and I don't want

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:50.320
you to eliminate a timeline. I think that's, that's terrible. But as I said, what you should do is allow

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:58.000
the timelines to re rejoin each other so that individuals have memories of both in their

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.160
future selves, but they didn't go for that. It was too complicated. No, but that again, the problem

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:12.880
for me would be, I would like to rework many worlds interpretation, but I know I'm here

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:19.040
confusing a pure physical process with symbolic one where this would have been possible, you know,

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:28.560
this rejoining key, not in this sense, because as for this time travel travels and so on, you know,

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:35.280
which is a wonderful, totally pessimist version of it. I forgot the title, you know, the the

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:43.600
British now he's a little bit old actor Christopher Fry. She played Oscar Wilde also in the movie.

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:52.000
No, yeah. She wrote a novel which is so desperately pessimist. He even done almost

01:33:52.000 --> 01:34:01.120
realistically physically scientifically nonsense. A guy, a scientist whose family died in Auschwitz,

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:10.480
wants to prevent this. So she invents a rather primitive time travel machine. Not you can

01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:17.680
move up and down. Just you pick up a moment in time and you can do some little change there.

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:26.240
So what she does in this is this, this scientist, she there was in the village where Hitler was

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:36.240
born, a small stream above for which all the village was drinking water. So she puts around the time of

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:46.880
when Hitler had to be conceived, she puts into the water very limited intervention, just some

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:56.960
poisonous element which makes women infertile. So Hitler is not born. Then he steps out of his

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:06.240
laboratory and goes into the world and finds a nightmare. Nazism developed, but instead of Hitler,

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:13.680
somebody like Werner von Braun, a much more able scientist became the leader and developed the

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:19.520
bomb and the Nazis won. So here we have a wonderful, totally pessimistic denouement.

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:28.000
He tries to go back to bring back Hitler, so that at least the good guys will win.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:35.920
I love, speaking about alternate histories, there is a wonderful book that I love, I forgot the title,

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:43.280
a whole book on alternate histories, stories about what might have happened with Hitler.

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:48.480
There are the usual lines, he survived, went to Argentina, whatever, blah, blah, blah. Then

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:56.800
different battles, how he might have won, but my favorite one is in his youth. Isn't this wonderful

01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:05.440
alternate history? Hitler succeeds as a painter and whoops into painting his horrible visuals,

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:14.400
becomes a great modernist, becomes a celebrated artist and end of Nazism, so on, you know. Although

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:22.480
this is, I know, I don't take it seriously, but it's very refreshing to think along these terms,

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:28.240
that's all I'm saying. It was so delicious, sorry I'm getting tired, but I really will,

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:35.200
so you will write, you don't yet have that text. I don't, but I'll think about it, definitely.

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:43.280
Please, because, okay, then, can I, in quoting Q, refer to this event here? Because I really want to

01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:49.840
immediately, quickly, in the chapter that you, the middleman know, I will add a footnote and,

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:57.120
as not a footnote, a couple of pages, but in a sincere way. You know how we intellectuals,

01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:02.320
you are more honest, I hope so, physicist, human, you know how you cheat? I will

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:11.040
to write a page and then I put a footnote. When I already wrote these pages, I noticed that a

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:18.400
friend of mine will cheat a similar idea and so on, you know, Eurella, I will not do this, I will do it.

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:26.240
100% yes. I'm really grateful for this, because, you know, no, we didn't just blah, blah, and we

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:32.960
didn't just fraternally agree, we located the difference, but at the same time, we draw so many

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:41.440
precise lines, you know, because would you agree to finish in a more upbeat sense that, my God,

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:49.760
we live in a wonderful time where the big, the big even metaphysical questions are again

01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:56.640
arising, you know, in the sense of, yeah, even one big fan sees it now, you cannot just

01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:04.160
ignore it, no? Right, and I do want to, I just want to insert that if you, if you go back to the past

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:09.520
and change things, they like, as you imply, they might get better or worse, there's no rule that

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:17.440
we live in the best, or the worst, because I even read a pessimist novel about Stalinism,

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:24.880
where Stalin is killed, but he's killed in 35, and the one who takes over is Yezhov,

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:29.760
his secret policeman, and it's even worse, you can imagine, you know, if you were, yes.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:36.480
Yeah, that's, I think my pessimist lesson also from my, although in Yugoslavia, communism was pretty

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:44.560
soft, you know, but you know, here also, I think a quantum approach in a general sense

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:51.440
gives you to think, for example, I will make not just a political point, but the modest ones,

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:58.240
I was recently at the round table, sorry, in London, and there were some black ladies from South

01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:06.080
Africa, and I asked them frankly, I wanted to be honest, not Eurocentric, I said, listen, I read

01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:12.240
a lot how in South Africa, electricity, cops, the state is falling apart, blah, blah, blah,

01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:19.120
and I almost cried, one of the black ladies was so honest, he said I'm engaged for decades in A

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:28.560
and C struggle, but he told me he told us that the situation is now so sad that among the poor blacks,

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:38.720
blacks, poor in South Africa, you notice the predominant nostalgia forever, because he said,

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:44.560
listen, the standard of living was even a little bit better than now. They had enough thought, blah,

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:50.480
blah, now it's no electricity chaos, while there was, it was a police state which wins

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:56.720
less violence, some kind of basic order, and now, you know, the black are, you know, that now,

01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:04.800
under, after three decades of how of A and C rule, you know that South Africa is a country with

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:13.280
the greatest tension between rich and poor in the world, in the entire world, and then, of course,

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:19.680
something totally predictable happened, another black lady attacked me, although I didn't say

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:25.200
anything, as a racist, you don't have the right to talk about this, you know, she played the game of

01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:32.800
you, white people are responsible even now for all the mistakes, to be cynical, he played this in

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:40.080
bad sense, super determination, you white people are responsible for all the mistakes now, you know,

01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:49.280
and here I think this kind of alternate thinking is necessary, like where did think really go wrong,

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:57.840
and I think it's too naive, because the radical leftist answer is too naive, it's because Mandela

01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:03.360
didn't go to the end, if he were to make no compromise with, but then it would have been,

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:11.520
then it would have been Mugabe Zimbabwe, you know, only earlier there, you know, and this is a terrifying

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:17.840
problem for me, but we are losing time, listen, it was such a pleasure for me, I hope that we

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:26.400
meet again, and are you allowed the middleman to give me Sean's email, and no, but I have it,

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:34.400
because you CC connect, yeah, I have it, if I will, can I don't, don't be afraid, I'm not this

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:41.040
kind of a stalker who now in two hours will ask you 10 questions, and say this, but if I have a

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:47.040
short precise question, can I ask you and you give me one sentence answer, you know,

01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:51.760
because you are my only, the last thing I'm always tempted,

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:58.880
it's sensational, but is it true what many quantum physicists, okay, sound, which means that

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:06.080
Stephen Hawking did his real work while he was young, lately he was more just popularizing

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:11.920
thing, is this true or it's not so simple? I mean, that's, there is some truth in that,

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:16.080
but there's also truth in exactly the same statement applied to a lot of people who did

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:24.080
not have a degenerative neuron disease, so he was obsessed with these hidden variables for decades,

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:30.480
but it's, he'll meet 20s that he did his great work, no? This is a young person's game, one,

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:37.280
no matter what your level of physical ability is. That's why I shade, it's even historically wrong,

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:45.280
this tendency to look at the old age, the last text of words by a big name, as if there is some

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:51.760
final truth in them, it's totally wrong, like to amuse you with the last story,

01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:59.360
Jacques Lacan, when he was dying, had a young mistress, Catherine Mio, and she almost made the

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:06.160
career out of being there at his side when she was dying, and he mumbled some things,

01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:13.840
what did she mean with those, well, what if it was nothing, it was just a confused trembling,

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:21.520
and I see this even with many philosophers, a lot of them reach their greatest point in their

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:32.720
middle ages, and then they just slowly go down, I mean, no? Well, I hope sincerely that in the battle

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:42.080
of quantum physicists, you will emerge as a winner, and then it's your KGB terror to

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:48.640
do, you know, when I give a talk, and you know, usually before they ask you there,

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:53.600
could you just say somewhere to test the microphone, you know what I always say,

01:43:54.800 --> 01:44:03.280
Robespierre, no freedom for the enemies of freedom, this should be our motto, we thanks

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:11.040
very much, thanks very much, if you, the middleman, if there is something too stupid or whatever,

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:17.040
I give you, now I will be the victim, I give you all the Stalinist right to cut it short,

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:23.280
though we did whatever you want, I'm not a narcissist here, I'm really a communist at this

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:28.960
level, you know that whenever there is a conflict between an individual and an institution, I prefer

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:35.520
to be automatically on the side of the institute, because I edit some book series, and don't you

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:43.680
hate authors, you see, you talk one comma there, destroys everything and so on, you know, so I'm

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:51.680
really grateful for this, it helped me a lot, the only, my only reproach to you, Sean, is that

01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:58.320
you ruined my evening, because I wanted this so dirty old movie, now I will have to go into it

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:06.160
and quickly write two, three pages, no? My apologies for that, that's what I do. No, here, I, you're

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:12.400
pardoned for everything, but not for this, when the people take power for this, okay, I'm a good guy,

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:19.920
you don't get gulag, but you will get two years of reeducation camp, you know, like, get up and

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:25.040
fight. I could use that anyway, that's okay, education is always good. Thanks very much, and

01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:32.480
again, the middleman, really, I mean it, don't even ask me, do all the dirty stuff,

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:39.920
you know, all my confusions and one, sorry? The middleman is probably, is not going to be

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:45.120
cutting anything out, because this has been the middleman's most successful conversation yet,

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:51.280
since I haven't had to speak at all. But I like the middleman, the term, you know why, because

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:57.440
he wrote this show today, people don't like authority. I always like authority in the sense

01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:04.400
that sometimes you need authority in the debate when it goes, but today, already at the level of

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:10.880
words, it gets confused, no longer likes to talk about director, leader, the favorite

01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:18.480
term is ordinator, you know, it sounds, you keep all your power, but it sounds much more innocent,

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:24.240
you know, and just coordinating things, you know. So I know, and you know, that's why I still have

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:30.400
hope in Iran, I have connections there on the opposite side, and they told me, you know,

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:35.760
still you cannot contend Iran in spite of all that's going there now with something like Saudi Arabia.

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:41.920
Women were able to, women were able to protest precisely because they have a strong role, for

01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:48.240
example, it's a common joke there that the big guy is a minister, usually a man.

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:55.840
Although, or even this is not the case, you have one, two feminine ministers in government, but

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:04.320
immediately when you make there to make a business deal, you discover that the minister is an idiot,

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:09.200
and you have to talk with persons around him who are in majority women.

01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:18.880
What underestimated Iran, it's tremendous, they are so crazy, they translated 15 of my books,

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:24.960
they are, it's intellectual, no, this is not a good sign for them, it's a sign of contusion,

01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:32.720
if I want to say is that it's intellectually alive, while in other countries, Egypt and so on,

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:40.880
it's very tragic how little they translate, they simply don't have this humanity, social sciences

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:45.440
life that we share, you know. The history does matter, the histories there are very different.

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:52.800
Yeah, yeah, but as Iranians point out, they are not simply a Muslim country, they are Farsi,

01:47:52.800 --> 01:48:00.480
Persian, no, and they always proudly point out, we are not Arabs, you know, sorry for this

01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:07.440
because today you never know what will be proclaimed as racism, you know.

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:14.160
Yes, thank you both, this has been a blast. Hold on Geeselings, before you go, please like,
