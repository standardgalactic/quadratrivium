Hello, this is Robinson Earhart, here with the introduction to Robinson's podcast, number

00:06.080 --> 00:14.800
196. And this episode is with the brilliant Stephen Wolfram, who is the founder and CEO

00:14.800 --> 00:24.080
of Wolfram Research, the creator of Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, and the Wolfram Language. And

00:24.080 --> 00:29.360
among his many other accomplishments, Stephen received his PhD in theoretical physics from

00:29.360 --> 00:35.360
Caltech when he was only 20 years old with the renowned physicist Richard Feynman on his committee.

00:35.920 --> 00:43.360
This is Stephen's second appearance on the show, much to my delight. And in episode 102,

00:43.360 --> 00:52.000
we talked about artificial intelligence, chat GPT, and then there was a lengthy and enjoyable

00:52.000 --> 00:57.680
digression into the philosophy of math. In this one, though, we turn to another of Stephen's

00:57.760 --> 01:04.800
ambitious projects, which is his search for the fundamental theory of physics, and how it has

01:04.800 --> 01:14.400
led him to a very mysterious structure called the rouliad, which is the entangled limit of all

01:14.400 --> 01:20.880
possible computations. That's a mouthful, but we'll get into that in a lot more detail. And

01:20.880 --> 01:27.280
Stephen believes that the rouliad, though I don't want to put words into his mouth, so these are

01:27.280 --> 01:34.960
my words, is the universe or that the universe is part of the rouliad. And observers like us are

01:34.960 --> 01:42.960
simply embedded in the rouliad and experiencing it in different ways. We also, along the way,

01:43.520 --> 01:50.640
get into some ideas in the philosophy of science, some metaphysics about abstract and concrete

01:50.640 --> 01:57.120
objects, and then the foundations of quantum mechanics. A lot of the material that we discussed

01:57.120 --> 02:03.840
can be found in Stephen's book, A Project to Find the Fundamental Theory of Physics, and in

02:03.840 --> 02:10.160
writings on his website, including an article titled The Concept of the Rouliad, links to which

02:10.160 --> 02:18.720
are in the description. He also does plenty of live streams, he posts plenty of other articles,

02:19.520 --> 02:24.080
there are Q&As, so there's also a link to his website where you can find all of these things.

02:24.640 --> 02:31.520
On my end, reviews, likes, comments, subscribes, these are all very much appreciated, and there is

02:31.520 --> 02:39.280
also now a Patreon, a link to which is in the description. If you are interested in supporting

02:39.280 --> 02:47.040
the show, add free episodes, there's an RSS feed to that, and then some very nice show notes and

02:47.040 --> 02:54.000
takeaways. But now, without any further ado, I hope that you enjoy this conversation as much as I

02:54.000 --> 03:10.880
enjoyed having it with Steve. Before we get to the rouliad, I want to start a bit with its history,

03:11.120 --> 03:18.000
which I guess is also your history, and my understanding from talking with string theorists,

03:18.000 --> 03:25.440
causal set theorists, loop, quantum, gravity theorists is that many other theories of everything

03:25.440 --> 03:31.680
have come out of quantum gravity since general relativity and quantum field theory are two

03:31.680 --> 03:37.760
best physical theories, but my understanding is that the rouliad did not come from this direction

03:37.760 --> 03:43.280
at all. So where did your search for the fundamental theory of physics begin?

03:44.720 --> 03:50.240
Well, it's complicated stories. So when I was a teenager, I was interested in physics, and

03:51.920 --> 03:57.920
I became a pro before too very long, and I worked on quantum field theory and general

03:57.920 --> 04:04.960
relativity, basically, particle physics and cosmology and so on. And that was in the late 1970s,

04:05.760 --> 04:13.040
and at that time, I wasn't in the, let's find a theory of everything, I was in,

04:13.040 --> 04:16.720
we have some theories, they're starting to actually work, things like QCD,

04:16.720 --> 04:21.120
things about the early universe and cosmology and so on. Let's figure out the consequences of

04:21.120 --> 04:27.200
these theories. And that was a fertile thing at that time. And it was, I managed to make some

04:27.200 --> 04:34.320
progress on that. Then I got, I was making computational tools that I used, I don't know

04:34.320 --> 04:39.680
why other people didn't use them, but at least at the time, there were these computational

04:39.680 --> 04:45.680
tools for doing calculations in mathematical physics and so on. I used these to great effect.

04:46.320 --> 04:54.000
Then in 1979, I kind of realized I had outgrown all existing computational tools, and well,

04:54.000 --> 04:59.040
next step was build my own. So I started doing that. And that led to this thing called SMP,

04:59.040 --> 05:05.200
which was kind of a forerunner of Mathematica and both in language. And in building SMP,

05:05.200 --> 05:12.080
I kind of was a, this is, I want to make this computational system, what are, think about it

05:12.080 --> 05:16.240
like a natural scientist, what are the kind of primitives of computation from which we can build

05:16.240 --> 05:24.000
this. And so I did that, built the system, practical system, etc, etc, etc. And then I got

05:24.000 --> 05:31.600
back into doing basic science. This is probably 1981 or so. And I had this, you know, this basic

05:31.600 --> 05:38.080
question about sort of where does complexity come from in the universe. And that the sort of the

05:38.080 --> 05:43.520
standard mathematical physics that I knew didn't tell me much about that. Well, I realized, and

05:43.520 --> 05:47.600
this is sort of back projecting history, because at the time I wouldn't have explained it this way.

05:47.600 --> 05:53.440
But the thing I realize now is that the experience of building this computational language SMP

05:53.440 --> 06:00.400
back then, from sort of these abstract computational primitives kind of gave me the meta idea that you

06:00.400 --> 06:06.480
could just sort of construct a theory from nothing, so to speak, that you could construct a theory,

06:06.480 --> 06:10.560
sort of from the ground up, rather than doing what one traditionally does in natural science,

06:10.560 --> 06:16.320
which is to say, look at the universe as it is, and try and say, how does one get to,

06:16.320 --> 06:21.120
how does one reverse engineer the universe as it is. So that kind of experience of building

06:21.120 --> 06:27.600
this computational system from sort of abstract primitives was the thing that kind of got me into

06:27.600 --> 06:33.280
this idea of let's, let's see what happens when we just start from some abstract primitives and

06:33.280 --> 06:37.440
build things from there. What, what do we get? Do we get something that's like the natural world?

06:37.440 --> 06:41.360
Do we get something completely different? And then the big kind of set of discoveries that I made

06:41.360 --> 06:47.920
about these things called cellular automata that are just, you know, simple rules applied to grid

06:48.720 --> 06:54.320
lines of black and white squares and so on, that the big surprise was, if you just do the computer

06:54.320 --> 06:59.840
experiments, you just sort of turn your computational telescope out into the computational universe,

06:59.840 --> 07:04.640
you discover some remarkable phenomena, particularly you discover that even when the rules are very

07:04.640 --> 07:13.520
simple, the behavior is complicated. And so that to me at first, that was a story of kind of the

07:14.160 --> 07:19.280
explaining things in the natural world. How does one explain sort of the complexity of snowflakes

07:19.280 --> 07:25.680
or turbulence and fluid flow? What are the underlying sort of foundational ideas, the kind of

07:27.200 --> 07:34.000
sort of pre physics sort of abstract ideas that lead to this? It's not traditional mathematics,

07:34.000 --> 07:39.360
it's not traditional mathematical physics. It's something different. It, I realized,

07:39.360 --> 07:44.400
was this kind of computational foundation. So I worked on that for a number of years,

07:44.400 --> 07:52.640
then I kind of had a sort of an attempt to build what ends up getting called complexity theory

07:52.640 --> 08:01.040
as a sort of, as an actual activity in the world. And the process of doing that convinced me, okay,

08:01.040 --> 08:05.920
plan B is just figure out a bunch of stuff myself. Let's not wait for the rest of the world to do

08:05.920 --> 08:09.760
this. Let's just figure it out myself. And that led me to start building mathematical

08:09.760 --> 08:16.080
law from language and our company. And also in the end, this book, big book, a new kind of science

08:16.080 --> 08:24.160
that I would now describe as being at its heart, it's a work of Ruleology. It's a given these rules,

08:24.160 --> 08:30.480
what happens in the world. And the big surprise there was that sort of given these rules, the

08:30.480 --> 08:35.040
given very simple rules, there was just a lot of richness in what happened and a lot of general

08:35.040 --> 08:39.280
principles like the idea of computational irreducibility, the principle of computational

08:39.280 --> 08:45.040
equivalence and so on, these kind of emergent general principles that I kind of realized were

08:45.040 --> 08:52.000
there from having done this kind of essentially in a natural history study of Ruleology of kind

08:52.000 --> 08:57.920
of what do rules out there in the computational universe do. Anyway, they're one of the use cases

08:57.920 --> 09:03.360
for this kind of new kind of science based on sort of thinking about things computationally.

09:03.360 --> 09:08.640
One of the use cases like couldn't avoid looking at was fundamental physics, because after all I

09:08.640 --> 09:14.080
knew a bunch about fundamental physics. And the obvious question was, you can see that

09:14.080 --> 09:18.960
from such a simple rule, you can get all this complicated behavior. So now the question is,

09:18.960 --> 09:24.800
well, what about the universe? That's our sort of biggest example of sort of complicated behavior.

09:24.800 --> 09:30.480
Could it to be the result of some very simple rule? Well, the first thing I knew was that

09:30.480 --> 09:36.000
cellular automata weren't going to do it. That was what we know from relativity about the structure

09:36.000 --> 09:42.480
of space and time and so on. Cellular automata say, let's start off assuming we know that sort of

09:42.480 --> 09:47.600
things are laid out in space in a particular way, that they sort of update in time in a particular

09:47.600 --> 09:53.200
way. We've already locked in the structure of space and time as this kind of grid. And that's not how

09:53.200 --> 09:58.880
the universe actually works. Actually, I recently learned that back in the early part of the 20th

09:58.880 --> 10:03.200
century, well, I knew that many physicists believed that, for example, spaces that was

10:03.200 --> 10:08.480
discrete at that time. But I think Heisenberg in particular had a model of kind of discrete cells

10:08.480 --> 10:13.760
in space that's very much like a cellular automata model. And he didn't actually make it work. And

10:13.760 --> 10:17.520
the fact that he didn't had some interesting historical consequences. I didn't I didn't

10:17.520 --> 10:22.480
really know that had been done by him at that time. But anyway, that wasn't going to work. So

10:23.120 --> 10:29.040
early 1990s, I'm sort of thinking about this kind of thing. And the big idea at that time was the

10:29.040 --> 10:35.680
realization that a network is a much more flexible structure from which you can potentially build

10:35.680 --> 10:42.720
space than this sort of fixed grid. So that sort of a technical thing, it's like you imagine

10:42.720 --> 10:49.440
that space is made of just discrete points. And the only thing those points sort of have to say

10:49.440 --> 10:53.520
for themselves is how they're related to other points. So you're building up this kind of network

10:53.520 --> 10:59.920
of relations. And then the result that I knew by the mid 1990s was much like when you look at a

10:59.920 --> 11:04.800
fluid with a bunch of molecules bouncing around, what emerges from that molecular dynamics on a

11:04.800 --> 11:11.040
large scale is fluid dynamics is kind of the large features of fluids. I knew that what emerged

11:11.040 --> 11:15.840
from sort of the small scale of these this network and updates on the network and so on,

11:15.840 --> 11:20.080
what would emerge on the large on a large scale with all sorts of sort of footnotes

11:20.080 --> 11:26.480
was general stability, the structure of space and time as we are familiar with it from 20th

11:26.480 --> 11:31.840
century physics. So it was kind of exciting. I didn't figure out quantum mechanics at that time.

11:31.840 --> 11:41.680
I had ideas about it. I was frankly prejudiced from my own sort of desire, I suppose, to believe

11:41.760 --> 11:47.840
that sort of the the the progress of history is somehow unique. And that there wasn't, you know,

11:47.840 --> 11:52.400
that there weren't lots of copies of us all over the place doing different kinds of things.

11:52.400 --> 11:59.120
And I didn't, you know, I didn't really see how that worked. So then I well, I kind of it was sort

11:59.120 --> 12:05.040
of my my friends in physics at that time were like, like, you know, we hate the fact that you're

12:05.040 --> 12:09.680
going off to this completely different idea about how fundamental physics might work from the

12:09.680 --> 12:14.240
mathematical physics that we've all been doing for the last, you know, 50 or 100 years. And

12:14.800 --> 12:18.560
so I was like, okay, fine, you know, the market doesn't want this, I'm going to go off and do

12:18.560 --> 12:23.360
other things. So I worked on both Malphyr and computational language and all sorts of things

12:23.360 --> 12:31.760
like that. 20, what was it, 2018, I guess, I kept on coming back to thinking about this kind of,

12:31.760 --> 12:37.840
you know, what could one make progress with in fundamental physics. And the the thing that

12:38.800 --> 12:43.920
that then happened was I sort of realized that there was some with some things I didn't like,

12:43.920 --> 12:47.440
there were kind of arbitrary and the way that I done these set up these networks and things,

12:47.440 --> 12:52.640
I made some progress, thinking about hypergraphs instead of ordinary graphs and so on, that helped

12:52.640 --> 12:58.240
sort of unlock various technical aspects of things. Then 2019, a couple of young physicists who knew

12:58.240 --> 13:03.040
about what I've been doing were like, you know, you can't just leave this project undone, you know,

13:03.120 --> 13:07.200
you got to go forward and actually actually do something with this. And so that led to

13:07.840 --> 13:13.200
something that went vastly more quickly than I expected in 2019 of building up our physics

13:13.200 --> 13:19.520
project and actually understanding about how quantum mechanics works and turned out the thing

13:19.520 --> 13:25.280
that I was afraid of doesn't actually happen for reasons that I could not did not previously foresee.

13:25.920 --> 13:33.200
But the, okay, so so how does that work? This is a long tangled tail. I mean, the sort of big,

13:34.320 --> 13:41.280
you know, the next big sort of injection of of kind of confidence building was the fact that

13:41.920 --> 13:48.480
we seem to be able to reproduce the main features of 20th century physics from this underlying

13:49.120 --> 13:56.960
completely abstract infrastructure. And but then there was still a problem, because the problem was,

13:56.960 --> 14:01.520
I thought at first, we're searching for the fundamental rule, the fundamental computational

14:01.520 --> 14:09.040
rule from which our universe comes. But that always bothered me, because it's like, we get to that,

14:09.040 --> 14:15.040
it's kind of the end of Copernicanism in some sense, you know, we were, we keep on being told,

14:15.120 --> 14:19.680
we're not special, you know, our planet isn't the center of the universe, etc, etc, etc.

14:19.680 --> 14:24.080
So then if we find this rule, and it's one particular rule, we can hold it in our hands,

14:24.080 --> 14:29.680
and maybe it's a simple rule that seems to us simple, why did we get the simple rule universe

14:29.680 --> 14:34.160
and not some completely different universe. So that really bothered me for a long time. And as

14:34.160 --> 14:39.200
is usually the case with these kinds of things, that, you know, it's like, I don't know how I'll

14:39.200 --> 14:45.280
explain that, it's kind of like, in, you know, when Newton was doing sort of celestial mechanics,

14:45.280 --> 14:49.920
we're saying, well, once the planets are set in motion, I can work out what happened. But,

14:49.920 --> 14:54.080
you know, how did they get into their initial configuration? You know, that's the work of God,

14:54.080 --> 14:59.680
so to speak, was what he said at that time. Same with Darwin trying to figure out, you know,

15:00.720 --> 15:07.040
sort of the natural selection, but how did the first life come about? In both of these cases,

15:07.120 --> 15:13.440
what we know from sort of the long run of history is that sort of the, it was a thing from outside

15:13.440 --> 15:19.520
the systems that they were thinking about, that led them to eventually led people after them to be

15:19.520 --> 15:24.960
able to understand, you know, how could a solar system form, etc. etc. etc. So in this case,

15:25.520 --> 15:35.040
the thing that we realized was that this idea that you're searching for the rule, and then you

15:35.040 --> 15:41.440
have to say, well, why this rule and not another, it's just not the right question. The, what's,

15:41.440 --> 15:48.160
what's really going on, I think, is that all possible rules are being run. Now, we had a big

15:48.160 --> 15:53.680
tip off to this, because in this network, and the network is continually getting rewritten,

15:53.680 --> 15:58.160
and you're getting a new network at every moment in time, there are many different ways that that

15:58.160 --> 16:05.040
rewriting can happen. And that leads to many different parts of history, where you've got this

16:05.040 --> 16:09.040
network, it can be rewritten one way, it can be rewritten another way, those are two different

16:09.040 --> 16:14.800
branches. After a while, the, the ways that it can get rewritten may end up with the exact same

16:14.800 --> 16:19.840
network, two different branches may end up producing the same network. So then you have a merge in

16:19.840 --> 16:24.720
this, in this thing, we call a multirate graph, which is this kind of graph of the histories,

16:24.720 --> 16:31.280
possible histories of the universe, not possible, the graph of histories of the universe. And, and so

16:31.280 --> 16:36.720
the kind of the, the first big tip off is that we're not looking for the history of the universe,

16:36.720 --> 16:44.480
we're looking for this graph of these different histories of the universe. And, and in some sense,

16:44.480 --> 16:51.200
the sort of the, I suppose, ontological sort of view of this is they're all happening. It's not

16:51.280 --> 16:56.640
that we picked a particular one, it's they're all happening. And then the realization is that as

16:56.640 --> 17:04.160
observers of the universe, we, our, our minds are also doing this kind of branching and merging

17:04.160 --> 17:08.720
that the rest of the universe is doing. So this kind of how do we perceive the universe, it's the

17:08.720 --> 17:14.720
story of how does a branching and merging mind perceive a branching and merging universe. And

17:14.720 --> 17:20.960
that story ends up essentially being the story of quantum mechanics. And it's so, so kind of

17:20.960 --> 17:26.000
this idea that we are an extended thing with respect to what we call branchial space, the

17:26.000 --> 17:32.960
space of possible branches of history. So, so that was, that was kind of the, the realization there.

17:32.960 --> 17:38.560
Then we realized, well, but you can take this even further, rather than taking a particular rule and

17:38.560 --> 17:44.880
applying it in all possible ways. Let's just consider all possible rules. Now the question is,

17:44.880 --> 17:50.480
so how do we perceive the thing you get from studying sort of the evolution of all possible

17:50.480 --> 17:55.920
rules? You might say, how can you say anything definite from a thing where all possible rules

17:55.920 --> 18:03.360
are happening? Well, it is in fact, a very rigid structure. You might think it's a big floppy thing,

18:03.360 --> 18:08.000
because everything can sort of in some sense, everything can happen. But there is a dynamics

18:08.000 --> 18:14.160
to it. It's not as if everything can sort of happen all at once. It's that there is, you know,

18:14.160 --> 18:19.040
this thing happens, then that thing happens, there is a chain of causality about what happens.

18:19.680 --> 18:26.400
And yes, it's sort of all possible chains to be followed. But there's, there's still a sort of a

18:26.400 --> 18:33.920
very rigid structure to this whole system. And so then the, that thing, that sort of entangled

18:34.560 --> 18:43.520
limit of all possible computations is what we call the Ruliad. And so now the point is that what one

18:43.520 --> 18:51.280
has to think about is, if that's what there is, in some sense, what do we perceive about what there

18:51.280 --> 18:57.840
is? Because we are part of the Ruliad. So the question of what we perceive about the universe

18:57.840 --> 19:02.800
is a question of how do we, there's a certain kind of observer of the Ruliad. We're not observing

19:02.800 --> 19:09.120
the whole Ruliad. We are observing some tiny little piece of the Ruliad. It's very much like in

19:09.120 --> 19:14.320
physical space, we're sitting on this particular planet, you know, in this particular corner of

19:14.320 --> 19:20.000
some particular galaxy. And so our perception of the universe is based on that particularity of

19:20.000 --> 19:25.120
where we are. And there isn't really a theory of where we are, we are where we are, we can go and

19:25.120 --> 19:30.720
trace back and say, well, you know, our galaxy evolved in this or that way. But, you know, once

19:30.720 --> 19:36.560
we know where we are, so to speak, then we have a certain perception of the universe. And the point

19:36.560 --> 19:44.240
is, the realization is, it's the same story with the Ruliad. That is, we are, we as observers are

19:44.240 --> 19:53.280
sort of, we are taking a particular tiny slice of the Ruliad. Now, the big question is, so can we say

19:53.280 --> 20:00.160
anything sort of scientifically based on this? And the thing that I realized is that, that the key

20:00.240 --> 20:06.720
observation is that for, it depends on what kind of an observer you are. If you were an observer

20:06.720 --> 20:12.000
outside the Ruliad, observing the Ruliad from the outside, if you could do that, you would have

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
some conclusion about how complicated the universe is. But it actually, we're observers with some

20:18.000 --> 20:25.920
very particular characteristics. For example, we are computationally bounded. Our minds are sort of,

20:26.000 --> 20:30.720
you know, we have finite number of neurons, 100 billion neurons, whatever it is, we're bounded

20:30.720 --> 20:35.840
in the computations we can do. And we already know, you know, I studied a bunch, the second

20:35.840 --> 20:41.600
order of thermodynamics, law of entropy increase and so on. And that's a case where we, what we

20:41.600 --> 20:46.800
observe is that all those molecules bouncing around, they seem to us random in the motions that they

20:46.800 --> 20:52.400
have. Now, if we were to trace molecule by molecule and trace all the computations about how all the

20:52.400 --> 20:57.520
molecules interact, we would say, they're not random. They follow very particular rules and we

20:57.520 --> 21:02.080
can work out what they are. We can work out what the molecules will do. But the point is that,

21:02.080 --> 21:08.240
as computationally bounded observers, we can't do that. So we kind of have to throw up our hands and

21:08.240 --> 21:15.120
say, it looks random to us. And that's sort of an example of how being an observer of the kind

21:15.120 --> 21:20.720
that we are necessarily leads us to certain conclusions about the way the world is. That

21:20.720 --> 21:26.000
is, we believe in the second order of thermodynamics, because we are computationally bounded observers

21:26.000 --> 21:33.200
observing this kind of irreducible computation of these molecules bouncing around. And so that

21:33.200 --> 21:38.640
then leads us to the question of, well, given certain assumptions about us as observers,

21:39.360 --> 21:44.160
what does that mean about the physics we can perceive? And I think there are two key

21:45.200 --> 21:50.320
sort of features of us as observers, although I think there are other ones that seem so obvious

21:50.720 --> 21:54.560
that they've never really been called out as assumptions about how the world works.

21:55.120 --> 21:58.880
But the two that I think are critical for 20th century physics, at least,

21:59.440 --> 22:04.400
one is that we're computationally bounded, and the other is that we believe we are persistent in time.

22:05.360 --> 22:13.760
So it is not self-evident that we believe that there is a consistent thread of us

22:13.760 --> 22:19.440
that goes through time, even though in this model of physics, at every moment we're made of

22:19.440 --> 22:27.520
different atoms of space and so on. Even despite that, we believe that we persistently exist through

22:27.520 --> 22:33.200
time. Well, it turns out that those two assumptions, computational boundedness and persistence through

22:33.200 --> 22:39.840
time, those two assumptions with the mathematical structure of the Roulillade are sufficient to

22:39.840 --> 22:45.760
give us the three fundamental theories of 20th century physics, which to me is completely

22:45.840 --> 22:53.920
remarkable, because the fact that it is possible to derive laws of physics is something that is

22:53.920 --> 22:59.600
at some level very surprising. I mean, the three kind of fundamental laws that we're talking about

22:59.600 --> 23:06.320
that are the cornerstones of 20th century physics are statistical mechanics, where the main event is

23:06.320 --> 23:12.800
the second law of thermodynamics, general relativity, theory of spacetime, and quantum mechanics.

23:13.600 --> 23:20.320
And what has been believed in the past, what was believed from the 1860s on, is that look,

23:20.320 --> 23:25.200
statistical mechanics, the second law of thermodynamics should be derivable in some way

23:25.200 --> 23:29.280
from the laws of mechanics. Once you know how all these molecules bounce around,

23:29.280 --> 23:34.560
it should just be a matter of pure mathematical derivation to show that they satisfy the second

23:34.560 --> 23:42.000
law. Nobody's succeeded in showing how that works. In the end, I think the reason is that to understand

23:42.000 --> 23:47.280
it requires understanding about observers and computational irreducibility and computational

23:47.280 --> 23:52.880
validness and so on, which is a rather different kind of set of concepts than people were pursuing

23:52.880 --> 23:58.480
in mathematical physics. But the thing that is then very surprising is general relativity and

23:58.480 --> 24:05.760
quantum mechanics, both of these were seen by me as well as everybody else as kind of wheel-in

24:05.760 --> 24:10.320
features of the universe. That is, we could have had a universe that has general relativity,

24:10.320 --> 24:14.560
we could have had a universe that doesn't have general relativity, likewise quantum mechanics.

24:14.560 --> 24:21.760
But what seems to be the case is that for observers like us, it is inevitable that what we

24:21.760 --> 24:28.720
perceive must be a universe which has those particular laws. So now you ask, well, what's

24:28.720 --> 24:36.000
the foundation of that? I mean, the Rulliard, in some sense, it's a necessary object. It's not an

24:36.000 --> 24:43.200
object that is like, well, it happens to me this way. It is sort of as necessary as the fact that

24:43.200 --> 24:50.080
2 plus 2 equals 4, given our definition of what 2 is and what plus is and so on. It's not, that's not

24:50.080 --> 24:55.040
something we can wiggle out of. That's not something we can say, well, on Mars, 2 plus 2 might not be

24:55.040 --> 25:01.760
equal to 4. Given our definitions, it is inevitable. And so, similarly with the Rulliard, given the

25:02.080 --> 25:06.800
kind of the concept of computation, the abstract concept of computation, the Rulliard is a

25:06.800 --> 25:11.440
necessary object. Strangely, it's an object and it surprises me as well as other people

25:11.440 --> 25:16.560
that hadn't been studied before. It's an object that, in some sense, is an obvious object to

25:16.560 --> 25:20.640
consider. I think the reason it wasn't studied, certainly the reason I haven't studied it,

25:20.640 --> 25:27.040
is because, in a sense, computation, well, in my lifetime, computation has been gone from being

25:27.120 --> 25:33.680
super valuable to being somewhat every day. But the profligate wasting of computation done by the

25:33.680 --> 25:40.080
universe is something that it took me a while to kind of come to terms with. That is that there

25:40.080 --> 25:45.600
could be, you know, all of this computation happening that is all irrelevant to, that's all

25:45.600 --> 25:50.880
way below anything that we perceive. And that that was, and that there are all these different

25:50.880 --> 25:56.000
branches of history and different rules being followed and so on. And that that, you know,

25:56.000 --> 26:00.560
that sort of the universe is just doing all this computation was something that seems,

26:02.080 --> 26:07.200
it felt like, well, actually, we should concentrate on the particular computation that we care about.

26:07.200 --> 26:16.160
But in any case, I think the, so what's, I think you write that the Rulliard is sort of in its

26:16.160 --> 26:22.400
origins is not a reverse engineering natural science effort. It is a, you know, a bottom up

26:22.400 --> 26:28.960
effort of this is an abstract object, does it now relate to what we see in the world?

26:28.960 --> 26:34.000
And as I say, in my personal history, you know, the fact that I ended up thinking about science in

26:34.000 --> 26:40.400
those terms is a is a consequence of the of the of the pure coincidence that, you know, I worked

26:40.400 --> 26:45.680
on sort of building computational tools for which I had to think about things sort of from the bottom

26:45.680 --> 26:51.120
up. After I happened to learn about a bunch of things about sort of top down natural science.

26:52.080 --> 26:59.120
Mm hmm. Well, that was wonderful. My hope, and I'll give you a break now, my hope with this time

26:59.120 --> 27:06.480
is to get pretty deep into Rulliology, which is a new word for me. You've already taken us there and

27:06.480 --> 27:12.160
presaged a lot of the things that I wanted to discuss. Before I go on, though, maybe I ought to

27:12.160 --> 27:18.560
just, I have this quote here, it's basically a slogan, just to get maybe a sort of definition

27:18.640 --> 27:25.520
of the Rulliad on the board for our listeners. And so you wrote that the Rulliad may be defined as

27:25.520 --> 27:31.360
the entangled limit of everything that is computationally possible, i.e. the result of following

27:31.360 --> 27:38.160
all possible computational rules in all possible ways. Yes, returning to what you were saying,

27:38.160 --> 27:44.480
I'm not a philosopher of science. But like most people, I've read the structure of scientific

27:44.480 --> 27:52.960
revolutions by by Kuhn a number of times. And what really struck me about what you were saying is

27:54.400 --> 28:04.320
how closely this story sort of mirrors his picture of revolutions in some ways. So you

28:04.320 --> 28:11.120
started out working in in normal science, so to speak, we already had these established

28:11.680 --> 28:17.920
programs, general relativity and quantum field theory. And my understanding is that this is really

28:18.640 --> 28:25.040
where some of the other theories of everything emerge from. So string theory comes out of

28:25.040 --> 28:31.600
modeling the strong force, so on, and so forth. But then, yeah, and then the path integral

28:32.320 --> 28:39.120
is a key part of causal set theory. But then a young person comes along. And of course,

28:39.120 --> 28:48.880
you were well versed in these theories. But you throw it all away. And I think your words were,

28:48.880 --> 28:56.480
you realize that you could construct a theory from nothing. And this is like the revolutionary

28:56.480 --> 29:02.720
effort. And the normal scientists do not like this. And as you put it, like a lot of people

29:03.680 --> 29:08.720
hated that you were going off and doing this in a completely different way.

29:08.720 --> 29:13.920
I don't know if I have the book on my shelf. I don't know if it was in a project to find the

29:13.920 --> 29:20.560
fundamental theory of physics, or it was it was in one of your posts on your website. But there was

29:20.560 --> 29:27.920
this really funny cartoon where a dragon with cellular automata for teeth is about to chomp

29:27.920 --> 29:33.360
down on a physicist who's writing equations in a blackboard. And I think this came out around the

29:33.360 --> 29:39.120
time a new kind of science came out. You know, I just looked at this again when we were working on

29:39.120 --> 29:43.440
the physics project and I was trying to try to explain its background. It was a review of a

29:43.440 --> 29:48.080
new kind of science in the New York Times. It was a very, it was actually a very well written review

29:48.080 --> 29:56.480
and a sensible review by a journalist. But the, I hadn't looked at this for, you know, for 20 years,

29:56.480 --> 30:01.840
and I'd completely forgotten what was in it. But the thing that, you know, and at the time,

30:02.400 --> 30:06.800
I was like, you know, why would my friends, the physicists, you know, they might not care about

30:06.800 --> 30:12.400
what I'm doing? Why would there be any kind of negativity about it? And then I'm looking back

30:12.400 --> 30:17.920
20 years later at this cartoon and, you know, realizing that from the outside, from the point of

30:17.920 --> 30:25.600
view of this journalist writing this, this review, it seemed obvious to him that what this was was,

30:25.600 --> 30:33.680
you know, as you put it, the dragon, you know, about to eat the sort of mathematical physicist.

30:34.400 --> 30:40.640
But I think, you know, it's a funny thing because, for example, our physics project,

30:40.640 --> 30:46.320
and now what's led to the Rulliard and so on, there are a whole series of sort of personal,

30:46.960 --> 30:56.560
I don't know, circumstances that led to that path being a possible path, any one of which,

30:56.560 --> 31:02.000
had they not been there, that path simply wouldn't have happened. And, you know, the fact that I've

31:02.000 --> 31:07.680
sort of alternated between doing basic science and doing technology development, the technology

31:07.680 --> 31:14.880
development drives this desire to kind of understand computation at a fundamental level for practical

31:14.880 --> 31:21.280
reasons. You know, it's a somewhat strange kind of set of circumstances. And I think

31:22.640 --> 31:31.600
you're right that the, I mean, the traditional, you know, physics went through a big kind of

31:31.600 --> 31:39.200
transformation in the early part of the 20th century. And that transformation was, you know,

31:39.760 --> 31:44.640
a lot of paradigmatic change. After that time, there wasn't a lot of paradigmatic change. There

31:44.640 --> 31:51.440
was a lot of difficult technical work, but it was within that established paradigm. And it's,

31:52.240 --> 32:00.720
you know, I think the fact that we have, you know, my own efforts, you know, had somebody said to me

32:00.720 --> 32:06.240
when I was in the middle of doing these things, you know, are you sort of purposefully inventing

32:06.240 --> 32:11.840
a new paradigm? I would say absolutely not. I'm just, you know, pursuing things using methods

32:11.840 --> 32:18.400
and techniques that I understand. What happened as I was writing my book, a new kind of science,

32:18.400 --> 32:23.680
I did realize somewhere in the middle of that, gosh, this is a different approach to science.

32:23.680 --> 32:31.280
That actually wasn't my, you know, initial take on things. And but that was, you know, in a sense,

32:31.280 --> 32:37.040
what I realized was that the, you know, in the sort of the long view of sort of history of science,

32:37.040 --> 32:42.800
there'd been a long period starting in the 1600s, when mathematics and sort of things like calculus

32:43.360 --> 32:49.760
were the dominant way of explaining things in nature. I mean, there had been methods from

32:49.760 --> 32:54.800
antiquity just saying, this is what things are made of. But then we had the sort of mathematical

32:54.800 --> 33:01.440
mathematicalization of exact science. And the thing the question was, well, you know, is there more,

33:01.440 --> 33:08.240
so to speak? And this was a realization. Yes, there is more. And in a sense, it was a thing

33:08.240 --> 33:14.400
that was obvious, given the ambient technology of our time, namely, you know, computation, that

33:14.400 --> 33:20.560
doing mathematics, it's sort of ironic that I've, you know, spent lots of effort sort of making

33:20.560 --> 33:29.440
mathematics doable by computer. And yet, the in a sense, the bigger picture is the computation,

33:29.440 --> 33:35.760
not sort of this specific corner of it that ends up being the mathematics that we've currently done.

33:38.000 --> 33:45.360
In our, in our last conversation, we talked a bit about the formal mathematical dimensions

33:45.360 --> 33:49.120
of the roulette and how it connects to mathematical logic. But I wonder if you think

33:49.680 --> 33:58.720
that maybe one way of putting the crux of this paradigm shift and how science is performed

33:58.720 --> 34:05.440
goes back to something you said earlier, but it's sort of an adoption of a formal mathematical

34:05.440 --> 34:11.200
framework. The way people do math, formal math, where computational theory has its home, where

34:11.200 --> 34:16.320
as you put it, though, physics is derived, laws of physics are derived, rather than

34:17.360 --> 34:22.720
being reconstructed based on experiment, the way that it has been done in the past.

34:23.280 --> 34:30.400
Yeah, I mean, I think it's worth realizing that it's a funny difference of paradigms between

34:30.400 --> 34:36.400
mathematics and physics. I mean, we could do axiomatic physics. We could say, you know,

34:36.400 --> 34:42.160
a bunch of experiments, we don't care what's underneath, we're just going to figure out,

34:42.160 --> 34:47.760
you know, how to piece together one experiment and another. In mathematics, we are doing,

34:47.840 --> 34:52.480
we are doing, you know, we often have thought of mathematics as an axiomatic business,

34:52.480 --> 34:56.960
where we simply say, you know, we put down these particular axioms, and then we see

34:56.960 --> 35:01.120
their consequences. We don't necessarily, in physics, we think there's a there there,

35:01.120 --> 35:06.720
we think there is a physical universe that's sort of underneath the things that we observe.

35:06.720 --> 35:11.680
In mathematics, you know, the prevailing view from the early 20th century had been,

35:12.240 --> 35:20.720
it's just you make up your axioms, and then you work out their consequences as a purely

35:20.720 --> 35:28.000
formal kind of thing. I think the thing that I sort of realized is that this process of working

35:28.000 --> 35:35.040
out the consequences of axioms is the same kind of process as this process of figuring out what's

35:35.040 --> 35:41.760
going to happen in the physical universe based on sort of these abstract structures, and the

35:41.760 --> 35:48.880
particulars of, oh, well, you've got sort of kind of symbolic expressions versus you've got

35:48.880 --> 35:55.120
hypergraphs, none of that matters. They're all, it's kind of all a big bucket of equivalent things.

35:55.680 --> 36:02.160
And what's really going on in mathematics, as in physics, is that you are, you know,

36:02.160 --> 36:08.240
to derive one theorem from another, you are sort of applying rules to get from that one

36:08.240 --> 36:13.280
theorem to the other theorem, just as in physics, you're applying rules to get from one state of

36:13.280 --> 36:19.040
the universe to another. So in the end, kind of the structure that you build, that is the kind

36:19.040 --> 36:25.200
of underlying structure of mathematics, is in fact the same structure. It's just this really odd

36:25.200 --> 36:30.480
structure. And sort of it's a weird thing, because in physics, we're used to thinking about, for

36:30.480 --> 36:37.120
example, space in bulk. We don't, we're not, we're not personally, you know, acquainted with the

36:37.120 --> 36:42.880
individual atoms of space. We don't give them names. In mathematics, in sort of axiomatic way

36:42.880 --> 36:48.080
of thinking about it, we have things which are like the atoms of space. There's things even below

36:48.080 --> 36:55.280
axioms, but let's take the level of axioms. But we give these particular sort of points in

36:55.280 --> 37:00.400
mathematical space, we give them names, it's so and so is theorem or whatever else. We actually

37:00.400 --> 37:05.120
don't tend to think of mathematics in bulk. You know, in the history of human mathematics,

37:05.120 --> 37:10.560
people have proved, I don't know, few million theorems. There's, this question is, what is the

37:10.560 --> 37:15.200
limiting structure of mathematics? If we just went on proving theorems, and we had a quadrillion

37:15.200 --> 37:21.120
theorems, what would we, what would mathematics be like? And there's sort of this, and both

37:21.120 --> 37:29.200
mathematics and physics are, I think, rooted in the Rulliad. They're both stories of what are the

37:29.200 --> 37:34.640
consequences of possible computations. The big difference between mathematics and physics is

37:34.640 --> 37:39.360
that the way we're sampling the Rulliad for physics is different from the way we're sampling it

37:39.360 --> 37:45.920
from mathematics. So in physics, we are these kind of computationally bounded observers,

37:46.000 --> 37:52.320
sort of progressing through time and experiencing through time. I think in mathematics, the better

37:52.320 --> 37:58.640
view of the mathematical observer, still computationally bounded. But instead of sort of a progression

37:58.640 --> 38:03.600
through time, there's more like, it's almost spatial, but not quite. There's sort of a,

38:03.600 --> 38:09.040
you're putting more and more theorems in your bag of things you believe. So instead of, I'm

38:09.040 --> 38:15.600
experiencing the history of my life, I'm kind of progressively sort of putting more things that I

38:15.680 --> 38:23.120
believe are true into my bag of, a bag of beliefs, so to speak. And that that's kind of the, the, the

38:23.120 --> 38:28.400
sort of progression of mathematics looks like that. And there are all kinds of, you could ask, well,

38:28.400 --> 38:33.120
what are mathematical observers like? Can we conclude things about the structure of mathematics?

38:33.120 --> 38:39.920
Just as from the nature of physical observers, we can conclude things about sort of global laws of

38:39.920 --> 38:46.160
physics. Are there global laws of mathematics, for example? Mathematics, as we normally practice it,

38:46.160 --> 38:51.760
is a kind of theorem to theorem kind of business. Whereas it's not a thing where we make bulk

38:51.760 --> 38:57.360
statements about the structure of all possible theorems and so on. And sort of, but in physics,

38:57.360 --> 39:01.440
we're not talking about physics at the level of individual atoms of space, or even at the level

39:01.440 --> 39:06.240
of individual molecules when we're doing some dynamics, for example, we're talking about sort

39:06.240 --> 39:11.200
of bulk properties. And so there's sort of a question, what are the, what are the bulk laws

39:11.200 --> 39:17.440
of mathematics? The first bulk law of mathematics, I think, is that high level mathematics is possible,

39:18.000 --> 39:23.600
which is not obvious. In other words, if you look at what, I don't know, a proof assistant system is

39:23.600 --> 39:29.040
doing something, automated theorem proving system, you're looking at you say, let's, let's look at

39:29.040 --> 39:34.240
mathematics at the level of really low level axioms, let's go all the way down to the sand

39:34.240 --> 39:39.680
and start trying to build up mathematics. The, you know, that is a deeply inhuman activity.

39:40.240 --> 39:44.720
I mean, it's a long time to find it. Yeah, but, but right, but it's also,

39:44.720 --> 39:53.520
it's something where the typical thing you do that, you know, is it's made from tiny pieces

39:53.520 --> 39:57.760
as a human looking at what's done by the computer, it's incomprehensible. Oh, right.

39:57.760 --> 40:05.520
And, right. And it's some, you know, and I think the, and when you build up, if you want to build

40:05.520 --> 40:11.440
up something that, you know, humans might talk about right on blackboards, you're talking millions,

40:11.440 --> 40:17.520
billions, quadrillions of individual little axiomatic steps. Right, right. Humans can't

40:17.520 --> 40:23.360
read formal proofs. Right. Normal, like, mathematical proofs that mathematicians

40:23.360 --> 40:29.360
use are so not rigorous compared to what a formal mathematician would take as rigorous,

40:29.360 --> 40:34.560
and even what they do is not at all what a computer would be reading at that.

40:34.560 --> 40:40.640
Right, right. So I mean, you know, you can build up the structure of a completely formalized proof,

40:40.640 --> 40:46.560
but it is way below the level of human mathematics. So, you know, I think the analogy that's useful

40:47.200 --> 40:52.240
is to fluid mechanics, where there is a molecular dynamics, there are individual molecules bouncing

40:52.240 --> 40:57.680
around, but we humans do not experience that we humans experience the overall flow of fluids and

40:57.680 --> 41:03.520
things like this. And so it is with mathematics, I think, I think that deep but that that sort of

41:04.080 --> 41:10.560
foundational axiomatic layer, it's not what we experience. You know, for example, we routinely

41:10.560 --> 41:16.000
will talk about the Pythagorean theorem. What do we exactly mean by that? You know, what definition

41:16.000 --> 41:20.480
of real numbers are we using? What axioms are we using for this or that thing about set theory and so

41:21.440 --> 41:26.080
it doesn't matter. It's, you know, we can still talk about the Pythagorean theorem,

41:26.080 --> 41:32.080
and we can do kind of human level fluid dynamics level mathematics, just batting around features

41:32.080 --> 41:37.680
of the Pythagorean theorem without always grinding ourselves down and looking at the molecules,

41:37.680 --> 41:41.920
so to speak, looking at those sort of individual microscopic axiomatic pieces.

41:42.480 --> 41:48.400
And that I think is sort of the first sort of big law of mathematics is that that's possible,

41:48.400 --> 41:53.200
that it is possible to do mathematics at the level of the Pythagorean theorem,

41:53.200 --> 41:58.160
rather than at the level of the microscopic axioms of set theory and so on. You don't have to,

41:58.160 --> 42:03.920
you don't have to go down to that level. And I think that's a, you know, that's a feature of

42:03.920 --> 42:11.440
sort of mathematical observers like us, just as physical observers like us believe in space,

42:12.160 --> 42:19.280
believe in thermodynamics and so on. So it is, I think, that mathematical observers like us

42:19.840 --> 42:24.960
believe in kind of higher level mathematics. And, you know, it's sort of interesting because

42:24.960 --> 42:31.040
there are places where we run into problems with that. You know, when we look at, you know,

42:31.040 --> 42:35.360
when we run into undecidability in mathematics, when we run into Beatles theorem and so on,

42:35.360 --> 42:42.320
those are places where we hit the edges. We can't look at things at the level of the sort of pure,

42:42.320 --> 42:47.760
the sort of fluid dynamics where we just can, we're somehow forced to look down to that lower

42:47.760 --> 42:54.160
sort of mathematical level. And I think that, you know, it's, that's a question that sort of

42:54.160 --> 43:00.240
seeing down to the foundations of mathematics in a way that most mathematicians in their daily

43:00.240 --> 43:05.200
work, they just don't care. That's, that's not important. And I for a long time, I was very

43:05.200 --> 43:10.640
confused about why undecidability is so rare in mathematics. You know, that is, you know, we've

43:10.640 --> 43:16.960
known since 1931, there are, you know, there are theorems whose proofs are arbitrary, long,

43:16.960 --> 43:21.840
infinite, unprovable from a given set of axioms and so on. Why doesn't that, you know, when,

43:21.840 --> 43:25.280
when it comes to figuring out the piece of mathematics that somebody cares about,

43:25.280 --> 43:33.040
why is there a finite proof of it? And, you know, the, I sort of was, because for example,

43:33.040 --> 43:39.200
when you look in the computational universe possible programs, many things you see there are,

43:39.200 --> 43:45.520
you run right into undecidability. You, you know, many questions you might ask, there's no finite

43:45.520 --> 43:51.600
computation that can answer them, etc, etc, etc. So why isn't this more common in mathematics?

43:51.600 --> 43:57.600
And I think the reason is because mathematics, as we practice it, is the sampling of the Rulliard

43:57.600 --> 44:03.200
done by mathematical observers like us, who, by the very nature of us as computation-bounded

44:03.200 --> 44:09.920
observers, has, have this feature that we end up sort of believing in this higher level,

44:09.920 --> 44:15.360
sort of fluid dynamics level mathematics. And that that's sort of why it's, it's because

44:16.080 --> 44:21.520
if, if we were different kinds of observers who were looking down at the level of those

44:21.520 --> 44:27.920
individual computations, we would be continually confronted with undecidability as we are when

44:27.920 --> 44:32.880
we study sort of arbitrary things in the computational universe. But when we study things of the kind

44:32.880 --> 44:39.680
that are, can be studied by a mathematical type observer, we end up most of the time just being

44:39.680 --> 44:44.960
able to operate kind of fluid dynamics level without being forced down to this level where

44:44.960 --> 44:51.680
there's lots of undecidability. And I think, so I mean, there's a, there's a lot of

44:53.360 --> 44:57.840
this, the thing that, again, is, is sort of, I think, perhaps philosophically interesting

44:58.400 --> 45:03.680
is this, you know, does mathematics exist in some sense? You know, is there a there there for

45:03.680 --> 45:12.160
mathematics? And, you know, my, my belief nowadays would be that there's as much there there for

45:12.160 --> 45:18.000
mathematics as there is for physics. You know, in physics, we just have this intuitive sense

45:18.880 --> 45:25.040
that there is a universe out there that is sort of an objective thing that's out there. And,

45:25.680 --> 45:32.960
you know, what, what, what one's saying is that, well, in the end, there's the really out out there,

45:32.960 --> 45:40.080
but the sort of the way that we, the sort of the experiences we have are a consequence of the fact

45:40.080 --> 45:45.440
that we're observers of the kind that we are. And the same, that the same is true for mathematics.

45:46.800 --> 45:50.480
You, you said, just like, just a minute ago, you said that you think this is

45:50.480 --> 45:56.640
philosophically interesting. And I can confirm that it is a philosophical gold mine. And I mean,

45:56.640 --> 46:03.360
this is a good example of how this new kind of science might require a new way of thinking

46:03.360 --> 46:07.920
of doing or thinking about philosophical questions. I mean, not just in philosophy of

46:07.920 --> 46:13.120
mathematics or philosophy of science, but in metaphysics and epistemology and all of these

46:13.120 --> 46:17.920
areas. But for the moment, though, I'd like to stick with science because there are some really

46:17.920 --> 46:22.880
big questions there and some big distinctions that I'd like to clear up. And the first is between

46:23.600 --> 46:30.960
theory and object. And I mean, I suppose one might define physics as it has been done

46:31.520 --> 46:37.280
so far as the study of matter and energy and the fundamental building blocks of the world.

46:37.360 --> 46:43.600
But there's a distinction between the theories that a physicist develops and then the world that

46:43.600 --> 46:50.800
they describe. But I hear when I hear you talk, I hear about the Ruliad as an object, like the

46:50.800 --> 46:57.520
world or the universe, or a multiverse, maybe, but it also seems like it's our fundamental

46:57.520 --> 47:03.680
theory of the world in a way too. So the question is, what the physicist, what the physicist is

47:03.680 --> 47:10.720
doing here? Is the physicist developing theories that describe the Ruliad or is sampling and

47:10.720 --> 47:17.440
understanding the Ruliad, sampling and understanding the theory itself? Or do these things break down?

47:17.440 --> 47:22.560
It's sort of a question of what is science? What is natural science? And the way I see it is,

47:22.560 --> 47:28.960
natural science is kind of a translation layer between kind of the underlying computation,

47:28.960 --> 47:35.280
the underlying world as it is, and the stuff that we can sort of talk about and think about with

47:35.280 --> 47:42.720
our minds. So in other words, what we've got kind of the things that are just happening out there,

47:43.280 --> 47:48.560
and we've got our way of describing what's happening. And I think that the fundamental

47:48.560 --> 47:54.080
role of natural science is to figure out of all the stuff that's happening out there, what can we

47:54.080 --> 48:00.080
parse out that we can package in such a way that we can kind of have a narrative about it in our

48:00.080 --> 48:05.040
minds? I mean, there is something that's just happening out there. But the question is, what is

48:05.040 --> 48:10.800
it that we, you know, how do we talk to ourselves about what's happening out there? And we are only

48:10.800 --> 48:15.920
sampling tiny pieces of what's happening out there. But I think to your question about sort of,

48:15.920 --> 48:22.160
it's almost, I was surprised that I was able to say anything about this, but the why does the

48:22.160 --> 48:27.840
universe exist question? You know, because there's, you know, you can say, well, I've got this theory,

48:27.840 --> 48:34.320
but why is the theory actualized? In what sense, you know, what breathes the fire into the universe,

48:34.320 --> 48:40.400
so to speak? What, you know, what is, and, you know, I suppose from a, and I don't know all the

48:40.400 --> 48:45.520
philosophical history here, but, but, you know, I certainly know the quote from Spinoza about,

48:45.520 --> 48:51.440
you know, the universe is the thoughts of God actualized, so to speak. And it's, it's kind of,

48:51.440 --> 49:00.000
you know, it's, it's a, this question of what is, how does one think about sort of,

49:01.520 --> 49:10.320
what is actualization in a situation where what we somehow, and I'm, this is, this real-time

49:10.320 --> 49:16.560
philosophy is a bit, is a bit too hard, I think, but it's, I know when, you know,

49:18.000 --> 49:21.760
my mother was a philosophy professor, which caused me to say that if there's one thing

49:21.760 --> 49:25.360
I'll never do when I'm growing up, it's being a philosopher. But one of the things that,

49:25.360 --> 49:31.440
one of the many things that I sort of would give a hard time to about some, about philosophy was that

49:31.440 --> 49:36.880
the, you know, the Oxford philosophers would give a talk and they would read every word of this talk.

49:36.880 --> 49:41.600
And it's like, that's very, you know, that's very wooden, you know, you can do better than that.

49:42.560 --> 49:47.680
But actually when you have to really, you know, get all these distinctions correct,

49:47.680 --> 49:53.440
it's actually pretty hard to do that in real time. So it's, it's, so I'm, I'm,

49:54.640 --> 50:00.640
but this question about sort of, okay, so I think on this question about sort of why does the

50:00.640 --> 50:08.080
universe exist? Why is anything actualized? I think that the way to think about that is

50:09.440 --> 50:14.800
there isn't really a question of why the Ruliat exists any more than there's a question of why

50:14.800 --> 50:21.760
2 plus 2 equals 4 exists, right? It's just an abstract thing. So now the real question is sort of

50:23.280 --> 50:29.680
then we have the sort of a prior knowledge that we are perceiving this thing, we are here

50:29.680 --> 50:37.040
perceiving this thing. It is in a sense less obvious that we should exist than that this

50:37.040 --> 50:43.360
abstract thing should exist. But, but in a sense by the very fact that we're here doing the perceiving,

50:44.080 --> 50:51.120
we know that if we want to describe something as existing, we, you know, we know that we're here,

50:51.120 --> 51:00.000
so to speak. And so I think the kind of the, the why, why is there a, you know, I suppose it comes

51:00.000 --> 51:10.560
down to asking why, you know, why is the universe, why is there a perception of something like the

51:10.560 --> 51:17.120
universe out there that we have access to? And my, I think the answer would be that it is

51:18.080 --> 51:24.320
the Ruliat is this inevitable thing. The given that you know that we're here as observers,

51:24.880 --> 51:30.720
you know, having a perception of things, it is inevitable that the things of which we have can

51:30.720 --> 51:36.640
have a perception are these are is this abstract object, because the abstract object doesn't,

51:36.640 --> 51:42.320
you know, the abstract object is the only thing we have to argue, the only contingent fact,

51:42.560 --> 51:48.800
and even this gets more complicated. The only contingent fact is that we are computational

51:48.800 --> 51:59.200
and not, for example, hyper computational. That is the fact that we exist as a place in the Ruliat.

51:59.760 --> 52:05.040
So the Ruliat is sort of this entangled limit of all possible computations,

52:05.760 --> 52:11.760
computation, something that follows rules. But as we start to say, what precisely do we mean by that?

52:12.320 --> 52:17.440
We might say follows rules like a Turing machine, or like a cellular autonomous or like a network

52:17.440 --> 52:23.040
rewriting system, those are all equivalent. Those are all computations of the standard thing that

52:23.040 --> 52:28.320
we refer to as computation. But if we're just thinking about it, we can say, well, let's take

52:28.320 --> 52:34.720
things that are undoable in finite time by any computational system set up in this way. Let's

52:34.720 --> 52:41.600
just say we have a magic box that can do those those hyper computations do computations do in

52:41.600 --> 52:47.200
finite time, computations that would take an infinite time for any computational system of

52:47.200 --> 52:55.440
the kind that we're describing. Let's say that we have a hyper computational system. Well,

52:55.440 --> 53:00.000
then we could start building up a Ruliat from hyper computation as well. We can build up a

53:00.000 --> 53:05.840
hyper Ruliat, we can build up an infinite collection of hyper Ruliat. So the question

53:05.840 --> 53:13.280
that is again, not I think is a contingent fact about the world. Okay, there's going to be an

53:13.280 --> 53:18.320
interesting footnote to this. But the initial observation would be the fact that we are in

53:18.320 --> 53:25.280
the Ruliat and not in the hyper Ruliat is something that is no more derivable than the fact that we're

53:25.280 --> 53:30.880
in this galaxy rather than some other galaxy. And it's just we happen to be here. That's the first

53:31.280 --> 53:36.000
first level of I don't so much like that explanation. And as I said, I think, well,

53:36.000 --> 53:41.840
we're about to about to come to an even more bizarre point, which is but but but so

53:43.040 --> 53:49.520
and and well, we say, Well, what about let's just go observe the hyper Ruliat? Well, you can't do that

53:49.520 --> 53:57.040
from inside the Ruliat is kind of an event horizon that prevents you ever having any kind of causal

53:57.040 --> 54:02.400
connection to things in the hyper Ruliat. By the way, there's a whole hierarchy of these things.

54:02.400 --> 54:10.800
Within our universe, there are things that don't have all of the kind of richness of our universe,

54:11.440 --> 54:18.480
namely, black holes, you know, you know, I wrote a piece about about cats. So we'll have to talk

54:18.480 --> 54:24.800
about that. Yeah, right. They, which is relevant to the Ruliat, but we'll, we'll, we'll get to that

54:24.800 --> 54:28.160
perhaps. The in the case that the thing that

54:30.800 --> 54:35.360
the thing is sort of interesting, perhaps, is we have our universe, which is sort of a

54:35.360 --> 54:43.200
computational kind of thing. And then we have things like black holes. And one feature of sort

54:43.200 --> 54:48.720
of the simplest kind of black holes is time stops. In other words, in our universe, we believe

54:48.720 --> 54:53.200
time just keeps going, keeps going, keeps going. But in a typical black hole with a space like

54:53.200 --> 54:59.200
singularity, there's a time just stops. In our models, it's pretty easy to see how that works.

54:59.200 --> 55:05.760
There are these rewrite rules, and there's just no rules to apply. But the point is that what would

55:05.760 --> 55:09.920
in our universe would be this thing where we say, well, you can have arbitrary long proofs,

55:09.920 --> 55:16.240
you can have arbitrary long sort of experiences of the universe. And if you are stuck inside a

55:16.240 --> 55:22.000
black hole, you don't have that. So similarly, from the point of view of the hyper Ruliat,

55:22.080 --> 55:29.440
our whole Ruliat's worth of experience looks like a black hole. It looks like gosh, you can't,

55:29.440 --> 55:35.040
it's not quite time is finite in the sense that well, time is time is infinitesimal relative to

55:35.040 --> 55:41.120
the what can be achieved in all the time of our universe is infinitesimal compared to what can

55:41.120 --> 55:48.320
be achieved in a moment of time in the hyper universe. And so that okay, so now one of the

55:48.320 --> 55:54.080
things which is again one of these. So you say, well, we got the Ruliat, we got the hyper Ruliat,

55:54.080 --> 55:59.600
why did we get stuck in the Ruliat? Why didn't we have a, you know, why aren't we in hyper Ruliat

55:59.600 --> 56:07.040
numbers such and such? I'm pretty sure that there is a notion of Rulial Relativity, that basically,

56:07.040 --> 56:14.720
once you are an observer that have certain level of computational capability, that it is your

56:14.720 --> 56:21.600
experience of the world is necessarily the same. In other words, if you're an observer in any level

56:21.600 --> 56:30.320
of the hyper Ruliat, you are your, you know, when you perceive things, you will, if you're in a

56:30.320 --> 56:36.880
hyper Ruliat, then your perceptions are hyper relative to what they would be in our Ruliat.

56:36.880 --> 56:44.880
But if you are, but that you match the level of Ruliat that you're in. And so I think, I mean,

56:44.880 --> 56:49.920
we still need to work out the details of this, but I think that it's going to end up that it

56:49.920 --> 56:55.520
doesn't matter, that you're, that kind of, that there is no, that that removes that piece of

56:55.520 --> 57:01.040
contingency, so to speak. But I'm not sure, let's see, I forget how we got to this now, but

57:01.200 --> 57:11.200
but the, I mean, we're talking about kind of the necessity of the, well, the existence of the

57:11.200 --> 57:16.400
universe, why is it necessary that the universe should exist? And my claim is that these abstract

57:16.400 --> 57:28.640
constructs necessarily exist. And that the, the once you, the question of whether, well, okay, so,

57:29.200 --> 57:33.600
I think I managed to get a bit further than this, and I'm, I'm trying to remember what the,

57:33.600 --> 57:38.480
what all the arguments were here. But this, this question of whether,

57:40.240 --> 57:45.440
yeah, the issue is, within the Ruliat, why is there a thing that is like an observer?

57:46.800 --> 57:54.080
Why should, why should there be anything that is like an observer like us? And I think that,

57:54.640 --> 58:00.080
so, so one question is, what does an observer like us fundamentally do? And I think the answer is,

58:00.800 --> 58:07.040
what observers do is they take the complexity of the world, and they try and stuff it into a finite

58:07.040 --> 58:13.440
mind. Because, you know, there is all the stuff going on out there, but we don't perceive that

58:13.440 --> 58:19.760
stuff. We perceive this tiny, you know, tiny trickle of information. I mean, we're, you know,

58:19.840 --> 58:24.880
the photons falling on our eyes, there are zillions of them every second. But yet,

58:24.880 --> 58:30.640
all we perceive is I'm looking at a face or something. In other words, we are equivalencing

58:30.640 --> 58:34.400
and the same thing in a much more physical setting. Imagine we're trying to measure the

58:34.400 --> 58:39.120
pressure of a gas, and we have a piston, we got some, you know, and all the gas molecules are

58:39.120 --> 58:43.360
hitting the piston. And there's a zillion configurations of these gas molecules. But all

58:43.360 --> 58:47.840
that matters in measuring the pressure of the gas is what the aggregate force on the piston is.

58:48.480 --> 58:54.160
And so that, that measuring process is equivalencing a large number of states of the world.

58:54.800 --> 58:58.960
And I think that's, that's the essence of a computationally bounded observer,

58:59.600 --> 59:06.800
is that you have to equivalence lots of states of the world to stuff your experience of the world

59:06.800 --> 59:12.800
into, you know, a finite mind, so to speak. And so then the question is, you know, you start

59:12.800 --> 59:19.600
asking, well, you know, are there pieces of the Rulliard, are there pieces of what's possible

59:19.600 --> 59:27.600
that we can interpret as kind of a thing that is equivalencing things and, and sort of reducing

59:27.600 --> 59:36.560
them to something where we can, where, where we can interpret it in this way. And I think it's

59:36.640 --> 59:43.040
one of the features, one of the sort of scientific facts is this phenomenon that within any

59:43.040 --> 59:49.120
computationally irreducible system, there are necessarily an infinite number of lump of sort

59:49.120 --> 59:54.480
of pockets of computational reducibility. So to unpack that a bit. So given that you have a set

59:54.480 --> 01:00:02.320
of rules, and you say, I'm going to run these rules, you might say, if we know the rules for a system,

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.920
then we're done. We know how the system's going to behave. And that was what people sort of assumed

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:14.400
was true. But it isn't true. Because what happens is the working out of those rules involves a

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:20.160
certain amount of computation. And it can involve an irreducible amount of computation. So if you

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:25.200
say, I want to know what's going to happen a million years from now, it's like, sorry, the only way

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.960
you can work that out is to live through those million years and do all those computations.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:35.360
That is not, you know, the conceit of mathematics in a sense, is you just solve the equation,

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.640
or you fill in the numbers in the formula and you're done. There is a quick way to work out what's

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.520
going to happen. But the difference, the fundamental difference between sort of the mathematical

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.800
paradigm for thinking about science, I think, and the computational one is in the computational one,

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:56.160
you're given a rule, and then you have to run it to find out its consequence. It's not,

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:03.520
you can just nail it and have something which is kind of finite mind narrative of this is the

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:09.680
mathematical result. So there's this phenomenon of computational irreducibility. It is, I think,

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:18.480
it is a really central phenomenon. I mean, if there's one thing that I think is sort of a

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.600
takeaway from lots of things that I've done, it's the idea of computational irreducibility,

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:30.400
because it's what leads to, you know, it has consequences all over the place. It has consequences

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:37.440
for, well, for things like free will, it has consequences for, you know, if we say, if there

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:44.640
wasn't computational irreducibility, then the passage of our lives and the passage of time

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:49.760
would not really mean anything. Because we'd always be able to say, you know, you lead your life,

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:56.800
you live out many decades or whatever, but the answer is 42, you know the end, you can just jump

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:03.840
to the end. The fact that we have to experience all of those intermediate steps is a consequence of

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.640
the phenomenon of computational irreducibility. It's also in a quite different domain, you know,

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:13.520
if you're thinking about, you know, AI, and you say, I'm going to put in these rules for AI

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:18.880
governments, and they're going to work perfectly. It's like, well, no, they're not, because there

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:24.400
will always be an unexpected thing that happens, because the working out of those rules will show

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:30.720
computational irreducibility. And it's computational irreducibility is a completely ubiquitous thing

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:38.480
among systems rules. But the thing then that's surprising, okay, so given computational irreducibility,

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:44.720
why is science possible? In other words, why is it possible to make statements about the world

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:50.720
that are useful narratives of finite minds? It, you know, you might say it's just hopeless,

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:58.960
we can't figure out anything. The thing that is then a sort of a fact about computational

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:04.000
irreducibility, it is inevitable that within a computational irreducible system, there'll be

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.640
an infinite number of pockets of reducibility of places where you can make a little prediction.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:16.640
And if you, it's rather a fairly easy argument that if that wasn't the case, if it was sort of

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:22.720
uniform computational irreducibility, you could use that very fact to make predictions. And so,

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.920
you know, that that sort of diagonal argument gives you gives you this result. But then so that

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:32.000
means there are all these pockets of irreducibility. What are those? What are those? Well, those are

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.880
the places where those are what we live in. You know, the fact that our lives are somewhat our

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:42.480
universe is somewhat predictable is because we're looking at a slice of reducibility in all of this

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:48.320
computational irreducibility. That's throughout the Roulillade, we are sampling a piece of it,

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:54.640
observers like us sample a piece of it that represents a pocket of reducibility. And by the

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.560
way, there are a lot of other things that those sort of pockets of reducibility correspond to,

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.760
like, for example, I think technology, you know, scientific discoveries, technology,

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.560
these are all examples of pockets of reducibility. You know, the world's a complicated place,

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:13.920
but we can make a scientific statement. You know, the fact that science is possible is science is

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:19.680
possible because there are these pockets of reducibility. And that's essentially where,

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:24.800
you know, where the science lives. That's what the science is doing is it's identifying,

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:29.040
you know, these pockets of reducibility. By the way, that has another consequence, which is

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:35.120
science will never be finished. There are always more pockets of reducibility. That's not self

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:40.320
evident, I think. It could be the case that, you know, if it wasn't for computational irreducibility,

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:45.920
then we would say we found the rules of the universe were done. But that's not correct,

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:51.360
because of irreducibility. But it's still got to be the case, even given the irreducibility,

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:56.160
that we can say things, and there'll be an infinite sequence of things we can say. I mean,

01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:00.240
it's the same thing with technology. There's a question of how will, will there be a moment

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:06.240
when every invention has been made? And the answer is no, because inventions are these places where

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:11.120
you're getting sort of your, your making use of some pocket of reducibility. I mean, that the

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:17.360
footnote to that is, one thing that could happen is every invention that we humans care about has

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:24.080
been made. I don't think that happens because I think that the domain that we care about gradually

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:30.160
expands. And I think that's, you know, one thing I, you know, a sort of a little bit of a whimsical

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:36.880
way to talk about it. But, you know, we, the progress of science and sort of the arch of

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:41.680
intellectual history is a story of kind of, you know, additional paradigms, additional ways to

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:46.720
measure things about the world and so on. And the question is, you know, if we look at our,

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:55.040
our sort of presence in the Rulliard as a species or something, one aspect of our expansion is we

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:59.040
send out spacecraft when they go a certain number of, you know, astronomical units away from us.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:07.440
That's exploring physical space. The growth of paradigms, I think, is a growth in Rullial space

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:14.720
that we're gradually sort of putting, there is more, there are more domains of that there's

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:22.560
sort of more descriptions of the universe that we can put in our bag of things that we can stuff

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:30.480
into our minds. So in other words, we're, as we invent a new paradigm, we are able to sample

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.280
where we're, we're sort of exploring more parts of the Rullia, we're exploring more different

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:41.120
kinds of rules that we can use to sort of talk about the universe and so on. So that's, that's

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:48.640
so it's kind of a sort of the expansion of, you know, in, in our, we can, we can make a choice

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:55.600
that you can set up more spacecraft, we can do more theoretical science and, you know, or some

01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:00.320
more experimental science and find, you know, more different kinds of measurements that we can make,

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:07.600
you know, we start some. So these are, we can move farther or get smaller. Yes. Yes. Well, right,

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:12.160
I mean, that's another issue. It's another very interesting thing I think about us as

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:18.160
sort of a contingent fact about us as observers, we're actually pretty big. That is, if we're,

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:23.840
the universe is, you know, 10 to the 26 meters across in physical space, and we're give or take

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:30.800
a meter tall, you know, we kind of think the elementary length, the sort of the, the, an effect,

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:35.680
the effective distance between atoms of space or something might be 10 to the minus 100 meters.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:40.720
So relative to that, where maybe, I don't know, that estimate is right,

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:46.480
where 100 orders of magnitude bigger than we, than the smallest and 26 orders of magnitude smaller

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.960
than the biggest, so to speak. So we're pretty big. And, and there's sort of a question of,

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:58.000
what's that? Good for the ego. Yeah, right. Well, okay, we'll get to, don't get too confident there,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:05.520
because I think we're big in physical space in, in the Rulliard in rural space, we're pretty damn

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:11.760
small. In other words, you know, so one, one sort of way of, of probing that question, really that

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:18.720
the question of how big are we in rural space is the question of, of sort of, how do, what is the

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:24.640
diversity of, of what different kinds of minds can perceive? You know, if we have some point in,

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:30.720
in the Rulliard, then, then with minds of the kind we have, and each of us has a different

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:36.400
mind, so to speak, where all these little points in rural space, humans with similar kinds of,

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:42.720
you know, backgrounds or whatever might be quite close in rural space, your, your cat there is a

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:49.920
little bit further away in rural space. Although, you know, we can recognize, you know, certain

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:55.360
features, the emotional, you know, characteristics of the cat are sort of recognizable to us, even

01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.960
though cat philosophy is probably not something that, you know, if there is a cat philosophy,

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:06.000
we don't, you know, we don't know what it is. And I think it's very tuna-centric.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.960
Yeah, right. That's, that's, you know, I do think that the modern times of machine learning,

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:20.480
one of the things that, you know, the talk to the animals thing should be a thing. The main block

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:28.240
is this question of sort of the, the distance in rural space, the kinds of things that, you know,

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:34.880
that one might talk about may be so bizarrely different, that they're not things where, you

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:39.520
know, it's a, again, it's like science, it's like this translation layer between, you know,

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:45.280
science is a translation between the natural world and what goes in our brains. And this is

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:51.360
sort of a level of a science-like thing that is, you know, the translation from what's going on in

01:09:51.360 --> 01:10:01.680
the animal brain to what's going on in ours. But I think, let's see, we were, yeah, right. So, I mean,

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:08.320
in, you know, this question of how big is the space of possible alien minds? What is the diversity

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:13.760
of possible ways to look at the universe? And I did a little experiment. It's a very, very,

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:23.360
I would say, sort of very basic approach to that question, which is, think about an AI and you're

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:32.160
thinking about kind of a generative AI system. And, you know, the typical image generation AI

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:40.160
system has been trained on billions of human produced images. And then it's generating things

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:46.720
that are like those human produced images. And so you can start asking, well, that's a mind that's

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:51.600
aligned with a human mind, because it's trained from human produced images. But you can like take

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:57.440
that mind and just start changing the weights and the neural network. And then you have something

01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:04.240
which is not quite like, you know, it's kind of, it started from a human mind, but now it's,

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:09.840
it's sort of modified relative to, to that human mind. And you can start asking, well, what are the

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.120
images that you produce in that, in that case? There's even a simple thing you can do. You can

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:24.480
just say every, every image that is generatable is, there's this kind of latent space, there's this

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:33.680
kind of sort of numerically defined, coordinated space of possible images, so to speak. And you

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:40.560
can just say, well, there's a particular region of that space that corresponds to a picture of a cat.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:48.160
And as we change our coordinates in that space, we'll make other kinds of pictures. And so then

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:55.040
the question is, there are some pockets of that space that correspond to human concepts, cats, dogs,

01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:01.520
elephants, whatever, right? And the question would be, if you look at that whole space,

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:07.840
what fraction of the space is covered by those human concepts? So for example, one of the things

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:13.040
that, you know, I made some pictures of is cat island, the, you know, the thing which is

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:19.040
near the concept of a cat. As you go further away, you stop, you see pictures that don't really look

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.560
like cats anymore. And pretty soon they, they degrade into things that are not really recognizable

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:30.560
by us humans as pictures of anything that we know about. So even in the simplest case,

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:37.520
the region of, in a sense, rural space, that there's a small tiny slice of a real space,

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:43.280
but the region that corresponds to concepts that we are familiar with is about one part in 10 to

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:50.960
the 600. So in other words, the stuff, the, the, the part of rural space that we are familiar with,

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:56.720
even in this very simple slicing of rural space is an absolutely infinitesimal fraction.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.760
What's, what else is out? You know, I was referring to it as inter concept space.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:07.920
There is, you know, dotted around the space are concepts that we humans have decided to

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:15.840
invent so far in our, in our sort of civilizational history. But in between those concepts, it's

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:22.960
like interstellar space. There's, there's things that we haven't explored yet. And those are huge

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:29.440
compared to the ones that we already explored. So in some sense, we are that that's a, and by,

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:34.800
but by the way, I mean, what we, what we can imagine is that over the course of time, we will

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:42.720
gradually bring into our kind of domain of knowledge more and more things that are sort of out there

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:48.640
in this, in the space. So, so an example would be, you know, go back 50 years, we're making these

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:54.000
pictures, some things that show up in these pictures are nested fractal patterns. If you

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.840
go back 50 years, and you saw those things, you're just kind of like just shrugging your

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.600
shoulders. I don't know what that is. It's just something I don't really know about or care about.

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.080
Now that we know about fractals and nested patterns, we immediately say, oh, that's a

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:14.080
fractal pattern. And no doubt there are many other things out there in that space, where in time,

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.400
for whatever reason, we may start caring about these things, we may give them names

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:25.200
in our human languages and so on. And, and then that may be part of our sort of domain of things

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:30.880
we think about. I mean, it gives one, there's a sort of a funny twist, which I don't know that I

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:36.400
fully understand yet, which is, you know, you say, well, what's the future of history? Well, it's,

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.600
it's kind of like we explore interstellar space and physical space and so on. And then we explore

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:47.520
the Rulliad. We go on exploring more and more of the Rulliad. And kind of the story of intellectual

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:52.400
history could be the story of sort of just expanding, expanding, expanding the Rulliad space.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.880
They say, well, then eventually we get to this wonderful situation where we've expanded throughout

01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:02.480
Rulliad space, we're done, we've discovered everything. The problem is, I think in that case,

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:09.760
by the time we've expanded our mind to encompass everything, our mind is no longer coherent.

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:17.760
We no longer coherently exist. That is, I think that the, the, you know, coherent existence

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:26.720
requires sort of, in some sense, smallness. If you, if you are everything, then you're not,

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:34.160
there's no coherent you to the whole story. There has to be a, you know, the fact that we,

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:41.280
that we, we have coherent minds that believe that we have definite experiences and things

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:47.600
like that. I think as a consequence of the fact that our minds are not, you know, they're limited,

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:53.040
so to speak. If it wasn't for that, we wouldn't, you know, we wouldn't have this kind of coherent

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:58.640
sense of being us, so to speak. And so I think it's kind of a, a be careful what you wish for

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:03.360
situation, but it's like, yes, we, you know, we just succeeded. We expanded throughout Rulliad space.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:11.200
The problem is now we don't coherently exist. And, you know, I think that's some,

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:16.640
I think that has all sorts of resonance with, with things people talk about in many kind of

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:22.240
Eastern traditions and philosophy and so on, which are, you know, I find it interesting how little

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:28.000
I understand about those things. Because in a sense, that's a story of, of one's kind of limitation

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.040
in Rulliad space. And that, you know, I've grown up in sort of a Western thought tradition, so to

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:38.480
speak. And it's really difficult for me to understand, you know, even if there is some there, there,

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.800
it's, you know, I, with my way of thinking about things, it's like I try and, I try and approach

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:49.360
it with my way of thinking about things and it just doesn't quite fit. I mean, this particular

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:54.720
point is perhaps the point of contact between these kinds of different, different ways of

01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:02.720
thinking about things. Well, these notions of exploring the Rulliad, of sampling the Rulliad

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:09.600
of the translation layer. I mean, it all just raises, it raises so many more classical questions and

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:17.600
epistemology and metaphysics and the philosophy of science. And you said a while ago now that

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:26.000
natural science is what we can parse about what's happening out there. And you also said,

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:34.480
with regard to the Rulliad, I mean, it's this necessary abstract object. And that we have

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:42.720
this perception of it. But where I'm getting at is that physics is generally considered to

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:50.000
concern, I mean, quite naturally, the physical world, though, I mean, physical or material,

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:55.760
these terms, they get a bit murky when one starts talking about things like fields and

01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:03.040
wave functions and so on. But even though I mean, physical objects like the computers we're using

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:10.160
right now, they do carry out calculations and so on. But computation itself is an abstract

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:17.200
process. And the Rulliad itself is to use reference that quote again, the entangled limit

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:21.920
of everything that is computationally possible. So it's like a, it's a collection of equivalence

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:29.920
classes or something of that. And so I wonder then, whether ultimately you view the universe as a

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:35.600
physical object or an abstract object, or these categories just somehow don't make sense anymore

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:40.000
at this level of discussion, or whether we're physical, I think they don't make sense. Because

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:48.720
I think that, you know, all, yeah, I mean, all, all I, all I know is what I perceive. And, you

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:59.040
know, it's not to have the, you know, you might say, that's a very, and I know there are traditions

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:05.040
and philosophy where, where one sort of gets oneself tangled up by thinking that way, and saying

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:10.720
there's no, there's no there outside, so to speak. It's a little different in what I'm talking about,

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:17.840
because there is that there is something there, it's the Rulliad. But it's not this question of

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:30.640
whether there is a, you know, is there a, is there a thing that makes in what sense is, you

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:38.480
know, a solid object more real than some concept of mathematics? I mean, that's, that's kind of the,

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:47.920
you know, they, that I suppose, yeah, I mean, there's this question about what's out there

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:54.000
in physical reality. You know, one of the things we've got to realize is that as we have progressed

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.760
in the history of physics, we've had different kinds of measuring devices. There are things which

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:04.800
where they were presumably features of the universe all along, but we never knew they were there.

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:11.040
And I think that's kind of a, you know, that's the experience of, of saying, you know, so in

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:18.720
what sense is it even worth talking about a thing about the universe that we are completely unable

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:25.600
to perceive? Is that a, you know, you might still say, well, it's there, but we can't perceive it.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:29.760
And so it's not something that's going to be part of the, the canon of our physics.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:36.240
You know, it could be that there are, well, you know, gravitational waves, okay, that's a thing

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:42.720
that wasn't, you know, that, that was a long expected thing. But there could be, you know,

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:51.360
all kinds of, of strange phenomena, you know, that I could imagine, well, for example, in our

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:56.720
models of physics, there are dimension fluctuations. Our universe, we think of it as three dimensional,

01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.960
but actually in our models of physics, it isn't exactly three dimensional, it has little dimension

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:07.760
fluctuations. And that's something that we are not currently, we don't have a good, I don't know

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:13.520
how we measure those, possibly they're related to gravity, possibly they're related to dark matter.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:21.200
But, you know, once we get to the point where we suddenly realize, oh gosh, we can use this method

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:28.880
to take these dimension fluctuations and render them in a way that sort of connects to our minds,

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:33.360
then we've got a whole different set of things that we can talk about in terms of physics,

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:41.040
and a whole different set of things that we can kind of say are, you know, to discuss as, as physical

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:48.320
constructs. But I think it's a question of what, what is it that we can successfully perceive?

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:54.080
Those are the things about which we're going to have a, have a physics discussion. If we can't,

01:21:54.080 --> 01:22:04.480
if we're not perceiving it, we don't, you know, we don't discuss what we don't perceive. And there

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:09.920
might be, and you say, well, there might be things where there's a little, you know, there are a lot

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:14.400
of things which in the history of physics, for example, things about quantum mechanics, where we

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:20.160
just, physics went along for years without ever caring about any of that stuff, until there started

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:26.880
the experiments which rubbed our noses in those phenomena, and which came about, I think, because

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:32.240
of electronic amplifiers and things like that got invented, and that allowed us to amplify small

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:37.760
signals and we could start to detect things we haven't been able to detect before. But I mean,

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:50.560
you know, this, this question of, well, I mean, from a, it's sort of interesting as one, as one

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:55.840
starts to kind of, you know, one of the things that's always challenging is to live the paradigms

01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:02.880
one invents. And, you know, I've, this is a thing which is, honestly, I think it's one of the more

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:08.800
challenging things. It's like, you know, as you have different generations of intellectual thinkers,

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:15.840
it's, you know, it's usually a couple generations later, the people kind of can really sort of,

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:22.640
you know, the paradigm is so obvious to them that you can sort of build on it. And I have to say that

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:30.720
the, the kind of the perception of, of sort of this, this, this idea of the Ruiad and the idea that

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:35.920
all that is real is our perception of, of, you know, our particular perception of it and so on,

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:41.840
the, I'm not sure that I've totally internalized that. I mean, just to talk a little bit about

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:46.960
personal history and the internalization of paradigms, it's, it is interesting to me that,

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:54.480
you know, in my life, at least many kinds of ideas, they take a couple of decades at least

01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:02.320
for one to internalize it. That is, you see a phenomenon, you know, the primary problem of

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:07.280
doing things like experimental science and Ruleology, just studying possible rules in the

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:12.960
computational universe is a kind of experimental science. The challenge of experimental science

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:20.720
is to discover things you didn't expect. Because too often, your, your paradigm for thinking about

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:27.680
things is, is one which makes you blind things that you don't expect. And in fact, this phenomenon

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:34.000
of complicated behavior from simple rules, people had observed that for at least 50 years, if not

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:40.720
longer, before the things that I did, but they just ignored it. They said, oh, we're studying early

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:46.720
neural nets and they sometimes they have noise and the noise is a nuisance. And we want to study,

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:52.560
you know, how do they behave like, like brains that make decisions or something. But, and it's

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:57.280
even the case, you know, when I was first studying these simple rules and their, and their consequence

01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:04.880
is a number of very good mathematicians got involved in doing that. And they said, this is,

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:08.560
you know, we're going to be able to solve this, these are simple rules, we're going to be able to

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:13.760
crack this with mathematics. After a couple of years, they were like, no, we can't say anything,

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:21.360
we give up. Okay. And I suppose that the thing that, in a sense, I realized many years after the

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:27.200
fact is my main intellectual achievement at that moment was to realize the fact that one was giving

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:33.360
up was itself very interesting. I mean, the fact that there was a, you know, a paradigm that was

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.880
all about computational irritability and all these kinds of things that was orthogonal to the

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:44.480
mathematical paradigm, in some sense, or different from mathematical paradigm, that was in itself

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:49.280
very interesting. But it took, you know, I would say that a lot of these kind of,

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:58.480
you know, a lot of these ideas, they take a surprisingly long time for one to kind of internalize,

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:04.880
so to speak. I mean, in, and it's kind of the role in some sense of scientific history is to go back

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:09.440
and look, you know, because there are lots of things I can see from my own history where, you know,

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:16.800
for example, the fact that building this first computational language of mine was important

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:22.800
in the realization that you could build the physics from nothing, so to speak. It took me

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:27.360
several decades after that had happened before I realized that kind of intellectual connection.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:35.680
And, but I think, you know, this question of, of what does it, if one now is thinking about the

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:42.960
world in terms of the Rulliard and perceptions of the Rulliard and so on, how does that make one

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:48.560
feel about one's experience of the world? And, you know, it's, it feels,

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:55.680
and I, you know, I'm at the early stages of understanding that. I mean, I think it kind of,

01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:02.560
you know, I think it's sometimes easier to see the scientific consequences. I mean, there are,

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:11.120
there are broader consequences of things. I mean, like, for example, a, you know, if you look at

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:20.160
sort of a big arc of scientific history, there are, you know, one very dramatic moment inside

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:26.160
of history was sort of the whole Copernican Revolution story, which one can interpret as being,

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:31.520
you know, it's obvious, you know, before that time, it's like, you know, we're on the earth,

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:36.720
the earth is still, you know, is stationary, and we're looking at all these things moving

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:40.640
around the sky, and it's obvious that the earth is stationary. You know, how could it not be,

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:46.000
you know, that is a matter of our common experience. And then, you know, the surprise is,

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.440
you can make up a bunch of math that shows that the earth isn't stationary, so to speak.

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:57.760
And, you know, it's better to think about it as going around the sun. And then it's like, okay,

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:04.640
really, you've got to sort of switch off your common sense and say, the math is going to solve

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:10.880
the problem. It's going to be a, you know, it's a different way of getting access to what's going

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:17.680
on in the world. And I think that, and finally, after a few centuries, people got used to the idea

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:23.120
of so we can calculate stuff. And then people got to this belief that, you know,

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:27.680
then we can calculate everything, you know, we just, we run science a bit longer, and we can

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:32.080
figure out, you know, what's going to happen in this epidemic, or what's this or that, or the other,

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:38.800
you know, we can figure out everything just from, quote, science, science interpreted as

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:44.000
this kind of jump ahead, kind of, we can make a formula for what's going to happen.

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:52.560
I think the thing that, in a sense, if there is a broader significance to figuring out things

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:58.880
about fundamental physics, it's that, you know, in this picture, things are computational all the

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:05.600
way down. And so just as one is forced by sort of the whole Copernican story to say, there's a

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:10.080
certain amount that we just have to figure out with math, and we can't figure out from common

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:15.760
sense. So one is forced by the idea that everything is computational all the way down to say,

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:20.560
so the phenomena that happen in computation are ones that we have to confront. We can't say

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.120
everything we do, you know, yes, there is computational irreducibility in principle,

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.920
but it's not going to be important for for the things that, you know, for, but it's something

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:35.040
that's just out there, and not another thing that that will be relevant to what we're dealing with.

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:42.640
So, you know, I think that's some, yeah, but I mean, you're, you're asking the sort of question

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:50.720
about how does one feel about whether, whether sort of there's a, there's a, there's a thing

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:58.960
out there, and what is that thing? And one, you know, and I, I think this is more a question

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:04.080
of humanly coming to terms with what is essentially an intellectual structure,

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:09.520
than it is a question of, I mean, I think the intellectual structure is, is I like to think

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:15.280
reasonably clear at this point. Now, the question is, how does one come to terms with that intellectual

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:20.160
structure? It's just like saying, you know, at the Copernican time, and, you know, it's like,

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:25.360
there's an intellectual structure that was, you know, now, now we have to come to terms with,

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:32.320
you just calculate it with math, which is totally disorienting. If you're starting from the,

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.280
look, it's obvious that the earth is standing still, so to speak.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:44.000
Well, talking about living with one's paradigms, another paradigm that you're very familiar with,

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.680
and that is notoriously difficult to live with is quantum mechanics. And I mean, it's, it's one

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:55.520
thing to accept that quantum field theory is so successful. And it's another thing to accept

01:30:55.520 --> 01:31:00.960
or really live, I suppose, concepts like entanglement, just to take a common example. And

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:07.120
okay, there are so many fascinating ways in which the Ruliad connects to or derives more

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:10.960
explicitly interesting physics, like that of general relativity and black holes, like you

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:16.720
mentioned a little bit earlier, but to focus on one for a moment. I'm curious about how living

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:22.000
with these two paradigms, the Ruliad and quantum mechanics has been for you in that.

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:31.600
Does it, I'm wondering if accepting the Ruliad forces a specific interpretation of quantum

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:35.760
mechanics on you? Because as I take it, the Ruliad is deterministic.

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:45.600
Yes. So I mean, okay, you know, they, my old friend Dick Feynman was used to say

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:49.520
after spending his life studying quantum mechanics, one of his favorite quotes was,

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:56.720
nobody understands quantum mechanics. And, you know, I think I am inching towards the point

01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:02.080
where I can say I actually understand quantum mechanics. I don't think I'm fully there yet,

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:09.280
but I'm, I'm, you know, at least inching towards it. And I think the, the sort of key observation

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:16.400
is this point about the many parts of history, and the fact that we, in our experience,

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:21.200
span those parts of history, span multiple parts of history, just like we don't cover the,

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:28.000
we don't fill the whole universe. We don't span all possible parts of history, but we span a,

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:34.960
a chunk of parts of history. And that's in a sense, when we say there's so, so, okay, so then

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:43.360
there's the, there's the question, okay, so that one of the issues is, why do we think

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:50.720
that definite things happen? If there are many parts of history, why, why aren't we just living

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:56.480
in a world where many different things are happening? And inside a quantum computer, I think

01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:00.640
that is what's happening. That's what, that's what a quantum computer, you know, inside the mind of a

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:06.160
quantum computer, it has many different things happening. The challenge with a quantum computer

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:10.480
and the challenge of what happens with quantum mechanics is somehow you have to take those

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:17.040
many parts of history and somehow aggregate them to something which is compatible with observers

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:23.040
like us, who believe that definite things happen. And so what is, it's like a measuring device.

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:28.400
It's like the, you know, the molecules hitting the piston. They, all those molecules are doing

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:33.440
different things, but the piston has one uniform kind of thing that it's doing. I think, in the

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:40.080
case of most kinds of quantum measurements, that it's more like a weighing balance. That is,

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:44.800
it's, you know, in the case of the piston, it's just aggregating real numbers and it's eventually,

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:50.240
you know, this is the average pressure type thing in a slightly different, but very similar kind of

01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:54.880
measuring device is a weighing balance, where there are many different ways you can book grains of

01:33:54.880 --> 01:34:00.800
sand on the two sides of the balance. But in the end, it will go to sunk one direction or the other.

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:05.680
And I think that's similar to what's happening in the measuring devices that are used for measuring

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:10.960
things like qubits and so on, where there's sort of this binary decision about, was the spin-off

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:24.160
or down or whatever else. Now, you know, in, if you then ask, so what, you know, when you're

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:33.040
thinking about sort of the rules of quantum mechanics, and you're asking what, you know,

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:39.680
I think the underlying rules of quantum mechanics rather easily map on to this sort of underlying

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:44.320
dynamics of these multi-way systems and many parts of history and so on, that stuff is pretty

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:50.800
directly the path integral. The issue is, can we explain why it's a discretized version of that,

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:56.240
which is quite mathematically interesting, blah, blah, blah. But in the end, it's sort of unsurprising,

01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:02.320
because it's kind of just like the actualization in some sense of their mechanization of things

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:07.840
like the path integral. But then in traditional quantum mechanics, it's been kind of a hundred-year

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:12.880
wimp out, because it's been, it's basically, it's just like, and then there is this idea of measurement,

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:20.480
and we go from the quantum amplitudes to the measured results, and then something definite

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:26.800
happened. And we haven't had to describe, you know, the formalism of quantum mechanics as

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:31.360
mathematically tiptoed around this question of how does the measurement actually happen.

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:38.320
And in our models, there's much better chance to say, let's unpack what's inside the observer.

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:42.400
What is the observer doing? The observer is taking all these different things that can happen,

01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:46.720
all these different threads of history, and they're equivalencing many different configurations,

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:52.240
and they're saying, so the spin was either up or it was down. And now we get to start unpacking

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:56.960
that and saying, well, what were the actual processes that caused that equivalencing to

01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:02.480
happen? Just like in the case of the piston with the molecules and so on, what were the processes?

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:07.520
Well, every molecule that hits the piston causes the piston to deform a little bit. But, you know,

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:13.600
there are effectively sound waves in the piston that are exchanging momentum between the different

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:20.400
places where it gets hit. And it's a rigid thing. And so pretty quickly, it dissipates kind of the

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:24.400
little deformations that come from the individual molecules, and then you have a sort of collective

01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:29.600
motion that occurs. And so similarly, and I haven't done this, and I've been wanting to do this,

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:35.200
is to really go through the sort of the details of how different quantum measurements are made

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:40.880
mechanically, you know, in the lab, what you actually do. And, you know, I've gone through

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:45.120
in qualitative terms, and I think you can kind of trace that it's a bunch of equivalences that

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:50.240
are being done. But then the question is, well, what can you say when you unpack this process of

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:55.360
measurement? What can you then say about quantum mechanics? What additional things can you say?

01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:00.800
For example, you know, will quantum computers work? Or is it the case that what you gain in having

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:06.240
these many parts of history and many sort of parallel threads of computation, you'll lose

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:11.120
by, but then you have to knit all these pieces together. And that takes a lot of effort. And I

01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:17.600
think that's an example of where you get to kind of make a finer sort of a finer statement about

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:22.160
quantum mechanics. Now, you could ask, you know, do we understand why the born rule of quantum

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:27.520
mechanics works? Not completely. We have arguments about it. We have arguments for why it should

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:33.440
work. Have we dotted the i's and crossed the t's not yet? I am confident that that's going to work

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:39.840
out. But we don't, you know, we, it's just, you know, this is one of the challenges. You have a

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:45.280
very foundational theory. And you're trying to get to the point where you can say, go do this

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:49.520
experiment. I mean, there are lots of people who've said to us, you know, we have this giant

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:55.040
telescope. What should we look for? You know, what, what, what actual experiment should we do to look

01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:00.880
for, let's say, dimension fluctuations in the, in the, in the universe as it is, or, or look for

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:08.400
some other kinds of phenomena that our models predict. Problem is that actually going in and

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:14.880
nailing down kind of, you know, what the details of what the telescope should see are is a whole

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:21.040
bunch of work. And it's a big stack of kind of mathematical physics, and other things that

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:25.360
you need to go through. And computational irreducibility is not your friend, as far as the

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:31.760
stuff is concerned. And, you know, that is, we're slowly getting there. We now have nice

01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:36.560
simulations of black hole mergers. We're starting to have simulations of quantum black holes and so

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:40.800
on. But it's a, you know, it's a, it's a whole bunch of work. And lots of people are getting

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:48.720
involved in that, which is nice. But, you know, when it comes to, so, you know, let's reproduce all,

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:56.480
okay, so I can say, in terms of, okay, so I mean, I think the fundamental point about

01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:03.760
quote, understanding quantum mechanics is this idea about broad shield space, this idea that

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:09.920
quantum mechanics is, well, so for example, the fundamental law of quantum mechanics,

01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:14.400
you could say it in different ways, but a nice way is in terms of the Feynman path integral.

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:21.760
And the path integral says that the ample sheet you get out is this, you know, you integrate

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:30.560
over all possible paths, and you take each path is weighted with e to the i times this quantity,

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:36.800
the action divided by h bar plants constant over 2i. So it's, it's a, it's a phase and e to the i

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:42.160
something or other. And the something or other is this action object, which is essentially an energy

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:50.320
density. And so the thing that's really cool is what, what what it's saying is the phase of the

01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:58.560
quantum amplitude is determined by this energy density like thing. And the, well, okay, so in,

01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:06.000
in physical space, the thing we know is that the paths particles take in physical space

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:11.520
are deflected by the presence of gravity, gravity, the source of gravity is energy,

01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:17.760
energy momentum, mass energy momentum, whatever the whole same thing. The, so in other words,

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:27.360
a path taken in physical space is that path is determined by the presence of energy momentum.

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:34.800
It's, it's deflected by gravity. And so now we go to the same thing in Brown-Shield space in this

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:40.560
multiway graph and we're looking at and what turns out to be the case is that the paths in

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:47.360
Brown-Shield space basically are also deflected by the presence of energy. Energy in our models

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:52.560
is essentially the density of updates in this network. So paths in Brown-Shield space are

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:59.120
deflected by the presence of energy. And then I'm sort of skipping lots of pieces here, but, but,

01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:06.160
but basically the, the current, our current belief is that position in physical space,

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:11.360
we understand what that is, that's kind of our common experience of position in physical space.

01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:18.640
Position in Brown-Shield space, we're pretty sure corresponds to quantum phase. So saying that

01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:23.600
the presence of energy momentum deflects paths in Brown-Shield space and so on is basically saying

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:29.600
the presence of energy momentum changes quantum phases, which is essentially what the path integral

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:37.280
is saying. And so the, the, the belief is that what in physical space is the Einstein equations

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:44.800
for space time and gravity and so on in Brown-Shield space, it's the exact same sort of underlying

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:53.360
process, but now it's the Feynman path integral instead. So this is, I mean, I mean, as a, from a

01:41:53.360 --> 01:42:00.000
pure sort of elegance in physics point of view, this is quite spectacular because it means, you

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.960
know, general relativity and quantum mechanics, people have wondered how do they fit together? Well,

01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:09.280
the answer is they're the same theory, that they're the same theory played out in a slightly

01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:13.760
different space. And by the way, there are already echoes of that in what's been done in

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:19.600
mathematical physics, the holography principles and the ADS CFT correspondence and so on between

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:25.120
sort of things in general, so do things in Brown-Shield theory. I think those are, those are kind

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:31.680
of echoes of the exact same phenomenon that there is that in some sense, these two theories are

01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:36.880
really the same theory. And for us, there's this thing called the multiway causal graph,

01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:43.120
which is the kind of the biggest, the big graph where one projection of it is physical space,

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:49.520
another projection of Brown-Shield space. So in a sense, this graph encodes both quantum mechanics

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:55.040
and general relativity, and you're projecting it in different ways to, to get sort of the experience

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:59.920
of different things. So that's, I mean, that's a, but let me give you one more, one more kind of

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:04.640
picture of sort of how quantum mechanics tries to work. So one of the things that's

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:09.920
always confusing in quantum mechanics is things like destructive interference. So, you know,

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:13.920
you have two slits, you have, you know, the photon can go through one slit or it can go

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.400
through the other slit, but you say, well, it can go through either one or the other.

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:23.920
So, you know, by the time you're looking in the center of the, the screen behind these things,

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:27.120
it's, you know, there's got to be something there because after all, it could have gone through

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:30.800
once that it could have gone through the other slit, but how can you end up with nothing there?

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:35.360
How can you end up with destructive interference of the probability of that, that a, that a,

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:42.400
that a photon gets there? Okay. So here's what I think happens. And I think it's bizarrely similar

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:47.200
to a phenomenon in mathematics, actually. Let me, let me explain, let me actually explain

01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:53.680
the phenomenon in mathematics first. Sure. So in, you know, my picture of mathematics is

01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:58.240
the mathematician is, has a bag and they're collecting theorems that they think are true

01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:04.400
and putting them in this bag. The, the, the mathematician with a finite mind only can have

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:10.720
a finite bag of theorems that they kind of coherently think are true. But now imagine that

01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:17.360
you put a false theorem in there. Well, now in sort of from the middle ages, people have said,

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:22.000
you know, material implication, if you have a false premise, you can derive everything.

01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:28.240
This is this kind of idea of, you know, principle of explosion or whatever, that once you, you know,

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:34.240
if you were seeing a false hood, then the, you know, then you can derive any possible,

01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:38.160
any possible result. So what happens to the mathematician when they put a false theorem

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:42.480
in their bag? The answer is that false theorem entails all possible theorems.

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:49.120
So that bag explodes. And so they, the, the, you know, so that their mind explodes in some sense,

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:55.680
they can't, they can't maintain all these things together. So, so that's kind of the, that's sort

01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:02.960
of, so now let's look at the quantum mechanics case. So now what I think happens is that the two

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:08.080
photons, they go to slightly different places in physical space, but in Braunschild space,

01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:14.160
these two photons that both could end up at the center of the screen are at kind of opposite ends

01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:22.160
of Braunschild space. And so the, the observer who is bounded in Braunschild space is trying very

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:27.600
hard to say, well, what happened? You know, I could imagine both photons were there, but to

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:32.560
imagine that I would have to expand my mind in Braunschild space. In fact, I would probably

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:39.840
have to expand it in some idealized way, infinitely. And so just like the mathematician can't put that

01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:47.200
false hood into their bag, so similarly, the observer of these two photons can't conclude

01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:52.560
that they just can't make consistent the picture that the photon went through either one thing or

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:57.360
the other. And so they have to say, didn't, you know, the photon just disappeared, so to speak.

01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:01.920
That's, that's my, but you know, there are, there are lots of, you know, all these different

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:08.160
phenomena of quantum mechanics, you can start to have, I think, almost intuitive kinds of,

01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:14.400
you know, kinds of views of what's going on there. I think it's, I mean, to mention one

01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:19.200
from relativity that I think is very lovely. And by the way, there's an analogy in mathematics here

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:25.120
as well, time dilation and relativity. So, you know, if you are an observer who's going faster,

01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:31.840
time to, to an observer, you know, the time appears to be progressing more slowly to an

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:38.000
observer who's going, going faster, the phenomenon of time dilation. So in our models, you have a

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:44.240
thing, it's represented by some sort of tangle in this network. And the thing is moving in this

01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:50.480
network. Well, the process of motion requires a certain amount of computation. You've got a thing

01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:55.280
in one place, it's got to reconstruct itself in another place, that takes a certain amount of

01:46:55.280 --> 01:47:01.280
computation. But the progression through time also takes a certain amount of computation.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:08.400
And the thing has a certain computation budget, so to speak, that is ultimately determined by the,

01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:13.520
the fundamental processing power of the universe, you know, that's sort of the, the way of measuring

01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:20.320
distances in the ruler. And so this, this, what you end up with is you can either use your

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:27.920
computational effort to sort of progress through time, or you can use it to rewrite your position

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:32.800
in space. But as soon as you're rewriting your position in space, you're using up some of that

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:40.080
budget. And so you don't get to evolve as quickly in time. And so you, you have to, you know, it's a,

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:44.400
that that's, that's why that's sort of the mechanical reason that time dilation happens.

01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:53.680
So in the case of metamathematics, well, okay, let's see, there's, there's sort of a similar

01:47:53.680 --> 01:48:01.440
phenomenon that has to do with, if you were investigating something in one theory, using

01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:06.320
another theory, like algebra and geometry, you were, you were, you're trying to use algebra,

01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:12.240
but you're studying geometry. And you're kind of going back and forth between algebra and geometry.

01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:19.520
There's this translation cost that let's see how does this work. The, I mean, but basically the

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:26.720
time dilation phenomenon comes about because as you are trying to sort of think about geometry

01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:36.000
in terms of algebra, let's say, you are necessarily incurring some, you're slowing down your progress

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000
in geometry, because you keep on having to do this translation back and forth to algebra.

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:46.800
And that's a, that's, I'm not untangle all the pieces to this quite right. But, but that,

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:51.200
I think there's a phenomenon there that is similar to time dilation, which is very weird.

01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:58.080
And, and by the way, these, these correspondences speak to sort of, you know, help convince me

01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:02.480
that this picture that's sort of underneath both mathematics and physics is the same rule

01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:06.800
here. The fact that there are these correspondences makes that encouraging. I mean, another, other

01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:12.640
correspondences that what is a black hole in mathematics, a black hole, I think is a decidable

01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:20.640
theory. So just as in, you know, in physics, there can be unbounded time. So in mathematics,

01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:25.360
there can be unbounded proofs. But by the time you have a decidable theory, the proofs are going

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:32.880
to be bounded. And so that's like a decidable theory is like a black hole. And then, then you

01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:37.520
have an physical space, you have all these singularity theorems that say when you have too

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:43.920
high a density of energy momentum, you inevitably form a black hole. In mathematics, the statement

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:49.120
would be when you have too high a density of proofs, you inevitably end up with a decidable

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:55.920
theory. And so this leads to very bizarre things, like for example, the future of the universe may

01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:01.440
consist of a bunch of black holes, the future of mathematics may consist of a bunch of decidable

01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:07.840
theories. And in other words, that the, that the sort of inexorable future of the universe

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:12.720
sort of is similar to the future of mathematics, so to speak. Another thing corresponding to

01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:20.080
mathematics and physics is homogeneity in the physical world. That is, that we can move around,

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:25.120
you know, we believe that physics is kind of the same here as it is in the Andromeda galaxy.

01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:31.840
In mathematics, the statement would be mathematics is kind of the same in the algebra place as it

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:38.080
is in the geometry place. So in other words, there is a, an inevitable translation from one field of

01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:44.160
mathematics to another. If the mathematical universe is reasonably homogeneous, which I think I can

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:49.760
argue that it is, then it is necessarily the case that there will be these correspondences between

01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:54.560
these very different areas of mathematics. And we see some evidence of this of all these kind of

01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:59.840
dualities between different areas of mathematics and so on. But it's sort of interesting to see that

01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:05.920
homogeneity in physical space, the analogy to that is the presence of these things. And I think,

01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:13.360
by the way, in a recent thing that I've sort of come to, to imagine is that category theory,

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:19.520
for example, which is one example of a kind of a broad sort of structural sort of description of

01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:26.480
lots of areas of mathematics. Category theory is a, is a characterization of a, so one feature

01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:32.640
of category theory is you say, oh, we apply this morphism, then we apply this morphism. And category

01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:37.680
theory says if you can apply this morphism, then that morphism, then there's always a morphism that

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:44.320
just jumps all the way. That's, that's just an axiom of category theory. That axiom can kind of

01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:49.440
denies computational irreducibility. Because if each of those morphisms was a computational

01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:56.640
irreducible step, then to say, oh, but there's just a supermorphism that jumps all the way is to

01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:01.840
kind of say, but we're, you know, that there shouldn't be that supermorphism if you had to go

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:09.760
through all these computational irreducible steps. And so I think that that's, in a sense,

01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:16.160
category theory is a, is a description of computationally reducible sort of, is a,

01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:20.880
is that some kind of meta description of computationally reducible pieces of mathematics.

01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:27.040
And, but it's, it's one of these things that I think is, is, you know, somehow there's a

01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:31.680
correspondence between that and this thinking about sort of homogeneity in mathematical space.

01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:40.080
Time does fly. And this was terrific. Thank you so much again for talking with me. And hopefully

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:45.520
our third round comes closer than the, to the second than the second did to the first. Thanks again.

01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:54.480
Yeah, it was, it was great. Good stuff.
