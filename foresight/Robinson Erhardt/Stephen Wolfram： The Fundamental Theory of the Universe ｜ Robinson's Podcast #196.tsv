0	6080	Hello, this is Robinson Earhart, here with the introduction to Robinson's podcast, number
6080	14800	196. And this episode is with the brilliant Stephen Wolfram, who is the founder and CEO
14800	24080	of Wolfram Research, the creator of Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, and the Wolfram Language. And
24080	29360	among his many other accomplishments, Stephen received his PhD in theoretical physics from
29360	35360	Caltech when he was only 20 years old with the renowned physicist Richard Feynman on his committee.
35920	43360	This is Stephen's second appearance on the show, much to my delight. And in episode 102,
43360	52000	we talked about artificial intelligence, chat GPT, and then there was a lengthy and enjoyable
52000	57680	digression into the philosophy of math. In this one, though, we turn to another of Stephen's
57760	64800	ambitious projects, which is his search for the fundamental theory of physics, and how it has
64800	74400	led him to a very mysterious structure called the rouliad, which is the entangled limit of all
74400	80880	possible computations. That's a mouthful, but we'll get into that in a lot more detail. And
80880	87280	Stephen believes that the rouliad, though I don't want to put words into his mouth, so these are
87280	94960	my words, is the universe or that the universe is part of the rouliad. And observers like us are
94960	102960	simply embedded in the rouliad and experiencing it in different ways. We also, along the way,
103520	110640	get into some ideas in the philosophy of science, some metaphysics about abstract and concrete
110640	117120	objects, and then the foundations of quantum mechanics. A lot of the material that we discussed
117120	123840	can be found in Stephen's book, A Project to Find the Fundamental Theory of Physics, and in
123840	130160	writings on his website, including an article titled The Concept of the Rouliad, links to which
130160	138720	are in the description. He also does plenty of live streams, he posts plenty of other articles,
139520	144080	there are Q&As, so there's also a link to his website where you can find all of these things.
144640	151520	On my end, reviews, likes, comments, subscribes, these are all very much appreciated, and there is
151520	159280	also now a Patreon, a link to which is in the description. If you are interested in supporting
159280	167040	the show, add free episodes, there's an RSS feed to that, and then some very nice show notes and
167040	174000	takeaways. But now, without any further ado, I hope that you enjoy this conversation as much as I
174000	190880	enjoyed having it with Steve. Before we get to the rouliad, I want to start a bit with its history,
191120	198000	which I guess is also your history, and my understanding from talking with string theorists,
198000	205440	causal set theorists, loop, quantum, gravity theorists is that many other theories of everything
205440	211680	have come out of quantum gravity since general relativity and quantum field theory are two
211680	217760	best physical theories, but my understanding is that the rouliad did not come from this direction
217760	223280	at all. So where did your search for the fundamental theory of physics begin?
224720	230240	Well, it's complicated stories. So when I was a teenager, I was interested in physics, and
231920	237920	I became a pro before too very long, and I worked on quantum field theory and general
237920	244960	relativity, basically, particle physics and cosmology and so on. And that was in the late 1970s,
245760	253040	and at that time, I wasn't in the, let's find a theory of everything, I was in,
253040	256720	we have some theories, they're starting to actually work, things like QCD,
256720	261120	things about the early universe and cosmology and so on. Let's figure out the consequences of
261120	267200	these theories. And that was a fertile thing at that time. And it was, I managed to make some
267200	274320	progress on that. Then I got, I was making computational tools that I used, I don't know
274320	279680	why other people didn't use them, but at least at the time, there were these computational
279680	285680	tools for doing calculations in mathematical physics and so on. I used these to great effect.
286320	294000	Then in 1979, I kind of realized I had outgrown all existing computational tools, and well,
294000	299040	next step was build my own. So I started doing that. And that led to this thing called SMP,
299040	305200	which was kind of a forerunner of Mathematica and both in language. And in building SMP,
305200	312080	I kind of was a, this is, I want to make this computational system, what are, think about it
312080	316240	like a natural scientist, what are the kind of primitives of computation from which we can build
316240	324000	this. And so I did that, built the system, practical system, etc, etc, etc. And then I got
324000	331600	back into doing basic science. This is probably 1981 or so. And I had this, you know, this basic
331600	338080	question about sort of where does complexity come from in the universe. And that the sort of the
338080	343520	standard mathematical physics that I knew didn't tell me much about that. Well, I realized, and
343520	347600	this is sort of back projecting history, because at the time I wouldn't have explained it this way.
347600	353440	But the thing I realize now is that the experience of building this computational language SMP
353440	360400	back then, from sort of these abstract computational primitives kind of gave me the meta idea that you
360400	366480	could just sort of construct a theory from nothing, so to speak, that you could construct a theory,
366480	370560	sort of from the ground up, rather than doing what one traditionally does in natural science,
370560	376320	which is to say, look at the universe as it is, and try and say, how does one get to,
376320	381120	how does one reverse engineer the universe as it is. So that kind of experience of building
381120	387600	this computational system from sort of abstract primitives was the thing that kind of got me into
387600	393280	this idea of let's, let's see what happens when we just start from some abstract primitives and
393280	397440	build things from there. What, what do we get? Do we get something that's like the natural world?
397440	401360	Do we get something completely different? And then the big kind of set of discoveries that I made
401360	407920	about these things called cellular automata that are just, you know, simple rules applied to grid
408720	414320	lines of black and white squares and so on, that the big surprise was, if you just do the computer
414320	419840	experiments, you just sort of turn your computational telescope out into the computational universe,
419840	424640	you discover some remarkable phenomena, particularly you discover that even when the rules are very
424640	433520	simple, the behavior is complicated. And so that to me at first, that was a story of kind of the
434160	439280	explaining things in the natural world. How does one explain sort of the complexity of snowflakes
439280	445680	or turbulence and fluid flow? What are the underlying sort of foundational ideas, the kind of
447200	454000	sort of pre physics sort of abstract ideas that lead to this? It's not traditional mathematics,
454000	459360	it's not traditional mathematical physics. It's something different. It, I realized,
459360	464400	was this kind of computational foundation. So I worked on that for a number of years,
464400	472640	then I kind of had a sort of an attempt to build what ends up getting called complexity theory
472640	481040	as a sort of, as an actual activity in the world. And the process of doing that convinced me, okay,
481040	485920	plan B is just figure out a bunch of stuff myself. Let's not wait for the rest of the world to do
485920	489760	this. Let's just figure it out myself. And that led me to start building mathematical
489760	496080	law from language and our company. And also in the end, this book, big book, a new kind of science
496080	504160	that I would now describe as being at its heart, it's a work of Ruleology. It's a given these rules,
504160	510480	what happens in the world. And the big surprise there was that sort of given these rules, the
510480	515040	given very simple rules, there was just a lot of richness in what happened and a lot of general
515040	519280	principles like the idea of computational irreducibility, the principle of computational
519280	525040	equivalence and so on, these kind of emergent general principles that I kind of realized were
525040	532000	there from having done this kind of essentially in a natural history study of Ruleology of kind
532000	537920	of what do rules out there in the computational universe do. Anyway, they're one of the use cases
537920	543360	for this kind of new kind of science based on sort of thinking about things computationally.
543360	548640	One of the use cases like couldn't avoid looking at was fundamental physics, because after all I
548640	554080	knew a bunch about fundamental physics. And the obvious question was, you can see that
554080	558960	from such a simple rule, you can get all this complicated behavior. So now the question is,
558960	564800	well, what about the universe? That's our sort of biggest example of sort of complicated behavior.
564800	570480	Could it to be the result of some very simple rule? Well, the first thing I knew was that
570480	576000	cellular automata weren't going to do it. That was what we know from relativity about the structure
576000	582480	of space and time and so on. Cellular automata say, let's start off assuming we know that sort of
582480	587600	things are laid out in space in a particular way, that they sort of update in time in a particular
587600	593200	way. We've already locked in the structure of space and time as this kind of grid. And that's not how
593200	598880	the universe actually works. Actually, I recently learned that back in the early part of the 20th
598880	603200	century, well, I knew that many physicists believed that, for example, spaces that was
603200	608480	discrete at that time. But I think Heisenberg in particular had a model of kind of discrete cells
608480	613760	in space that's very much like a cellular automata model. And he didn't actually make it work. And
613760	617520	the fact that he didn't had some interesting historical consequences. I didn't I didn't
617520	622480	really know that had been done by him at that time. But anyway, that wasn't going to work. So
623120	629040	early 1990s, I'm sort of thinking about this kind of thing. And the big idea at that time was the
629040	635680	realization that a network is a much more flexible structure from which you can potentially build
635680	642720	space than this sort of fixed grid. So that sort of a technical thing, it's like you imagine
642720	649440	that space is made of just discrete points. And the only thing those points sort of have to say
649440	653520	for themselves is how they're related to other points. So you're building up this kind of network
653520	659920	of relations. And then the result that I knew by the mid 1990s was much like when you look at a
659920	664800	fluid with a bunch of molecules bouncing around, what emerges from that molecular dynamics on a
664800	671040	large scale is fluid dynamics is kind of the large features of fluids. I knew that what emerged
671040	675840	from sort of the small scale of these this network and updates on the network and so on,
675840	680080	what would emerge on the large on a large scale with all sorts of sort of footnotes
680080	686480	was general stability, the structure of space and time as we are familiar with it from 20th
686480	691840	century physics. So it was kind of exciting. I didn't figure out quantum mechanics at that time.
691840	701680	I had ideas about it. I was frankly prejudiced from my own sort of desire, I suppose, to believe
701760	707840	that sort of the the the progress of history is somehow unique. And that there wasn't, you know,
707840	712400	that there weren't lots of copies of us all over the place doing different kinds of things.
712400	719120	And I didn't, you know, I didn't really see how that worked. So then I well, I kind of it was sort
719120	725040	of my my friends in physics at that time were like, like, you know, we hate the fact that you're
725040	729680	going off to this completely different idea about how fundamental physics might work from the
729680	734240	mathematical physics that we've all been doing for the last, you know, 50 or 100 years. And
734800	738560	so I was like, okay, fine, you know, the market doesn't want this, I'm going to go off and do
738560	743360	other things. So I worked on both Malphyr and computational language and all sorts of things
743360	751760	like that. 20, what was it, 2018, I guess, I kept on coming back to thinking about this kind of,
751760	757840	you know, what could one make progress with in fundamental physics. And the the thing that
758800	763920	that then happened was I sort of realized that there was some with some things I didn't like,
763920	767440	there were kind of arbitrary and the way that I done these set up these networks and things,
767440	772640	I made some progress, thinking about hypergraphs instead of ordinary graphs and so on, that helped
772640	778240	sort of unlock various technical aspects of things. Then 2019, a couple of young physicists who knew
778240	783040	about what I've been doing were like, you know, you can't just leave this project undone, you know,
783120	787200	you got to go forward and actually actually do something with this. And so that led to
787840	793200	something that went vastly more quickly than I expected in 2019 of building up our physics
793200	799520	project and actually understanding about how quantum mechanics works and turned out the thing
799520	805280	that I was afraid of doesn't actually happen for reasons that I could not did not previously foresee.
805920	813200	But the, okay, so so how does that work? This is a long tangled tail. I mean, the sort of big,
814320	821280	you know, the next big sort of injection of of kind of confidence building was the fact that
821920	828480	we seem to be able to reproduce the main features of 20th century physics from this underlying
829120	836960	completely abstract infrastructure. And but then there was still a problem, because the problem was,
836960	841520	I thought at first, we're searching for the fundamental rule, the fundamental computational
841520	849040	rule from which our universe comes. But that always bothered me, because it's like, we get to that,
849040	855040	it's kind of the end of Copernicanism in some sense, you know, we were, we keep on being told,
855120	859680	we're not special, you know, our planet isn't the center of the universe, etc, etc, etc.
859680	864080	So then if we find this rule, and it's one particular rule, we can hold it in our hands,
864080	869680	and maybe it's a simple rule that seems to us simple, why did we get the simple rule universe
869680	874160	and not some completely different universe. So that really bothered me for a long time. And as
874160	879200	is usually the case with these kinds of things, that, you know, it's like, I don't know how I'll
879200	885280	explain that, it's kind of like, in, you know, when Newton was doing sort of celestial mechanics,
885280	889920	we're saying, well, once the planets are set in motion, I can work out what happened. But,
889920	894080	you know, how did they get into their initial configuration? You know, that's the work of God,
894080	899680	so to speak, was what he said at that time. Same with Darwin trying to figure out, you know,
900720	907040	sort of the natural selection, but how did the first life come about? In both of these cases,
907120	913440	what we know from sort of the long run of history is that sort of the, it was a thing from outside
913440	919520	the systems that they were thinking about, that led them to eventually led people after them to be
919520	924960	able to understand, you know, how could a solar system form, etc. etc. etc. So in this case,
925520	935040	the thing that we realized was that this idea that you're searching for the rule, and then you
935040	941440	have to say, well, why this rule and not another, it's just not the right question. The, what's,
941440	948160	what's really going on, I think, is that all possible rules are being run. Now, we had a big
948160	953680	tip off to this, because in this network, and the network is continually getting rewritten,
953680	958160	and you're getting a new network at every moment in time, there are many different ways that that
958160	965040	rewriting can happen. And that leads to many different parts of history, where you've got this
965040	969040	network, it can be rewritten one way, it can be rewritten another way, those are two different
969040	974800	branches. After a while, the, the ways that it can get rewritten may end up with the exact same
974800	979840	network, two different branches may end up producing the same network. So then you have a merge in
979840	984720	this, in this thing, we call a multirate graph, which is this kind of graph of the histories,
984720	991280	possible histories of the universe, not possible, the graph of histories of the universe. And, and so
991280	996720	the kind of the, the first big tip off is that we're not looking for the history of the universe,
996720	1004480	we're looking for this graph of these different histories of the universe. And, and in some sense,
1004480	1011200	the sort of the, I suppose, ontological sort of view of this is they're all happening. It's not
1011280	1016640	that we picked a particular one, it's they're all happening. And then the realization is that as
1016640	1024160	observers of the universe, we, our, our minds are also doing this kind of branching and merging
1024160	1028720	that the rest of the universe is doing. So this kind of how do we perceive the universe, it's the
1028720	1034720	story of how does a branching and merging mind perceive a branching and merging universe. And
1034720	1040960	that story ends up essentially being the story of quantum mechanics. And it's so, so kind of
1040960	1046000	this idea that we are an extended thing with respect to what we call branchial space, the
1046000	1052960	space of possible branches of history. So, so that was, that was kind of the, the realization there.
1052960	1058560	Then we realized, well, but you can take this even further, rather than taking a particular rule and
1058560	1064880	applying it in all possible ways. Let's just consider all possible rules. Now the question is,
1064880	1070480	so how do we perceive the thing you get from studying sort of the evolution of all possible
1070480	1075920	rules? You might say, how can you say anything definite from a thing where all possible rules
1075920	1083360	are happening? Well, it is in fact, a very rigid structure. You might think it's a big floppy thing,
1083360	1088000	because everything can sort of in some sense, everything can happen. But there is a dynamics
1088000	1094160	to it. It's not as if everything can sort of happen all at once. It's that there is, you know,
1094160	1099040	this thing happens, then that thing happens, there is a chain of causality about what happens.
1099680	1106400	And yes, it's sort of all possible chains to be followed. But there's, there's still a sort of a
1106400	1113920	very rigid structure to this whole system. And so then the, that thing, that sort of entangled
1114560	1123520	limit of all possible computations is what we call the Ruliad. And so now the point is that what one
1123520	1131280	has to think about is, if that's what there is, in some sense, what do we perceive about what there
1131280	1137840	is? Because we are part of the Ruliad. So the question of what we perceive about the universe
1137840	1142800	is a question of how do we, there's a certain kind of observer of the Ruliad. We're not observing
1142800	1149120	the whole Ruliad. We are observing some tiny little piece of the Ruliad. It's very much like in
1149120	1154320	physical space, we're sitting on this particular planet, you know, in this particular corner of
1154320	1160000	some particular galaxy. And so our perception of the universe is based on that particularity of
1160000	1165120	where we are. And there isn't really a theory of where we are, we are where we are, we can go and
1165120	1170720	trace back and say, well, you know, our galaxy evolved in this or that way. But, you know, once
1170720	1176560	we know where we are, so to speak, then we have a certain perception of the universe. And the point
1176560	1184240	is, the realization is, it's the same story with the Ruliad. That is, we are, we as observers are
1184240	1193280	sort of, we are taking a particular tiny slice of the Ruliad. Now, the big question is, so can we say
1193280	1200160	anything sort of scientifically based on this? And the thing that I realized is that, that the key
1200240	1206720	observation is that for, it depends on what kind of an observer you are. If you were an observer
1206720	1212000	outside the Ruliad, observing the Ruliad from the outside, if you could do that, you would have
1212000	1218000	some conclusion about how complicated the universe is. But it actually, we're observers with some
1218000	1225920	very particular characteristics. For example, we are computationally bounded. Our minds are sort of,
1226000	1230720	you know, we have finite number of neurons, 100 billion neurons, whatever it is, we're bounded
1230720	1235840	in the computations we can do. And we already know, you know, I studied a bunch, the second
1235840	1241600	order of thermodynamics, law of entropy increase and so on. And that's a case where we, what we
1241600	1246800	observe is that all those molecules bouncing around, they seem to us random in the motions that they
1246800	1252400	have. Now, if we were to trace molecule by molecule and trace all the computations about how all the
1252400	1257520	molecules interact, we would say, they're not random. They follow very particular rules and we
1257520	1262080	can work out what they are. We can work out what the molecules will do. But the point is that,
1262080	1268240	as computationally bounded observers, we can't do that. So we kind of have to throw up our hands and
1268240	1275120	say, it looks random to us. And that's sort of an example of how being an observer of the kind
1275120	1280720	that we are necessarily leads us to certain conclusions about the way the world is. That
1280720	1286000	is, we believe in the second order of thermodynamics, because we are computationally bounded observers
1286000	1293200	observing this kind of irreducible computation of these molecules bouncing around. And so that
1293200	1298640	then leads us to the question of, well, given certain assumptions about us as observers,
1299360	1304160	what does that mean about the physics we can perceive? And I think there are two key
1305200	1310320	sort of features of us as observers, although I think there are other ones that seem so obvious
1310720	1314560	that they've never really been called out as assumptions about how the world works.
1315120	1318880	But the two that I think are critical for 20th century physics, at least,
1319440	1324400	one is that we're computationally bounded, and the other is that we believe we are persistent in time.
1325360	1333760	So it is not self-evident that we believe that there is a consistent thread of us
1333760	1339440	that goes through time, even though in this model of physics, at every moment we're made of
1339440	1347520	different atoms of space and so on. Even despite that, we believe that we persistently exist through
1347520	1353200	time. Well, it turns out that those two assumptions, computational boundedness and persistence through
1353200	1359840	time, those two assumptions with the mathematical structure of the Roulillade are sufficient to
1359840	1365760	give us the three fundamental theories of 20th century physics, which to me is completely
1365840	1373920	remarkable, because the fact that it is possible to derive laws of physics is something that is
1373920	1379600	at some level very surprising. I mean, the three kind of fundamental laws that we're talking about
1379600	1386320	that are the cornerstones of 20th century physics are statistical mechanics, where the main event is
1386320	1392800	the second law of thermodynamics, general relativity, theory of spacetime, and quantum mechanics.
1393600	1400320	And what has been believed in the past, what was believed from the 1860s on, is that look,
1400320	1405200	statistical mechanics, the second law of thermodynamics should be derivable in some way
1405200	1409280	from the laws of mechanics. Once you know how all these molecules bounce around,
1409280	1414560	it should just be a matter of pure mathematical derivation to show that they satisfy the second
1414560	1422000	law. Nobody's succeeded in showing how that works. In the end, I think the reason is that to understand
1422000	1427280	it requires understanding about observers and computational irreducibility and computational
1427280	1432880	validness and so on, which is a rather different kind of set of concepts than people were pursuing
1432880	1438480	in mathematical physics. But the thing that is then very surprising is general relativity and
1438480	1445760	quantum mechanics, both of these were seen by me as well as everybody else as kind of wheel-in
1445760	1450320	features of the universe. That is, we could have had a universe that has general relativity,
1450320	1454560	we could have had a universe that doesn't have general relativity, likewise quantum mechanics.
1454560	1461760	But what seems to be the case is that for observers like us, it is inevitable that what we
1461760	1468720	perceive must be a universe which has those particular laws. So now you ask, well, what's
1468720	1476000	the foundation of that? I mean, the Rulliard, in some sense, it's a necessary object. It's not an
1476000	1483200	object that is like, well, it happens to me this way. It is sort of as necessary as the fact that
1483200	1490080	2 plus 2 equals 4, given our definition of what 2 is and what plus is and so on. It's not, that's not
1490080	1495040	something we can wiggle out of. That's not something we can say, well, on Mars, 2 plus 2 might not be
1495040	1501760	equal to 4. Given our definitions, it is inevitable. And so, similarly with the Rulliard, given the
1502080	1506800	kind of the concept of computation, the abstract concept of computation, the Rulliard is a
1506800	1511440	necessary object. Strangely, it's an object and it surprises me as well as other people
1511440	1516560	that hadn't been studied before. It's an object that, in some sense, is an obvious object to
1516560	1520640	consider. I think the reason it wasn't studied, certainly the reason I haven't studied it,
1520640	1527040	is because, in a sense, computation, well, in my lifetime, computation has been gone from being
1527120	1533680	super valuable to being somewhat every day. But the profligate wasting of computation done by the
1533680	1540080	universe is something that it took me a while to kind of come to terms with. That is that there
1540080	1545600	could be, you know, all of this computation happening that is all irrelevant to, that's all
1545600	1550880	way below anything that we perceive. And that that was, and that there are all these different
1550880	1556000	branches of history and different rules being followed and so on. And that that, you know,
1556000	1560560	that sort of the universe is just doing all this computation was something that seems,
1562080	1567200	it felt like, well, actually, we should concentrate on the particular computation that we care about.
1567200	1576160	But in any case, I think the, so what's, I think you write that the Rulliard is sort of in its
1576160	1582400	origins is not a reverse engineering natural science effort. It is a, you know, a bottom up
1582400	1588960	effort of this is an abstract object, does it now relate to what we see in the world?
1588960	1594000	And as I say, in my personal history, you know, the fact that I ended up thinking about science in
1594000	1600400	those terms is a is a consequence of the of the of the pure coincidence that, you know, I worked
1600400	1605680	on sort of building computational tools for which I had to think about things sort of from the bottom
1605680	1611120	up. After I happened to learn about a bunch of things about sort of top down natural science.
1612080	1619120	Mm hmm. Well, that was wonderful. My hope, and I'll give you a break now, my hope with this time
1619120	1626480	is to get pretty deep into Rulliology, which is a new word for me. You've already taken us there and
1626480	1632160	presaged a lot of the things that I wanted to discuss. Before I go on, though, maybe I ought to
1632160	1638560	just, I have this quote here, it's basically a slogan, just to get maybe a sort of definition
1638640	1645520	of the Rulliad on the board for our listeners. And so you wrote that the Rulliad may be defined as
1645520	1651360	the entangled limit of everything that is computationally possible, i.e. the result of following
1651360	1658160	all possible computational rules in all possible ways. Yes, returning to what you were saying,
1658160	1664480	I'm not a philosopher of science. But like most people, I've read the structure of scientific
1664480	1672960	revolutions by by Kuhn a number of times. And what really struck me about what you were saying is
1674400	1684320	how closely this story sort of mirrors his picture of revolutions in some ways. So you
1684320	1691120	started out working in in normal science, so to speak, we already had these established
1691680	1697920	programs, general relativity and quantum field theory. And my understanding is that this is really
1698640	1705040	where some of the other theories of everything emerge from. So string theory comes out of
1705040	1711600	modeling the strong force, so on, and so forth. But then, yeah, and then the path integral
1712320	1719120	is a key part of causal set theory. But then a young person comes along. And of course,
1719120	1728880	you were well versed in these theories. But you throw it all away. And I think your words were,
1728880	1736480	you realize that you could construct a theory from nothing. And this is like the revolutionary
1736480	1742720	effort. And the normal scientists do not like this. And as you put it, like a lot of people
1743680	1748720	hated that you were going off and doing this in a completely different way.
1748720	1753920	I don't know if I have the book on my shelf. I don't know if it was in a project to find the
1753920	1760560	fundamental theory of physics, or it was it was in one of your posts on your website. But there was
1760560	1767920	this really funny cartoon where a dragon with cellular automata for teeth is about to chomp
1767920	1773360	down on a physicist who's writing equations in a blackboard. And I think this came out around the
1773360	1779120	time a new kind of science came out. You know, I just looked at this again when we were working on
1779120	1783440	the physics project and I was trying to try to explain its background. It was a review of a
1783440	1788080	new kind of science in the New York Times. It was a very, it was actually a very well written review
1788080	1796480	and a sensible review by a journalist. But the, I hadn't looked at this for, you know, for 20 years,
1796480	1801840	and I'd completely forgotten what was in it. But the thing that, you know, and at the time,
1802400	1806800	I was like, you know, why would my friends, the physicists, you know, they might not care about
1806800	1812400	what I'm doing? Why would there be any kind of negativity about it? And then I'm looking back
1812400	1817920	20 years later at this cartoon and, you know, realizing that from the outside, from the point of
1817920	1825600	view of this journalist writing this, this review, it seemed obvious to him that what this was was,
1825600	1833680	you know, as you put it, the dragon, you know, about to eat the sort of mathematical physicist.
1834400	1840640	But I think, you know, it's a funny thing because, for example, our physics project,
1840640	1846320	and now what's led to the Rulliard and so on, there are a whole series of sort of personal,
1846960	1856560	I don't know, circumstances that led to that path being a possible path, any one of which,
1856560	1862000	had they not been there, that path simply wouldn't have happened. And, you know, the fact that I've
1862000	1867680	sort of alternated between doing basic science and doing technology development, the technology
1867680	1874880	development drives this desire to kind of understand computation at a fundamental level for practical
1874880	1881280	reasons. You know, it's a somewhat strange kind of set of circumstances. And I think
1882640	1891600	you're right that the, I mean, the traditional, you know, physics went through a big kind of
1891600	1899200	transformation in the early part of the 20th century. And that transformation was, you know,
1899760	1904640	a lot of paradigmatic change. After that time, there wasn't a lot of paradigmatic change. There
1904640	1911440	was a lot of difficult technical work, but it was within that established paradigm. And it's,
1912240	1920720	you know, I think the fact that we have, you know, my own efforts, you know, had somebody said to me
1920720	1926240	when I was in the middle of doing these things, you know, are you sort of purposefully inventing
1926240	1931840	a new paradigm? I would say absolutely not. I'm just, you know, pursuing things using methods
1931840	1938400	and techniques that I understand. What happened as I was writing my book, a new kind of science,
1938400	1943680	I did realize somewhere in the middle of that, gosh, this is a different approach to science.
1943680	1951280	That actually wasn't my, you know, initial take on things. And but that was, you know, in a sense,
1951280	1957040	what I realized was that the, you know, in the sort of the long view of sort of history of science,
1957040	1962800	there'd been a long period starting in the 1600s, when mathematics and sort of things like calculus
1963360	1969760	were the dominant way of explaining things in nature. I mean, there had been methods from
1969760	1974800	antiquity just saying, this is what things are made of. But then we had the sort of mathematical
1974800	1981440	mathematicalization of exact science. And the thing the question was, well, you know, is there more,
1981440	1988240	so to speak? And this was a realization. Yes, there is more. And in a sense, it was a thing
1988240	1994400	that was obvious, given the ambient technology of our time, namely, you know, computation, that
1994400	2000560	doing mathematics, it's sort of ironic that I've, you know, spent lots of effort sort of making
2000560	2009440	mathematics doable by computer. And yet, the in a sense, the bigger picture is the computation,
2009440	2015760	not sort of this specific corner of it that ends up being the mathematics that we've currently done.
2018000	2025360	In our, in our last conversation, we talked a bit about the formal mathematical dimensions
2025360	2029120	of the roulette and how it connects to mathematical logic. But I wonder if you think
2029680	2038720	that maybe one way of putting the crux of this paradigm shift and how science is performed
2038720	2045440	goes back to something you said earlier, but it's sort of an adoption of a formal mathematical
2045440	2051200	framework. The way people do math, formal math, where computational theory has its home, where
2051200	2056320	as you put it, though, physics is derived, laws of physics are derived, rather than
2057360	2062720	being reconstructed based on experiment, the way that it has been done in the past.
2063280	2070400	Yeah, I mean, I think it's worth realizing that it's a funny difference of paradigms between
2070400	2076400	mathematics and physics. I mean, we could do axiomatic physics. We could say, you know,
2076400	2082160	a bunch of experiments, we don't care what's underneath, we're just going to figure out,
2082160	2087760	you know, how to piece together one experiment and another. In mathematics, we are doing,
2087840	2092480	we are doing, you know, we often have thought of mathematics as an axiomatic business,
2092480	2096960	where we simply say, you know, we put down these particular axioms, and then we see
2096960	2101120	their consequences. We don't necessarily, in physics, we think there's a there there,
2101120	2106720	we think there is a physical universe that's sort of underneath the things that we observe.
2106720	2111680	In mathematics, you know, the prevailing view from the early 20th century had been,
2112240	2120720	it's just you make up your axioms, and then you work out their consequences as a purely
2120720	2128000	formal kind of thing. I think the thing that I sort of realized is that this process of working
2128000	2135040	out the consequences of axioms is the same kind of process as this process of figuring out what's
2135040	2141760	going to happen in the physical universe based on sort of these abstract structures, and the
2141760	2148880	particulars of, oh, well, you've got sort of kind of symbolic expressions versus you've got
2148880	2155120	hypergraphs, none of that matters. They're all, it's kind of all a big bucket of equivalent things.
2155680	2162160	And what's really going on in mathematics, as in physics, is that you are, you know,
2162160	2168240	to derive one theorem from another, you are sort of applying rules to get from that one
2168240	2173280	theorem to the other theorem, just as in physics, you're applying rules to get from one state of
2173280	2179040	the universe to another. So in the end, kind of the structure that you build, that is the kind
2179040	2185200	of underlying structure of mathematics, is in fact the same structure. It's just this really odd
2185200	2190480	structure. And sort of it's a weird thing, because in physics, we're used to thinking about, for
2190480	2197120	example, space in bulk. We don't, we're not, we're not personally, you know, acquainted with the
2197120	2202880	individual atoms of space. We don't give them names. In mathematics, in sort of axiomatic way
2202880	2208080	of thinking about it, we have things which are like the atoms of space. There's things even below
2208080	2215280	axioms, but let's take the level of axioms. But we give these particular sort of points in
2215280	2220400	mathematical space, we give them names, it's so and so is theorem or whatever else. We actually
2220400	2225120	don't tend to think of mathematics in bulk. You know, in the history of human mathematics,
2225120	2230560	people have proved, I don't know, few million theorems. There's, this question is, what is the
2230560	2235200	limiting structure of mathematics? If we just went on proving theorems, and we had a quadrillion
2235200	2241120	theorems, what would we, what would mathematics be like? And there's sort of this, and both
2241120	2249200	mathematics and physics are, I think, rooted in the Rulliad. They're both stories of what are the
2249200	2254640	consequences of possible computations. The big difference between mathematics and physics is
2254640	2259360	that the way we're sampling the Rulliad for physics is different from the way we're sampling it
2259360	2265920	from mathematics. So in physics, we are these kind of computationally bounded observers,
2266000	2272320	sort of progressing through time and experiencing through time. I think in mathematics, the better
2272320	2278640	view of the mathematical observer, still computationally bounded. But instead of sort of a progression
2278640	2283600	through time, there's more like, it's almost spatial, but not quite. There's sort of a,
2283600	2289040	you're putting more and more theorems in your bag of things you believe. So instead of, I'm
2289040	2295600	experiencing the history of my life, I'm kind of progressively sort of putting more things that I
2295680	2303120	believe are true into my bag of, a bag of beliefs, so to speak. And that that's kind of the, the, the
2303120	2308400	sort of progression of mathematics looks like that. And there are all kinds of, you could ask, well,
2308400	2313120	what are mathematical observers like? Can we conclude things about the structure of mathematics?
2313120	2319920	Just as from the nature of physical observers, we can conclude things about sort of global laws of
2319920	2326160	physics. Are there global laws of mathematics, for example? Mathematics, as we normally practice it,
2326160	2331760	is a kind of theorem to theorem kind of business. Whereas it's not a thing where we make bulk
2331760	2337360	statements about the structure of all possible theorems and so on. And sort of, but in physics,
2337360	2341440	we're not talking about physics at the level of individual atoms of space, or even at the level
2341440	2346240	of individual molecules when we're doing some dynamics, for example, we're talking about sort
2346240	2351200	of bulk properties. And so there's sort of a question, what are the, what are the bulk laws
2351200	2357440	of mathematics? The first bulk law of mathematics, I think, is that high level mathematics is possible,
2358000	2363600	which is not obvious. In other words, if you look at what, I don't know, a proof assistant system is
2363600	2369040	doing something, automated theorem proving system, you're looking at you say, let's, let's look at
2369040	2374240	mathematics at the level of really low level axioms, let's go all the way down to the sand
2374240	2379680	and start trying to build up mathematics. The, you know, that is a deeply inhuman activity.
2380240	2384720	I mean, it's a long time to find it. Yeah, but, but right, but it's also,
2384720	2393520	it's something where the typical thing you do that, you know, is it's made from tiny pieces
2393520	2397760	as a human looking at what's done by the computer, it's incomprehensible. Oh, right.
2397760	2405520	And, right. And it's some, you know, and I think the, and when you build up, if you want to build
2405520	2411440	up something that, you know, humans might talk about right on blackboards, you're talking millions,
2411440	2417520	billions, quadrillions of individual little axiomatic steps. Right, right. Humans can't
2417520	2423360	read formal proofs. Right. Normal, like, mathematical proofs that mathematicians
2423360	2429360	use are so not rigorous compared to what a formal mathematician would take as rigorous,
2429360	2434560	and even what they do is not at all what a computer would be reading at that.
2434560	2440640	Right, right. So I mean, you know, you can build up the structure of a completely formalized proof,
2440640	2446560	but it is way below the level of human mathematics. So, you know, I think the analogy that's useful
2447200	2452240	is to fluid mechanics, where there is a molecular dynamics, there are individual molecules bouncing
2452240	2457680	around, but we humans do not experience that we humans experience the overall flow of fluids and
2457680	2463520	things like this. And so it is with mathematics, I think, I think that deep but that that sort of
2464080	2470560	foundational axiomatic layer, it's not what we experience. You know, for example, we routinely
2470560	2476000	will talk about the Pythagorean theorem. What do we exactly mean by that? You know, what definition
2476000	2480480	of real numbers are we using? What axioms are we using for this or that thing about set theory and so
2481440	2486080	it doesn't matter. It's, you know, we can still talk about the Pythagorean theorem,
2486080	2492080	and we can do kind of human level fluid dynamics level mathematics, just batting around features
2492080	2497680	of the Pythagorean theorem without always grinding ourselves down and looking at the molecules,
2497680	2501920	so to speak, looking at those sort of individual microscopic axiomatic pieces.
2502480	2508400	And that I think is sort of the first sort of big law of mathematics is that that's possible,
2508400	2513200	that it is possible to do mathematics at the level of the Pythagorean theorem,
2513200	2518160	rather than at the level of the microscopic axioms of set theory and so on. You don't have to,
2518160	2523920	you don't have to go down to that level. And I think that's a, you know, that's a feature of
2523920	2531440	sort of mathematical observers like us, just as physical observers like us believe in space,
2532160	2539280	believe in thermodynamics and so on. So it is, I think, that mathematical observers like us
2539840	2544960	believe in kind of higher level mathematics. And, you know, it's sort of interesting because
2544960	2551040	there are places where we run into problems with that. You know, when we look at, you know,
2551040	2555360	when we run into undecidability in mathematics, when we run into Beatles theorem and so on,
2555360	2562320	those are places where we hit the edges. We can't look at things at the level of the sort of pure,
2562320	2567760	the sort of fluid dynamics where we just can, we're somehow forced to look down to that lower
2567760	2574160	sort of mathematical level. And I think that, you know, it's, that's a question that sort of
2574160	2580240	seeing down to the foundations of mathematics in a way that most mathematicians in their daily
2580240	2585200	work, they just don't care. That's, that's not important. And I for a long time, I was very
2585200	2590640	confused about why undecidability is so rare in mathematics. You know, that is, you know, we've
2590640	2596960	known since 1931, there are, you know, there are theorems whose proofs are arbitrary, long,
2596960	2601840	infinite, unprovable from a given set of axioms and so on. Why doesn't that, you know, when,
2601840	2605280	when it comes to figuring out the piece of mathematics that somebody cares about,
2605280	2613040	why is there a finite proof of it? And, you know, the, I sort of was, because for example,
2613040	2619200	when you look in the computational universe possible programs, many things you see there are,
2619200	2625520	you run right into undecidability. You, you know, many questions you might ask, there's no finite
2625520	2631600	computation that can answer them, etc, etc, etc. So why isn't this more common in mathematics?
2631600	2637600	And I think the reason is because mathematics, as we practice it, is the sampling of the Rulliard
2637600	2643200	done by mathematical observers like us, who, by the very nature of us as computation-bounded
2643200	2649920	observers, has, have this feature that we end up sort of believing in this higher level,
2649920	2655360	sort of fluid dynamics level mathematics. And that that's sort of why it's, it's because
2656080	2661520	if, if we were different kinds of observers who were looking down at the level of those
2661520	2667920	individual computations, we would be continually confronted with undecidability as we are when
2667920	2672880	we study sort of arbitrary things in the computational universe. But when we study things of the kind
2672880	2679680	that are, can be studied by a mathematical type observer, we end up most of the time just being
2679680	2684960	able to operate kind of fluid dynamics level without being forced down to this level where
2684960	2691680	there's lots of undecidability. And I think, so I mean, there's a, there's a lot of
2693360	2697840	this, the thing that, again, is, is sort of, I think, perhaps philosophically interesting
2698400	2703680	is this, you know, does mathematics exist in some sense? You know, is there a there there for
2703680	2712160	mathematics? And, you know, my, my belief nowadays would be that there's as much there there for
2712160	2718000	mathematics as there is for physics. You know, in physics, we just have this intuitive sense
2718880	2725040	that there is a universe out there that is sort of an objective thing that's out there. And,
2725680	2732960	you know, what, what, what one's saying is that, well, in the end, there's the really out out there,
2732960	2740080	but the sort of the way that we, the sort of the experiences we have are a consequence of the fact
2740080	2745440	that we're observers of the kind that we are. And the same, that the same is true for mathematics.
2746800	2750480	You, you said, just like, just a minute ago, you said that you think this is
2750480	2756640	philosophically interesting. And I can confirm that it is a philosophical gold mine. And I mean,
2756640	2763360	this is a good example of how this new kind of science might require a new way of thinking
2763360	2767920	of doing or thinking about philosophical questions. I mean, not just in philosophy of
2767920	2773120	mathematics or philosophy of science, but in metaphysics and epistemology and all of these
2773120	2777920	areas. But for the moment, though, I'd like to stick with science because there are some really
2777920	2782880	big questions there and some big distinctions that I'd like to clear up. And the first is between
2783600	2790960	theory and object. And I mean, I suppose one might define physics as it has been done
2791520	2797280	so far as the study of matter and energy and the fundamental building blocks of the world.
2797360	2803600	But there's a distinction between the theories that a physicist develops and then the world that
2803600	2810800	they describe. But I hear when I hear you talk, I hear about the Ruliad as an object, like the
2810800	2817520	world or the universe, or a multiverse, maybe, but it also seems like it's our fundamental
2817520	2823680	theory of the world in a way too. So the question is, what the physicist, what the physicist is
2823680	2830720	doing here? Is the physicist developing theories that describe the Ruliad or is sampling and
2830720	2837440	understanding the Ruliad, sampling and understanding the theory itself? Or do these things break down?
2837440	2842560	It's sort of a question of what is science? What is natural science? And the way I see it is,
2842560	2848960	natural science is kind of a translation layer between kind of the underlying computation,
2848960	2855280	the underlying world as it is, and the stuff that we can sort of talk about and think about with
2855280	2862720	our minds. So in other words, what we've got kind of the things that are just happening out there,
2863280	2868560	and we've got our way of describing what's happening. And I think that the fundamental
2868560	2874080	role of natural science is to figure out of all the stuff that's happening out there, what can we
2874080	2880080	parse out that we can package in such a way that we can kind of have a narrative about it in our
2880080	2885040	minds? I mean, there is something that's just happening out there. But the question is, what is
2885040	2890800	it that we, you know, how do we talk to ourselves about what's happening out there? And we are only
2890800	2895920	sampling tiny pieces of what's happening out there. But I think to your question about sort of,
2895920	2902160	it's almost, I was surprised that I was able to say anything about this, but the why does the
2902160	2907840	universe exist question? You know, because there's, you know, you can say, well, I've got this theory,
2907840	2914320	but why is the theory actualized? In what sense, you know, what breathes the fire into the universe,
2914320	2920400	so to speak? What, you know, what is, and, you know, I suppose from a, and I don't know all the
2920400	2925520	philosophical history here, but, but, you know, I certainly know the quote from Spinoza about,
2925520	2931440	you know, the universe is the thoughts of God actualized, so to speak. And it's, it's kind of,
2931440	2940000	you know, it's, it's a, this question of what is, how does one think about sort of,
2941520	2950320	what is actualization in a situation where what we somehow, and I'm, this is, this real-time
2950320	2956560	philosophy is a bit, is a bit too hard, I think, but it's, I know when, you know,
2958000	2961760	my mother was a philosophy professor, which caused me to say that if there's one thing
2961760	2965360	I'll never do when I'm growing up, it's being a philosopher. But one of the things that,
2965360	2971440	one of the many things that I sort of would give a hard time to about some, about philosophy was that
2971440	2976880	the, you know, the Oxford philosophers would give a talk and they would read every word of this talk.
2976880	2981600	And it's like, that's very, you know, that's very wooden, you know, you can do better than that.
2982560	2987680	But actually when you have to really, you know, get all these distinctions correct,
2987680	2993440	it's actually pretty hard to do that in real time. So it's, it's, so I'm, I'm,
2994640	3000640	but this question about sort of, okay, so I think on this question about sort of why does the
3000640	3008080	universe exist? Why is anything actualized? I think that the way to think about that is
3009440	3014800	there isn't really a question of why the Ruliat exists any more than there's a question of why
3014800	3021760	2 plus 2 equals 4 exists, right? It's just an abstract thing. So now the real question is sort of
3023280	3029680	then we have the sort of a prior knowledge that we are perceiving this thing, we are here
3029680	3037040	perceiving this thing. It is in a sense less obvious that we should exist than that this
3037040	3043360	abstract thing should exist. But, but in a sense by the very fact that we're here doing the perceiving,
3044080	3051120	we know that if we want to describe something as existing, we, you know, we know that we're here,
3051120	3060000	so to speak. And so I think the kind of the, the why, why is there a, you know, I suppose it comes
3060000	3070560	down to asking why, you know, why is the universe, why is there a perception of something like the
3070560	3077120	universe out there that we have access to? And my, I think the answer would be that it is
3078080	3084320	the Ruliat is this inevitable thing. The given that you know that we're here as observers,
3084880	3090720	you know, having a perception of things, it is inevitable that the things of which we have can
3090720	3096640	have a perception are these are is this abstract object, because the abstract object doesn't,
3096640	3102320	you know, the abstract object is the only thing we have to argue, the only contingent fact,
3102560	3108800	and even this gets more complicated. The only contingent fact is that we are computational
3108800	3119200	and not, for example, hyper computational. That is the fact that we exist as a place in the Ruliat.
3119760	3125040	So the Ruliat is sort of this entangled limit of all possible computations,
3125760	3131760	computation, something that follows rules. But as we start to say, what precisely do we mean by that?
3132320	3137440	We might say follows rules like a Turing machine, or like a cellular autonomous or like a network
3137440	3143040	rewriting system, those are all equivalent. Those are all computations of the standard thing that
3143040	3148320	we refer to as computation. But if we're just thinking about it, we can say, well, let's take
3148320	3154720	things that are undoable in finite time by any computational system set up in this way. Let's
3154720	3161600	just say we have a magic box that can do those those hyper computations do computations do in
3161600	3167200	finite time, computations that would take an infinite time for any computational system of
3167200	3175440	the kind that we're describing. Let's say that we have a hyper computational system. Well,
3175440	3180000	then we could start building up a Ruliat from hyper computation as well. We can build up a
3180000	3185840	hyper Ruliat, we can build up an infinite collection of hyper Ruliat. So the question
3185840	3193280	that is again, not I think is a contingent fact about the world. Okay, there's going to be an
3193280	3198320	interesting footnote to this. But the initial observation would be the fact that we are in
3198320	3205280	the Ruliat and not in the hyper Ruliat is something that is no more derivable than the fact that we're
3205280	3210880	in this galaxy rather than some other galaxy. And it's just we happen to be here. That's the first
3211280	3216000	first level of I don't so much like that explanation. And as I said, I think, well,
3216000	3221840	we're about to about to come to an even more bizarre point, which is but but but so
3223040	3229520	and and well, we say, Well, what about let's just go observe the hyper Ruliat? Well, you can't do that
3229520	3237040	from inside the Ruliat is kind of an event horizon that prevents you ever having any kind of causal
3237040	3242400	connection to things in the hyper Ruliat. By the way, there's a whole hierarchy of these things.
3242400	3250800	Within our universe, there are things that don't have all of the kind of richness of our universe,
3251440	3258480	namely, black holes, you know, you know, I wrote a piece about about cats. So we'll have to talk
3258480	3264800	about that. Yeah, right. They, which is relevant to the Ruliat, but we'll, we'll, we'll get to that
3264800	3268160	perhaps. The in the case that the thing that
3270800	3275360	the thing is sort of interesting, perhaps, is we have our universe, which is sort of a
3275360	3283200	computational kind of thing. And then we have things like black holes. And one feature of sort
3283200	3288720	of the simplest kind of black holes is time stops. In other words, in our universe, we believe
3288720	3293200	time just keeps going, keeps going, keeps going. But in a typical black hole with a space like
3293200	3299200	singularity, there's a time just stops. In our models, it's pretty easy to see how that works.
3299200	3305760	There are these rewrite rules, and there's just no rules to apply. But the point is that what would
3305760	3309920	in our universe would be this thing where we say, well, you can have arbitrary long proofs,
3309920	3316240	you can have arbitrary long sort of experiences of the universe. And if you are stuck inside a
3316240	3322000	black hole, you don't have that. So similarly, from the point of view of the hyper Ruliat,
3322080	3329440	our whole Ruliat's worth of experience looks like a black hole. It looks like gosh, you can't,
3329440	3335040	it's not quite time is finite in the sense that well, time is time is infinitesimal relative to
3335040	3341120	the what can be achieved in all the time of our universe is infinitesimal compared to what can
3341120	3348320	be achieved in a moment of time in the hyper universe. And so that okay, so now one of the
3348320	3354080	things which is again one of these. So you say, well, we got the Ruliat, we got the hyper Ruliat,
3354080	3359600	why did we get stuck in the Ruliat? Why didn't we have a, you know, why aren't we in hyper Ruliat
3359600	3367040	numbers such and such? I'm pretty sure that there is a notion of Rulial Relativity, that basically,
3367040	3374720	once you are an observer that have certain level of computational capability, that it is your
3374720	3381600	experience of the world is necessarily the same. In other words, if you're an observer in any level
3381600	3390320	of the hyper Ruliat, you are your, you know, when you perceive things, you will, if you're in a
3390320	3396880	hyper Ruliat, then your perceptions are hyper relative to what they would be in our Ruliat.
3396880	3404880	But if you are, but that you match the level of Ruliat that you're in. And so I think, I mean,
3404880	3409920	we still need to work out the details of this, but I think that it's going to end up that it
3409920	3415520	doesn't matter, that you're, that kind of, that there is no, that that removes that piece of
3415520	3421040	contingency, so to speak. But I'm not sure, let's see, I forget how we got to this now, but
3421200	3431200	but the, I mean, we're talking about kind of the necessity of the, well, the existence of the
3431200	3436400	universe, why is it necessary that the universe should exist? And my claim is that these abstract
3436400	3448640	constructs necessarily exist. And that the, the once you, the question of whether, well, okay, so,
3449200	3453600	I think I managed to get a bit further than this, and I'm, I'm trying to remember what the,
3453600	3458480	what all the arguments were here. But this, this question of whether,
3460240	3465440	yeah, the issue is, within the Ruliat, why is there a thing that is like an observer?
3466800	3474080	Why should, why should there be anything that is like an observer like us? And I think that,
3474640	3480080	so, so one question is, what does an observer like us fundamentally do? And I think the answer is,
3480800	3487040	what observers do is they take the complexity of the world, and they try and stuff it into a finite
3487040	3493440	mind. Because, you know, there is all the stuff going on out there, but we don't perceive that
3493440	3499760	stuff. We perceive this tiny, you know, tiny trickle of information. I mean, we're, you know,
3499840	3504880	the photons falling on our eyes, there are zillions of them every second. But yet,
3504880	3510640	all we perceive is I'm looking at a face or something. In other words, we are equivalencing
3510640	3514400	and the same thing in a much more physical setting. Imagine we're trying to measure the
3514400	3519120	pressure of a gas, and we have a piston, we got some, you know, and all the gas molecules are
3519120	3523360	hitting the piston. And there's a zillion configurations of these gas molecules. But all
3523360	3527840	that matters in measuring the pressure of the gas is what the aggregate force on the piston is.
3528480	3534160	And so that, that measuring process is equivalencing a large number of states of the world.
3534800	3538960	And I think that's, that's the essence of a computationally bounded observer,
3539600	3546800	is that you have to equivalence lots of states of the world to stuff your experience of the world
3546800	3552800	into, you know, a finite mind, so to speak. And so then the question is, you know, you start
3552800	3559600	asking, well, you know, are there pieces of the Rulliard, are there pieces of what's possible
3559600	3567600	that we can interpret as kind of a thing that is equivalencing things and, and sort of reducing
3567600	3576560	them to something where we can, where, where we can interpret it in this way. And I think it's
3576640	3583040	one of the features, one of the sort of scientific facts is this phenomenon that within any
3583040	3589120	computationally irreducible system, there are necessarily an infinite number of lump of sort
3589120	3594480	of pockets of computational reducibility. So to unpack that a bit. So given that you have a set
3594480	3602320	of rules, and you say, I'm going to run these rules, you might say, if we know the rules for a system,
3602320	3607920	then we're done. We know how the system's going to behave. And that was what people sort of assumed
3607920	3614400	was true. But it isn't true. Because what happens is the working out of those rules involves a
3614400	3620160	certain amount of computation. And it can involve an irreducible amount of computation. So if you
3620160	3625200	say, I want to know what's going to happen a million years from now, it's like, sorry, the only way
3625200	3628960	you can work that out is to live through those million years and do all those computations.
3629600	3635360	That is not, you know, the conceit of mathematics in a sense, is you just solve the equation,
3635360	3640640	or you fill in the numbers in the formula and you're done. There is a quick way to work out what's
3640640	3645520	going to happen. But the difference, the fundamental difference between sort of the mathematical
3645520	3650800	paradigm for thinking about science, I think, and the computational one is in the computational one,
3650800	3656160	you're given a rule, and then you have to run it to find out its consequence. It's not,
3656880	3663520	you can just nail it and have something which is kind of finite mind narrative of this is the
3663520	3669680	mathematical result. So there's this phenomenon of computational irreducibility. It is, I think,
3670800	3678480	it is a really central phenomenon. I mean, if there's one thing that I think is sort of a
3678480	3683600	takeaway from lots of things that I've done, it's the idea of computational irreducibility,
3683600	3690400	because it's what leads to, you know, it has consequences all over the place. It has consequences
3690400	3697440	for, well, for things like free will, it has consequences for, you know, if we say, if there
3697440	3704640	wasn't computational irreducibility, then the passage of our lives and the passage of time
3705280	3709760	would not really mean anything. Because we'd always be able to say, you know, you lead your life,
3709760	3716800	you live out many decades or whatever, but the answer is 42, you know the end, you can just jump
3716800	3723840	to the end. The fact that we have to experience all of those intermediate steps is a consequence of
3723840	3728640	the phenomenon of computational irreducibility. It's also in a quite different domain, you know,
3728640	3733520	if you're thinking about, you know, AI, and you say, I'm going to put in these rules for AI
3733520	3738880	governments, and they're going to work perfectly. It's like, well, no, they're not, because there
3738960	3744400	will always be an unexpected thing that happens, because the working out of those rules will show
3744400	3750720	computational irreducibility. And it's computational irreducibility is a completely ubiquitous thing
3750720	3758480	among systems rules. But the thing then that's surprising, okay, so given computational irreducibility,
3758480	3764720	why is science possible? In other words, why is it possible to make statements about the world
3764720	3770720	that are useful narratives of finite minds? It, you know, you might say it's just hopeless,
3770720	3778960	we can't figure out anything. The thing that is then a sort of a fact about computational
3778960	3784000	irreducibility, it is inevitable that within a computational irreducible system, there'll be
3784000	3788640	an infinite number of pockets of reducibility of places where you can make a little prediction.
3789520	3796640	And if you, it's rather a fairly easy argument that if that wasn't the case, if it was sort of
3796640	3802720	uniform computational irreducibility, you could use that very fact to make predictions. And so,
3802720	3807920	you know, that that sort of diagonal argument gives you gives you this result. But then so that
3807920	3812000	means there are all these pockets of irreducibility. What are those? What are those? Well, those are
3812000	3816880	the places where those are what we live in. You know, the fact that our lives are somewhat our
3816880	3822480	universe is somewhat predictable is because we're looking at a slice of reducibility in all of this
3822480	3828320	computational irreducibility. That's throughout the Roulillade, we are sampling a piece of it,
3828320	3834640	observers like us sample a piece of it that represents a pocket of reducibility. And by the
3834640	3838560	way, there are a lot of other things that those sort of pockets of reducibility correspond to,
3838560	3843760	like, for example, I think technology, you know, scientific discoveries, technology,
3843760	3848560	these are all examples of pockets of reducibility. You know, the world's a complicated place,
3848560	3853920	but we can make a scientific statement. You know, the fact that science is possible is science is
3853920	3859680	possible because there are these pockets of reducibility. And that's essentially where,
3860240	3864800	you know, where the science lives. That's what the science is doing is it's identifying,
3864800	3869040	you know, these pockets of reducibility. By the way, that has another consequence, which is
3869040	3875120	science will never be finished. There are always more pockets of reducibility. That's not self
3875120	3880320	evident, I think. It could be the case that, you know, if it wasn't for computational irreducibility,
3880320	3885920	then we would say we found the rules of the universe were done. But that's not correct,
3885920	3891360	because of irreducibility. But it's still got to be the case, even given the irreducibility,
3891360	3896160	that we can say things, and there'll be an infinite sequence of things we can say. I mean,
3896160	3900240	it's the same thing with technology. There's a question of how will, will there be a moment
3900240	3906240	when every invention has been made? And the answer is no, because inventions are these places where
3906240	3911120	you're getting sort of your, your making use of some pocket of reducibility. I mean, that the
3911120	3917360	footnote to that is, one thing that could happen is every invention that we humans care about has
3917360	3924080	been made. I don't think that happens because I think that the domain that we care about gradually
3924080	3930160	expands. And I think that's, you know, one thing I, you know, a sort of a little bit of a whimsical
3930160	3936880	way to talk about it. But, you know, we, the progress of science and sort of the arch of
3936880	3941680	intellectual history is a story of kind of, you know, additional paradigms, additional ways to
3941680	3946720	measure things about the world and so on. And the question is, you know, if we look at our,
3947680	3955040	our sort of presence in the Rulliard as a species or something, one aspect of our expansion is we
3955040	3959040	send out spacecraft when they go a certain number of, you know, astronomical units away from us.
3960400	3967440	That's exploring physical space. The growth of paradigms, I think, is a growth in Rullial space
3967440	3974720	that we're gradually sort of putting, there is more, there are more domains of that there's
3974880	3982560	sort of more descriptions of the universe that we can put in our bag of things that we can stuff
3982560	3990480	into our minds. So in other words, we're, as we invent a new paradigm, we are able to sample
3990480	3995280	where we're, we're sort of exploring more parts of the Rullia, we're exploring more different
3995280	4001120	kinds of rules that we can use to sort of talk about the universe and so on. So that's, that's
4001680	4008640	so it's kind of a sort of the expansion of, you know, in, in our, we can, we can make a choice
4008640	4015600	that you can set up more spacecraft, we can do more theoretical science and, you know, or some
4015600	4020320	more experimental science and find, you know, more different kinds of measurements that we can make,
4020320	4027600	you know, we start some. So these are, we can move farther or get smaller. Yes. Yes. Well, right,
4027600	4032160	I mean, that's another issue. It's another very interesting thing I think about us as
4032160	4038160	sort of a contingent fact about us as observers, we're actually pretty big. That is, if we're,
4038160	4043840	the universe is, you know, 10 to the 26 meters across in physical space, and we're give or take
4043840	4050800	a meter tall, you know, we kind of think the elementary length, the sort of the, the, an effect,
4050800	4055680	the effective distance between atoms of space or something might be 10 to the minus 100 meters.
4056240	4060720	So relative to that, where maybe, I don't know, that estimate is right,
4060720	4066480	where 100 orders of magnitude bigger than we, than the smallest and 26 orders of magnitude smaller
4066480	4070960	than the biggest, so to speak. So we're pretty big. And, and there's sort of a question of,
4071920	4078000	what's that? Good for the ego. Yeah, right. Well, okay, we'll get to, don't get too confident there,
4078000	4085520	because I think we're big in physical space in, in the Rulliard in rural space, we're pretty damn
4085520	4091760	small. In other words, you know, so one, one sort of way of, of probing that question, really that
4091760	4098720	the question of how big are we in rural space is the question of, of sort of, how do, what is the
4098720	4104640	diversity of, of what different kinds of minds can perceive? You know, if we have some point in,
4104640	4110720	in the Rulliard, then, then with minds of the kind we have, and each of us has a different
4110720	4116400	mind, so to speak, where all these little points in rural space, humans with similar kinds of,
4116400	4122720	you know, backgrounds or whatever might be quite close in rural space, your, your cat there is a
4122720	4129920	little bit further away in rural space. Although, you know, we can recognize, you know, certain
4129920	4135360	features, the emotional, you know, characteristics of the cat are sort of recognizable to us, even
4135360	4140960	though cat philosophy is probably not something that, you know, if there is a cat philosophy,
4140960	4146000	we don't, you know, we don't know what it is. And I think it's very tuna-centric.
4148000	4154960	Yeah, right. That's, that's, you know, I do think that the modern times of machine learning,
4154960	4160480	one of the things that, you know, the talk to the animals thing should be a thing. The main block
4161120	4168240	is this question of sort of the, the distance in rural space, the kinds of things that, you know,
4168240	4174880	that one might talk about may be so bizarrely different, that they're not things where, you
4174880	4179520	know, it's a, again, it's like science, it's like this translation layer between, you know,
4179520	4185280	science is a translation between the natural world and what goes in our brains. And this is
4185280	4191360	sort of a level of a science-like thing that is, you know, the translation from what's going on in
4191360	4201680	the animal brain to what's going on in ours. But I think, let's see, we were, yeah, right. So, I mean,
4201680	4208320	in, you know, this question of how big is the space of possible alien minds? What is the diversity
4208320	4213760	of possible ways to look at the universe? And I did a little experiment. It's a very, very,
4214400	4223360	I would say, sort of very basic approach to that question, which is, think about an AI and you're
4223360	4232160	thinking about kind of a generative AI system. And, you know, the typical image generation AI
4232160	4240160	system has been trained on billions of human produced images. And then it's generating things
4240160	4246720	that are like those human produced images. And so you can start asking, well, that's a mind that's
4246720	4251600	aligned with a human mind, because it's trained from human produced images. But you can like take
4251600	4257440	that mind and just start changing the weights and the neural network. And then you have something
4257440	4264240	which is not quite like, you know, it's kind of, it started from a human mind, but now it's,
4264240	4269840	it's sort of modified relative to, to that human mind. And you can start asking, well, what are the
4270640	4275120	images that you produce in that, in that case? There's even a simple thing you can do. You can
4275120	4284480	just say every, every image that is generatable is, there's this kind of latent space, there's this
4284480	4293680	kind of sort of numerically defined, coordinated space of possible images, so to speak. And you
4293760	4300560	can just say, well, there's a particular region of that space that corresponds to a picture of a cat.
4301440	4308160	And as we change our coordinates in that space, we'll make other kinds of pictures. And so then
4308160	4315040	the question is, there are some pockets of that space that correspond to human concepts, cats, dogs,
4315760	4321520	elephants, whatever, right? And the question would be, if you look at that whole space,
4322160	4327840	what fraction of the space is covered by those human concepts? So for example, one of the things
4327840	4333040	that, you know, I made some pictures of is cat island, the, you know, the thing which is
4333760	4339040	near the concept of a cat. As you go further away, you stop, you see pictures that don't really look
4339040	4344560	like cats anymore. And pretty soon they, they degrade into things that are not really recognizable
4344560	4350560	by us humans as pictures of anything that we know about. So even in the simplest case,
4351120	4357520	the region of, in a sense, rural space, that there's a small tiny slice of a real space,
4357520	4363280	but the region that corresponds to concepts that we are familiar with is about one part in 10 to
4363280	4370960	the 600. So in other words, the stuff, the, the, the part of rural space that we are familiar with,
4370960	4376720	even in this very simple slicing of rural space is an absolutely infinitesimal fraction.
4377360	4381760	What's, what else is out? You know, I was referring to it as inter concept space.
4382400	4387920	There is, you know, dotted around the space are concepts that we humans have decided to
4387920	4395840	invent so far in our, in our sort of civilizational history. But in between those concepts, it's
4395840	4402960	like interstellar space. There's, there's things that we haven't explored yet. And those are huge
4402960	4409440	compared to the ones that we already explored. So in some sense, we are that that's a, and by,
4409440	4414800	but by the way, I mean, what we, what we can imagine is that over the course of time, we will
4414800	4422720	gradually bring into our kind of domain of knowledge more and more things that are sort of out there
4422720	4428640	in this, in the space. So, so an example would be, you know, go back 50 years, we're making these
4428640	4434000	pictures, some things that show up in these pictures are nested fractal patterns. If you
4434000	4437840	go back 50 years, and you saw those things, you're just kind of like just shrugging your
4437840	4441600	shoulders. I don't know what that is. It's just something I don't really know about or care about.
4442320	4446080	Now that we know about fractals and nested patterns, we immediately say, oh, that's a
4446080	4454080	fractal pattern. And no doubt there are many other things out there in that space, where in time,
4454080	4458400	for whatever reason, we may start caring about these things, we may give them names
4458400	4465200	in our human languages and so on. And, and then that may be part of our sort of domain of things
4465200	4470880	we think about. I mean, it gives one, there's a sort of a funny twist, which I don't know that I
4470880	4476400	fully understand yet, which is, you know, you say, well, what's the future of history? Well, it's,
4476400	4481600	it's kind of like we explore interstellar space and physical space and so on. And then we explore
4481600	4487520	the Rulliad. We go on exploring more and more of the Rulliad. And kind of the story of intellectual
4487520	4492400	history could be the story of sort of just expanding, expanding, expanding the Rulliad space.
4492400	4496880	They say, well, then eventually we get to this wonderful situation where we've expanded throughout
4496880	4502480	Rulliad space, we're done, we've discovered everything. The problem is, I think in that case,
4503760	4509760	by the time we've expanded our mind to encompass everything, our mind is no longer coherent.
4509760	4517760	We no longer coherently exist. That is, I think that the, the, you know, coherent existence
4518320	4526720	requires sort of, in some sense, smallness. If you, if you are everything, then you're not,
4526720	4534160	there's no coherent you to the whole story. There has to be a, you know, the fact that we,
4534880	4541280	that we, we have coherent minds that believe that we have definite experiences and things
4541280	4547600	like that. I think as a consequence of the fact that our minds are not, you know, they're limited,
4547600	4553040	so to speak. If it wasn't for that, we wouldn't, you know, we wouldn't have this kind of coherent
4553040	4558640	sense of being us, so to speak. And so I think it's kind of a, a be careful what you wish for
4558640	4563360	situation, but it's like, yes, we, you know, we just succeeded. We expanded throughout Rulliad space.
4564560	4571200	The problem is now we don't coherently exist. And, you know, I think that's some,
4572240	4576640	I think that has all sorts of resonance with, with things people talk about in many kind of
4576640	4582240	Eastern traditions and philosophy and so on, which are, you know, I find it interesting how little
4582240	4588000	I understand about those things. Because in a sense, that's a story of, of one's kind of limitation
4588000	4593040	in Rulliad space. And that, you know, I've grown up in sort of a Western thought tradition, so to
4593040	4598480	speak. And it's really difficult for me to understand, you know, even if there is some there, there,
4599200	4604800	it's, you know, I, with my way of thinking about things, it's like I try and, I try and approach
4604800	4609360	it with my way of thinking about things and it just doesn't quite fit. I mean, this particular
4609360	4614720	point is perhaps the point of contact between these kinds of different, different ways of
4614720	4622720	thinking about things. Well, these notions of exploring the Rulliad, of sampling the Rulliad
4622720	4629600	of the translation layer. I mean, it all just raises, it raises so many more classical questions and
4629600	4637600	epistemology and metaphysics and the philosophy of science. And you said a while ago now that
4637600	4646000	natural science is what we can parse about what's happening out there. And you also said,
4646960	4654480	with regard to the Rulliad, I mean, it's this necessary abstract object. And that we have
4654480	4662720	this perception of it. But where I'm getting at is that physics is generally considered to
4663760	4670000	concern, I mean, quite naturally, the physical world, though, I mean, physical or material,
4670080	4675760	these terms, they get a bit murky when one starts talking about things like fields and
4675760	4683040	wave functions and so on. But even though I mean, physical objects like the computers we're using
4683040	4690160	right now, they do carry out calculations and so on. But computation itself is an abstract
4690160	4697200	process. And the Rulliad itself is to use reference that quote again, the entangled limit
4697200	4701920	of everything that is computationally possible. So it's like a, it's a collection of equivalence
4701920	4709920	classes or something of that. And so I wonder then, whether ultimately you view the universe as a
4709920	4715600	physical object or an abstract object, or these categories just somehow don't make sense anymore
4715600	4720000	at this level of discussion, or whether we're physical, I think they don't make sense. Because
4720000	4728720	I think that, you know, all, yeah, I mean, all, all I, all I know is what I perceive. And, you
4728720	4739040	know, it's not to have the, you know, you might say, that's a very, and I know there are traditions
4739040	4745040	and philosophy where, where one sort of gets oneself tangled up by thinking that way, and saying
4745040	4750720	there's no, there's no there outside, so to speak. It's a little different in what I'm talking about,
4750720	4757840	because there is that there is something there, it's the Rulliad. But it's not this question of
4757840	4770640	whether there is a, you know, is there a, is there a thing that makes in what sense is, you
4770640	4778480	know, a solid object more real than some concept of mathematics? I mean, that's, that's kind of the,
4779200	4787920	you know, they, that I suppose, yeah, I mean, there's this question about what's out there
4787920	4794000	in physical reality. You know, one of the things we've got to realize is that as we have progressed
4794000	4799760	in the history of physics, we've had different kinds of measuring devices. There are things which
4799760	4804800	where they were presumably features of the universe all along, but we never knew they were there.
4805360	4811040	And I think that's kind of a, you know, that's the experience of, of saying, you know, so in
4811040	4818720	what sense is it even worth talking about a thing about the universe that we are completely unable
4818720	4825600	to perceive? Is that a, you know, you might still say, well, it's there, but we can't perceive it.
4826160	4829760	And so it's not something that's going to be part of the, the canon of our physics.
4830400	4836240	You know, it could be that there are, well, you know, gravitational waves, okay, that's a thing
4836240	4842720	that wasn't, you know, that, that was a long expected thing. But there could be, you know,
4842720	4851360	all kinds of, of strange phenomena, you know, that I could imagine, well, for example, in our
4851360	4856720	models of physics, there are dimension fluctuations. Our universe, we think of it as three dimensional,
4856720	4860960	but actually in our models of physics, it isn't exactly three dimensional, it has little dimension
4860960	4867760	fluctuations. And that's something that we are not currently, we don't have a good, I don't know
4867760	4873520	how we measure those, possibly they're related to gravity, possibly they're related to dark matter.
4874160	4881200	But, you know, once we get to the point where we suddenly realize, oh gosh, we can use this method
4881280	4888880	to take these dimension fluctuations and render them in a way that sort of connects to our minds,
4889840	4893360	then we've got a whole different set of things that we can talk about in terms of physics,
4893360	4901040	and a whole different set of things that we can kind of say are, you know, to discuss as, as physical
4901040	4908320	constructs. But I think it's a question of what, what is it that we can successfully perceive?
4908960	4914080	Those are the things about which we're going to have a, have a physics discussion. If we can't,
4914080	4924480	if we're not perceiving it, we don't, you know, we don't discuss what we don't perceive. And there
4924480	4929920	might be, and you say, well, there might be things where there's a little, you know, there are a lot
4929920	4934400	of things which in the history of physics, for example, things about quantum mechanics, where we
4934400	4940160	just, physics went along for years without ever caring about any of that stuff, until there started
4940160	4946880	the experiments which rubbed our noses in those phenomena, and which came about, I think, because
4946880	4952240	of electronic amplifiers and things like that got invented, and that allowed us to amplify small
4952240	4957760	signals and we could start to detect things we haven't been able to detect before. But I mean,
4957760	4970560	you know, this, this question of, well, I mean, from a, it's sort of interesting as one, as one
4970560	4975840	starts to kind of, you know, one of the things that's always challenging is to live the paradigms
4975840	4982880	one invents. And, you know, I've, this is a thing which is, honestly, I think it's one of the more
4982880	4988800	challenging things. It's like, you know, as you have different generations of intellectual thinkers,
4989360	4995840	it's, you know, it's usually a couple generations later, the people kind of can really sort of,
4995840	5002640	you know, the paradigm is so obvious to them that you can sort of build on it. And I have to say that
5002640	5010720	the, the kind of the perception of, of sort of this, this, this idea of the Ruiad and the idea that
5011200	5015920	all that is real is our perception of, of, you know, our particular perception of it and so on,
5016480	5021840	the, I'm not sure that I've totally internalized that. I mean, just to talk a little bit about
5021840	5026960	personal history and the internalization of paradigms, it's, it is interesting to me that,
5027520	5034480	you know, in my life, at least many kinds of ideas, they take a couple of decades at least
5035120	5042320	for one to internalize it. That is, you see a phenomenon, you know, the primary problem of
5042320	5047280	doing things like experimental science and Ruleology, just studying possible rules in the
5047280	5052960	computational universe is a kind of experimental science. The challenge of experimental science
5052960	5060720	is to discover things you didn't expect. Because too often, your, your paradigm for thinking about
5060720	5067680	things is, is one which makes you blind things that you don't expect. And in fact, this phenomenon
5067680	5074000	of complicated behavior from simple rules, people had observed that for at least 50 years, if not
5074000	5080720	longer, before the things that I did, but they just ignored it. They said, oh, we're studying early
5080720	5086720	neural nets and they sometimes they have noise and the noise is a nuisance. And we want to study,
5086720	5092560	you know, how do they behave like, like brains that make decisions or something. But, and it's
5092560	5097280	even the case, you know, when I was first studying these simple rules and their, and their consequence
5097280	5104880	is a number of very good mathematicians got involved in doing that. And they said, this is,
5104880	5108560	you know, we're going to be able to solve this, these are simple rules, we're going to be able to
5108560	5113760	crack this with mathematics. After a couple of years, they were like, no, we can't say anything,
5113760	5121360	we give up. Okay. And I suppose that the thing that, in a sense, I realized many years after the
5121360	5127200	fact is my main intellectual achievement at that moment was to realize the fact that one was giving
5127200	5133360	up was itself very interesting. I mean, the fact that there was a, you know, a paradigm that was
5133360	5138880	all about computational irritability and all these kinds of things that was orthogonal to the
5138880	5144480	mathematical paradigm, in some sense, or different from mathematical paradigm, that was in itself
5144480	5149280	very interesting. But it took, you know, I would say that a lot of these kind of,
5151680	5158480	you know, a lot of these ideas, they take a surprisingly long time for one to kind of internalize,
5158480	5164880	so to speak. I mean, in, and it's kind of the role in some sense of scientific history is to go back
5164880	5169440	and look, you know, because there are lots of things I can see from my own history where, you know,
5169440	5176800	for example, the fact that building this first computational language of mine was important
5176800	5182800	in the realization that you could build the physics from nothing, so to speak. It took me
5182800	5187360	several decades after that had happened before I realized that kind of intellectual connection.
5187920	5195680	And, but I think, you know, this question of, of what does it, if one now is thinking about the
5195680	5202960	world in terms of the Rulliard and perceptions of the Rulliard and so on, how does that make one
5202960	5208560	feel about one's experience of the world? And, you know, it's, it feels,
5211200	5215680	and I, you know, I'm at the early stages of understanding that. I mean, I think it kind of,
5217440	5222560	you know, I think it's sometimes easier to see the scientific consequences. I mean, there are,
5222560	5231120	there are broader consequences of things. I mean, like, for example, a, you know, if you look at
5231120	5240160	sort of a big arc of scientific history, there are, you know, one very dramatic moment inside
5240160	5246160	of history was sort of the whole Copernican Revolution story, which one can interpret as being,
5246240	5251520	you know, it's obvious, you know, before that time, it's like, you know, we're on the earth,
5251520	5256720	the earth is still, you know, is stationary, and we're looking at all these things moving
5256720	5260640	around the sky, and it's obvious that the earth is stationary. You know, how could it not be,
5260640	5266000	you know, that is a matter of our common experience. And then, you know, the surprise is,
5266000	5271440	you can make up a bunch of math that shows that the earth isn't stationary, so to speak.
5271920	5277760	And, you know, it's better to think about it as going around the sun. And then it's like, okay,
5278320	5284640	really, you've got to sort of switch off your common sense and say, the math is going to solve
5284640	5290880	the problem. It's going to be a, you know, it's a different way of getting access to what's going
5290880	5297680	on in the world. And I think that, and finally, after a few centuries, people got used to the idea
5297680	5303120	of so we can calculate stuff. And then people got to this belief that, you know,
5303120	5307680	then we can calculate everything, you know, we just, we run science a bit longer, and we can
5307680	5312080	figure out, you know, what's going to happen in this epidemic, or what's this or that, or the other,
5312720	5318800	you know, we can figure out everything just from, quote, science, science interpreted as
5318800	5324000	this kind of jump ahead, kind of, we can make a formula for what's going to happen.
5324480	5332560	I think the thing that, in a sense, if there is a broader significance to figuring out things
5332560	5338880	about fundamental physics, it's that, you know, in this picture, things are computational all the
5338880	5345600	way down. And so just as one is forced by sort of the whole Copernican story to say, there's a
5345600	5350080	certain amount that we just have to figure out with math, and we can't figure out from common
5350080	5355760	sense. So one is forced by the idea that everything is computational all the way down to say,
5355760	5360560	so the phenomena that happen in computation are ones that we have to confront. We can't say
5361200	5365120	everything we do, you know, yes, there is computational irreducibility in principle,
5365120	5369920	but it's not going to be important for for the things that, you know, for, but it's something
5369920	5375040	that's just out there, and not another thing that that will be relevant to what we're dealing with.
5375680	5382640	So, you know, I think that's some, yeah, but I mean, you're, you're asking the sort of question
5382640	5390720	about how does one feel about whether, whether sort of there's a, there's a, there's a thing
5390720	5398960	out there, and what is that thing? And one, you know, and I, I think this is more a question
5398960	5404080	of humanly coming to terms with what is essentially an intellectual structure,
5404080	5409520	than it is a question of, I mean, I think the intellectual structure is, is I like to think
5409520	5415280	reasonably clear at this point. Now, the question is, how does one come to terms with that intellectual
5415280	5420160	structure? It's just like saying, you know, at the Copernican time, and, you know, it's like,
5420160	5425360	there's an intellectual structure that was, you know, now, now we have to come to terms with,
5425360	5432320	you just calculate it with math, which is totally disorienting. If you're starting from the,
5432320	5435280	look, it's obvious that the earth is standing still, so to speak.
5436720	5444000	Well, talking about living with one's paradigms, another paradigm that you're very familiar with,
5444000	5449680	and that is notoriously difficult to live with is quantum mechanics. And I mean, it's, it's one
5449680	5455520	thing to accept that quantum field theory is so successful. And it's another thing to accept
5455520	5460960	or really live, I suppose, concepts like entanglement, just to take a common example. And
5461680	5467120	okay, there are so many fascinating ways in which the Ruliad connects to or derives more
5467120	5470960	explicitly interesting physics, like that of general relativity and black holes, like you
5470960	5476720	mentioned a little bit earlier, but to focus on one for a moment. I'm curious about how living
5476720	5482000	with these two paradigms, the Ruliad and quantum mechanics has been for you in that.
5482320	5491600	Does it, I'm wondering if accepting the Ruliad forces a specific interpretation of quantum
5491600	5495760	mechanics on you? Because as I take it, the Ruliad is deterministic.
5496400	5505600	Yes. So I mean, okay, you know, they, my old friend Dick Feynman was used to say
5505600	5509520	after spending his life studying quantum mechanics, one of his favorite quotes was,
5509600	5516720	nobody understands quantum mechanics. And, you know, I think I am inching towards the point
5516720	5522080	where I can say I actually understand quantum mechanics. I don't think I'm fully there yet,
5522080	5529280	but I'm, I'm, you know, at least inching towards it. And I think the, the sort of key observation
5530000	5536400	is this point about the many parts of history, and the fact that we, in our experience,
5536400	5541200	span those parts of history, span multiple parts of history, just like we don't cover the,
5541200	5548000	we don't fill the whole universe. We don't span all possible parts of history, but we span a,
5548000	5554960	a chunk of parts of history. And that's in a sense, when we say there's so, so, okay, so then
5556960	5563360	there's the, there's the question, okay, so that one of the issues is, why do we think
5563360	5570720	that definite things happen? If there are many parts of history, why, why aren't we just living
5570720	5576480	in a world where many different things are happening? And inside a quantum computer, I think
5576480	5580640	that is what's happening. That's what, that's what a quantum computer, you know, inside the mind of a
5580640	5586160	quantum computer, it has many different things happening. The challenge with a quantum computer
5586160	5590480	and the challenge of what happens with quantum mechanics is somehow you have to take those
5590480	5597040	many parts of history and somehow aggregate them to something which is compatible with observers
5597040	5603040	like us, who believe that definite things happen. And so what is, it's like a measuring device.
5603040	5608400	It's like the, you know, the molecules hitting the piston. They, all those molecules are doing
5608400	5613440	different things, but the piston has one uniform kind of thing that it's doing. I think, in the
5613440	5620080	case of most kinds of quantum measurements, that it's more like a weighing balance. That is,
5620080	5624800	it's, you know, in the case of the piston, it's just aggregating real numbers and it's eventually,
5624800	5630240	you know, this is the average pressure type thing in a slightly different, but very similar kind of
5630240	5634880	measuring device is a weighing balance, where there are many different ways you can book grains of
5634880	5640800	sand on the two sides of the balance. But in the end, it will go to sunk one direction or the other.
5640800	5645680	And I think that's similar to what's happening in the measuring devices that are used for measuring
5645680	5650960	things like qubits and so on, where there's sort of this binary decision about, was the spin-off
5650960	5664160	or down or whatever else. Now, you know, in, if you then ask, so what, you know, when you're
5664160	5673040	thinking about sort of the rules of quantum mechanics, and you're asking what, you know,
5673040	5679680	I think the underlying rules of quantum mechanics rather easily map on to this sort of underlying
5679680	5684320	dynamics of these multi-way systems and many parts of history and so on, that stuff is pretty
5684320	5690800	directly the path integral. The issue is, can we explain why it's a discretized version of that,
5690800	5696240	which is quite mathematically interesting, blah, blah, blah. But in the end, it's sort of unsurprising,
5696240	5702320	because it's kind of just like the actualization in some sense of their mechanization of things
5702320	5707840	like the path integral. But then in traditional quantum mechanics, it's been kind of a hundred-year
5707840	5712880	wimp out, because it's been, it's basically, it's just like, and then there is this idea of measurement,
5713520	5720480	and we go from the quantum amplitudes to the measured results, and then something definite
5720480	5726800	happened. And we haven't had to describe, you know, the formalism of quantum mechanics as
5726800	5731360	mathematically tiptoed around this question of how does the measurement actually happen.
5732080	5738320	And in our models, there's much better chance to say, let's unpack what's inside the observer.
5738320	5742400	What is the observer doing? The observer is taking all these different things that can happen,
5742400	5746720	all these different threads of history, and they're equivalencing many different configurations,
5746720	5752240	and they're saying, so the spin was either up or it was down. And now we get to start unpacking
5752240	5756960	that and saying, well, what were the actual processes that caused that equivalencing to
5756960	5762480	happen? Just like in the case of the piston with the molecules and so on, what were the processes?
5762480	5767520	Well, every molecule that hits the piston causes the piston to deform a little bit. But, you know,
5767520	5773600	there are effectively sound waves in the piston that are exchanging momentum between the different
5773600	5780400	places where it gets hit. And it's a rigid thing. And so pretty quickly, it dissipates kind of the
5780400	5784400	little deformations that come from the individual molecules, and then you have a sort of collective
5784400	5789600	motion that occurs. And so similarly, and I haven't done this, and I've been wanting to do this,
5789600	5795200	is to really go through the sort of the details of how different quantum measurements are made
5795200	5800880	mechanically, you know, in the lab, what you actually do. And, you know, I've gone through
5800880	5805120	in qualitative terms, and I think you can kind of trace that it's a bunch of equivalences that
5805120	5810240	are being done. But then the question is, well, what can you say when you unpack this process of
5810240	5815360	measurement? What can you then say about quantum mechanics? What additional things can you say?
5815360	5820800	For example, you know, will quantum computers work? Or is it the case that what you gain in having
5820800	5826240	these many parts of history and many sort of parallel threads of computation, you'll lose
5826240	5831120	by, but then you have to knit all these pieces together. And that takes a lot of effort. And I
5831120	5837600	think that's an example of where you get to kind of make a finer sort of a finer statement about
5837600	5842160	quantum mechanics. Now, you could ask, you know, do we understand why the born rule of quantum
5842160	5847520	mechanics works? Not completely. We have arguments about it. We have arguments for why it should
5847520	5853440	work. Have we dotted the i's and crossed the t's not yet? I am confident that that's going to work
5853440	5859840	out. But we don't, you know, we, it's just, you know, this is one of the challenges. You have a
5859840	5865280	very foundational theory. And you're trying to get to the point where you can say, go do this
5865360	5869520	experiment. I mean, there are lots of people who've said to us, you know, we have this giant
5869520	5875040	telescope. What should we look for? You know, what, what, what actual experiment should we do to look
5875040	5880880	for, let's say, dimension fluctuations in the, in the, in the universe as it is, or, or look for
5881920	5888400	some other kinds of phenomena that our models predict. Problem is that actually going in and
5888400	5894880	nailing down kind of, you know, what the details of what the telescope should see are is a whole
5894880	5901040	bunch of work. And it's a big stack of kind of mathematical physics, and other things that
5901040	5905360	you need to go through. And computational irreducibility is not your friend, as far as the
5905360	5911760	stuff is concerned. And, you know, that is, we're slowly getting there. We now have nice
5911760	5916560	simulations of black hole mergers. We're starting to have simulations of quantum black holes and so
5916560	5920800	on. But it's a, you know, it's a, it's a whole bunch of work. And lots of people are getting
5920800	5928720	involved in that, which is nice. But, you know, when it comes to, so, you know, let's reproduce all,
5928720	5936480	okay, so I can say, in terms of, okay, so I mean, I think the fundamental point about
5936480	5943760	quote, understanding quantum mechanics is this idea about broad shield space, this idea that
5943760	5949920	quantum mechanics is, well, so for example, the fundamental law of quantum mechanics,
5949920	5954400	you could say it in different ways, but a nice way is in terms of the Feynman path integral.
5954400	5961760	And the path integral says that the ample sheet you get out is this, you know, you integrate
5961760	5970560	over all possible paths, and you take each path is weighted with e to the i times this quantity,
5970560	5976800	the action divided by h bar plants constant over 2i. So it's, it's a, it's a phase and e to the i
5976800	5982160	something or other. And the something or other is this action object, which is essentially an energy
5982160	5990320	density. And so the thing that's really cool is what, what what it's saying is the phase of the
5990320	5998560	quantum amplitude is determined by this energy density like thing. And the, well, okay, so in,
5998560	6006000	in physical space, the thing we know is that the paths particles take in physical space
6006640	6011520	are deflected by the presence of gravity, gravity, the source of gravity is energy,
6011520	6017760	energy momentum, mass energy momentum, whatever the whole same thing. The, so in other words,
6018400	6027360	a path taken in physical space is that path is determined by the presence of energy momentum.
6027440	6034800	It's, it's deflected by gravity. And so now we go to the same thing in Brown-Shield space in this
6034800	6040560	multiway graph and we're looking at and what turns out to be the case is that the paths in
6040560	6047360	Brown-Shield space basically are also deflected by the presence of energy. Energy in our models
6047360	6052560	is essentially the density of updates in this network. So paths in Brown-Shield space are
6052560	6059120	deflected by the presence of energy. And then I'm sort of skipping lots of pieces here, but, but,
6059120	6066160	but basically the, the current, our current belief is that position in physical space,
6066160	6071360	we understand what that is, that's kind of our common experience of position in physical space.
6071360	6078640	Position in Brown-Shield space, we're pretty sure corresponds to quantum phase. So saying that
6078720	6083600	the presence of energy momentum deflects paths in Brown-Shield space and so on is basically saying
6083600	6089600	the presence of energy momentum changes quantum phases, which is essentially what the path integral
6089600	6097280	is saying. And so the, the, the belief is that what in physical space is the Einstein equations
6097280	6104800	for space time and gravity and so on in Brown-Shield space, it's the exact same sort of underlying
6104800	6113360	process, but now it's the Feynman path integral instead. So this is, I mean, I mean, as a, from a
6113360	6120000	pure sort of elegance in physics point of view, this is quite spectacular because it means, you
6120000	6124960	know, general relativity and quantum mechanics, people have wondered how do they fit together? Well,
6124960	6129280	the answer is they're the same theory, that they're the same theory played out in a slightly
6129280	6133760	different space. And by the way, there are already echoes of that in what's been done in
6133760	6139600	mathematical physics, the holography principles and the ADS CFT correspondence and so on between
6139600	6145120	sort of things in general, so do things in Brown-Shield theory. I think those are, those are kind
6145120	6151680	of echoes of the exact same phenomenon that there is that in some sense, these two theories are
6151680	6156880	really the same theory. And for us, there's this thing called the multiway causal graph,
6156880	6163120	which is the kind of the biggest, the big graph where one projection of it is physical space,
6163120	6169520	another projection of Brown-Shield space. So in a sense, this graph encodes both quantum mechanics
6169520	6175040	and general relativity, and you're projecting it in different ways to, to get sort of the experience
6175040	6179920	of different things. So that's, I mean, that's a, but let me give you one more, one more kind of
6179920	6184640	picture of sort of how quantum mechanics tries to work. So one of the things that's
6184640	6189920	always confusing in quantum mechanics is things like destructive interference. So, you know,
6189920	6193920	you have two slits, you have, you know, the photon can go through one slit or it can go
6193920	6198400	through the other slit, but you say, well, it can go through either one or the other.
6198400	6203920	So, you know, by the time you're looking in the center of the, the screen behind these things,
6203920	6207120	it's, you know, there's got to be something there because after all, it could have gone through
6207120	6210800	once that it could have gone through the other slit, but how can you end up with nothing there?
6210800	6215360	How can you end up with destructive interference of the probability of that, that a, that a,
6215360	6222400	that a photon gets there? Okay. So here's what I think happens. And I think it's bizarrely similar
6222400	6227200	to a phenomenon in mathematics, actually. Let me, let me explain, let me actually explain
6227200	6233680	the phenomenon in mathematics first. Sure. So in, you know, my picture of mathematics is
6233680	6238240	the mathematician is, has a bag and they're collecting theorems that they think are true
6238240	6244400	and putting them in this bag. The, the, the mathematician with a finite mind only can have
6244400	6250720	a finite bag of theorems that they kind of coherently think are true. But now imagine that
6250720	6257360	you put a false theorem in there. Well, now in sort of from the middle ages, people have said,
6257360	6262000	you know, material implication, if you have a false premise, you can derive everything.
6262560	6268240	This is this kind of idea of, you know, principle of explosion or whatever, that once you, you know,
6268800	6274240	if you were seeing a false hood, then the, you know, then you can derive any possible,
6274240	6278160	any possible result. So what happens to the mathematician when they put a false theorem
6278160	6282480	in their bag? The answer is that false theorem entails all possible theorems.
6283040	6289120	So that bag explodes. And so they, the, the, you know, so that their mind explodes in some sense,
6289120	6295680	they can't, they can't maintain all these things together. So, so that's kind of the, that's sort
6295680	6302960	of, so now let's look at the quantum mechanics case. So now what I think happens is that the two
6302960	6308080	photons, they go to slightly different places in physical space, but in Braunschild space,
6308720	6314160	these two photons that both could end up at the center of the screen are at kind of opposite ends
6314160	6322160	of Braunschild space. And so the, the observer who is bounded in Braunschild space is trying very
6322160	6327600	hard to say, well, what happened? You know, I could imagine both photons were there, but to
6327600	6332560	imagine that I would have to expand my mind in Braunschild space. In fact, I would probably
6332560	6339840	have to expand it in some idealized way, infinitely. And so just like the mathematician can't put that
6339840	6347200	false hood into their bag, so similarly, the observer of these two photons can't conclude
6347200	6352560	that they just can't make consistent the picture that the photon went through either one thing or
6352560	6357360	the other. And so they have to say, didn't, you know, the photon just disappeared, so to speak.
6357360	6361920	That's, that's my, but you know, there are, there are lots of, you know, all these different
6361920	6368160	phenomena of quantum mechanics, you can start to have, I think, almost intuitive kinds of,
6370480	6374400	you know, kinds of views of what's going on there. I think it's, I mean, to mention one
6374400	6379200	from relativity that I think is very lovely. And by the way, there's an analogy in mathematics here
6379200	6385120	as well, time dilation and relativity. So, you know, if you are an observer who's going faster,
6385680	6391840	time to, to an observer, you know, the time appears to be progressing more slowly to an
6391840	6398000	observer who's going, going faster, the phenomenon of time dilation. So in our models, you have a
6398000	6404240	thing, it's represented by some sort of tangle in this network. And the thing is moving in this
6404240	6410480	network. Well, the process of motion requires a certain amount of computation. You've got a thing
6410480	6415280	in one place, it's got to reconstruct itself in another place, that takes a certain amount of
6415280	6421280	computation. But the progression through time also takes a certain amount of computation.
6422000	6428400	And the thing has a certain computation budget, so to speak, that is ultimately determined by the,
6428400	6433520	the fundamental processing power of the universe, you know, that's sort of the, the way of measuring
6434400	6440320	distances in the ruler. And so this, this, what you end up with is you can either use your
6440320	6447920	computational effort to sort of progress through time, or you can use it to rewrite your position
6447920	6452800	in space. But as soon as you're rewriting your position in space, you're using up some of that
6452800	6460080	budget. And so you don't get to evolve as quickly in time. And so you, you have to, you know, it's a,
6460080	6464400	that that's, that's why that's sort of the mechanical reason that time dilation happens.
6465200	6473680	So in the case of metamathematics, well, okay, let's see, there's, there's sort of a similar
6473680	6481440	phenomenon that has to do with, if you were investigating something in one theory, using
6481440	6486320	another theory, like algebra and geometry, you were, you were, you're trying to use algebra,
6486320	6492240	but you're studying geometry. And you're kind of going back and forth between algebra and geometry.
6492240	6499520	There's this translation cost that let's see how does this work. The, I mean, but basically the
6499520	6506720	time dilation phenomenon comes about because as you are trying to sort of think about geometry
6507440	6516000	in terms of algebra, let's say, you are necessarily incurring some, you're slowing down your progress
6516000	6520000	in geometry, because you keep on having to do this translation back and forth to algebra.
6520560	6526800	And that's a, that's, I'm not untangle all the pieces to this quite right. But, but that,
6527440	6531200	I think there's a phenomenon there that is similar to time dilation, which is very weird.
6531280	6538080	And, and by the way, these, these correspondences speak to sort of, you know, help convince me
6538080	6542480	that this picture that's sort of underneath both mathematics and physics is the same rule
6542480	6546800	here. The fact that there are these correspondences makes that encouraging. I mean, another, other
6546800	6552640	correspondences that what is a black hole in mathematics, a black hole, I think is a decidable
6552640	6560640	theory. So just as in, you know, in physics, there can be unbounded time. So in mathematics,
6560640	6565360	there can be unbounded proofs. But by the time you have a decidable theory, the proofs are going
6565360	6572880	to be bounded. And so that's like a decidable theory is like a black hole. And then, then you
6572880	6577520	have an physical space, you have all these singularity theorems that say when you have too
6577520	6583920	high a density of energy momentum, you inevitably form a black hole. In mathematics, the statement
6583920	6589120	would be when you have too high a density of proofs, you inevitably end up with a decidable
6589120	6595920	theory. And so this leads to very bizarre things, like for example, the future of the universe may
6595920	6601440	consist of a bunch of black holes, the future of mathematics may consist of a bunch of decidable
6601440	6607840	theories. And in other words, that the, that the sort of inexorable future of the universe
6607840	6612720	sort of is similar to the future of mathematics, so to speak. Another thing corresponding to
6612720	6620080	mathematics and physics is homogeneity in the physical world. That is, that we can move around,
6620080	6625120	you know, we believe that physics is kind of the same here as it is in the Andromeda galaxy.
6625760	6631840	In mathematics, the statement would be mathematics is kind of the same in the algebra place as it
6631840	6638080	is in the geometry place. So in other words, there is a, an inevitable translation from one field of
6638080	6644160	mathematics to another. If the mathematical universe is reasonably homogeneous, which I think I can
6644160	6649760	argue that it is, then it is necessarily the case that there will be these correspondences between
6649760	6654560	these very different areas of mathematics. And we see some evidence of this of all these kind of
6654560	6659840	dualities between different areas of mathematics and so on. But it's sort of interesting to see that
6659840	6665920	homogeneity in physical space, the analogy to that is the presence of these things. And I think,
6665920	6673360	by the way, in a recent thing that I've sort of come to, to imagine is that category theory,
6673360	6679520	for example, which is one example of a kind of a broad sort of structural sort of description of
6679520	6686480	lots of areas of mathematics. Category theory is a, is a characterization of a, so one feature
6686480	6692640	of category theory is you say, oh, we apply this morphism, then we apply this morphism. And category
6692640	6697680	theory says if you can apply this morphism, then that morphism, then there's always a morphism that
6697680	6704320	just jumps all the way. That's, that's just an axiom of category theory. That axiom can kind of
6704320	6709440	denies computational irreducibility. Because if each of those morphisms was a computational
6709440	6716640	irreducible step, then to say, oh, but there's just a supermorphism that jumps all the way is to
6716640	6721840	kind of say, but we're, you know, that there shouldn't be that supermorphism if you had to go
6721840	6729760	through all these computational irreducible steps. And so I think that that's, in a sense,
6729760	6736160	category theory is a, is a description of computationally reducible sort of, is a,
6736160	6740880	is that some kind of meta description of computationally reducible pieces of mathematics.
6742080	6747040	And, but it's, it's one of these things that I think is, is, you know, somehow there's a
6747040	6751680	correspondence between that and this thinking about sort of homogeneity in mathematical space.
6752720	6760080	Time does fly. And this was terrific. Thank you so much again for talking with me. And hopefully
6760080	6765520	our third round comes closer than the, to the second than the second did to the first. Thanks again.
6766320	6774480	Yeah, it was, it was great. Good stuff.
