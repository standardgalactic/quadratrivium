00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Hello, this is Robinson Earhart, here with the introduction to Robinson's podcast, number

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:14,800
196. And this episode is with the brilliant Stephen Wolfram, who is the founder and CEO

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:24,080
of Wolfram Research, the creator of Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, and the Wolfram Language. And

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,360
among his many other accomplishments, Stephen received his PhD in theoretical physics from

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Caltech when he was only 20 years old with the renowned physicist Richard Feynman on his committee.

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:43,360
This is Stephen's second appearance on the show, much to my delight. And in episode 102,

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:52,000
we talked about artificial intelligence, chat GPT, and then there was a lengthy and enjoyable

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,680
digression into the philosophy of math. In this one, though, we turn to another of Stephen's

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,800
ambitious projects, which is his search for the fundamental theory of physics, and how it has

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:14,400
led him to a very mysterious structure called the rouliad, which is the entangled limit of all

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,880
possible computations. That's a mouthful, but we'll get into that in a lot more detail. And

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,280
Stephen believes that the rouliad, though I don't want to put words into his mouth, so these are

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,960
my words, is the universe or that the universe is part of the rouliad. And observers like us are

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,960
simply embedded in the rouliad and experiencing it in different ways. We also, along the way,

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,640
get into some ideas in the philosophy of science, some metaphysics about abstract and concrete

16
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,120
objects, and then the foundations of quantum mechanics. A lot of the material that we discussed

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,840
can be found in Stephen's book, A Project to Find the Fundamental Theory of Physics, and in

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,160
writings on his website, including an article titled The Concept of the Rouliad, links to which

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:18,720
are in the description. He also does plenty of live streams, he posts plenty of other articles,

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,080
there are Q&As, so there's also a link to his website where you can find all of these things.

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,520
On my end, reviews, likes, comments, subscribes, these are all very much appreciated, and there is

22
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:39,280
also now a Patreon, a link to which is in the description. If you are interested in supporting

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:47,040
the show, add free episodes, there's an RSS feed to that, and then some very nice show notes and

24
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,000
takeaways. But now, without any further ado, I hope that you enjoy this conversation as much as I

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:10,880
enjoyed having it with Steve. Before we get to the rouliad, I want to start a bit with its history,

26
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,000
which I guess is also your history, and my understanding from talking with string theorists,

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,440
causal set theorists, loop, quantum, gravity theorists is that many other theories of everything

28
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,680
have come out of quantum gravity since general relativity and quantum field theory are two

29
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,760
best physical theories, but my understanding is that the rouliad did not come from this direction

30
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,280
at all. So where did your search for the fundamental theory of physics begin?

31
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,240
Well, it's complicated stories. So when I was a teenager, I was interested in physics, and

32
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,920
I became a pro before too very long, and I worked on quantum field theory and general

33
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,960
relativity, basically, particle physics and cosmology and so on. And that was in the late 1970s,

34
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:13,040
and at that time, I wasn't in the, let's find a theory of everything, I was in,

35
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,720
we have some theories, they're starting to actually work, things like QCD,

36
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,120
things about the early universe and cosmology and so on. Let's figure out the consequences of

37
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,200
these theories. And that was a fertile thing at that time. And it was, I managed to make some

38
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:34,320
progress on that. Then I got, I was making computational tools that I used, I don't know

39
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,680
why other people didn't use them, but at least at the time, there were these computational

40
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,680
tools for doing calculations in mathematical physics and so on. I used these to great effect.

41
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:54,000
Then in 1979, I kind of realized I had outgrown all existing computational tools, and well,

42
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,040
next step was build my own. So I started doing that. And that led to this thing called SMP,

43
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,200
which was kind of a forerunner of Mathematica and both in language. And in building SMP,

44
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:12,080
I kind of was a, this is, I want to make this computational system, what are, think about it

45
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,240
like a natural scientist, what are the kind of primitives of computation from which we can build

46
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:24,000
this. And so I did that, built the system, practical system, etc, etc, etc. And then I got

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,600
back into doing basic science. This is probably 1981 or so. And I had this, you know, this basic

48
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,080
question about sort of where does complexity come from in the universe. And that the sort of the

49
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,520
standard mathematical physics that I knew didn't tell me much about that. Well, I realized, and

50
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,600
this is sort of back projecting history, because at the time I wouldn't have explained it this way.

51
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,440
But the thing I realize now is that the experience of building this computational language SMP

52
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,400
back then, from sort of these abstract computational primitives kind of gave me the meta idea that you

53
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,480
could just sort of construct a theory from nothing, so to speak, that you could construct a theory,

54
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,560
sort of from the ground up, rather than doing what one traditionally does in natural science,

55
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,320
which is to say, look at the universe as it is, and try and say, how does one get to,

56
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,120
how does one reverse engineer the universe as it is. So that kind of experience of building

57
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,600
this computational system from sort of abstract primitives was the thing that kind of got me into

58
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,280
this idea of let's, let's see what happens when we just start from some abstract primitives and

59
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,440
build things from there. What, what do we get? Do we get something that's like the natural world?

60
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,360
Do we get something completely different? And then the big kind of set of discoveries that I made

61
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,920
about these things called cellular automata that are just, you know, simple rules applied to grid

62
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,320
lines of black and white squares and so on, that the big surprise was, if you just do the computer

63
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,840
experiments, you just sort of turn your computational telescope out into the computational universe,

64
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,640
you discover some remarkable phenomena, particularly you discover that even when the rules are very

65
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:13,520
simple, the behavior is complicated. And so that to me at first, that was a story of kind of the

66
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,280
explaining things in the natural world. How does one explain sort of the complexity of snowflakes

67
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,680
or turbulence and fluid flow? What are the underlying sort of foundational ideas, the kind of

68
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,000
sort of pre physics sort of abstract ideas that lead to this? It's not traditional mathematics,

69
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,360
it's not traditional mathematical physics. It's something different. It, I realized,

70
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,400
was this kind of computational foundation. So I worked on that for a number of years,

71
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:52,640
then I kind of had a sort of an attempt to build what ends up getting called complexity theory

72
00:07:52,640 --> 00:08:01,040
as a sort of, as an actual activity in the world. And the process of doing that convinced me, okay,

73
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,920
plan B is just figure out a bunch of stuff myself. Let's not wait for the rest of the world to do

74
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,760
this. Let's just figure it out myself. And that led me to start building mathematical

75
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:16,080
law from language and our company. And also in the end, this book, big book, a new kind of science

76
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:24,160
that I would now describe as being at its heart, it's a work of Ruleology. It's a given these rules,

77
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,480
what happens in the world. And the big surprise there was that sort of given these rules, the

78
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,040
given very simple rules, there was just a lot of richness in what happened and a lot of general

79
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,280
principles like the idea of computational irreducibility, the principle of computational

80
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:45,040
equivalence and so on, these kind of emergent general principles that I kind of realized were

81
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:52,000
there from having done this kind of essentially in a natural history study of Ruleology of kind

82
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,920
of what do rules out there in the computational universe do. Anyway, they're one of the use cases

83
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,360
for this kind of new kind of science based on sort of thinking about things computationally.

84
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,640
One of the use cases like couldn't avoid looking at was fundamental physics, because after all I

85
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,080
knew a bunch about fundamental physics. And the obvious question was, you can see that

86
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,960
from such a simple rule, you can get all this complicated behavior. So now the question is,

87
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,800
well, what about the universe? That's our sort of biggest example of sort of complicated behavior.

88
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,480
Could it to be the result of some very simple rule? Well, the first thing I knew was that

89
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,000
cellular automata weren't going to do it. That was what we know from relativity about the structure

90
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,480
of space and time and so on. Cellular automata say, let's start off assuming we know that sort of

91
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,600
things are laid out in space in a particular way, that they sort of update in time in a particular

92
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,200
way. We've already locked in the structure of space and time as this kind of grid. And that's not how

93
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,880
the universe actually works. Actually, I recently learned that back in the early part of the 20th

94
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,200
century, well, I knew that many physicists believed that, for example, spaces that was

95
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,480
discrete at that time. But I think Heisenberg in particular had a model of kind of discrete cells

96
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,760
in space that's very much like a cellular automata model. And he didn't actually make it work. And

97
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,520
the fact that he didn't had some interesting historical consequences. I didn't I didn't

98
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,480
really know that had been done by him at that time. But anyway, that wasn't going to work. So

99
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,040
early 1990s, I'm sort of thinking about this kind of thing. And the big idea at that time was the

100
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,680
realization that a network is a much more flexible structure from which you can potentially build

101
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,720
space than this sort of fixed grid. So that sort of a technical thing, it's like you imagine

102
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,440
that space is made of just discrete points. And the only thing those points sort of have to say

103
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,520
for themselves is how they're related to other points. So you're building up this kind of network

104
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,920
of relations. And then the result that I knew by the mid 1990s was much like when you look at a

105
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,800
fluid with a bunch of molecules bouncing around, what emerges from that molecular dynamics on a

106
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,040
large scale is fluid dynamics is kind of the large features of fluids. I knew that what emerged

107
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,840
from sort of the small scale of these this network and updates on the network and so on,

108
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,080
what would emerge on the large on a large scale with all sorts of sort of footnotes

109
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,480
was general stability, the structure of space and time as we are familiar with it from 20th

110
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,840
century physics. So it was kind of exciting. I didn't figure out quantum mechanics at that time.

111
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:41,680
I had ideas about it. I was frankly prejudiced from my own sort of desire, I suppose, to believe

112
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,840
that sort of the the the progress of history is somehow unique. And that there wasn't, you know,

113
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,400
that there weren't lots of copies of us all over the place doing different kinds of things.

114
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:59,120
And I didn't, you know, I didn't really see how that worked. So then I well, I kind of it was sort

115
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,040
of my my friends in physics at that time were like, like, you know, we hate the fact that you're

116
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,680
going off to this completely different idea about how fundamental physics might work from the

117
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,240
mathematical physics that we've all been doing for the last, you know, 50 or 100 years. And

118
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,560
so I was like, okay, fine, you know, the market doesn't want this, I'm going to go off and do

119
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,360
other things. So I worked on both Malphyr and computational language and all sorts of things

120
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:31,760
like that. 20, what was it, 2018, I guess, I kept on coming back to thinking about this kind of,

121
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,840
you know, what could one make progress with in fundamental physics. And the the thing that

122
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,920
that then happened was I sort of realized that there was some with some things I didn't like,

123
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,440
there were kind of arbitrary and the way that I done these set up these networks and things,

124
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,640
I made some progress, thinking about hypergraphs instead of ordinary graphs and so on, that helped

125
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,240
sort of unlock various technical aspects of things. Then 2019, a couple of young physicists who knew

126
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,040
about what I've been doing were like, you know, you can't just leave this project undone, you know,

127
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,200
you got to go forward and actually actually do something with this. And so that led to

128
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,200
something that went vastly more quickly than I expected in 2019 of building up our physics

129
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,520
project and actually understanding about how quantum mechanics works and turned out the thing

130
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,280
that I was afraid of doesn't actually happen for reasons that I could not did not previously foresee.

131
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:33,200
But the, okay, so so how does that work? This is a long tangled tail. I mean, the sort of big,

132
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:41,280
you know, the next big sort of injection of of kind of confidence building was the fact that

133
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,480
we seem to be able to reproduce the main features of 20th century physics from this underlying

134
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,960
completely abstract infrastructure. And but then there was still a problem, because the problem was,

135
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,520
I thought at first, we're searching for the fundamental rule, the fundamental computational

136
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:09,040
rule from which our universe comes. But that always bothered me, because it's like, we get to that,

137
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,040
it's kind of the end of Copernicanism in some sense, you know, we were, we keep on being told,

138
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,680
we're not special, you know, our planet isn't the center of the universe, etc, etc, etc.

139
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,080
So then if we find this rule, and it's one particular rule, we can hold it in our hands,

140
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,680
and maybe it's a simple rule that seems to us simple, why did we get the simple rule universe

141
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,160
and not some completely different universe. So that really bothered me for a long time. And as

142
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,200
is usually the case with these kinds of things, that, you know, it's like, I don't know how I'll

143
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,280
explain that, it's kind of like, in, you know, when Newton was doing sort of celestial mechanics,

144
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,920
we're saying, well, once the planets are set in motion, I can work out what happened. But,

145
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,080
you know, how did they get into their initial configuration? You know, that's the work of God,

146
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,680
so to speak, was what he said at that time. Same with Darwin trying to figure out, you know,

147
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,040
sort of the natural selection, but how did the first life come about? In both of these cases,

148
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,440
what we know from sort of the long run of history is that sort of the, it was a thing from outside

149
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,520
the systems that they were thinking about, that led them to eventually led people after them to be

150
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,960
able to understand, you know, how could a solar system form, etc. etc. etc. So in this case,

151
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:35,040
the thing that we realized was that this idea that you're searching for the rule, and then you

152
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,440
have to say, well, why this rule and not another, it's just not the right question. The, what's,

153
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,160
what's really going on, I think, is that all possible rules are being run. Now, we had a big

154
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,680
tip off to this, because in this network, and the network is continually getting rewritten,

155
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,160
and you're getting a new network at every moment in time, there are many different ways that that

156
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:05,040
rewriting can happen. And that leads to many different parts of history, where you've got this

157
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,040
network, it can be rewritten one way, it can be rewritten another way, those are two different

158
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,800
branches. After a while, the, the ways that it can get rewritten may end up with the exact same

159
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,840
network, two different branches may end up producing the same network. So then you have a merge in

160
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,720
this, in this thing, we call a multirate graph, which is this kind of graph of the histories,

161
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,280
possible histories of the universe, not possible, the graph of histories of the universe. And, and so

162
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,720
the kind of the, the first big tip off is that we're not looking for the history of the universe,

163
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:44,480
we're looking for this graph of these different histories of the universe. And, and in some sense,

164
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:51,200
the sort of the, I suppose, ontological sort of view of this is they're all happening. It's not

165
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,640
that we picked a particular one, it's they're all happening. And then the realization is that as

166
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:04,160
observers of the universe, we, our, our minds are also doing this kind of branching and merging

167
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,720
that the rest of the universe is doing. So this kind of how do we perceive the universe, it's the

168
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,720
story of how does a branching and merging mind perceive a branching and merging universe. And

169
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,960
that story ends up essentially being the story of quantum mechanics. And it's so, so kind of

170
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:26,000
this idea that we are an extended thing with respect to what we call branchial space, the

171
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,960
space of possible branches of history. So, so that was, that was kind of the, the realization there.

172
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,560
Then we realized, well, but you can take this even further, rather than taking a particular rule and

173
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:44,880
applying it in all possible ways. Let's just consider all possible rules. Now the question is,

174
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,480
so how do we perceive the thing you get from studying sort of the evolution of all possible

175
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,920
rules? You might say, how can you say anything definite from a thing where all possible rules

176
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:03,360
are happening? Well, it is in fact, a very rigid structure. You might think it's a big floppy thing,

177
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,000
because everything can sort of in some sense, everything can happen. But there is a dynamics

178
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,160
to it. It's not as if everything can sort of happen all at once. It's that there is, you know,

179
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,040
this thing happens, then that thing happens, there is a chain of causality about what happens.

180
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:26,400
And yes, it's sort of all possible chains to be followed. But there's, there's still a sort of a

181
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:33,920
very rigid structure to this whole system. And so then the, that thing, that sort of entangled

182
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:43,520
limit of all possible computations is what we call the Ruliad. And so now the point is that what one

183
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:51,280
has to think about is, if that's what there is, in some sense, what do we perceive about what there

184
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,840
is? Because we are part of the Ruliad. So the question of what we perceive about the universe

185
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,800
is a question of how do we, there's a certain kind of observer of the Ruliad. We're not observing

186
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:09,120
the whole Ruliad. We are observing some tiny little piece of the Ruliad. It's very much like in

187
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,320
physical space, we're sitting on this particular planet, you know, in this particular corner of

188
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,000
some particular galaxy. And so our perception of the universe is based on that particularity of

189
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,120
where we are. And there isn't really a theory of where we are, we are where we are, we can go and

190
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,720
trace back and say, well, you know, our galaxy evolved in this or that way. But, you know, once

191
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,560
we know where we are, so to speak, then we have a certain perception of the universe. And the point

192
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:44,240
is, the realization is, it's the same story with the Ruliad. That is, we are, we as observers are

193
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:53,280
sort of, we are taking a particular tiny slice of the Ruliad. Now, the big question is, so can we say

194
00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:00,160
anything sort of scientifically based on this? And the thing that I realized is that, that the key

195
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,720
observation is that for, it depends on what kind of an observer you are. If you were an observer

196
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,000
outside the Ruliad, observing the Ruliad from the outside, if you could do that, you would have

197
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
some conclusion about how complicated the universe is. But it actually, we're observers with some

198
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,920
very particular characteristics. For example, we are computationally bounded. Our minds are sort of,

199
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,720
you know, we have finite number of neurons, 100 billion neurons, whatever it is, we're bounded

200
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,840
in the computations we can do. And we already know, you know, I studied a bunch, the second

201
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,600
order of thermodynamics, law of entropy increase and so on. And that's a case where we, what we

202
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,800
observe is that all those molecules bouncing around, they seem to us random in the motions that they

203
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,400
have. Now, if we were to trace molecule by molecule and trace all the computations about how all the

204
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,520
molecules interact, we would say, they're not random. They follow very particular rules and we

205
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,080
can work out what they are. We can work out what the molecules will do. But the point is that,

206
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,240
as computationally bounded observers, we can't do that. So we kind of have to throw up our hands and

207
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:15,120
say, it looks random to us. And that's sort of an example of how being an observer of the kind

208
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,720
that we are necessarily leads us to certain conclusions about the way the world is. That

209
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,000
is, we believe in the second order of thermodynamics, because we are computationally bounded observers

210
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,200
observing this kind of irreducible computation of these molecules bouncing around. And so that

211
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,640
then leads us to the question of, well, given certain assumptions about us as observers,

212
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,160
what does that mean about the physics we can perceive? And I think there are two key

213
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,320
sort of features of us as observers, although I think there are other ones that seem so obvious

214
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,560
that they've never really been called out as assumptions about how the world works.

215
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,880
But the two that I think are critical for 20th century physics, at least,

216
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,400
one is that we're computationally bounded, and the other is that we believe we are persistent in time.

217
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:13,760
So it is not self-evident that we believe that there is a consistent thread of us

218
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,440
that goes through time, even though in this model of physics, at every moment we're made of

219
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:27,520
different atoms of space and so on. Even despite that, we believe that we persistently exist through

220
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,200
time. Well, it turns out that those two assumptions, computational boundedness and persistence through

221
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,840
time, those two assumptions with the mathematical structure of the Roulillade are sufficient to

222
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,760
give us the three fundamental theories of 20th century physics, which to me is completely

223
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:53,920
remarkable, because the fact that it is possible to derive laws of physics is something that is

224
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,600
at some level very surprising. I mean, the three kind of fundamental laws that we're talking about

225
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:06,320
that are the cornerstones of 20th century physics are statistical mechanics, where the main event is

226
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,800
the second law of thermodynamics, general relativity, theory of spacetime, and quantum mechanics.

227
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:20,320
And what has been believed in the past, what was believed from the 1860s on, is that look,

228
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,200
statistical mechanics, the second law of thermodynamics should be derivable in some way

229
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,280
from the laws of mechanics. Once you know how all these molecules bounce around,

230
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,560
it should just be a matter of pure mathematical derivation to show that they satisfy the second

231
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:42,000
law. Nobody's succeeded in showing how that works. In the end, I think the reason is that to understand

232
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,280
it requires understanding about observers and computational irreducibility and computational

233
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,880
validness and so on, which is a rather different kind of set of concepts than people were pursuing

234
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,480
in mathematical physics. But the thing that is then very surprising is general relativity and

235
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,760
quantum mechanics, both of these were seen by me as well as everybody else as kind of wheel-in

236
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,320
features of the universe. That is, we could have had a universe that has general relativity,

237
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,560
we could have had a universe that doesn't have general relativity, likewise quantum mechanics.

238
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:21,760
But what seems to be the case is that for observers like us, it is inevitable that what we

239
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:28,720
perceive must be a universe which has those particular laws. So now you ask, well, what's

240
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:36,000
the foundation of that? I mean, the Rulliard, in some sense, it's a necessary object. It's not an

241
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,200
object that is like, well, it happens to me this way. It is sort of as necessary as the fact that

242
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,080
2 plus 2 equals 4, given our definition of what 2 is and what plus is and so on. It's not, that's not

243
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,040
something we can wiggle out of. That's not something we can say, well, on Mars, 2 plus 2 might not be

244
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:01,760
equal to 4. Given our definitions, it is inevitable. And so, similarly with the Rulliard, given the

245
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,800
kind of the concept of computation, the abstract concept of computation, the Rulliard is a

246
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,440
necessary object. Strangely, it's an object and it surprises me as well as other people

247
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,560
that hadn't been studied before. It's an object that, in some sense, is an obvious object to

248
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,640
consider. I think the reason it wasn't studied, certainly the reason I haven't studied it,

249
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:27,040
is because, in a sense, computation, well, in my lifetime, computation has been gone from being

250
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:33,680
super valuable to being somewhat every day. But the profligate wasting of computation done by the

251
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:40,080
universe is something that it took me a while to kind of come to terms with. That is that there

252
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,600
could be, you know, all of this computation happening that is all irrelevant to, that's all

253
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,880
way below anything that we perceive. And that that was, and that there are all these different

254
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,000
branches of history and different rules being followed and so on. And that that, you know,

255
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,560
that sort of the universe is just doing all this computation was something that seems,

256
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,200
it felt like, well, actually, we should concentrate on the particular computation that we care about.

257
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:16,160
But in any case, I think the, so what's, I think you write that the Rulliard is sort of in its

258
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:22,400
origins is not a reverse engineering natural science effort. It is a, you know, a bottom up

259
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,960
effort of this is an abstract object, does it now relate to what we see in the world?

260
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,000
And as I say, in my personal history, you know, the fact that I ended up thinking about science in

261
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,400
those terms is a is a consequence of the of the of the pure coincidence that, you know, I worked

262
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,680
on sort of building computational tools for which I had to think about things sort of from the bottom

263
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,120
up. After I happened to learn about a bunch of things about sort of top down natural science.

264
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:59,120
Mm hmm. Well, that was wonderful. My hope, and I'll give you a break now, my hope with this time

265
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:06,480
is to get pretty deep into Rulliology, which is a new word for me. You've already taken us there and

266
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,160
presaged a lot of the things that I wanted to discuss. Before I go on, though, maybe I ought to

267
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,560
just, I have this quote here, it's basically a slogan, just to get maybe a sort of definition

268
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:25,520
of the Rulliad on the board for our listeners. And so you wrote that the Rulliad may be defined as

269
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,360
the entangled limit of everything that is computationally possible, i.e. the result of following

270
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:38,160
all possible computational rules in all possible ways. Yes, returning to what you were saying,

271
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:44,480
I'm not a philosopher of science. But like most people, I've read the structure of scientific

272
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:52,960
revolutions by by Kuhn a number of times. And what really struck me about what you were saying is

273
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:04,320
how closely this story sort of mirrors his picture of revolutions in some ways. So you

274
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:11,120
started out working in in normal science, so to speak, we already had these established

275
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:17,920
programs, general relativity and quantum field theory. And my understanding is that this is really

276
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:25,040
where some of the other theories of everything emerge from. So string theory comes out of

277
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:31,600
modeling the strong force, so on, and so forth. But then, yeah, and then the path integral

278
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:39,120
is a key part of causal set theory. But then a young person comes along. And of course,

279
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:48,880
you were well versed in these theories. But you throw it all away. And I think your words were,

280
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:56,480
you realize that you could construct a theory from nothing. And this is like the revolutionary

281
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,720
effort. And the normal scientists do not like this. And as you put it, like a lot of people

282
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,720
hated that you were going off and doing this in a completely different way.

283
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,920
I don't know if I have the book on my shelf. I don't know if it was in a project to find the

284
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:20,560
fundamental theory of physics, or it was it was in one of your posts on your website. But there was

285
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:27,920
this really funny cartoon where a dragon with cellular automata for teeth is about to chomp

286
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:33,360
down on a physicist who's writing equations in a blackboard. And I think this came out around the

287
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,120
time a new kind of science came out. You know, I just looked at this again when we were working on

288
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,440
the physics project and I was trying to try to explain its background. It was a review of a

289
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,080
new kind of science in the New York Times. It was a very, it was actually a very well written review

290
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:56,480
and a sensible review by a journalist. But the, I hadn't looked at this for, you know, for 20 years,

291
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,840
and I'd completely forgotten what was in it. But the thing that, you know, and at the time,

292
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,800
I was like, you know, why would my friends, the physicists, you know, they might not care about

293
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:12,400
what I'm doing? Why would there be any kind of negativity about it? And then I'm looking back

294
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,920
20 years later at this cartoon and, you know, realizing that from the outside, from the point of

295
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:25,600
view of this journalist writing this, this review, it seemed obvious to him that what this was was,

296
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:33,680
you know, as you put it, the dragon, you know, about to eat the sort of mathematical physicist.

297
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,640
But I think, you know, it's a funny thing because, for example, our physics project,

298
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,320
and now what's led to the Rulliard and so on, there are a whole series of sort of personal,

299
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:56,560
I don't know, circumstances that led to that path being a possible path, any one of which,

300
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:02,000
had they not been there, that path simply wouldn't have happened. And, you know, the fact that I've

301
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,680
sort of alternated between doing basic science and doing technology development, the technology

302
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:14,880
development drives this desire to kind of understand computation at a fundamental level for practical

303
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,280
reasons. You know, it's a somewhat strange kind of set of circumstances. And I think

304
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:31,600
you're right that the, I mean, the traditional, you know, physics went through a big kind of

305
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:39,200
transformation in the early part of the 20th century. And that transformation was, you know,

306
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,640
a lot of paradigmatic change. After that time, there wasn't a lot of paradigmatic change. There

307
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:51,440
was a lot of difficult technical work, but it was within that established paradigm. And it's,

308
00:31:52,240 --> 00:32:00,720
you know, I think the fact that we have, you know, my own efforts, you know, had somebody said to me

309
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,240
when I was in the middle of doing these things, you know, are you sort of purposefully inventing

310
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,840
a new paradigm? I would say absolutely not. I'm just, you know, pursuing things using methods

311
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,400
and techniques that I understand. What happened as I was writing my book, a new kind of science,

312
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,680
I did realize somewhere in the middle of that, gosh, this is a different approach to science.

313
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:31,280
That actually wasn't my, you know, initial take on things. And but that was, you know, in a sense,

314
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:37,040
what I realized was that the, you know, in the sort of the long view of sort of history of science,

315
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,800
there'd been a long period starting in the 1600s, when mathematics and sort of things like calculus

316
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,760
were the dominant way of explaining things in nature. I mean, there had been methods from

317
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,800
antiquity just saying, this is what things are made of. But then we had the sort of mathematical

318
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:01,440
mathematicalization of exact science. And the thing the question was, well, you know, is there more,

319
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:08,240
so to speak? And this was a realization. Yes, there is more. And in a sense, it was a thing

320
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,400
that was obvious, given the ambient technology of our time, namely, you know, computation, that

321
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:20,560
doing mathematics, it's sort of ironic that I've, you know, spent lots of effort sort of making

322
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:29,440
mathematics doable by computer. And yet, the in a sense, the bigger picture is the computation,

323
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,760
not sort of this specific corner of it that ends up being the mathematics that we've currently done.

324
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,360
In our, in our last conversation, we talked a bit about the formal mathematical dimensions

325
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,120
of the roulette and how it connects to mathematical logic. But I wonder if you think

326
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:58,720
that maybe one way of putting the crux of this paradigm shift and how science is performed

327
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,440
goes back to something you said earlier, but it's sort of an adoption of a formal mathematical

328
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,200
framework. The way people do math, formal math, where computational theory has its home, where

329
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,320
as you put it, though, physics is derived, laws of physics are derived, rather than

330
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,720
being reconstructed based on experiment, the way that it has been done in the past.

331
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:30,400
Yeah, I mean, I think it's worth realizing that it's a funny difference of paradigms between

332
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:36,400
mathematics and physics. I mean, we could do axiomatic physics. We could say, you know,

333
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:42,160
a bunch of experiments, we don't care what's underneath, we're just going to figure out,

334
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,760
you know, how to piece together one experiment and another. In mathematics, we are doing,

335
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,480
we are doing, you know, we often have thought of mathematics as an axiomatic business,

336
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,960
where we simply say, you know, we put down these particular axioms, and then we see

337
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,120
their consequences. We don't necessarily, in physics, we think there's a there there,

338
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:06,720
we think there is a physical universe that's sort of underneath the things that we observe.

339
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,680
In mathematics, you know, the prevailing view from the early 20th century had been,

340
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:20,720
it's just you make up your axioms, and then you work out their consequences as a purely

341
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:28,000
formal kind of thing. I think the thing that I sort of realized is that this process of working

342
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,040
out the consequences of axioms is the same kind of process as this process of figuring out what's

343
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,760
going to happen in the physical universe based on sort of these abstract structures, and the

344
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,880
particulars of, oh, well, you've got sort of kind of symbolic expressions versus you've got

345
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,120
hypergraphs, none of that matters. They're all, it's kind of all a big bucket of equivalent things.

346
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:02,160
And what's really going on in mathematics, as in physics, is that you are, you know,

347
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,240
to derive one theorem from another, you are sort of applying rules to get from that one

348
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,280
theorem to the other theorem, just as in physics, you're applying rules to get from one state of

349
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,040
the universe to another. So in the end, kind of the structure that you build, that is the kind

350
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,200
of underlying structure of mathematics, is in fact the same structure. It's just this really odd

351
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,480
structure. And sort of it's a weird thing, because in physics, we're used to thinking about, for

352
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,120
example, space in bulk. We don't, we're not, we're not personally, you know, acquainted with the

353
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,880
individual atoms of space. We don't give them names. In mathematics, in sort of axiomatic way

354
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,080
of thinking about it, we have things which are like the atoms of space. There's things even below

355
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:55,280
axioms, but let's take the level of axioms. But we give these particular sort of points in

356
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,400
mathematical space, we give them names, it's so and so is theorem or whatever else. We actually

357
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,120
don't tend to think of mathematics in bulk. You know, in the history of human mathematics,

358
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:10,560
people have proved, I don't know, few million theorems. There's, this question is, what is the

359
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,200
limiting structure of mathematics? If we just went on proving theorems, and we had a quadrillion

360
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,120
theorems, what would we, what would mathematics be like? And there's sort of this, and both

361
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:29,200
mathematics and physics are, I think, rooted in the Rulliad. They're both stories of what are the

362
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:34,640
consequences of possible computations. The big difference between mathematics and physics is

363
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,360
that the way we're sampling the Rulliad for physics is different from the way we're sampling it

364
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:45,920
from mathematics. So in physics, we are these kind of computationally bounded observers,

365
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,320
sort of progressing through time and experiencing through time. I think in mathematics, the better

366
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,640
view of the mathematical observer, still computationally bounded. But instead of sort of a progression

367
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,600
through time, there's more like, it's almost spatial, but not quite. There's sort of a,

368
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:09,040
you're putting more and more theorems in your bag of things you believe. So instead of, I'm

369
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:15,600
experiencing the history of my life, I'm kind of progressively sort of putting more things that I

370
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:23,120
believe are true into my bag of, a bag of beliefs, so to speak. And that that's kind of the, the, the

371
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:28,400
sort of progression of mathematics looks like that. And there are all kinds of, you could ask, well,

372
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,120
what are mathematical observers like? Can we conclude things about the structure of mathematics?

373
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:39,920
Just as from the nature of physical observers, we can conclude things about sort of global laws of

374
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,160
physics. Are there global laws of mathematics, for example? Mathematics, as we normally practice it,

375
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,760
is a kind of theorem to theorem kind of business. Whereas it's not a thing where we make bulk

376
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,360
statements about the structure of all possible theorems and so on. And sort of, but in physics,

377
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,440
we're not talking about physics at the level of individual atoms of space, or even at the level

378
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,240
of individual molecules when we're doing some dynamics, for example, we're talking about sort

379
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,200
of bulk properties. And so there's sort of a question, what are the, what are the bulk laws

380
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,440
of mathematics? The first bulk law of mathematics, I think, is that high level mathematics is possible,

381
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,600
which is not obvious. In other words, if you look at what, I don't know, a proof assistant system is

382
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:29,040
doing something, automated theorem proving system, you're looking at you say, let's, let's look at

383
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,240
mathematics at the level of really low level axioms, let's go all the way down to the sand

384
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,680
and start trying to build up mathematics. The, you know, that is a deeply inhuman activity.

385
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,720
I mean, it's a long time to find it. Yeah, but, but right, but it's also,

386
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:53,520
it's something where the typical thing you do that, you know, is it's made from tiny pieces

387
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,760
as a human looking at what's done by the computer, it's incomprehensible. Oh, right.

388
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:05,520
And, right. And it's some, you know, and I think the, and when you build up, if you want to build

389
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,440
up something that, you know, humans might talk about right on blackboards, you're talking millions,

390
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,520
billions, quadrillions of individual little axiomatic steps. Right, right. Humans can't

391
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,360
read formal proofs. Right. Normal, like, mathematical proofs that mathematicians

392
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:29,360
use are so not rigorous compared to what a formal mathematician would take as rigorous,

393
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,560
and even what they do is not at all what a computer would be reading at that.

394
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,640
Right, right. So I mean, you know, you can build up the structure of a completely formalized proof,

395
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,560
but it is way below the level of human mathematics. So, you know, I think the analogy that's useful

396
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,240
is to fluid mechanics, where there is a molecular dynamics, there are individual molecules bouncing

397
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,680
around, but we humans do not experience that we humans experience the overall flow of fluids and

398
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,520
things like this. And so it is with mathematics, I think, I think that deep but that that sort of

399
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:10,560
foundational axiomatic layer, it's not what we experience. You know, for example, we routinely

400
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,000
will talk about the Pythagorean theorem. What do we exactly mean by that? You know, what definition

401
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,480
of real numbers are we using? What axioms are we using for this or that thing about set theory and so

402
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,080
it doesn't matter. It's, you know, we can still talk about the Pythagorean theorem,

403
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:32,080
and we can do kind of human level fluid dynamics level mathematics, just batting around features

404
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:37,680
of the Pythagorean theorem without always grinding ourselves down and looking at the molecules,

405
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,920
so to speak, looking at those sort of individual microscopic axiomatic pieces.

406
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,400
And that I think is sort of the first sort of big law of mathematics is that that's possible,

407
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,200
that it is possible to do mathematics at the level of the Pythagorean theorem,

408
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,160
rather than at the level of the microscopic axioms of set theory and so on. You don't have to,

409
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,920
you don't have to go down to that level. And I think that's a, you know, that's a feature of

410
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:11,440
sort of mathematical observers like us, just as physical observers like us believe in space,

411
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:19,280
believe in thermodynamics and so on. So it is, I think, that mathematical observers like us

412
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,960
believe in kind of higher level mathematics. And, you know, it's sort of interesting because

413
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,040
there are places where we run into problems with that. You know, when we look at, you know,

414
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,360
when we run into undecidability in mathematics, when we run into Beatles theorem and so on,

415
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:42,320
those are places where we hit the edges. We can't look at things at the level of the sort of pure,

416
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:47,760
the sort of fluid dynamics where we just can, we're somehow forced to look down to that lower

417
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,160
sort of mathematical level. And I think that, you know, it's, that's a question that sort of

418
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,240
seeing down to the foundations of mathematics in a way that most mathematicians in their daily

419
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,200
work, they just don't care. That's, that's not important. And I for a long time, I was very

420
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,640
confused about why undecidability is so rare in mathematics. You know, that is, you know, we've

421
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,960
known since 1931, there are, you know, there are theorems whose proofs are arbitrary, long,

422
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,840
infinite, unprovable from a given set of axioms and so on. Why doesn't that, you know, when,

423
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,280
when it comes to figuring out the piece of mathematics that somebody cares about,

424
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:33,040
why is there a finite proof of it? And, you know, the, I sort of was, because for example,

425
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:39,200
when you look in the computational universe possible programs, many things you see there are,

426
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,520
you run right into undecidability. You, you know, many questions you might ask, there's no finite

427
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,600
computation that can answer them, etc, etc, etc. So why isn't this more common in mathematics?

428
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:57,600
And I think the reason is because mathematics, as we practice it, is the sampling of the Rulliard

429
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:03,200
done by mathematical observers like us, who, by the very nature of us as computation-bounded

430
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:09,920
observers, has, have this feature that we end up sort of believing in this higher level,

431
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,360
sort of fluid dynamics level mathematics. And that that's sort of why it's, it's because

432
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:21,520
if, if we were different kinds of observers who were looking down at the level of those

433
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,920
individual computations, we would be continually confronted with undecidability as we are when

434
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,880
we study sort of arbitrary things in the computational universe. But when we study things of the kind

435
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,680
that are, can be studied by a mathematical type observer, we end up most of the time just being

436
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,960
able to operate kind of fluid dynamics level without being forced down to this level where

437
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,680
there's lots of undecidability. And I think, so I mean, there's a, there's a lot of

438
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,840
this, the thing that, again, is, is sort of, I think, perhaps philosophically interesting

439
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,680
is this, you know, does mathematics exist in some sense? You know, is there a there there for

440
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:12,160
mathematics? And, you know, my, my belief nowadays would be that there's as much there there for

441
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:18,000
mathematics as there is for physics. You know, in physics, we just have this intuitive sense

442
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:25,040
that there is a universe out there that is sort of an objective thing that's out there. And,

443
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:32,960
you know, what, what, what one's saying is that, well, in the end, there's the really out out there,

444
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:40,080
but the sort of the way that we, the sort of the experiences we have are a consequence of the fact

445
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:45,440
that we're observers of the kind that we are. And the same, that the same is true for mathematics.

446
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,480
You, you said, just like, just a minute ago, you said that you think this is

447
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,640
philosophically interesting. And I can confirm that it is a philosophical gold mine. And I mean,

448
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:03,360
this is a good example of how this new kind of science might require a new way of thinking

449
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,920
of doing or thinking about philosophical questions. I mean, not just in philosophy of

450
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,120
mathematics or philosophy of science, but in metaphysics and epistemology and all of these

451
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,920
areas. But for the moment, though, I'd like to stick with science because there are some really

452
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,880
big questions there and some big distinctions that I'd like to clear up. And the first is between

453
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:30,960
theory and object. And I mean, I suppose one might define physics as it has been done

454
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,280
so far as the study of matter and energy and the fundamental building blocks of the world.

455
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:43,600
But there's a distinction between the theories that a physicist develops and then the world that

456
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:50,800
they describe. But I hear when I hear you talk, I hear about the Ruliad as an object, like the

457
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:57,520
world or the universe, or a multiverse, maybe, but it also seems like it's our fundamental

458
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,680
theory of the world in a way too. So the question is, what the physicist, what the physicist is

459
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:10,720
doing here? Is the physicist developing theories that describe the Ruliad or is sampling and

460
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:17,440
understanding the Ruliad, sampling and understanding the theory itself? Or do these things break down?

461
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,560
It's sort of a question of what is science? What is natural science? And the way I see it is,

462
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:28,960
natural science is kind of a translation layer between kind of the underlying computation,

463
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,280
the underlying world as it is, and the stuff that we can sort of talk about and think about with

464
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:42,720
our minds. So in other words, what we've got kind of the things that are just happening out there,

465
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,560
and we've got our way of describing what's happening. And I think that the fundamental

466
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:54,080
role of natural science is to figure out of all the stuff that's happening out there, what can we

467
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:00,080
parse out that we can package in such a way that we can kind of have a narrative about it in our

468
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:05,040
minds? I mean, there is something that's just happening out there. But the question is, what is

469
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,800
it that we, you know, how do we talk to ourselves about what's happening out there? And we are only

470
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,920
sampling tiny pieces of what's happening out there. But I think to your question about sort of,

471
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:22,160
it's almost, I was surprised that I was able to say anything about this, but the why does the

472
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,840
universe exist question? You know, because there's, you know, you can say, well, I've got this theory,

473
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:34,320
but why is the theory actualized? In what sense, you know, what breathes the fire into the universe,

474
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:40,400
so to speak? What, you know, what is, and, you know, I suppose from a, and I don't know all the

475
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,520
philosophical history here, but, but, you know, I certainly know the quote from Spinoza about,

476
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:51,440
you know, the universe is the thoughts of God actualized, so to speak. And it's, it's kind of,

477
00:48:51,440 --> 00:49:00,000
you know, it's, it's a, this question of what is, how does one think about sort of,

478
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:10,320
what is actualization in a situation where what we somehow, and I'm, this is, this real-time

479
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:16,560
philosophy is a bit, is a bit too hard, I think, but it's, I know when, you know,

480
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,760
my mother was a philosophy professor, which caused me to say that if there's one thing

481
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,360
I'll never do when I'm growing up, it's being a philosopher. But one of the things that,

482
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:31,440
one of the many things that I sort of would give a hard time to about some, about philosophy was that

483
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,880
the, you know, the Oxford philosophers would give a talk and they would read every word of this talk.

484
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,600
And it's like, that's very, you know, that's very wooden, you know, you can do better than that.

485
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,680
But actually when you have to really, you know, get all these distinctions correct,

486
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:53,440
it's actually pretty hard to do that in real time. So it's, it's, so I'm, I'm,

487
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:00,640
but this question about sort of, okay, so I think on this question about sort of why does the

488
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:08,080
universe exist? Why is anything actualized? I think that the way to think about that is

489
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,800
there isn't really a question of why the Ruliat exists any more than there's a question of why

490
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:21,760
2 plus 2 equals 4 exists, right? It's just an abstract thing. So now the real question is sort of

491
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:29,680
then we have the sort of a prior knowledge that we are perceiving this thing, we are here

492
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:37,040
perceiving this thing. It is in a sense less obvious that we should exist than that this

493
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:43,360
abstract thing should exist. But, but in a sense by the very fact that we're here doing the perceiving,

494
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:51,120
we know that if we want to describe something as existing, we, you know, we know that we're here,

495
00:50:51,120 --> 00:51:00,000
so to speak. And so I think the kind of the, the why, why is there a, you know, I suppose it comes

496
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:10,560
down to asking why, you know, why is the universe, why is there a perception of something like the

497
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:17,120
universe out there that we have access to? And my, I think the answer would be that it is

498
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:24,320
the Ruliat is this inevitable thing. The given that you know that we're here as observers,

499
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,720
you know, having a perception of things, it is inevitable that the things of which we have can

500
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:36,640
have a perception are these are is this abstract object, because the abstract object doesn't,

501
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:42,320
you know, the abstract object is the only thing we have to argue, the only contingent fact,

502
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:48,800
and even this gets more complicated. The only contingent fact is that we are computational

503
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:59,200
and not, for example, hyper computational. That is the fact that we exist as a place in the Ruliat.

504
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,040
So the Ruliat is sort of this entangled limit of all possible computations,

505
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:11,760
computation, something that follows rules. But as we start to say, what precisely do we mean by that?

506
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:17,440
We might say follows rules like a Turing machine, or like a cellular autonomous or like a network

507
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:23,040
rewriting system, those are all equivalent. Those are all computations of the standard thing that

508
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:28,320
we refer to as computation. But if we're just thinking about it, we can say, well, let's take

509
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:34,720
things that are undoable in finite time by any computational system set up in this way. Let's

510
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:41,600
just say we have a magic box that can do those those hyper computations do computations do in

511
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:47,200
finite time, computations that would take an infinite time for any computational system of

512
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:55,440
the kind that we're describing. Let's say that we have a hyper computational system. Well,

513
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,000
then we could start building up a Ruliat from hyper computation as well. We can build up a

514
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,840
hyper Ruliat, we can build up an infinite collection of hyper Ruliat. So the question

515
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:13,280
that is again, not I think is a contingent fact about the world. Okay, there's going to be an

516
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,320
interesting footnote to this. But the initial observation would be the fact that we are in

517
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:25,280
the Ruliat and not in the hyper Ruliat is something that is no more derivable than the fact that we're

518
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,880
in this galaxy rather than some other galaxy. And it's just we happen to be here. That's the first

519
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,000
first level of I don't so much like that explanation. And as I said, I think, well,

520
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,840
we're about to about to come to an even more bizarre point, which is but but but so

521
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:49,520
and and well, we say, Well, what about let's just go observe the hyper Ruliat? Well, you can't do that

522
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:57,040
from inside the Ruliat is kind of an event horizon that prevents you ever having any kind of causal

523
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,400
connection to things in the hyper Ruliat. By the way, there's a whole hierarchy of these things.

524
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:10,800
Within our universe, there are things that don't have all of the kind of richness of our universe,

525
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:18,480
namely, black holes, you know, you know, I wrote a piece about about cats. So we'll have to talk

526
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:24,800
about that. Yeah, right. They, which is relevant to the Ruliat, but we'll, we'll, we'll get to that

527
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,160
perhaps. The in the case that the thing that

528
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,360
the thing is sort of interesting, perhaps, is we have our universe, which is sort of a

529
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:43,200
computational kind of thing. And then we have things like black holes. And one feature of sort

530
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,720
of the simplest kind of black holes is time stops. In other words, in our universe, we believe

531
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,200
time just keeps going, keeps going, keeps going. But in a typical black hole with a space like

532
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:59,200
singularity, there's a time just stops. In our models, it's pretty easy to see how that works.

533
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:05,760
There are these rewrite rules, and there's just no rules to apply. But the point is that what would

534
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,920
in our universe would be this thing where we say, well, you can have arbitrary long proofs,

535
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:16,240
you can have arbitrary long sort of experiences of the universe. And if you are stuck inside a

536
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:22,000
black hole, you don't have that. So similarly, from the point of view of the hyper Ruliat,

537
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:29,440
our whole Ruliat's worth of experience looks like a black hole. It looks like gosh, you can't,

538
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:35,040
it's not quite time is finite in the sense that well, time is time is infinitesimal relative to

539
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:41,120
the what can be achieved in all the time of our universe is infinitesimal compared to what can

540
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:48,320
be achieved in a moment of time in the hyper universe. And so that okay, so now one of the

541
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:54,080
things which is again one of these. So you say, well, we got the Ruliat, we got the hyper Ruliat,

542
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:59,600
why did we get stuck in the Ruliat? Why didn't we have a, you know, why aren't we in hyper Ruliat

543
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:07,040
numbers such and such? I'm pretty sure that there is a notion of Rulial Relativity, that basically,

544
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:14,720
once you are an observer that have certain level of computational capability, that it is your

545
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:21,600
experience of the world is necessarily the same. In other words, if you're an observer in any level

546
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:30,320
of the hyper Ruliat, you are your, you know, when you perceive things, you will, if you're in a

547
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:36,880
hyper Ruliat, then your perceptions are hyper relative to what they would be in our Ruliat.

548
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:44,880
But if you are, but that you match the level of Ruliat that you're in. And so I think, I mean,

549
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,920
we still need to work out the details of this, but I think that it's going to end up that it

550
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,520
doesn't matter, that you're, that kind of, that there is no, that that removes that piece of

551
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:01,040
contingency, so to speak. But I'm not sure, let's see, I forget how we got to this now, but

552
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:11,200
but the, I mean, we're talking about kind of the necessity of the, well, the existence of the

553
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,400
universe, why is it necessary that the universe should exist? And my claim is that these abstract

554
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:28,640
constructs necessarily exist. And that the, the once you, the question of whether, well, okay, so,

555
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,600
I think I managed to get a bit further than this, and I'm, I'm trying to remember what the,

556
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:38,480
what all the arguments were here. But this, this question of whether,

557
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:45,440
yeah, the issue is, within the Ruliat, why is there a thing that is like an observer?

558
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:54,080
Why should, why should there be anything that is like an observer like us? And I think that,

559
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:00,080
so, so one question is, what does an observer like us fundamentally do? And I think the answer is,

560
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:07,040
what observers do is they take the complexity of the world, and they try and stuff it into a finite

561
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:13,440
mind. Because, you know, there is all the stuff going on out there, but we don't perceive that

562
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:19,760
stuff. We perceive this tiny, you know, tiny trickle of information. I mean, we're, you know,

563
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,880
the photons falling on our eyes, there are zillions of them every second. But yet,

564
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,640
all we perceive is I'm looking at a face or something. In other words, we are equivalencing

565
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,400
and the same thing in a much more physical setting. Imagine we're trying to measure the

566
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,120
pressure of a gas, and we have a piston, we got some, you know, and all the gas molecules are

567
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:43,360
hitting the piston. And there's a zillion configurations of these gas molecules. But all

568
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:47,840
that matters in measuring the pressure of the gas is what the aggregate force on the piston is.

569
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:54,160
And so that, that measuring process is equivalencing a large number of states of the world.

570
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,960
And I think that's, that's the essence of a computationally bounded observer,

571
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:06,800
is that you have to equivalence lots of states of the world to stuff your experience of the world

572
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:12,800
into, you know, a finite mind, so to speak. And so then the question is, you know, you start

573
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:19,600
asking, well, you know, are there pieces of the Rulliard, are there pieces of what's possible

574
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:27,600
that we can interpret as kind of a thing that is equivalencing things and, and sort of reducing

575
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:36,560
them to something where we can, where, where we can interpret it in this way. And I think it's

576
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:43,040
one of the features, one of the sort of scientific facts is this phenomenon that within any

577
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:49,120
computationally irreducible system, there are necessarily an infinite number of lump of sort

578
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:54,480
of pockets of computational reducibility. So to unpack that a bit. So given that you have a set

579
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:02,320
of rules, and you say, I'm going to run these rules, you might say, if we know the rules for a system,

580
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:07,920
then we're done. We know how the system's going to behave. And that was what people sort of assumed

581
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:14,400
was true. But it isn't true. Because what happens is the working out of those rules involves a

582
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:20,160
certain amount of computation. And it can involve an irreducible amount of computation. So if you

583
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,200
say, I want to know what's going to happen a million years from now, it's like, sorry, the only way

584
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,960
you can work that out is to live through those million years and do all those computations.

585
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:35,360
That is not, you know, the conceit of mathematics in a sense, is you just solve the equation,

586
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:40,640
or you fill in the numbers in the formula and you're done. There is a quick way to work out what's

587
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,520
going to happen. But the difference, the fundamental difference between sort of the mathematical

588
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:50,800
paradigm for thinking about science, I think, and the computational one is in the computational one,

589
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:56,160
you're given a rule, and then you have to run it to find out its consequence. It's not,

590
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:03,520
you can just nail it and have something which is kind of finite mind narrative of this is the

591
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:09,680
mathematical result. So there's this phenomenon of computational irreducibility. It is, I think,

592
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:18,480
it is a really central phenomenon. I mean, if there's one thing that I think is sort of a

593
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,600
takeaway from lots of things that I've done, it's the idea of computational irreducibility,

594
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:30,400
because it's what leads to, you know, it has consequences all over the place. It has consequences

595
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:37,440
for, well, for things like free will, it has consequences for, you know, if we say, if there

596
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:44,640
wasn't computational irreducibility, then the passage of our lives and the passage of time

597
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,760
would not really mean anything. Because we'd always be able to say, you know, you lead your life,

598
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:56,800
you live out many decades or whatever, but the answer is 42, you know the end, you can just jump

599
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:03,840
to the end. The fact that we have to experience all of those intermediate steps is a consequence of

600
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:08,640
the phenomenon of computational irreducibility. It's also in a quite different domain, you know,

601
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:13,520
if you're thinking about, you know, AI, and you say, I'm going to put in these rules for AI

602
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:18,880
governments, and they're going to work perfectly. It's like, well, no, they're not, because there

603
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:24,400
will always be an unexpected thing that happens, because the working out of those rules will show

604
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:30,720
computational irreducibility. And it's computational irreducibility is a completely ubiquitous thing

605
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:38,480
among systems rules. But the thing then that's surprising, okay, so given computational irreducibility,

606
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:44,720
why is science possible? In other words, why is it possible to make statements about the world

607
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:50,720
that are useful narratives of finite minds? It, you know, you might say it's just hopeless,

608
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:58,960
we can't figure out anything. The thing that is then a sort of a fact about computational

609
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:04,000
irreducibility, it is inevitable that within a computational irreducible system, there'll be

610
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,640
an infinite number of pockets of reducibility of places where you can make a little prediction.

611
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:16,640
And if you, it's rather a fairly easy argument that if that wasn't the case, if it was sort of

612
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:22,720
uniform computational irreducibility, you could use that very fact to make predictions. And so,

613
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:27,920
you know, that that sort of diagonal argument gives you gives you this result. But then so that

614
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,000
means there are all these pockets of irreducibility. What are those? What are those? Well, those are

615
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,880
the places where those are what we live in. You know, the fact that our lives are somewhat our

616
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:42,480
universe is somewhat predictable is because we're looking at a slice of reducibility in all of this

617
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:48,320
computational irreducibility. That's throughout the Roulillade, we are sampling a piece of it,

618
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:54,640
observers like us sample a piece of it that represents a pocket of reducibility. And by the

619
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:58,560
way, there are a lot of other things that those sort of pockets of reducibility correspond to,

620
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:03,760
like, for example, I think technology, you know, scientific discoveries, technology,

621
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,560
these are all examples of pockets of reducibility. You know, the world's a complicated place,

622
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:13,920
but we can make a scientific statement. You know, the fact that science is possible is science is

623
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:19,680
possible because there are these pockets of reducibility. And that's essentially where,

624
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:24,800
you know, where the science lives. That's what the science is doing is it's identifying,

625
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:29,040
you know, these pockets of reducibility. By the way, that has another consequence, which is

626
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:35,120
science will never be finished. There are always more pockets of reducibility. That's not self

627
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:40,320
evident, I think. It could be the case that, you know, if it wasn't for computational irreducibility,

628
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:45,920
then we would say we found the rules of the universe were done. But that's not correct,

629
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:51,360
because of irreducibility. But it's still got to be the case, even given the irreducibility,

630
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:56,160
that we can say things, and there'll be an infinite sequence of things we can say. I mean,

631
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:00,240
it's the same thing with technology. There's a question of how will, will there be a moment

632
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:06,240
when every invention has been made? And the answer is no, because inventions are these places where

633
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:11,120
you're getting sort of your, your making use of some pocket of reducibility. I mean, that the

634
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:17,360
footnote to that is, one thing that could happen is every invention that we humans care about has

635
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:24,080
been made. I don't think that happens because I think that the domain that we care about gradually

636
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:30,160
expands. And I think that's, you know, one thing I, you know, a sort of a little bit of a whimsical

637
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:36,880
way to talk about it. But, you know, we, the progress of science and sort of the arch of

638
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,680
intellectual history is a story of kind of, you know, additional paradigms, additional ways to

639
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:46,720
measure things about the world and so on. And the question is, you know, if we look at our,

640
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:55,040
our sort of presence in the Rulliard as a species or something, one aspect of our expansion is we

641
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:59,040
send out spacecraft when they go a certain number of, you know, astronomical units away from us.

642
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:07,440
That's exploring physical space. The growth of paradigms, I think, is a growth in Rullial space

643
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:14,720
that we're gradually sort of putting, there is more, there are more domains of that there's

644
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:22,560
sort of more descriptions of the universe that we can put in our bag of things that we can stuff

645
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:30,480
into our minds. So in other words, we're, as we invent a new paradigm, we are able to sample

646
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:35,280
where we're, we're sort of exploring more parts of the Rullia, we're exploring more different

647
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:41,120
kinds of rules that we can use to sort of talk about the universe and so on. So that's, that's

648
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:48,640
so it's kind of a sort of the expansion of, you know, in, in our, we can, we can make a choice

649
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:55,600
that you can set up more spacecraft, we can do more theoretical science and, you know, or some

650
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:00,320
more experimental science and find, you know, more different kinds of measurements that we can make,

651
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:07,600
you know, we start some. So these are, we can move farther or get smaller. Yes. Yes. Well, right,

652
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:12,160
I mean, that's another issue. It's another very interesting thing I think about us as

653
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:18,160
sort of a contingent fact about us as observers, we're actually pretty big. That is, if we're,

654
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:23,840
the universe is, you know, 10 to the 26 meters across in physical space, and we're give or take

655
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:30,800
a meter tall, you know, we kind of think the elementary length, the sort of the, the, an effect,

656
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:35,680
the effective distance between atoms of space or something might be 10 to the minus 100 meters.

657
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:40,720
So relative to that, where maybe, I don't know, that estimate is right,

658
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:46,480
where 100 orders of magnitude bigger than we, than the smallest and 26 orders of magnitude smaller

659
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,960
than the biggest, so to speak. So we're pretty big. And, and there's sort of a question of,

660
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:58,000
what's that? Good for the ego. Yeah, right. Well, okay, we'll get to, don't get too confident there,

661
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:05,520
because I think we're big in physical space in, in the Rulliard in rural space, we're pretty damn

662
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:11,760
small. In other words, you know, so one, one sort of way of, of probing that question, really that

663
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:18,720
the question of how big are we in rural space is the question of, of sort of, how do, what is the

664
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:24,640
diversity of, of what different kinds of minds can perceive? You know, if we have some point in,

665
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:30,720
in the Rulliard, then, then with minds of the kind we have, and each of us has a different

666
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:36,400
mind, so to speak, where all these little points in rural space, humans with similar kinds of,

667
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:42,720
you know, backgrounds or whatever might be quite close in rural space, your, your cat there is a

668
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:49,920
little bit further away in rural space. Although, you know, we can recognize, you know, certain

669
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:55,360
features, the emotional, you know, characteristics of the cat are sort of recognizable to us, even

670
01:08:55,360 --> 01:09:00,960
though cat philosophy is probably not something that, you know, if there is a cat philosophy,

671
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:06,000
we don't, you know, we don't know what it is. And I think it's very tuna-centric.

672
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,960
Yeah, right. That's, that's, you know, I do think that the modern times of machine learning,

673
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:20,480
one of the things that, you know, the talk to the animals thing should be a thing. The main block

674
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:28,240
is this question of sort of the, the distance in rural space, the kinds of things that, you know,

675
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:34,880
that one might talk about may be so bizarrely different, that they're not things where, you

676
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,520
know, it's a, again, it's like science, it's like this translation layer between, you know,

677
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:45,280
science is a translation between the natural world and what goes in our brains. And this is

678
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:51,360
sort of a level of a science-like thing that is, you know, the translation from what's going on in

679
01:09:51,360 --> 01:10:01,680
the animal brain to what's going on in ours. But I think, let's see, we were, yeah, right. So, I mean,

680
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:08,320
in, you know, this question of how big is the space of possible alien minds? What is the diversity

681
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:13,760
of possible ways to look at the universe? And I did a little experiment. It's a very, very,

682
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:23,360
I would say, sort of very basic approach to that question, which is, think about an AI and you're

683
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:32,160
thinking about kind of a generative AI system. And, you know, the typical image generation AI

684
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:40,160
system has been trained on billions of human produced images. And then it's generating things

685
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:46,720
that are like those human produced images. And so you can start asking, well, that's a mind that's

686
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:51,600
aligned with a human mind, because it's trained from human produced images. But you can like take

687
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:57,440
that mind and just start changing the weights and the neural network. And then you have something

688
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:04,240
which is not quite like, you know, it's kind of, it started from a human mind, but now it's,

689
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:09,840
it's sort of modified relative to, to that human mind. And you can start asking, well, what are the

690
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:15,120
images that you produce in that, in that case? There's even a simple thing you can do. You can

691
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:24,480
just say every, every image that is generatable is, there's this kind of latent space, there's this

692
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:33,680
kind of sort of numerically defined, coordinated space of possible images, so to speak. And you

693
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:40,560
can just say, well, there's a particular region of that space that corresponds to a picture of a cat.

694
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:48,160
And as we change our coordinates in that space, we'll make other kinds of pictures. And so then

695
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:55,040
the question is, there are some pockets of that space that correspond to human concepts, cats, dogs,

696
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:01,520
elephants, whatever, right? And the question would be, if you look at that whole space,

697
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:07,840
what fraction of the space is covered by those human concepts? So for example, one of the things

698
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:13,040
that, you know, I made some pictures of is cat island, the, you know, the thing which is

699
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:19,040
near the concept of a cat. As you go further away, you stop, you see pictures that don't really look

700
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:24,560
like cats anymore. And pretty soon they, they degrade into things that are not really recognizable

701
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:30,560
by us humans as pictures of anything that we know about. So even in the simplest case,

702
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:37,520
the region of, in a sense, rural space, that there's a small tiny slice of a real space,

703
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:43,280
but the region that corresponds to concepts that we are familiar with is about one part in 10 to

704
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:50,960
the 600. So in other words, the stuff, the, the, the part of rural space that we are familiar with,

705
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:56,720
even in this very simple slicing of rural space is an absolutely infinitesimal fraction.

706
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:01,760
What's, what else is out? You know, I was referring to it as inter concept space.

707
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:07,920
There is, you know, dotted around the space are concepts that we humans have decided to

708
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:15,840
invent so far in our, in our sort of civilizational history. But in between those concepts, it's

709
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:22,960
like interstellar space. There's, there's things that we haven't explored yet. And those are huge

710
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:29,440
compared to the ones that we already explored. So in some sense, we are that that's a, and by,

711
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:34,800
but by the way, I mean, what we, what we can imagine is that over the course of time, we will

712
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:42,720
gradually bring into our kind of domain of knowledge more and more things that are sort of out there

713
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:48,640
in this, in the space. So, so an example would be, you know, go back 50 years, we're making these

714
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:54,000
pictures, some things that show up in these pictures are nested fractal patterns. If you

715
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,840
go back 50 years, and you saw those things, you're just kind of like just shrugging your

716
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,600
shoulders. I don't know what that is. It's just something I don't really know about or care about.

717
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,080
Now that we know about fractals and nested patterns, we immediately say, oh, that's a

718
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:14,080
fractal pattern. And no doubt there are many other things out there in that space, where in time,

719
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:18,400
for whatever reason, we may start caring about these things, we may give them names

720
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:25,200
in our human languages and so on. And, and then that may be part of our sort of domain of things

721
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:30,880
we think about. I mean, it gives one, there's a sort of a funny twist, which I don't know that I

722
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:36,400
fully understand yet, which is, you know, you say, well, what's the future of history? Well, it's,

723
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:41,600
it's kind of like we explore interstellar space and physical space and so on. And then we explore

724
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:47,520
the Rulliad. We go on exploring more and more of the Rulliad. And kind of the story of intellectual

725
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:52,400
history could be the story of sort of just expanding, expanding, expanding the Rulliad space.

726
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:56,880
They say, well, then eventually we get to this wonderful situation where we've expanded throughout

727
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:02,480
Rulliad space, we're done, we've discovered everything. The problem is, I think in that case,

728
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:09,760
by the time we've expanded our mind to encompass everything, our mind is no longer coherent.

729
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:17,760
We no longer coherently exist. That is, I think that the, the, you know, coherent existence

730
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:26,720
requires sort of, in some sense, smallness. If you, if you are everything, then you're not,

731
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:34,160
there's no coherent you to the whole story. There has to be a, you know, the fact that we,

732
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:41,280
that we, we have coherent minds that believe that we have definite experiences and things

733
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:47,600
like that. I think as a consequence of the fact that our minds are not, you know, they're limited,

734
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:53,040
so to speak. If it wasn't for that, we wouldn't, you know, we wouldn't have this kind of coherent

735
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:58,640
sense of being us, so to speak. And so I think it's kind of a, a be careful what you wish for

736
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:03,360
situation, but it's like, yes, we, you know, we just succeeded. We expanded throughout Rulliad space.

737
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:11,200
The problem is now we don't coherently exist. And, you know, I think that's some,

738
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:16,640
I think that has all sorts of resonance with, with things people talk about in many kind of

739
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:22,240
Eastern traditions and philosophy and so on, which are, you know, I find it interesting how little

740
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:28,000
I understand about those things. Because in a sense, that's a story of, of one's kind of limitation

741
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,040
in Rulliad space. And that, you know, I've grown up in sort of a Western thought tradition, so to

742
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:38,480
speak. And it's really difficult for me to understand, you know, even if there is some there, there,

743
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:44,800
it's, you know, I, with my way of thinking about things, it's like I try and, I try and approach

744
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:49,360
it with my way of thinking about things and it just doesn't quite fit. I mean, this particular

745
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:54,720
point is perhaps the point of contact between these kinds of different, different ways of

746
01:16:54,720 --> 01:17:02,720
thinking about things. Well, these notions of exploring the Rulliad, of sampling the Rulliad

747
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:09,600
of the translation layer. I mean, it all just raises, it raises so many more classical questions and

748
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:17,600
epistemology and metaphysics and the philosophy of science. And you said a while ago now that

749
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:26,000
natural science is what we can parse about what's happening out there. And you also said,

750
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:34,480
with regard to the Rulliad, I mean, it's this necessary abstract object. And that we have

751
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:42,720
this perception of it. But where I'm getting at is that physics is generally considered to

752
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:50,000
concern, I mean, quite naturally, the physical world, though, I mean, physical or material,

753
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:55,760
these terms, they get a bit murky when one starts talking about things like fields and

754
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:03,040
wave functions and so on. But even though I mean, physical objects like the computers we're using

755
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:10,160
right now, they do carry out calculations and so on. But computation itself is an abstract

756
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:17,200
process. And the Rulliad itself is to use reference that quote again, the entangled limit

757
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:21,920
of everything that is computationally possible. So it's like a, it's a collection of equivalence

758
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:29,920
classes or something of that. And so I wonder then, whether ultimately you view the universe as a

759
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:35,600
physical object or an abstract object, or these categories just somehow don't make sense anymore

760
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:40,000
at this level of discussion, or whether we're physical, I think they don't make sense. Because

761
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:48,720
I think that, you know, all, yeah, I mean, all, all I, all I know is what I perceive. And, you

762
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:59,040
know, it's not to have the, you know, you might say, that's a very, and I know there are traditions

763
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:05,040
and philosophy where, where one sort of gets oneself tangled up by thinking that way, and saying

764
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:10,720
there's no, there's no there outside, so to speak. It's a little different in what I'm talking about,

765
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:17,840
because there is that there is something there, it's the Rulliad. But it's not this question of

766
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:30,640
whether there is a, you know, is there a, is there a thing that makes in what sense is, you

767
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:38,480
know, a solid object more real than some concept of mathematics? I mean, that's, that's kind of the,

768
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:47,920
you know, they, that I suppose, yeah, I mean, there's this question about what's out there

769
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:54,000
in physical reality. You know, one of the things we've got to realize is that as we have progressed

770
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,760
in the history of physics, we've had different kinds of measuring devices. There are things which

771
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,800
where they were presumably features of the universe all along, but we never knew they were there.

772
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:11,040
And I think that's kind of a, you know, that's the experience of, of saying, you know, so in

773
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:18,720
what sense is it even worth talking about a thing about the universe that we are completely unable

774
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:25,600
to perceive? Is that a, you know, you might still say, well, it's there, but we can't perceive it.

775
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:29,760
And so it's not something that's going to be part of the, the canon of our physics.

776
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:36,240
You know, it could be that there are, well, you know, gravitational waves, okay, that's a thing

777
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:42,720
that wasn't, you know, that, that was a long expected thing. But there could be, you know,

778
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:51,360
all kinds of, of strange phenomena, you know, that I could imagine, well, for example, in our

779
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:56,720
models of physics, there are dimension fluctuations. Our universe, we think of it as three dimensional,

780
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:00,960
but actually in our models of physics, it isn't exactly three dimensional, it has little dimension

781
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:07,760
fluctuations. And that's something that we are not currently, we don't have a good, I don't know

782
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:13,520
how we measure those, possibly they're related to gravity, possibly they're related to dark matter.

783
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:21,200
But, you know, once we get to the point where we suddenly realize, oh gosh, we can use this method

784
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:28,880
to take these dimension fluctuations and render them in a way that sort of connects to our minds,

785
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:33,360
then we've got a whole different set of things that we can talk about in terms of physics,

786
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:41,040
and a whole different set of things that we can kind of say are, you know, to discuss as, as physical

787
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:48,320
constructs. But I think it's a question of what, what is it that we can successfully perceive?

788
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:54,080
Those are the things about which we're going to have a, have a physics discussion. If we can't,

789
01:21:54,080 --> 01:22:04,480
if we're not perceiving it, we don't, you know, we don't discuss what we don't perceive. And there

790
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:09,920
might be, and you say, well, there might be things where there's a little, you know, there are a lot

791
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:14,400
of things which in the history of physics, for example, things about quantum mechanics, where we

792
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:20,160
just, physics went along for years without ever caring about any of that stuff, until there started

793
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:26,880
the experiments which rubbed our noses in those phenomena, and which came about, I think, because

794
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:32,240
of electronic amplifiers and things like that got invented, and that allowed us to amplify small

795
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:37,760
signals and we could start to detect things we haven't been able to detect before. But I mean,

796
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:50,560
you know, this, this question of, well, I mean, from a, it's sort of interesting as one, as one

797
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:55,840
starts to kind of, you know, one of the things that's always challenging is to live the paradigms

798
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:02,880
one invents. And, you know, I've, this is a thing which is, honestly, I think it's one of the more

799
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:08,800
challenging things. It's like, you know, as you have different generations of intellectual thinkers,

800
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:15,840
it's, you know, it's usually a couple generations later, the people kind of can really sort of,

801
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:22,640
you know, the paradigm is so obvious to them that you can sort of build on it. And I have to say that

802
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:30,720
the, the kind of the perception of, of sort of this, this, this idea of the Ruiad and the idea that

803
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:35,920
all that is real is our perception of, of, you know, our particular perception of it and so on,

804
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:41,840
the, I'm not sure that I've totally internalized that. I mean, just to talk a little bit about

805
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,960
personal history and the internalization of paradigms, it's, it is interesting to me that,

806
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:54,480
you know, in my life, at least many kinds of ideas, they take a couple of decades at least

807
01:23:55,120 --> 01:24:02,320
for one to internalize it. That is, you see a phenomenon, you know, the primary problem of

808
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:07,280
doing things like experimental science and Ruleology, just studying possible rules in the

809
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:12,960
computational universe is a kind of experimental science. The challenge of experimental science

810
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:20,720
is to discover things you didn't expect. Because too often, your, your paradigm for thinking about

811
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:27,680
things is, is one which makes you blind things that you don't expect. And in fact, this phenomenon

812
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:34,000
of complicated behavior from simple rules, people had observed that for at least 50 years, if not

813
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:40,720
longer, before the things that I did, but they just ignored it. They said, oh, we're studying early

814
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:46,720
neural nets and they sometimes they have noise and the noise is a nuisance. And we want to study,

815
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:52,560
you know, how do they behave like, like brains that make decisions or something. But, and it's

816
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:57,280
even the case, you know, when I was first studying these simple rules and their, and their consequence

817
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:04,880
is a number of very good mathematicians got involved in doing that. And they said, this is,

818
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,560
you know, we're going to be able to solve this, these are simple rules, we're going to be able to

819
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:13,760
crack this with mathematics. After a couple of years, they were like, no, we can't say anything,

820
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:21,360
we give up. Okay. And I suppose that the thing that, in a sense, I realized many years after the

821
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:27,200
fact is my main intellectual achievement at that moment was to realize the fact that one was giving

822
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:33,360
up was itself very interesting. I mean, the fact that there was a, you know, a paradigm that was

823
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:38,880
all about computational irritability and all these kinds of things that was orthogonal to the

824
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:44,480
mathematical paradigm, in some sense, or different from mathematical paradigm, that was in itself

825
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:49,280
very interesting. But it took, you know, I would say that a lot of these kind of,

826
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:58,480
you know, a lot of these ideas, they take a surprisingly long time for one to kind of internalize,

827
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:04,880
so to speak. I mean, in, and it's kind of the role in some sense of scientific history is to go back

828
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:09,440
and look, you know, because there are lots of things I can see from my own history where, you know,

829
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:16,800
for example, the fact that building this first computational language of mine was important

830
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:22,800
in the realization that you could build the physics from nothing, so to speak. It took me

831
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:27,360
several decades after that had happened before I realized that kind of intellectual connection.

832
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:35,680
And, but I think, you know, this question of, of what does it, if one now is thinking about the

833
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:42,960
world in terms of the Rulliard and perceptions of the Rulliard and so on, how does that make one

834
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:48,560
feel about one's experience of the world? And, you know, it's, it feels,

835
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:55,680
and I, you know, I'm at the early stages of understanding that. I mean, I think it kind of,

836
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:02,560
you know, I think it's sometimes easier to see the scientific consequences. I mean, there are,

837
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:11,120
there are broader consequences of things. I mean, like, for example, a, you know, if you look at

838
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:20,160
sort of a big arc of scientific history, there are, you know, one very dramatic moment inside

839
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:26,160
of history was sort of the whole Copernican Revolution story, which one can interpret as being,

840
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:31,520
you know, it's obvious, you know, before that time, it's like, you know, we're on the earth,

841
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:36,720
the earth is still, you know, is stationary, and we're looking at all these things moving

842
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:40,640
around the sky, and it's obvious that the earth is stationary. You know, how could it not be,

843
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:46,000
you know, that is a matter of our common experience. And then, you know, the surprise is,

844
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,440
you can make up a bunch of math that shows that the earth isn't stationary, so to speak.

845
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:57,760
And, you know, it's better to think about it as going around the sun. And then it's like, okay,

846
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:04,640
really, you've got to sort of switch off your common sense and say, the math is going to solve

847
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:10,880
the problem. It's going to be a, you know, it's a different way of getting access to what's going

848
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:17,680
on in the world. And I think that, and finally, after a few centuries, people got used to the idea

849
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:23,120
of so we can calculate stuff. And then people got to this belief that, you know,

850
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:27,680
then we can calculate everything, you know, we just, we run science a bit longer, and we can

851
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:32,080
figure out, you know, what's going to happen in this epidemic, or what's this or that, or the other,

852
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:38,800
you know, we can figure out everything just from, quote, science, science interpreted as

853
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:44,000
this kind of jump ahead, kind of, we can make a formula for what's going to happen.

854
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:52,560
I think the thing that, in a sense, if there is a broader significance to figuring out things

855
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:58,880
about fundamental physics, it's that, you know, in this picture, things are computational all the

856
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:05,600
way down. And so just as one is forced by sort of the whole Copernican story to say, there's a

857
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:10,080
certain amount that we just have to figure out with math, and we can't figure out from common

858
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:15,760
sense. So one is forced by the idea that everything is computational all the way down to say,

859
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:20,560
so the phenomena that happen in computation are ones that we have to confront. We can't say

860
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:25,120
everything we do, you know, yes, there is computational irreducibility in principle,

861
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:29,920
but it's not going to be important for for the things that, you know, for, but it's something

862
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:35,040
that's just out there, and not another thing that that will be relevant to what we're dealing with.

863
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:42,640
So, you know, I think that's some, yeah, but I mean, you're, you're asking the sort of question

864
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:50,720
about how does one feel about whether, whether sort of there's a, there's a, there's a thing

865
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:58,960
out there, and what is that thing? And one, you know, and I, I think this is more a question

866
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:04,080
of humanly coming to terms with what is essentially an intellectual structure,

867
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:09,520
than it is a question of, I mean, I think the intellectual structure is, is I like to think

868
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:15,280
reasonably clear at this point. Now, the question is, how does one come to terms with that intellectual

869
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:20,160
structure? It's just like saying, you know, at the Copernican time, and, you know, it's like,

870
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:25,360
there's an intellectual structure that was, you know, now, now we have to come to terms with,

871
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:32,320
you just calculate it with math, which is totally disorienting. If you're starting from the,

872
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:35,280
look, it's obvious that the earth is standing still, so to speak.

873
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:44,000
Well, talking about living with one's paradigms, another paradigm that you're very familiar with,

874
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,680
and that is notoriously difficult to live with is quantum mechanics. And I mean, it's, it's one

875
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:55,520
thing to accept that quantum field theory is so successful. And it's another thing to accept

876
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:00,960
or really live, I suppose, concepts like entanglement, just to take a common example. And

877
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:07,120
okay, there are so many fascinating ways in which the Ruliad connects to or derives more

878
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,960
explicitly interesting physics, like that of general relativity and black holes, like you

879
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:16,720
mentioned a little bit earlier, but to focus on one for a moment. I'm curious about how living

880
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:22,000
with these two paradigms, the Ruliad and quantum mechanics has been for you in that.

881
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:31,600
Does it, I'm wondering if accepting the Ruliad forces a specific interpretation of quantum

882
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:35,760
mechanics on you? Because as I take it, the Ruliad is deterministic.

883
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:45,600
Yes. So I mean, okay, you know, they, my old friend Dick Feynman was used to say

884
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,520
after spending his life studying quantum mechanics, one of his favorite quotes was,

885
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:56,720
nobody understands quantum mechanics. And, you know, I think I am inching towards the point

886
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:02,080
where I can say I actually understand quantum mechanics. I don't think I'm fully there yet,

887
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:09,280
but I'm, I'm, you know, at least inching towards it. And I think the, the sort of key observation

888
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:16,400
is this point about the many parts of history, and the fact that we, in our experience,

889
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:21,200
span those parts of history, span multiple parts of history, just like we don't cover the,

890
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:28,000
we don't fill the whole universe. We don't span all possible parts of history, but we span a,

891
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:34,960
a chunk of parts of history. And that's in a sense, when we say there's so, so, okay, so then

892
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:43,360
there's the, there's the question, okay, so that one of the issues is, why do we think

893
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:50,720
that definite things happen? If there are many parts of history, why, why aren't we just living

894
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:56,480
in a world where many different things are happening? And inside a quantum computer, I think

895
01:32:56,480 --> 01:33:00,640
that is what's happening. That's what, that's what a quantum computer, you know, inside the mind of a

896
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:06,160
quantum computer, it has many different things happening. The challenge with a quantum computer

897
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:10,480
and the challenge of what happens with quantum mechanics is somehow you have to take those

898
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:17,040
many parts of history and somehow aggregate them to something which is compatible with observers

899
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:23,040
like us, who believe that definite things happen. And so what is, it's like a measuring device.

900
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:28,400
It's like the, you know, the molecules hitting the piston. They, all those molecules are doing

901
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:33,440
different things, but the piston has one uniform kind of thing that it's doing. I think, in the

902
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:40,080
case of most kinds of quantum measurements, that it's more like a weighing balance. That is,

903
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:44,800
it's, you know, in the case of the piston, it's just aggregating real numbers and it's eventually,

904
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:50,240
you know, this is the average pressure type thing in a slightly different, but very similar kind of

905
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:54,880
measuring device is a weighing balance, where there are many different ways you can book grains of

906
01:33:54,880 --> 01:34:00,800
sand on the two sides of the balance. But in the end, it will go to sunk one direction or the other.

907
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:05,680
And I think that's similar to what's happening in the measuring devices that are used for measuring

908
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:10,960
things like qubits and so on, where there's sort of this binary decision about, was the spin-off

909
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:24,160
or down or whatever else. Now, you know, in, if you then ask, so what, you know, when you're

910
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:33,040
thinking about sort of the rules of quantum mechanics, and you're asking what, you know,

911
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:39,680
I think the underlying rules of quantum mechanics rather easily map on to this sort of underlying

912
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:44,320
dynamics of these multi-way systems and many parts of history and so on, that stuff is pretty

913
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:50,800
directly the path integral. The issue is, can we explain why it's a discretized version of that,

914
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:56,240
which is quite mathematically interesting, blah, blah, blah. But in the end, it's sort of unsurprising,

915
01:34:56,240 --> 01:35:02,320
because it's kind of just like the actualization in some sense of their mechanization of things

916
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:07,840
like the path integral. But then in traditional quantum mechanics, it's been kind of a hundred-year

917
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:12,880
wimp out, because it's been, it's basically, it's just like, and then there is this idea of measurement,

918
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:20,480
and we go from the quantum amplitudes to the measured results, and then something definite

919
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:26,800
happened. And we haven't had to describe, you know, the formalism of quantum mechanics as

920
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:31,360
mathematically tiptoed around this question of how does the measurement actually happen.

921
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:38,320
And in our models, there's much better chance to say, let's unpack what's inside the observer.

922
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:42,400
What is the observer doing? The observer is taking all these different things that can happen,

923
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:46,720
all these different threads of history, and they're equivalencing many different configurations,

924
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:52,240
and they're saying, so the spin was either up or it was down. And now we get to start unpacking

925
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:56,960
that and saying, well, what were the actual processes that caused that equivalencing to

926
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:02,480
happen? Just like in the case of the piston with the molecules and so on, what were the processes?

927
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:07,520
Well, every molecule that hits the piston causes the piston to deform a little bit. But, you know,

928
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:13,600
there are effectively sound waves in the piston that are exchanging momentum between the different

929
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:20,400
places where it gets hit. And it's a rigid thing. And so pretty quickly, it dissipates kind of the

930
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:24,400
little deformations that come from the individual molecules, and then you have a sort of collective

931
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:29,600
motion that occurs. And so similarly, and I haven't done this, and I've been wanting to do this,

932
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:35,200
is to really go through the sort of the details of how different quantum measurements are made

933
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:40,880
mechanically, you know, in the lab, what you actually do. And, you know, I've gone through

934
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,120
in qualitative terms, and I think you can kind of trace that it's a bunch of equivalences that

935
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:50,240
are being done. But then the question is, well, what can you say when you unpack this process of

936
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:55,360
measurement? What can you then say about quantum mechanics? What additional things can you say?

937
01:36:55,360 --> 01:37:00,800
For example, you know, will quantum computers work? Or is it the case that what you gain in having

938
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:06,240
these many parts of history and many sort of parallel threads of computation, you'll lose

939
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:11,120
by, but then you have to knit all these pieces together. And that takes a lot of effort. And I

940
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:17,600
think that's an example of where you get to kind of make a finer sort of a finer statement about

941
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:22,160
quantum mechanics. Now, you could ask, you know, do we understand why the born rule of quantum

942
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:27,520
mechanics works? Not completely. We have arguments about it. We have arguments for why it should

943
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:33,440
work. Have we dotted the i's and crossed the t's not yet? I am confident that that's going to work

944
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:39,840
out. But we don't, you know, we, it's just, you know, this is one of the challenges. You have a

945
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:45,280
very foundational theory. And you're trying to get to the point where you can say, go do this

946
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:49,520
experiment. I mean, there are lots of people who've said to us, you know, we have this giant

947
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:55,040
telescope. What should we look for? You know, what, what, what actual experiment should we do to look

948
01:37:55,040 --> 01:38:00,880
for, let's say, dimension fluctuations in the, in the, in the universe as it is, or, or look for

949
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:08,400
some other kinds of phenomena that our models predict. Problem is that actually going in and

950
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:14,880
nailing down kind of, you know, what the details of what the telescope should see are is a whole

951
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:21,040
bunch of work. And it's a big stack of kind of mathematical physics, and other things that

952
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:25,360
you need to go through. And computational irreducibility is not your friend, as far as the

953
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:31,760
stuff is concerned. And, you know, that is, we're slowly getting there. We now have nice

954
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:36,560
simulations of black hole mergers. We're starting to have simulations of quantum black holes and so

955
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:40,800
on. But it's a, you know, it's a, it's a whole bunch of work. And lots of people are getting

956
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:48,720
involved in that, which is nice. But, you know, when it comes to, so, you know, let's reproduce all,

957
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:56,480
okay, so I can say, in terms of, okay, so I mean, I think the fundamental point about

958
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:03,760
quote, understanding quantum mechanics is this idea about broad shield space, this idea that

959
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:09,920
quantum mechanics is, well, so for example, the fundamental law of quantum mechanics,

960
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:14,400
you could say it in different ways, but a nice way is in terms of the Feynman path integral.

961
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:21,760
And the path integral says that the ample sheet you get out is this, you know, you integrate

962
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:30,560
over all possible paths, and you take each path is weighted with e to the i times this quantity,

963
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:36,800
the action divided by h bar plants constant over 2i. So it's, it's a, it's a phase and e to the i

964
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:42,160
something or other. And the something or other is this action object, which is essentially an energy

965
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:50,320
density. And so the thing that's really cool is what, what what it's saying is the phase of the

966
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:58,560
quantum amplitude is determined by this energy density like thing. And the, well, okay, so in,

967
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:06,000
in physical space, the thing we know is that the paths particles take in physical space

968
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:11,520
are deflected by the presence of gravity, gravity, the source of gravity is energy,

969
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:17,760
energy momentum, mass energy momentum, whatever the whole same thing. The, so in other words,

970
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:27,360
a path taken in physical space is that path is determined by the presence of energy momentum.

971
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:34,800
It's, it's deflected by gravity. And so now we go to the same thing in Brown-Shield space in this

972
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:40,560
multiway graph and we're looking at and what turns out to be the case is that the paths in

973
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:47,360
Brown-Shield space basically are also deflected by the presence of energy. Energy in our models

974
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:52,560
is essentially the density of updates in this network. So paths in Brown-Shield space are

975
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:59,120
deflected by the presence of energy. And then I'm sort of skipping lots of pieces here, but, but,

976
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:06,160
but basically the, the current, our current belief is that position in physical space,

977
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:11,360
we understand what that is, that's kind of our common experience of position in physical space.

978
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:18,640
Position in Brown-Shield space, we're pretty sure corresponds to quantum phase. So saying that

979
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:23,600
the presence of energy momentum deflects paths in Brown-Shield space and so on is basically saying

980
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:29,600
the presence of energy momentum changes quantum phases, which is essentially what the path integral

981
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:37,280
is saying. And so the, the, the belief is that what in physical space is the Einstein equations

982
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:44,800
for space time and gravity and so on in Brown-Shield space, it's the exact same sort of underlying

983
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:53,360
process, but now it's the Feynman path integral instead. So this is, I mean, I mean, as a, from a

984
01:41:53,360 --> 01:42:00,000
pure sort of elegance in physics point of view, this is quite spectacular because it means, you

985
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,960
know, general relativity and quantum mechanics, people have wondered how do they fit together? Well,

986
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:09,280
the answer is they're the same theory, that they're the same theory played out in a slightly

987
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:13,760
different space. And by the way, there are already echoes of that in what's been done in

988
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:19,600
mathematical physics, the holography principles and the ADS CFT correspondence and so on between

989
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:25,120
sort of things in general, so do things in Brown-Shield theory. I think those are, those are kind

990
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:31,680
of echoes of the exact same phenomenon that there is that in some sense, these two theories are

991
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:36,880
really the same theory. And for us, there's this thing called the multiway causal graph,

992
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:43,120
which is the kind of the biggest, the big graph where one projection of it is physical space,

993
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:49,520
another projection of Brown-Shield space. So in a sense, this graph encodes both quantum mechanics

994
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:55,040
and general relativity, and you're projecting it in different ways to, to get sort of the experience

995
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:59,920
of different things. So that's, I mean, that's a, but let me give you one more, one more kind of

996
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:04,640
picture of sort of how quantum mechanics tries to work. So one of the things that's

997
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:09,920
always confusing in quantum mechanics is things like destructive interference. So, you know,

998
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:13,920
you have two slits, you have, you know, the photon can go through one slit or it can go

999
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:18,400
through the other slit, but you say, well, it can go through either one or the other.

1000
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:23,920
So, you know, by the time you're looking in the center of the, the screen behind these things,

1001
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:27,120
it's, you know, there's got to be something there because after all, it could have gone through

1002
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:30,800
once that it could have gone through the other slit, but how can you end up with nothing there?

1003
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:35,360
How can you end up with destructive interference of the probability of that, that a, that a,

1004
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:42,400
that a photon gets there? Okay. So here's what I think happens. And I think it's bizarrely similar

1005
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:47,200
to a phenomenon in mathematics, actually. Let me, let me explain, let me actually explain

1006
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:53,680
the phenomenon in mathematics first. Sure. So in, you know, my picture of mathematics is

1007
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:58,240
the mathematician is, has a bag and they're collecting theorems that they think are true

1008
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:04,400
and putting them in this bag. The, the, the mathematician with a finite mind only can have

1009
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:10,720
a finite bag of theorems that they kind of coherently think are true. But now imagine that

1010
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:17,360
you put a false theorem in there. Well, now in sort of from the middle ages, people have said,

1011
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:22,000
you know, material implication, if you have a false premise, you can derive everything.

1012
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:28,240
This is this kind of idea of, you know, principle of explosion or whatever, that once you, you know,

1013
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:34,240
if you were seeing a false hood, then the, you know, then you can derive any possible,

1014
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:38,160
any possible result. So what happens to the mathematician when they put a false theorem

1015
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:42,480
in their bag? The answer is that false theorem entails all possible theorems.

1016
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:49,120
So that bag explodes. And so they, the, the, you know, so that their mind explodes in some sense,

1017
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:55,680
they can't, they can't maintain all these things together. So, so that's kind of the, that's sort

1018
01:44:55,680 --> 01:45:02,960
of, so now let's look at the quantum mechanics case. So now what I think happens is that the two

1019
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:08,080
photons, they go to slightly different places in physical space, but in Braunschild space,

1020
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:14,160
these two photons that both could end up at the center of the screen are at kind of opposite ends

1021
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:22,160
of Braunschild space. And so the, the observer who is bounded in Braunschild space is trying very

1022
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:27,600
hard to say, well, what happened? You know, I could imagine both photons were there, but to

1023
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:32,560
imagine that I would have to expand my mind in Braunschild space. In fact, I would probably

1024
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:39,840
have to expand it in some idealized way, infinitely. And so just like the mathematician can't put that

1025
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:47,200
false hood into their bag, so similarly, the observer of these two photons can't conclude

1026
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:52,560
that they just can't make consistent the picture that the photon went through either one thing or

1027
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:57,360
the other. And so they have to say, didn't, you know, the photon just disappeared, so to speak.

1028
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:01,920
That's, that's my, but you know, there are, there are lots of, you know, all these different

1029
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:08,160
phenomena of quantum mechanics, you can start to have, I think, almost intuitive kinds of,

1030
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:14,400
you know, kinds of views of what's going on there. I think it's, I mean, to mention one

1031
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:19,200
from relativity that I think is very lovely. And by the way, there's an analogy in mathematics here

1032
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:25,120
as well, time dilation and relativity. So, you know, if you are an observer who's going faster,

1033
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:31,840
time to, to an observer, you know, the time appears to be progressing more slowly to an

1034
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:38,000
observer who's going, going faster, the phenomenon of time dilation. So in our models, you have a

1035
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:44,240
thing, it's represented by some sort of tangle in this network. And the thing is moving in this

1036
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:50,480
network. Well, the process of motion requires a certain amount of computation. You've got a thing

1037
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:55,280
in one place, it's got to reconstruct itself in another place, that takes a certain amount of

1038
01:46:55,280 --> 01:47:01,280
computation. But the progression through time also takes a certain amount of computation.

1039
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:08,400
And the thing has a certain computation budget, so to speak, that is ultimately determined by the,

1040
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:13,520
the fundamental processing power of the universe, you know, that's sort of the, the way of measuring

1041
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:20,320
distances in the ruler. And so this, this, what you end up with is you can either use your

1042
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:27,920
computational effort to sort of progress through time, or you can use it to rewrite your position

1043
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:32,800
in space. But as soon as you're rewriting your position in space, you're using up some of that

1044
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:40,080
budget. And so you don't get to evolve as quickly in time. And so you, you have to, you know, it's a,

1045
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:44,400
that that's, that's why that's sort of the mechanical reason that time dilation happens.

1046
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:53,680
So in the case of metamathematics, well, okay, let's see, there's, there's sort of a similar

1047
01:47:53,680 --> 01:48:01,440
phenomenon that has to do with, if you were investigating something in one theory, using

1048
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:06,320
another theory, like algebra and geometry, you were, you were, you're trying to use algebra,

1049
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:12,240
but you're studying geometry. And you're kind of going back and forth between algebra and geometry.

1050
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:19,520
There's this translation cost that let's see how does this work. The, I mean, but basically the

1051
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:26,720
time dilation phenomenon comes about because as you are trying to sort of think about geometry

1052
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:36,000
in terms of algebra, let's say, you are necessarily incurring some, you're slowing down your progress

1053
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,000
in geometry, because you keep on having to do this translation back and forth to algebra.

1054
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:46,800
And that's a, that's, I'm not untangle all the pieces to this quite right. But, but that,

1055
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:51,200
I think there's a phenomenon there that is similar to time dilation, which is very weird.

1056
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:58,080
And, and by the way, these, these correspondences speak to sort of, you know, help convince me

1057
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:02,480
that this picture that's sort of underneath both mathematics and physics is the same rule

1058
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:06,800
here. The fact that there are these correspondences makes that encouraging. I mean, another, other

1059
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:12,640
correspondences that what is a black hole in mathematics, a black hole, I think is a decidable

1060
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:20,640
theory. So just as in, you know, in physics, there can be unbounded time. So in mathematics,

1061
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:25,360
there can be unbounded proofs. But by the time you have a decidable theory, the proofs are going

1062
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:32,880
to be bounded. And so that's like a decidable theory is like a black hole. And then, then you

1063
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:37,520
have an physical space, you have all these singularity theorems that say when you have too

1064
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:43,920
high a density of energy momentum, you inevitably form a black hole. In mathematics, the statement

1065
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:49,120
would be when you have too high a density of proofs, you inevitably end up with a decidable

1066
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:55,920
theory. And so this leads to very bizarre things, like for example, the future of the universe may

1067
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:01,440
consist of a bunch of black holes, the future of mathematics may consist of a bunch of decidable

1068
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:07,840
theories. And in other words, that the, that the sort of inexorable future of the universe

1069
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:12,720
sort of is similar to the future of mathematics, so to speak. Another thing corresponding to

1070
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:20,080
mathematics and physics is homogeneity in the physical world. That is, that we can move around,

1071
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:25,120
you know, we believe that physics is kind of the same here as it is in the Andromeda galaxy.

1072
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:31,840
In mathematics, the statement would be mathematics is kind of the same in the algebra place as it

1073
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:38,080
is in the geometry place. So in other words, there is a, an inevitable translation from one field of

1074
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:44,160
mathematics to another. If the mathematical universe is reasonably homogeneous, which I think I can

1075
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:49,760
argue that it is, then it is necessarily the case that there will be these correspondences between

1076
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:54,560
these very different areas of mathematics. And we see some evidence of this of all these kind of

1077
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:59,840
dualities between different areas of mathematics and so on. But it's sort of interesting to see that

1078
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:05,920
homogeneity in physical space, the analogy to that is the presence of these things. And I think,

1079
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:13,360
by the way, in a recent thing that I've sort of come to, to imagine is that category theory,

1080
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:19,520
for example, which is one example of a kind of a broad sort of structural sort of description of

1081
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:26,480
lots of areas of mathematics. Category theory is a, is a characterization of a, so one feature

1082
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:32,640
of category theory is you say, oh, we apply this morphism, then we apply this morphism. And category

1083
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:37,680
theory says if you can apply this morphism, then that morphism, then there's always a morphism that

1084
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:44,320
just jumps all the way. That's, that's just an axiom of category theory. That axiom can kind of

1085
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:49,440
denies computational irreducibility. Because if each of those morphisms was a computational

1086
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:56,640
irreducible step, then to say, oh, but there's just a supermorphism that jumps all the way is to

1087
01:51:56,640 --> 01:52:01,840
kind of say, but we're, you know, that there shouldn't be that supermorphism if you had to go

1088
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:09,760
through all these computational irreducible steps. And so I think that that's, in a sense,

1089
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:16,160
category theory is a, is a description of computationally reducible sort of, is a,

1090
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:20,880
is that some kind of meta description of computationally reducible pieces of mathematics.

1091
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:27,040
And, but it's, it's one of these things that I think is, is, you know, somehow there's a

1092
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:31,680
correspondence between that and this thinking about sort of homogeneity in mathematical space.

1093
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:40,080
Time does fly. And this was terrific. Thank you so much again for talking with me. And hopefully

1094
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:45,520
our third round comes closer than the, to the second than the second did to the first. Thanks again.

1095
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:54,480
Yeah, it was, it was great. Good stuff.
