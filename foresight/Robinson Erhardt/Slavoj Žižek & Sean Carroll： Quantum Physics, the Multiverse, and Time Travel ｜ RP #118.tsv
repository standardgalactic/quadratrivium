0	4880	Many words interpretation simply multiplies realities.
4880	12160	We lose a special everything is true in the sense of all possible variations are true.
12160	22240	So what I and in some sense what fascinates me the ontological incompleteness again disappears.
22240	28240	Everything is fully there. The problem is our limited standpoint.
29200	32000	Am I missing something here?
32000	37760	Yeah, so I'm happy about this one because you are missing something and I can I can help a little bit where I like you.
37760	38880	Yeah, yeah.
38880	49760	Hello, Maggie Slings. It is Mother Goose, Robinson Earhart, here with the podcast and the introduction to Robinson's podcast number 118,
50080	57920	which incidentally confirms that we are on a very strange branch of the wave function because my guests are
57920	64400	Slavoj Žižek and Sean Carroll and I will keep their bios short since everyone knows them.
64400	70400	But Slavoj is International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London
70400	75360	and a senior researcher at the University of Ljubljana's Department of Philosophy.
75360	88640	He was also the guest on episode 109, which was all about psychoanalysis, wokeness, racism, sexism, Nazis,
89360	97360	curb your enthusiasm and 100 other things. It would be impossible to encapsulate all of the topics that we cover without
97760	102640	talking for the talking for 90 minutes, the length of our episode.
102640	109760	But Sean Carroll, on the other hand, is actually a quantum physicist. He is a cosmologist, a philosopher.
109760	119920	He's a homeward professor of natural philosophy at Johns Hopkins University and fractal faculty at the Santa Fe Institute.
119920	126000	He's also host of Sean Carroll's Minescape, which is an absolutely terrific show. I love it.
126000	133520	I've listened to every episode on science, society, philosophy, culture, arts, ideas,
133520	139440	and anything else Sean has been thinking about. But Sean, along with David Albert of Columbia,
139440	145120	was a guest on episode 106, which covered the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics in great detail.
145120	154800	And then we also talked about entropy and the enduringly fascinating topic of Boltzmann brains and then the fine-tuned universe.
154800	164880	But in this episode, I am, as Slavoj refers to me, merely the middleman and a wallflower along with pins.
165600	172880	And so I don't do much of the talking. So Sean and Slavoj, while I giggle in the background,
172880	181280	do talk about quantum mechanics, the indeterminacy of small scale reality, cosmology and the Big Bang,
181280	189200	some major figures like Niels Bohr, Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and then the world of sci-fi,
189200	194560	including movies like everything, everywhere, all at once, Indiana Jones and the Avengers.
194560	201760	And now one thing that I really have to mention, so pay attention now, is that Sean Carroll is an
201760	208160	honorary fellow of the John Bell Institute for the Foundations of Physics, which is directed by
208160	216480	another Robinson's podcast alumnus, and that is Tim Modlin of NYU. It's, at this point,
216480	224480	still very much a nascent organization trying to secure its home. And it is meant to give a home to
224480	230960	many of the topics that we discussed today and really has the who's who in the foundations of physics
230960	237280	as contributors. And the JBI can really use any donations at this point in their early history.
237280	243360	I've donated once and will certainly donate again as soon as my meager budget allows it.
243920	249840	So anything you contribute will be greatly appreciated by the JBI. And finally, there are
249840	255840	links to Sean's website, Sean's Twitter, and the biggest ideas in the universe in the description.
255840	263840	So without any further ado, I hope you enjoy this wide-ranging conversation as much as I
263840	270240	didn't so much have it, but got to enjoy listening to it as it happened myself.
280480	287120	Slavoj, you're very well known for thinking about a lot of topics and Marxism, psychoanalysis,
287120	292960	and Hegel come to mind, but quantum physics isn't one of them. So just to get us started,
293920	298960	when did Q.M. and the various quantum theories catch your philosophical interest to the point
298960	302800	that you've been concertedly writing and thinking about it a lot more lately?
304640	315840	My, it's quite a series of topics. The first one is my philosophical obsession. I've written
315840	322800	about it repeatedly and so on. And Sean, this is already to provoke you interrupt me at any point.
323440	332240	What absolutely fascinates me in quantum physics is, again, maybe it's already wrong,
332240	340400	I will say, this idea of to put it in philosophical terms, ontological incompleteness.
341520	348960	For example, the point is not we cannot measure, at the same time, position and movement.
349600	356960	That's for me not radical enough. It still means the particle has a measure in the position, we
356960	364080	just can't, movement and position, we just can't measure it. But what if in more radical reading,
365040	373600	reality is in itself ontologically incomplete? The point is not that if you analyze reality to the
373680	381680	end, you will get a complete, a complete description with everything at its place and so on and so
381680	393600	on. And as far as I can see, now you will ask me, how does this link with my philosophy? Because
393600	406080	it's a very unorthodox reading. In my reading, even of Shegel, the final result is not you get
406080	415440	the whole truth. The final result is that what you thought was just an epistemological obstacle,
415440	422800	like we cannot get it all, just one aspect of the other. The final result is when you realize that
422800	430480	what appeared to you as a limitation of your knowledge is, defines already the reality itself.
431520	440480	Reality is in itself incomplete. Now I follow debates and I know the problems with this. If she
440480	450640	known in the United States, she being Sabine Hosenfelder, the German one, her idea is, I'm sure
450640	458480	you know a thousand times better than me, is a super big feminism. And basically,
459600	465600	her idea is, if I follow it correctly, on Einstein's line, she had variables and so on,
465600	475280	we just don't know it all. Where I see an interesting point that she makes is, and now comes
475280	488480	Sean, my first question to you. Some physicists, one to which who I spoke, not as highly graded as you,
489120	499200	insisted that all this focus on not the agent, what triggers the so-called collapse of the wave
499280	507280	function, that is a secondary, unimportant problem, that you can even, this is the radical
507280	517520	tendency, if I got it correctly, that you can define collapse even in an objective way. What
517520	527680	comes to my mind are so-called decoherence theories, or another version is a quantity that as soon as
527680	535360	the object is no longer at the subparticle level, but becomes part of our reality,
536000	545280	automatically decoherence happens. Now, this brings me to another point, I hope we will
545280	552560	have time later to approach it, which is time and space. Do you agree, because I was informed that
552560	560960	this is also one of your topics? Is it true or not that this hidden variable's Einstein view
561600	568960	is more focused on space as a more primary dimension? Didn't Einstein even at some point
568960	578800	propose the theory that what we perceive as time, time movement, is really just moving along a certain
579760	586000	spatial line and so on? On the other hand, there are many others, and for obvious reasons, it's
586000	596960	closer to me, who claim that time is more radical, primordial, but let's begin with this, with what
596960	604160	I told you. All this problem, and I know that- I think so, yeah. Collapse of wave function,
604160	611760	observer, registration, when does it happen? Because I find all different versions, up to the
611760	618560	cosmological one, that it's God himself, who is the ultimate observer, no reality without God,
619520	628480	and to this more modest version, whatever, okay, teach me, where I'm totally losing my mind,
628480	635200	and tell me at least the state of the things today. I think this is very good, because the time and
635200	641280	space questions that you're raising are very, very good, but they come later, so the quantum mechanics
641280	647120	collapse of the wave function questions come first, and to me, it's extremely embarrassing,
647120	653680	but true, that physicists don't know what to think about exactly the questions that you are raising.
653680	659200	So let me just quickly run through some of the options, because there are sensible people who
659200	662640	believe all of them. You know, the fundamental fact that we're trying to
663920	671520	accommodate ourselves to is that we have a way of describing the world that is super duper successful
671520	677280	with what we call a wave function, the quantum state, the Schrodinger equation, all this mathematical
677280	683120	apparatus, but then when we look at it, when we measure it, when we perceive it or experience it,
683120	691040	we don't see that wave function. We see a position or a momentum, some observable quantity,
691040	694720	and this is completely... Which is absolutely not reality, what we see always.
695360	700880	Well, we... Yes, I don't want to prejudice by deciding what's ordinary reality yet, but we see
700880	707600	things, and the things we see, I think what you're getting at is they do remind us of what we thought
707600	712480	the universe was back in the days of classical mechanics. Newton would have said that there is
712480	717920	a position, there is a velocity, now we say, well, we observe those, but that's not how we discuss
717920	722640	what's really going on. So I can quickly run through at least three options that are very
722640	730960	much on the table. There is a very conservative way of going where you say there really are
730960	737600	positions and velocities, those are real things, and there is also something called the wave function,
737600	742560	and it's a whole big complicated mess, and that is the hidden variables approach that,
742560	748640	like you say, Einstein would have liked. There are still people who follow that, mostly in the
748640	754080	context of what is called Bohmian mechanics. You have both a wave function and articles.
754080	761440	That's what I wanted to say. How could these pilot waves... Isn't this still...
762240	769360	There are the substantial entity particles or whatever, and you just accompany them as a
769360	775680	capable aura with wave functions, you know? You know, I have to be honest, I'm not sympathetic
775680	782560	to this point of view, so I have trouble defending it. For purely philosophical reasons, I'm not
782560	790480	sympathetic, but let me now directly move to the third degree, but my KGB file on you
791440	798560	tells me that you are sympathetic to many worlds. Reading. That's going to be the third of the three
798560	804800	options I give you. Sorry, sorry, go on. Yes, sorry. Yes, one is hidden variables, just like you said.
804800	810320	The second is more or less what you were pointing to yourself at the beginning there, which is the
810320	817360	most radical one, which is essentially to deny the existence of reality, or at least to deny the
817360	824480	existence of something that is mathematically precise and that pre-exists our observations,
825040	832560	to make this incredibly radical move that says that we can calculate the probability of what our
832560	838000	observations will be, and we can then make them, and when we see them they're real,
838000	843760	but there was no such thing as what they were before we observed them. There was only this
843760	849920	instrumentalist kind of calculation, and weirdly, even though that is clearly the most radical and
849920	856720	hard to really wrap your brain around, that's the one that came first. That's the more or less
856720	862400	what Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg would have advocated, you know, a completely epistemic
862400	868560	instrumental approach to thinking about quantum mechanics. Whereas the third option I would give
868560	876160	you is a happy medium, where you say there's the wave function, and that's it. There is nothing else,
876160	881840	and the wave function does not collapse, and there are no extra variables, and the Schrodinger
881840	887200	equation, which tells you how the wave function evolves, is always true, just like Newton's laws
887200	893600	were always true in classical mechanics. And the crucially important thing to make that viable
894240	899440	is because when we look at things, like I said, we don't see the wave function, so if it's what is
899440	906720	real, why don't we see it? And the answer is that we have a wave function ourselves, and we have
906720	913840	superpositions of who we are, and they all exist, but the we that does the observing and the
913840	920240	experiencing is only a tiny, tiny fraction of what is going on in the whole wave function,
920240	928320	so we call this many worlds. And it is on the one hand the most simple and straightforward working
928320	932720	version of quantum mechanics. On the other hand, it makes you a little bit dizzy to think that all
932720	938560	these different worlds are coming into being. And I would put super determinism and Sabina's
938560	944960	theories, which come from other people also, as a fourth category, which is even wackier
944960	947840	than the ones that I've told you about, but we can talk about them if you want.
947840	954720	Yeah. Thanks very much. Listen to me. Okay. My first story to go on in this police
954720	965440	style, my problem is the standard reproach that I hear and read about many worlds is that
966400	975280	it's one cannot even imagine how to test it with today's knowledge. That it's just an empty
975280	984800	hypothesis. It resolves such many paradoxes, blah, blah. But with today's knowledge, we cannot get a
984800	994400	clear test. Good. That's wrong. But you do hear it a lot. Yeah. Please. Go on. I'm sorry. It depends
994480	999440	on what you mean by test and we have to get very carefully into the philosophy of science here,
999440	1009200	right? For two reasons. If what you mean by test is just the very naive falsifiability kind of
1009200	1014320	idea that Karl Popper would have put forward, right? Can you rule out the theory by doing some
1014320	1020720	experiment? Then the answer is clearly and straightforwardly yes, because the theory just
1020720	1025680	says that there is a wave function and all it ever does is obey this particular equation.
1026240	1031520	So if you ever see the wave function not obeying that equation, you have ruled out the theory. You
1031520	1037200	have falsified it. And there are I didn't mention, but there are other versions of quantum mechanics
1037200	1045280	that predict exactly that in a very quantitative and testable way. So far, what we call the objective
1045360	1051520	collapse of the wave function has not been observed in experiment. But as soon as we do
1051520	1057120	observe it, if that ever happens, we will rule out many worlds. Sorry to interrupt,
1057120	1063680	but when you say has not been observed, so you don't buy this simplistic materialist,
1063680	1070000	I also don't buy it version, which says that no problem collects happens all the time in
1070000	1076400	reality and so on. And you try to define registration or decoherence in a totally
1076400	1083280	objective way. You don't buy this. Well, I am super duper materialist. But I think that the
1083280	1088080	only thing the wave function ever does is obey the Schrodinger equation. It does not collapse
1088080	1094800	all by itself. So the alternatives, there are there's sort of sub degrees within this materialist,
1094800	1100720	physicalist camp. People like me think it's the Schrodinger equation from start to finish.
1100720	1106000	And what we perceive as collapses are only apparent, because we're not seeing the whole
1106000	1111440	story. There are other people like Roger Penrose or others who think that the wave function
1111440	1117760	violates the Schrodinger equation by suddenly collapsing on itself. I think it's very, very
1117840	1124880	difficult to actually define a theory that works along those lines, but it does have the
1124880	1129680	nice quality that it's very, very testable, and it's very, very different in its predictions
1129680	1135760	from what many worlds is. Okay, now there's the other- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please. I will
1135760	1140160	discipline myself. Finish, please. There's the other even more subtle philosophy of science
1140160	1146560	question, which is, okay, but what about many worlds versus the Copenhagen interpretation or
1146560	1152400	Bohmian mechanics or something like that? And these are all very tricky, worthwhile asking
1152400	1160320	questions. My answer is the following. The problem with Copenhagen versus many worlds is that Copenhagen
1160320	1166800	is not a theory. It is not precise. It does not tell you when wave functions collapse,
1166800	1173200	what a measurement is, what qualifies as a measuring apparatus. It's not that I can't test
1173280	1180640	it. It doesn't even tell me what the predictions are or what the ontology is. So if you're comparing
1180640	1185280	many worlds to Copenhagen, it's not a fair fight because one theory is well-defined and the other
1185280	1191600	one isn't. It is true that as far as I know, they have no difference in terms of experimental
1191600	1197840	predictions, but they have huge differences in terms of being well-defined. Whereas with
1198400	1204160	pi-the-wave theories, Bohmian mechanics, hidden variable theories, those are well-defined.
1205040	1211680	I would like to be able to distinguish many worlds from them. I have a deep suspicion that
1211680	1218320	they are experimentally distinguishable, but nobody has actually pinpointed what that difference is.
1218320	1222960	So that is, to me, an open question. I think that there's a lot of Bohmians who think that
1222960	1227440	their predictions are exactly the same as many worlds. I suspect they've not just been trying
1227440	1235200	hard enough. Okay, now I will try to be more precise. I agree with you. There isn't even one
1236880	1243120	about Niels Bohr. There is even one very vicious, but I like vicious,
1243120	1250720	formulation's point that it repeats almost that the basic formula of Copenhagen interpretation is
1250720	1261280	don't think just calculate. Don't even ask these questions. Okay, let me go step by step. My
1261280	1270960	problem with many worlds is that the way you put it, I would love this. The only wave oscillations
1270960	1277680	collapse is something that appears, blah blah blah, but isn't in some sense, although
1278640	1284400	when I say in some sense, I don't mean it in a precise scientific sense, but it seems to me that
1286880	1294160	many worlds interpretation simply multiplies realities. We lose a special, everything is true
1294880	1302080	in the sense of all possible variations are true. So what I, and in some sense,
1302800	1310880	what fascinates me, the ontological incompleteness, again disappears. Everything is fully there.
1310880	1318080	The problem is our limited standpoint. Am I missing something here?
1319120	1323680	Yeah, so I'm happy about this one because you are missing something and I can, I can, I can help a
1323680	1329920	little bit. I like you. Yeah, yeah. So two, again, two points worth making. One is that
1330000	1338560	it is certainly not true that within many worlds, every possibility exists. It's very easy to
1338560	1344080	to point to possible worlds that don't come into existence. What, what many world says after all is
1344080	1350160	that we obey the Schrodinger equation. And that implies a lot. For example, electric charge is
1350160	1357120	conserved. I can imagine a world where a proton spontaneously turns into an electron. There is
1357120	1361920	no such world in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. There are many, many
1361920	1369120	imaginable worlds that just don't come to be. The second issue, which is much more subtle and
1369120	1374800	worth, you know, you're allowed to disagree with many worlds on this one is many worlds not only
1374800	1382800	says here's the bunch of worlds. It says that the worlds don't count equally. That there is a weight
1382800	1388480	or a thickness to them. And that helps explain why in quantum mechanics,
1388480	1392640	you predict there's a probability for X or a probability for Y, but the probability for X
1392640	1400320	is 99%. And the probability for Y is 1%. And that's a crucially important part of many worlds
1400320	1405440	that you don't necessarily get if you're just thinking about David Lewis and possible worlds
1405440	1411040	or something like that, right? Many worlds on defies how big the worlds are. And that's crucially
1411040	1418160	important. But now I would like my police instinct to gain kind comes into action.
1418720	1426640	When you say how big worlds are, is this ontological category in the sense that some
1426640	1434000	worlds are sorry to use this term, you can explode in some sense more substantially real
1434000	1442560	than others? Or can you specify a little bit more, this idea of more and less,
1442560	1450720	whichever way you name it, big or strong worlds? Well, you know, and I do say the
1450720	1455600	following thing often and always makes me feel bad. But this is something where if we write down
1455600	1462480	the equations, it's crystal clear. In words, it's hard. But the answer is that it's not that one
1462480	1468560	world is more real than another. They're both real. Let's let's get take the 99% versus 1%
1468560	1475680	example. They're both real. But the way it works out is if you don't know the outcome of the
1475680	1480000	experiment, so you do the experiment, you make the observation and you haven't looked yet.
1480640	1490000	So maybe you're in the 99% world, maybe you're in the 1% world, right? The impact of this
1490000	1496240	calculation, which is completely quantitative, is that you should assign a credence of 0.99
1496240	1502000	to being in the 99% world and a credence of 0.01 to being in the 1% world.
1502000	1506000	So they're both real, but you're not equally likely to find yourself in them.
1507040	1514800	What I still don't get and sorry, I, although I'm totally opposed like you to that
1514800	1522560	hidden variables in the sense of there is one single substantial reality, that's what I still
1522560	1536160	don't get here. Okay, Schrodinger equation said 99% blah blah. Then I agree with you because of our
1536160	1546000	limited standpoint, something happens. Why insist that parallel or I don't like the word
1546000	1556560	parallel is too physical, that at the same time, another reality exists, alternate. What do you,
1556560	1563680	what do you gain by this? Nobody wants this to be the case. Nobody is insisting that both
1563680	1569120	worlds are there. That is the prediction of the Schrodinger equation. And the question is,
1569120	1576000	you can either accept it, like I think of what Hugh Everett did as more therapeutic. He was a
1576000	1582800	joclican of physics. He wasn't writing down new equations. He was just saying, here are the equations,
1582800	1590880	here are their implications, you have to deal with it. Or you can modify the theory, you can do
1590880	1596800	violence to the Schrodinger equation to get rid of the other world if that makes you feel better.
1597680	1601360	And you're welcome to try to do that. That's basically what the hidden variables people
1601360	1606560	are trying to do. They're trying to invent a finger that points to one world and says,
1606560	1610960	here's the one we're actually in. The others are there, but there's only one that we're actually
1610960	1615840	in. That's why David Deutsch, for example, says that hidden variable peoples are just
1615840	1620480	many world's people in denial, because they know the other worlds are there, they don't want to
1620480	1629920	live in that. I like the Hegel formulations, because back to, okay, back to the opposite vision,
1629920	1639760	back to Niels Bohr. I was surprised at how, at some level, he is ultra commonsense,
1639760	1647360	really. Doesn't he repeatedly say, all that we can observe, all that exists out there is our
1647360	1654320	common reality. Everything that we measure, it shows on the screen, we're measuring apparatus in
1654320	1661760	our common reality. So, he insists that all these wave function formulas and so on, they have no
1661760	1669040	ontological status in the sense that we have to presuppose another type of reality.
1669120	1676240	He insists that it's simply, and here he escapes, I think, too easily into some kind of
1676880	1683360	naive epistemological reason. He says, these are just our mathematical means, formulas, or sometimes
1683360	1692320	he even says language symbolic fictions to account for how did we come from A to B, but both A and
1692320	1703200	B are firmly here. So, does he ever try to make a step further? I know I will be very precise here,
1703200	1708880	I'm not, I'm laughing, but not substantially, because what would then in this view prove,
1709920	1717440	I, of course, follow this with fascination, the, these years you remember the three guys,
1718400	1726160	the old French one, Alain Aspect, and the Zeilinger, an Austrian man, and the third one is American,
1726160	1735920	I think, or whatever, no. What did they really prove? Isn't, nonetheless, in what they say,
1736560	1744320	a little bit more realist tendency, that in some sense, there must be a level of
1744880	1753760	reality, which work reality, whatever you call it out there, that works in a different way from our
1753760	1763680	ordinary reality. Another thing, usually what they did is, with these experiments, is usually read as
1764400	1774480	Bol's victory against Einstein. But isn't it more complex, because they didn't prove that there is no,
1776240	1783680	that there is pure contingency, no. They only proved that if you go to Particle A, this then the
1783680	1791440	correlated Particle B down up, but this only means that there is no link at the level of speed of
1791520	1798640	light or lower. There still can be a link at the higher level, higher, okay, outside, no?
1799760	1805840	Exactly, that's exactly right. Bohr has his, you know, I don't read a lot of Niels Bohr,
1805840	1811600	he's famously hard to understand, but he has his modern avatars, right, there are people alive right
1811600	1818880	now, who very much think that reality does not pre-exist our measurement outcomes. And as you
1818880	1824240	imply, Einstein, as well as Schrodinger for that matter, were very much on the other side. They
1824240	1831040	were very much physicalists, materialists, they wanted to see the mechanisms behind what was
1831040	1838160	going on before we made our observations. The problem that they had, as you're pointing to, is that
1838160	1845760	they had a, you know, Einstein invented relativity. He thought that spacetime was very fundamental
1845760	1852560	and the speed of light was absolute. So what he pointed out in the famous EPR paper, Einstein,
1852560	1859440	Podolsky and Rosen, is that quantum mechanics, but maybe the audience doesn't, so I'm trying to be
1859440	1868560	careful. You know, quantum mechanics seems, he said, to be incomplete with any kind of underlying
1868560	1874640	theory that would take locality seriously, the idea that not only is there space and time,
1874640	1881360	but things that exist have locations in space and time and things that interact
1881360	1886640	do so at the same point of space and time. And Einstein says quantum mechanics seems to be
1886640	1894880	incompatible with that. And John Bell proved a theorem saying, yes, it truly is incompatible
1894880	1901920	with that. And then the people who measured their correlated photons, their entangled photons,
1902000	1911200	Ospey, Klauser and Zeilinger, verified that Bell was correct, that you cannot reproduce the
1911200	1918640	predictions that we observe in the real world with any naively locally realist theory.
1918640	1922400	But only locally, no? Only locally. It must be locally.
1922400	1928560	Only locally, exactly. So even the, amusingly, even the Nobel Committee got this wrong in their
1928560	1933520	press release. They said that these experiments ruled out hidden variable theories, but that's
1933520	1938960	just false. They ruled out local hidden variable theories. Because this was my first reaction.
1938960	1944240	Sorry, it doesn't rule out all hidden variables, just those operating locally.
1945520	1953600	In fact, just to, you know, make the story more amusing, John Bell was motivated by the fact that
1953600	1958960	David Bohm had written down a non-local hidden variable theory that was very successful. And
1958960	1965120	Bell really liked Bohm's theory, and he asked himself, is it, you know, Bohm's theory is clearly
1965120	1971520	manifestly non-local? Is that a necessary quality, or can we get rid of it? And what you proved is,
1971520	1974640	you cannot get rid of it. It's necessary if you want to match the data.
1975200	1986400	But again, here, first, sorry, let me return for a brief moment to Neil's board. I hope we
1986400	1992800	are both here on the materialist side in the sense that what I worry is not so much this
1993360	2001120	direct new age spiritual reappropriation if I were to be a ruler of a Stalinist empire.
2001120	2007360	If you say, as I read somewhere, some Indian idiot, not Native American, India said,
2007360	2013360	oh, but all the Xilinger and those guys proved is not we Indians know from Upanishads, from
2013360	2019280	Bhagavad, you know all that bullshit. Even the movie, I haven't seen it, but it didn't prevent me to
2019280	2026080	write the review of it. Oppenheimer goes into this, you know, all those voting Bhagavad Gita,
2026080	2034000	and the destroyer of the world, whatever. So even, even the board was not clear here.
2034000	2041200	When he, when he, what's his principle? Sorry, I'm so confused now of
2042560	2052320	complementarity, yeah? He had this tendency to falsely universalize it in a pseudo-spiritualist
2052320	2059760	way. For example, he said, it's not just particles, it's also, he said, to the Bible,
2059760	2066720	then, then wisdom versus knowledge and all that bullshit and so on. So this is where we need,
2066720	2074160	we materialists, intellectual police, no? We need some agency to say the moment you mention this,
2074160	2079200	do you know what I give you here, one-way ticket, first class to Bulak for 10 years,
2079600	2086800	no, but seriously, isn't this, that's why also quantum, why quantum physics interests me,
2086800	2094640	because precisely because it breaks the confines of our ordinary notion of reality,
2095360	2102880	it is always exposed to this pseudo-spiritualist danger. So my,
2103280	2112800	my problem here is, I read this and I learn also from people like you that,
2113360	2120960	that golden era of Copenhagen shut up, daunting, calculate is over. We are returning to what
2121520	2129440	traditionally is called ontological, metaphysical questions. My temptation is, and please tell
2129520	2138960	me from what you know, am I totally wrong or not? If I, you know what vacillates me in this
2138960	2149120	Bell's theorem, no? What if this element of maybe even contingency is not the right term, just this
2150480	2157840	openness, not full determinism and so on, are we back with many worlds in
2158480	2165920	determinism or do, is this openness of the universe maintained? Wonderful idea for me that
2165920	2172800	you know, even if you look at details, details, no, it's not. You discover deep at some point,
2172800	2179200	reality is blank, open. I would like as a philosopher for non-scientific interest to
2179200	2185200	save this, hit me. I mean, with counter. I think that two things, you know, your, your,
2185200	2192720	your characterization of Bohr is right on. Not only was his philosophy of quantum mechanics
2192720	2198560	a little bit fuzzy, with not defining what he meant by measurement and whatever, but he did,
2198560	2208240	you know, unabashedly connected to ideas from ancient eastern wisdom and complementarity.
2208240	2211920	And you were doing this, I thought you were trying to only come in him. Even eastern wisdom,
2211920	2216800	he was already dead. Oh, yes. Oh, my God. He was. And not to anyone's benefit.
2216800	2223520	But out of police when we take power. Right. But the determinism question is a much trickier one,
2223520	2228400	because then, I mean, just so everyone knows in the background here, so, you know, quantum
2228400	2232880	mechanics came on the scene in the 1920s and 30s with the Copenhagen interpretation and whatever.
2233840	2241760	It was in the 1950s that people like Bohm and Everett finally wrote down 100% physical
2241840	2247600	material versions of quantum mechanics that fit the data completely well. The physics community
2248400	2253680	could not care less. They just ignored it. They go on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you care about this,
2253680	2258000	you're not going to get a job. You'll be kicked out of the field. But we know. You can't now say.
2258000	2263600	Bohm also a political one. He was very left leaning with. That's right. He was kicked out of the
2263600	2268000	country, not only of the field. Ever left the field by himself. But he picked out a few different
2268000	2274320	reasons. Yeah. Not because of quantum mechanics. No, no, because of his point. Yeah. But, you know,
2274320	2281840	yeah, so there's there and there are still people today who will, who will be, are you in favor
2281840	2288960	of idealism on the basis of quantum mechanics that we have to put consciousness. Sorry.
2288960	2293760	It should be. Isn't sorry for Roger Penrose approaching death a little bit.
2294400	2298480	Maybe a little bit. A little bit. But at least, yeah. But I think, you know, there are some people
2298480	2304000	who will simply deny the existence of objective reality and put mind and agents at the center of
2304000	2308960	everything. That's one thing. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe that's right. Maybe it's wrong. But my point is,
2308960	2314800	quantum mechanics doesn't force you in that direction. There's perfectly mechanistic versions
2314880	2323760	that fit the data perfectly well. But so, so again, your answer to this mega reproach from Einstein,
2323760	2332000	Janssen, Savine, Rosenfelder, and so on, that quantum mechanics describes, it's very simple
2332000	2338880	reproach. I just repeated for the viewers, describes a certain universe, which is in itself
2338960	2347520	consistent wave function, blah, blah. But it cannot account in its own terms of the,
2348400	2355760	our ordinary reality measuring, and so on, and so on. In, if I read you correctly,
2356480	2362880	many worlds does this in some sense. Yes. Yeah, exactly. So I think, you know, I forgot, you
2362880	2369520	also mentioned determinism, which is a crucial point here, which again, physicists don't agree on.
2369520	2376800	So for both hidden variable theories, boom, by the waves, etc., and for many worlds, you're in a
2376800	2385040	situation where the underlying equations and dynamics are 100% deterministic. Laplace would
2385040	2390240	have been happy. Laplace's demon could predict everything that happens. But in both theories,
2390240	2396240	there is some epistemic uncertainty. There is some subjective probability that comes in.
2396240	2400000	In the case of hidden variables, it's because you don't know where the hidden variables are.
2400800	2404720	In the case of many worlds, it's because all these different branches exist, and you don't
2404720	2412320	know which branch you are on. So there's the appearance of indeterminism, because you cannot,
2412320	2417360	even if you know the wave function of the universe perfectly, you still can't predict the outcomes
2417360	2422480	of your next experiment. So it's a weird in-between ground. You know what I would like to do? Now,
2422480	2433200	this is a pure abstract, in a bad sense, philosopher speaking through me now. I would just like to
2433200	2442000	elevate into, as you may have guessed, into ontological status to put into reality itself
2442000	2448320	this element of uncertainty. Can't we say, while keeping sure the equation and so on that,
2448320	2455840	and that's for me the mega greatness of quantum physics, that there is an element of uncertainty
2456720	2464320	which is not just epistemological, but which is in itself. Isn't this also implied in what you said,
2464320	2474400	99%, 1%, it's not that we don't know. It's in reality itself, in some sense, because it's
2474400	2484880	99%, 1%, and so on. You don't like this idea. Yeah, I am honestly, I know that you told me to just
2484880	2490000	say the truth and not say that I'm not sure about my opinions being true or false. This is a good area
2490000	2497440	where it's okay to be a little uncertain. I would say that in the many worlds point of view,
2498480	2506720	we're faced with a novel, unique metaphysical challenge, because like I said, we can know
2506720	2512560	everything about the universe and still not make a prediction. And the reason why is because
2512640	2519440	that 99% world and the 1% world are both going to become true. And there will be a
2520400	2527680	future version of me in each of those worlds. And there's no unique, it's not even sensible to ask
2527680	2532480	which one of them am I going to be. They're both going to be in there in existence. They're both
2532480	2538160	going to have all of my memories, right? This is utterly unprecedented in physics or philosophy.
2538160	2544320	So I claim that the way to distinguish it is to say that both of those future selves are real
2544320	2550080	people, but they're in positions of self locating uncertainty, indexical uncertainty. There's
2550080	2555600	something they don't know, which is where they are in the universe, which branch of the wave
2555600	2564000	function they're on. And it's perfectly deterministic, underlying dynamics, but a new situation in
2564000	2569440	which there's no univalent you that can ask questions about the universe. There's many
2569440	2578160	different future versions of you. This nonetheless reminds me of problems that emerge even with
2578160	2586240	Descartes, Kogito in modern philosophy, where here I see the actuality of Descartes. Yes,
2586320	2593840	universe is mechanistic and so on, but I cannot locate myself into it deterministically.
2594720	2601600	This is the big enigma, I think, in some sense of the entire modern philosophy.
2604000	2609520	I recently did a podcast with Robinson, with David Albert, who is another very well-accomplished
2609520	2615040	philosopher of science. And we talked about the fact that there is an analogous situation
2615120	2619920	that also comes up with the multiverse, not the many worlds of quantum mechanics, but the
2619920	2624960	cosmological multiverse, where we imagine that just very, very far away, there's many different
2624960	2630880	observers and so forth. And philosophy is just not currently up to the task of dealing with this,
2630880	2637440	I think. It needs to get better, but how do you evaluate questions like,
2638160	2644000	what would a typical observer see in this ensemble? And should I care about that question,
2644000	2649440	because I am not a typical observer. Should I reason as if I were typical? Cosmologists
2649440	2655200	bless their hearts. They think the right thing to do is to reason as if they were a typical
2655200	2660640	observer in the universe, even though they know perfectly well that they're not. So they go through
2660640	2665760	this weird thing where they say, okay, I'm going to forget everything I know about my actual situation.
2666320	2670640	I'm going to pretend I was a typical observer. I'm going to make predictions. I'm going to open
2670640	2676640	my eyes and go, oh, this is very surprising. But we can do better than that and we don't do yet.
2677600	2682400	But you see, now we don't have time to go into it, but this is another
2682400	2690400	metaphysical topic that fascinates me. Why? And often, for me, deterministic philosophers get
2690400	2697360	caught into this. You want to be as realistic as possible, but to formulate your position,
2697360	2703760	you have to pause at an impossible point of subjectivity, where you see an all-universal
2703760	2710400	observer and so on and so on. What tempts me, but I don't have, of course, not a scientific
2710400	2721920	formula here, is, but okay, let's return to many worlds. But you think that, but doesn't
2722000	2729760	Schrodinger equation, equation, just give probabilities from what will happen now,
2729760	2734720	like 99% this happens, okay, everything happens. I got your point.
2736080	2741520	Yeah, so not everything happens, but something's happened and something's happened more than others.
2741520	2747440	So, you know, I think that this is the challenge, because if you're a many worlds person,
2747440	2751360	you do think that the Schrodinger equation is all there is. And let me back up just a second
2751360	2756640	to make it even a little bit more reasonable. If you believe in quantum mechanics at all,
2757680	2765680	and you want to be realist at all, right, so then you will have to say that the electron
2765680	2770720	that can be spinning clockwise or spinning counterclockwise, quantum mechanics says it
2770720	2777040	could be in a superposition, right? It truly is some combination of spinning clockwise and
2777040	2782320	spinning counterclockwise. And so if you believe that that can be physically true, not just a
2782320	2787840	state of our knowledge or prediction, then you should be able to believe that the whole universe
2787840	2794320	can be in a superposition of many different possibilities. So you're not asking for anything
2794320	2800480	more by becoming a many worlds person, all the possibilities were always there in the
2801440	2808320	quantum mechanics. All of the new challenges are philosophical. How do I deal with the fact
2808320	2813360	that there are many people like me with exactly the same epistemic states? How do I make predictions
2813360	2817440	of what they're going to see when they open their eyes and things like that? It is a radically
2817440	2823040	different view of the world, maybe not as radical as the view that says that there is no reality,
2823040	2826880	but still pretty darn radical. And I think the quantum mechanics forces us to be radical one
2826880	2837840	way or another. I see, I see. Okay, let me move it connect. You know what fascinates me? Now I move
2837840	2848080	into my own speculations about philosophy language and so on. I like so much the notion of superposition
2848880	2854720	because I think I will try to put it in very simple terms, but it's a more complex theory.
2855040	2863600	A guy who teaches French guy who I think, is he Stanford or Santa Cruz? Did you hear the name
2863600	2869680	Jean Pierre Dupuis, D-U-P-U-Y, a French theory. A very familiar but not an expert, yes.
2873760	2882080	Tried to introduce, but without any bluffing about quantum physics, the notion of superposition
2882640	2892320	into historical processes and knowledges. I will give you an extremely simplified example.
2893440	2900880	Let's say today we are in an, I will go even specifically, Russia put in Ukraine war.
2902400	2910080	Again, maybe it's already decided in the terms of the Schrodinger equation 99%, but we don't
2910080	2917680	know what, that there will be global war or not. But his idea is this one. And again, this is pure
2918320	2927440	speculation, more pertaining to human language. Is that in our human, human universe, I'm here
2927440	2933760	often referred maybe to that famous quote from T.S. Eliot, who was an idealist conservative, but
2933760	2944080	others, he put it nicely that every new invention, really new in art, in some sense also changes the
2944080	2951760	entire past. It makes it readable in a different way. So Dupuis interpretation against these lines
2951760	2961360	would be, let's say that in two, three years, there will be world war three. Then automatically,
2961360	2968560	we will retroactively read it as it was clear all the time that this should happen. We just
2968560	2977360	had illusions that we can avoid it. Let's say that world war three will not happen. Then we will
2977360	2986080	have the way we read today, the Cold War. No, yes, it was danger, but somehow we avoided it and so
2986080	2993440	on and so on. But Dupuis point that I like is that it's not enough to say that these were just
2993440	3002320	different possibilities, options. It's a stronger term. It's in the sense that if something happens,
3002960	3011280	it, of course, it doesn't restructure the past in its brutal reality. But the whole symbolic
3011280	3017680	constellation of how we read the past page. And this now I could go on here for hours. I love
3017680	3024960	these examples. That's why I am not, and I think in my crazy way, I got this lesson from one of
3024960	3037440	these mechanics. I am not, I totally reject this stupid historicist view to understand Shakespeare.
3037440	3046640	You must study in detail Elizabethan era and so on. I would say first the opposite. To understand
3046640	3056400	Elizabethan era rejects, you will learn more. But more seriously, you know, for me, really great works
3056400	3065760	of art are precisely the ones which cannot be limited to a specific historical constellation.
3066240	3073440	Every new epoch reinvents them. For example, with Shakespeare. Many people don't know, but immediately
3073440	3080560	after his death, it was the horrible era of Racine and all those strange guys, classicists, and
3080560	3086560	Shakespeare was considered vulgar. Only through romanticism, Shakespeare was reinvented. And I
3086560	3098000	love these paradoxes. How sometimes precisely not knowing all the context of Shakespeare historical,
3098000	3105760	you can propose a reading which is much more convincing. And it's not simply an external
3105760	3111520	reading. Again, I'm back to my point about openness. It is as if, which is obvious,
3112320	3118560	Shakespeare didn't really know what he is doing. You know, which is here my wonderful example. You
3118560	3124960	know that it's attributed to Lincoln, but I read somewhere that he was not really the first to
3124960	3129600	say that, you know, you can treat some of the people all the time, all the people
3130720	3137120	sometime, but you cannot treat all the people all of the time. This is a deeply ambiguous statement.
3137200	3146080	It can mean there are some idiots who can be treated all the time, some the same, or it can mean
3146080	3152640	in one situation, I will be the idiot in another situation, you or you. You see, this is for me
3152640	3160960	how language is structured. It is open. The author himself is not a possessor of some hidden meaning.
3160960	3167600	That's why my favorite example is, you know, where Shakespeare, for me, the best cinema version
3167600	3177520	of Shakespeare Hamlet is Kurosawa in 62 in Japan, did a version of Hamlet with a wonderful title,
3177520	3184240	Only Evil People Sleep Good, which is a deep truth, you know, real evil people don't care. They
3184560	3191680	they're not haunted. And again, it's set in modern Japan, Hamlet is a student returns to
3191680	3198240	Tokyo from United. But what I'm saying is you see what I'm aiming at. This I or I'll give you
3198240	3205200	another classical example. I remember from the Puy this quote, you are too young, call to be some
3205200	3213520	23 years ago, there was a presidential candidate in France, Edouard Balladur, who say, but when
3213520	3222240	there were some pre-elections in Le Monde, there was a wonderful comment saying, if Balladur will
3222240	3230640	win next election, his victory will be necessary. You know the paradox, after something happens,
3230640	3240880	it becomes retroactively necessary. And now you see where I am aiming at. I'm desperately looking,
3241680	3247680	but you almost converted me, I will have to work more in quantum physics for some kind of
3248400	3259280	ontological foundation of this openness that I like this idea of retroactive determinism. And I
3259280	3264240	will give you the ultimate social proof. This is not physics at all. But I love it.
3264880	3272960	A protestantism. People don't notice this obvious paradox. Weber, protestant, ethics,
3272960	3280160	origin of capitalism, blah, blah. But since if anything, capitalism is a system which
3280160	3286800	pushes you to constant effort and so on, isn't it strange that you would have then expected
3287440	3294960	that capitalism, sorry, protestantism would have been against, and this brings me back to your
3294960	3300560	point in a very nice way, that capitalism would have been against predetermination. Because if
3300560	3306080	everything is predetermined, why not my seat at home must await and watch Pornhub or whatever.
3306080	3316560	It's already decided. But precisely capitalism, which is the most active system, needs predestination.
3316640	3323120	Along what lines, along what you said, here I come back to you, here I will use you,
3323120	3330320	when you said wonderfully, yes, setting an equation objectively valid, but with one small
3330320	3337120	point, I don't know where I am in it. And that's protestantism in religion. You see now what I am
3337120	3344000	aiming at, you know. But nonetheless, you know, let's go to the end in
3344880	3354400	metaphysics. I see your point. But then what would be your answer to where
3355440	3362800	does then our limitation, now I'm going back to you, there is an objective description,
3362800	3367920	we can give it, we just don't know where we are. You don't think that
3368880	3378720	how can, how can many words interpretation account for this uniqueness of us?
3380080	3389520	Not uniqueness in any metaphysical sense, but how we are one unique, but still can arrive at this
3389520	3397680	objective, as it were, view of this. So let me say two things. For me, how do you account for the
3397680	3402240	subject itself? Him sense himself, I will not go into this bullshit now.
3404000	3407600	So I'm happy we can solve these questions so easily in this podcast. It'll be very,
3407600	3415200	very valuable to future generations. I'll say two things, one a little bit negative and one more
3415200	3423920	constructive that the negative thing is, I am reluctant to think about quantum mechanics when
3423920	3429680	I think about the uncertainty of human history, because there is a difference between quantum
3429680	3437920	mechanics and probability or stochasticness, right? There's plenty of room for unpredictability
3437920	3442560	in the world. In addition to what quantum mechanics gives us, what's special about
3442560	3449040	quantum mechanics is that there's not just the probability, the probability is derived from
3449040	3455360	this thing called the wave function, which distinguishes the idea that there's two possibilities,
3455360	3461200	but we don't know which one is true, from the idea that there's really both possibilities
3461200	3467040	at once. And I think that at least when it comes to human subjectivity and history,
3467120	3472880	you don't need to imagine that all the possibilities are simultaneously physically true.
3472880	3478720	You can just work with the fact that there's so much uncertainty and, excuse me,
3478720	3487920	unpredictability in the real world, that we need a language of probability and computation and
3487920	3494560	information to really make progress on these things. And it might involve the past in an
3494560	3501120	intricate way. In fact, I'll reveal, I'll mention two funny things. One is, I recently did a podcast
3501120	3506160	with Katie Elliott, who's a philosopher, and she made very much a similar point that you're
3506160	3512720	making about Protestantism. We were talking about predestination and eternalism, and she said that
3512720	3518240	she can make eternalism. She convinced herself that Calvinism was okay.
3519200	3524560	I know, but this is the latest theory. It's no longer Luther, it's Calvinism, which is elevated.
3526480	3531120	The problem with Calvinism is you're either blessed and going to go to heaven or you're not.
3531680	3538320	But you never know. But you never know. So the worry, she points out, is very well known,
3538320	3544240	is that, well, I can just act bad because I'm predestined to go to heaven or not. But what
3544320	3549600	you don't understand is that God knows that you're going to act bad. And so if you act bad,
3549600	3554560	you're bringing to reality the possibility that you're not going to go to heaven. So even though
3554560	3559760	it is predestined, because you don't know, it is still in your best interest to act good.
3560960	3563280	I know this thing, I forgot his name.
3564240	3574640	My God, I forgot his name. Protestant, I'll put it back, whatever. Theodist, theologist,
3574640	3581680	who is also known as the one who uses analytic philosophy. And he precisely in the terms of
3581680	3588320	beyond the speed of light, he defended Protestantism because he said exactly what you said now.
3589280	3597760	Like, if I'm predestined, why should I act good and so on? But again, God is beyond time.
3597760	3602160	God knows how you will decide. Exactly. No, that's why it's...
3602160	3606960	It's like Newcombe's paradox. That's how we got into it. Yes, if you believe that there are
3606960	3612480	oracles that know about the future, you will behave differently than if you don't. But anyway,
3612480	3617920	the other thing I wanted to say, I wrote a short piece, a short essay that I published on my blog
3618000	3623760	years ago called, I hope you'll be amused by this, the universe is structured like a language.
3625200	3629920	So somehow for me, I am universe, not unconscious, but universe.
3629920	3634320	Not the unconscious. The universe is structured like a language. So I quote you and I quote
3634320	3640400	some quantum physicists. And the basic idea is that the universe evolves from
3640480	3650800	a very orderly, low entropy early state to very disorderly, messy future state. Along the way,
3651680	3655840	complex structures appear. This is the kind of thing that at the Santa Fe Institute,
3655840	3661040	we're very interested in understanding. And the implication is that there...
3662320	3667040	Somewhere there in the laws of physics, in the laws of dynamics, in the way that we think about
3667040	3672800	how the universe marches forward, there exists the potential, the potentiality for
3673680	3679200	interesting complex things to happen. And even though they were not sort of embedded intrinsically
3679200	3684720	in the initial conditions, they came to be because of the structure of the dynamics along the way.
3684720	3691440	And maybe quantum mechanics does play a role in that. This is all stuff that nobody claims to
3691440	3700720	understand very, very well. But if there's something computational or useful about complex
3700720	3704880	structures coming into existence, then that would be very nice to understand. And by the way,
3704880	3711520	by complex structures, I include you and me. Why did living beings come into existence,
3711520	3716400	even though the second law of thermodynamics says that the universe just rolls down to more
3716400	3723200	and more disorder? And the suggested answer is that the way that you get to more and more disorder
3723200	3729440	is to pass through intricate, complicated things. And you can't predict very well which one they're
3729440	3737360	going to be. Can I now bombard you with my last big meta-physical point? Since I was told and you
3737360	3746720	indicated you also do cosmology and so on. Okay, to cut it thought directly to the thing.
3746720	3753600	Is Big Bang theory out or not? Because I hear again and again that you can get that. I'm sorry.
3753600	3762160	Traces of something that must have gone off before Big Bang and so on, all that stuff. So the idea is
3762160	3768240	almost a kind of Stalinist dialectical materialist visual of repeated Big Bang here,
3768800	3776000	collapses here, explodes there. Where do you stand here? So the sad thing is that the phrase
3776000	3783920	the Big Bang theory refers to two very different ideas at the same time. One is the whole history
3784640	3791040	of the universe from t equals zero to today, where it started hot and dense and it rapidly
3791040	3797520	expanded and galaxies and stars coalesced out of it. And the whole bit, the universe is approximately
3797520	3804640	14 billion years old, all of that. That story is just 100% solid. It's not going away. There was
3804640	3810400	just this week excitement on Twitter because someone claimed it was completely wrong, but they were
3810400	3816720	completely, they were themselves completely wrong. What can I tell you? There's so much evidence in
3816720	3822000	favor of this general picture, 14 billion years, et cetera, that we don't need to worry about that
3822000	3827920	being overturned by future experiments. Nobody wants to do this. They just claimed that there
3827920	3832720	must have been something other Big Bangs before. They don't say there is no Big Bang.
3833840	3838480	Well, sadly, no, there are people who still think that even the story I just told you is wrong,
3838480	3843600	but then they're sadly misguided people. I'm just letting you know that you can find some
3843600	3848160	crazy claims that the universe is 30 billion years old or infinitely older. There's still people out
3848160	3854560	there who say those things. 6,000 also last Thursday. Yeah, these are all on the table.
3854560	3859520	But now the harder question is that sometimes we use the phrase the Big Bang to refer to
3860080	3866160	just the moment t equals zero, right? Just the first moment. Forget about what happened after that,
3866160	3871760	but the actual event. Lots of nature, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's right. Now there,
3871840	3878320	the only honest thing we can say is we have no idea what happened. Physics is not up to the task
3878320	3884240	of saying whether there was truly a singularity, whether that was truly the beginning of the universe,
3884240	3890640	whether it was a bounce or a quantum nucleation event. All the options are on the table. I'm
3890640	3896080	responsible for some of the options. There's a picture. This picture right here is one of my
3896080	3902480	favorite theories where the universe is infinitely old. So I think that the idea that the Big Bang
3902480	3908480	that we talk about is not the beginning is absolutely viable, but we have no way of knowing
3908480	3916800	whether it's true or not right now. Now, can I, so you don't agree with those? I read some reports
3916800	3927200	on it that if we analyze these early stages, Big Bang, blah, blah, we can find in it
3927200	3934400	immanently traces of something that must have happened before. You don't think this is necessary?
3934400	3940000	I don't think so. I know that people have pursued that possibility and Penrose is one of them,
3940000	3945840	and I'm very, very glad they are pursuing the possibility, but I think that the data so far
3946480	3952960	as well as the theoretical predictions are that anything interesting gets wiped out in the interim
3952960	3957680	in that period since the Big Bang, everything was just smooth and featureless. I would love
3957680	3962880	to be wrong about that, and I hope I am, but I wouldn't buy any existing claims along those lines.
3964480	3971760	But another thing that bothers me, not bothers me, it is that I hope we are here on the same
3971760	3977680	materialist side. You must have known, everybody quotes it, a dialogue, I even don't know, did it
3977680	3985360	really happen or not? Stephen Hawking was at some conference with the Pope and the Polish reactionary
3985360	3994880	guy told him, here we have no misunderstanding, Mr. Scientist, your topic is Big Bang and after
3994880	4004960	our topic is before, you know, I don't buy the story. I think this, sir, within the space of
4004960	4012240	science for an opening where somehow religion or another dimension enters, I hope we agree,
4012240	4020000	this is absolutely wrong perspective, this desperate attempts, you know, to, to, to,
4020320	4025200	completely wrong. I mean, I don't think that religion is very informative for anything interesting. I
4025200	4030880	think that it's, it's plays a hugely important historic and cultural role that I respect very
4030880	4035600	much. But when I want to think about why the universe exists or where it came from, I'm going
4035600	4040160	to think about science and philosophy. I'm not going to think about religion. In fact, I think
4040160	4045840	that your Hawking story is true. And it's a reflection, there was a previous story, you know,
4046480	4051440	lot of the development in early days in the thirties and forties of the Big Bang model
4051440	4058800	was by George Lemetra, who was a Belgian priest. And the Pope put him on some commission to, you
4058800	4065520	know, science and religion. And the Pope at the time, who I think was pious, said, well, this
4065520	4070320	Big Bang theory is great. It proves that Genesis was right. It proves that the universe had a
4070320	4077040	beginning. And Lemetra said, no, no, no, no, do not, do not say that. Because if you started
4077040	4081440	saying, well, we've proven religion right by science, tomorrow, science is going to change
4081440	4084800	its mind. And you don't want to say, oh, well, we were wrong about religion.
4085360	4091200	You know, this may interest you. I always admire, but I despise them. Don't be afraid.
4091200	4096560	Some fundamentalists, I had along these lines, a very interesting debate,
4097120	4104720	some time ago with the Catholic friend, who was at least honest. You remember that mystery of
4104720	4111600	the Turin Shroud, you know, are those are those stains there, Christ blood. And you know what
4111600	4121600	confidentially this highly placed bishop told me, she prays to God every evening that this is not
4121600	4128720	really Christ's blood. You know what, how he reasoned. If this is somehow we prove it, what
4128720	4135760	don't ask me how Christ's blood, then the first question is, let's analyze DNA. And what we will
4135760	4143600	get there, probably now an extremely brutal, that Christ was the result of, of Virgin Mary
4143600	4150880	screwing with some servant there. But it's better not to know. But some American fundamentalists
4150880	4159680	had a crazy answer. God doesn't have a DNA. So we will just get the double DNA of Virgin Mary
4160320	4168800	herself. You know, so this is for me the most dangerous temptation. This naive fundamentalist,
4168800	4176560	which even lack this, what I find in authentic religion is this radical openness. For example,
4176560	4183680	great guys, the one who was loved by by Nils Bohr Kirkegaard, he said, I'm not sure that I believe,
4183680	4189600	I only maybe believe that I believe. And I think the moment you go into fundamentalism,
4190320	4196080	you are lost. You are lost in the sense that you put, but so the final point,
4196320	4208480	you know why I like so much this quantum physics against this Einsteinian view,
4208480	4217440	because it's usually, and I think they're idiots. I hope we agree here generally, usually people claim
4218480	4224000	Einstein was more a materialist, objective reality and so on while Bohr
4224320	4233360	opened up the path for all this stuff. But I believe that it's almost the opposite, that
4235120	4239360	Einstein is interesting. You know, his famous
4241840	4248880	retort to Nils Bohr. God doesn't play dice. And then he even says that I don't believe in personal
4248880	4257920	God, but there is a divine dimension in this eternal cosmic order, the beauty of loss of
4257920	4265520	nature and so on and so on. And we all know Bohr, here I bow my head to him, gave a perfect answer.
4265520	4277280	Don't tell God what to do. What I like here is that I think that if not in the sense of any fully
4277280	4288320	religious sense, but in a sense of a belief in a firm order of our reality, this is for me
4289200	4297360	the most basic, even today I would call it not theological dimension, but this belief in what
4297360	4304000	in my Lacanians were gone, I call the big other. Even if we don't know it, there is a cosmic order
4304000	4315280	and so on. But you know that here, I think that one tool mechanics opens up a path to a much more
4315280	4321360	radical materialism. And I put it, maybe you know the story in this way. And I was so glad
4321360	4328960	narcissistically. Two, three months ago, I watched on Austrian TV and interviewed the Austrian guy,
4328960	4340880	Salinger, the one of the three. And the interviewer lady asked him, literally mentioning my name,
4341600	4348800	that what about my idea that quantum, this old joke that I like to repeat, you probably know it,
4348800	4357200	that quantum physics demonstrates that God is an imperfect lazy idiot, that God was too lazy to
4357200	4365520	determine things to the end. And we, as it were, went too far. And he said that there is a lot,
4365520	4372720	at least in Europe, a lot standing joke about this, that quantum physics is one big proof that
4372720	4381360	God is lazy. He didn't want to do all the work, you know, and that now, so I think this is my big
4381360	4388880	effort. We have, we are on the same line here, I think, how to read quantum mechanics in a strict
4388880	4396320	materialist way, how to get rid of all this, you know, quantum mechanics means, you know,
4396320	4403200	the whole syllogism is horrible. Quantum mechanics means only observer brings possibilities to
4403200	4409920	reality, A, the universe really exists, B, so there must be a mega observer who is,
4411760	4418480	who is God. But still, let's maybe slowly and at the same time, conclude with some, so I will
4418480	4425440	have to think a lot more, because I'm still Boda, and I will quote you simply by your final
4425440	4434160	formula, which is this wonderful one of many world's interpretation, we can describe the world
4434160	4443440	perfectly, we just don't know where we are in it. My goal, I obviously don't know enough of size, is
4444000	4451920	to somehow in a totally, not in an idealist way, this means a reality just to have an observer,
4451920	4461040	but in a truly materialist way to somehow find a crack inconsistency in reality, which is not
4461040	4467440	subject, but which opens up the space for subtlety, in what sense, let me conclude before I confuse
4467440	4475680	you, because we here come at the point of freedom, I read Penrose, who likes to, he's one of those
4475680	4484320	who think that you can ground human freedom in quantum phenomena, but I think that even if you
4484320	4493760	accept a radical uncertainty, openness, this is not freedom, freedom is not as intelligent people
4493760	4500880	want to call it, and freedom is not contingency, freedom is a different sort of determinism,
4500880	4508240	I do that because I decided so and so on, so this quick link, and it's very popular among
4508240	4514640	chief philosophers today, oh but doesn't already quantum physics open up the space for freedom,
4514640	4521520	it's, do you agree it's wrong, it's totally, I completely agree that that is wrong, but I will
4521520	4526240	mention something that I've been thinking about only recently, in fact maybe in the last hour you've
4526240	4533440	helped me clarify it, but there is a role for quantum mechanics, literally quantum mechanics,
4533440	4539200	not just metaphorically, in accounting for the richness of the world that we see around us in
4539200	4545200	the following sense, what if classical mechanics were true, right, what if there was no wave
4545200	4551280	function, everything was perfectly deterministic, you could be Laplace's demon, so you could know
4551280	4555280	the complete state of the world today, and that would predict the state of the world in the future
4555280	4561520	in the past, if that's true, then all the richness around us, including you and me,
4561520	4567760	Robinson having this discussion, was inherent in the initial condition of the universe, right,
4567760	4574880	but no, I would play your role before, it depends how you define the work inherent,
4576640	4581440	you can also read, yes it does, but I have a definition, stability, blah blah, not fully
4581440	4587840	deterministic, you know, sorry, go on. What I'm imagining is if classical mechanics
4587840	4593600	had been true, then you could take our universe now, you could use the laws of physics to evolve
4593600	4599040	it to the early time, and it would look smooth and, you know, featureless, but only because
4599040	4605840	there were very, very, very subtle correlations there, that you could then evolve backward,
4606480	4611200	back forward to the present day, like we were implicit, let's put it that way,
4611200	4617040	in the initial conditions of the universe, but when you have quantum mechanics, now that's not
4617040	4625040	true anymore, the early universe can be truly simple and featureless, and what happens is,
4625040	4632400	as these branches happen and decoherence happens, then individual parts of the universe can begin
4632400	4638320	to look complex, and you can't predict exactly where you're going to be, because like we said,
4638320	4642320	there's many different futures, and you're going to be in all of them, and there's different versions
4642320	4647760	of you that will be in all of them, but the sort of, the action of quantum mechanics is to start
4647760	4655040	from a simple, beautiful, pristine state, and create many, many, many very complicated, very
4655040	4660960	interesting world. Now I will try to strike back with a precise metaphysical question, you said
4660960	4668160	at the beginning in a much more complex way, but some basic, simple, whatever you call it,
4668160	4676960	simplicity, but wouldn't it, if we were to be able, I'm returning to your idea of this
4676960	4683440	ideal observer, which would have seen the entire picture, all the possibilities, wouldn't that
4683440	4691520	also involve some kind of return to simplicity, I'm not saying that it is a simplistic image,
4691520	4698560	it's very complex, I know all the options and so on, but in a way it would have been a flat well,
4698560	4703360	like everything is, well I think this is good, there's a very good point, but I think it's the
4703360	4710560	difference between hardware and software, right, an observer like Laplace's demon who could know
4710560	4718800	everything and do all the calculations is a very simple concept, not that complicated, but the data,
4719520	4724160	the software that that person would need to actually do the calculation correspond,
4724160	4730320	where universe would be incredibly complicated, whereas in quantum mechanics, Stephen Hawking
4730320	4735040	and Jim Hartle wrote it down, the way function of the universe, and all of the complexity can just
4735040	4738720	come about universe by universe, world by world, afterward.
4739760	4746640	No, no, I see, I see, yes, oh my god, there are so many, okay, sorry, I'm
4746640	4755120	slowly getting tired, but there are so many points here, now I see where I will have to
4755840	4764480	rethink my position, I will, can you, this precise idea that you mentioned, now you can
4765200	4770320	you can even use the middleman, exclude this or what, but I would love to have,
4771440	4779360	do you have a text where you develop that precise point, many worlds, ideal observer,
4779360	4784240	everything objective, we just don't know where we are, is there a text by you?
4785360	4788800	Not yet, but I'm happy to write something down, like I said, I've just been thinking about it,
4789120	4796800	in the last few weeks, I like this idea that this is my dream, that I write texts so that
4796800	4803280	somebody will quote them, if it's directly, it's very possible if someone else has written it down
4803280	4808960	already, the big problem for me, yeah, you know, yeah, I mean it might be completely unoriginal,
4808960	4812800	that's very possible, so I will look to see if anyone else has already written it, and if not,
4812800	4816640	I will write something down, what's the trick that people use different terms, this nightmares
4816720	4822400	happen to me, they do, I know, yeah, you don't find it, but another guy with just different terms,
4822960	4830000	yeah, I know, the same thing, you know, we're all just remixing, Slavo, I know it's late for
4830000	4834400	you where you are, is it okay if I butt in with a couple of questions before we finish, yeah,
4834400	4841840	but don't expect, I mean, I'm here, I will direct them toward, toward Sean, and you can, you can
4841840	4847680	cut in as you, as you like, but now I love this idea, now I always make this joke when people
4847680	4854480	ask me, would you like to have a dialogue, I say, yes, I love dialogues, but the way they're written,
4854480	4862160	the late Plato's dialogue, where one guy talks all the time, and the other guy just every 10 minutes
4862160	4870640	says, by Zeus, so it is Socrates, so I really don't know, to that, please ask him, ask Sean.
4871920	4880560	Okay, yeah, so I haven't read any of Lee Smolin yet, though Einstein's Unfinished Revolution is on
4880560	4886560	my list, but so I've read an article that Slavo wrote, I think it's upcoming in a book next year
4886560	4891760	on quantum theory, but in it, in theory, just one short chapter, sorry, yeah,
4891760	4898080	yeah, just one chapter, just one chapter, but Slavoy paraphrases Smolin's belief that quantum
4898080	4904000	mechanics is the most successful theory ever formulated, but the only problem with it is that
4904000	4910160	it is wrong. And I have the sense that it is at least incomplete in that it doesn't
4910160	4915280	go here with relativity, so there's no quantum gravity, no theory of everything that's going
4915360	4921120	to find here at Smolin. Right, right, but what I'm wondering is how you glossed this idea and
4921120	4928080	more important, more relevant to our discussion is whether the many worlds interpretation is
4928080	4932240	something that's in jeopardy on the road to this theory of everything.
4933040	4939600	Yeah, so I, there is a temptation in certain circles to, sorry, that's that's a little too
4939600	4944480	prejudicial. We don't know what the final theory of everything is, right, so each one of us as
4944480	4949840	individual researchers will have our favorite ways of trying to make progress. And this goes back
4949840	4954240	to what we discussed at the very beginning about preferences for different versions of
4954240	4961840	quantum mechanics. Many worlds, as a theory, is as simple as it is possible for a theory to be.
4961840	4966720	The problem with it is that connecting it to the richness of the world involves some tricky
4966720	4972640	metaphysical and physical steps, right, about which people can be rightfully skeptical. Whereas
4972640	4978000	something like hidden variables or whatever is an ugly complicated theory, but the world is
4978000	4982480	ugly and complicated, so it matches the world in a more easy way. And you can, you can have
4982480	4986800	different feelings about what to do. Somewhat, there's a, there's a third way, which is someone
4986800	4992480	like Lee who says like, I don't quite see how it is working right now. Therefore, I will throw it
4992480	4999520	all out and start from scratch and try to do better. And to me, we're nowhere close to that
4999520	5005200	point yet. We have not yet done anything like trying to understand the world in the quantum
5005200	5011680	language to motivate trying to improve on quantum mechanics. In particular, just to be clear about
5011680	5017840	relativity, there's special relativity and general relativity. Quantum mechanics and special relativity
5017840	5023200	are 100% compatible. That is literally quantum field theory, which is the best tested theory in
5023200	5028560	the universe ever. General relativity, which says that space time is dynamical, and that's what
5028560	5035200	gravity is. It is true. We do not have a once and for all final quantum theory of gravity.
5035200	5041760	But again, to me, many worlds is the most promising route forward for doing that.
5041760	5046480	And if you'll indulge me just for, you know, one more minute here, the reason why I think we're,
5046480	5053920	we're stuck is because even the most highly trained physicist learns classical physics first.
5054880	5061760	Newton's laws, the Kepler's laws, the planets, etc. And then they're taught how to take a classical
5061760	5067600	theory and convert it into a quantum theory to quantize it, right? And that's what we do with
5067600	5073680	electromagnetism and the standard model of particle physics and all those things. There's no law, rule,
5073680	5079600	or even suggestion that says that the correct quantum theory of the universe has to be obtained
5079600	5084000	by starting with a classical theory and quantizing it. The universe doesn't do that,
5084000	5089280	it just is quantum from the start. And if you want to imagine that maybe that's why
5089280	5094080	it's been difficult to quantize gravity, because you shouldn't be quantizing gravity,
5094080	5098480	you should be thinking about quantum mechanics and finding gravity within it.
5099360	5103360	And clear, I would argue, I'm not going to bother you with it now, but I would strongly
5103360	5107360	argue the right framework to do that in is exactly many worlds.
5108800	5119200	But okay, now it came to me, my last, not attack, but problem. You know, I mentioned this, I admit it,
5119200	5126720	very suspicious parallel between many worlds and you pointed out immediately the difference and this
5126720	5133440	in our symbolic universe superpositions, this may happen, that may happen. But what is,
5134640	5140640	this is my restraint, not that the theory is too crazy, my god, I'm a Hegelian, the more crazy
5140640	5152560	it is, the more we like it. But I have another problem. But this different, for example, 99%
5152560	5162960	the discappals, 1% okay, and we have both. But though these two, or I don't know how many,
5163600	5170560	intimate universes, somehow interact or it's just totally different lines. This is, as a
5170560	5177200	philosopher, maybe it's a wrong instinct, I would be obsessed with some interaction, you know,
5177200	5183200	let's to say it's very primitive, what I will say, I in advance apologize once to say yes,
5183200	5191520	we live in this 99%, but somehow to understand it, you have to read it against the background of
5191520	5199840	that shitty 1%, which that's what I don't find in many worlds, or I don't know enough about it.
5199840	5205280	How would you react to this? The short answer is the different worlds will not interact.
5206240	5211440	This is something which Everett, when he first wrote down the ideas in the 1950s,
5211440	5215760	he was not clear on, he didn't have quite the technology that we have, the intellectual
5215760	5221360	technology we have. But this is exactly what decoherence gets you. Since the 70s and 80s,
5221360	5227600	when we understand decoherence better, it's not just that you are allowed to think about
5227600	5232480	different parts of the wave function as separate worlds. But it's literally the right way to think
5232480	5237520	about them. They don't interact, they won't interact going forward, because they've decoherent
5237520	5243520	from each other. And there's a technical exposition about that involving states in the environment
5243520	5248000	being perpendicular to each other. There's a small footnote there, because if you wait
5248560	5256080	really long, if you wait 10 to the 100 years, then all of the worlds will in some sense blur back
5256080	5264000	together into one big world. The use of our universe is a crucial feature in allowing these
5264000	5268640	different worlds to be separate. But even though Hollywood would like it to be otherwise, in the
5268640	5273360	real world, the separate many world branches are completely non-interacting with each other.
5275360	5281600	It was mentioned to me by our middleman that, did you or am I misreading you,
5281600	5287760	that you kind of read in detail the strip of that shitty movie and this very predicate makes it
5287760	5294240	clear why they don't like it, everything everywhere and so on. Because what I didn't like in it is
5294240	5300640	that with all these different versions, at the end it has this shitty conclusion, but this is the
5300640	5306720	real world, we should accept it and so on. I would like, what is missing for me in the movie is
5306720	5313920	precisely what you're going to tell this, but we don't know where we are and so on. This uncertainty
5313920	5320480	is lost, I think, in the movie. You know, you're completely right. I didn't read it ahead of time,
5320480	5325600	but I did interview the director's writers on my podcast. We had a wonderful conversation.
5325600	5331280	They're very smart people, but the demands of narrative are different than the demands of physics
5331280	5338000	is the problem. And not only multiverse movies, but time travel movies have the same
5338000	5344880	feature where even though there's multiple timelines or whatever, the narrative focus
5346080	5353040	implicitly lends more value to certain characters and devalues other characters.
5353040	5357360	And if this were the real world, that would be completely illegitimate, right? Like all the
5357360	5360880	different people in the different timelines, they have a right to exist. You're telling me
5360880	5366000	you're going to eliminate my timeline just because it's not yours? You're a genocidal monster. That's
5366000	5373200	terrible. No, because that's my problem. Now I will go even one step lower. Did you see Indiana
5373200	5382720	Jones's face? I did, I did. You did? Oh, we are normal people. You know, the moment I, like,
5382720	5389440	it's a shitty movie, but for some reasons I found some, first for me, it's a very desperate movie.
5389440	5395920	It's clear that Indiana Jones's desire is archimedes. I want to remain there. And that
5395920	5402240	beat punches him, go back. And it's a very desperate ending. Her function of fervor,
5402240	5410240	that actress, is not erotic. It's just to bring the couple back together. And you know how they are,
5410240	5418320	two desperate old men embracing and so on. Can you even compare this with being in Syracuse at
5418320	5425440	that point and so on? This I find much more productive. The conclusion is not, but this is
5425440	5434960	the real world or whatever. You know, I could not possibly agree more. I am, I don't like the movie,
5434960	5441200	but I find now, you know what attracted me to Indiana Jones 5? That it was so universally
5441200	5447920	attached, a total bullshit or whatever. It's, no, it automatically evokes my sympathy, no?
5449200	5455040	Well, there's, there's a fundamental conservative, teleological aspect to this way of thinking that
5455040	5461040	our timeline, our universe is the right one and we should be in it. And we cannot possibly think
5461040	5466000	about improving it by changing the past or anything like that. I think that the filmmakers missed a
5466000	5470800	chance they should have left Indy, spoiler alert, back there with Archimedes. He would have been
5470800	5477920	happier. He's getting old anyway. They went for a sappy lowbrow ending. No, but so at least
5478560	5485920	we can conclude in this way then that in spite of all from my side, unresolved dangers and so on,
5485920	5494240	we, you put it wonderfully now. The big lesson of also in many words, the quantum physics is
5494240	5501520	always bear in mind that this is not the only possible world. You know, don't, don't put this
5501520	5508480	universe as a major or as you put it nicely in this teleological sense, like that's what again
5508480	5515440	bothered me in everything everywhere. As if the reality is here in that tax office even with
5515440	5523680	genie liquor display and all these tricks gotten back is thus so that you return more satisfied,
5523680	5532160	happy to this world. I would opt for a much more desperate solution that, that she that actors
5532160	5538000	would have traveled in different worlds were many much better than totally desperate. She ends up
5538000	5545600	here with the awareness of what would have been, you know. You know, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't
5545600	5553840	see the script for that before it was made, but I did consult on the Avengers movies with Thanos
5553840	5560560	destroying the world and then they went back in time to fix it, etc. And I argued that if you go
5560560	5564800	back in time and fix it, you know, you're, they had this multiple timeline thing and I don't want
5564800	5570320	you to eliminate a timeline. I think that's, that's terrible. But as I said, what you should do is allow
5570320	5578000	the timelines to re rejoin each other so that individuals have memories of both in their
5578000	5582160	future selves, but they didn't go for that. It was too complicated. No, but that again, the problem
5582160	5592880	for me would be, I would like to rework many worlds interpretation, but I know I'm here
5592880	5599040	confusing a pure physical process with symbolic one where this would have been possible, you know,
5599040	5608560	this rejoining key, not in this sense, because as for this time travel travels and so on, you know,
5608560	5615280	which is a wonderful, totally pessimist version of it. I forgot the title, you know, the the
5615360	5623600	British now he's a little bit old actor Christopher Fry. She played Oscar Wilde also in the movie.
5623600	5632000	No, yeah. She wrote a novel which is so desperately pessimist. He even done almost
5632000	5641120	realistically physically scientifically nonsense. A guy, a scientist whose family died in Auschwitz,
5641840	5650480	wants to prevent this. So she invents a rather primitive time travel machine. Not you can
5650480	5657680	move up and down. Just you pick up a moment in time and you can do some little change there.
5658240	5666240	So what she does in this is this, this scientist, she there was in the village where Hitler was
5666240	5676240	born, a small stream above for which all the village was drinking water. So she puts around the time of
5677760	5686880	when Hitler had to be conceived, she puts into the water very limited intervention, just some
5686880	5696960	poisonous element which makes women infertile. So Hitler is not born. Then he steps out of his
5697600	5706240	laboratory and goes into the world and finds a nightmare. Nazism developed, but instead of Hitler,
5706240	5713680	somebody like Werner von Braun, a much more able scientist became the leader and developed the
5713680	5719520	bomb and the Nazis won. So here we have a wonderful, totally pessimistic denouement.
5720400	5728000	He tries to go back to bring back Hitler, so that at least the good guys will win.
5729360	5735920	I love, speaking about alternate histories, there is a wonderful book that I love, I forgot the title,
5736560	5743280	a whole book on alternate histories, stories about what might have happened with Hitler.
5743280	5748480	There are the usual lines, he survived, went to Argentina, whatever, blah, blah, blah. Then
5748480	5756800	different battles, how he might have won, but my favorite one is in his youth. Isn't this wonderful
5756800	5765440	alternate history? Hitler succeeds as a painter and whoops into painting his horrible visuals,
5765440	5774400	becomes a great modernist, becomes a celebrated artist and end of Nazism, so on, you know. Although
5774400	5782480	this is, I know, I don't take it seriously, but it's very refreshing to think along these terms,
5782480	5788240	that's all I'm saying. It was so delicious, sorry I'm getting tired, but I really will,
5789040	5795200	so you will write, you don't yet have that text. I don't, but I'll think about it, definitely.
5795440	5803280	Please, because, okay, then, can I, in quoting Q, refer to this event here? Because I really want to
5803280	5809840	immediately, quickly, in the chapter that you, the middleman know, I will add a footnote and,
5810400	5817120	as not a footnote, a couple of pages, but in a sincere way. You know how we intellectuals,
5817120	5822320	you are more honest, I hope so, physicist, human, you know how you cheat? I will
5823200	5831040	to write a page and then I put a footnote. When I already wrote these pages, I noticed that a
5831040	5838400	friend of mine will cheat a similar idea and so on, you know, Eurella, I will not do this, I will do it.
5838400	5846240	100% yes. I'm really grateful for this, because, you know, no, we didn't just blah, blah, and we
5846240	5852960	didn't just fraternally agree, we located the difference, but at the same time, we draw so many
5853520	5861440	precise lines, you know, because would you agree to finish in a more upbeat sense that, my God,
5861440	5869760	we live in a wonderful time where the big, the big even metaphysical questions are again
5869760	5876640	arising, you know, in the sense of, yeah, even one big fan sees it now, you cannot just
5877520	5884160	ignore it, no? Right, and I do want to, I just want to insert that if you, if you go back to the past
5884160	5889520	and change things, they like, as you imply, they might get better or worse, there's no rule that
5889520	5897440	we live in the best, or the worst, because I even read a pessimist novel about Stalinism,
5897520	5904880	where Stalin is killed, but he's killed in 35, and the one who takes over is Yezhov,
5904880	5909760	his secret policeman, and it's even worse, you can imagine, you know, if you were, yes.
5909760	5916480	Yeah, that's, I think my pessimist lesson also from my, although in Yugoslavia, communism was pretty
5916480	5924560	soft, you know, but you know, here also, I think a quantum approach in a general sense
5925360	5931440	gives you to think, for example, I will make not just a political point, but the modest ones,
5931440	5938240	I was recently at the round table, sorry, in London, and there were some black ladies from South
5938240	5946080	Africa, and I asked them frankly, I wanted to be honest, not Eurocentric, I said, listen, I read
5946080	5952240	a lot how in South Africa, electricity, cops, the state is falling apart, blah, blah, blah,
5952240	5959120	and I almost cried, one of the black ladies was so honest, he said I'm engaged for decades in A
5959120	5968560	and C struggle, but he told me he told us that the situation is now so sad that among the poor blacks,
5969280	5978720	blacks, poor in South Africa, you notice the predominant nostalgia forever, because he said,
5978720	5984560	listen, the standard of living was even a little bit better than now. They had enough thought, blah,
5984560	5990480	blah, now it's no electricity chaos, while there was, it was a police state which wins
5990480	5996720	less violence, some kind of basic order, and now, you know, the black are, you know, that now,
5996720	6004800	under, after three decades of how of A and C rule, you know that South Africa is a country with
6005680	6013280	the greatest tension between rich and poor in the world, in the entire world, and then, of course,
6013280	6019680	something totally predictable happened, another black lady attacked me, although I didn't say
6019680	6025200	anything, as a racist, you don't have the right to talk about this, you know, she played the game of
6025200	6032800	you, white people are responsible even now for all the mistakes, to be cynical, he played this in
6032800	6040080	bad sense, super determination, you white people are responsible for all the mistakes now, you know,
6040080	6049280	and here I think this kind of alternate thinking is necessary, like where did think really go wrong,
6049280	6057840	and I think it's too naive, because the radical leftist answer is too naive, it's because Mandela
6057840	6063360	didn't go to the end, if he were to make no compromise with, but then it would have been,
6064480	6071520	then it would have been Mugabe Zimbabwe, you know, only earlier there, you know, and this is a terrifying
6071520	6077840	problem for me, but we are losing time, listen, it was such a pleasure for me, I hope that we
6078480	6086400	meet again, and are you allowed the middleman to give me Sean's email, and no, but I have it,
6086400	6094400	because you CC connect, yeah, I have it, if I will, can I don't, don't be afraid, I'm not this
6094400	6101040	kind of a stalker who now in two hours will ask you 10 questions, and say this, but if I have a
6101040	6107040	short precise question, can I ask you and you give me one sentence answer, you know,
6108080	6111760	because you are my only, the last thing I'm always tempted,
6111840	6118880	it's sensational, but is it true what many quantum physicists, okay, sound, which means that
6119520	6126080	Stephen Hawking did his real work while he was young, lately he was more just popularizing
6126080	6131920	thing, is this true or it's not so simple? I mean, that's, there is some truth in that,
6131920	6136080	but there's also truth in exactly the same statement applied to a lot of people who did
6136080	6144080	not have a degenerative neuron disease, so he was obsessed with these hidden variables for decades,
6144080	6150480	but it's, he'll meet 20s that he did his great work, no? This is a young person's game, one,
6150480	6157280	no matter what your level of physical ability is. That's why I shade, it's even historically wrong,
6157280	6165280	this tendency to look at the old age, the last text of words by a big name, as if there is some
6165280	6171760	final truth in them, it's totally wrong, like to amuse you with the last story,
6172720	6179360	Jacques Lacan, when he was dying, had a young mistress, Catherine Mio, and she almost made the
6179360	6186160	career out of being there at his side when she was dying, and he mumbled some things,
6188160	6193840	what did she mean with those, well, what if it was nothing, it was just a confused trembling,
6193840	6201520	and I see this even with many philosophers, a lot of them reach their greatest point in their
6201520	6212720	middle ages, and then they just slowly go down, I mean, no? Well, I hope sincerely that in the battle
6212720	6222080	of quantum physicists, you will emerge as a winner, and then it's your KGB terror to
6222560	6228640	do, you know, when I give a talk, and you know, usually before they ask you there,
6228640	6233600	could you just say somewhere to test the microphone, you know what I always say,
6234800	6243280	Robespierre, no freedom for the enemies of freedom, this should be our motto, we thanks
6243280	6251040	very much, thanks very much, if you, the middleman, if there is something too stupid or whatever,
6251040	6257040	I give you, now I will be the victim, I give you all the Stalinist right to cut it short,
6257040	6263280	though we did whatever you want, I'm not a narcissist here, I'm really a communist at this
6263280	6268960	level, you know that whenever there is a conflict between an individual and an institution, I prefer
6268960	6275520	to be automatically on the side of the institute, because I edit some book series, and don't you
6275520	6283680	hate authors, you see, you talk one comma there, destroys everything and so on, you know, so I'm
6283680	6291680	really grateful for this, it helped me a lot, the only, my only reproach to you, Sean, is that
6291680	6298320	you ruined my evening, because I wanted this so dirty old movie, now I will have to go into it
6298320	6306160	and quickly write two, three pages, no? My apologies for that, that's what I do. No, here, I, you're
6306160	6312400	pardoned for everything, but not for this, when the people take power for this, okay, I'm a good guy,
6312400	6319920	you don't get gulag, but you will get two years of reeducation camp, you know, like, get up and
6319920	6325040	fight. I could use that anyway, that's okay, education is always good. Thanks very much, and
6325120	6332480	again, the middleman, really, I mean it, don't even ask me, do all the dirty stuff,
6333280	6339920	you know, all my confusions and one, sorry? The middleman is probably, is not going to be
6339920	6345120	cutting anything out, because this has been the middleman's most successful conversation yet,
6345120	6351280	since I haven't had to speak at all. But I like the middleman, the term, you know why, because
6351280	6357440	he wrote this show today, people don't like authority. I always like authority in the sense
6357440	6364400	that sometimes you need authority in the debate when it goes, but today, already at the level of
6364400	6370880	words, it gets confused, no longer likes to talk about director, leader, the favorite
6371600	6378480	term is ordinator, you know, it sounds, you keep all your power, but it sounds much more innocent,
6378480	6384240	you know, and just coordinating things, you know. So I know, and you know, that's why I still have
6384240	6390400	hope in Iran, I have connections there on the opposite side, and they told me, you know,
6390400	6395760	still you cannot contend Iran in spite of all that's going there now with something like Saudi Arabia.
6396480	6401920	Women were able to, women were able to protest precisely because they have a strong role, for
6401920	6408240	example, it's a common joke there that the big guy is a minister, usually a man.
6410080	6415840	Although, or even this is not the case, you have one, two feminine ministers in government, but
6418320	6424320	immediately when you make there to make a business deal, you discover that the minister is an idiot,
6424320	6429200	and you have to talk with persons around him who are in majority women.
6430160	6438880	What underestimated Iran, it's tremendous, they are so crazy, they translated 15 of my books,
6440160	6444960	they are, it's intellectual, no, this is not a good sign for them, it's a sign of contusion,
6445520	6452720	if I want to say is that it's intellectually alive, while in other countries, Egypt and so on,
6453280	6460880	it's very tragic how little they translate, they simply don't have this humanity, social sciences
6461600	6465440	life that we share, you know. The history does matter, the histories there are very different.
6466080	6472800	Yeah, yeah, but as Iranians point out, they are not simply a Muslim country, they are Farsi,
6472800	6480480	Persian, no, and they always proudly point out, we are not Arabs, you know, sorry for this
6481280	6487440	because today you never know what will be proclaimed as racism, you know.
6487440	6494160	Yes, thank you both, this has been a blast. Hold on Geeselings, before you go, please like,
