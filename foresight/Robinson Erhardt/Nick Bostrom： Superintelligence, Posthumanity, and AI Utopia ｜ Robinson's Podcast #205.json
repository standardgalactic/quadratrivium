{"text": " If you sort of zoom out, you look like we are right now in the middle of this like explosion of some sec and we don't know what it's going to end up like but but I do believe as you alluded to earlier that scenarios in which we just remain more or less like we are now and have the current human condition just keep going for like tens of thousands of years that just seems extremely improbable to me relative to either like extinction slash dystopia or some radical transformation into some kind of posthumous condition. Hello this is Robinson Earhart here with the introduction to Robinson's podcast number 205 and this episode is with Nick Bostrom a philosopher of artificial intelligence and many other subjects who was most recently professor of philosophy at Oxford University where he also served as the founding director of the Future of Humanity Institute. Nick is likely best known in the public eye for his work on the simulation argument which is the idea that we live not in the familiar physical world that we believe we inhabit but a simulation of one but he's also well known for his book Super Intelligence which covers the dangers of artificial intelligence and strategies for dealing with them. In this episode though Nick and I talk about his more recent book Deep Utopia Life and Meaning in a Solved World which just came out in March actually and opposed to get as opposed to getting into the existential dangers of AI which Nick tackles in super intelligence deep utopia considers the sorts of concerns that might arise if everything actually goes right with AI. So after talking about the alignment problem and some other fundamental issues in the philosophy of AI we talk about the problems that might come from having perfect technology from immortality from not having to work anymore from having robots that can do all your hobbies better than you can do and more.

But now without any further ado I hope that you enjoy this conversation as much as I enjoyed having in with Nick. You're one of the most widely recognized philosophers in the in the public sphere and mainly known in that capacity I think for thinking about dystopian AI scenarios scenarios and other existential threats so right off the bat I'm wondering what motivated this shift to thinking about utopias. Now both sides have always been present in my mind and my outlook. Back when I was writing super intelligence this 2014 book which was in the works six years prior to that I felt it was more urgent to focus on what could go wrong with AI figure out where the pitfalls were so that we could avoid them. This was a time at which the whole idea of AI posing any kind of existential risk or even just having any kind of transformative impact on society was still far outside the mainstream. The whole idea of the alignment problem was not in the overton window that were like maybe a handful of people scattered around the world kind of internet type so we're trying to work on this and it just seemed hugely neglected to me so I thought writing this book super intelligence trying to develop concepts that would make it possible for people to start to think more constructively about this and begin to do research on developing scalable methods for alignment was important. In the intervening years we've seen a big shift now all the frontier AI labs have research teams specifically trying to develop scalable methods for AI control and there are many other organizations as well where a lot of the smartest young people I know now are like flooding into this field and in the last two years we've also seen a big shift at the level of policy conversation where even top tier policy makers are now beginning to recognize the transformative impact of future AI developments with statements coming out from the White House and the UK hosted this global summit on AI. I was just the other week in Brussels for a however meeting and so to some extent that whole thing is now widely recognized and many of me feel a work on it. I felt the other side of what happens if things go right with AI had not yet really been addressed or people talk about it but often in a rather superficial way but once you start to dig in you realize there are actually quite deep even philosophical problems that come up when you imagine like what would give human life purpose and meaning in this condition where in a solved world as I call it like we're all practical problems that can be solved through progress have already been solved and so that's how the book it wasn't really so much a plan to write the book it more kind of happened as sometimes is the way of these things like you start writing a little and then it takes on a life of its own and you just try to hold on less the thing gradually develops. I can tell that this book really did take on a life of its own just because of the the various formats in which you wrote it and I mean there's there's poetry there's dialogue there's standard exposition so it was clearly a very creative project in a way that I mean philosophical articles are still creative but it's more of an intellectual creativity than an artistic creativity. Yeah some people maybe think they should have been a sort of more tough minded editor hovering over me to kind of but it actually does serve a purpose well for a start it's less a book about conclusions than it is about questions and exploration and I think this format with multiple different characters and voices helps you explore several different sides giving each one their due and letting them speak for themselves different values. So that's one reason for I think the form kind of works for the content the other is that the goal of the book is well in part to try to give the reader various concepts and considerations and such that they can you know better think about these things but another part is to try to put somebody in the right frame of mind for confronting these if you imagine that will actually perhaps at some point be some group of people who will have to form some opinions about what we want long term from these AI developments you know whether it's a few people in some lab or a government or some more humanity-wide deliberation process these are really difficult questions to deliberate about and I would like people who go into that to come at it with a certain attitude so a kind of broad-minded generosity combined with some playfulness and thoughtfulness and open-mindedness which I'm hoping that the book encourages and I think that those creative elements are also meant to contribute to that. That it is a long it's a long read so it is also maybe an antidote to short attention spans issue. Well before we move on to some of the substantive issues just a couple of comments it really was a great way of delivering a number of concepts to the reader I mean before reading this book I just thought of utopia as kind of a blanket concept but now I realize and we'll get into it there are various different types of utopias each of which have their own problems and considerations to keep in mind and then you said that this book tackles very deep problems about meaning and it's also I think very useful as a thought experiment for testing an extended thought experiment for testing our intuitions about meaning in the present so it's not just like it's useful for these future utopian scenarios it's very useful for thinking about our lives today for instance there's a passage on shopping that resonated with me very much as somebody who enjoys shopping but returning to the substance two things that you mentioned right at the outset that I think we should pin down for our listeners who might not have read superintelligence are one what superintelligence is since that's vital for the understanding of a deep utopia and then also what this alignment problem is because even though we will presuppose that it has been solved for a lot of this conversation I think it's still important to understand what it is. Yeah well so superintelligence is kind of any intellectual system that radically outperforms all humans in all cognitive fields and so including you know scientific creativity you know wisdom strategy like the full range really and the the alignment problem is the technical question of how if you were if you figured out how to make an AI that's generally capable of learning and planning and reasoning how could you then steer it in some particular direction to make sure that even when it becomes much smarter than you its creator it still does what it's supposed to do like what you intended for it to do that it's kind of on our side as opposed to becoming this antagonistic force that has different goals than we tried to give it that then works at cross purposes with ours probably speaking and and there are different ways that different people have tried to make that precise but that is more or less the gist of it. So yeah this book kind of just assumes our like postulates really that all of that the alignment problem is solved and also that the like governance problems are solved to whatever extent they can be solved so that like imagine we actually don't use this powerful technology to wage war against each other or to oppress each other and that like all these things that can be solved have been solved to whatever extent possible in order then to actually get to the point where we can ask these questions about value I have of course a lot of things to say in my other writing so about these issues of getting from here to there but there is a risk that if one starts to write about those one never actually gets to consider what it's all for ultimately like we are and I think this holds in general with our existences as well we are very busy like putting one foot in front of the other and maybe don't always take the time to reflect on where we are going or and especially at like at the civilization level a lot of effort is being put into making progress like growing the economy improving the technology making things more efficient but nobody really seems to have a clear notion of you know where does this lead us to in you know in 50 years time in 500 years time but anyway that's yeah so that that's that's all kind of now I don't know whether super intelligence is strictly speaking like a premise or like it is certainly is one technology which if we had that it would unlock a lot of other technological affordances and you would more quickly approximate this condition of a solved world but you could in principle imagine getting there just through a slower accumulation of human driven automation you could maybe imagine in the limit just as you can create a little program that automates a specific task on your computer or create a robot that makes one action in the car factor or something if we just kept doing that for a hundred thousand years or a million years maybe eventually we would have software and robots that could all the tasks and you could kind of at least get close to a similar situation without super intelligence you said that so both the the dystopian and the utopian sides of the coin were always on your mind from the beginning but at the time you wrote super intelligence though it had been gestating for seven or eight years you thought it was more a more pressing problem to deal with the the alignment problem and the pitfalls of AI but what I'm wondering is so there was a practical element in writing super intelligence I don't want to get bogged down and how we get from here to super intelligence because as you mentioned that can take us very far far afield and we won't actually ever get to the utopian questions but is there also a sort of practical dimension to writing about deep utopia because you think it is near at hand and we need to start thinking about it or is it more at this point just a philosophical exercise it's more the former for me actually I mean I do think we are on a seemingly fast track towards the AI transition and so it does give the whole set of questions greater practical urgency and that might be relevant in all sorts of ways like that might for example be points at which we may need to make some some trade-offs between taking on risks and undergoing this transition sooner versus delaying it in order to hopefully like make it safer although that exposes us to other risks independent of AI but and some of this might hinge on how urgent we think it is to improve upon or get out of the current human condition into something better if you think that anything on the other side is like bad right then you might just want to preserve the status quo for as long as possible if you think there is this like very wonderful utopia on the other side then maybe you think well let's let's make sure we get there before we all just die from aging or something and it would be worse taking some risk to make sure that we can reach that point so these questions do I think flow back possibly to decisions that people have to make but the main use case would be this if people are at one point having to design that trajectory forward and maybe they with AI advice are able to anticipate where it will lead and like you know one trajectory maybe leads to some kind of hedonism maximizing outcome another leads to some other complex situation a third might lead to some kind of radically planetary sized brains optimized for you know processing scientific knowledge or something and if some people need to make some judgments about the relative desirability of these then I think it would be good if they had thought more about it then there are their sort of decisions were not merely reflecting on the latest thing they had happened to read on twitter or like how they happened to feel that day like if they wake up in a good mood they think you know it's the future is great and has a lot of opportunity if they happen to wake up depressed they kind of are a nihilist I think it would be better if the world just disappeared and ideally whatever decision is made should reflect the kind of broader set of considerations and values and perspectives than that and so yeah contributing to that and I think I guess one more thing to be said about that is that the prospect of the future gone well I think is greater if people have this sense of there being great possibilities to realize not just one value but many values that if the future goes well it unlocks this huge I mean would have this super advanced technology plentiful resources a lot of time and there would be a kind of abundance and I think that can help people approach things in a more generous way than if there is extreme scarcity and like one person's gain is another's loss and there is not enough for everybody then it's very hard to be generous right it's easier to be generous if you have a lot and so thinking ahead if we could approach the future in this more cooperative and generous way I think that also reduces the risk of various dystopian outcomes and improves the prospect so those are some thoughts in the background yeah to speak I guess a little bit proverbially though that abundance has its own problems because what is a pleasure without pain and when we have everything I mean this is a big part of of the book in your project is where we find meaning in a world where we have everything and there is no scarcity to drive purpose in right yeah so so that's like the kind of the problem then that one confronts so much of our lives currently are structured around the various practical necessities that we face in our life so you have to go into work every day because you need to get the paycheck which you need to pay the rent you have to brush your teeth because otherwise your gum will decay and you have to you have to do this stat and you have like this like so much of our lives are just like doing something in order for something else to be cost as a result right and that that that kind of fills our life with sort of goal oriented activity but in this old world a very large chunk of all of that would no longer be needed like you wouldn't have to humans wouldn't have to engage in economically productive labor because ais and robots could do everything that needed to be done um yeah you you you wouldn't have to like spend an hour at the gym working out in order to be fit and healthy because you could pop a pill that would give you the same physiological effects and you can kind of go through activity by activity and you find that for many of them you can sort of either cross them out or at least put a question mark on top of them that although you could still do them at technical maturity they would seem to be a kind of pointlessness hanging over them like a dark cloud that maybe remove some of their value and so and and this is like I think yeah part of what would make from our current vantage point some of these scenarios at least prima facie look unattractive we kind of base our self-worth and dignity on the sense of making some doing something useful like you're a breadwinner or maybe you contribute to society in some other way or you like you you look after your kids or your grandkids and you like through your efforts and strivings like you actually make the world better in some place that it could in some way that it could not otherwise be and if that's removed then yeah there is a void that the utopians would have to somehow fill in I think a lot of the fun in this project comes from your imagination and looking at all the various examples of what life might be like and the technologies that might be available in a what you refer to as a technologically mature society and I want to talk about those things but before we do I mentioned earlier that there were I'm not sure if it was five or six I think five different utopias that you discuss in the book whereas I had thought that I just only ever thought there's one kind of utopia it's just heaven and I had left that unanalyzed heaven or something like heaven where everything's perfect but what are the the different types of utopia that you think are relevant to this discussion and and how do they differ and what are some of the basic problems that they confront the utopia dweller with yeah so so this is how I like how I classify them for my purposes but you could think of first category of sort of culture and politics utopia as many of the classical works fall into this category where basically the author tries to imagine a better political system or a better sort of culture so maybe you think there would be a different system of governance or like the gender roles would be defined differently or the way that children relate to their parents um and then it like different authors are different who is about the optimal way to arrange this and the optimal way would that be a utopia um now a slightly more I guess radical or like at least in one dimension more radical uh conception of utopia would be uh an abundance utopia where you imagine that there is plenty to go around so all material needs are abundantly supplied um and you do also find some of these um in the historical records like there was a a kind of medieval fantasy of the the land of kokai that was a kind of peasant vision of like the ideal life the rivers would flow with a wine and roasted turkeys would kind of drop down on the plate and that would be music and dancing and a lot of time for relaxing and and you can see if you were like a kind of agricultural labor like doing backbreaking work from morn to dusk and then just to have barely enough porridge to eat like this would already be like a fantastic conception right like you could eat as much as you want you could just stuff yourself with food and rest all day and like that so so that would be kind of an abundance utopia um and then then we have a kind of post-work utopia which is different from abundance utopia in that not only is there plenty of everything but humans don't need to work to produce it um and this is about as far as most mainstream conversation has gone in the context of AI you do find some economists who are starting to think about um automation and whether it could cause unemployment and if so what would happen like you know you maybe need some universal basic income etc and um like like in in Marx's utopia he doesn't fight very much about it but it seems he imagines that would be a sort of um certainly a culture's politics utopia according to his conception and then that would be like less work and more abundance but that would still be people would still be working so it's kind of but i think there are levels beyond that that you could consider which is um much more radical and poses much more deep problems uh in terms of human values so we have a post-instrumental utopia where it is not just the need for human economic labor that is rendered odious by technological progress but the need for all human labor that is instrumental in character so i mean i mentioned like you might have to labor at the gym to be fit but that you wouldn't have to do in utopia um right now if you want to understand mathematics you have to first study mathematics and spend hours working on exercise problems and like really exerting yourself right but in this condition of technical maturity there would be shortcuts to the same end you could imagine some swarm of nanobots infiltrating your brain and rewiring your synapses into a condition where you now possess mathematical knowledge without you having to put out any effort um so that kind of you know pulls the rug out of a wider range of human activity and exertion not just like the job that you go and do for eight hours a day but most of what fills the rest of your time um and then there's like a final stage beyond that which is i call a plastic utopia which has all the attributes of a post instrumental utopia but in addition um the human organism uh itself becomes malleable uh and subject to our wishes and desires so you could sort of choose what emotions you want to have or what thoughts you want to have or what moral character you want to have or what like physiology you have technologies to kind of reshape yourself uh at will um including your psychological states and and that then results in this kind of solve they're almost this old world where we're like all the kind of hard limitations that we currently face like are removed it seems and and the only thing that remains are kind of our values that i think have been shaped under this condition of scarcity which has like always been there for for humans throughout history like and um it's almost like formed an exoskeleton these practical needs uh and if you were to remove all of those practical necessities there is like the question of what happens to the this soft squishy parts like do they just become a blob like a drug doubt um a kind of pleasure blob uh or can they take some more interesting shape um and um yeah so that's so that's like the the main that there are a couple of early chapters that talk about some of these poor economic and technological but then the bulk of the issue is literally set in this condition of solve it as a solved world at this plastic and post instrumental i'd like to digress for a moment to this mathematics case that you brought up which i i find particularly compelling myself especially because it's an example of something i i said earlier where and you're examining what a mathematician might do in let's say a post instrumental utopia might tell us something about what mathematicians do and value today that might not readily be apparent so in this post instrumental world where we have extremely powerful automated theorem provers that might enumerate all the theorems of math and all the interesting axiomatic systems and there's no longer a role for mathematicians to be providing new proofs do you think mathematicians would still be around because i mean this is something that isn't this is one element of utopia that might not be that far out unlike some other ones because we already have automated theorem provers that are doing work that mathematicians can't do yeah so i mean people do i mean people play chess even though we have computers that can play much better chess or solve crossword puzzles even though there is no need for crossword puzzles to be solved and do a lot of other things currently right so the first answer one might think is yeah yeah sure we'll just do it anyway because it's fun now i think we can't stop at that point we need to like unpack this idea that we do it because it's fun so that could mean we do it because it gives us pleasure like somebody who is fascinated with mathematics probably derive pleasure from engaging in mathematical thinking and occasionally maybe finding a solution but if that's the only reason there would be again shortcuts to attaining pleasure in a solved world you could have more direct forms of brain manipulation that would stimulate your pleasure centers i mean you could imagine it as some sort of a super duper drug with outside effects and addiction potential or more likely some direct way of manipulating the relevant neural structures you know maybe we're all digital at that point anyway and you just and so yeah if all you wanted was to experience positive affect that there would be no need to do mathematics for that purpose so if you do nevertheless think that it would be better to do mathematics you then it seems value something other than just this hedonic state that you now very imperfectly and grudgingly like maybe like some little drips of pleasure is derived every once in a while when somebody who is enjoying mathematics does mathematics and there's probably just a lot of sort of boring futile effort and like uncomfortable straining to get to those occasional little drips of reward that's the stingy way our current reward systems are architected right so you could kind of open the floodgates to that and then have a kind of more blissed out psychological condition and so that's easy to dismiss a lot of people like immediately think that wow that's like what a horrific view of the future that is we're all kind of like junkies sprayed on some sort of flea-infested mattress but with like a super drug dripping into our nucleus incumbents and you know it might well be that ultimately we want and can have more than that but I it is actually a rather deep question whether we shouldn't dismiss too quickly the the super bliss as an element of what we would ultimately choose and have reason to choose perhaps nevertheless I think we can have that and have a whole bunch of other things on top of that that may be satisfy other possible value candidates so certainly if you do think that it is good to engage in certain types of activity you could do that as well there is no reason you could have complex experiences pleasure plus complex experiences plus various forms of goal-directed activity but maybe we're you know and we could talk more about why you would be adopting various goals if if you were in this post-instrumental situation but and and then perhaps some additional elements even beyond that that you could kind of reconstitute some of the prerequisites for instantiating human values even in this solved world condition I think what what motivated my asking this question was reflecting on two conversations I had in the past on the show one was with a renowned number theorist at Columbia University named Michael Harris that we had a couple of years ago so it's a little faint in my mind and another is with Steven Wolfram and we were talking about math in a world in which all of math is essentially automatable and today I think our folk view of what mathematicians are in the business of is just producing new proofs discovering or inventing depending on your philosophical view more facts to be added to this big book of math but what Michael Harris said and what I think Steven Wolfram agreed with is that mathematicians aren't just in the business of producing new facts they're in the business of understanding that's what really drives what they're doing is they want to understand these structures and I was thinking that in this post-instrumental world when mathematicians no longer have to produce proofs they still would be very interested in understanding and maybe teaching mathematics but then this raises another problem that I hadn't considered yet that you discuss in some of the later or the more advanced types of utopia where we have a matrix like system of downloading information where there's no long into our brains where there's no longer any real barrier to understanding you can understand anything as soon as you just downloaded into your mind so there's no there's not really an activity of being a mathematician anymore just if you want to understand the math then you press a button then you understand the math yeah so this is a very like advanced level of technology and it's like a little unclear exactly how close to this we could get but certainly if you imagine a human upload like a digitized version of a human mind and then you have on the outside some machine super intelligence that is able to like understand how the neural network that is you sometimes successfully can grasp mathematical concepts and in other cases fail and what variations of your neural network would be required like what edits to make it as similar as possible to you now but with this extra mathematical understanding I think it possibly would be the case that the job of working out how to adjust the various parameters in your brain to give you this mathematical knowledge could be outsourced to this machine super intelligence that is looking at a model of your brain and probably be able to do that without actually running a detailed simulation of your brain which if it if that were the only way for the super intelligence to work it out you might then think well you would actually then be instantiated in the simulation and you would have to put in the effort although the simulated version of you would do but I think probably you would be able to move up levels of abstraction to more or less obviate that need and so that you would then be able to yeah in effect download skills or knowledge without having to put in time studying and so yeah I think I mean and the teaching of mathematics is even more obvious I mean I think we are very close now to having tutorial systems that would be much better than most like high school mathematics I mean aside from keeping the class disciplined and making sure everybody sits at their desk or whatever like but the actual instruction I'd imagine maybe even chateau pt4 would like be a better explainer than than than most high school teachers because it can keep track of exactly where you are where you get stuck on a particular problem and sort of customize its explanation for you as opposed to doing something generic for the class of 30 just curious are you drawing the sort of distinction between chateau pt4 or gbt4 being a good high school teacher and a good university level professor because maybe there is insufficient training data on university level material for chateau pt4 to be able to explain it better than a university professor could I mean I so I don't know exactly I'd imagine there need to be some fine tuning maybe to adapt these large language models for specific use cases in the classroom I'd imagine the standard university courses like you know first and second calculus and like all of that stuff probably it would be able to explain Adam Madden as well as a mathematics professor I think maybe once you get to the research level of mathematics whether it's more matter of taste and then I'm not sure the current language models are quite yet there yet whether it would be as good as like a decent mathematics professor in terms of figuring out whether a research direction is is is promising or whether some proposal for say a phd is like the right level of difficulty that the student could possibly do it in four years and like like I think there there is like well there's obviously less training data written up for ingestion and and also it involves the the most high level human faculties that haven't yet perhaps quite been attained by the current generation of systems a term of art that you introduce in the book that I referenced earlier is technological maturity and I also mentioned that this is one of the the very fun things for me of reading deep utopia because we get to see your imagination at work and all the possible things that a technological mature society might have at its fingertips so to speak so how do you define a technologically mature society and what are some of the things that people might expect to be able to do or have on offer yeah so it's like a condition at which all those technological affordances that are consistent with the loss of physics and for which there is some possible trajectory from where we are now to their development exists so yeah it might be that you can't ever strictly speaking attain perfect technological maturity but in reality you might get some kind of close approximation to it if you have developed all the most useful general purpose technologies is perfect technical technological maturity being able to do anything that's physically possible well I would also have this pathway there but it might just be that if you imagine there are kind of an unlimited number of more and more specialized technologies for doing specific things it might be possible to develop any like small subset of them by like investing your r&d resources but if there is like quadrillion and quadrillion of different very specialized technologies maybe you can't develop the whole set of them but I think that would be sort of ways of getting close to that for most practical purposes like once you have superintelligence and nanotechnology you can sort of come up with the superintelligence can make arbitrary designs and the nanotech can sort of put it together and then like some other things you can I think get pretty close to that um so and and I think we know already at least some lower bounds of what this such a condition of technical maturity would involve that is technologies that we can already have good reason to think are physically possible and for which there is a pathway such that we could at least in the fullness of time under favorable condition get there so superintelligence is one of these like I think perfect virtual reality of the sort that would be indistinguishable to the person inside the physical like virtual reality from from ordinary basic reality would be another affordance I think like cures for aging uploading into computers space colonization at large intergalactic scales perfect newer technology in the sense of being able to control precisely our hedonic and emotional states cognitive augmentations like many other things as well but at least that already gives you a huge set of possible like things you can do right that's technological maturity one of the so the way that for our listeners who haven't looked at the book yet the book is organized so it's kind of like a a course you're teaching to these imaginary students and at various points in the book there are handouts where you've summarized some of the material and I have a handout number two some capabilities at technological maturity on the screen before me and I was just glancing at them and one that jumped out at me is the possibility of Dyson spheres for harvesting the energy output of stars and this comes to mind for two reasons one is well I'll just focus on one but the reason is I've done a number of episodes on string theory and been thinking a lot about string theory lately and one of the big barriers to empirical confirmation of string theory is that we cannot generate enough energy to probe sufficiently small distances to confirm the existence of strings and people have conjectured that the sort of energy you would need is the energy of a star so it looks like we'll be able to confirm or disconfirm string theory in a very useful technology the Dyson sphere but yeah like you mentioned arbitrary sensory inputs reversal of aging uploading of biological brains into computers and all of these things engender their own host of philosophical questions to be asked and answered aligned police bots and automatic treaty enforcement I mean and police bots are already a question being asked today but you know reversal of aging and cures for all diseases that's one that jumps out at me or a couple that jump out at me right now are there any particular problems that would need to be dealt with in these later stage utopias if we just lived forever well I mean the most obvious one would be the size of the population which is able to increase exponentially and if nobody dies then at some point the rate of births would have to match the rate of acquisition of new resources in order to maintain high per capita incomes because at technological maturity there wouldn't be increases in productivity like that's one of the things that drive technological growth now right even if the resources are the same you could have better technologies to make more efficient use of them but that will have maxed out and so then the only way that the economy could grow at that point is if more resources are attained through expanding in space but that can at most happen at a polynomial rate like you have a bubble that is growing in all directions at some significant fraction of the speed of light and the volume of that grows as a polynomial of time whereas the population like could grow exponentially right and so then eventually you would have a Malthusian condition and so in the limit you would need to sort of make sure the the rate of population increase which might be sort of digital minds making copies of themselves right but would kind of at most match the rate at which the the resource endowment increases like another maybe more philosophically interesting question if we eliminated aging and then I mean right now what would happen if you eliminated aging is that people would die from accidents and wars but maybe with a lifespan of a few thousand years if you kind of calculate the rate of death by accident now hopefully we will bring down the rate of accidents and and war certainly in utopia you'd imagine that to go way down and if you could upload yourself to computers then you could make backup copies and stuff and then the rate of accidents could kind of become arbitrarily small so then then you might have very long lifespans even astronomical and and that presents more interesting philosophical questions for human values in that well first of all we don't know what would happen to like if you remained a human mind of like a brain with your current size and the number of synapses and stuff like we know you can continue to learn and develop and grow for like a hundred years but we don't even know what would happen if a human just kept living for 400 years like would you go stale and rigid and like so and even if that didn't happen in a sort of like neurological way like then it might still be that and it's a hard question to sort of gauge but that the number of different types of things that can be done with a human mind and body in a human world is finite and is that number small enough that it would become relevant so that at some point you would just run out of interesting new things to do and if so how long like I mean I think given that we are finite there has to be some number of years after which you would literally be doing the same thing you'd already done but if that is kind of 10 to the power of a hundred or something we might not have to care very much because we'd die anyway before that from the heat death of the universe but if the answer is like 10,000 years like after 10,000 years you'd basically just repeat yourself then either you'd have to accept that such lives will have a diminution of a certain kind of novelty and that may be a price to admittance and this kind of extreme longevity in utopia or you would have to perhaps start to level up after you have spent at 10,000 years being a human maybe then you would want to become a transhuman like increase your intellectual faculties or something and you could kind of start to tackle the next level of challenges and keep developing that way but it is I think it is one direction in which you can kind of take our current human values and where they start to become strained if you just imagine the current human lifespan with our current values and our current faculties but just extended and like prevented from physical disease like at some point I think that would possibly become unattractive like there are still a lot of things in human life that don't require novelty I mean like a cup of tea is like about as good like the 10,000s time as it is the second time or first time right it they're like renewable pleasures and sometimes you could run the argument that sometimes the best things in life are the little things that it's not like like the big dramatic narrative climaxes but it's like you know the smell of autumn air in the evening along a stroll along the coast or like looking into your loved one's face or a little you know cup of tea or whatever like these little things sometimes you know you could run the argument that that's a fairly high quality value although we give them kind of short shrift an interesting connection to the philosophical literature going back hundreds of years I mean is how conceptions of personal identity might shift in this world where we live for we live indefinitely I think and you should correct me if I'm wrong but I think it was Locke who proposed that personal identity has something to do with memory and psychological connectedness and maybe it was Derek Parfit in his sort of ongoing discourse with David Lewis who questioned whether somebody who lived who wasn't immortal would eventually no longer be the same person that they started out as because they would not remember let's say their childhood F there would no longer be any psychological connection to a person stage thousands and thousands of years earlier and in this sort of utopia maybe we would bypass this by getting memory implants or memory chip implants so that we could just continually add new memories and maintain internal psychological connectedness yeah um I mean I guess there is first of all like I would want to make retain the distinction between long time and infinity like immortality I think you should mean not dying not not just taking a while before you die like conceptually and it is important because immortality in that strict sense just might be impossible in our physical universe and be the preserve of say more theological scenarios and from the blink view of eternity like whether you live for like 80 years or 80 thousand years it's kind of in some sense the same right it's an infinitesimal short relative to infinity either way now I do think that yes increasing I call it time time suits but the idea that we could make some modifications tasks that make us better able to survive radical change without having our identity eroded or our values corrupted so the most obvious thing would be to improve our episodic memory so that you actually don't just forget what you've been through and that could make you sort of remain relevantly the same for longer than if you just have like the memory of a goldfish and and you could imagine some other tricks as well that would allow us to sort of endure for longer periods of time and and upgrading our capacities in different ways could help with that um but even if it came to a point where you would have to accept some loss of personal continuity in in whatever relevant sense I mean it might be acceptable like if you if you were have a five-year-old and you know that if there were a pill that would just arrest their development that they would remain a five-year-old like in some sense maybe a year from now that would be more similar to what they're now than if they're just allowed to freely develop uh but we might still think it's better for them to grow up like in some sense you are the same person now as you were when you were five but in realistically you're also quite different right in many ways uh and uh and maybe that's not an unambiguously bad thing like and so I think the combination of these that um a uh we can reduce the negative effects of various kinds of uh corroding uh consequences of the passage of time through improving memory and other certain other positive attributes like also including like maybe extending your planning horizon etc and and then also accepting some degree of of change even if it does mean that you eventually move further away from what you once were if there's still a difference between that and just dying because at any given point in time you might look forward to hundreds of years of existing in some very similar things your current condition and and you would gradually sort of you know see new ways of doing things or being or new experiences that that feels a lot more optimistic to me than it then like a kind of you're gonna be shot tomorrow morning right it's a um this the smoother and gentler way of losing our connection with the past seems perhaps prudentially preferable um even to the extent that it is unavoidable relative to yeah um the alternative okay not that a lot of this or all of it hasn't all been speculative but i have a particularly speculative question to ask so when i spoke with avi lobe the harvard astrophysicist this this brings us back to dyson spheres he conjectured that umuamua this comet that passed us by in i believe 2017 might have been part of a dyson sphere and you have made your own very uh i don't know if splashy is an adjective but powerful uh controversial conjectures about for instance whether or not we might be in a simulation and i'm wondering if you think it is possible or likely even that there are societies out there that have already reached uh for instance a post scarcity utopian stage because i think the having a dyson sphere if whoever sent uamua our way had a dyson sphere we would classify them probably as being in a post scarcity period assuming that they still have other dyson spheres yeah i mean so that i mean post scarcity they might not i mean it depends a lot on what their goals are and um it might be that the dyson sphere of resources is nowhere near enough for what they are trying to do um and so it is to some extent a human con like um it's not like a very precisely defined concept it's like you could say like from few humans so you could say that we are already uh somewhat close in some respects well if you're if you are like fortunate enough to live in a in a in a rich country and you have a i don't know like you're healthy and trying to good education like probably most of your listeners like it's probably the case that um uh if if you wanted to you wouldn't really have to work to survive like or if you select say say you worked hard really hard for five or ten years and saved up all the money you probably could then move to thailand or something and buy a small hot near a beach and then have enough to eat and be physically healthy and you'd have a computer you could eat access the internet or whatever for the rest of your life without having to work like it's at least tantalizingly close uh but yeah people choose to continue to strive because they want more than just the basic necessities of life right like and in particular we want to have more than other people and so there's a lot of this kind of um zero some status consumption going on with humans um and that could drive scarcity up to astronomical levels right like you yeah you have your own dyson sphere but uh like i have four dyson spheres so like you still need to try to um catch up and and and intergalactic civilization might have practical reasons as well like maybe they fear some other intergalactic civilization that might have a larger fleet of worships or something and so um but the difference is like um even if human desires are insatiable it doesn't mean there will always be a need for human work like you could reach a condition where even though like you maybe are worth a trillion dollars and you would like to make another trillion dollars there's just nothing you can do with your own labor that would make you any significant amount of money because all the work is better done by machine and if the most you could make is the minimum wage then once you're a trillion year like there is no point really working right because it's trivial compared to what you just earned from your capital and and it might even be that by doing the work yourself you like expend more calories that cost you more than the actual value of the labor so you could still end up in this kind of condition of um uh unemployment or post work even if there are still needs that have or desires that haven't been fully uh satisfied um now you asked whether I think there are already some that have attained either poor scarcity or I guess you could generalize it into technological maturity and I think if the universe is infinite as it seems to be like if we have the simplest topology and an opener flat spacetime um then definitely that would be uh such civilizations in fact infinitely many of them out there but um if I had to guess I'd say none in our in the observable universe and so that there would be infinitely many of these but they would have low density and so um um we might be out of causal contact forever with the nearest other one um that certainly would help explain the Fermi paradox um but it's not the only possible explanation so we can't rule out that we could share the observable universe with some other civilizations as well. Speaking of intergalactic civilizations and intergalactic warfare obviously that would be a huge barrier to us reaching a utopian state if we had to ascend off uh an alien invasion but do you see any other barriers besides just our ability to produce a super intelligent technology or super intelligent AI other barriers beyond that to our reaching utopian states? Uh yes I mean first of all it would be uh crucially super intelligence is well aligned um because otherwise yeah that might be our undoing um and second if you have scenarios uh multipolar in character like if you have many different entities ultimately with our own AI uh assistance that then a lot of the same dynamics that uh we see on the planet today with arms races and um oppression and warfare and exploitation of the global commons by sort of spewing pollutants into the atmosphere overfishing the oceans all of that could still occur and and indeed could be intensified in this kind of hyper competitive economy that might be created um if on the other hand you don't have a multipolar but like a unipolar or as I call like a singleton scenario where it gets all consolidated then there is the obvious question of um who controls that uh singleton right and how uh benevolent and wise is whatever the mechanism whether it's like a global democracy or a dictatorship or whatever it is is like so I think we can identify several broad categories of things that need to fall in place so one is to have this kind of uh deep utopia a you would need super advanced technology like otherwise you just can't do all of the if you right now we can't cure the jit with a cancer in many cases right and that means our world will fall short of what it should be so the super advanced technology but then I think also we'd need um a fairly high level of cooperation slash good governance to prevent sort of negative some conflict and then we'd also need some adequately high level of wisdom in how we use these great uh technological powers that we have um and it might be that the wisdom is it has a kind of threshold effect where if you're above that threshold even if you're still uh unwise in many deep ways and have many erroneous beliefs and misconceptions you might have enough wisdom to realize that you are fallible and to start to seek out ways to fix you can reflect on your own shortcomings and gradually develop ways of remedying it but if you're sort of below that wisdom level you might be more likely to lock in your current prejudices uh or to shoot your foot off when you're trying to like develop ways to fix it and it's kind of actually an open question I think where humanity is relative to that because you could ask the same question at the collective level like are we I think we are maybe close to the threshold level but I'm not sure whether we are just under or just above it um and um and then we might need some bit of luck as well on top of that um but um um I think yeah although these are kind of extreme technological postulates and you might see them very wide wild ideas I still think um they might actually not be completely unrealistic even within our lifetime if this whole AI transition happens um and it's if you sort of zoom out and look at the human history like uh from from its inception like you know a few hundred thousand years ago to today and you plot that in any possible way you you might want to like whether it's like the amount of you know um you know the GDP let us say or like some sort of the energy expended by human civilization or like in any it does have this you like if you plot it on a linear scale you just see a flat line that just spikes up at the end of the graph so then you have to go to like a log plot or to even see it bending but even then it bends up and we're really sitting right now at this like ridiculous anomaly um where what we are currently taking to be the normal human condition is in any which way look at it like just extreme historical anomaly like a tiny little thin coat of paint on on like a giant uh battleship of human history right it's like it and and then now we think it's like a radical conception to think well what if that changes in the future whereas in fact if you sort of zoom out you look like we are right now in the middle of this like explosion of something and we don't know what it's going to end up like but um but I do believe as as you alluded to earlier that scenarios in which we just remain more or less like we are now and have the current human condition just keep going for like tens of thousands of years that just seems extremely improbable to me relative to either like extinction slash dystopia or some radical transformation into some kind of post-human condition well Nick I I really enjoyed deep utopia and I came out of it with so many ideas and concepts that I hadn't considered beforehand so thanks so much for writing the book and
