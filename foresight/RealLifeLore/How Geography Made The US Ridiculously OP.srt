9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,080
The United States of America is the most powerful empire that has ever existed in human history,

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,960
without even being the absolute largest in terms of overall territory.

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,360
No other empire has ever been as capable of so thoroughly enforcing its will across the rest of

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,960
the planet. Economically, the United States has continuously remained the world's largest economy

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,760
since the 1890s, and is the only country that has ended every single decade with a larger economy

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,640
than it started with for the past 150 years. The US dollar is the primary reserve currency

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,920
used by most of the world's nations. America's government is the second longest continuously

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,400
run regime in the world. And despite making up just 5% of the contemporary human population,

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,920
the United States controls around 30% of the entire planet's wealth, and produces 20%

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,480
of all global manufacturing. And complimenting America's tremendous economic might is also

19
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:52,560
her unprecedented military strength. The US military alone represents nearly 40% of all

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,720
worldwide military spending. The US Navy represents half of the worldwide naval fleet.

21
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,040
The United States controls more than 750 overseas military bases across every conceivable theater

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,160
of the world, enabling America to attack any threat anywhere on the surface of the planet

23
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,400
in less than 48 hours. And while there are many factors that contribute towards this

24
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,560
unprecedented global power and influence of the United States, the biggest reason for it,

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,800
and the true source from which all American power stems, is the fact that the geography

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,000
and the geology of the North American continent itself is just insanely overpowered from a

27
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,640
civilization-building standpoint. In fact, it's so outrageously overpowered that it's not even

28
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,520
really fair to any of Earth's other civilizational start points, and it was almost inevitable that

29
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,320
any civilization that began where the United States did, regardless of people or ideology,

30
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,800
would have eventually emerged as the dominant global superpower. So allow me to explain,

31
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,280
in depth, why that's the case. To begin with, the core geographic reason of America's global

32
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,600
power and the core of the North American continent itself is almost certainly the Mississippi River,

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,200
and the vast basin that surrounds it wedged in between the high Rocky Mountains in the West,

34
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,360
and the low Appalachian Mountains in the East, interconnecting with the Illinois,

35
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,760
Ohio, Tennessee, Red, Arkansas, and Missouri rivers as well. Most of the tributary rivers that feed

36
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,000
into this enormous system spanning one third of the entire continent begin at relatively low

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,280
elevations, which effectively means that the majority of the basin's rivers are calm and

38
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,120
absent of any obstacles like rapids, and have therefore been easily navigable for thousands

39
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,880
of years without the need for any advanced technology, expensive development, or infrastructure.

40
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,080
The most important thing to understand about the Mississippi River itself is that it is the

41
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,600
longest navigable river in the world, meaning that since time immemorial,

42
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,560
anyone could essentially sail a boat carrying supplies or people from the Gulf of Mexico

43
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,720
into the Mississippi's mouth and up more than 3,000 kilometers deep into the North American

44
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,040
interior before hitting the river's only natural waterfall here, which, without coincidence,

45
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,920
is exactly where the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul was settled. The navigable section

46
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,640
of the Mississippi River from these waterfalls, down to the Delta in the Gulf of Mexico, is more

47
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,400
than three times the length of the Rhine in Europe, and a third longer than even the Danube,

48
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,800
Europe's second longest river. Navigable rivers like the Mississippi or the Rhine

49
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,040
are tremendously valuable to generating economic activity, because they are substantially cheaper

50
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,040
to use as transportation of goods and people than land-based infrastructure. Roads and railways require

51
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,320
not only high initial costs to construct, but high ongoing maintenance costs to keep them

52
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,600
functioning and running as well, whereas rivers are already there and are basically just free to use.

53
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,200
The only costs involve creating ports and boats to carry stuff up and down them, and as a result

54
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,760
of that, shipping products by water as opposed to land is anywhere from 10 to 30 times less

55
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,600
expensive in the modern 21st century era, and civilizations who have more navigable rivers

56
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,280
will be able to retain substantially higher amounts of profits from all the capital that

57
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,280
they'll be saving on transportation costs. This fact instantly makes the Mississippi River,

58
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,520
as the longest navigable river in the world, tremendously economically valuable to anybody

59
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,240
who controls it. Farms and factories built along or nearby the 3,000 kilometers of its banks between

60
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,600
the Delta and the Gulf of Mexico, and the waterfalls at Minneapolis St. Paul, are capable of cheaply

61
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,840
exporting their products further downstream and out into the world ocean toward global markets.

62
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,880
But the Mississippi River itself is only the main stem of the overall greater network of

63
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,640
navigable rivers found across the greater Mississippi basin, granting settlements as deep

64
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,760
into the interior of North America as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Minneapolis, Chicago, Sioux City,

65
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:26,640
St. Louis, Memphis, Muscogee, Shreveport, and more to effectively become oceanic ports,

66
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,480
all capable of exporting their various products cheaply down the Mississippi River network

67
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:39,840
towards the Gulf of Mexico. But it isn't just this uniquely vast system of internally

68
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,320
navigable rivers within North America that give this continent such an advantage to commerce.

69
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:53,040
It's also the fact that around much of North America exists another highly unique geographic

70
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:00,160
feature that cannot be found anywhere else in anywhere near such a useful pattern. The many,

71
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,760
many barrier islands that exist in an almost continuously uninterrupted chain for more than

72
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:13,680
4,800 kilometers, around three-fourths of the U.S. Gulf and East Coasts. From the southernmost tip

73
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,120
of Texas where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf, up to the Chesapeake Bay that harbors Washington

74
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,920
D.C. and Baltimore. In effect, these countless low and flat islands have transformed what would

75
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:33,120
otherwise be 4,800 kilometers of exposed coastline into a network of protected shielded bays that

76
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,840
can be effectively utilized as a sort of oceanic river, relatively navigable all the way from

77
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,360
Brownsville, Texas to Baltimore, Maryland. And since the Delta of the Mississippi River empties

78
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,200
out directly into this further navigable network, it means that goods have been able to be cheaply,

79
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:57,440
reliably, and quickly transported from all throughout the North American interior to all

80
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,760
across the Gulf and East Coast now for hundreds of years. When collectively added together,

81
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,840
the internal rivers of the Mississippi basin and this external intracostal waterway wrapping

82
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:17,760
around the Gulf and East Coasts account for nearly 25,000 kilometers of combined navigable

83
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,680
waterways, which is not only more than the rest of North America combined, but more than the rest

84
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:31,120
of the entire planet combined. The end result is the greatest natural transportation system to be

85
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,680
found anywhere in the world. An enormous network of freely available riverine superhighways that

86
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:46,000
causes 90 percent of the lower continental 48 United States to be within just 240 kilometers

87
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,680
of an easily navigable waterway. And it was all just effectively given to the United States more

88
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,560
than two centuries ago, back in 1803, when the French decided to sell all of it for about $340

89
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:06,080
million in today's currency valuation. And then the power that the system of natural navigation

90
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:13,760
offers the United States is even further exacerbated when you consider that it spans across what also

91
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,480
just so happens to be the largest contiguous stretch of arable farmland on the planet as well,

92
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,240
the American Midwest. The westernmost portion of the Midwest,

93
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,960
located within the rain shadow cast by the towering Rocky Mountains of the continent,

94
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,160
is dry but temperate and perfect for growing wheat like Ukraine and southern Russia,

95
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,040
while the central portion is temperate and humid, perfect for growing corn and soybeans.

96
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,960
Today, an area more than twice the size of France is under till within the Midwest alone.

97
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:51,120
And as a result, this region produces nearly a third of the entire planet's supply of corn

98
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:58,400
and soybeans, and more than $150 billion worth of agricultural produce overall per year.

99
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:06,800
And all of this enormous agricultural land happens to also roughly overlap with the world's largest

100
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,920
network of easily navigable rivers. It is a perfect, natural recipe for an agricultural

101
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,360
superpower to develop from. And when further considering the fact that the Intracoastal

102
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,800
Waterway Network further services the transportation needs of everything from Texas to Maryland,

103
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,200
the Colombian Snake Rivers flow through the agricultural zones of the Pacific Northwest,

104
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,240
and the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento River help out within the Central Valley of California,

105
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,840
you can quickly see that with very few exceptions, the vast majority of all of America's agricultural

106
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,200
regions are within just 240 kilometers of a navigable waterway to the ocean,

107
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,280
enabling food grown across the rural parts of the continent to easily and cheaply be transported

108
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:59,040
to the same continent's urban population centers in a way that simply no other continent on the

109
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,360
Earth could ever match. And we're still pretty much just at the beginning here of explaining

110
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,720
the sheer scale of North America's geographic advantages towards maritime power and commerce,

111
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,560
because you also have to consider the many, many natural indentations of the continental coastline

112
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,520
itself that creates many of the greatest natural oceanic deep water harbors in the world. In order

113
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:32,480
for a natural harbor to make a good port, they must really have three crucial ingredients, deep

114
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,960
passages for shipping, enough resources in the immediate hinderland to support cities that can

115
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,800
support the port, and plenty of coastal frontage area. When only considering natural harbors

116
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,240
across the world that possess all three of those critical factors, the top three largest of them

117
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,800
are all within continental North America and controlled by the United States outright.

118
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,440
The Chesapeake Bay between Maryland and Virginia, the San Francisco Bay surrounded by California,

119
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,120
and the Puget Sound of Washington State. These three are arguably the most impressive

120
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,960
natural harbors found anywhere on the surface of the Earth, while the Chesapeake Bay itself,

121
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:19,040
all on its own, has a longer coastline than the entirety of India combined. When added together,

122
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,360
the entire coastline of the modern United States is well over three and a half times the length

123
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:32,320
of the entire African continent, despite the fact that Africa itself is more than three times larger

124
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,000
than the United States in terms of overall land. This means that the United States coastline on

125
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,240
the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific has a greater overall potential for ports than any other country

126
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,560
on the Earth, bar none, and can even fit in significantly more ports than entire other

127
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,600
continents are capable of. And then there's also the fact that with a little modern civil

128
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,320
engineering, the United States acquired a second enormous internal navigable waterway in the mid-20th

129
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,240
century, the Great Lakes. Due to the fact that the Great Lakes are naturally full of rapids like,

130
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,200
you know, Niagara Falls, and the fact that the connections between the lakes often freeze over

131
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,640
during the winter, they were never naturally navigable on their own all the way through history

132
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,920
until the very late 1950s, when a series of locks and canals were completed by the Americans and

133
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,040
Canadians. Now, the Great Lakes serve as a complementary internal water transportation

134
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,200
system to the Mississippi basin and intercoastal waterway, enabling even further cities deep within

135
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,680
the continent to effectively become oceanic ports from Duluth to Detroit to Cleveland and Buffalo.

136
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,320
And then there's the fact that through a series of artificial canals, the Mississippi

137
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,440
basin system and the Great Lakes system are now connected with each other, and barges can

138
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,600
effectively freely navigate with their cargoes in a giant circle around the entire eastern

139
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:05,360
United States. But great as it is, the Mississippi basin does contain a couple of critical geographic

140
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,320
vulnerabilities that can be exploited by America's enemies and both revolve essentially around New

141
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,600
Orleans, the most strategically important city in the entire United States. Because it serves as

142
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,000
the gates between the entire Mississippi River Super Highway Network and the intercoastal waterway

143
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and Gulf of Mexico. Should New Orleans ever fall into enemy hands or be somehow destroyed,

144
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,520
the link between the greatest river network for transportation in the world and the global ocean

145
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,760
would be blocked. And the whole system, along with the American economy, would effectively

146
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:50,000
break down. And there are theoretically two arguably easier ways to accomplish this, besides

147
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,080
from capturing or destroying New Orleans itself. The first way is to take advantage of Cuba. You

148
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,600
see, Cuba is probably the most strategically valuable piece of the North American board that

149
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,080
the United States doesn't outright control or have significant influence over. This is because

150
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:14,320
of the way the island juts into the Gulf of Mexico. Creating two straits that all ships coming back

151
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,960
and forth through the Gulf and the greater world ocean have no other choice but to pass through.

152
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,040
The Florida straits in the North or the Yucatan strait in the South. All on its own, Cuba is too

153
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,480
small of an island to ever leverage the strategic position to threaten the trade of America's

154
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,520
underbelly between New Orleans, the Mississippi basin, the intercoastal waterway, and the outside

155
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:44,880
world. But when placed under the sway of a major power from another continent, it absolutely can

156
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,480
be, as nearly happened during the early 1960s, when the Soviet Union began placing nuclear

157
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,320
missiles and troops there. Cuba can hypothetically be utilized as a springboard to attack the United

158
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,240
States' most significant geographic advantage. And as a result, Washington has been actively

159
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,280
carrying out the longest trade embargo of modern history against the island for more than 60 years

160
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,280
now, desperately hoping to bend its people towards its will and to prevent any large,

161
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:22,240
hostile foreign power from ever becoming too established there. The other incredible weakness

162
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,280
is almost paradoxically the Mississippi River itself, which has desperately wanted to change

163
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:35,920
its course now for decades. For thousands of years now, the Mississippi River has always meandered

164
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,920
around over long periods of time, and its delta has shifted across various positions along the

165
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,680
Louisiana Gulf coast. Back in the 1970s, the river would have naturally shifted course away from its

166
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,440
current path, beginning in a location that hardly anyone will have ever heard of, the small town of

167
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,640
Vidalia, Louisiana. From here, the Mississippi would have begun flowing into what's currently

168
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:05,280
known as the Achafalaya River, down to a new delta in the Gulf about 120 kilometers southwest of

169
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,200
present-day New Orleans. Had this been naturally allowed to happen, the entire Mississippi River

170
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,640
would have diverted completely around the cities of Baton Rouge and New Orleans, leaving their

171
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,520
river-based infrastructure stranded and their people without any source of freshwater, and

172
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,520
creating a new delta for the river in an area that is presently, essentially, the middle of nowhere.

173
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,440
The end result would have been an economic catastrophe for the United States of unprecedented

174
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,120
proportions. And so, in anticipation, the United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed what

175
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:46,400
is probably their proudest accomplishment. The $2 billion old river control structure

176
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,840
within the small town of Vidalia, which artificially forces the Mississippi River to

177
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,520
unwillingly continue down its historical path towards Baton Rouge and New Orleans,

178
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,000
where all the infrastructure built up over centuries is actually located.

179
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But should this structure ever somehow fail in the future, the mighty Mississippi would almost

180
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,880
immediately and violently snap courses to flood down the Achafalaya towards the Gulf instead,

181
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,120
flooding everything in its path and effectively destroying the utility of all America's industrial

182
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,520
and agricultural processing infrastructure between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, and temporarily

183
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,360
shutting down most of the Mississippi Basin's superhighway system until new infrastructure

184
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,680
could be built down in the new delta. These weaknesses, though, are essentially only hypothetical.

185
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:45,360
The fact is that the land where the United States is placed in is the best suited location in the

186
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,640
entire world for a civilization to develop into a colossally capable maritime empire,

187
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,400
for all the reasons that I've already explained, and for many more. For example, there's also the

188
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,240
fact that for centuries now, the United States has been capable of developing within this continental

189
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,640
sized landmass, without the fear of any regional rivals developing to either the North or the South

190
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:17,200
in Canada or Mexico, largely because the geography of both these regions to the South and the North

191
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:24,400
cannot support nearly as powerful, nor as populous an empire as the land in the middle

192
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,760
that is presently controlled by the United States. After the United States invaded,

193
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,240
conquered, and annexed half of Mexico back in the 1840s, the largely mountainous lands that Mexico

194
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,480
was left with didn't contain even a single naturally navigable river within the interior,

195
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,200
and only a single good natural port on the coastline at Veracruz. In addition, what agricultural

196
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,680
areas Mexico had left were relegated within the many valleys crisscrossing in between the mountains,

197
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,160
leading them to be highly separated from all the other agricultural areas of the country,

198
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,560
which is completely opposite of the enormously interconnected agricultural geography further

199
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:13,120
to the North in the United States. And then in Canada, the vastness of the Canadian Shield,

200
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:20,800
a cold region where glaciation over eons of time has stripped the area of most of its usable soil,

201
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:26,240
making it useless for agriculture, stretches across half the entire country between the

202
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,920
Great Lakes and the Arctic Ocean, and separates the small, agriculturally productive core of

203
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,360
Canadian civilization around Toronto and Montreal from the prairie provinces in British Columbia

204
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,000
over to the West. Without any internally navigable rivers between them to rely upon,

205
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,800
like much of the United States, there is still, to this day, only a single road that connects

206
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,560
all four of these provinces west of the Canadian Shield to the core of Canadian civilization to

207
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,160
the east of the Shield. And this means that, inevitably, the four Canadian provinces west

208
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:06,080
of the Shield are significantly more economically integrated with the United States to the south

209
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,600
than with the rest of Canada to the east, because it's far easier to actually travel south and

210
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,560
access America's vastly superior transportation network. Therefore, as the fate of geography

211
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:25,440
would have it, the core region of North America's insane productivity and easy transportation is

212
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:32,640
also one of the most secure locations of its kind anywhere on the planet, far removed from any

213
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:40,240
potential major rivals or threats. And this, in essence, is the secret sauce of America's enormous

214
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:47,520
geopolitical strength. Incredibly easy transportation within the core, combined with incredibly

215
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:54,080
difficult transportation beyond it. Not only can no rivals easily develop within North America to

216
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,560
threaten the core, but two enormous oceans separate the core from all other continents as well,

217
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:06,560
essentially transforming the United States into an island empire, but of continental scale.

218
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:12,960
Oceans are incredibly difficult for invading militaries to travel across. In 1940, with the

219
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,960
domination of continental Europe, Adolf Hitler had to cancel the invasion of England across the

220
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,040
English Channel because it was proving too logistically difficult for the Nazi war machine

221
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:33,120
to pull off. And that channel is only 33 kilometers wide at the narrowest point. The shortest distance

222
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,680
between the United States and Europe is nearly 5,000 kilometers across the open ocean, and it's

223
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:46,880
even further away from Asia across the vast and empty Pacific. So, as a result, the core of the

224
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,600
United States has never been invaded by a hostile foreign power in more than two centuries since

225
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:01,360
the British in 1815, because it's largely impossible to actually do so, especially when

226
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,680
considering that the United States also controls half of the naval tonnage of all the world's

227
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:15,200
navies and dominates the entirety of the world's oceans. And even if, somehow, a foreign power was

228
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,040
capable of miraculously overcoming the largest, most capable, and most technologically advanced

229
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:27,600
navy in human history, and then transporting and supplying hundreds of thousands to millions of

230
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,840
troops across thousands of kilometers of open ocean and landing them on the beaches of North America,

231
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,360
it still wouldn't even really matter, because the North American continent has,

232
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:46,000
essentially, all of the resources required for modern civilization and modern militaries

233
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,920
located deep within it. This is the other huge key to the power of the modern United States,

234
00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:00,480
North America's raw geologic potential. For many decades, the specter of over-dependence

235
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,840
on other nations and other continents for their energy resources towered over the minds of America's

236
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:14,080
most strategic planners. Though it was once the largest producer and exporter of oil in the world

237
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,920
throughout the early 20th century, and provided nearly six out of seven of all the barrels of

238
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:27,200
oil used by the allies of World War II, America's days as a major oil-producing nation were believed

239
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:34,320
to be ending by the mid-1970s, as demand rapidly outpaced production in the post-World War II boom

240
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,880
economy. By 1973, with a country importing more than a third of its entire oil supply from abroad,

241
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,760
the United States was suddenly especially vulnerable to international oil embargoes coming from OPEC,

242
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,800
the organization of petroleum exporting countries, consisting of countries across the Middle East,

243
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:59,760
Africa, and Venezuela. At that time, the countries of OPEC represented half of all the oil

244
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,880
production in the world, and their decision to embargo the United States due to their support

245
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,760
of Israel during the Yom Kippur War shut them out from that half of the world supply, and caused

246
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,560
American energy prices to skyrocket. Later on, after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran,

247
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,640
the United States became shut out from that country's entire rich supply of oil as well.

248
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,080
And as the demand for oil within the United States continued to increase throughout the 20th

249
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,960
century, and with domestic production never capable of catching up, America found itself

250
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:43,600
in a position where, by 2005, the country was importing a whopping 60% of its oil supply from

251
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,360
abroad, an amount that is percentage-wise highly similar to what China imports today.

252
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,960
As a consequence, American foreign policy was, for decades in the later 20th century,

253
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,960
dominated and constrained by this heavy dependence on the outside world for its oil supplies.

254
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,800
But, beginning in the early 21st century, a revolution in the oil and gas industry back at

255
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:13,920
home would permanently change this reality with profound and still unknown consequences.

256
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,800
Technological and economic innovations in drilling technology and techniques now known as

257
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:25,600
fracking were finally unlocking the ability of oil and gas companies to economically crack the

258
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,400
hydrocarbon code of shale rock, which had remained elusive for more than a century beforehand.

259
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,680
Beginning in Texas as recently as 1998 within a region known as the Barnett around Dallas,

260
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,920
Fort Worth, the news that shale rock could be economically harvested for oil and gas began

261
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:52,480
to rapidly spread like wildfire. These new shale discoveries revealed that Texas possessed many

262
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,640
of the largest oil and gas fields known anywhere in the world, like the Eagle Ford in the south

263
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,960
that became the fifth largest known oil field just behind the enormous Bergen field in Kuwait,

264
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,480
an area located in the Permian basin of West Texas known as the Spratberry and Wolf Camp that is

265
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:18,000
now considered the second largest oil field in the world, remaining only behind the mighty

266
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,440
Gavar field that forms the backbone of Saudi Arabia's oil mites. In the span of just a single

267
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:33,360
decade, this new reality and these enormous discoveries rocketed Texan oil production five

268
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:40,800
fold to make the state a larger oil producer than every single country in OPEC besides Saudi

269
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:50,160
Arabia itself. And today, Texas alone produces 45% of the United States' entire domestic oil

270
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,560
production and if it were an independent country, Texas would be the world's fourth largest oil

271
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:02,800
producer behind only the rest of the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia. And of course,

272
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:09,120
it's not just Texas that produces a ton of oil and gas now for the United States. There was also

273
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,200
the shale play in the back-and-field of North Dakota that suddenly transformed that isolated

274
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,760
central state into America's second largest oil producer only behind Texas. There's also the

275
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,840
vast oil and gas fields in the offshore of the Gulf of Mexico, the North Slope of Alaska and what

276
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,920
could ultimately prove to potentially become the largest natural gas field ever discovered

277
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,800
anywhere in the world. The enormous Marcellus field one to two miles beneath the ground spanning

278
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:48,080
across upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. All told, these new discoveries

279
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:55,600
tripled the estimated natural gas reserves of the United States between 2002 and 2019 and with a

280
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,720
massive network constructed of new gas pipelines stretching across the border into Mexico,

281
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,240
accompanied by a series of liquefied natural gas or LNG export terminals across the Gulf Coast,

282
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:13,440
Maryland and Alaska. The United States suddenly transformed out of nowhere into the second largest

283
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:21,600
exporter of natural gas behind only the Russians. And by 2018, what had previously been unimaginable

284
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:29,760
back in the days between the 1970s and 2005 finally happened. The United States had once again for the

285
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:37,920
first time in more than four decades surpassed both Saudi Arabia and Russia to regain its title

286
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:44,240
as the world's number one producer of oil, a position that the United States will now almost

287
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,480
certainly retain for all of the foreseeable future. And perhaps most importantly, the vast

288
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:57,280
shale basins of the United States are all located within the interior of the continent and nearby

289
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,200
to major navigable water-based transportation routes. And the network of U.S. oil and gas

290
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:10,400
pipelines and refineries is simultaneously so vast they span across nearly the entire continent as

291
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:19,280
well. Effectively, this has largely made the United States an empire that is mostly capable of true

292
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:25,760
energy independence. No longer reliant on the complicated geopolitics of the outside world

293
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:32,400
for supplies necessary to power modern civilization. For economic reasons, the United States continues

294
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,280
to import large amounts of oil from abroad, but primarily from within the North American

295
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:44,720
continent she so thoroughly dominates. Canada and Mexico alone provide for around 60 percent

296
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,840
of all the imported oil used within the United States today. No longer can oil embargoes from

297
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,840
any coalition of nations outside of North America threaten the American supply of energy,

298
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,200
and nor can a naval blockade of America's energy imports that primarily come in from overland from

299
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,640
other parts of the continent's interior. Combined, these geographic and geologic strengths add

300
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,320
together to make the United States the most formidable global power of the 21st century

301
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,800
and human history. But it doesn't mean that the country is completely immune to external attack

302
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:26,320
and without weakness. Even though the United States is now largely energy independent in

303
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:32,320
terms of oil and gas, the country continues to maintain an extremely heavy presence across the

304
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,560
oil and gas-rich Middle East. Not because it directly relies on oil and gas from there for

305
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:45,600
themselves, but because the resources of the Middle East are absolutely central to the wider global

306
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:52,800
economy at large, and vital for many of the United States' most significant allies in East Asia.

307
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:58,560
Any disruption in the flow of oil and gas out of the Middle East through the Strait of Hormuz

308
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:04,160
would be incredibly destructive to the world economy, a world economy that the United States

309
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:10,640
has found itself increasingly integrated and interconnected with today. As much as 30 percent

310
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:18,720
of the entire modern U.S. GDP and nearly 40 million American jobs stem from this interconnected

311
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,280
web of trade with the rest of the world, which means that to a large extent, the United States

312
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:32,320
is in fact still dependent on the rest of the world, and especially the region of the world

313
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:40,560
that most powers it, the Middle East. This is why in 1991, decades before the Shale Revolution,

314
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:47,520
the United States was so swift to destroy the army of Saddam Hussein after he led Iraq into

315
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:53,520
invading and conquering neighboring Kuwait. By seizing control of Kuwait, Saddam found himself

316
00:32:53,520 --> 00:33:00,400
personally in control of more than 20 percent of the entire world's supply of oil known at the time.

317
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,120
After mobilizing his army on the borders of Saudi Arabia immediately afterwards,

318
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,760
it appeared clear that he was going to invade that country as well and seize control over their

319
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,080
oil fields, catapulting him into possession of 45 percent of the world's known supply of oil,

320
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,800
which effectively would have made Saddam Hussein the master of oil's price and supply across the

321
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:30,160
planet. Unwilling to tolerate that threat to the global economy, the United States mobilized the

322
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:37,200
largest coalition of nations ever seen since the Second World War and went to war against his army,

323
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,960
liberating Kuwait and pushing Iraqi forces back across the border. But by doing so,

324
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,440
the United States committed to basing large numbers of troops in Saudi Arabia nearby to the

325
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,440
front line, and they didn't leave following the war's conclusion. Combined with the U.S.'s

326
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,880
financial support for the Saudi regime, the harsh economic sanctions imposed on Iraq following the

327
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,760
end of the war and the staunch American support for Israel, these events all contributed to Osama

328
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,800
bin Laden and his al-Qaeda organization to attack the United States directly in the deadliest single

329
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:22,880
attack ever perpetrated against the American heartland on September the 11th, 2001. In response,

330
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,560
the United States initiated the war on terror and subsequently invaded the landlocked

331
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,400
mountainous Afghanistan where the local Taliban regime was shielding bin Laden and al-Qaeda,

332
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:40,960
and so began what would ultimately transform into the longest war in American history that would

333
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,920
last for the next 20 grueling years, and ultimately after more than two decades of fighting that cost

334
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:56,080
more than $2 trillion and over 140,000 lives across the country, the United States ultimately

335
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:04,560
decided to withdraw almost exactly one year ago back in August of 2021, culminating in an ultimate

336
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,440
Taliban resurgence that swept over the country and catapulted them back into power yet again.

337
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,600
As with Vietnam decades before it, the war in landlocked mountainous Afghanistan ultimately

338
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:25,840
became a decisive foreign policy defeat for the United States and explicitly showcased that even

339
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:32,960
the most powerful empire in human history has its limitations. As the war in Afghanistan encompassed

340
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:40,960
more than 8% of the entirety of American history and spanned across more than two-thirds of my own

341
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:48,960
lifetime and many other Americans and Afghans alike, this conflict is perhaps the most critical

342
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:59,040
and important of all 21st century wars for us to understand in both countries how and why it began,

343
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,640
why it lasted for so long, and what lessons can be learned from it both within America,

344
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,280
Afghanistan, and the rest of the world. But unfortunately, if I made an in-depth video

345
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,840
about the war in Afghanistan here on YouTube, the many disturbing, violent, and controversial

346
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:26,320
details of discussing a very recent and horrible conflict would cause the video to become demonetized

347
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:33,280
and age-restricted, which I completely understand and believe is appropriate, but it ultimately

348
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:39,520
means that YouTube's algorithm would never promote the video to you, and there's just simply no way

349
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,360
that you would ever see it here, and that's why instead I created yet another full-length

350
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,800
companion video to this one in my ongoing modern conflict series that's about the exact same

351
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,720
length as this video that covers the entire course and explanation into America's war in

352
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:04,560
Afghanistan from the very beginning in 2001 to the very end in 2021 and uploaded it directly to

353
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:11,680
Nebula, which as I'm sure you've probably heard by now is home to tons of exclusive ad-free content

354
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,600
like my entire modern conflict series, with 16 other full-length videos containing more than

355
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:23,760
five and a half hours worth of additional combined content that you can go and watch right now,

356
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,080
covering more than a dozen recent major wars and conflicts that'll help you stay

357
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:33,920
up to date on what's going on in our world and why. From this video covering all of the events

358
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,600
leading up to Russia's recent decision to invade Ukraine, to this one covering the ongoing Chinese

359
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:45,680
genocide of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, this one covering the 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia,

360
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:52,480
and many more. Of course, the reason why all of these videos are only available on Nebula is because

361
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,920
they just wouldn't ever work here on YouTube, and would never be able to be viewed because of the

362
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,240
way this site works in relation to highly controversial and sensitive recent events. On the other hand,

363
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,920
Nebula is a totally different platform without an algorithm and without any ads. It's just a

364
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,400
platform about great and unique content made by great and independent educational creators,

365
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,520
with plenty of other unique, exclusive bonus projects from other creators you probably already

366
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:27,280
know like Real Engineering's incredible World War II era, Battle of Britain, and Logistics of

367
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,320
D-Day series, and multiple hour-plus long documentaries from Wendover Productions.

368
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,160
The best way to get access to Nebula and all of this incredible exclusive content is absolutely

369
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,640
through the truly amazing CuriosityStream Nebula Bundle Deal, and with its current sales price,

370
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:51,360
it's less than $15 a year to get full access to both sites. And CuriosityStream has some

371
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:57,840
pretty awesome stuff that you're definitely going to enjoy as well, like Afghanistan 1979,

372
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:03,280
an hour-long documentary covering the entire history of the Soviet Union's invasion and

373
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,600
occupation of Afghanistan throughout the 1980s, explaining in-depth all of the background information

374
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:16,240
that you need to know before watching my video on Nebula covering America's invasion and occupation

375
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,960
just over a decade after the Soviets left. I really can't recommend it enough, and I genuinely

376
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,640
don't know about a better deal that exists anywhere in streaming. You get two streaming sites,

377
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:36,720
both with content you'll actually watch, and all for less than $15 a year at the current sales price.

378
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,880
But what's even more, signing up will actually help countless independent educational creators
