41120	48080	The United States of America is the most powerful empire that has ever existed in human history,
48080	52960	without even being the absolute largest in terms of overall territory.
52960	59360	No other empire has ever been as capable of so thoroughly enforcing its will across the rest of
59360	64960	the planet. Economically, the United States has continuously remained the world's largest economy
64960	71760	since the 1890s, and is the only country that has ended every single decade with a larger economy
71760	78640	than it started with for the past 150 years. The US dollar is the primary reserve currency
78640	83920	used by most of the world's nations. America's government is the second longest continuously
83920	90400	run regime in the world. And despite making up just 5% of the contemporary human population,
90400	97920	the United States controls around 30% of the entire planet's wealth, and produces 20%
97920	104480	of all global manufacturing. And complimenting America's tremendous economic might is also
104480	112560	her unprecedented military strength. The US military alone represents nearly 40% of all
112560	118720	worldwide military spending. The US Navy represents half of the worldwide naval fleet.
118720	125040	The United States controls more than 750 overseas military bases across every conceivable theater
125040	130160	of the world, enabling America to attack any threat anywhere on the surface of the planet
130160	136400	in less than 48 hours. And while there are many factors that contribute towards this
136400	142560	unprecedented global power and influence of the United States, the biggest reason for it,
142560	148800	and the true source from which all American power stems, is the fact that the geography
148800	156000	and the geology of the North American continent itself is just insanely overpowered from a
156080	162640	civilization-building standpoint. In fact, it's so outrageously overpowered that it's not even
162640	169520	really fair to any of Earth's other civilizational start points, and it was almost inevitable that
169520	176320	any civilization that began where the United States did, regardless of people or ideology,
176320	182800	would have eventually emerged as the dominant global superpower. So allow me to explain,
182800	189280	in depth, why that's the case. To begin with, the core geographic reason of America's global
189280	195600	power and the core of the North American continent itself is almost certainly the Mississippi River,
195600	201200	and the vast basin that surrounds it wedged in between the high Rocky Mountains in the West,
201200	205360	and the low Appalachian Mountains in the East, interconnecting with the Illinois,
205360	211760	Ohio, Tennessee, Red, Arkansas, and Missouri rivers as well. Most of the tributary rivers that feed
211760	218000	into this enormous system spanning one third of the entire continent begin at relatively low
218000	223280	elevations, which effectively means that the majority of the basin's rivers are calm and
223280	229120	absent of any obstacles like rapids, and have therefore been easily navigable for thousands
229120	234880	of years without the need for any advanced technology, expensive development, or infrastructure.
234880	240080	The most important thing to understand about the Mississippi River itself is that it is the
240080	245600	longest navigable river in the world, meaning that since time immemorial,
245600	250560	anyone could essentially sail a boat carrying supplies or people from the Gulf of Mexico
250560	256720	into the Mississippi's mouth and up more than 3,000 kilometers deep into the North American
256720	263040	interior before hitting the river's only natural waterfall here, which, without coincidence,
263040	267920	is exactly where the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul was settled. The navigable section
267920	272640	of the Mississippi River from these waterfalls, down to the Delta in the Gulf of Mexico, is more
272640	278400	than three times the length of the Rhine in Europe, and a third longer than even the Danube,
278400	282800	Europe's second longest river. Navigable rivers like the Mississippi or the Rhine
282800	289040	are tremendously valuable to generating economic activity, because they are substantially cheaper
289040	295040	to use as transportation of goods and people than land-based infrastructure. Roads and railways require
295040	300320	not only high initial costs to construct, but high ongoing maintenance costs to keep them
300320	307600	functioning and running as well, whereas rivers are already there and are basically just free to use.
307600	313200	The only costs involve creating ports and boats to carry stuff up and down them, and as a result
313200	319760	of that, shipping products by water as opposed to land is anywhere from 10 to 30 times less
319760	325600	expensive in the modern 21st century era, and civilizations who have more navigable rivers
325600	331280	will be able to retain substantially higher amounts of profits from all the capital that
331280	337280	they'll be saving on transportation costs. This fact instantly makes the Mississippi River,
337280	343520	as the longest navigable river in the world, tremendously economically valuable to anybody
343600	350240	who controls it. Farms and factories built along or nearby the 3,000 kilometers of its banks between
350240	355600	the Delta and the Gulf of Mexico, and the waterfalls at Minneapolis St. Paul, are capable of cheaply
355600	361840	exporting their products further downstream and out into the world ocean toward global markets.
361840	368880	But the Mississippi River itself is only the main stem of the overall greater network of
368880	374640	navigable rivers found across the greater Mississippi basin, granting settlements as deep
374640	379760	into the interior of North America as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Minneapolis, Chicago, Sioux City,
379760	386640	St. Louis, Memphis, Muscogee, Shreveport, and more to effectively become oceanic ports,
386640	392480	all capable of exporting their various products cheaply down the Mississippi River network
392480	399840	towards the Gulf of Mexico. But it isn't just this uniquely vast system of internally
399840	406320	navigable rivers within North America that give this continent such an advantage to commerce.
406320	413040	It's also the fact that around much of North America exists another highly unique geographic
413040	420160	feature that cannot be found anywhere else in anywhere near such a useful pattern. The many,
420160	425760	many barrier islands that exist in an almost continuously uninterrupted chain for more than
425760	433680	4,800 kilometers, around three-fourths of the U.S. Gulf and East Coasts. From the southernmost tip
433680	439120	of Texas where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf, up to the Chesapeake Bay that harbors Washington
439120	445920	D.C. and Baltimore. In effect, these countless low and flat islands have transformed what would
445920	453120	otherwise be 4,800 kilometers of exposed coastline into a network of protected shielded bays that
453120	459840	can be effectively utilized as a sort of oceanic river, relatively navigable all the way from
459840	465360	Brownsville, Texas to Baltimore, Maryland. And since the Delta of the Mississippi River empties
465360	471200	out directly into this further navigable network, it means that goods have been able to be cheaply,
471200	477440	reliably, and quickly transported from all throughout the North American interior to all
477440	483760	across the Gulf and East Coast now for hundreds of years. When collectively added together,
483760	489840	the internal rivers of the Mississippi basin and this external intracostal waterway wrapping
489840	497760	around the Gulf and East Coasts account for nearly 25,000 kilometers of combined navigable
497760	503680	waterways, which is not only more than the rest of North America combined, but more than the rest
503680	511120	of the entire planet combined. The end result is the greatest natural transportation system to be
511120	517680	found anywhere in the world. An enormous network of freely available riverine superhighways that
517680	526000	causes 90 percent of the lower continental 48 United States to be within just 240 kilometers
526000	531680	of an easily navigable waterway. And it was all just effectively given to the United States more
531680	538560	than two centuries ago, back in 1803, when the French decided to sell all of it for about $340
538560	546080	million in today's currency valuation. And then the power that the system of natural navigation
546080	553760	offers the United States is even further exacerbated when you consider that it spans across what also
553760	560480	just so happens to be the largest contiguous stretch of arable farmland on the planet as well,
560480	564240	the American Midwest. The westernmost portion of the Midwest,
564240	568960	located within the rain shadow cast by the towering Rocky Mountains of the continent,
568960	574160	is dry but temperate and perfect for growing wheat like Ukraine and southern Russia,
574160	579040	while the central portion is temperate and humid, perfect for growing corn and soybeans.
579040	584960	Today, an area more than twice the size of France is under till within the Midwest alone.
584960	591120	And as a result, this region produces nearly a third of the entire planet's supply of corn
591120	598400	and soybeans, and more than $150 billion worth of agricultural produce overall per year.
598400	606800	And all of this enormous agricultural land happens to also roughly overlap with the world's largest
606800	613920	network of easily navigable rivers. It is a perfect, natural recipe for an agricultural
613920	619360	superpower to develop from. And when further considering the fact that the Intracoastal
619360	624800	Waterway Network further services the transportation needs of everything from Texas to Maryland,
624800	629200	the Colombian Snake Rivers flow through the agricultural zones of the Pacific Northwest,
629200	634240	and the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento River help out within the Central Valley of California,
634240	641840	you can quickly see that with very few exceptions, the vast majority of all of America's agricultural
641840	647200	regions are within just 240 kilometers of a navigable waterway to the ocean,
647200	653280	enabling food grown across the rural parts of the continent to easily and cheaply be transported
653280	659040	to the same continent's urban population centers in a way that simply no other continent on the
659120	665360	Earth could ever match. And we're still pretty much just at the beginning here of explaining
665360	672720	the sheer scale of North America's geographic advantages towards maritime power and commerce,
672720	678560	because you also have to consider the many, many natural indentations of the continental coastline
678560	685520	itself that creates many of the greatest natural oceanic deep water harbors in the world. In order
685520	692480	for a natural harbor to make a good port, they must really have three crucial ingredients, deep
692480	696960	passages for shipping, enough resources in the immediate hinderland to support cities that can
696960	702800	support the port, and plenty of coastal frontage area. When only considering natural harbors
702800	708240	across the world that possess all three of those critical factors, the top three largest of them
708240	714800	are all within continental North America and controlled by the United States outright.
714800	719440	The Chesapeake Bay between Maryland and Virginia, the San Francisco Bay surrounded by California,
719440	725120	and the Puget Sound of Washington State. These three are arguably the most impressive
725120	730960	natural harbors found anywhere on the surface of the Earth, while the Chesapeake Bay itself,
730960	739040	all on its own, has a longer coastline than the entirety of India combined. When added together,
739040	745360	the entire coastline of the modern United States is well over three and a half times the length
745360	752320	of the entire African continent, despite the fact that Africa itself is more than three times larger
752320	758000	than the United States in terms of overall land. This means that the United States coastline on
758000	764240	the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific has a greater overall potential for ports than any other country
764240	770560	on the Earth, bar none, and can even fit in significantly more ports than entire other
770560	775600	continents are capable of. And then there's also the fact that with a little modern civil
775600	782320	engineering, the United States acquired a second enormous internal navigable waterway in the mid-20th
782320	788240	century, the Great Lakes. Due to the fact that the Great Lakes are naturally full of rapids like,
788240	793200	you know, Niagara Falls, and the fact that the connections between the lakes often freeze over
793200	798640	during the winter, they were never naturally navigable on their own all the way through history
798640	803920	until the very late 1950s, when a series of locks and canals were completed by the Americans and
803920	809040	Canadians. Now, the Great Lakes serve as a complementary internal water transportation
809040	815200	system to the Mississippi basin and intercoastal waterway, enabling even further cities deep within
815200	821680	the continent to effectively become oceanic ports from Duluth to Detroit to Cleveland and Buffalo.
821680	826320	And then there's the fact that through a series of artificial canals, the Mississippi
826320	831440	basin system and the Great Lakes system are now connected with each other, and barges can
831440	837600	effectively freely navigate with their cargoes in a giant circle around the entire eastern
837600	845360	United States. But great as it is, the Mississippi basin does contain a couple of critical geographic
845360	852320	vulnerabilities that can be exploited by America's enemies and both revolve essentially around New
852320	859600	Orleans, the most strategically important city in the entire United States. Because it serves as
859600	866000	the gates between the entire Mississippi River Super Highway Network and the intercoastal waterway
866000	872000	and Gulf of Mexico. Should New Orleans ever fall into enemy hands or be somehow destroyed,
872000	877520	the link between the greatest river network for transportation in the world and the global ocean
877520	883760	would be blocked. And the whole system, along with the American economy, would effectively
883760	890000	break down. And there are theoretically two arguably easier ways to accomplish this, besides
890000	896080	from capturing or destroying New Orleans itself. The first way is to take advantage of Cuba. You
896080	901600	see, Cuba is probably the most strategically valuable piece of the North American board that
901680	908080	the United States doesn't outright control or have significant influence over. This is because
908080	914320	of the way the island juts into the Gulf of Mexico. Creating two straits that all ships coming back
914320	920960	and forth through the Gulf and the greater world ocean have no other choice but to pass through.
920960	927040	The Florida straits in the North or the Yucatan strait in the South. All on its own, Cuba is too
927040	932480	small of an island to ever leverage the strategic position to threaten the trade of America's
932480	937520	underbelly between New Orleans, the Mississippi basin, the intercoastal waterway, and the outside
937520	944880	world. But when placed under the sway of a major power from another continent, it absolutely can
944880	950480	be, as nearly happened during the early 1960s, when the Soviet Union began placing nuclear
950480	956320	missiles and troops there. Cuba can hypothetically be utilized as a springboard to attack the United
956320	962240	States' most significant geographic advantage. And as a result, Washington has been actively
962240	969280	carrying out the longest trade embargo of modern history against the island for more than 60 years
969280	975280	now, desperately hoping to bend its people towards its will and to prevent any large,
975280	982240	hostile foreign power from ever becoming too established there. The other incredible weakness
982240	989280	is almost paradoxically the Mississippi River itself, which has desperately wanted to change
989280	995920	its course now for decades. For thousands of years now, the Mississippi River has always meandered
995920	1001920	around over long periods of time, and its delta has shifted across various positions along the
1001920	1007680	Louisiana Gulf coast. Back in the 1970s, the river would have naturally shifted course away from its
1007760	1013440	current path, beginning in a location that hardly anyone will have ever heard of, the small town of
1013440	1018640	Vidalia, Louisiana. From here, the Mississippi would have begun flowing into what's currently
1018640	1025280	known as the Achafalaya River, down to a new delta in the Gulf about 120 kilometers southwest of
1025280	1031200	present-day New Orleans. Had this been naturally allowed to happen, the entire Mississippi River
1031200	1036640	would have diverted completely around the cities of Baton Rouge and New Orleans, leaving their
1036640	1041520	river-based infrastructure stranded and their people without any source of freshwater, and
1041520	1047520	creating a new delta for the river in an area that is presently, essentially, the middle of nowhere.
1047520	1053440	The end result would have been an economic catastrophe for the United States of unprecedented
1053440	1059120	proportions. And so, in anticipation, the United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed what
1059120	1066400	is probably their proudest accomplishment. The $2 billion old river control structure
1066400	1071840	within the small town of Vidalia, which artificially forces the Mississippi River to
1071840	1077520	unwillingly continue down its historical path towards Baton Rouge and New Orleans,
1077520	1082000	where all the infrastructure built up over centuries is actually located.
1082000	1088000	But should this structure ever somehow fail in the future, the mighty Mississippi would almost
1088000	1094880	immediately and violently snap courses to flood down the Achafalaya towards the Gulf instead,
1094880	1101120	flooding everything in its path and effectively destroying the utility of all America's industrial
1101120	1107520	and agricultural processing infrastructure between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, and temporarily
1107520	1113360	shutting down most of the Mississippi Basin's superhighway system until new infrastructure
1113360	1119680	could be built down in the new delta. These weaknesses, though, are essentially only hypothetical.
1119680	1125360	The fact is that the land where the United States is placed in is the best suited location in the
1125360	1132640	entire world for a civilization to develop into a colossally capable maritime empire,
1132640	1138400	for all the reasons that I've already explained, and for many more. For example, there's also the
1138400	1144240	fact that for centuries now, the United States has been capable of developing within this continental
1144320	1150640	sized landmass, without the fear of any regional rivals developing to either the North or the South
1150640	1157200	in Canada or Mexico, largely because the geography of both these regions to the South and the North
1157200	1164400	cannot support nearly as powerful, nor as populous an empire as the land in the middle
1164400	1169760	that is presently controlled by the United States. After the United States invaded,
1169760	1176240	conquered, and annexed half of Mexico back in the 1840s, the largely mountainous lands that Mexico
1176240	1182480	was left with didn't contain even a single naturally navigable river within the interior,
1182480	1189200	and only a single good natural port on the coastline at Veracruz. In addition, what agricultural
1189200	1195680	areas Mexico had left were relegated within the many valleys crisscrossing in between the mountains,
1195680	1200160	leading them to be highly separated from all the other agricultural areas of the country,
1200160	1206560	which is completely opposite of the enormously interconnected agricultural geography further
1206560	1213120	to the North in the United States. And then in Canada, the vastness of the Canadian Shield,
1213120	1220800	a cold region where glaciation over eons of time has stripped the area of most of its usable soil,
1220800	1226240	making it useless for agriculture, stretches across half the entire country between the
1226240	1231920	Great Lakes and the Arctic Ocean, and separates the small, agriculturally productive core of
1231920	1237360	Canadian civilization around Toronto and Montreal from the prairie provinces in British Columbia
1237360	1242000	over to the West. Without any internally navigable rivers between them to rely upon,
1242000	1248800	like much of the United States, there is still, to this day, only a single road that connects
1248800	1254560	all four of these provinces west of the Canadian Shield to the core of Canadian civilization to
1254560	1260160	the east of the Shield. And this means that, inevitably, the four Canadian provinces west
1260160	1266080	of the Shield are significantly more economically integrated with the United States to the south
1266080	1271600	than with the rest of Canada to the east, because it's far easier to actually travel south and
1271600	1278560	access America's vastly superior transportation network. Therefore, as the fate of geography
1278560	1285440	would have it, the core region of North America's insane productivity and easy transportation is
1285440	1292640	also one of the most secure locations of its kind anywhere on the planet, far removed from any
1292640	1300240	potential major rivals or threats. And this, in essence, is the secret sauce of America's enormous
1300240	1307520	geopolitical strength. Incredibly easy transportation within the core, combined with incredibly
1307520	1314080	difficult transportation beyond it. Not only can no rivals easily develop within North America to
1314080	1320560	threaten the core, but two enormous oceans separate the core from all other continents as well,
1320560	1326560	essentially transforming the United States into an island empire, but of continental scale.
1326560	1332960	Oceans are incredibly difficult for invading militaries to travel across. In 1940, with the
1332960	1338960	domination of continental Europe, Adolf Hitler had to cancel the invasion of England across the
1338960	1345040	English Channel because it was proving too logistically difficult for the Nazi war machine
1345040	1353120	to pull off. And that channel is only 33 kilometers wide at the narrowest point. The shortest distance
1353120	1359680	between the United States and Europe is nearly 5,000 kilometers across the open ocean, and it's
1359680	1366880	even further away from Asia across the vast and empty Pacific. So, as a result, the core of the
1366880	1373600	United States has never been invaded by a hostile foreign power in more than two centuries since
1373600	1381360	the British in 1815, because it's largely impossible to actually do so, especially when
1381360	1387680	considering that the United States also controls half of the naval tonnage of all the world's
1387680	1395200	navies and dominates the entirety of the world's oceans. And even if, somehow, a foreign power was
1395200	1401040	capable of miraculously overcoming the largest, most capable, and most technologically advanced
1401040	1407600	navy in human history, and then transporting and supplying hundreds of thousands to millions of
1407600	1413840	troops across thousands of kilometers of open ocean and landing them on the beaches of North America,
1413840	1419360	it still wouldn't even really matter, because the North American continent has,
1419360	1426000	essentially, all of the resources required for modern civilization and modern militaries
1426000	1433920	located deep within it. This is the other huge key to the power of the modern United States,
1433920	1440480	North America's raw geologic potential. For many decades, the specter of over-dependence
1440480	1447840	on other nations and other continents for their energy resources towered over the minds of America's
1447840	1454080	most strategic planners. Though it was once the largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
1454080	1459920	throughout the early 20th century, and provided nearly six out of seven of all the barrels of
1459920	1467200	oil used by the allies of World War II, America's days as a major oil-producing nation were believed
1467200	1474320	to be ending by the mid-1970s, as demand rapidly outpaced production in the post-World War II boom
1474320	1480880	economy. By 1973, with a country importing more than a third of its entire oil supply from abroad,
1480880	1487760	the United States was suddenly especially vulnerable to international oil embargoes coming from OPEC,
1487760	1492800	the organization of petroleum exporting countries, consisting of countries across the Middle East,
1492800	1499760	Africa, and Venezuela. At that time, the countries of OPEC represented half of all the oil
1499760	1504880	production in the world, and their decision to embargo the United States due to their support
1504880	1511760	of Israel during the Yom Kippur War shut them out from that half of the world supply, and caused
1511760	1518560	American energy prices to skyrocket. Later on, after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran,
1518560	1524640	the United States became shut out from that country's entire rich supply of oil as well.
1524640	1530080	And as the demand for oil within the United States continued to increase throughout the 20th
1530080	1534960	century, and with domestic production never capable of catching up, America found itself
1534960	1543600	in a position where, by 2005, the country was importing a whopping 60% of its oil supply from
1543600	1549360	abroad, an amount that is percentage-wise highly similar to what China imports today.
1549360	1554960	As a consequence, American foreign policy was, for decades in the later 20th century,
1554960	1560960	dominated and constrained by this heavy dependence on the outside world for its oil supplies.
1560960	1566800	But, beginning in the early 21st century, a revolution in the oil and gas industry back at
1566800	1573920	home would permanently change this reality with profound and still unknown consequences.
1573920	1578800	Technological and economic innovations in drilling technology and techniques now known as
1578800	1585600	fracking were finally unlocking the ability of oil and gas companies to economically crack the
1585600	1592400	hydrocarbon code of shale rock, which had remained elusive for more than a century beforehand.
1592400	1597680	Beginning in Texas as recently as 1998 within a region known as the Barnett around Dallas,
1597680	1603920	Fort Worth, the news that shale rock could be economically harvested for oil and gas began
1603920	1612480	to rapidly spread like wildfire. These new shale discoveries revealed that Texas possessed many
1612480	1618640	of the largest oil and gas fields known anywhere in the world, like the Eagle Ford in the south
1618640	1624960	that became the fifth largest known oil field just behind the enormous Bergen field in Kuwait,
1624960	1630480	an area located in the Permian basin of West Texas known as the Spratberry and Wolf Camp that is
1630480	1638000	now considered the second largest oil field in the world, remaining only behind the mighty
1638000	1645440	Gavar field that forms the backbone of Saudi Arabia's oil mites. In the span of just a single
1645440	1653360	decade, this new reality and these enormous discoveries rocketed Texan oil production five
1653360	1660800	fold to make the state a larger oil producer than every single country in OPEC besides Saudi
1660800	1670160	Arabia itself. And today, Texas alone produces 45% of the United States' entire domestic oil
1670880	1676560	production and if it were an independent country, Texas would be the world's fourth largest oil
1676560	1682800	producer behind only the rest of the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia. And of course,
1682800	1689120	it's not just Texas that produces a ton of oil and gas now for the United States. There was also
1689120	1695200	the shale play in the back-and-field of North Dakota that suddenly transformed that isolated
1695200	1701760	central state into America's second largest oil producer only behind Texas. There's also the
1701760	1707840	vast oil and gas fields in the offshore of the Gulf of Mexico, the North Slope of Alaska and what
1707840	1713920	could ultimately prove to potentially become the largest natural gas field ever discovered
1713920	1720800	anywhere in the world. The enormous Marcellus field one to two miles beneath the ground spanning
1720800	1728080	across upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. All told, these new discoveries
1728080	1735600	tripled the estimated natural gas reserves of the United States between 2002 and 2019 and with a
1735600	1740720	massive network constructed of new gas pipelines stretching across the border into Mexico,
1740720	1746240	accompanied by a series of liquefied natural gas or LNG export terminals across the Gulf Coast,
1746240	1753440	Maryland and Alaska. The United States suddenly transformed out of nowhere into the second largest
1753440	1761600	exporter of natural gas behind only the Russians. And by 2018, what had previously been unimaginable
1761600	1769760	back in the days between the 1970s and 2005 finally happened. The United States had once again for the
1769760	1777920	first time in more than four decades surpassed both Saudi Arabia and Russia to regain its title
1777920	1784240	as the world's number one producer of oil, a position that the United States will now almost
1784240	1790480	certainly retain for all of the foreseeable future. And perhaps most importantly, the vast
1790480	1797280	shale basins of the United States are all located within the interior of the continent and nearby
1797280	1803200	to major navigable water-based transportation routes. And the network of U.S. oil and gas
1803200	1810400	pipelines and refineries is simultaneously so vast they span across nearly the entire continent as
1810400	1819280	well. Effectively, this has largely made the United States an empire that is mostly capable of true
1819280	1825760	energy independence. No longer reliant on the complicated geopolitics of the outside world
1825760	1832400	for supplies necessary to power modern civilization. For economic reasons, the United States continues
1832400	1837280	to import large amounts of oil from abroad, but primarily from within the North American
1837280	1844720	continent she so thoroughly dominates. Canada and Mexico alone provide for around 60 percent
1844720	1851840	of all the imported oil used within the United States today. No longer can oil embargoes from
1851840	1857840	any coalition of nations outside of North America threaten the American supply of energy,
1857840	1863200	and nor can a naval blockade of America's energy imports that primarily come in from overland from
1863200	1868640	other parts of the continent's interior. Combined, these geographic and geologic strengths add
1868640	1874320	together to make the United States the most formidable global power of the 21st century
1874320	1880800	and human history. But it doesn't mean that the country is completely immune to external attack
1880800	1886320	and without weakness. Even though the United States is now largely energy independent in
1886320	1892320	terms of oil and gas, the country continues to maintain an extremely heavy presence across the
1892320	1898560	oil and gas-rich Middle East. Not because it directly relies on oil and gas from there for
1898560	1905600	themselves, but because the resources of the Middle East are absolutely central to the wider global
1905600	1912800	economy at large, and vital for many of the United States' most significant allies in East Asia.
1912800	1918560	Any disruption in the flow of oil and gas out of the Middle East through the Strait of Hormuz
1918560	1924160	would be incredibly destructive to the world economy, a world economy that the United States
1924160	1930640	has found itself increasingly integrated and interconnected with today. As much as 30 percent
1930640	1938720	of the entire modern U.S. GDP and nearly 40 million American jobs stem from this interconnected
1938720	1945280	web of trade with the rest of the world, which means that to a large extent, the United States
1945280	1952320	is in fact still dependent on the rest of the world, and especially the region of the world
1952320	1960560	that most powers it, the Middle East. This is why in 1991, decades before the Shale Revolution,
1960560	1967520	the United States was so swift to destroy the army of Saddam Hussein after he led Iraq into
1967520	1973520	invading and conquering neighboring Kuwait. By seizing control of Kuwait, Saddam found himself
1973520	1980400	personally in control of more than 20 percent of the entire world's supply of oil known at the time.
1980400	1985120	After mobilizing his army on the borders of Saudi Arabia immediately afterwards,
1985120	1991760	it appeared clear that he was going to invade that country as well and seize control over their
1991760	1998080	oil fields, catapulting him into possession of 45 percent of the world's known supply of oil,
1998080	2004800	which effectively would have made Saddam Hussein the master of oil's price and supply across the
2004800	2010160	planet. Unwilling to tolerate that threat to the global economy, the United States mobilized the
2010160	2017200	largest coalition of nations ever seen since the Second World War and went to war against his army,
2017200	2022960	liberating Kuwait and pushing Iraqi forces back across the border. But by doing so,
2022960	2029440	the United States committed to basing large numbers of troops in Saudi Arabia nearby to the
2029440	2035440	front line, and they didn't leave following the war's conclusion. Combined with the U.S.'s
2035440	2040880	financial support for the Saudi regime, the harsh economic sanctions imposed on Iraq following the
2040880	2047760	end of the war and the staunch American support for Israel, these events all contributed to Osama
2047760	2054800	bin Laden and his al-Qaeda organization to attack the United States directly in the deadliest single
2054800	2062880	attack ever perpetrated against the American heartland on September the 11th, 2001. In response,
2062880	2068560	the United States initiated the war on terror and subsequently invaded the landlocked
2068560	2074400	mountainous Afghanistan where the local Taliban regime was shielding bin Laden and al-Qaeda,
2074400	2080960	and so began what would ultimately transform into the longest war in American history that would
2080960	2087920	last for the next 20 grueling years, and ultimately after more than two decades of fighting that cost
2087920	2096080	more than $2 trillion and over 140,000 lives across the country, the United States ultimately
2096080	2104560	decided to withdraw almost exactly one year ago back in August of 2021, culminating in an ultimate
2104560	2111440	Taliban resurgence that swept over the country and catapulted them back into power yet again.
2111440	2117600	As with Vietnam decades before it, the war in landlocked mountainous Afghanistan ultimately
2117600	2125840	became a decisive foreign policy defeat for the United States and explicitly showcased that even
2125840	2132960	the most powerful empire in human history has its limitations. As the war in Afghanistan encompassed
2132960	2140960	more than 8% of the entirety of American history and spanned across more than two-thirds of my own
2140960	2148960	lifetime and many other Americans and Afghans alike, this conflict is perhaps the most critical
2148960	2159040	and important of all 21st century wars for us to understand in both countries how and why it began,
2159040	2164640	why it lasted for so long, and what lessons can be learned from it both within America,
2164640	2171280	Afghanistan, and the rest of the world. But unfortunately, if I made an in-depth video
2171280	2177840	about the war in Afghanistan here on YouTube, the many disturbing, violent, and controversial
2177840	2186320	details of discussing a very recent and horrible conflict would cause the video to become demonetized
2186320	2193280	and age-restricted, which I completely understand and believe is appropriate, but it ultimately
2193360	2199520	means that YouTube's algorithm would never promote the video to you, and there's just simply no way
2199520	2205360	that you would ever see it here, and that's why instead I created yet another full-length
2205360	2210800	companion video to this one in my ongoing modern conflict series that's about the exact same
2210800	2216720	length as this video that covers the entire course and explanation into America's war in
2216720	2224560	Afghanistan from the very beginning in 2001 to the very end in 2021 and uploaded it directly to
2224560	2231680	Nebula, which as I'm sure you've probably heard by now is home to tons of exclusive ad-free content
2231680	2237600	like my entire modern conflict series, with 16 other full-length videos containing more than
2237600	2243760	five and a half hours worth of additional combined content that you can go and watch right now,
2243760	2248080	covering more than a dozen recent major wars and conflicts that'll help you stay
2248080	2253920	up to date on what's going on in our world and why. From this video covering all of the events
2253920	2259600	leading up to Russia's recent decision to invade Ukraine, to this one covering the ongoing Chinese
2259600	2265680	genocide of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, this one covering the 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia,
2265680	2272480	and many more. Of course, the reason why all of these videos are only available on Nebula is because
2272480	2277920	they just wouldn't ever work here on YouTube, and would never be able to be viewed because of the
2277920	2284240	way this site works in relation to highly controversial and sensitive recent events. On the other hand,
2284240	2289920	Nebula is a totally different platform without an algorithm and without any ads. It's just a
2289920	2296400	platform about great and unique content made by great and independent educational creators,
2296400	2301520	with plenty of other unique, exclusive bonus projects from other creators you probably already
2301520	2307280	know like Real Engineering's incredible World War II era, Battle of Britain, and Logistics of
2307280	2312320	D-Day series, and multiple hour-plus long documentaries from Wendover Productions.
2312320	2318160	The best way to get access to Nebula and all of this incredible exclusive content is absolutely
2318160	2324640	through the truly amazing CuriosityStream Nebula Bundle Deal, and with its current sales price,
2324640	2331360	it's less than $15 a year to get full access to both sites. And CuriosityStream has some
2331360	2337840	pretty awesome stuff that you're definitely going to enjoy as well, like Afghanistan 1979,
2337840	2343280	an hour-long documentary covering the entire history of the Soviet Union's invasion and
2343280	2349600	occupation of Afghanistan throughout the 1980s, explaining in-depth all of the background information
2349600	2356240	that you need to know before watching my video on Nebula covering America's invasion and occupation
2356240	2362960	just over a decade after the Soviets left. I really can't recommend it enough, and I genuinely
2362960	2368640	don't know about a better deal that exists anywhere in streaming. You get two streaming sites,
2368640	2376720	both with content you'll actually watch, and all for less than $15 a year at the current sales price.
