1. **Historical Context**: The war in Afghanistan began with the US-led invasion in 2001 in response to the 9/11 attacks, which were carried out by Al-Qaeda, who had found sanctuary in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime.

3. **Complex Nature of the Conflict**: The war was marked by complex political dynamics, cultural differences, and a challenging terrain that made military success difficult to achieve and sustain.

4. **International Contributions**: Beyond the US, many NATO countries contributed troops and resources to the effort, but the international coalition faced challenges in maintaining unity and commitment over time.

5. **Taliban Resurgence**: Despite significant foreign investment in Afghan security forces, the Taliban regained momentum and eventually retook control of Afghanistan in 2021 as US and international forces withdrew.

6. **Implications for Foreign Policy**: The war in Afghanistan has been seen as a strategic defeat for the United States, highlighting the limits of military intervention and nation-building in complex conflict environments.
