1. **Feature Extraction with Convolutional Layers**: In a convolutional neural network (CNN), the first step involves applying convolution operations to extract features from the input image. These layers are responsible for identifying patterns and features within the image, such as edges or textures.

2. **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Activation**: After each convolutional layer, a ReLU activation function is applied to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex patterns.

3. **Max Pooling**: This operation reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature map by taking the maximum value over a specified window (pool size). Max pooling helps to make the detection of features robust against small variations and reduces the computational complexity of the network.

4. **Dropout**: To prevent overfitting, dropout is used. It randomly 'drops out' or zeroes out a proportion of neurons (defined by a hyperparameter like 0.25) during training, which forces the network to learn more robust features that are not reliant on any one neuron.

5. **Flattening**: Before feeding the extracted features into the dense layers, the feature maps are flattened to transform them into a format suitable for the fully connected layers that follow.

6. **Dense Layers**: These layers are fully connected and perform matrix multiplication followed by the addition of bias terms. They combine all the features learned thus far into a single vector that can be analyzed or classified.

7. **Softmax Function**: The softmax function is used in the final layer to convert the output of the neural network into probabilities, with the highest probability indicating the predicted class.

8. **Classification**: After computing the softmax output, the class with the highest probability is selected as the model's prediction.

9. **Backpropagation and Gradient Descent**: During training, the weights of the network are adjusted using backpropagation, which involves calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network. The gradients are then used to update the weights through gradient descent, iteratively improving the model's performance.

10. **Implementation and User Interaction**: The JavaScript code captures user-drawn images on a canvas element, processes mouse events to record these drawings, and submits them to a Flask web application. The Flask app handles the image input and feeds it into the trained CNN model for prediction.

11. **Deployment**: The entire application can be deployed as a web service using a platform like Heroku, allowing users to interact with the model from their browsers. Users can submit their images, and the model will output predictions in real-time.

This summary provides an overview of how a CNN works, from feature extraction to classification, and how it can be integrated into a web application for user interaction and prediction.
