0	6760	And I mean, in some sense, this is really just an effort to
6760	12320	rethink. Yeah, you've been a very busy person. And I haven't
12320	16520	been completely docile for the past period of time. So we may
16520	20400	have some useful new things. I think so. I think so. There's
20400	23480	something like there's some fundamental energy information
23480	25120	syncing up that I think we can do.
30160	33760	I also really enjoyed your stow up. You know, I listened to the
33760	40680	metacrisis and sovereignty as a the foreseen function. I vaguely
40680	43920	remember participating in that. I don't have any recollection of
43920	46480	the content. Anyway, you did a nice job articulating sovereignty,
46480	51680	metacrisis and ways in which we might cultivate sorrow, use the
51680	55680	metacrisis as a forcing function, cultivate sovereignty.
56080	61240	Indeed, or be used by it, perhaps, or be used by it. So I
61240	66840	appreciated that. And, and you did some stuff on john's
66840	71840	identity education stuff, which you had a nice conversation with
71840	76680	him on that. Yeah, and much of my attention over the past, let's
76680	81680	call it eight weeks has been towards the this broad category,
83440	88000	roughly now being known as web three. In some sense, also
88000	94640	being known as the metaverse. Okay. And being firmly Gen X, as
94640	100520	are you. I know how words and the naming of things tends to
100520	103960	happen. Yeah. Okay, remember, when there was an information
103960	109160	superhighway, and when there was a series of tubes, and there
109160	111800	was a worldwide web and various things like that, right? So I'm
111800	115400	not, I'm not sort of ensorciled by the notion that somebody like
115440	119080	Mark Zuckerberg might try to name and claim that metaverse.
119320	122800	Yep. Nor by the notion that it's very well understood exactly
122800	124840	what it is that we're referring to when we wave our hands in
124840	130040	that direction. Totally. Right. And maybe this is maybe so here's
130040	132760	the here's the point here's the conclusion. And it's not going
132760	134920	to be at all surprising to you. This is just another way of
134920	139560	saying something that we've hit on many times, is that what I
139560	143040	would say is that the notion of the content of the reference
143080	147000	metaverse. And for the moment, I'll actually just collapse web
147000	150440	three into that. Right. So I'm talking a pointer. And there's a
150440	153720	bunch of different things that are part of it. Actually, it's a
153720	159040	question. The fork in the road. So the nature of the meaning of
159040	164440	the notion of the term metaverse is as yet undetermined. It for
164440	172160	sure involves the resolution of the relationship between what in
172160	178600	many places have been called the neosphere or the virtual or
178720	182440	that thing that distinguishes humans from the rest of nature.
183640	186560	Which I call capital C culture and the culture person plane of
186600	190760	existence. The culture person plane of existence, right. It
190760	196520	involves the resolution of that question of the relationship
196520	202760	between that object and nature. So the relationship between mind
202760	207440	and body to make it very simple. Along one path, the
207440	211960	transhumanist path to kind of give it a name is the path of
212000	216520	mind establishing dominion. And I mean that quite specifically
216920	222720	over body, over nature. I personally do not like this path.
227200	231160	And then but it's not the only path. The other path is right
231160	238280	relationship between mind and body between nature. One might
238280	241560	say governed by or mediated by held by and in some sense
241560	244680	representing soul. So there's an interesting whole thing going
244680	247760	on here. From an aesthetic perspective, there's certain
247960	253040	warm tones and in this in this language feels more coherently
253040	256880	integrated more more coherently integrated. Yes, more
256880	262040	wholesome. Yes, and more thriving. And one might by the way
262040	265680	point out for those who are breast tax also more capable of
265680	268400	actually enduring for any meaningful period of time. But
268400	272400	that's like the back half of the 21st century. Right. So it's a
272440	277320	little bit longer story. But and I think that's that's that's
277320	281320	probably a conversation that's worth having more publicly and
281320	284040	more broadly, because I feel right now that we're at a moment
284040	287960	where, well, first, people are a little bit narrow and trying to
287960	290960	understand the nature of this thing metaverse. Like, is it
290960	295360	via goggles sold by Mark Zuckerberg? Categorically, no. But
295360	301280	also, I guess a little bit defeatist of a feeling of an
301280	305640	inevitability of the transhumanist path. No. And while
305640	311920	I'm certainly aware of the, how would I say the transhumanist
311920	316760	path is up by a lot of points at halftime. But it's only half
316760	320840	time. We got work to do. We have some power. A couple of
320840	325160	secret weapons to still pull out. So talk to me about secret
325160	325600	weapons.
328120	331040	Well, there's different kinds of coins and different kinds of
331040	334320	energy information patterns that we might be able to decode.
334720	338120	So as context, because I suspect with hope that we will
338120	342560	actually share this more publicly. Sure. Greg, you have
342560	345480	been having conversations with a number of other folks. For the
345480	347720	first time, my new new connections are being made
347720	353280	most notably with Anita, Anita Roy, and Forest Landry. And as
353280	357360	this a bit of context, one of the challenges that I, and by the
357400	361400	way, Eric Weinstein have bemoaned over the past decade and
361400	369920	a half is the ragtag-ness of the Rebel Alliance. The empire, as
369920	375720	empires do, has been very good at wearing shiny black leather
375760	379960	and destroying worlds with death stars. Rebel Alliance has
379960	384880	been extremely poor at unordinary, like having
384880	390960	conversation, right? So it is quite hopeful for me that these
390960	394000	conversations are now beginning to be had. People are beginning
394000	398160	to be able to learn how to orient their attention to the right
398240	401320	conversation and the right person, and then have enough
401320	406920	capacity, emotional, semantic, abstract, to be able to actually
406920	410640	have that conversation and connect. And so this is this at
410640	413480	the end of the day is our ultimate secret weapon.
414200	420400	Amen. Amen. So if right, if we can find exactly that context
420440	424480	and shared understanding to afford a participatory network
424520	429320	that enables us to weave a tapestry together, and do so then
429320	432520	to build, take the red pills together and be aware of what
432520	438520	we're doing with organization and clarity, then that's gonna
438520	441120	afford us a second half opportunity to win this game.
441440	444920	Right. That's right. Yeah. And then I would call it
446880	449200	Kool-Aid drinking metaphors notwithstanding.
452600	456200	So yes, I've been having a number of conversations with a lot
456200	458760	of different people lately. I had a conversation with, in
458760	462280	addition, Paul van der Klee just put up on, you know, and so
462280	466360	that was really interesting. And got a chance. I mean, it was a
466360	469640	private conversation with Benita. But I've been meaning to
469640	472600	hook up with her for a while. She did a wonderful presentation
472640	476920	at the stowa on the self, the origins of self, in a particular
476920	481840	way that I thought complemented the stuff that John and Christopher
481880	486360	and I had done in the elusive eye. And I could see a lot of
486400	490640	opportunities for us to, you know, synergistically dance. And
490640	494360	we were able to come together. And I knew that, you know, a lot
494360	497840	of people see my system and rightfully so as some meta
497840	501920	systemic architecture, which is always for many people are more
501920	505720	process oriented and rightfully skeptical of some obsessive
505720	509960	compulsive, you know, quasi autistic, like structure that I
509960	512600	figured out solve everything now is everybody just speaks this
512600	518160	language, we're good, you know, and there's some sub dynamic
518160	521320	there. But actually, that's not really there is that we can
521320	524000	process that aspect, but that is not all that this is. And it
524000	527960	certainly not all that this affords. So I was able to, I
527960	530960	think we were able to build some bridges and watch a process
530960	535760	dynamic approach, resonate and sync up and show also there's a
535760	539080	lot of architecture about the self and it's various facets in
539080	543880	the models to use the model is that really are very limited,
543920	547040	like genuine disagreement, just different language, different
547040	551920	emphasis. And so that's, to me, that's, Oh, yeah, no, here's
551960	556480	another example of an integrated pluralism that could be framed
556480	560760	as a Oh, no, we can't, but no can get framed as a Oh, wow. No,
560760	564240	these are these are complimentary structures that we can get a
564240	567480	coherent integrated pluralism, where people are realizing that
567480	570080	they're playing a part of the weave, you know, a thread in the
570080	574200	weave. And I had a pretty similar conversation with forest
574200	578280	on the slides, you know, that's, so there's, this is one of
578280	582200	those, how would you call it? The thing is an example of the
582200	587760	thing that it talks about? Yep. And so it should be the case. If
587760	591800	you have one of these, these objects, these, let's just call
591800	594920	them, I don't know, meta theories, just kind of get it
595040	599040	sure, very roughly articulated. This particular kind, right, as
599040	602240	you say, there's a distinction, there's a totalizing kind that
602240	608240	takes itself as a once in forever reification that has
608240	612240	no evolution of all the ability built into it. The ring to
612240	616880	way not. Yeah, exactly. The one name. One. And then this is
616880	619320	other kind, right, the kind, for example, that you're
619360	622960	representing. And the whole point is Benita is and forest is
622960	627680	and right. Right. And what should happen is, from the middle,
627800	631360	like from the middle, when these encounter each other, there
631360	635360	should be a way from their own way of being from their own
635360	640520	nature of noticing the fact that the other is the same kind of
640520	644440	thing, by definition, coming from a different place, and
644440	647520	therefore having a different way of doing what it does. But
648240	652280	intrinsic to each one of these kinds of operators is a capacity
652280	657040	to develop a bespoke protocol for communication and
657040	661720	harmonization, which then generates an instance of
662720	666840	integration and connection that again is never totalizing. It
666840	670560	doesn't collapse anything, it just creates more like a richer,
670560	672080	deeper weave and tapestry.
673400	677080	Exactly. And that, my friend, is a wonderful description of what
677080	681280	we, if we can achieve this thing and make those kinds of
681280	685960	connections, that's going to be central to it, you know, and
685960	689680	this integrated pluralism, this new kind of sensibility, which
690000	693440	I feel super intimately with John now, in terms of just a, you
693440	698000	know, so a real genuine synergy between two meta theories, you
698000	700560	know, that were completely developed independently of one
700560	705120	another, that now have lock and key, I would at least, you know,
705120	707800	so I don't want to speak for John, but for me, a lock and key
707800	711800	synergy, which I don't know has ever been done before. And, you
711800	714240	know, it'd be interesting to know in sort of the history of
714240	719480	ideas, because the old modernist structures were not systematized
719800	722080	and sort of, you know, graphically oriented in an
722080	724640	integrated pluralistic, it was, Oh, I'm going to build a
724640	727760	justification system, and then you enter into it, and then that
727760	730400	works. And then it then it's just competing between other
730400	731600	systems of justification.
731600	735400	You can sit and have, yeah, okay. I've got I've got mine. You've
735400	738440	got yours. I'm going to throw away 30%. Of mine, you're going to
738440	740760	throw away 40% of yours, we're kind of like glue them together
740760	743760	into a new one. And it's the meta move, right? I'll create a
743760	746680	meta system, which is a synthesis of two lower level
746680	750920	systems. And it's not this integrative pluralism. Maybe at
750920	752600	this point, it's actually worthwhile just spending a
752600	754440	little bit of time in the distinction between those two
754440	759640	notions. Yep, being quite decisive, if you really
759640	764440	can grasp how this, for example, categorically resolves the
764440	770360	sort of old fashioned conflict between individualism and
770360	775240	collectivism, which is just like a modernist, our artifact,
775320	779400	new context. I know that's sort of very helpful, like lots of
779400	781920	people are like, Oh, okay, cool, I can just throw out that whole
782120	785920	conflict, no longer relevant. What's happening in this new
785920	786560	context?
786920	792200	Totally. So for me, in fact, you know, the basic idea of an
792200	794600	integrative pluralism, and by the way, I heard Jim Wreck call
794600	797120	it a coherent pluralism, sometimes I'll add coherent
797120	801320	integrative pluralism together. But basically, there's an
801320	806600	appreciation of a dialectic between some sort of epicenter,
806920	811920	you know, integrating function, and a perspectival pluralistic
811920	816000	diverse shift that affords sort of this dynamic interrelation,
816000	818200	which of course, sort of just makes sense in my system, you're
818200	821320	going to have different entities coming up as specializing
821320	825640	different elements, okay, of some sort of potentially shared
825640	830680	ground. All right. And then what was before was sort of like
830720	834040	an argument that you're going to build a system of justification
834240	836920	that maps the territory, and then kind of is a pristine
836920	840040	modernist notion. Okay, if we think about this, oh, we're
840040	842760	gonna, it has to be reasoned in this based on accuracy, and
842760	845440	this based on analysis, and it's going to have truth value or
845440	848640	not, and it's going to be in competition with others, and then
848640	851640	they'll battle and maybe break up. But really, I just see them
851640	855880	basically sitting there as independent paradigms, okay, as
856040	858840	they're making truth claims. You then they get the post modern
858840	862040	structure coming along and critiquing, which basically says,
862040	865920	Oh, all of that is imminent contextual justification, meaning
865920	869040	you guys are saying you're developing your pure systems,
869040	872440	right? But really, you're it's your, you know, we think Nietzsche
872440	874280	is the first postmodern, you know, it's your it's the
874280	878320	psychology, the philosophers 90% of the goddamn system. Okay,
878600	881120	it's all just a justification of whatever dynamics they're
881120	883480	dealing with, they say it's some pristine metaphysics, but
883480	886560	it's basically their perspective in the world, right? And then we
886600	890000	can extrapolate that to the to a crass postmodern view is like
890000	893640	it's all fucking justification, it's all just a, you know, imminent
893640	896400	context of power and justification. And there's no
896400	899760	ground upon which you would then, you know, afford any
899760	903040	legitimizing function, which then of course, in its extreme,
903200	906200	says, Well, there's no, there's no claims to be made at all,
906200	909480	and all relatively equal, etc. And then of course, that's kind
909480	912920	of absurd. Right. And so the integrative plural meta modern
912920	916640	integrative pluralistic sensibility is, Hey, we all are
916640	920120	aspecializing different, you know, pieces of the elephant in a
920120	923400	particular kind of way, right? The, you know, the blind men in
923400	926200	the elephant metaphor, we're going to aspecialize, we're
926200	929240	going to see various elements. And then we were going to weave
929240	933440	together and see how these synergistically, pluralistic
933560	937160	perspectives may afford a coherent, integrated
937160	941720	understanding, and appreciate the diversity while also having a
941720	946000	shared context of richness and growth. And that, that
946000	950320	sensibility seems to me to be far superior in a synthetic
950320	953400	synthesis, hegelian sort of way from modernity, and its
953400	957160	justification, rationality, and postmodernity is at all
957160	961840	justification, context BS, to an integrated pluralism that then
961840	964920	affords a collective intelligence sense making,
964920	969800	especially if we add the zoomed eologos to it. So zoomed eologos,
969920	973280	unlike the old where you had to just write shit, right? Like
973280	974480	as I'm a someone academic,
975240	978320	like this thing right here, like this right here zoomed eologos
978320	981960	is like, so I can now call Benita. So in the old days, if we
981960	984560	were both academics, I'd publish something and then she
984560	988320	would publish a critique of my metasystemic structure, because
988320	991560	it's the wrong direction to go. Right? And then I'm like, Oh,
991600	995960	God, you know, now I have to gain a that thing, and undermine
995960	999760	that and justify why my justification system in writing
999800	1003960	in a context of competition of, you know, Swords of academia,
1004160	1006080	right? And now it's like, Oh, call somebody and be like,
1006080	1008640	actually, that's true in some ways, but that's not my full
1008640	1011080	emphasis. And I love the fact that you're going that way. And
1011080	1013880	actually, Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Because actually, I think this
1013880	1016800	is good. And this is really complimentary. Oh, so a face to
1016800	1021080	face de logos that affords the capacity to, you know, have an
1021080	1024880	oral indigenous relationship, feedback on each other, make
1024880	1028480	corrections immediately in real time, it's totally different
1028640	1033520	than the old game of refined publication, so that you get a
1033520	1036280	defense of a particular persistent in writing, where
1036280	1039760	you're basically, there's no iterative, immediate feedback
1039800	1043800	process, which is a dialogue is so unbelievably good at. So it's
1043800	1048000	a real, this de logos thing from an academic perspective, and
1048000	1051120	affording this capacity to build rich relations and an
1051120	1053800	integrative pluralistic understanding. It's a, it's a
1053840	1057240	the now we can build on some of the digital metaverse shed as a
1057240	1060720	game as a as a medium potential game changer, if we can turn it
1060720	1063040	into a strength. And I think, right, one of the things that
1063040	1067240	afford them. So as an exercise, hold on one second.
1074680	1079200	There we go. Okay, as an exercise in tough effort and
1079200	1085320	virtuality. I will act, this is the old internet ping, I will
1085320	1090480	act or I will take the what you just provided, I will metabolize
1090480	1095320	it and I will not bomb it, but articulate express back out
1095320	1099880	something. But the point, the meta point is then to say, Okay,
1099880	1105520	cool, we're doing is we're orienting in a trans to use for
1105520	1111000	specific language, transcendent location, by means of the real
1111000	1116800	relationality of this zoom de logos environment, and the sort
1116800	1121640	of pointer complex, right of the semantic terms that we happen
1121640	1126640	to be using in broadly speaking share. So couple points like
1126640	1131680	one point is the role of media. And you mentioned that in the
1131680	1136200	old days, we might even say modernity is a consequence of
1136240	1139960	books, the consequence of print, both as an opportunity and a
1139960	1144600	constraint, right, you could now communicate with a much larger
1144600	1148280	group of people over a longer period of time than just the
1148280	1151400	local individuals you could interact with in conversation.
1152400	1156240	But you couldn't have the context relevance, right, the
1156240	1161040	relational possibilities, both at the EQ level, as well as in
1161080	1163560	terms of just the semantic requirements of what what context
1163560	1168760	provides, right? So you were this new milieu of that sort of
1168760	1172200	behavior, that sort of justification system that was
1172200	1179000	selected for effectiveness in the context of book became a kind
1179000	1183440	of artifact that began to generate and attract human
1183440	1187240	attention and energy, and to coordinate more and more choices
1187240	1190520	and behaviors to the degree to which we're beginning to explore
1190520	1193360	the potentials that that afforded, which of course, we're
1193360	1196840	many, right? For example, much of the scientific enterprise is no
1196840	1200040	more or less than the fact that you can begin to collaborate with
1200040	1203240	people that you don't know by means of appropriately structured
1203240	1209160	text. And concepts like peer review, much maligned in some
1209320	1212800	quarters, which appropriately, are basically just a simple
1212800	1214600	technology to say, Okay, well, how do we deal with the
1214640	1219120	problems and the possibilities of decontextualized, relatively
1219120	1223760	broadcast, you know, tight semantic articulations. Okay,
1223760	1227400	cool. That's one, two.
1233960	1243200	The this notion of the in the larger context, many of the
1243200	1247600	things are happening. We have people are having kids, people
1247600	1252040	are making money. More specifically, there's this
1252040	1256080	wave that's been going on. And by the way, now I'm back back at
1256080	1259040	like Gutenberg, roughly speaking. So that's okay. Okay.
1262120	1264480	People were people were fighting fights, people were
1265200	1268160	conquering, that's the better word for conquering and defending
1268160	1271280	territory. It was that was already happening. That was a
1271280	1274240	whole wave. It was kind of its own sort of movement to it. And
1274240	1278080	books enters into this field. And it changes the terms of that
1278080	1283800	field, and does not sort of cause it or cause it to disappear.
1283960	1290400	But the form of the kingdom that is appropriate and possible in a
1290400	1293760	pre literate environment is not the form of a kingdom that is
1293760	1296560	possible and appropriate in a post literate environment, and
1296560	1301920	the ability to send dispatches that can communicate to further
1301960	1306200	governors, right? The British Empire was was produced as the
1306200	1308800	consequence of the ability to actually figure out how could you
1308800	1313480	effectively coordinate and deploy force and power economically,
1313520	1317640	diplomatically and kinetically, by means of the written word.
1319400	1321200	That's what it is. There's an organ for doing that kind of
1321200	1326280	thing. So we say, you know, we're in the process of a
1326280	1330000	technological disruption, at least as significant as the
1330000	1333880	book, obviously, I would say much more so. One affordance of
1333880	1337200	which is this notion of real time, highly contextual, high
1337200	1340960	relational conversation, zoom theologous. I like, by the way,
1340960	1343760	the implication of zoom is a as an adjective as well as a now.
1347040	1349560	Restrains is the state of the game. And we don't we don't
1349560	1352240	have to engage in the kinds of things that happen in the in
1352240	1356320	the decontextualized written word form, we can engage can and
1356320	1359680	should and will inevitably will engage in a different
1359760	1363720	style of interaction. Right. And it gives rise to a completely
1363720	1368040	different form of coordination, which is now well understood in
1368040	1370600	the in the thing named Web three, they don't yet I don't
1370600	1373920	think understand why, like what they're actually in service to,
1374360	1377680	or what is the real potential? What is the what are the design
1377680	1380040	characteristics of what the potential looks like on its
1380040	1382600	interior as it develops? But they're aware of the fact that
1382600	1385080	they are actually dealing with a new level of coordination and
1385080	1391080	that portends much back to Rebel Alliance and stealing a wind
1391080	1397920	here in the winning seconds. Right. Okay, hold on. Ah, and so
1398280	1405600	and much of the criticism of postmodernism is the correct is
1405600	1407560	accurate. There is a
1410440	1413960	intrinsic. It's fun. I'll just use the language from post
1413960	1417920	modern intrinsic totalizing characteristic that is associated
1417920	1424320	with the model or the approach of book, right of written of
1424320	1428560	written word, which is it's sort of because the rate of
1428560	1432040	communication, the contact, the contact decontextualization of
1432040	1439200	it. There's a need actually to form a paradigm, right. The
1439200	1441960	paradigm is an artifact of this point in time, I would say.
1442200	1448400	Hmm. Yeah, I'm gonna propose that as that's a yes. This is
1448400	1450360	actually by the way, I had this title a long time ago, but I
1450360	1455280	sort of embedded Kuhn inside Foucault. And so Foucault's
1455280	1458800	concept of the episteme is more fundamental than Kuhn's concept
1458800	1462480	of the paradigm. That the paradigm is a form appropriate to
1462480	1467720	the episteme of the moment of that. Nice. I could totally see
1467760	1472320	that. Yep. And it has to do with things like the the
1472320	1476720	translation cost of different kinds of language. If I'm
1476720	1482040	building a new same doing just like chemistry. And I've got
1482040	1484760	terms in chemistry that other people people don't know. And
1484760	1489120	it's costly to learn a new term. It's not not trivial. I'm very
1489120	1492320	confusing if you don't know what the terms mean. Right. And so
1492320	1496440	that's people trying to learn this thing. Yeah, exactly. To
1496480	1498840	the point, let's hold that actually as a good model. So the
1498840	1501520	old fashioned way of doing it is you create a dictionary. I
1501520	1503680	need to okay, well, here's the official fucking meaning of the
1503680	1506640	terms. If you need to know what they mean, go here. We've
1506640	1510720	created a formal totalizing centralized construct that has
1510720	1514840	hierarchical domination over the meanings of these words. If you
1514840	1517960	disagree, fuck you, you're out of the team, you're not on the on
1517960	1520440	the on the board. And here's what it looks like. But if we all
1520440	1524920	agree to this sort of finite construct, then we can coordinate
1524920	1529040	using these hyper decontextualized written
1529040	1531600	constructs. If you haven't got any context, you can't be like,
1531600	1533600	wait a minute, hold on. What do you mean by that? That sounds
1533600	1537040	sound weird to me. If you can't do that at all, then you
1537040	1540320	literally either you just don't communicate, or you have to have
1540320	1544040	some kind of totalizing construct that defines what is valid
1544040	1546400	discourse within a particular paradigmatic frame, right?
1548200	1550720	Just the consequence, there's no sort of here nor there. That's
1550720	1554880	just what happens. And similarly, that same thing works
1554960	1558720	to the level of political power. If I want to be able to
1558720	1564440	effectively coordinate economic, financial, kinetic, diplomatic
1564440	1567920	energy across some spatial location, I have to have a
1567920	1571000	defined after control the definitions of the meanings of
1571000	1574240	the words within that particular communications, a milieu.
1574800	1578240	Otherwise, you know, I'm saying you sell the guy on the other
1578240	1580520	side, it's like, Oh, that means buy, doesn't work, right? You
1580520	1582680	have to have agreement. What do we mean? We all have to have a
1582680	1586200	shared dictionary of what terms mean within some level of
1586200	1588360	rigor, right? And that of course, requires that each sort of
1588360	1590680	sphere of influence, which largely, of course, became
1590680	1594320	linguistic. You know, the notion of a nation is being
1594320	1598040	effectively the playing out of a particular linguistic, and
1598040	1600840	therefore, ethno cultural, but linguistic constraint. And
1600840	1604640	remember, the French formally, now have a formal institute that
1604640	1608760	is nothing but precisely defined every single word. They
1608760	1612280	kind of got the essence of it pretty precisely. That's just
1612400	1615560	how it works out. And so then, of course, as you say, we end up
1615560	1618600	kind of in this wrestling match of no, no, no, my definitions are
1618600	1621880	more right than your definitions, or our right and your
1621880	1624920	definitions are wrong. And therefore, you have to play on
1624920	1629720	my turf, because I don't want to be playing in your turf. And,
1629760	1634600	you know, the strict kind of subordinate construct, which
1634600	1639120	makes people a little bit, which gives right, like, individual
1639440	1644320	versus collectivist. And a collectivist relationship is
1644320	1650120	precisely the subordination of my experiences, my meaning, my
1650120	1654880	understanding to some kind of formal construct that is
1654880	1660240	necessary for shared communication. Hold on. So I can
1660240	1661600	make this less choppy.
1664080	1667200	The right network, the right network. Alright, well, you can do
1670120	1671600	it. Okay, so
1674840	1679240	so then we end up with the new thing, this new milieu, new
1679240	1682960	possibilities. It sits on top of the old. So one thing is that
1682960	1685040	we're part of the part of the essence of the new is that the
1685040	1687920	old happened, we're aware of it. It's not going to benefit from
1688280	1690960	okay, God, I understand all that that was part of how things
1690960	1694160	happen. I kind of learn those lessons as humans tend to the
1694160	1697600	hard way. Okay. And we're sitting in a very different
1697600	1705160	potential. If I have not only, you know, the tension, not only
1705160	1709840	can I call you and disambiguate and have relational context, but
1709840	1716080	also, I have to because the power, the possibility of some sort
1716080	1720360	of formal, man, this is a pain. What's happening? Why is that
1720360	1723240	happening? I'm seeing you like, oh, on and off, just like
1723240	1726120	completely red. Are you having the same thing on my end?
1728480	1732400	But I'm having a bit of your, yeah, you're, I mean, I'm
1732440	1735360	definitely tracking you, but it's, we got it, we have some
1735360	1736040	interference.
1736680	1740680	I don't know. On my end, everything seems very strong.
1742360	1744360	Shift to a different network.
1757800	1764000	Okay, let's see if that makes a difference. So far, nope, not at
1764000	1768640	all. It may be on your end. So let's see.
1771800	1776560	Right. So not only can I now engage in a zoom to your logos
1776560	1781320	when there's a moment of ambiguity, but also in fact,
1781440	1786560	have to because everybody's involved in the conversation.
1787400	1787960	We
1792840	1795440	I'm gonna terminate the call and start it.
1796160	1799680	Perfect. Do you want, do you want to send me a zoom link on
1799760	1801360	send you send me a zoom link? Okay.
1806600	1808960	Yeah, to the point, every, every new thing has its own
1808960	1809640	pluses in mind.
1813280	1815320	Well, there's many, right? If you take a look at how Twitter
1815320	1818840	operates. So what are the, what my, the point I was making
1818840	1821160	earlier is that we now, of course, this is the story of the
1821160	1826040	building up the internet. We have this. Oh, come on.
1828560	1829240	Are you still there?
1829560	1830640	Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.
1831840	1834360	Okay. My computer. There we go. Okay.
1836560	1840120	What do they call it back like back in the late 90s and early
1840120	1843120	2000s, like, you know, everybody has a printing press, that
1843120	1846560	kind of a thing. Free channels on TV 2000 channels to now
1846560	1850200	everybody at that point. The idea that in Twitter, everybody
1850200	1853280	is somewhat symmetric in their capacity to participate in the
1853280	1855920	conversation. They're not, no, actually, because number of
1855920	1858800	followers and algorithmic, throttling and things like
1858800	1862680	that. But it's a different environment, which means the
1862760	1866200	the tech, this is back to one of my feces, right? The notion
1866200	1868800	the, the technology, the institutional framework of the
1868800	1875320	Blue Church, which evolved to regulate the mechanics of
1875320	1880040	coordination and paradigmatic formation in the context of mass
1880040	1884280	media communication, right? Breaks down has broken down and is
1884280	1888560	accelerating in this breakdown. Because it wasn't evolved for
1888560	1892000	this particular environment, this needs to be so we're in the
1892000	1895600	process, successfully or not, of course, you can always fail to
1895600	1900920	adapt to your niche of evolving a new form of how we do this
1900920	1903760	sort of thing in this in this new potential in this new
1903760	1907920	environment. And to loop all the way back, this new environment
1907920	1911440	is one that you're calling sometimes coherent, integrative
1911760	1917560	pluralism. And it has characteristics of neither
1917560	1922840	needing or requiring a subordination on the part of
1922880	1926840	members of the dialogue. I'm not playing your game, you're not
1926840	1929880	playing my game, we are afforded the possibility and the
1929880	1933840	potential of producing a novel game bespoke, right? Every
1933840	1938360	relationship is its own play, which has as a consequence, the
1938360	1942640	enriching of both of our games intrinsically, totally, which is
1942640	1947440	why we continue to play. And I would say meta enriching, because
1947440	1953000	it's that underlying piece is so powerful, and also synergistic
1953000	1957720	value, or we call it the anti rivalrous consequence that as you
1957720	1961360	and I, for example, play in this way, and thereby enrich our own
1961480	1965400	capacities, it produces a higher degree of potential in every
1965400	1970640	other possible game we might play. Totally. So by talking with
1970640	1973520	Greg, I actually becoming more valuable player in the larger
1973520	1976560	game for literally everybody else. And if you sort of just
1976600	1980040	multiply that out, that gets from a process perspective, the
1980040	1984360	shape of that curve is very steep. It's absurdly steep,
1984360	1986800	actually. This begs the question of the singularity, we'll
1986800	1987640	ignore that for the moment.
1990240	1994560	So let's see. So, so I'll just so just to riff off that a little
1994560	1998480	bit. If I put it a little bit in Utah language, where most the
1998480	2002600	old relationship, the systems of justification that we operate
2002720	2008000	under, and our subordinate to. And now, and then so you get
2008000	2011080	modernity, you get the basically the tribe, and then the
2011080	2014360	civilization, and then it's, it's dictating into traditional
2014360	2017280	civilization. And then we get into refined knowledge, and we
2017280	2020720	get science, but modernity is still basically creating systems
2020720	2024240	of justification that you're subordinate to at various levels.
2024280	2027680	Yeah. Postmodern sort of comes along and says, Well, it's all
2027680	2030720	power, but it's still basically then like a battle of
2030720	2034200	justification in a particular way. We are actually now at a
2034200	2037720	place to, we're not going to like teleport out of justification,
2037720	2040480	but we can get adjacent to justification in a different kind
2040480	2044160	of way. Again, we can relate to these systems of justification
2044320	2048240	through, Oh, here you are as specializing in a particular
2048560	2052040	part of the whole, you know, through your narrative and
2052280	2056160	propositional structure, and I can relate to you where you are in
2056160	2059560	that, and then I share where I am in that. And now rather than
2059560	2062360	trying to then think about, Okay, there are no point of
2062360	2065200	justification, or we're going to subordinate ourselves, we're
2065200	2068160	going to be like, Oh, we're an integrated pluralistic system
2068160	2072360	of justification that we can be adjacent to participate in, but
2072360	2074800	not necessarily force some sort of
2075280	2080000	Yeah. And there's a sort of your definition of ego, what the ego
2080000	2083480	is, right? We have a bit of a historical ambiguity, you know,
2083480	2085800	Freud uses it differently than the Buddhists do. So we're going
2085800	2088680	to use the, the Greg and Rick has version of it, which I quite
2088680	2093280	like, which is the kind of the human neurocognitive faculty for
2093280	2100080	producing systems of justification. Exactly. Great. And the sort
2100080	2104440	of the classic problem is the one where you yourself subordinate
2104440	2109520	yourself to your own ego, right? The ego self inversion. Yep.
2110280	2113280	And the social version of that is the same kind of thing, right?
2113280	2116560	So if Jordan's ego is interacting with Greg's ego, and
2116560	2119320	Jordan's ego is subordinating Jordan's self and Greg's ego
2119320	2122320	is subordinating Greg's self, boom, we're locked into this
2122320	2126040	entire set of cascade effects that produce these sort of
2126040	2129960	dominant structures. This is by the way, a very clean way of
2129960	2132040	describing the transformation into game A, from my
2132040	2135680	perspective. Totally. Okay. So what we're noticing is that we
2135680	2138640	can notice that there's an individual version of this
2138640	2142080	form of just proper relationship. Oh, systems of
2142080	2146040	justification are a thing. Nice. But that's the whole thing.
2147040	2149320	Right there. They're a map. They're not the territory. And
2149320	2152760	there is a territory. How do I know? Well, the ego is a thing.
2152880	2156160	It's not the whole thing. There's a self. How do I know? Because
2156160	2159840	I do. You know, I can just, here I am, there's a self I can
2159840	2163080	begin to get very, very clean distinction of distinctions
2163080	2166040	between them by a variety of practices. In my case, it happened
2166040	2171440	to be meditation. And, and, okay, well, that affords us a
2171440	2174280	whole new possibility. We no longer have to imagine that this
2174320	2179080	game is just a kind of a winner takes all slugfest of power,
2179360	2184680	manipulation, and justification. But actually, there's, there's a
2184680	2188720	ground, there's a self, systems of justification or a tool for
2188720	2192560	coordination between things that are outside of the scope of
2192560	2196120	the systems of justification, like say, that's true, and humans.
2197480	2200720	Really? This back, by the way, to the fork transhumanism in this
2200720	2204120	other thing. Yes, right. And I would then say, what modernity
2204160	2207120	did, and then capital labor relations created a system of
2207120	2209600	justification, skits into the conversation outside of the
2209600	2212400	forest, systems of justification that then are
2212400	2216040	instrumental result in a power law distribution of influence in
2216040	2220840	a particular kind of way. And that fundamentally miscalibrates
2220840	2224080	the actual heart, which actually should be ideally
2224080	2228040	calibrated on relational value rather than social influence.
2228280	2233600	And one of our tasks in this transformation is to recalibrate
2233600	2237520	a power law distribution of influence into a more Gaussian
2237520	2240920	distribution of relational value, and connection in that
2240920	2244000	regard. So in terms of the kinds of moves that we want to be
2244000	2247440	making, relative to modernity, we want to get adjacent to our
2247440	2249920	justification, see the monsters that we created and all the
2249920	2253720	power that they did, diagnose them in a particular way, and
2253720	2256960	then rotate, you know, that if we're able to weave this
2256960	2259560	together, this will afford us the capacity to win this game.
2259760	2263160	Yep. Okay, so I want to double click on that. It's a
2263160	2267120	profoundly powerful construct in insight. Again, one of these
2267120	2270200	things that enables us to be liberated from things that in
2270200	2277000	many ways can be depressing constraints. So what you just
2277000	2283560	said is something like this. Pareto distributions are yes,
2283560	2289160	they happen. But they're an artifact of a particular form of
2289160	2293560	social relationship. So if you have a social relationship that
2293560	2295480	operates in a certain way, which I just call it, call it
2295640	2301800	society, society, we can sort of describe that in more detail,
2301800	2305720	if you have a society, then you're going to have Pareto
2305720	2312720	distributions of social relationships, kind of done. But
2312960	2314720	that's not the only kind of relationality. In fact, it's
2314720	2317680	even not even the more fundamental, but the more basic,
2317720	2320520	more fundamental kind of relationality, which I just
2320520	2325600	call community, just to make a distinction, doesn't have a
2325600	2329560	Pareto distribution as its equilibrium, right, as a Gaussian
2329560	2335000	distribution as its equilibrium. If you can land on that, like
2335000	2337680	if you're a person who spends time in places like economics or
2337680	2341680	in politics, you care about justice, this fact, this
2341680	2346720	distinction is super profound. It describes the fact that
2346720	2352840	there is there's a way to achieve a kind of quality of
2352840	2359880	relationship that we would define as, say, justice or fairness
2359960	2366160	or equity. There's an actual way to get there, right? You
2366160	2370320	can't get there staying inside the form of society. If you
2370320	2373040	stay inside the form of society, you're never going to get
2373040	2376760	there. It's not a thing. You have to go down and over into this
2376760	2379640	other form. But once you get to this other form, not only is it
2379640	2383000	possible, it's actually equilibrium state. And that's
2383000	2386160	there. That's the power of this approach of being able to say,
2386160	2390680	okay, I agree. We don't like this particular structure, this way
2390680	2396760	this structure plays out. But how is this like, what is it? Say
2396760	2400400	hello to the new boss, same as the old boss. If you think that
2400400	2402400	just by killing the king and installing yourself as king,
2402440	2404600	you're changing the nature, you're not. But there is a
2404600	2407360	different place. And it's not imaginary, right? It's not the
2407360	2413040	kind of the communist mid century, you know, failure of oh, not
2413040	2415480	getting the thing and there's a place. So let's just talk about
2415480	2419440	like, why is there a Pareto distribution in this thing I'm
2419440	2422320	calling society? What do I when I say society, what is it? I'm
2422320	2423400	really talking about what do I mean?
2424160	2424480	Yeah.
2425520	2430360	First off, the lovely yeah, I mean, the short answer. One short
2430360	2434840	answer is money and influence beget money and influence. Okay.
2435600	2439160	So as you have more opportunity to gain control, and there are
2439160	2442480	lots of different that this Pareto distribution basically is
2442480	2446240	that a small number of individuals acquire an enormous
2446240	2449480	disproportionality of influence and control, okay, and a power
2449480	2452200	kind of law distribution. So for folks that don't know what
2452200	2454440	that is, that's that's the essence of it. And then it
2454440	2457640	creates a massive inequality. And we have seen that in our
2457640	2461760	society. And virtually any context in any societal
2461760	2465080	organization tends to drift into these Pareto distributions,
2465200	2467600	they're very difficult to prevent there's a and there are
2467600	2470480	reasons why that we don't we can dialogue about but I don't know
2470480	2475040	that that's crucial. For me, the issue is that when you get this
2475040	2478720	that's going to create all sorts of problems. Okay, the focus is
2478720	2482440	on influence of our modernity, we create capital labor, what
2482440	2485200	we're basically trying to do is actually observable work
2485200	2488800	effort, and our science orient us in this perspective, which I
2488800	2491160	think is a deep mistake. One of the things that are enlightenment
2491160	2495040	is that we don't get human nature right here. And we can talk
2495040	2497720	about what the distinction is my own history of social influence,
2497720	2501200	relational value, etc. But it's the felt sense of being known in
2501200	2504200	value, it is our core, that's crucial, we certainly track
2504200	2507280	social influence. But that's another aspect. And we miss this
2507280	2510040	psychology misses this, the humanists sort of get it. But
2510040	2514080	anyway, the point what you made, we can actually see in the
2514080	2516960	world, I want to be people, all you need to do is you go back to
2516960	2521040	hunter gather oral indigenous structures, the vast majority of
2521040	2524120	oral indigenous structures are about building community. Okay,
2524360	2528840	and guess what, narcissistic ego shit is regulated deeply in
2528840	2532600	that structure, they do not want people pulling out what's
2532600	2535480	called the blue line on the in on the influence makes I'm
2535480	2538240	superior, and I'm going to egoically control your ass
2538240	2541800	through power. They regulate that virtually every community
2541840	2546160	society figures out structures to regulate it. Okay, so then what
2546160	2551480	happens is we basically release that thing in game a world, we
2551480	2555320	release that thing. The society and the Pareto distribution and
2555320	2558000	nature, power and influence afford a capacity, even our
2558000	2561680	justifications release that thing. So what we're saying is
2561680	2564720	that they Oh, my God, if we then invest in that societal
2564720	2566480	structure, in particular, well, that's what you get, you get
2566480	2570000	game. And you can't just kill that you actually need to what is
2570000	2572680	the kind of structure that's actually sustainable. Actually,
2572680	2574880	if we look at this, and we actually create a particular
2574880	2579080	type of oral indigenous DLO goes kind of dynamic that is a
2579080	2583520	fundamentally different dynamic with this ego as power issue.
2583680	2586760	Well, then maybe we have something serious going on here.
2587320	2590040	Yeah, so what I would say, and I think you're going to agree
2590040	2593320	with me on this is that the we've actually produced a lot of
2593320	2597080	good language to describe the thing that I'm calling society,
2597680	2601640	or precisely specifically the thing that more fundamental and
2601640	2607080	calling game a, which has to do with the, the prioritization,
2608720	2611640	almost obligate mediation of relationality by means of ego.
2613360	2615640	That's a very clean way of articulating it. Now, what's
2615640	2618640	happening there? Well, what's happening there is the ego at
2618640	2623040	the end of the day is a finite state machine. If you if you
2623040	2625320	understand that from a computational perspective, things
2625360	2629720	lit up. Yeah, you think about money, right? Money is a finite
2629720	2634200	state machine. It's very, you know, has a large amount of
2634400	2636880	processing power. That's why it's functional. It's what what
2636880	2641560	markets do, right markets are a massively parallel information
2641560	2647080	processing machine. But it's a finite state machine. And ego
2647480	2650960	works very functionally inside money, my ego connect quite
2650960	2653960	nicely. There's a reason why they're very wide narcissistic
2653960	2658280	ego ego personalities perform very well. And they tend to rise
2658280	2660920	to the top of the predator distribution, the 80 20 rule is
2660920	2667040	a common vernacular for that. When when one mediates complexity,
2667120	2672200	when one mediates rich, highly contextualized relationships by
2672200	2675560	means of the complicated by means of finite state machines,
2675600	2679280	even very large ones, one is operating in the form that I am
2679280	2682760	calling society, and therefore has by implication, for sure,
2682760	2686640	guaranteed things like predator distributions. Yep. And for
2686640	2691560	sure, guaranteed things like a infinite cascade effect in
2691560	2695400	paradigmatic interrelational communication. Because you now
2695400	2698240	have to find some way of doing some translation between your
2698240	2701760	finite state machine and my finite state machine, which means
2701760	2704800	that if I have a small deviation in the way that my state
2704800	2707920	machine maps particular context from yours, we actually can't
2707920	2711960	engage in any real communication, either I have to learn yours,
2712000	2715640	which is what education has become education machine for
2715640	2721520	stamping shared models on mines, which has an ancillary benefit,
2722240	2727000	training cells to become egos, socialize them into the system.
2727920	2731200	And of course, training egos to become narcissists, right? Of
2731200	2733960	course, right. So it's not if you understand how these system
2733960	2736400	dynamics work, it's not confusing how we got where we are. And
2736400	2739400	frankly, where we are, where we are is like, Oh, yeah, I know
2739440	2744080	where we are. And I know how we got here. And how we get out of
2744080	2747520	it becomes, Oh, okay, to get out of it, as you say, we need to
2747520	2751560	say human nature isn't the kind of thing that was written about
2751560	2755520	in the Enlightenment, neither Rousseau nor Voltaire nor any
2755520	2759360	of those guys were frankly close. We've got some pretty good
2759360	2761680	ideas. More importantly, we've got good models. As you say, the
2761680	2763960	oral indigenous cultures tell us what it looks like. And there
2763960	2766520	it is, those are humans operating according to human nature,
2766520	2769840	more or less. We can do a diff across a very large number and
2769840	2775000	get a nice, you know, basic model. And now double clicking on my
2775160	2780560	fork in the metaverse. And we're entering into a new milieu. We
2780560	2784320	are in fact, both literate. We're not an oral culture, we're
2784320	2788640	literate culture, decreasingly, and maybe that's the best. But
2788640	2793200	we're also a zoom, theologous, zoom, theologous culture, almost
2793200	2797880	certainly. I don't think that there's a path where we drop
2797880	2803920	back down into a pre electrical civilization. Well, I mean,
2804920	2805680	I don't like that.
2807360	2809840	And land, there's a lot of paths where we do that, but we don't
2809840	2816960	like it. Just keep going. Way, way past oral indigenous. But
2817120	2823560	there is a path where we find this new higher tone of human
2823560	2827760	nature, establishing right relationship with this thing, the
2827760	2831720	virtual, the virtual per se. And this is the key. This is the
2831720	2833880	point of the metaverse, the metaverse is where we actually
2833880	2838560	look at the notion of technology in the eye directly.
2838840	2842440	Exactly. We're not we're not looking at like a pair of eyeglasses.
2842720	2846560	Right. We're not looking at a pen. Right. We're not even looking
2846640	2849880	at a cell phone. Right. We're actually looking at the essence
2849880	2857080	of technology directly. And asking, what's the relationship
2857080	2861800	here? Because if you want to play the narcissist ego finite
2861800	2867080	state machine game, AI wins. Yeah, better playing that than any
2867080	2870360	human mind will ever be. And you know, Elon Musk's, Elon
2870360	2873280	Musk's gambit is, well, let's just become AI, like the only
2873840	2876880	thing in time for us to just do that. Which if if you don't have
2876880	2879160	the rest of this theory, it's going to make sense. That's,
2879160	2883000	that's what you'll get to. Our proposition is that no, there's
2883000	2887360	actually a whole other kind of game that we can play. I want
2887360	2891120	that it's not a relationship where we are operating and
2891120	2894800	coordinating by means of ego, by means of systems of
2894800	2898480	justification, where where systems of justification being a
2898480	2903040	thing, where we're ego being a thing, but we're actually held
2903040	2907680	in a much larger, richer, fully contextualized world called
2907680	2912640	reality. And in reality, we can actually reposition
2912640	2914520	technology in its proper location.
2915440	2916520	Beautiful said.
2918360	2919240	Easiest said to done.
2921920	2924480	By winning win the game as a function of it, but it was
2924480	2925640	brilliantly articulated.
2925680	2927880	Right, right. This is the halftime, right? This coach
2927880	2930280	would have to say, all right, all right, this is the
2930280	2931160	halftime for me.
2933720	2936200	Now there's there's a play that another game actually played
2936200	2938880	out, but that's like that. That's how it was up, right? You
2938880	2944200	got a team algorithm, right? Team, what do I call it one time
2944200	2946760	called team godless communists, just to kind of use a nice
2947160	2950200	entry Americana, which is just algorithm, just another way of
2950200	2953640	saying the same thing, right? Team ego, team narcissists, team
2953640	2957200	finite state machine, team society, team systems of
2957200	2960160	domination, team can't get outside of your own system of
2960160	2963200	justification and bullshit yourself into meaningless, right?
2963240	2966960	It's all that team, right? We're on that side. Yep. And then
2966960	2974760	team, human team, soul, team, self, team, context, team
2974760	2979000	complexity, team, nature and technology in wholesome
2979000	2982480	relationship, right? They're there in line. Totally. That's
2982480	2985280	the fork. That's the fork of the metaverse, as I'm calling it.
2985400	2987560	That's right. Calling it right now. That's the fork in the
2987560	2988160	metaverse.
2988560	2996240	And bing, bing, bing, as we said, the potency, the expansion
2996240	3000800	of the field of possibility that emerges in this new kind of
3000800	3005960	zoomed eologos, new form of generative, integrative
3005960	3008800	pluralism is our secret weapon.
3010680	3015560	And it's, yep, qualitatively vaster. It's a different order of
3015800	3021880	infinity and is possible in principle in the algorithmic
3021880	3022240	domain.
3025520	3031280	Actually, yeah, so let me, let me, let me take a slight right
3031280	3034920	turn and come back to this. Okay, because you said secret
3034920	3039120	weapon, and I totally agree, but I want to add something, some
3039120	3044440	things to that weapon. Okay. Which I, which part of through the
3044440	3048120	integrative pluralism that I really feel is emerging is a
3048200	3051040	the ground, the intellectual groundwork for a new enlightenment,
3051440	3055440	which affords the intellectual architecture in addition, you
3055440	3060120	know, to the sensibility and the media and the axioms and what
3060120	3066040	not, in addition. So, so if, if we can also analytically
3066040	3070720	diagnose the justificatory histories, okay, and demonstrate
3070720	3073680	where the human nature shit got wrong, and what science did,
3073680	3076600	and what that was wrong, and then upgrade it and say, Oh, well,
3076600	3079080	now we know that was wrong. And now this is what right is in a
3079080	3083640	way that, you know, a 15 year old can totally then narrate and
3083640	3087360	understand with reliability and validity and clarity. Yeah. Okay.
3087440	3090440	Then you're in a different kind of place in terms of what
3090600	3095480	affords the capacity to spread the system, because if we can get
3095480	3099360	it right, that the diagnosis and the upgrade analytically is
3099400	3103960	clear as well as the cultural flavor. And then that affords not
3103960	3107000	that we subordinate to it, but clear justification about what
3107000	3110760	this path is relative to our past. And in a little way, that
3110760	3114880	will afford additional momentum and capacity in getting our
3114880	3118560	shit together. Yes, particularly among those for whom
3118560	3123680	analytic. Exactly. Assessment is a key component, which is
3123680	3125920	definitely not everybody, but but in relationship to a
3125920	3128720	coordinating function, it could play a central coordinating
3128720	3133640	function in relationship. Great. Yeah, I agree. The challenge,
3133640	3137480	of course, and this is where why people like you and john play
3137640	3143480	important role is ego defense, narcissism, various forms of
3143560	3150920	fragile ego, and the unwillingness to, well, it's funny,
3150920	3153920	not just let's just be very precise, the degree to which the
3153920	3158360	ego has effectively colonized the self and protect its
3158400	3161080	territory, using the technique you guys very good at using.
3164680	3169160	So you know, if you happen to be an individual who is kind of
3169160	3173840	afforded to analytical methodologies for perceiving and
3173840	3177960	making sense of the world and then making choices, notice that
3177960	3185600	this thing we're describing ego, you may have pwned you at some
3185640	3189560	point in time. You may be particularly challenged in
3189600	3193800	unponing yourself because your your your primary faculty, so
3193800	3197800	this you this capacity to engage in this particular mode of
3197800	3203400	thinking happens to be one that is particularly gameable by the
3203400	3207680	ego. So you're sort of relying on something which itself
3207680	3210480	doesn't have your best interests in mind, and lives inside you
3210480	3213560	and uses your own, perhaps in some cases, tremendous
3213560	3219400	capacity to justify to justify itself, which is what it does
3219400	3223000	first and foremost, in all circumstances, the one thing it
3223000	3225600	justifies more than anything else is that it's your best buddy
3225600	3230160	and really needs to be in charge. And of course, complete all
3230160	3233480	the various games of you know, fear and shame and depression
3233480	3236240	on the other elements, right, it has fingers very firmly on
3236240	3238640	buttons that it's surrounded with systems of justification in
3238640	3241760	your interior. So for that portion, and here in many cases,
3241760	3244720	I'm often speaking to technologists creating web
3244720	3248840	three. Mm hmm. You got some work. You're gonna have to
3248840	3251960	actually step through this particular portal. I can tell
3251960	3256480	you, I'm of that type. And I saw this thought it through very
3256480	3260240	clearly. And then bootstrap myself through the portal, to
3260240	3262520	some extent, not particularly effectively, but better than
3262520	3266160	zero. So it can be done. And I would say also should and must
3266160	3272360	be done for path two, to be lift off, right? That's right
3272360	3276000	there. What's the other piece of it?
3280640	3287080	The analytic possibility. The other possibility, of course,
3287080	3291600	just speaks to john's video series, the meaning crisis.
3291840	3296360	Alright, this left hand side is just another way of saying the
3296360	3301440	meaning crisis. So the algorithmic transhumanist thing is
3301440	3303840	just cotton candy, man, you're not getting nutrition, you're
3303840	3308240	the whole soul, bad calories. And if the meaning and mental
3308240	3311080	health crisis and you look out across our adolescents these
3311080	3314080	days, and that doesn't think that maybe those are not the
3314080	3316520	healthiest developmental calories we should be chewing, you
3316520	3319960	know, if that doesn't make your skin get a little bit iffy,
3320160	3326680	right? Yeah, the data are pretty clear, people. Yeah, calories.
3326720	3330240	So calories. So the other side, right, there is a better way,
3330400	3332880	right? There's a better way. There's a there's a thing where
3332880	3338880	your soul is nurtured. There's this thing where you yourself is
3338880	3342960	seen and met. That's right. There's a place to get your soul
3342960	3348640	and spirit in right relation to the real natural relational
3348680	3350800	technological world we are in.
3351160	3355400	Yep. So that's the other, you know, there are other people for
3355400	3359400	whom that those words are the ones. And of course, they're
3359400	3364640	all part of the same whole. So all the different people and all
3364640	3367960	the different words so they can all be heard. And again, the
3367960	3370960	beauty of course, here's then we get this this this integrative
3371000	3375520	pluralism. Different people can have from their perspective and
3375520	3378400	their their aesthetics and there's the things that they have
3378400	3382040	seen in the beautiful aspects of reality that they've discovered
3382040	3384280	and found that are most precious and bring them forward and
3384280	3389400	share them for the nurturing and growth and development of each
3389400	3396000	other, which throws off this gigantic explosion of potential.
3397120	3400800	Lurking just on the other side of the of the what is it called
3401400	3404240	the eye of the needle, just on the other side of the needle. If
3404240	3407800	you just go through it, trick your business, you can have to
3407800	3412160	leave money behind. I don't mean like your personal money, I
3412160	3413560	mean, money as a concept.
3414520	3417600	Yeah, money's context, that little toxic.
3418400	3422040	At least as the primary as the primary mechanism for mediating
3422080	3425640	coordination. I don't know if he has no role in the future.
3425840	3429560	No, right, right, right. But as a central as the central bottom
3429560	3434720	line. Yeah, exactly. As the bottom line. No. And not even
3434720	3437480	necessarily part of one of a triple bottom line, but as a as a
3437480	3441320	piece of a much larger tapestry that we really use in the whole
3441320	3443560	complex whole as reality.
3447280	3451120	So you enforce sync up on that, which is really good, like such
3451120	3455480	a nice thing to have that as a proof, like it's provable. You
3455480	3456400	do proof on this.
3456440	3460240	No, it's a it's a I mean, we're I consider us we synced up to
3460240	3464800	start a real journey of real deep analytic deconstruction and
3464800	3468200	reconstruction relation. So I'm really looking forward. Yeah,
3468200	3471200	it's gonna be good. There's one other thing I don't know how
3471840	3475760	so what do you have? I'm on borrowed time right now, but
3476000	3477920	everybody's out and about. Let's keep going.
3478680	3481400	Alright, so here's it here. I want to drop this and see how
3481400	3484120	this because this came, I wanted to share this with you. They
3484160	3486520	listened to your last conversation on energy information
3486560	3492360	and Matthew and with Matthew. Yeah. And I wish I had more
3492360	3495640	background on him. So some of his proof of work concepts were
3495640	3501200	not did. I mean, I had to infer quite a bit in relationship
3501200	3505840	to sense making for the conversation. Yeah. But I
3505840	3508080	definitely look forward to syncing him up with him. And I
3508080	3510960	wanted to then share with you some of the stuff that I've been
3510960	3517160	doing somewhat with John on my own some coin stuff. Okay. So
3517160	3524560	with the I quite calling and connecting as I heard him talk
3524560	3528360	about the ribosome and those kinds of issues and the way in
3528360	3531400	which you're sort of the fundamental basement on energy
3531400	3537120	necessary for information and then what information is. So I'm
3537120	3542760	working on out the idea. I was working with john and we and I
3542760	3547600	was sort of like, I hooked on to this imaginal. Okay, concept
3547600	3551800	the imagine. Alright, concept of the imaginal john emphasizes
3551800	3554920	this is a differentiation between imaginary so fully
3554920	3557960	imaginary stuff that's not imaginal then is in this
3558080	3562520	intermediate space. Okay, whereby you're representing
3562520	3564560	something but then in representing it you afford
3564560	3568560	potential in utilizing it for seeing things you hadn't seen
3568560	3573920	before. Okay. And that all of a sudden that hit me in a
3573920	3578880	particular kind of way. All right. All right. whereby I
3578880	3582200	realized the concept of imaginal creates a beautiful
3582280	3586480	intermediate space between what we might call the experience of
3586480	3591200	the real so my say my perception of this can this is a can of
3591200	3593840	Dr. Pepper. Okay, and we can say, well, that's real at
3593840	3597200	whatever level of construction. I have a visual image of that.
3597320	3602080	But I see something that's real called Dr. Pepper. Okay. And
3602080	3604600	then I can have it in my head. I can have an image of that.
3604600	3608200	Yes, it corresponds to the real. Then I can imagine the Dr.
3608200	3612560	Pepper moving around. Okay. And wonder what it's like to drink
3612560	3615480	and the silver potentially an imaginal space. And then I can
3615480	3618800	have it sprout wings like a fairy and fly off and call that
3618800	3623520	imaginary. Okay. Okay. So what does that do that creates a
3623520	3626680	kind of a continuum of my immediate experience of the
3626680	3630800	real and my virtual, you know, experiential system, like as I'm
3630800	3633040	experiencing what's in what the hell is going on inside my head,
3633040	3636720	but my subjective conscious experience of being of the real
3636800	3641600	will call that the imaginal real. Okay, so so imaginal direct
3641600	3646640	representation, then imaginal would be possible. Okay, space
3646640	3650040	and then a full imaginary would then be in the space of the
3650200	3655960	counterfactual impossible. All right. So now this issue of
3655960	3661000	imaginal became a dimension around a intimate way of
3661000	3664600	information processing, specifying a dimension of its
3664600	3668680	relationship to so you have the information processor, and it's
3668680	3672040	relating to the environment in a particular kind of real way on
3672040	3678360	a continuum of the imaginary. Okay, whereby the tightest aspects
3678360	3682520	are where this imaginal real is really in good complex looping
3682560	3686200	with whatever out here versus okay, then imaginal and then
3686320	3691040	imaginary. Yeah. All right. And you notice that I'm doing this
3691040	3693960	dimension thing here, I'm creating an a y dimension up
3693960	3698160	here. Okay, that's then tracking the thing that it's
3698160	3701560	tracking. So this is the can out in the world. And then this is
3701560	3703960	my experience of it immediately. And then as it go up,
3704520	3708840	okay, and the imaginary. All right. All right. So here's the
3708840	3715120	reason that I'm doing this. Okay. This is that I believe that
3715120	3718640	there is a deep relationship between what I just specified at
3718640	3722800	the level of the imaginal and the real and the relationship
3722800	3726720	between real numbers and imaginary numbers. Oh crap. Okay.
3727400	3730840	Okay, in the way in which mathematics thinks about
3730840	3734200	imaginary numbers as being orthogonal to the real numbers.
3734760	3739240	Okay. And the way in which then when you do an imaginary and
3739240	3745040	real, you get a complex number plane. Okay. All right. The
3745040	3749320	trend. So here's what's the here's now a working map. There's
3749320	3753640	an imaginal layer of information processing in a subject. Okay,
3753680	3758400	that corresponds then that's embedded in the real world. All
3758440	3761080	right. There's a dimension upon which there's a mapping of
3761080	3767320	that of that whereby you engage in in an interactive system that
3767320	3771600	you can then talk the complex, transjective interactive, which
3771600	3774920	is basically as my imaginal system is connecting with the
3774920	3779120	real, then there will be a complex interface. Okay. All
3779120	3783800	right. I'm believing that we may have been a way to take the
3783800	3787800	topology of imaginary and real numbers and complex numbers.
3788000	3793240	Okay. And basically impute that onto Oh, the shit that happens
3793240	3798400	inside my head is akin to an imaginal dimension relative to
3798400	3803440	the real. And then I interface that with in a complex
3803440	3804720	transjective plane.
3808000	3812040	Sorry, ma'am. I do not I do not I cannot follow and I don't
3812040	3817080	mean in any way to say I disagree. I literally like when you
3817080	3819320	heard me say oh shit, like when you interjected the complex
3819320	3826640	numbers with imaginary numbers. Uh huh. I don't know my my I
3826640	3829560	cannot follow down that particular route. I'll try one more
3829560	3833080	little thing and let's see then we can drop this. Okay. There's
3833080	3834720	some stuff here that I'd like to feed back to you. There's
3834720	3837840	connects back to my conversation with Matthew and it may it may
3837840	3840240	look like there may be certain that happens or maybe that we
3840240	3842400	actually have to do this tri adequately. For example. Okay.
3842680	3845440	All right. So here's the so I was trying to explain this to my
3845480	3849440	parents. So first you have sort of energy and then you have
3849440	3852640	matter. Okay, then you know, I have the life, mind and culture
3852640	3855400	that are coming off of matter. Okay. And the tree of knowledge.
3855440	3859640	Right. Okay. So life, then really what I'm representing with
3859640	3863360	life is the complex adaptive plane of information processing
3863360	3866800	and communication that give rise to this complex network. Okay.
3867440	3871360	The semantic content of life then is being thought of as an
3871360	3874280	imaginary orthogonal dimension to matter.
3877840	3881320	Okay. So can I can I say it slightly differently? Please. Can
3881320	3890360	I say that it is a transcendent? And again, kind of like the
3890360	3894720	Landry sense or in the sense of like a Kantian sense even. Sure.
3895160	3898240	Okay, we're saying more or less the same thing. Yep. Okay,
3898240	3902480	great. Yep. So to say the language back. And this is actually
3902480	3905200	kind of interrupts. Let's do it. Let's do it more like this. Yep.
3915440	3922960	We can do this very easily. I got a real cow. And I got a real
3922960	3927840	bucket. And I need to tell you, Hey, would you mind taking that
3927840	3932920	bucket over that cow and milk the cow? Now we have this really
3932920	3937160	cool thing where I can replace the actual physical real cow,
3937200	3941720	which is heavy and over there with this sound cow, which
3941720	3946000	resembles it in many ways, not at all. Totally. And yet, enables
3946000	3949680	us to coordinate our orientation so that shit can
3949680	3953880	happen. Now, on paper, you know, this is sort of classic
3954000	3956720	semiotics, I have a I'll draw a picture of a cow, which is
3956720	3960200	already representation. I've got the word cow. And they are
3960200	3965320	both pointing to something that is is real. But it is
3965320	3968120	transcendent, right? It is neither the physical embodied
3968120	3972600	actual metabolic cow or the sound cow. And yet, there's a way
3972600	3974520	for them to be pointing at the same kind of thing, which you're
3974520	3976720	now saying that's the at the imaginary that is or the
3976720	3981440	imaginal that's in the imaginal plane, the imaginal mode. Yes,
3981440	3987120	okay. And then we have two, we have three three things, right?
3987160	3990480	First is that that can happen. That's part of the universe we
3990480	3995560	live in is that can happen. The second is that there is an
3995560	4001040	energetic benefit and energetic cost associated with that move.
4002360	4007400	The cost is the information processor that has the capacity
4007400	4011720	to do whatever sorts of sort of perception, disambiguation,
4011920	4017360	pattern recognition work necessary to be able to map to
4018360	4023680	percept or tons to each other. The energetic savings is a
4023720	4027000	benefit is what you can do when you don't have to actually
4027000	4030280	physically walk over and touch the cow and wave the bucket
4030280	4034120	around, but can actually just issue the sentence. Yeah. So
4034360	4037960	there's sort of this trade off brain, right? The the innovation
4037960	4041560	of brain is the discovery of the potential available when you
4041560	4044840	have an organ of information processing potential of a brain
4044960	4047640	that can then use systems of justification linguistically to
4047640	4050040	coordinate them into a distributed cognition function,
4050320	4053640	which enables an unlocking of a tremendous amount of
4053800	4056280	information compression in the transcendent or in the
4056280	4059920	imaginal space, which is what we're doing right now. Alright,
4059960	4064840	so. Brilliant. Yeah. So, so, right. So now that what the
4064840	4067560	Tree of Knowledge saying is that you look at a life and that
4067560	4072760	life, the semantics of life at the cell level, the RNA DNA
4072760	4075920	when he's describing the ribosome, so that information
4075920	4079360	store that affords the complex dynamics of a cell to make its
4079360	4083920	decisions in relation is I life, imaginal life. It's the
4084000	4087800	it's the semantics of okay, that they can't be reduced to the
4087800	4091080	fucking matter because it's this instantiated modeling of
4091080	4095080	matter and it communicates at this network-binded level. So
4095080	4097600	then it affords us that what is the semantic binding that's
4097600	4100480	modeling the reality through this information network that
4100480	4103040	then is doing it based on energy constraints, as they was
4103040	4105440	talking about. So it's the information relative to energy
4105440	4109840	constraint. Yeah. And then that's the cell DNA, RNA
4110560	4113120	communication network structure that gives rise to what we
4113120	4116680	call the life plane of existence. Then it's mediated by this
4116680	4121600	kind of imaginal processing. And then you upgrade that. So now
4121600	4124680	you get a dimensional of imagination, imaginal around
4124680	4128400	neuro cognition through a brain and the animal mindedness of
4128400	4131520	sensory motor looping. And it's doing an imaginal in
4131520	4135480	relationship to the biological. So it then drops the imaginal up
4135480	4139480	a degree. So that's a secondary imaginal. And then us through a
4139480	4144120	proposition, we get a third tertiary imagine. Yep. Okay. And
4144120	4147880	now we can stack the imaginal languages upon each other. And
4147880	4150600	the relationship is this orthogonal informational
4150600	4153600	relation. Yes. And then sort of kind of use the metaphor you
4153600	4156480	used earlier. The thing that Matthew and I were talking
4156480	4158800	about is the distinction between the proof of work
4158800	4162520	methodology and the fake methodology is the distinction
4162520	4166520	between the imaginal and the imaginary. Exactly. Yes. Okay.
4166600	4172040	proof of stake has as it's sort of it has a dairy Doridian a
4172040	4181320	dairy da. Hold on. Just crash the internet again. Back proof
4181320	4184720	of stake. Yes. The last I heard was proof of stake proof of
4184720	4187920	stake is effectively identical isomorphic to many of the
4187920	4193720	problems we were just discussing in terms of like dairy
4193720	4196960	does point around language. If it's entirely self
4196960	4200520	referential, if a word means only its relationship to all the
4200520	4205000	other words in a language, then it's not it's not bound to
4205120	4208040	reality. It's not bound to nature. It's not bound to
4210240	4215200	anything other than its own systems of justification. Actually,
4215200	4217880	as it turns out, the only the only way you can get there is
4217880	4222000	actually already when you've lost the plot and have self
4222000	4226200	identified the ego, the systems of justification as reality. And
4226200	4228480	then you kind of look around go nothing the systems of
4228480	4231720	justification around here. And then you know that you run off
4231720	4235560	on that on that sort of in some sense preordained dead end
4235560	4238600	journey. But you're like, no, no, no, there is a way there is
4238600	4241960	as you say, Hey, if I if I'm just doing something very simple,
4242240	4245680	like say, Hey, would you bring me that hammer? And the loop has
4245680	4250000	a loop that goes from the informational into the energetic,
4250160	4253600	meaning did you actually did the Greg actually hear what I was
4253600	4256280	saying, understand it, walk over grab the object notice hammer
4256360	4259160	and bring it to me. If yes, that loop right the loop from the
4259160	4262880	informational down to the energetic backup is real. And
4262880	4265360	that's part of reality. If you're running in just the
4265360	4269600	algorithm, just the informational, it's unconnected to
4269600	4272800	reality and is sort of preordained to closure and
4272800	4276480	entropic noise in a finite time relatively quickly, by the way.
4277320	4281600	But if I'm looping it, you know, and that's just in complex
4281600	4285160	space, there's we use the word of complex dynamic space, and
4285160	4288560	that's life, right? Then I'm just engaging in adaptive life.
4289000	4294840	And so, so by the way, the hypothesis here, which is, I'm
4294840	4298240	gonna say, that's what it feels like it may be a big deal is to
4298240	4304840	say this thing, proof of work, which I learned as a, like a
4304840	4311240	pragmatic notion. Oh, it's a way of solving a particular kind of
4311240	4316280	kind of game theoretic problem, which has resolved a mathematical
4316280	4319960	question around the Byzantine general's problem. Okay, I
4319960	4325120	can almost like, but just inside that book, go, Okay, okay, I
4325120	4327520	get how it solves that problem. This is a very different
4327520	4331000	proposition. The proposition here to say no, no, no, this is the
4331000	4337200	thing that enables the joint point, evoking Greg H, the joint
4337200	4342960	point of person culture space to actually move to whatever this
4342960	4347120	next level is. That's the thing that I'm pointing out, which is
4347120	4350400	why I had to CC you on this one, right? The purpose is that this
4350400	4354800	thing, proof of work is the thing that enables computation,
4355400	4359600	which is information processing, qua information
4359600	4362600	processing, because if we're looking now at technology,
4362600	4366920	qua technology, not any artifact of technology, we're
4366920	4369720	looking at computation, qua computation, information
4369720	4372520	processing, information theory, information in and of itself.
4373040	4377040	Proof of work is nothing more or less than the mechanism by
4377040	4383840	which that is strictly bound to energy. And that if you don't
4383840	4386480	have energy bound information bound to energy, then
4386480	4391520	information flies off into a an entropic closure, which goes to
4391520	4396160	noise in a finite time. If you do have it bound, then you're
4396160	4398200	beginning to actually do something which is happening in
4398200	4400360	the real. And you can begin to build on that.
4401640	4402920	Like a complex system.
4404240	4409760	Yeah. So so I'm now a I'm now a proof of work maximalist.
4409880	4415320	Yeah. Yeah. And what that does is it affords a foundational
4415320	4418720	linkage between a foundational concept to foundational
4418720	4422920	concepts, okay, of energy and information on the one hand.
4423880	4426960	And now the ease with which you metabolize what I was saying
4426960	4433160	once I rotated a bit, okay, the the this relationship between
4433160	4435520	these dimensions of complexification, this life
4435520	4438960	mind and culture ship, okay, to go back to what I was saying,
4438960	4444120	like we can upgrade the old misunderstandings, the entire
4444120	4447160	enlightenment failed to appreciate how to fucking get
4447160	4452640	from matter in motion into actual, what do we mean by life?
4452640	4455480	What do we mean by mind? What do we mean by culture? Because
4455480	4458040	they were operating on a particular set of assumptions
4458040	4463640	of what the real had to be. Okay. And now that we can point in
4463640	4467360	mathematics to the logical relations between structures
4467360	4471400	like between real and imaginary numbers and the orthogonal
4471400	4474560	mapping between those that actually transposed in the
4474560	4478920	relationship between real and information processing. All right.
4479400	4482000	We are afforded to me what I'm wondering about is we're
4482000	4489000	affording a particular framing that has long eluded our
4489640	4493240	understanding basically between matter and mind ultimately
4493240	4495880	or between energy and a matter and a life and a mind and a
4495880	4500720	culture into the forms that we are using to map the substances
4500840	4504960	and to create a transjective conforming grip between being
4504960	4507560	and thinking into a clear metaphysics.
4509160	4515520	Yeah. Yeah, just as a nice, how does it not even caveat, but
4515520	4520320	just a nice thing to put out there. My mind does not handle
4520320	4523560	certain kinds of math particularly well. And I can tell
4523560	4526160	you right now that I have I've endeavored mightily to
4526160	4530000	understand what the fuck are meant by imaginary numbers. I can
4530000	4532240	get them down to their formulas. I can use them. I can do
4532240	4536120	stuff with it. Right. But I kind of got nothing. Like it feels
4536120	4541800	very weirdly almost panic. Whoa. But you know, barring that
4541800	4546240	leap right there. The continuity of what you were just
4546240	4549360	describing. And we could probably continue to kind of
4549480	4552120	massage it and hammer on it. I get where you're going. I get
4552120	4554960	them. I get the point. Let me see. There's some other things
4555040	4560560	that came up. So yes, I think that Oh, okay, there's a couple.
4560560	4564640	One is an acknowledgement, a thing that we should acknowledge
4564640	4569880	as a culture. You know, we're on the one hand, we're standing
4569880	4573240	on the shoulders of giants. On the other hand, we're standing
4573240	4576600	on foundations of sand. beautifully. So right, these are
4576600	4581760	both true. And the guys were doing their best with very, very
4581800	4586280	limited frameworks, ability to experiment, coordination
4586280	4591120	capacity. And there's a lot of path dependent stuff that was
4591160	4593680	outweighing the swept into the rug. Like, shit, I don't
4593680	4595240	understand how that works. Well, fuck it, I got to figure out
4595240	4598920	how to do this problem over here. Fine. Simplify, reify. Hope
4598920	4602040	it doesn't come up until after you know, my job is done, which
4602040	4603880	is a pretty human thing. What a human nature. That's a very
4603880	4606160	human thing to do. Sounds like a reasonable justification.
4606840	4611480	Exactly. And it's okay. Like it's okay for us to actually
4611520	4613760	zoom back and look at something and say, Oh, all right,
4613760	4617760	let's, let's take this unexamined for 300 years set of
4617760	4622320	axiomatics. Oh, boy, these are really, really not particularly
4622320	4625840	functional. All right, fine. So unplug that, let's expand it
4625840	4628760	back out. See, geez, look at all this structure that was built
4628760	4631760	on top of a bunch of actually quite poor axiomatics. How much
4631760	4634280	of that can we just throw away? Well, a lot of it. What can we
4634280	4637120	build new neat stuff? Can we plug a lot of old stuff into it?
4637120	4639280	Sure. Because most of the old stuff was actually just
4639280	4641440	pragmatic, having to do with what really works in a real
4641440	4645200	world, right? Or looping it all the way back, by the way, the
4645200	4649560	technocratic error. Technocratic error is built on top of a lot
4649560	4653920	of those axiomatic errors in a deep way. And it's not it's a
4653920	4658360	problem. It's something that it had the loops have not closed to
4658360	4662400	force the capitulation that it's a problem, but it's a problem.
4662480	4666000	And we can again, we can argue that ad nauseum, which Matthew
4666000	4668400	actually does a quite a good job at in language that doesn't
4668520	4671920	you know, nobody's going to understand. None of the tech
4671960	4674080	none of those who are motivated enough to understand it will
4674080	4678160	understand it's a bit of a right, right, right. But yes, that
4678160	4680120	acknowledgement of saying, Hey, we actually are in a position
4680120	4682560	where we can use these things like zoomed dialogues and
4682560	4687080	integrative pluralism to radically upgrade the robustness of
4687080	4689320	the way that we go about thinking about this whole story,
4689320	4692200	we're not beholden in an enlightened era, or modernist
4692200	4696360	era, or late 20th century, like we're not beholden too much, if
4696360	4698880	anything really mean the whole point of this integrative
4698880	4702560	pluralism frame is like, look, Greg and I met what two years
4702560	4707640	ago. If that you've got a vast, you know, long lifetime of
4707640	4710440	thinking about lots of things. Right. And from point of view,
4710440	4713800	that's not my native point of view. I've got my own stuff. And
4713800	4715960	yet, we've been able to figure out how to achieve generative
4715960	4718640	dialogue. Effectively, instantly, this is a key thing
4718640	4721760	like media. And then it continued the process. So it's
4721760	4728960	a total one grip, and then it can expand. And it's, it's like
4728960	4732520	useful from the very get go, and continues to have richness,
4732520	4735600	which is nice. Right, you don't have to have this, it sucks for
4735600	4738000	two years, and it's useless, then hope it works out and get a
4738000	4740880	payload at the end, you can actually have a nice smooth. Okay,
4740880	4743280	cool. This is an interesting insight. I walk away from this
4743280	4747040	with some increased capacity, more meaningful existence in life
4747040	4750480	and reality, and notice that it just affords more possibility on
4750480	4754440	the afford basis. Totally on my end as well. And that's the
4754440	4760720	synergy of it. And man, we tap that. Yeah. And now I am. Yeah,
4760720	4763320	the borrowed time is definitely no longer. It's been called due.
4763320	4768720	So, I hear. Good to see you, Ron. Me too. So it's a, hey, man.
4769000	4770600	Enjoyed it. Yeah, bye bye.
