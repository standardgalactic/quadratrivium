WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.760
And I mean, in some sense, this is really just an effort to

00:06.760 --> 00:12.320
rethink. Yeah, you've been a very busy person. And I haven't

00:12.320 --> 00:16.520
been completely docile for the past period of time. So we may

00:16.520 --> 00:20.400
have some useful new things. I think so. I think so. There's

00:20.400 --> 00:23.480
something like there's some fundamental energy information

00:23.480 --> 00:25.120
syncing up that I think we can do.

00:30.160 --> 00:33.760
I also really enjoyed your stow up. You know, I listened to the

00:33.760 --> 00:40.680
metacrisis and sovereignty as a the foreseen function. I vaguely

00:40.680 --> 00:43.920
remember participating in that. I don't have any recollection of

00:43.920 --> 00:46.480
the content. Anyway, you did a nice job articulating sovereignty,

00:46.480 --> 00:51.680
metacrisis and ways in which we might cultivate sorrow, use the

00:51.680 --> 00:55.680
metacrisis as a forcing function, cultivate sovereignty.

00:56.080 --> 01:01.240
Indeed, or be used by it, perhaps, or be used by it. So I

01:01.240 --> 01:06.840
appreciated that. And, and you did some stuff on john's

01:06.840 --> 01:11.840
identity education stuff, which you had a nice conversation with

01:11.840 --> 01:16.680
him on that. Yeah, and much of my attention over the past, let's

01:16.680 --> 01:21.680
call it eight weeks has been towards the this broad category,

01:23.440 --> 01:28.000
roughly now being known as web three. In some sense, also

01:28.000 --> 01:34.640
being known as the metaverse. Okay. And being firmly Gen X, as

01:34.640 --> 01:40.520
are you. I know how words and the naming of things tends to

01:40.520 --> 01:43.960
happen. Yeah. Okay, remember, when there was an information

01:43.960 --> 01:49.160
superhighway, and when there was a series of tubes, and there

01:49.160 --> 01:51.800
was a worldwide web and various things like that, right? So I'm

01:51.800 --> 01:55.400
not, I'm not sort of ensorciled by the notion that somebody like

01:55.440 --> 01:59.080
Mark Zuckerberg might try to name and claim that metaverse.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.800
Yep. Nor by the notion that it's very well understood exactly

02:02.800 --> 02:04.840
what it is that we're referring to when we wave our hands in

02:04.840 --> 02:10.040
that direction. Totally. Right. And maybe this is maybe so here's

02:10.040 --> 02:12.760
the here's the point here's the conclusion. And it's not going

02:12.760 --> 02:14.920
to be at all surprising to you. This is just another way of

02:14.920 --> 02:19.560
saying something that we've hit on many times, is that what I

02:19.560 --> 02:23.040
would say is that the notion of the content of the reference

02:23.080 --> 02:27.000
metaverse. And for the moment, I'll actually just collapse web

02:27.000 --> 02:30.440
three into that. Right. So I'm talking a pointer. And there's a

02:30.440 --> 02:33.720
bunch of different things that are part of it. Actually, it's a

02:33.720 --> 02:39.040
question. The fork in the road. So the nature of the meaning of

02:39.040 --> 02:44.440
the notion of the term metaverse is as yet undetermined. It for

02:44.440 --> 02:52.160
sure involves the resolution of the relationship between what in

02:52.160 --> 02:58.600
many places have been called the neosphere or the virtual or

02:58.720 --> 03:02.440
that thing that distinguishes humans from the rest of nature.

03:03.640 --> 03:06.560
Which I call capital C culture and the culture person plane of

03:06.600 --> 03:10.760
existence. The culture person plane of existence, right. It

03:10.760 --> 03:16.520
involves the resolution of that question of the relationship

03:16.520 --> 03:22.760
between that object and nature. So the relationship between mind

03:22.760 --> 03:27.440
and body to make it very simple. Along one path, the

03:27.440 --> 03:31.960
transhumanist path to kind of give it a name is the path of

03:32.000 --> 03:36.520
mind establishing dominion. And I mean that quite specifically

03:36.920 --> 03:42.720
over body, over nature. I personally do not like this path.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.160
And then but it's not the only path. The other path is right

03:51.160 --> 03:58.280
relationship between mind and body between nature. One might

03:58.280 --> 04:01.560
say governed by or mediated by held by and in some sense

04:01.560 --> 04:04.680
representing soul. So there's an interesting whole thing going

04:04.680 --> 04:07.760
on here. From an aesthetic perspective, there's certain

04:07.960 --> 04:13.040
warm tones and in this in this language feels more coherently

04:13.040 --> 04:16.880
integrated more more coherently integrated. Yes, more

04:16.880 --> 04:22.040
wholesome. Yes, and more thriving. And one might by the way

04:22.040 --> 04:25.680
point out for those who are breast tax also more capable of

04:25.680 --> 04:28.400
actually enduring for any meaningful period of time. But

04:28.400 --> 04:32.400
that's like the back half of the 21st century. Right. So it's a

04:32.440 --> 04:37.320
little bit longer story. But and I think that's that's that's

04:37.320 --> 04:41.320
probably a conversation that's worth having more publicly and

04:41.320 --> 04:44.040
more broadly, because I feel right now that we're at a moment

04:44.040 --> 04:47.960
where, well, first, people are a little bit narrow and trying to

04:47.960 --> 04:50.960
understand the nature of this thing metaverse. Like, is it

04:50.960 --> 04:55.360
via goggles sold by Mark Zuckerberg? Categorically, no. But

04:55.360 --> 05:01.280
also, I guess a little bit defeatist of a feeling of an

05:01.280 --> 05:05.640
inevitability of the transhumanist path. No. And while

05:05.640 --> 05:11.920
I'm certainly aware of the, how would I say the transhumanist

05:11.920 --> 05:16.760
path is up by a lot of points at halftime. But it's only half

05:16.760 --> 05:20.840
time. We got work to do. We have some power. A couple of

05:20.840 --> 05:25.160
secret weapons to still pull out. So talk to me about secret

05:25.160 --> 05:25.600
weapons.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.040
Well, there's different kinds of coins and different kinds of

05:31.040 --> 05:34.320
energy information patterns that we might be able to decode.

05:34.720 --> 05:38.120
So as context, because I suspect with hope that we will

05:38.120 --> 05:42.560
actually share this more publicly. Sure. Greg, you have

05:42.560 --> 05:45.480
been having conversations with a number of other folks. For the

05:45.480 --> 05:47.720
first time, my new new connections are being made

05:47.720 --> 05:53.280
most notably with Anita, Anita Roy, and Forest Landry. And as

05:53.280 --> 05:57.360
this a bit of context, one of the challenges that I, and by the

05:57.400 --> 06:01.400
way, Eric Weinstein have bemoaned over the past decade and

06:01.400 --> 06:09.920
a half is the ragtag-ness of the Rebel Alliance. The empire, as

06:09.920 --> 06:15.720
empires do, has been very good at wearing shiny black leather

06:15.760 --> 06:19.960
and destroying worlds with death stars. Rebel Alliance has

06:19.960 --> 06:24.880
been extremely poor at unordinary, like having

06:24.880 --> 06:30.960
conversation, right? So it is quite hopeful for me that these

06:30.960 --> 06:34.000
conversations are now beginning to be had. People are beginning

06:34.000 --> 06:38.160
to be able to learn how to orient their attention to the right

06:38.240 --> 06:41.320
conversation and the right person, and then have enough

06:41.320 --> 06:46.920
capacity, emotional, semantic, abstract, to be able to actually

06:46.920 --> 06:50.640
have that conversation and connect. And so this is this at

06:50.640 --> 06:53.480
the end of the day is our ultimate secret weapon.

06:54.200 --> 07:00.400
Amen. Amen. So if right, if we can find exactly that context

07:00.440 --> 07:04.480
and shared understanding to afford a participatory network

07:04.520 --> 07:09.320
that enables us to weave a tapestry together, and do so then

07:09.320 --> 07:12.520
to build, take the red pills together and be aware of what

07:12.520 --> 07:18.520
we're doing with organization and clarity, then that's gonna

07:18.520 --> 07:21.120
afford us a second half opportunity to win this game.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.920
Right. That's right. Yeah. And then I would call it

07:26.880 --> 07:29.200
Kool-Aid drinking metaphors notwithstanding.

07:32.600 --> 07:36.200
So yes, I've been having a number of conversations with a lot

07:36.200 --> 07:38.760
of different people lately. I had a conversation with, in

07:38.760 --> 07:42.280
addition, Paul van der Klee just put up on, you know, and so

07:42.280 --> 07:46.360
that was really interesting. And got a chance. I mean, it was a

07:46.360 --> 07:49.640
private conversation with Benita. But I've been meaning to

07:49.640 --> 07:52.600
hook up with her for a while. She did a wonderful presentation

07:52.640 --> 07:56.920
at the stowa on the self, the origins of self, in a particular

07:56.920 --> 08:01.840
way that I thought complemented the stuff that John and Christopher

08:01.880 --> 08:06.360
and I had done in the elusive eye. And I could see a lot of

08:06.400 --> 08:10.640
opportunities for us to, you know, synergistically dance. And

08:10.640 --> 08:14.360
we were able to come together. And I knew that, you know, a lot

08:14.360 --> 08:17.840
of people see my system and rightfully so as some meta

08:17.840 --> 08:21.920
systemic architecture, which is always for many people are more

08:21.920 --> 08:25.720
process oriented and rightfully skeptical of some obsessive

08:25.720 --> 08:29.960
compulsive, you know, quasi autistic, like structure that I

08:29.960 --> 08:32.600
figured out solve everything now is everybody just speaks this

08:32.600 --> 08:38.160
language, we're good, you know, and there's some sub dynamic

08:38.160 --> 08:41.320
there. But actually, that's not really there is that we can

08:41.320 --> 08:44.000
process that aspect, but that is not all that this is. And it

08:44.000 --> 08:47.960
certainly not all that this affords. So I was able to, I

08:47.960 --> 08:50.960
think we were able to build some bridges and watch a process

08:50.960 --> 08:55.760
dynamic approach, resonate and sync up and show also there's a

08:55.760 --> 08:59.080
lot of architecture about the self and it's various facets in

08:59.080 --> 09:03.880
the models to use the model is that really are very limited,

09:03.920 --> 09:07.040
like genuine disagreement, just different language, different

09:07.040 --> 09:11.920
emphasis. And so that's, to me, that's, Oh, yeah, no, here's

09:11.960 --> 09:16.480
another example of an integrated pluralism that could be framed

09:16.480 --> 09:20.760
as a Oh, no, we can't, but no can get framed as a Oh, wow. No,

09:20.760 --> 09:24.240
these are these are complimentary structures that we can get a

09:24.240 --> 09:27.480
coherent integrated pluralism, where people are realizing that

09:27.480 --> 09:30.080
they're playing a part of the weave, you know, a thread in the

09:30.080 --> 09:34.200
weave. And I had a pretty similar conversation with forest

09:34.200 --> 09:38.280
on the slides, you know, that's, so there's, this is one of

09:38.280 --> 09:42.200
those, how would you call it? The thing is an example of the

09:42.200 --> 09:47.760
thing that it talks about? Yep. And so it should be the case. If

09:47.760 --> 09:51.800
you have one of these, these objects, these, let's just call

09:51.800 --> 09:54.920
them, I don't know, meta theories, just kind of get it

09:55.040 --> 09:59.040
sure, very roughly articulated. This particular kind, right, as

09:59.040 --> 10:02.240
you say, there's a distinction, there's a totalizing kind that

10:02.240 --> 10:08.240
takes itself as a once in forever reification that has

10:08.240 --> 10:12.240
no evolution of all the ability built into it. The ring to

10:12.240 --> 10:16.880
way not. Yeah, exactly. The one name. One. And then this is

10:16.880 --> 10:19.320
other kind, right, the kind, for example, that you're

10:19.360 --> 10:22.960
representing. And the whole point is Benita is and forest is

10:22.960 --> 10:27.680
and right. Right. And what should happen is, from the middle,

10:27.800 --> 10:31.360
like from the middle, when these encounter each other, there

10:31.360 --> 10:35.360
should be a way from their own way of being from their own

10:35.360 --> 10:40.520
nature of noticing the fact that the other is the same kind of

10:40.520 --> 10:44.440
thing, by definition, coming from a different place, and

10:44.440 --> 10:47.520
therefore having a different way of doing what it does. But

10:48.240 --> 10:52.280
intrinsic to each one of these kinds of operators is a capacity

10:52.280 --> 10:57.040
to develop a bespoke protocol for communication and

10:57.040 --> 11:01.720
harmonization, which then generates an instance of

11:02.720 --> 11:06.840
integration and connection that again is never totalizing. It

11:06.840 --> 11:10.560
doesn't collapse anything, it just creates more like a richer,

11:10.560 --> 11:12.080
deeper weave and tapestry.

11:13.400 --> 11:17.080
Exactly. And that, my friend, is a wonderful description of what

11:17.080 --> 11:21.280
we, if we can achieve this thing and make those kinds of

11:21.280 --> 11:25.960
connections, that's going to be central to it, you know, and

11:25.960 --> 11:29.680
this integrated pluralism, this new kind of sensibility, which

11:30.000 --> 11:33.440
I feel super intimately with John now, in terms of just a, you

11:33.440 --> 11:38.000
know, so a real genuine synergy between two meta theories, you

11:38.000 --> 11:40.560
know, that were completely developed independently of one

11:40.560 --> 11:45.120
another, that now have lock and key, I would at least, you know,

11:45.120 --> 11:47.800
so I don't want to speak for John, but for me, a lock and key

11:47.800 --> 11:51.800
synergy, which I don't know has ever been done before. And, you

11:51.800 --> 11:54.240
know, it'd be interesting to know in sort of the history of

11:54.240 --> 11:59.480
ideas, because the old modernist structures were not systematized

11:59.800 --> 12:02.080
and sort of, you know, graphically oriented in an

12:02.080 --> 12:04.640
integrated pluralistic, it was, Oh, I'm going to build a

12:04.640 --> 12:07.760
justification system, and then you enter into it, and then that

12:07.760 --> 12:10.400
works. And then it then it's just competing between other

12:10.400 --> 12:11.600
systems of justification.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.400
You can sit and have, yeah, okay. I've got I've got mine. You've

12:15.400 --> 12:18.440
got yours. I'm going to throw away 30%. Of mine, you're going to

12:18.440 --> 12:20.760
throw away 40% of yours, we're kind of like glue them together

12:20.760 --> 12:23.760
into a new one. And it's the meta move, right? I'll create a

12:23.760 --> 12:26.680
meta system, which is a synthesis of two lower level

12:26.680 --> 12:30.920
systems. And it's not this integrative pluralism. Maybe at

12:30.920 --> 12:32.600
this point, it's actually worthwhile just spending a

12:32.600 --> 12:34.440
little bit of time in the distinction between those two

12:34.440 --> 12:39.640
notions. Yep, being quite decisive, if you really

12:39.640 --> 12:44.440
can grasp how this, for example, categorically resolves the

12:44.440 --> 12:50.360
sort of old fashioned conflict between individualism and

12:50.360 --> 12:55.240
collectivism, which is just like a modernist, our artifact,

12:55.320 --> 12:59.400
new context. I know that's sort of very helpful, like lots of

12:59.400 --> 13:01.920
people are like, Oh, okay, cool, I can just throw out that whole

13:02.120 --> 13:05.920
conflict, no longer relevant. What's happening in this new

13:05.920 --> 13:06.560
context?

13:06.920 --> 13:12.200
Totally. So for me, in fact, you know, the basic idea of an

13:12.200 --> 13:14.600
integrative pluralism, and by the way, I heard Jim Wreck call

13:14.600 --> 13:17.120
it a coherent pluralism, sometimes I'll add coherent

13:17.120 --> 13:21.320
integrative pluralism together. But basically, there's an

13:21.320 --> 13:26.600
appreciation of a dialectic between some sort of epicenter,

13:26.920 --> 13:31.920
you know, integrating function, and a perspectival pluralistic

13:31.920 --> 13:36.000
diverse shift that affords sort of this dynamic interrelation,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.200
which of course, sort of just makes sense in my system, you're

13:38.200 --> 13:41.320
going to have different entities coming up as specializing

13:41.320 --> 13:45.640
different elements, okay, of some sort of potentially shared

13:45.640 --> 13:50.680
ground. All right. And then what was before was sort of like

13:50.720 --> 13:54.040
an argument that you're going to build a system of justification

13:54.240 --> 13:56.920
that maps the territory, and then kind of is a pristine

13:56.920 --> 14:00.040
modernist notion. Okay, if we think about this, oh, we're

14:00.040 --> 14:02.760
gonna, it has to be reasoned in this based on accuracy, and

14:02.760 --> 14:05.440
this based on analysis, and it's going to have truth value or

14:05.440 --> 14:08.640
not, and it's going to be in competition with others, and then

14:08.640 --> 14:11.640
they'll battle and maybe break up. But really, I just see them

14:11.640 --> 14:15.880
basically sitting there as independent paradigms, okay, as

14:16.040 --> 14:18.840
they're making truth claims. You then they get the post modern

14:18.840 --> 14:22.040
structure coming along and critiquing, which basically says,

14:22.040 --> 14:25.920
Oh, all of that is imminent contextual justification, meaning

14:25.920 --> 14:29.040
you guys are saying you're developing your pure systems,

14:29.040 --> 14:32.440
right? But really, you're it's your, you know, we think Nietzsche

14:32.440 --> 14:34.280
is the first postmodern, you know, it's your it's the

14:34.280 --> 14:38.320
psychology, the philosophers 90% of the goddamn system. Okay,

14:38.600 --> 14:41.120
it's all just a justification of whatever dynamics they're

14:41.120 --> 14:43.480
dealing with, they say it's some pristine metaphysics, but

14:43.480 --> 14:46.560
it's basically their perspective in the world, right? And then we

14:46.600 --> 14:50.000
can extrapolate that to the to a crass postmodern view is like

14:50.000 --> 14:53.640
it's all fucking justification, it's all just a, you know, imminent

14:53.640 --> 14:56.400
context of power and justification. And there's no

14:56.400 --> 14:59.760
ground upon which you would then, you know, afford any

14:59.760 --> 15:03.040
legitimizing function, which then of course, in its extreme,

15:03.200 --> 15:06.200
says, Well, there's no, there's no claims to be made at all,

15:06.200 --> 15:09.480
and all relatively equal, etc. And then of course, that's kind

15:09.480 --> 15:12.920
of absurd. Right. And so the integrative plural meta modern

15:12.920 --> 15:16.640
integrative pluralistic sensibility is, Hey, we all are

15:16.640 --> 15:20.120
aspecializing different, you know, pieces of the elephant in a

15:20.120 --> 15:23.400
particular kind of way, right? The, you know, the blind men in

15:23.400 --> 15:26.200
the elephant metaphor, we're going to aspecialize, we're

15:26.200 --> 15:29.240
going to see various elements. And then we were going to weave

15:29.240 --> 15:33.440
together and see how these synergistically, pluralistic

15:33.560 --> 15:37.160
perspectives may afford a coherent, integrated

15:37.160 --> 15:41.720
understanding, and appreciate the diversity while also having a

15:41.720 --> 15:46.000
shared context of richness and growth. And that, that

15:46.000 --> 15:50.320
sensibility seems to me to be far superior in a synthetic

15:50.320 --> 15:53.400
synthesis, hegelian sort of way from modernity, and its

15:53.400 --> 15:57.160
justification, rationality, and postmodernity is at all

15:57.160 --> 16:01.840
justification, context BS, to an integrated pluralism that then

16:01.840 --> 16:04.920
affords a collective intelligence sense making,

16:04.920 --> 16:09.800
especially if we add the zoomed eologos to it. So zoomed eologos,

16:09.920 --> 16:13.280
unlike the old where you had to just write shit, right? Like

16:13.280 --> 16:14.480
as I'm a someone academic,

16:15.240 --> 16:18.320
like this thing right here, like this right here zoomed eologos

16:18.320 --> 16:21.960
is like, so I can now call Benita. So in the old days, if we

16:21.960 --> 16:24.560
were both academics, I'd publish something and then she

16:24.560 --> 16:28.320
would publish a critique of my metasystemic structure, because

16:28.320 --> 16:31.560
it's the wrong direction to go. Right? And then I'm like, Oh,

16:31.600 --> 16:35.960
God, you know, now I have to gain a that thing, and undermine

16:35.960 --> 16:39.760
that and justify why my justification system in writing

16:39.800 --> 16:43.960
in a context of competition of, you know, Swords of academia,

16:44.160 --> 16:46.080
right? And now it's like, Oh, call somebody and be like,

16:46.080 --> 16:48.640
actually, that's true in some ways, but that's not my full

16:48.640 --> 16:51.080
emphasis. And I love the fact that you're going that way. And

16:51.080 --> 16:53.880
actually, Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Because actually, I think this

16:53.880 --> 16:56.800
is good. And this is really complimentary. Oh, so a face to

16:56.800 --> 17:01.080
face de logos that affords the capacity to, you know, have an

17:01.080 --> 17:04.880
oral indigenous relationship, feedback on each other, make

17:04.880 --> 17:08.480
corrections immediately in real time, it's totally different

17:08.640 --> 17:13.520
than the old game of refined publication, so that you get a

17:13.520 --> 17:16.280
defense of a particular persistent in writing, where

17:16.280 --> 17:19.760
you're basically, there's no iterative, immediate feedback

17:19.800 --> 17:23.800
process, which is a dialogue is so unbelievably good at. So it's

17:23.800 --> 17:28.000
a real, this de logos thing from an academic perspective, and

17:28.000 --> 17:31.120
affording this capacity to build rich relations and an

17:31.120 --> 17:33.800
integrative pluralistic understanding. It's a, it's a

17:33.840 --> 17:37.240
the now we can build on some of the digital metaverse shed as a

17:37.240 --> 17:40.720
game as a as a medium potential game changer, if we can turn it

17:40.720 --> 17:43.040
into a strength. And I think, right, one of the things that

17:43.040 --> 17:47.240
afford them. So as an exercise, hold on one second.

17:54.680 --> 17:59.200
There we go. Okay, as an exercise in tough effort and

17:59.200 --> 18:05.320
virtuality. I will act, this is the old internet ping, I will

18:05.320 --> 18:10.480
act or I will take the what you just provided, I will metabolize

18:10.480 --> 18:15.320
it and I will not bomb it, but articulate express back out

18:15.320 --> 18:19.880
something. But the point, the meta point is then to say, Okay,

18:19.880 --> 18:25.520
cool, we're doing is we're orienting in a trans to use for

18:25.520 --> 18:31.000
specific language, transcendent location, by means of the real

18:31.000 --> 18:36.800
relationality of this zoom de logos environment, and the sort

18:36.800 --> 18:41.640
of pointer complex, right of the semantic terms that we happen

18:41.640 --> 18:46.640
to be using in broadly speaking share. So couple points like

18:46.640 --> 18:51.680
one point is the role of media. And you mentioned that in the

18:51.680 --> 18:56.200
old days, we might even say modernity is a consequence of

18:56.240 --> 18:59.960
books, the consequence of print, both as an opportunity and a

18:59.960 --> 19:04.600
constraint, right, you could now communicate with a much larger

19:04.600 --> 19:08.280
group of people over a longer period of time than just the

19:08.280 --> 19:11.400
local individuals you could interact with in conversation.

19:12.400 --> 19:16.240
But you couldn't have the context relevance, right, the

19:16.240 --> 19:21.040
relational possibilities, both at the EQ level, as well as in

19:21.080 --> 19:23.560
terms of just the semantic requirements of what what context

19:23.560 --> 19:28.760
provides, right? So you were this new milieu of that sort of

19:28.760 --> 19:32.200
behavior, that sort of justification system that was

19:32.200 --> 19:39.000
selected for effectiveness in the context of book became a kind

19:39.000 --> 19:43.440
of artifact that began to generate and attract human

19:43.440 --> 19:47.240
attention and energy, and to coordinate more and more choices

19:47.240 --> 19:50.520
and behaviors to the degree to which we're beginning to explore

19:50.520 --> 19:53.360
the potentials that that afforded, which of course, we're

19:53.360 --> 19:56.840
many, right? For example, much of the scientific enterprise is no

19:56.840 --> 20:00.040
more or less than the fact that you can begin to collaborate with

20:00.040 --> 20:03.240
people that you don't know by means of appropriately structured

20:03.240 --> 20:09.160
text. And concepts like peer review, much maligned in some

20:09.320 --> 20:12.800
quarters, which appropriately, are basically just a simple

20:12.800 --> 20:14.600
technology to say, Okay, well, how do we deal with the

20:14.640 --> 20:19.120
problems and the possibilities of decontextualized, relatively

20:19.120 --> 20:23.760
broadcast, you know, tight semantic articulations. Okay,

20:23.760 --> 20:27.400
cool. That's one, two.

20:33.960 --> 20:43.200
The this notion of the in the larger context, many of the

20:43.200 --> 20:47.600
things are happening. We have people are having kids, people

20:47.600 --> 20:52.040
are making money. More specifically, there's this

20:52.040 --> 20:56.080
wave that's been going on. And by the way, now I'm back back at

20:56.080 --> 20:59.040
like Gutenberg, roughly speaking. So that's okay. Okay.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.480
People were people were fighting fights, people were

21:05.200 --> 21:08.160
conquering, that's the better word for conquering and defending

21:08.160 --> 21:11.280
territory. It was that was already happening. That was a

21:11.280 --> 21:14.240
whole wave. It was kind of its own sort of movement to it. And

21:14.240 --> 21:18.080
books enters into this field. And it changes the terms of that

21:18.080 --> 21:23.800
field, and does not sort of cause it or cause it to disappear.

21:23.960 --> 21:30.400
But the form of the kingdom that is appropriate and possible in a

21:30.400 --> 21:33.760
pre literate environment is not the form of a kingdom that is

21:33.760 --> 21:36.560
possible and appropriate in a post literate environment, and

21:36.560 --> 21:41.920
the ability to send dispatches that can communicate to further

21:41.960 --> 21:46.200
governors, right? The British Empire was was produced as the

21:46.200 --> 21:48.800
consequence of the ability to actually figure out how could you

21:48.800 --> 21:53.480
effectively coordinate and deploy force and power economically,

21:53.520 --> 21:57.640
diplomatically and kinetically, by means of the written word.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.200
That's what it is. There's an organ for doing that kind of

22:01.200 --> 22:06.280
thing. So we say, you know, we're in the process of a

22:06.280 --> 22:10.000
technological disruption, at least as significant as the

22:10.000 --> 22:13.880
book, obviously, I would say much more so. One affordance of

22:13.880 --> 22:17.200
which is this notion of real time, highly contextual, high

22:17.200 --> 22:20.960
relational conversation, zoom theologous. I like, by the way,

22:20.960 --> 22:23.760
the implication of zoom is a as an adjective as well as a now.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.560
Restrains is the state of the game. And we don't we don't

22:29.560 --> 22:32.240
have to engage in the kinds of things that happen in the in

22:32.240 --> 22:36.320
the decontextualized written word form, we can engage can and

22:36.320 --> 22:39.680
should and will inevitably will engage in a different

22:39.760 --> 22:43.720
style of interaction. Right. And it gives rise to a completely

22:43.720 --> 22:48.040
different form of coordination, which is now well understood in

22:48.040 --> 22:50.600
the in the thing named Web three, they don't yet I don't

22:50.600 --> 22:53.920
think understand why, like what they're actually in service to,

22:54.360 --> 22:57.680
or what is the real potential? What is the what are the design

22:57.680 --> 23:00.040
characteristics of what the potential looks like on its

23:00.040 --> 23:02.600
interior as it develops? But they're aware of the fact that

23:02.600 --> 23:05.080
they are actually dealing with a new level of coordination and

23:05.080 --> 23:11.080
that portends much back to Rebel Alliance and stealing a wind

23:11.080 --> 23:17.920
here in the winning seconds. Right. Okay, hold on. Ah, and so

23:18.280 --> 23:25.600
and much of the criticism of postmodernism is the correct is

23:25.600 --> 23:27.560
accurate. There is a

23:30.440 --> 23:33.960
intrinsic. It's fun. I'll just use the language from post

23:33.960 --> 23:37.920
modern intrinsic totalizing characteristic that is associated

23:37.920 --> 23:44.320
with the model or the approach of book, right of written of

23:44.320 --> 23:48.560
written word, which is it's sort of because the rate of

23:48.560 --> 23:52.040
communication, the contact, the contact decontextualization of

23:52.040 --> 23:59.200
it. There's a need actually to form a paradigm, right. The

23:59.200 --> 24:01.960
paradigm is an artifact of this point in time, I would say.

24:02.200 --> 24:08.400
Hmm. Yeah, I'm gonna propose that as that's a yes. This is

24:08.400 --> 24:10.360
actually by the way, I had this title a long time ago, but I

24:10.360 --> 24:15.280
sort of embedded Kuhn inside Foucault. And so Foucault's

24:15.280 --> 24:18.800
concept of the episteme is more fundamental than Kuhn's concept

24:18.800 --> 24:22.480
of the paradigm. That the paradigm is a form appropriate to

24:22.480 --> 24:27.720
the episteme of the moment of that. Nice. I could totally see

24:27.760 --> 24:32.320
that. Yep. And it has to do with things like the the

24:32.320 --> 24:36.720
translation cost of different kinds of language. If I'm

24:36.720 --> 24:42.040
building a new same doing just like chemistry. And I've got

24:42.040 --> 24:44.760
terms in chemistry that other people people don't know. And

24:44.760 --> 24:49.120
it's costly to learn a new term. It's not not trivial. I'm very

24:49.120 --> 24:52.320
confusing if you don't know what the terms mean. Right. And so

24:52.320 --> 24:56.440
that's people trying to learn this thing. Yeah, exactly. To

24:56.480 --> 24:58.840
the point, let's hold that actually as a good model. So the

24:58.840 --> 25:01.520
old fashioned way of doing it is you create a dictionary. I

25:01.520 --> 25:03.680
need to okay, well, here's the official fucking meaning of the

25:03.680 --> 25:06.640
terms. If you need to know what they mean, go here. We've

25:06.640 --> 25:10.720
created a formal totalizing centralized construct that has

25:10.720 --> 25:14.840
hierarchical domination over the meanings of these words. If you

25:14.840 --> 25:17.960
disagree, fuck you, you're out of the team, you're not on the on

25:17.960 --> 25:20.440
the on the board. And here's what it looks like. But if we all

25:20.440 --> 25:24.920
agree to this sort of finite construct, then we can coordinate

25:24.920 --> 25:29.040
using these hyper decontextualized written

25:29.040 --> 25:31.600
constructs. If you haven't got any context, you can't be like,

25:31.600 --> 25:33.600
wait a minute, hold on. What do you mean by that? That sounds

25:33.600 --> 25:37.040
sound weird to me. If you can't do that at all, then you

25:37.040 --> 25:40.320
literally either you just don't communicate, or you have to have

25:40.320 --> 25:44.040
some kind of totalizing construct that defines what is valid

25:44.040 --> 25:46.400
discourse within a particular paradigmatic frame, right?

25:48.200 --> 25:50.720
Just the consequence, there's no sort of here nor there. That's

25:50.720 --> 25:54.880
just what happens. And similarly, that same thing works

25:54.960 --> 25:58.720
to the level of political power. If I want to be able to

25:58.720 --> 26:04.440
effectively coordinate economic, financial, kinetic, diplomatic

26:04.440 --> 26:07.920
energy across some spatial location, I have to have a

26:07.920 --> 26:11.000
defined after control the definitions of the meanings of

26:11.000 --> 26:14.240
the words within that particular communications, a milieu.

26:14.800 --> 26:18.240
Otherwise, you know, I'm saying you sell the guy on the other

26:18.240 --> 26:20.520
side, it's like, Oh, that means buy, doesn't work, right? You

26:20.520 --> 26:22.680
have to have agreement. What do we mean? We all have to have a

26:22.680 --> 26:26.200
shared dictionary of what terms mean within some level of

26:26.200 --> 26:28.360
rigor, right? And that of course, requires that each sort of

26:28.360 --> 26:30.680
sphere of influence, which largely, of course, became

26:30.680 --> 26:34.320
linguistic. You know, the notion of a nation is being

26:34.320 --> 26:38.040
effectively the playing out of a particular linguistic, and

26:38.040 --> 26:40.840
therefore, ethno cultural, but linguistic constraint. And

26:40.840 --> 26:44.640
remember, the French formally, now have a formal institute that

26:44.640 --> 26:48.760
is nothing but precisely defined every single word. They

26:48.760 --> 26:52.280
kind of got the essence of it pretty precisely. That's just

26:52.400 --> 26:55.560
how it works out. And so then, of course, as you say, we end up

26:55.560 --> 26:58.600
kind of in this wrestling match of no, no, no, my definitions are

26:58.600 --> 27:01.880
more right than your definitions, or our right and your

27:01.880 --> 27:04.920
definitions are wrong. And therefore, you have to play on

27:04.920 --> 27:09.720
my turf, because I don't want to be playing in your turf. And,

27:09.760 --> 27:14.600
you know, the strict kind of subordinate construct, which

27:14.600 --> 27:19.120
makes people a little bit, which gives right, like, individual

27:19.440 --> 27:24.320
versus collectivist. And a collectivist relationship is

27:24.320 --> 27:30.120
precisely the subordination of my experiences, my meaning, my

27:30.120 --> 27:34.880
understanding to some kind of formal construct that is

27:34.880 --> 27:40.240
necessary for shared communication. Hold on. So I can

27:40.240 --> 27:41.600
make this less choppy.

27:44.080 --> 27:47.200
The right network, the right network. Alright, well, you can do

27:50.120 --> 27:51.600
it. Okay, so

27:54.840 --> 27:59.240
so then we end up with the new thing, this new milieu, new

27:59.240 --> 28:02.960
possibilities. It sits on top of the old. So one thing is that

28:02.960 --> 28:05.040
we're part of the part of the essence of the new is that the

28:05.040 --> 28:07.920
old happened, we're aware of it. It's not going to benefit from

28:08.280 --> 28:10.960
okay, God, I understand all that that was part of how things

28:10.960 --> 28:14.160
happen. I kind of learn those lessons as humans tend to the

28:14.160 --> 28:17.600
hard way. Okay. And we're sitting in a very different

28:17.600 --> 28:25.160
potential. If I have not only, you know, the tension, not only

28:25.160 --> 28:29.840
can I call you and disambiguate and have relational context, but

28:29.840 --> 28:36.080
also, I have to because the power, the possibility of some sort

28:36.080 --> 28:40.360
of formal, man, this is a pain. What's happening? Why is that

28:40.360 --> 28:43.240
happening? I'm seeing you like, oh, on and off, just like

28:43.240 --> 28:46.120
completely red. Are you having the same thing on my end?

28:48.480 --> 28:52.400
But I'm having a bit of your, yeah, you're, I mean, I'm

28:52.440 --> 28:55.360
definitely tracking you, but it's, we got it, we have some

28:55.360 --> 28:56.040
interference.

28:56.680 --> 29:00.680
I don't know. On my end, everything seems very strong.

29:02.360 --> 29:04.360
Shift to a different network.

29:17.800 --> 29:24.000
Okay, let's see if that makes a difference. So far, nope, not at

29:24.000 --> 29:28.640
all. It may be on your end. So let's see.

29:31.800 --> 29:36.560
Right. So not only can I now engage in a zoom to your logos

29:36.560 --> 29:41.320
when there's a moment of ambiguity, but also in fact,

29:41.440 --> 29:46.560
have to because everybody's involved in the conversation.

29:47.400 --> 29:47.960
We

29:52.840 --> 29:55.440
I'm gonna terminate the call and start it.

29:56.160 --> 29:59.680
Perfect. Do you want, do you want to send me a zoom link on

29:59.760 --> 30:01.360
send you send me a zoom link? Okay.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.960
Yeah, to the point, every, every new thing has its own

30:08.960 --> 30:09.640
pluses in mind.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.320
Well, there's many, right? If you take a look at how Twitter

30:15.320 --> 30:18.840
operates. So what are the, what my, the point I was making

30:18.840 --> 30:21.160
earlier is that we now, of course, this is the story of the

30:21.160 --> 30:26.040
building up the internet. We have this. Oh, come on.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.240
Are you still there?

30:29.560 --> 30:30.640
Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.360
Okay. My computer. There we go. Okay.

30:36.560 --> 30:40.120
What do they call it back like back in the late 90s and early

30:40.120 --> 30:43.120
2000s, like, you know, everybody has a printing press, that

30:43.120 --> 30:46.560
kind of a thing. Free channels on TV 2000 channels to now

30:46.560 --> 30:50.200
everybody at that point. The idea that in Twitter, everybody

30:50.200 --> 30:53.280
is somewhat symmetric in their capacity to participate in the

30:53.280 --> 30:55.920
conversation. They're not, no, actually, because number of

30:55.920 --> 30:58.800
followers and algorithmic, throttling and things like

30:58.800 --> 31:02.680
that. But it's a different environment, which means the

31:02.760 --> 31:06.200
the tech, this is back to one of my feces, right? The notion

31:06.200 --> 31:08.800
the, the technology, the institutional framework of the

31:08.800 --> 31:15.320
Blue Church, which evolved to regulate the mechanics of

31:15.320 --> 31:20.040
coordination and paradigmatic formation in the context of mass

31:20.040 --> 31:24.280
media communication, right? Breaks down has broken down and is

31:24.280 --> 31:28.560
accelerating in this breakdown. Because it wasn't evolved for

31:28.560 --> 31:32.000
this particular environment, this needs to be so we're in the

31:32.000 --> 31:35.600
process, successfully or not, of course, you can always fail to

31:35.600 --> 31:40.920
adapt to your niche of evolving a new form of how we do this

31:40.920 --> 31:43.760
sort of thing in this in this new potential in this new

31:43.760 --> 31:47.920
environment. And to loop all the way back, this new environment

31:47.920 --> 31:51.440
is one that you're calling sometimes coherent, integrative

31:51.760 --> 31:57.560
pluralism. And it has characteristics of neither

31:57.560 --> 32:02.840
needing or requiring a subordination on the part of

32:02.880 --> 32:06.840
members of the dialogue. I'm not playing your game, you're not

32:06.840 --> 32:09.880
playing my game, we are afforded the possibility and the

32:09.880 --> 32:13.840
potential of producing a novel game bespoke, right? Every

32:13.840 --> 32:18.360
relationship is its own play, which has as a consequence, the

32:18.360 --> 32:22.640
enriching of both of our games intrinsically, totally, which is

32:22.640 --> 32:27.440
why we continue to play. And I would say meta enriching, because

32:27.440 --> 32:33.000
it's that underlying piece is so powerful, and also synergistic

32:33.000 --> 32:37.720
value, or we call it the anti rivalrous consequence that as you

32:37.720 --> 32:41.360
and I, for example, play in this way, and thereby enrich our own

32:41.480 --> 32:45.400
capacities, it produces a higher degree of potential in every

32:45.400 --> 32:50.640
other possible game we might play. Totally. So by talking with

32:50.640 --> 32:53.520
Greg, I actually becoming more valuable player in the larger

32:53.520 --> 32:56.560
game for literally everybody else. And if you sort of just

32:56.600 --> 33:00.040
multiply that out, that gets from a process perspective, the

33:00.040 --> 33:04.360
shape of that curve is very steep. It's absurdly steep,

33:04.360 --> 33:06.800
actually. This begs the question of the singularity, we'll

33:06.800 --> 33:07.640
ignore that for the moment.

33:10.240 --> 33:14.560
So let's see. So, so I'll just so just to riff off that a little

33:14.560 --> 33:18.480
bit. If I put it a little bit in Utah language, where most the

33:18.480 --> 33:22.600
old relationship, the systems of justification that we operate

33:22.720 --> 33:28.000
under, and our subordinate to. And now, and then so you get

33:28.000 --> 33:31.080
modernity, you get the basically the tribe, and then the

33:31.080 --> 33:34.360
civilization, and then it's, it's dictating into traditional

33:34.360 --> 33:37.280
civilization. And then we get into refined knowledge, and we

33:37.280 --> 33:40.720
get science, but modernity is still basically creating systems

33:40.720 --> 33:44.240
of justification that you're subordinate to at various levels.

33:44.280 --> 33:47.680
Yeah. Postmodern sort of comes along and says, Well, it's all

33:47.680 --> 33:50.720
power, but it's still basically then like a battle of

33:50.720 --> 33:54.200
justification in a particular way. We are actually now at a

33:54.200 --> 33:57.720
place to, we're not going to like teleport out of justification,

33:57.720 --> 34:00.480
but we can get adjacent to justification in a different kind

34:00.480 --> 34:04.160
of way. Again, we can relate to these systems of justification

34:04.320 --> 34:08.240
through, Oh, here you are as specializing in a particular

34:08.560 --> 34:12.040
part of the whole, you know, through your narrative and

34:12.280 --> 34:16.160
propositional structure, and I can relate to you where you are in

34:16.160 --> 34:19.560
that, and then I share where I am in that. And now rather than

34:19.560 --> 34:22.360
trying to then think about, Okay, there are no point of

34:22.360 --> 34:25.200
justification, or we're going to subordinate ourselves, we're

34:25.200 --> 34:28.160
going to be like, Oh, we're an integrated pluralistic system

34:28.160 --> 34:32.360
of justification that we can be adjacent to participate in, but

34:32.360 --> 34:34.800
not necessarily force some sort of

34:35.280 --> 34:40.000
Yeah. And there's a sort of your definition of ego, what the ego

34:40.000 --> 34:43.480
is, right? We have a bit of a historical ambiguity, you know,

34:43.480 --> 34:45.800
Freud uses it differently than the Buddhists do. So we're going

34:45.800 --> 34:48.680
to use the, the Greg and Rick has version of it, which I quite

34:48.680 --> 34:53.280
like, which is the kind of the human neurocognitive faculty for

34:53.280 --> 35:00.080
producing systems of justification. Exactly. Great. And the sort

35:00.080 --> 35:04.440
of the classic problem is the one where you yourself subordinate

35:04.440 --> 35:09.520
yourself to your own ego, right? The ego self inversion. Yep.

35:10.280 --> 35:13.280
And the social version of that is the same kind of thing, right?

35:13.280 --> 35:16.560
So if Jordan's ego is interacting with Greg's ego, and

35:16.560 --> 35:19.320
Jordan's ego is subordinating Jordan's self and Greg's ego

35:19.320 --> 35:22.320
is subordinating Greg's self, boom, we're locked into this

35:22.320 --> 35:26.040
entire set of cascade effects that produce these sort of

35:26.040 --> 35:29.960
dominant structures. This is by the way, a very clean way of

35:29.960 --> 35:32.040
describing the transformation into game A, from my

35:32.040 --> 35:35.680
perspective. Totally. Okay. So what we're noticing is that we

35:35.680 --> 35:38.640
can notice that there's an individual version of this

35:38.640 --> 35:42.080
form of just proper relationship. Oh, systems of

35:42.080 --> 35:46.040
justification are a thing. Nice. But that's the whole thing.

35:47.040 --> 35:49.320
Right there. They're a map. They're not the territory. And

35:49.320 --> 35:52.760
there is a territory. How do I know? Well, the ego is a thing.

35:52.880 --> 35:56.160
It's not the whole thing. There's a self. How do I know? Because

35:56.160 --> 35:59.840
I do. You know, I can just, here I am, there's a self I can

35:59.840 --> 36:03.080
begin to get very, very clean distinction of distinctions

36:03.080 --> 36:06.040
between them by a variety of practices. In my case, it happened

36:06.040 --> 36:11.440
to be meditation. And, and, okay, well, that affords us a

36:11.440 --> 36:14.280
whole new possibility. We no longer have to imagine that this

36:14.320 --> 36:19.080
game is just a kind of a winner takes all slugfest of power,

36:19.360 --> 36:24.680
manipulation, and justification. But actually, there's, there's a

36:24.680 --> 36:28.720
ground, there's a self, systems of justification or a tool for

36:28.720 --> 36:32.560
coordination between things that are outside of the scope of

36:32.560 --> 36:36.120
the systems of justification, like say, that's true, and humans.

36:37.480 --> 36:40.720
Really? This back, by the way, to the fork transhumanism in this

36:40.720 --> 36:44.120
other thing. Yes, right. And I would then say, what modernity

36:44.160 --> 36:47.120
did, and then capital labor relations created a system of

36:47.120 --> 36:49.600
justification, skits into the conversation outside of the

36:49.600 --> 36:52.400
forest, systems of justification that then are

36:52.400 --> 36:56.040
instrumental result in a power law distribution of influence in

36:56.040 --> 37:00.840
a particular kind of way. And that fundamentally miscalibrates

37:00.840 --> 37:04.080
the actual heart, which actually should be ideally

37:04.080 --> 37:08.040
calibrated on relational value rather than social influence.

37:08.280 --> 37:13.600
And one of our tasks in this transformation is to recalibrate

37:13.600 --> 37:17.520
a power law distribution of influence into a more Gaussian

37:17.520 --> 37:20.920
distribution of relational value, and connection in that

37:20.920 --> 37:24.000
regard. So in terms of the kinds of moves that we want to be

37:24.000 --> 37:27.440
making, relative to modernity, we want to get adjacent to our

37:27.440 --> 37:29.920
justification, see the monsters that we created and all the

37:29.920 --> 37:33.720
power that they did, diagnose them in a particular way, and

37:33.720 --> 37:36.960
then rotate, you know, that if we're able to weave this

37:36.960 --> 37:39.560
together, this will afford us the capacity to win this game.

37:39.760 --> 37:43.160
Yep. Okay, so I want to double click on that. It's a

37:43.160 --> 37:47.120
profoundly powerful construct in insight. Again, one of these

37:47.120 --> 37:50.200
things that enables us to be liberated from things that in

37:50.200 --> 37:57.000
many ways can be depressing constraints. So what you just

37:57.000 --> 38:03.560
said is something like this. Pareto distributions are yes,

38:03.560 --> 38:09.160
they happen. But they're an artifact of a particular form of

38:09.160 --> 38:13.560
social relationship. So if you have a social relationship that

38:13.560 --> 38:15.480
operates in a certain way, which I just call it, call it

38:15.640 --> 38:21.800
society, society, we can sort of describe that in more detail,

38:21.800 --> 38:25.720
if you have a society, then you're going to have Pareto

38:25.720 --> 38:32.720
distributions of social relationships, kind of done. But

38:32.960 --> 38:34.720
that's not the only kind of relationality. In fact, it's

38:34.720 --> 38:37.680
even not even the more fundamental, but the more basic,

38:37.720 --> 38:40.520
more fundamental kind of relationality, which I just

38:40.520 --> 38:45.600
call community, just to make a distinction, doesn't have a

38:45.600 --> 38:49.560
Pareto distribution as its equilibrium, right, as a Gaussian

38:49.560 --> 38:55.000
distribution as its equilibrium. If you can land on that, like

38:55.000 --> 38:57.680
if you're a person who spends time in places like economics or

38:57.680 --> 39:01.680
in politics, you care about justice, this fact, this

39:01.680 --> 39:06.720
distinction is super profound. It describes the fact that

39:06.720 --> 39:12.840
there is there's a way to achieve a kind of quality of

39:12.840 --> 39:19.880
relationship that we would define as, say, justice or fairness

39:19.960 --> 39:26.160
or equity. There's an actual way to get there, right? You

39:26.160 --> 39:30.320
can't get there staying inside the form of society. If you

39:30.320 --> 39:33.040
stay inside the form of society, you're never going to get

39:33.040 --> 39:36.760
there. It's not a thing. You have to go down and over into this

39:36.760 --> 39:39.640
other form. But once you get to this other form, not only is it

39:39.640 --> 39:43.000
possible, it's actually equilibrium state. And that's

39:43.000 --> 39:46.160
there. That's the power of this approach of being able to say,

39:46.160 --> 39:50.680
okay, I agree. We don't like this particular structure, this way

39:50.680 --> 39:56.760
this structure plays out. But how is this like, what is it? Say

39:56.760 --> 40:00.400
hello to the new boss, same as the old boss. If you think that

40:00.400 --> 40:02.400
just by killing the king and installing yourself as king,

40:02.440 --> 40:04.600
you're changing the nature, you're not. But there is a

40:04.600 --> 40:07.360
different place. And it's not imaginary, right? It's not the

40:07.360 --> 40:13.040
kind of the communist mid century, you know, failure of oh, not

40:13.040 --> 40:15.480
getting the thing and there's a place. So let's just talk about

40:15.480 --> 40:19.440
like, why is there a Pareto distribution in this thing I'm

40:19.440 --> 40:22.320
calling society? What do I when I say society, what is it? I'm

40:22.320 --> 40:23.400
really talking about what do I mean?

40:24.160 --> 40:24.480
Yeah.

40:25.520 --> 40:30.360
First off, the lovely yeah, I mean, the short answer. One short

40:30.360 --> 40:34.840
answer is money and influence beget money and influence. Okay.

40:35.600 --> 40:39.160
So as you have more opportunity to gain control, and there are

40:39.160 --> 40:42.480
lots of different that this Pareto distribution basically is

40:42.480 --> 40:46.240
that a small number of individuals acquire an enormous

40:46.240 --> 40:49.480
disproportionality of influence and control, okay, and a power

40:49.480 --> 40:52.200
kind of law distribution. So for folks that don't know what

40:52.200 --> 40:54.440
that is, that's that's the essence of it. And then it

40:54.440 --> 40:57.640
creates a massive inequality. And we have seen that in our

40:57.640 --> 41:01.760
society. And virtually any context in any societal

41:01.760 --> 41:05.080
organization tends to drift into these Pareto distributions,

41:05.200 --> 41:07.600
they're very difficult to prevent there's a and there are

41:07.600 --> 41:10.480
reasons why that we don't we can dialogue about but I don't know

41:10.480 --> 41:15.040
that that's crucial. For me, the issue is that when you get this

41:15.040 --> 41:18.720
that's going to create all sorts of problems. Okay, the focus is

41:18.720 --> 41:22.440
on influence of our modernity, we create capital labor, what

41:22.440 --> 41:25.200
we're basically trying to do is actually observable work

41:25.200 --> 41:28.800
effort, and our science orient us in this perspective, which I

41:28.800 --> 41:31.160
think is a deep mistake. One of the things that are enlightenment

41:31.160 --> 41:35.040
is that we don't get human nature right here. And we can talk

41:35.040 --> 41:37.720
about what the distinction is my own history of social influence,

41:37.720 --> 41:41.200
relational value, etc. But it's the felt sense of being known in

41:41.200 --> 41:44.200
value, it is our core, that's crucial, we certainly track

41:44.200 --> 41:47.280
social influence. But that's another aspect. And we miss this

41:47.280 --> 41:50.040
psychology misses this, the humanists sort of get it. But

41:50.040 --> 41:54.080
anyway, the point what you made, we can actually see in the

41:54.080 --> 41:56.960
world, I want to be people, all you need to do is you go back to

41:56.960 --> 42:01.040
hunter gather oral indigenous structures, the vast majority of

42:01.040 --> 42:04.120
oral indigenous structures are about building community. Okay,

42:04.360 --> 42:08.840
and guess what, narcissistic ego shit is regulated deeply in

42:08.840 --> 42:12.600
that structure, they do not want people pulling out what's

42:12.600 --> 42:15.480
called the blue line on the in on the influence makes I'm

42:15.480 --> 42:18.240
superior, and I'm going to egoically control your ass

42:18.240 --> 42:21.800
through power. They regulate that virtually every community

42:21.840 --> 42:26.160
society figures out structures to regulate it. Okay, so then what

42:26.160 --> 42:31.480
happens is we basically release that thing in game a world, we

42:31.480 --> 42:35.320
release that thing. The society and the Pareto distribution and

42:35.320 --> 42:38.000
nature, power and influence afford a capacity, even our

42:38.000 --> 42:41.680
justifications release that thing. So what we're saying is

42:41.680 --> 42:44.720
that they Oh, my God, if we then invest in that societal

42:44.720 --> 42:46.480
structure, in particular, well, that's what you get, you get

42:46.480 --> 42:50.000
game. And you can't just kill that you actually need to what is

42:50.000 --> 42:52.680
the kind of structure that's actually sustainable. Actually,

42:52.680 --> 42:54.880
if we look at this, and we actually create a particular

42:54.880 --> 42:59.080
type of oral indigenous DLO goes kind of dynamic that is a

42:59.080 --> 43:03.520
fundamentally different dynamic with this ego as power issue.

43:03.680 --> 43:06.760
Well, then maybe we have something serious going on here.

43:07.320 --> 43:10.040
Yeah, so what I would say, and I think you're going to agree

43:10.040 --> 43:13.320
with me on this is that the we've actually produced a lot of

43:13.320 --> 43:17.080
good language to describe the thing that I'm calling society,

43:17.680 --> 43:21.640
or precisely specifically the thing that more fundamental and

43:21.640 --> 43:27.080
calling game a, which has to do with the, the prioritization,

43:28.720 --> 43:31.640
almost obligate mediation of relationality by means of ego.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.640
That's a very clean way of articulating it. Now, what's

43:35.640 --> 43:38.640
happening there? Well, what's happening there is the ego at

43:38.640 --> 43:43.040
the end of the day is a finite state machine. If you if you

43:43.040 --> 43:45.320
understand that from a computational perspective, things

43:45.360 --> 43:49.720
lit up. Yeah, you think about money, right? Money is a finite

43:49.720 --> 43:54.200
state machine. It's very, you know, has a large amount of

43:54.400 --> 43:56.880
processing power. That's why it's functional. It's what what

43:56.880 --> 44:01.560
markets do, right markets are a massively parallel information

44:01.560 --> 44:07.080
processing machine. But it's a finite state machine. And ego

44:07.480 --> 44:10.960
works very functionally inside money, my ego connect quite

44:10.960 --> 44:13.960
nicely. There's a reason why they're very wide narcissistic

44:13.960 --> 44:18.280
ego ego personalities perform very well. And they tend to rise

44:18.280 --> 44:20.920
to the top of the predator distribution, the 80 20 rule is

44:20.920 --> 44:27.040
a common vernacular for that. When when one mediates complexity,

44:27.120 --> 44:32.200
when one mediates rich, highly contextualized relationships by

44:32.200 --> 44:35.560
means of the complicated by means of finite state machines,

44:35.600 --> 44:39.280
even very large ones, one is operating in the form that I am

44:39.280 --> 44:42.760
calling society, and therefore has by implication, for sure,

44:42.760 --> 44:46.640
guaranteed things like predator distributions. Yep. And for

44:46.640 --> 44:51.560
sure, guaranteed things like a infinite cascade effect in

44:51.560 --> 44:55.400
paradigmatic interrelational communication. Because you now

44:55.400 --> 44:58.240
have to find some way of doing some translation between your

44:58.240 --> 45:01.760
finite state machine and my finite state machine, which means

45:01.760 --> 45:04.800
that if I have a small deviation in the way that my state

45:04.800 --> 45:07.920
machine maps particular context from yours, we actually can't

45:07.920 --> 45:11.960
engage in any real communication, either I have to learn yours,

45:12.000 --> 45:15.640
which is what education has become education machine for

45:15.640 --> 45:21.520
stamping shared models on mines, which has an ancillary benefit,

45:22.240 --> 45:27.000
training cells to become egos, socialize them into the system.

45:27.920 --> 45:31.200
And of course, training egos to become narcissists, right? Of

45:31.200 --> 45:33.960
course, right. So it's not if you understand how these system

45:33.960 --> 45:36.400
dynamics work, it's not confusing how we got where we are. And

45:36.400 --> 45:39.400
frankly, where we are, where we are is like, Oh, yeah, I know

45:39.440 --> 45:44.080
where we are. And I know how we got here. And how we get out of

45:44.080 --> 45:47.520
it becomes, Oh, okay, to get out of it, as you say, we need to

45:47.520 --> 45:51.560
say human nature isn't the kind of thing that was written about

45:51.560 --> 45:55.520
in the Enlightenment, neither Rousseau nor Voltaire nor any

45:55.520 --> 45:59.360
of those guys were frankly close. We've got some pretty good

45:59.360 --> 46:01.680
ideas. More importantly, we've got good models. As you say, the

46:01.680 --> 46:03.960
oral indigenous cultures tell us what it looks like. And there

46:03.960 --> 46:06.520
it is, those are humans operating according to human nature,

46:06.520 --> 46:09.840
more or less. We can do a diff across a very large number and

46:09.840 --> 46:15.000
get a nice, you know, basic model. And now double clicking on my

46:15.160 --> 46:20.560
fork in the metaverse. And we're entering into a new milieu. We

46:20.560 --> 46:24.320
are in fact, both literate. We're not an oral culture, we're

46:24.320 --> 46:28.640
literate culture, decreasingly, and maybe that's the best. But

46:28.640 --> 46:33.200
we're also a zoom, theologous, zoom, theologous culture, almost

46:33.200 --> 46:37.880
certainly. I don't think that there's a path where we drop

46:37.880 --> 46:43.920
back down into a pre electrical civilization. Well, I mean,

46:44.920 --> 46:45.680
I don't like that.

46:47.360 --> 46:49.840
And land, there's a lot of paths where we do that, but we don't

46:49.840 --> 46:56.960
like it. Just keep going. Way, way past oral indigenous. But

46:57.120 --> 47:03.560
there is a path where we find this new higher tone of human

47:03.560 --> 47:07.760
nature, establishing right relationship with this thing, the

47:07.760 --> 47:11.720
virtual, the virtual per se. And this is the key. This is the

47:11.720 --> 47:13.880
point of the metaverse, the metaverse is where we actually

47:13.880 --> 47:18.560
look at the notion of technology in the eye directly.

47:18.840 --> 47:22.440
Exactly. We're not we're not looking at like a pair of eyeglasses.

47:22.720 --> 47:26.560
Right. We're not looking at a pen. Right. We're not even looking

47:26.640 --> 47:29.880
at a cell phone. Right. We're actually looking at the essence

47:29.880 --> 47:37.080
of technology directly. And asking, what's the relationship

47:37.080 --> 47:41.800
here? Because if you want to play the narcissist ego finite

47:41.800 --> 47:47.080
state machine game, AI wins. Yeah, better playing that than any

47:47.080 --> 47:50.360
human mind will ever be. And you know, Elon Musk's, Elon

47:50.360 --> 47:53.280
Musk's gambit is, well, let's just become AI, like the only

47:53.840 --> 47:56.880
thing in time for us to just do that. Which if if you don't have

47:56.880 --> 47:59.160
the rest of this theory, it's going to make sense. That's,

47:59.160 --> 48:03.000
that's what you'll get to. Our proposition is that no, there's

48:03.000 --> 48:07.360
actually a whole other kind of game that we can play. I want

48:07.360 --> 48:11.120
that it's not a relationship where we are operating and

48:11.120 --> 48:14.800
coordinating by means of ego, by means of systems of

48:14.800 --> 48:18.480
justification, where where systems of justification being a

48:18.480 --> 48:23.040
thing, where we're ego being a thing, but we're actually held

48:23.040 --> 48:27.680
in a much larger, richer, fully contextualized world called

48:27.680 --> 48:32.640
reality. And in reality, we can actually reposition

48:32.640 --> 48:34.520
technology in its proper location.

48:35.440 --> 48:36.520
Beautiful said.

48:38.360 --> 48:39.240
Easiest said to done.

48:41.920 --> 48:44.480
By winning win the game as a function of it, but it was

48:44.480 --> 48:45.640
brilliantly articulated.

48:45.680 --> 48:47.880
Right, right. This is the halftime, right? This coach

48:47.880 --> 48:50.280
would have to say, all right, all right, this is the

48:50.280 --> 48:51.160
halftime for me.

48:53.720 --> 48:56.200
Now there's there's a play that another game actually played

48:56.200 --> 48:58.880
out, but that's like that. That's how it was up, right? You

48:58.880 --> 49:04.200
got a team algorithm, right? Team, what do I call it one time

49:04.200 --> 49:06.760
called team godless communists, just to kind of use a nice

49:07.160 --> 49:10.200
entry Americana, which is just algorithm, just another way of

49:10.200 --> 49:13.640
saying the same thing, right? Team ego, team narcissists, team

49:13.640 --> 49:17.200
finite state machine, team society, team systems of

49:17.200 --> 49:20.160
domination, team can't get outside of your own system of

49:20.160 --> 49:23.200
justification and bullshit yourself into meaningless, right?

49:23.240 --> 49:26.960
It's all that team, right? We're on that side. Yep. And then

49:26.960 --> 49:34.760
team, human team, soul, team, self, team, context, team

49:34.760 --> 49:39.000
complexity, team, nature and technology in wholesome

49:39.000 --> 49:42.480
relationship, right? They're there in line. Totally. That's

49:42.480 --> 49:45.280
the fork. That's the fork of the metaverse, as I'm calling it.

49:45.400 --> 49:47.560
That's right. Calling it right now. That's the fork in the

49:47.560 --> 49:48.160
metaverse.

49:48.560 --> 49:56.240
And bing, bing, bing, as we said, the potency, the expansion

49:56.240 --> 50:00.800
of the field of possibility that emerges in this new kind of

50:00.800 --> 50:05.960
zoomed eologos, new form of generative, integrative

50:05.960 --> 50:08.800
pluralism is our secret weapon.

50:10.680 --> 50:15.560
And it's, yep, qualitatively vaster. It's a different order of

50:15.800 --> 50:21.880
infinity and is possible in principle in the algorithmic

50:21.880 --> 50:22.240
domain.

50:25.520 --> 50:31.280
Actually, yeah, so let me, let me, let me take a slight right

50:31.280 --> 50:34.920
turn and come back to this. Okay, because you said secret

50:34.920 --> 50:39.120
weapon, and I totally agree, but I want to add something, some

50:39.120 --> 50:44.440
things to that weapon. Okay. Which I, which part of through the

50:44.440 --> 50:48.120
integrative pluralism that I really feel is emerging is a

50:48.200 --> 50:51.040
the ground, the intellectual groundwork for a new enlightenment,

50:51.440 --> 50:55.440
which affords the intellectual architecture in addition, you

50:55.440 --> 51:00.120
know, to the sensibility and the media and the axioms and what

51:00.120 --> 51:06.040
not, in addition. So, so if, if we can also analytically

51:06.040 --> 51:10.720
diagnose the justificatory histories, okay, and demonstrate

51:10.720 --> 51:13.680
where the human nature shit got wrong, and what science did,

51:13.680 --> 51:16.600
and what that was wrong, and then upgrade it and say, Oh, well,

51:16.600 --> 51:19.080
now we know that was wrong. And now this is what right is in a

51:19.080 --> 51:23.640
way that, you know, a 15 year old can totally then narrate and

51:23.640 --> 51:27.360
understand with reliability and validity and clarity. Yeah. Okay.

51:27.440 --> 51:30.440
Then you're in a different kind of place in terms of what

51:30.600 --> 51:35.480
affords the capacity to spread the system, because if we can get

51:35.480 --> 51:39.360
it right, that the diagnosis and the upgrade analytically is

51:39.400 --> 51:43.960
clear as well as the cultural flavor. And then that affords not

51:43.960 --> 51:47.000
that we subordinate to it, but clear justification about what

51:47.000 --> 51:50.760
this path is relative to our past. And in a little way, that

51:50.760 --> 51:54.880
will afford additional momentum and capacity in getting our

51:54.880 --> 51:58.560
shit together. Yes, particularly among those for whom

51:58.560 --> 52:03.680
analytic. Exactly. Assessment is a key component, which is

52:03.680 --> 52:05.920
definitely not everybody, but but in relationship to a

52:05.920 --> 52:08.720
coordinating function, it could play a central coordinating

52:08.720 --> 52:13.640
function in relationship. Great. Yeah, I agree. The challenge,

52:13.640 --> 52:17.480
of course, and this is where why people like you and john play

52:17.640 --> 52:23.480
important role is ego defense, narcissism, various forms of

52:23.560 --> 52:30.920
fragile ego, and the unwillingness to, well, it's funny,

52:30.920 --> 52:33.920
not just let's just be very precise, the degree to which the

52:33.920 --> 52:38.360
ego has effectively colonized the self and protect its

52:38.400 --> 52:41.080
territory, using the technique you guys very good at using.

52:44.680 --> 52:49.160
So you know, if you happen to be an individual who is kind of

52:49.160 --> 52:53.840
afforded to analytical methodologies for perceiving and

52:53.840 --> 52:57.960
making sense of the world and then making choices, notice that

52:57.960 --> 53:05.600
this thing we're describing ego, you may have pwned you at some

53:05.640 --> 53:09.560
point in time. You may be particularly challenged in

53:09.600 --> 53:13.800
unponing yourself because your your your primary faculty, so

53:13.800 --> 53:17.800
this you this capacity to engage in this particular mode of

53:17.800 --> 53:23.400
thinking happens to be one that is particularly gameable by the

53:23.400 --> 53:27.680
ego. So you're sort of relying on something which itself

53:27.680 --> 53:30.480
doesn't have your best interests in mind, and lives inside you

53:30.480 --> 53:33.560
and uses your own, perhaps in some cases, tremendous

53:33.560 --> 53:39.400
capacity to justify to justify itself, which is what it does

53:39.400 --> 53:43.000
first and foremost, in all circumstances, the one thing it

53:43.000 --> 53:45.600
justifies more than anything else is that it's your best buddy

53:45.600 --> 53:50.160
and really needs to be in charge. And of course, complete all

53:50.160 --> 53:53.480
the various games of you know, fear and shame and depression

53:53.480 --> 53:56.240
on the other elements, right, it has fingers very firmly on

53:56.240 --> 53:58.640
buttons that it's surrounded with systems of justification in

53:58.640 --> 54:01.760
your interior. So for that portion, and here in many cases,

54:01.760 --> 54:04.720
I'm often speaking to technologists creating web

54:04.720 --> 54:08.840
three. Mm hmm. You got some work. You're gonna have to

54:08.840 --> 54:11.960
actually step through this particular portal. I can tell

54:11.960 --> 54:16.480
you, I'm of that type. And I saw this thought it through very

54:16.480 --> 54:20.240
clearly. And then bootstrap myself through the portal, to

54:20.240 --> 54:22.520
some extent, not particularly effectively, but better than

54:22.520 --> 54:26.160
zero. So it can be done. And I would say also should and must

54:26.160 --> 54:32.360
be done for path two, to be lift off, right? That's right

54:32.360 --> 54:36.000
there. What's the other piece of it?

54:40.640 --> 54:47.080
The analytic possibility. The other possibility, of course,

54:47.080 --> 54:51.600
just speaks to john's video series, the meaning crisis.

54:51.840 --> 54:56.360
Alright, this left hand side is just another way of saying the

54:56.360 --> 55:01.440
meaning crisis. So the algorithmic transhumanist thing is

55:01.440 --> 55:03.840
just cotton candy, man, you're not getting nutrition, you're

55:03.840 --> 55:08.240
the whole soul, bad calories. And if the meaning and mental

55:08.240 --> 55:11.080
health crisis and you look out across our adolescents these

55:11.080 --> 55:14.080
days, and that doesn't think that maybe those are not the

55:14.080 --> 55:16.520
healthiest developmental calories we should be chewing, you

55:16.520 --> 55:19.960
know, if that doesn't make your skin get a little bit iffy,

55:20.160 --> 55:26.680
right? Yeah, the data are pretty clear, people. Yeah, calories.

55:26.720 --> 55:30.240
So calories. So the other side, right, there is a better way,

55:30.400 --> 55:32.880
right? There's a better way. There's a there's a thing where

55:32.880 --> 55:38.880
your soul is nurtured. There's this thing where you yourself is

55:38.880 --> 55:42.960
seen and met. That's right. There's a place to get your soul

55:42.960 --> 55:48.640
and spirit in right relation to the real natural relational

55:48.680 --> 55:50.800
technological world we are in.

55:51.160 --> 55:55.400
Yep. So that's the other, you know, there are other people for

55:55.400 --> 55:59.400
whom that those words are the ones. And of course, they're

55:59.400 --> 56:04.640
all part of the same whole. So all the different people and all

56:04.640 --> 56:07.960
the different words so they can all be heard. And again, the

56:07.960 --> 56:10.960
beauty of course, here's then we get this this this integrative

56:11.000 --> 56:15.520
pluralism. Different people can have from their perspective and

56:15.520 --> 56:18.400
their their aesthetics and there's the things that they have

56:18.400 --> 56:22.040
seen in the beautiful aspects of reality that they've discovered

56:22.040 --> 56:24.280
and found that are most precious and bring them forward and

56:24.280 --> 56:29.400
share them for the nurturing and growth and development of each

56:29.400 --> 56:36.000
other, which throws off this gigantic explosion of potential.

56:37.120 --> 56:40.800
Lurking just on the other side of the of the what is it called

56:41.400 --> 56:44.240
the eye of the needle, just on the other side of the needle. If

56:44.240 --> 56:47.800
you just go through it, trick your business, you can have to

56:47.800 --> 56:52.160
leave money behind. I don't mean like your personal money, I

56:52.160 --> 56:53.560
mean, money as a concept.

56:54.520 --> 56:57.600
Yeah, money's context, that little toxic.

56:58.400 --> 57:02.040
At least as the primary as the primary mechanism for mediating

57:02.080 --> 57:05.640
coordination. I don't know if he has no role in the future.

57:05.840 --> 57:09.560
No, right, right, right. But as a central as the central bottom

57:09.560 --> 57:14.720
line. Yeah, exactly. As the bottom line. No. And not even

57:14.720 --> 57:17.480
necessarily part of one of a triple bottom line, but as a as a

57:17.480 --> 57:21.320
piece of a much larger tapestry that we really use in the whole

57:21.320 --> 57:23.560
complex whole as reality.

57:27.280 --> 57:31.120
So you enforce sync up on that, which is really good, like such

57:31.120 --> 57:35.480
a nice thing to have that as a proof, like it's provable. You

57:35.480 --> 57:36.400
do proof on this.

57:36.440 --> 57:40.240
No, it's a it's a I mean, we're I consider us we synced up to

57:40.240 --> 57:44.800
start a real journey of real deep analytic deconstruction and

57:44.800 --> 57:48.200
reconstruction relation. So I'm really looking forward. Yeah,

57:48.200 --> 57:51.200
it's gonna be good. There's one other thing I don't know how

57:51.840 --> 57:55.760
so what do you have? I'm on borrowed time right now, but

57:56.000 --> 57:57.920
everybody's out and about. Let's keep going.

57:58.680 --> 58:01.400
Alright, so here's it here. I want to drop this and see how

58:01.400 --> 58:04.120
this because this came, I wanted to share this with you. They

58:04.160 --> 58:06.520
listened to your last conversation on energy information

58:06.560 --> 58:12.360
and Matthew and with Matthew. Yeah. And I wish I had more

58:12.360 --> 58:15.640
background on him. So some of his proof of work concepts were

58:15.640 --> 58:21.200
not did. I mean, I had to infer quite a bit in relationship

58:21.200 --> 58:25.840
to sense making for the conversation. Yeah. But I

58:25.840 --> 58:28.080
definitely look forward to syncing him up with him. And I

58:28.080 --> 58:30.960
wanted to then share with you some of the stuff that I've been

58:30.960 --> 58:37.160
doing somewhat with John on my own some coin stuff. Okay. So

58:37.160 --> 58:44.560
with the I quite calling and connecting as I heard him talk

58:44.560 --> 58:48.360
about the ribosome and those kinds of issues and the way in

58:48.360 --> 58:51.400
which you're sort of the fundamental basement on energy

58:51.400 --> 58:57.120
necessary for information and then what information is. So I'm

58:57.120 --> 59:02.760
working on out the idea. I was working with john and we and I

59:02.760 --> 59:07.600
was sort of like, I hooked on to this imaginal. Okay, concept

59:07.600 --> 59:11.800
the imagine. Alright, concept of the imaginal john emphasizes

59:11.800 --> 59:14.920
this is a differentiation between imaginary so fully

59:14.920 --> 59:17.960
imaginary stuff that's not imaginal then is in this

59:18.080 --> 59:22.520
intermediate space. Okay, whereby you're representing

59:22.520 --> 59:24.560
something but then in representing it you afford

59:24.560 --> 59:28.560
potential in utilizing it for seeing things you hadn't seen

59:28.560 --> 59:33.920
before. Okay. And that all of a sudden that hit me in a

59:33.920 --> 59:38.880
particular kind of way. All right. All right. whereby I

59:38.880 --> 59:42.200
realized the concept of imaginal creates a beautiful

59:42.280 --> 59:46.480
intermediate space between what we might call the experience of

59:46.480 --> 59:51.200
the real so my say my perception of this can this is a can of

59:51.200 --> 59:53.840
Dr. Pepper. Okay, and we can say, well, that's real at

59:53.840 --> 59:57.200
whatever level of construction. I have a visual image of that.

59:57.320 --> 01:00:02.080
But I see something that's real called Dr. Pepper. Okay. And

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.600
then I can have it in my head. I can have an image of that.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:08.200
Yes, it corresponds to the real. Then I can imagine the Dr.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:12.560
Pepper moving around. Okay. And wonder what it's like to drink

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.480
and the silver potentially an imaginal space. And then I can

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.800
have it sprout wings like a fairy and fly off and call that

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:23.520
imaginary. Okay. Okay. So what does that do that creates a

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.680
kind of a continuum of my immediate experience of the

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.800
real and my virtual, you know, experiential system, like as I'm

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.040
experiencing what's in what the hell is going on inside my head,

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.720
but my subjective conscious experience of being of the real

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:41.600
will call that the imaginal real. Okay, so so imaginal direct

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:46.640
representation, then imaginal would be possible. Okay, space

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.040
and then a full imaginary would then be in the space of the

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:55.960
counterfactual impossible. All right. So now this issue of

01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:01.000
imaginal became a dimension around a intimate way of

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.600
information processing, specifying a dimension of its

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:08.680
relationship to so you have the information processor, and it's

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:12.040
relating to the environment in a particular kind of real way on

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:18.360
a continuum of the imaginary. Okay, whereby the tightest aspects

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:22.520
are where this imaginal real is really in good complex looping

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.200
with whatever out here versus okay, then imaginal and then

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:31.040
imaginary. Yeah. All right. And you notice that I'm doing this

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.960
dimension thing here, I'm creating an a y dimension up

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:38.160
here. Okay, that's then tracking the thing that it's

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.560
tracking. So this is the can out in the world. And then this is

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.960
my experience of it immediately. And then as it go up,

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:48.840
okay, and the imaginary. All right. All right. So here's the

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:55.120
reason that I'm doing this. Okay. This is that I believe that

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.640
there is a deep relationship between what I just specified at

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.800
the level of the imaginal and the real and the relationship

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.720
between real numbers and imaginary numbers. Oh crap. Okay.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.840
Okay, in the way in which mathematics thinks about

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.200
imaginary numbers as being orthogonal to the real numbers.

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:19.240
Okay. And the way in which then when you do an imaginary and

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:25.040
real, you get a complex number plane. Okay. All right. The

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:29.320
trend. So here's what's the here's now a working map. There's

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.640
an imaginal layer of information processing in a subject. Okay,

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.400
that corresponds then that's embedded in the real world. All

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.080
right. There's a dimension upon which there's a mapping of

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:47.320
that of that whereby you engage in in an interactive system that

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.600
you can then talk the complex, transjective interactive, which

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:54.920
is basically as my imaginal system is connecting with the

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:59.120
real, then there will be a complex interface. Okay. All

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:03.800
right. I'm believing that we may have been a way to take the

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:07.800
topology of imaginary and real numbers and complex numbers.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.240
Okay. And basically impute that onto Oh, the shit that happens

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:18.400
inside my head is akin to an imaginal dimension relative to

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:23.440
the real. And then I interface that with in a complex

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.720
transjective plane.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.040
Sorry, ma'am. I do not I do not I cannot follow and I don't

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:37.080
mean in any way to say I disagree. I literally like when you

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.320
heard me say oh shit, like when you interjected the complex

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:46.640
numbers with imaginary numbers. Uh huh. I don't know my my I

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.560
cannot follow down that particular route. I'll try one more

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:53.080
little thing and let's see then we can drop this. Okay. There's

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.720
some stuff here that I'd like to feed back to you. There's

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.840
connects back to my conversation with Matthew and it may it may

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.240
look like there may be certain that happens or maybe that we

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.400
actually have to do this tri adequately. For example. Okay.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.440
All right. So here's the so I was trying to explain this to my

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:09.440
parents. So first you have sort of energy and then you have

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.640
matter. Okay, then you know, I have the life, mind and culture

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.400
that are coming off of matter. Okay. And the tree of knowledge.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.640
Right. Okay. So life, then really what I'm representing with

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.360
life is the complex adaptive plane of information processing

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.800
and communication that give rise to this complex network. Okay.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.360
The semantic content of life then is being thought of as an

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.280
imaginary orthogonal dimension to matter.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.320
Okay. So can I can I say it slightly differently? Please. Can

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:50.360
I say that it is a transcendent? And again, kind of like the

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.720
Landry sense or in the sense of like a Kantian sense even. Sure.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.240
Okay, we're saying more or less the same thing. Yep. Okay,

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:02.480
great. Yep. So to say the language back. And this is actually

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.200
kind of interrupts. Let's do it. Let's do it more like this. Yep.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:22.960
We can do this very easily. I got a real cow. And I got a real

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.840
bucket. And I need to tell you, Hey, would you mind taking that

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:32.920
bucket over that cow and milk the cow? Now we have this really

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:37.160
cool thing where I can replace the actual physical real cow,

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.720
which is heavy and over there with this sound cow, which

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:46.000
resembles it in many ways, not at all. Totally. And yet, enables

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.680
us to coordinate our orientation so that shit can

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:53.880
happen. Now, on paper, you know, this is sort of classic

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.720
semiotics, I have a I'll draw a picture of a cow, which is

01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:00.200
already representation. I've got the word cow. And they are

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:05.320
both pointing to something that is is real. But it is

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.120
transcendent, right? It is neither the physical embodied

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:12.600
actual metabolic cow or the sound cow. And yet, there's a way

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.520
for them to be pointing at the same kind of thing, which you're

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.720
now saying that's the at the imaginary that is or the

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:21.440
imaginal that's in the imaginal plane, the imaginal mode. Yes,

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:27.120
okay. And then we have two, we have three three things, right?

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:30.480
First is that that can happen. That's part of the universe we

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.560
live in is that can happen. The second is that there is an

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:41.040
energetic benefit and energetic cost associated with that move.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:47.400
The cost is the information processor that has the capacity

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:51.720
to do whatever sorts of sort of perception, disambiguation,

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:57.360
pattern recognition work necessary to be able to map to

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:03.680
percept or tons to each other. The energetic savings is a

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:07.000
benefit is what you can do when you don't have to actually

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.280
physically walk over and touch the cow and wave the bucket

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:14.120
around, but can actually just issue the sentence. Yeah. So

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:17.960
there's sort of this trade off brain, right? The the innovation

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:21.560
of brain is the discovery of the potential available when you

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.840
have an organ of information processing potential of a brain

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.640
that can then use systems of justification linguistically to

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.040
coordinate them into a distributed cognition function,

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.640
which enables an unlocking of a tremendous amount of

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.280
information compression in the transcendent or in the

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:39.920
imaginal space, which is what we're doing right now. Alright,

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:44.840
so. Brilliant. Yeah. So, so, right. So now that what the

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.560
Tree of Knowledge saying is that you look at a life and that

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:52.760
life, the semantics of life at the cell level, the RNA DNA

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.920
when he's describing the ribosome, so that information

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:59.360
store that affords the complex dynamics of a cell to make its

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.920
decisions in relation is I life, imaginal life. It's the

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.800
it's the semantics of okay, that they can't be reduced to the

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:11.080
fucking matter because it's this instantiated modeling of

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:15.080
matter and it communicates at this network-binded level. So

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.600
then it affords us that what is the semantic binding that's

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.480
modeling the reality through this information network that

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:23.040
then is doing it based on energy constraints, as they was

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.440
talking about. So it's the information relative to energy

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:29.840
constraint. Yeah. And then that's the cell DNA, RNA

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.120
communication network structure that gives rise to what we

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.680
call the life plane of existence. Then it's mediated by this

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:41.600
kind of imaginal processing. And then you upgrade that. So now

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.680
you get a dimensional of imagination, imaginal around

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.400
neuro cognition through a brain and the animal mindedness of

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:51.520
sensory motor looping. And it's doing an imaginal in

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:55.480
relationship to the biological. So it then drops the imaginal up

01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:59.480
a degree. So that's a secondary imaginal. And then us through a

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:04.120
proposition, we get a third tertiary imagine. Yep. Okay. And

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:07.880
now we can stack the imaginal languages upon each other. And

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.600
the relationship is this orthogonal informational

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.600
relation. Yes. And then sort of kind of use the metaphor you

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.480
used earlier. The thing that Matthew and I were talking

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.800
about is the distinction between the proof of work

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.520
methodology and the fake methodology is the distinction

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:26.520
between the imaginal and the imaginary. Exactly. Yes. Okay.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:32.040
proof of stake has as it's sort of it has a dairy Doridian a

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:41.320
dairy da. Hold on. Just crash the internet again. Back proof

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:44.720
of stake. Yes. The last I heard was proof of stake proof of

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.920
stake is effectively identical isomorphic to many of the

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:53.720
problems we were just discussing in terms of like dairy

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.960
does point around language. If it's entirely self

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.520
referential, if a word means only its relationship to all the

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:05.000
other words in a language, then it's not it's not bound to

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:08.040
reality. It's not bound to nature. It's not bound to

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:15.200
anything other than its own systems of justification. Actually,

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.880
as it turns out, the only the only way you can get there is

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:22.000
actually already when you've lost the plot and have self

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.200
identified the ego, the systems of justification as reality. And

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.480
then you kind of look around go nothing the systems of

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:31.720
justification around here. And then you know that you run off

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.560
on that on that sort of in some sense preordained dead end

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.600
journey. But you're like, no, no, no, there is a way there is

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.960
as you say, Hey, if I if I'm just doing something very simple,

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:45.680
like say, Hey, would you bring me that hammer? And the loop has

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:50.000
a loop that goes from the informational into the energetic,

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:53.600
meaning did you actually did the Greg actually hear what I was

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.280
saying, understand it, walk over grab the object notice hammer

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.160
and bring it to me. If yes, that loop right the loop from the

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:02.880
informational down to the energetic backup is real. And

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.360
that's part of reality. If you're running in just the

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:09.600
algorithm, just the informational, it's unconnected to

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:12.800
reality and is sort of preordained to closure and

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.480
entropic noise in a finite time relatively quickly, by the way.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:21.600
But if I'm looping it, you know, and that's just in complex

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:25.160
space, there's we use the word of complex dynamic space, and

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:28.560
that's life, right? Then I'm just engaging in adaptive life.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.840
And so, so by the way, the hypothesis here, which is, I'm

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.240
gonna say, that's what it feels like it may be a big deal is to

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:44.840
say this thing, proof of work, which I learned as a, like a

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:51.240
pragmatic notion. Oh, it's a way of solving a particular kind of

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:56.280
kind of game theoretic problem, which has resolved a mathematical

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:59.960
question around the Byzantine general's problem. Okay, I

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:05.120
can almost like, but just inside that book, go, Okay, okay, I

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.520
get how it solves that problem. This is a very different

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:11.000
proposition. The proposition here to say no, no, no, this is the

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:17.200
thing that enables the joint point, evoking Greg H, the joint

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:22.960
point of person culture space to actually move to whatever this

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:27.120
next level is. That's the thing that I'm pointing out, which is

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.400
why I had to CC you on this one, right? The purpose is that this

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:34.800
thing, proof of work is the thing that enables computation,

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:39.600
which is information processing, qua information

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.600
processing, because if we're looking now at technology,

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.920
qua technology, not any artifact of technology, we're

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.720
looking at computation, qua computation, information

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.520
processing, information theory, information in and of itself.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:57.040
Proof of work is nothing more or less than the mechanism by

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:03.840
which that is strictly bound to energy. And that if you don't

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:06.480
have energy bound information bound to energy, then

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.520
information flies off into a an entropic closure, which goes to

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:16.160
noise in a finite time. If you do have it bound, then you're

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.200
beginning to actually do something which is happening in

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.360
the real. And you can begin to build on that.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:22.920
Like a complex system.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.760
Yeah. So so I'm now a I'm now a proof of work maximalist.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:35.320
Yeah. Yeah. And what that does is it affords a foundational

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.720
linkage between a foundational concept to foundational

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.920
concepts, okay, of energy and information on the one hand.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:46.960
And now the ease with which you metabolize what I was saying

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:53.160
once I rotated a bit, okay, the the this relationship between

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.520
these dimensions of complexification, this life

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.960
mind and culture ship, okay, to go back to what I was saying,

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:04.120
like we can upgrade the old misunderstandings, the entire

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.160
enlightenment failed to appreciate how to fucking get

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:12.640
from matter in motion into actual, what do we mean by life?

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.480
What do we mean by mind? What do we mean by culture? Because

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:18.040
they were operating on a particular set of assumptions

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:23.640
of what the real had to be. Okay. And now that we can point in

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:27.360
mathematics to the logical relations between structures

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.400
like between real and imaginary numbers and the orthogonal

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.560
mapping between those that actually transposed in the

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.920
relationship between real and information processing. All right.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:42.000
We are afforded to me what I'm wondering about is we're

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:49.000
affording a particular framing that has long eluded our

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:53.240
understanding basically between matter and mind ultimately

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.880
or between energy and a matter and a life and a mind and a

01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:00.720
culture into the forms that we are using to map the substances

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:04.960
and to create a transjective conforming grip between being

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.560
and thinking into a clear metaphysics.

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:15.520
Yeah. Yeah, just as a nice, how does it not even caveat, but

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:20.320
just a nice thing to put out there. My mind does not handle

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.560
certain kinds of math particularly well. And I can tell

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:26.160
you right now that I have I've endeavored mightily to

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:30.000
understand what the fuck are meant by imaginary numbers. I can

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.240
get them down to their formulas. I can use them. I can do

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:36.120
stuff with it. Right. But I kind of got nothing. Like it feels

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:41.800
very weirdly almost panic. Whoa. But you know, barring that

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:46.240
leap right there. The continuity of what you were just

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.360
describing. And we could probably continue to kind of

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:52.120
massage it and hammer on it. I get where you're going. I get

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.960
them. I get the point. Let me see. There's some other things

01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:00.560
that came up. So yes, I think that Oh, okay, there's a couple.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:04.640
One is an acknowledgement, a thing that we should acknowledge

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:09.880
as a culture. You know, we're on the one hand, we're standing

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:13.240
on the shoulders of giants. On the other hand, we're standing

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:16.600
on foundations of sand. beautifully. So right, these are

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:21.760
both true. And the guys were doing their best with very, very

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:26.280
limited frameworks, ability to experiment, coordination

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:31.120
capacity. And there's a lot of path dependent stuff that was

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.680
outweighing the swept into the rug. Like, shit, I don't

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.240
understand how that works. Well, fuck it, I got to figure out

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:38.920
how to do this problem over here. Fine. Simplify, reify. Hope

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:42.040
it doesn't come up until after you know, my job is done, which

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.880
is a pretty human thing. What a human nature. That's a very

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.160
human thing to do. Sounds like a reasonable justification.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:51.480
Exactly. And it's okay. Like it's okay for us to actually

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.760
zoom back and look at something and say, Oh, all right,

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.760
let's, let's take this unexamined for 300 years set of

01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.320
axiomatics. Oh, boy, these are really, really not particularly

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:05.840
functional. All right, fine. So unplug that, let's expand it

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.760
back out. See, geez, look at all this structure that was built

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:11.760
on top of a bunch of actually quite poor axiomatics. How much

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.280
of that can we just throw away? Well, a lot of it. What can we

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:17.120
build new neat stuff? Can we plug a lot of old stuff into it?

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:19.280
Sure. Because most of the old stuff was actually just

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.440
pragmatic, having to do with what really works in a real

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.200
world, right? Or looping it all the way back, by the way, the

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:29.560
technocratic error. Technocratic error is built on top of a lot

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:33.920
of those axiomatic errors in a deep way. And it's not it's a

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:38.360
problem. It's something that it had the loops have not closed to

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:42.400
force the capitulation that it's a problem, but it's a problem.

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:46.000
And we can again, we can argue that ad nauseum, which Matthew

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.400
actually does a quite a good job at in language that doesn't

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:51.920
you know, nobody's going to understand. None of the tech

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.080
none of those who are motivated enough to understand it will

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:58.160
understand it's a bit of a right, right, right. But yes, that

01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:00.120
acknowledgement of saying, Hey, we actually are in a position

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.560
where we can use these things like zoomed dialogues and

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:07.080
integrative pluralism to radically upgrade the robustness of

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.320
the way that we go about thinking about this whole story,

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.200
we're not beholden in an enlightened era, or modernist

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:16.360
era, or late 20th century, like we're not beholden too much, if

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.880
anything really mean the whole point of this integrative

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.560
pluralism frame is like, look, Greg and I met what two years

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:27.640
ago. If that you've got a vast, you know, long lifetime of

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:30.440
thinking about lots of things. Right. And from point of view,

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.800
that's not my native point of view. I've got my own stuff. And

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.960
yet, we've been able to figure out how to achieve generative

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.640
dialogue. Effectively, instantly, this is a key thing

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:41.760
like media. And then it continued the process. So it's

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:48.960
a total one grip, and then it can expand. And it's, it's like

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:52.520
useful from the very get go, and continues to have richness,

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.600
which is nice. Right, you don't have to have this, it sucks for

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.000
two years, and it's useless, then hope it works out and get a

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.880
payload at the end, you can actually have a nice smooth. Okay,

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.280
cool. This is an interesting insight. I walk away from this

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:07.040
with some increased capacity, more meaningful existence in life

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:10.480
and reality, and notice that it just affords more possibility on

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:14.440
the afford basis. Totally on my end as well. And that's the

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:20.720
synergy of it. And man, we tap that. Yeah. And now I am. Yeah,

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:23.320
the borrowed time is definitely no longer. It's been called due.

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:28.720
So, I hear. Good to see you, Ron. Me too. So it's a, hey, man.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.600
Enjoyed it. Yeah, bye bye.
