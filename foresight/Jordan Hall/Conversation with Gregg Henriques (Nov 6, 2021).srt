1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
And I mean, in some sense, this is really just an effort to

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:12,320
rethink. Yeah, you've been a very busy person. And I haven't

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,520
been completely docile for the past period of time. So we may

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,400
have some useful new things. I think so. I think so. There's

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,480
something like there's some fundamental energy information

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,120
syncing up that I think we can do.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,760
I also really enjoyed your stow up. You know, I listened to the

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,680
metacrisis and sovereignty as a the foreseen function. I vaguely

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,920
remember participating in that. I don't have any recollection of

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,480
the content. Anyway, you did a nice job articulating sovereignty,

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,680
metacrisis and ways in which we might cultivate sorrow, use the

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,680
metacrisis as a forcing function, cultivate sovereignty.

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,240
Indeed, or be used by it, perhaps, or be used by it. So I

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,840
appreciated that. And, and you did some stuff on john's

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,840
identity education stuff, which you had a nice conversation with

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,680
him on that. Yeah, and much of my attention over the past, let's

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,680
call it eight weeks has been towards the this broad category,

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,000
roughly now being known as web three. In some sense, also

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,640
being known as the metaverse. Okay. And being firmly Gen X, as

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,520
are you. I know how words and the naming of things tends to

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,960
happen. Yeah. Okay, remember, when there was an information

22
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,160
superhighway, and when there was a series of tubes, and there

23
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,800
was a worldwide web and various things like that, right? So I'm

24
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,400
not, I'm not sort of ensorciled by the notion that somebody like

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,080
Mark Zuckerberg might try to name and claim that metaverse.

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,800
Yep. Nor by the notion that it's very well understood exactly

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,840
what it is that we're referring to when we wave our hands in

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,040
that direction. Totally. Right. And maybe this is maybe so here's

29
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,760
the here's the point here's the conclusion. And it's not going

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,920
to be at all surprising to you. This is just another way of

31
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,560
saying something that we've hit on many times, is that what I

32
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,040
would say is that the notion of the content of the reference

33
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,000
metaverse. And for the moment, I'll actually just collapse web

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,440
three into that. Right. So I'm talking a pointer. And there's a

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,720
bunch of different things that are part of it. Actually, it's a

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,040
question. The fork in the road. So the nature of the meaning of

37
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,440
the notion of the term metaverse is as yet undetermined. It for

38
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:52,160
sure involves the resolution of the relationship between what in

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,600
many places have been called the neosphere or the virtual or

40
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,440
that thing that distinguishes humans from the rest of nature.

41
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,560
Which I call capital C culture and the culture person plane of

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,760
existence. The culture person plane of existence, right. It

43
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,520
involves the resolution of that question of the relationship

44
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,760
between that object and nature. So the relationship between mind

45
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,440
and body to make it very simple. Along one path, the

46
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,960
transhumanist path to kind of give it a name is the path of

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,520
mind establishing dominion. And I mean that quite specifically

48
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,720
over body, over nature. I personally do not like this path.

49
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,160
And then but it's not the only path. The other path is right

50
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:58,280
relationship between mind and body between nature. One might

51
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,560
say governed by or mediated by held by and in some sense

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,680
representing soul. So there's an interesting whole thing going

53
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,760
on here. From an aesthetic perspective, there's certain

54
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,040
warm tones and in this in this language feels more coherently

55
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,880
integrated more more coherently integrated. Yes, more

56
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,040
wholesome. Yes, and more thriving. And one might by the way

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,680
point out for those who are breast tax also more capable of

58
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,400
actually enduring for any meaningful period of time. But

59
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,400
that's like the back half of the 21st century. Right. So it's a

60
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,320
little bit longer story. But and I think that's that's that's

61
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,320
probably a conversation that's worth having more publicly and

62
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,040
more broadly, because I feel right now that we're at a moment

63
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,960
where, well, first, people are a little bit narrow and trying to

64
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,960
understand the nature of this thing metaverse. Like, is it

65
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,360
via goggles sold by Mark Zuckerberg? Categorically, no. But

66
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,280
also, I guess a little bit defeatist of a feeling of an

67
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,640
inevitability of the transhumanist path. No. And while

68
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,920
I'm certainly aware of the, how would I say the transhumanist

69
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,760
path is up by a lot of points at halftime. But it's only half

70
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,840
time. We got work to do. We have some power. A couple of

71
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,160
secret weapons to still pull out. So talk to me about secret

72
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,600
weapons.

73
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,040
Well, there's different kinds of coins and different kinds of

74
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,320
energy information patterns that we might be able to decode.

75
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,120
So as context, because I suspect with hope that we will

76
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,560
actually share this more publicly. Sure. Greg, you have

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,480
been having conversations with a number of other folks. For the

78
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,720
first time, my new new connections are being made

79
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,280
most notably with Anita, Anita Roy, and Forest Landry. And as

80
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,360
this a bit of context, one of the challenges that I, and by the

81
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,400
way, Eric Weinstein have bemoaned over the past decade and

82
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:09,920
a half is the ragtag-ness of the Rebel Alliance. The empire, as

83
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,720
empires do, has been very good at wearing shiny black leather

84
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,960
and destroying worlds with death stars. Rebel Alliance has

85
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,880
been extremely poor at unordinary, like having

86
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,960
conversation, right? So it is quite hopeful for me that these

87
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,000
conversations are now beginning to be had. People are beginning

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,160
to be able to learn how to orient their attention to the right

89
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,320
conversation and the right person, and then have enough

90
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,920
capacity, emotional, semantic, abstract, to be able to actually

91
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,640
have that conversation and connect. And so this is this at

92
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,480
the end of the day is our ultimate secret weapon.

93
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,400
Amen. Amen. So if right, if we can find exactly that context

94
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,480
and shared understanding to afford a participatory network

95
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,320
that enables us to weave a tapestry together, and do so then

96
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,520
to build, take the red pills together and be aware of what

97
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,520
we're doing with organization and clarity, then that's gonna

98
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,120
afford us a second half opportunity to win this game.

99
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,920
Right. That's right. Yeah. And then I would call it

100
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,200
Kool-Aid drinking metaphors notwithstanding.

101
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,200
So yes, I've been having a number of conversations with a lot

102
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,760
of different people lately. I had a conversation with, in

103
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,280
addition, Paul van der Klee just put up on, you know, and so

104
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,360
that was really interesting. And got a chance. I mean, it was a

105
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,640
private conversation with Benita. But I've been meaning to

106
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,600
hook up with her for a while. She did a wonderful presentation

107
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,920
at the stowa on the self, the origins of self, in a particular

108
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,840
way that I thought complemented the stuff that John and Christopher

109
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,360
and I had done in the elusive eye. And I could see a lot of

110
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,640
opportunities for us to, you know, synergistically dance. And

111
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,360
we were able to come together. And I knew that, you know, a lot

112
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,840
of people see my system and rightfully so as some meta

113
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,920
systemic architecture, which is always for many people are more

114
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,720
process oriented and rightfully skeptical of some obsessive

115
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,960
compulsive, you know, quasi autistic, like structure that I

116
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,600
figured out solve everything now is everybody just speaks this

117
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,160
language, we're good, you know, and there's some sub dynamic

118
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,320
there. But actually, that's not really there is that we can

119
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,000
process that aspect, but that is not all that this is. And it

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,960
certainly not all that this affords. So I was able to, I

121
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,960
think we were able to build some bridges and watch a process

122
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,760
dynamic approach, resonate and sync up and show also there's a

123
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,080
lot of architecture about the self and it's various facets in

124
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,880
the models to use the model is that really are very limited,

125
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,040
like genuine disagreement, just different language, different

126
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,920
emphasis. And so that's, to me, that's, Oh, yeah, no, here's

127
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,480
another example of an integrated pluralism that could be framed

128
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,760
as a Oh, no, we can't, but no can get framed as a Oh, wow. No,

129
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,240
these are these are complimentary structures that we can get a

130
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,480
coherent integrated pluralism, where people are realizing that

131
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,080
they're playing a part of the weave, you know, a thread in the

132
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,200
weave. And I had a pretty similar conversation with forest

133
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,280
on the slides, you know, that's, so there's, this is one of

134
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,200
those, how would you call it? The thing is an example of the

135
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,760
thing that it talks about? Yep. And so it should be the case. If

136
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,800
you have one of these, these objects, these, let's just call

137
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,920
them, I don't know, meta theories, just kind of get it

138
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,040
sure, very roughly articulated. This particular kind, right, as

139
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,240
you say, there's a distinction, there's a totalizing kind that

140
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,240
takes itself as a once in forever reification that has

141
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,240
no evolution of all the ability built into it. The ring to

142
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,880
way not. Yeah, exactly. The one name. One. And then this is

143
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,320
other kind, right, the kind, for example, that you're

144
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,960
representing. And the whole point is Benita is and forest is

145
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,680
and right. Right. And what should happen is, from the middle,

146
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,360
like from the middle, when these encounter each other, there

147
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,360
should be a way from their own way of being from their own

148
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,520
nature of noticing the fact that the other is the same kind of

149
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,440
thing, by definition, coming from a different place, and

150
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,520
therefore having a different way of doing what it does. But

151
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,280
intrinsic to each one of these kinds of operators is a capacity

152
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,040
to develop a bespoke protocol for communication and

153
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,720
harmonization, which then generates an instance of

154
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,840
integration and connection that again is never totalizing. It

155
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,560
doesn't collapse anything, it just creates more like a richer,

156
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,080
deeper weave and tapestry.

157
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,080
Exactly. And that, my friend, is a wonderful description of what

158
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,280
we, if we can achieve this thing and make those kinds of

159
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,960
connections, that's going to be central to it, you know, and

160
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,680
this integrated pluralism, this new kind of sensibility, which

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,440
I feel super intimately with John now, in terms of just a, you

162
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,000
know, so a real genuine synergy between two meta theories, you

163
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,560
know, that were completely developed independently of one

164
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,120
another, that now have lock and key, I would at least, you know,

165
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,800
so I don't want to speak for John, but for me, a lock and key

166
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,800
synergy, which I don't know has ever been done before. And, you

167
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,240
know, it'd be interesting to know in sort of the history of

168
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,480
ideas, because the old modernist structures were not systematized

169
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,080
and sort of, you know, graphically oriented in an

170
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,640
integrated pluralistic, it was, Oh, I'm going to build a

171
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,760
justification system, and then you enter into it, and then that

172
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,400
works. And then it then it's just competing between other

173
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,600
systems of justification.

174
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,400
You can sit and have, yeah, okay. I've got I've got mine. You've

175
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,440
got yours. I'm going to throw away 30%. Of mine, you're going to

176
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,760
throw away 40% of yours, we're kind of like glue them together

177
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,760
into a new one. And it's the meta move, right? I'll create a

178
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,680
meta system, which is a synthesis of two lower level

179
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,920
systems. And it's not this integrative pluralism. Maybe at

180
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,600
this point, it's actually worthwhile just spending a

181
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,440
little bit of time in the distinction between those two

182
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,640
notions. Yep, being quite decisive, if you really

183
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,440
can grasp how this, for example, categorically resolves the

184
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,360
sort of old fashioned conflict between individualism and

185
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,240
collectivism, which is just like a modernist, our artifact,

186
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,400
new context. I know that's sort of very helpful, like lots of

187
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,920
people are like, Oh, okay, cool, I can just throw out that whole

188
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,920
conflict, no longer relevant. What's happening in this new

189
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,560
context?

190
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,200
Totally. So for me, in fact, you know, the basic idea of an

191
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,600
integrative pluralism, and by the way, I heard Jim Wreck call

192
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,120
it a coherent pluralism, sometimes I'll add coherent

193
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,320
integrative pluralism together. But basically, there's an

194
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,600
appreciation of a dialectic between some sort of epicenter,

195
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,920
you know, integrating function, and a perspectival pluralistic

196
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,000
diverse shift that affords sort of this dynamic interrelation,

197
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,200
which of course, sort of just makes sense in my system, you're

198
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,320
going to have different entities coming up as specializing

199
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,640
different elements, okay, of some sort of potentially shared

200
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,680
ground. All right. And then what was before was sort of like

201
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,040
an argument that you're going to build a system of justification

202
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,920
that maps the territory, and then kind of is a pristine

203
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,040
modernist notion. Okay, if we think about this, oh, we're

204
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,760
gonna, it has to be reasoned in this based on accuracy, and

205
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,440
this based on analysis, and it's going to have truth value or

206
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,640
not, and it's going to be in competition with others, and then

207
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,640
they'll battle and maybe break up. But really, I just see them

208
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,880
basically sitting there as independent paradigms, okay, as

209
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,840
they're making truth claims. You then they get the post modern

210
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,040
structure coming along and critiquing, which basically says,

211
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,920
Oh, all of that is imminent contextual justification, meaning

212
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,040
you guys are saying you're developing your pure systems,

213
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,440
right? But really, you're it's your, you know, we think Nietzsche

214
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,280
is the first postmodern, you know, it's your it's the

215
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,320
psychology, the philosophers 90% of the goddamn system. Okay,

216
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,120
it's all just a justification of whatever dynamics they're

217
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,480
dealing with, they say it's some pristine metaphysics, but

218
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,560
it's basically their perspective in the world, right? And then we

219
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,000
can extrapolate that to the to a crass postmodern view is like

220
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,640
it's all fucking justification, it's all just a, you know, imminent

221
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,400
context of power and justification. And there's no

222
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,760
ground upon which you would then, you know, afford any

223
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,040
legitimizing function, which then of course, in its extreme,

224
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,200
says, Well, there's no, there's no claims to be made at all,

225
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,480
and all relatively equal, etc. And then of course, that's kind

226
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,920
of absurd. Right. And so the integrative plural meta modern

227
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,640
integrative pluralistic sensibility is, Hey, we all are

228
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,120
aspecializing different, you know, pieces of the elephant in a

229
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,400
particular kind of way, right? The, you know, the blind men in

230
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,200
the elephant metaphor, we're going to aspecialize, we're

231
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,240
going to see various elements. And then we were going to weave

232
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,440
together and see how these synergistically, pluralistic

233
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,160
perspectives may afford a coherent, integrated

234
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,720
understanding, and appreciate the diversity while also having a

235
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,000
shared context of richness and growth. And that, that

236
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,320
sensibility seems to me to be far superior in a synthetic

237
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,400
synthesis, hegelian sort of way from modernity, and its

238
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,160
justification, rationality, and postmodernity is at all

239
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,840
justification, context BS, to an integrated pluralism that then

240
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,920
affords a collective intelligence sense making,

241
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,800
especially if we add the zoomed eologos to it. So zoomed eologos,

242
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,280
unlike the old where you had to just write shit, right? Like

243
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,480
as I'm a someone academic,

244
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,320
like this thing right here, like this right here zoomed eologos

245
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,960
is like, so I can now call Benita. So in the old days, if we

246
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,560
were both academics, I'd publish something and then she

247
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,320
would publish a critique of my metasystemic structure, because

248
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,560
it's the wrong direction to go. Right? And then I'm like, Oh,

249
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,960
God, you know, now I have to gain a that thing, and undermine

250
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,760
that and justify why my justification system in writing

251
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,960
in a context of competition of, you know, Swords of academia,

252
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,080
right? And now it's like, Oh, call somebody and be like,

253
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,640
actually, that's true in some ways, but that's not my full

254
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,080
emphasis. And I love the fact that you're going that way. And

255
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,880
actually, Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Because actually, I think this

256
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,800
is good. And this is really complimentary. Oh, so a face to

257
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,080
face de logos that affords the capacity to, you know, have an

258
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,880
oral indigenous relationship, feedback on each other, make

259
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,480
corrections immediately in real time, it's totally different

260
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,520
than the old game of refined publication, so that you get a

261
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,280
defense of a particular persistent in writing, where

262
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,760
you're basically, there's no iterative, immediate feedback

263
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,800
process, which is a dialogue is so unbelievably good at. So it's

264
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,000
a real, this de logos thing from an academic perspective, and

265
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,120
affording this capacity to build rich relations and an

266
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,800
integrative pluralistic understanding. It's a, it's a

267
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,240
the now we can build on some of the digital metaverse shed as a

268
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,720
game as a as a medium potential game changer, if we can turn it

269
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,040
into a strength. And I think, right, one of the things that

270
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,240
afford them. So as an exercise, hold on one second.

271
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,200
There we go. Okay, as an exercise in tough effort and

272
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,320
virtuality. I will act, this is the old internet ping, I will

273
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,480
act or I will take the what you just provided, I will metabolize

274
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,320
it and I will not bomb it, but articulate express back out

275
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,880
something. But the point, the meta point is then to say, Okay,

276
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,520
cool, we're doing is we're orienting in a trans to use for

277
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,000
specific language, transcendent location, by means of the real

278
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,800
relationality of this zoom de logos environment, and the sort

279
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,640
of pointer complex, right of the semantic terms that we happen

280
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,640
to be using in broadly speaking share. So couple points like

281
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,680
one point is the role of media. And you mentioned that in the

282
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,200
old days, we might even say modernity is a consequence of

283
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,960
books, the consequence of print, both as an opportunity and a

284
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,600
constraint, right, you could now communicate with a much larger

285
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,280
group of people over a longer period of time than just the

286
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,400
local individuals you could interact with in conversation.

287
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,240
But you couldn't have the context relevance, right, the

288
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,040
relational possibilities, both at the EQ level, as well as in

289
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,560
terms of just the semantic requirements of what what context

290
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,760
provides, right? So you were this new milieu of that sort of

291
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,200
behavior, that sort of justification system that was

292
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:39,000
selected for effectiveness in the context of book became a kind

293
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,440
of artifact that began to generate and attract human

294
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,240
attention and energy, and to coordinate more and more choices

295
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,520
and behaviors to the degree to which we're beginning to explore

296
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,360
the potentials that that afforded, which of course, we're

297
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,840
many, right? For example, much of the scientific enterprise is no

298
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,040
more or less than the fact that you can begin to collaborate with

299
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,240
people that you don't know by means of appropriately structured

300
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,160
text. And concepts like peer review, much maligned in some

301
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,800
quarters, which appropriately, are basically just a simple

302
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,600
technology to say, Okay, well, how do we deal with the

303
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,120
problems and the possibilities of decontextualized, relatively

304
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,760
broadcast, you know, tight semantic articulations. Okay,

305
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,400
cool. That's one, two.

306
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:43,200
The this notion of the in the larger context, many of the

307
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,600
things are happening. We have people are having kids, people

308
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,040
are making money. More specifically, there's this

309
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,080
wave that's been going on. And by the way, now I'm back back at

310
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,040
like Gutenberg, roughly speaking. So that's okay. Okay.

311
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,480
People were people were fighting fights, people were

312
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,160
conquering, that's the better word for conquering and defending

313
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,280
territory. It was that was already happening. That was a

314
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,240
whole wave. It was kind of its own sort of movement to it. And

315
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,080
books enters into this field. And it changes the terms of that

316
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,800
field, and does not sort of cause it or cause it to disappear.

317
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:30,400
But the form of the kingdom that is appropriate and possible in a

318
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,760
pre literate environment is not the form of a kingdom that is

319
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,560
possible and appropriate in a post literate environment, and

320
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,920
the ability to send dispatches that can communicate to further

321
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,200
governors, right? The British Empire was was produced as the

322
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,800
consequence of the ability to actually figure out how could you

323
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,480
effectively coordinate and deploy force and power economically,

324
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,640
diplomatically and kinetically, by means of the written word.

325
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,200
That's what it is. There's an organ for doing that kind of

326
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,280
thing. So we say, you know, we're in the process of a

327
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,000
technological disruption, at least as significant as the

328
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,880
book, obviously, I would say much more so. One affordance of

329
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,200
which is this notion of real time, highly contextual, high

330
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,960
relational conversation, zoom theologous. I like, by the way,

331
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,760
the implication of zoom is a as an adjective as well as a now.

332
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,560
Restrains is the state of the game. And we don't we don't

333
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,240
have to engage in the kinds of things that happen in the in

334
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,320
the decontextualized written word form, we can engage can and

335
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,680
should and will inevitably will engage in a different

336
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,720
style of interaction. Right. And it gives rise to a completely

337
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,040
different form of coordination, which is now well understood in

338
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,600
the in the thing named Web three, they don't yet I don't

339
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,920
think understand why, like what they're actually in service to,

340
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,680
or what is the real potential? What is the what are the design

341
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,040
characteristics of what the potential looks like on its

342
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,600
interior as it develops? But they're aware of the fact that

343
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,080
they are actually dealing with a new level of coordination and

344
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:11,080
that portends much back to Rebel Alliance and stealing a wind

345
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,920
here in the winning seconds. Right. Okay, hold on. Ah, and so

346
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:25,600
and much of the criticism of postmodernism is the correct is

347
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,560
accurate. There is a

348
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,960
intrinsic. It's fun. I'll just use the language from post

349
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,920
modern intrinsic totalizing characteristic that is associated

350
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:44,320
with the model or the approach of book, right of written of

351
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,560
written word, which is it's sort of because the rate of

352
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,040
communication, the contact, the contact decontextualization of

353
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:59,200
it. There's a need actually to form a paradigm, right. The

354
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,960
paradigm is an artifact of this point in time, I would say.

355
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:08,400
Hmm. Yeah, I'm gonna propose that as that's a yes. This is

356
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,360
actually by the way, I had this title a long time ago, but I

357
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,280
sort of embedded Kuhn inside Foucault. And so Foucault's

358
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,800
concept of the episteme is more fundamental than Kuhn's concept

359
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,480
of the paradigm. That the paradigm is a form appropriate to

360
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,720
the episteme of the moment of that. Nice. I could totally see

361
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,320
that. Yep. And it has to do with things like the the

362
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,720
translation cost of different kinds of language. If I'm

363
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,040
building a new same doing just like chemistry. And I've got

364
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,760
terms in chemistry that other people people don't know. And

365
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,120
it's costly to learn a new term. It's not not trivial. I'm very

366
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,320
confusing if you don't know what the terms mean. Right. And so

367
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,440
that's people trying to learn this thing. Yeah, exactly. To

368
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,840
the point, let's hold that actually as a good model. So the

369
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,520
old fashioned way of doing it is you create a dictionary. I

370
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,680
need to okay, well, here's the official fucking meaning of the

371
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,640
terms. If you need to know what they mean, go here. We've

372
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,720
created a formal totalizing centralized construct that has

373
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,840
hierarchical domination over the meanings of these words. If you

374
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,960
disagree, fuck you, you're out of the team, you're not on the on

375
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,440
the on the board. And here's what it looks like. But if we all

376
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,920
agree to this sort of finite construct, then we can coordinate

377
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,040
using these hyper decontextualized written

378
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,600
constructs. If you haven't got any context, you can't be like,

379
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
wait a minute, hold on. What do you mean by that? That sounds

380
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,040
sound weird to me. If you can't do that at all, then you

381
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,320
literally either you just don't communicate, or you have to have

382
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,040
some kind of totalizing construct that defines what is valid

383
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,400
discourse within a particular paradigmatic frame, right?

384
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,720
Just the consequence, there's no sort of here nor there. That's

385
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,880
just what happens. And similarly, that same thing works

386
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,720
to the level of political power. If I want to be able to

387
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,440
effectively coordinate economic, financial, kinetic, diplomatic

388
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,920
energy across some spatial location, I have to have a

389
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,000
defined after control the definitions of the meanings of

390
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,240
the words within that particular communications, a milieu.

391
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,240
Otherwise, you know, I'm saying you sell the guy on the other

392
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,520
side, it's like, Oh, that means buy, doesn't work, right? You

393
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,680
have to have agreement. What do we mean? We all have to have a

394
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,200
shared dictionary of what terms mean within some level of

395
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,360
rigor, right? And that of course, requires that each sort of

396
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,680
sphere of influence, which largely, of course, became

397
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,320
linguistic. You know, the notion of a nation is being

398
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,040
effectively the playing out of a particular linguistic, and

399
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,840
therefore, ethno cultural, but linguistic constraint. And

400
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,640
remember, the French formally, now have a formal institute that

401
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,760
is nothing but precisely defined every single word. They

402
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,280
kind of got the essence of it pretty precisely. That's just

403
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,560
how it works out. And so then, of course, as you say, we end up

404
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,600
kind of in this wrestling match of no, no, no, my definitions are

405
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,880
more right than your definitions, or our right and your

406
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,920
definitions are wrong. And therefore, you have to play on

407
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,720
my turf, because I don't want to be playing in your turf. And,

408
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,600
you know, the strict kind of subordinate construct, which

409
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,120
makes people a little bit, which gives right, like, individual

410
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,320
versus collectivist. And a collectivist relationship is

411
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,120
precisely the subordination of my experiences, my meaning, my

412
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,880
understanding to some kind of formal construct that is

413
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,240
necessary for shared communication. Hold on. So I can

414
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,600
make this less choppy.

415
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,200
The right network, the right network. Alright, well, you can do

416
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,600
it. Okay, so

417
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,240
so then we end up with the new thing, this new milieu, new

418
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,960
possibilities. It sits on top of the old. So one thing is that

419
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,040
we're part of the part of the essence of the new is that the

420
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,920
old happened, we're aware of it. It's not going to benefit from

421
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,960
okay, God, I understand all that that was part of how things

422
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,160
happen. I kind of learn those lessons as humans tend to the

423
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,600
hard way. Okay. And we're sitting in a very different

424
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:25,160
potential. If I have not only, you know, the tension, not only

425
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,840
can I call you and disambiguate and have relational context, but

426
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:36,080
also, I have to because the power, the possibility of some sort

427
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,360
of formal, man, this is a pain. What's happening? Why is that

428
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,240
happening? I'm seeing you like, oh, on and off, just like

429
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,120
completely red. Are you having the same thing on my end?

430
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,400
But I'm having a bit of your, yeah, you're, I mean, I'm

431
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,360
definitely tracking you, but it's, we got it, we have some

432
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,040
interference.

433
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,680
I don't know. On my end, everything seems very strong.

434
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
Shift to a different network.

435
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:24,000
Okay, let's see if that makes a difference. So far, nope, not at

436
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,640
all. It may be on your end. So let's see.

437
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,560
Right. So not only can I now engage in a zoom to your logos

438
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,320
when there's a moment of ambiguity, but also in fact,

439
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,560
have to because everybody's involved in the conversation.

440
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:47,960
We

441
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,440
I'm gonna terminate the call and start it.

442
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,680
Perfect. Do you want, do you want to send me a zoom link on

443
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
send you send me a zoom link? Okay.

444
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,960
Yeah, to the point, every, every new thing has its own

445
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,640
pluses in mind.

446
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,320
Well, there's many, right? If you take a look at how Twitter

447
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,840
operates. So what are the, what my, the point I was making

448
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,160
earlier is that we now, of course, this is the story of the

449
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:26,040
building up the internet. We have this. Oh, come on.

450
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,240
Are you still there?

451
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,640
Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.

452
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,360
Okay. My computer. There we go. Okay.

453
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,120
What do they call it back like back in the late 90s and early

454
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,120
2000s, like, you know, everybody has a printing press, that

455
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,560
kind of a thing. Free channels on TV 2000 channels to now

456
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,200
everybody at that point. The idea that in Twitter, everybody

457
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,280
is somewhat symmetric in their capacity to participate in the

458
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,920
conversation. They're not, no, actually, because number of

459
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,800
followers and algorithmic, throttling and things like

460
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,680
that. But it's a different environment, which means the

461
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,200
the tech, this is back to one of my feces, right? The notion

462
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,800
the, the technology, the institutional framework of the

463
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:15,320
Blue Church, which evolved to regulate the mechanics of

464
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,040
coordination and paradigmatic formation in the context of mass

465
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,280
media communication, right? Breaks down has broken down and is

466
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,560
accelerating in this breakdown. Because it wasn't evolved for

467
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,000
this particular environment, this needs to be so we're in the

468
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,600
process, successfully or not, of course, you can always fail to

469
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,920
adapt to your niche of evolving a new form of how we do this

470
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,760
sort of thing in this in this new potential in this new

471
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,920
environment. And to loop all the way back, this new environment

472
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,440
is one that you're calling sometimes coherent, integrative

473
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,560
pluralism. And it has characteristics of neither

474
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:02,840
needing or requiring a subordination on the part of

475
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,840
members of the dialogue. I'm not playing your game, you're not

476
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,880
playing my game, we are afforded the possibility and the

477
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,840
potential of producing a novel game bespoke, right? Every

478
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,360
relationship is its own play, which has as a consequence, the

479
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,640
enriching of both of our games intrinsically, totally, which is

480
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,440
why we continue to play. And I would say meta enriching, because

481
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,000
it's that underlying piece is so powerful, and also synergistic

482
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,720
value, or we call it the anti rivalrous consequence that as you

483
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,360
and I, for example, play in this way, and thereby enrich our own

484
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,400
capacities, it produces a higher degree of potential in every

485
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,640
other possible game we might play. Totally. So by talking with

486
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,520
Greg, I actually becoming more valuable player in the larger

487
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,560
game for literally everybody else. And if you sort of just

488
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,040
multiply that out, that gets from a process perspective, the

489
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,360
shape of that curve is very steep. It's absurdly steep,

490
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,800
actually. This begs the question of the singularity, we'll

491
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,640
ignore that for the moment.

492
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,560
So let's see. So, so I'll just so just to riff off that a little

493
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,480
bit. If I put it a little bit in Utah language, where most the

494
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,600
old relationship, the systems of justification that we operate

495
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,000
under, and our subordinate to. And now, and then so you get

496
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,080
modernity, you get the basically the tribe, and then the

497
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,360
civilization, and then it's, it's dictating into traditional

498
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,280
civilization. And then we get into refined knowledge, and we

499
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,720
get science, but modernity is still basically creating systems

500
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,240
of justification that you're subordinate to at various levels.

501
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,680
Yeah. Postmodern sort of comes along and says, Well, it's all

502
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,720
power, but it's still basically then like a battle of

503
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,200
justification in a particular way. We are actually now at a

504
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,720
place to, we're not going to like teleport out of justification,

505
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,480
but we can get adjacent to justification in a different kind

506
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,160
of way. Again, we can relate to these systems of justification

507
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,240
through, Oh, here you are as specializing in a particular

508
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,040
part of the whole, you know, through your narrative and

509
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,160
propositional structure, and I can relate to you where you are in

510
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,560
that, and then I share where I am in that. And now rather than

511
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,360
trying to then think about, Okay, there are no point of

512
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,200
justification, or we're going to subordinate ourselves, we're

513
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,160
going to be like, Oh, we're an integrated pluralistic system

514
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,360
of justification that we can be adjacent to participate in, but

515
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,800
not necessarily force some sort of

516
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,000
Yeah. And there's a sort of your definition of ego, what the ego

517
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,480
is, right? We have a bit of a historical ambiguity, you know,

518
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,800
Freud uses it differently than the Buddhists do. So we're going

519
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,680
to use the, the Greg and Rick has version of it, which I quite

520
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:53,280
like, which is the kind of the human neurocognitive faculty for

521
00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:00,080
producing systems of justification. Exactly. Great. And the sort

522
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,440
of the classic problem is the one where you yourself subordinate

523
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,520
yourself to your own ego, right? The ego self inversion. Yep.

524
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,280
And the social version of that is the same kind of thing, right?

525
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,560
So if Jordan's ego is interacting with Greg's ego, and

526
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,320
Jordan's ego is subordinating Jordan's self and Greg's ego

527
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,320
is subordinating Greg's self, boom, we're locked into this

528
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,040
entire set of cascade effects that produce these sort of

529
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,960
dominant structures. This is by the way, a very clean way of

530
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,040
describing the transformation into game A, from my

531
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,680
perspective. Totally. Okay. So what we're noticing is that we

532
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,640
can notice that there's an individual version of this

533
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,080
form of just proper relationship. Oh, systems of

534
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,040
justification are a thing. Nice. But that's the whole thing.

535
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,320
Right there. They're a map. They're not the territory. And

536
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,760
there is a territory. How do I know? Well, the ego is a thing.

537
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,160
It's not the whole thing. There's a self. How do I know? Because

538
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,840
I do. You know, I can just, here I am, there's a self I can

539
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,080
begin to get very, very clean distinction of distinctions

540
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,040
between them by a variety of practices. In my case, it happened

541
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,440
to be meditation. And, and, okay, well, that affords us a

542
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,280
whole new possibility. We no longer have to imagine that this

543
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,080
game is just a kind of a winner takes all slugfest of power,

544
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:24,680
manipulation, and justification. But actually, there's, there's a

545
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,720
ground, there's a self, systems of justification or a tool for

546
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,560
coordination between things that are outside of the scope of

547
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,120
the systems of justification, like say, that's true, and humans.

548
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,720
Really? This back, by the way, to the fork transhumanism in this

549
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,120
other thing. Yes, right. And I would then say, what modernity

550
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,120
did, and then capital labor relations created a system of

551
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,600
justification, skits into the conversation outside of the

552
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,400
forest, systems of justification that then are

553
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,040
instrumental result in a power law distribution of influence in

554
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,840
a particular kind of way. And that fundamentally miscalibrates

555
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,080
the actual heart, which actually should be ideally

556
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,040
calibrated on relational value rather than social influence.

557
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,600
And one of our tasks in this transformation is to recalibrate

558
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,520
a power law distribution of influence into a more Gaussian

559
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,920
distribution of relational value, and connection in that

560
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,000
regard. So in terms of the kinds of moves that we want to be

561
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,440
making, relative to modernity, we want to get adjacent to our

562
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,920
justification, see the monsters that we created and all the

563
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,720
power that they did, diagnose them in a particular way, and

564
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,960
then rotate, you know, that if we're able to weave this

565
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,560
together, this will afford us the capacity to win this game.

566
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,160
Yep. Okay, so I want to double click on that. It's a

567
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,120
profoundly powerful construct in insight. Again, one of these

568
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,200
things that enables us to be liberated from things that in

569
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:57,000
many ways can be depressing constraints. So what you just

570
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,560
said is something like this. Pareto distributions are yes,

571
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:09,160
they happen. But they're an artifact of a particular form of

572
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,560
social relationship. So if you have a social relationship that

573
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,480
operates in a certain way, which I just call it, call it

574
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,800
society, society, we can sort of describe that in more detail,

575
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,720
if you have a society, then you're going to have Pareto

576
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:32,720
distributions of social relationships, kind of done. But

577
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,720
that's not the only kind of relationality. In fact, it's

578
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,680
even not even the more fundamental, but the more basic,

579
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,520
more fundamental kind of relationality, which I just

580
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:45,600
call community, just to make a distinction, doesn't have a

581
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,560
Pareto distribution as its equilibrium, right, as a Gaussian

582
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:55,000
distribution as its equilibrium. If you can land on that, like

583
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,680
if you're a person who spends time in places like economics or

584
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,680
in politics, you care about justice, this fact, this

585
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,720
distinction is super profound. It describes the fact that

586
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,840
there is there's a way to achieve a kind of quality of

587
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:19,880
relationship that we would define as, say, justice or fairness

588
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:26,160
or equity. There's an actual way to get there, right? You

589
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,320
can't get there staying inside the form of society. If you

590
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,040
stay inside the form of society, you're never going to get

591
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,760
there. It's not a thing. You have to go down and over into this

592
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,640
other form. But once you get to this other form, not only is it

593
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,000
possible, it's actually equilibrium state. And that's

594
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,160
there. That's the power of this approach of being able to say,

595
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,680
okay, I agree. We don't like this particular structure, this way

596
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:56,760
this structure plays out. But how is this like, what is it? Say

597
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,400
hello to the new boss, same as the old boss. If you think that

598
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,400
just by killing the king and installing yourself as king,

599
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,600
you're changing the nature, you're not. But there is a

600
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,360
different place. And it's not imaginary, right? It's not the

601
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:13,040
kind of the communist mid century, you know, failure of oh, not

602
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,480
getting the thing and there's a place. So let's just talk about

603
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,440
like, why is there a Pareto distribution in this thing I'm

604
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,320
calling society? What do I when I say society, what is it? I'm

605
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,400
really talking about what do I mean?

606
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,480
Yeah.

607
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,360
First off, the lovely yeah, I mean, the short answer. One short

608
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,840
answer is money and influence beget money and influence. Okay.

609
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,160
So as you have more opportunity to gain control, and there are

610
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,480
lots of different that this Pareto distribution basically is

611
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,240
that a small number of individuals acquire an enormous

612
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,480
disproportionality of influence and control, okay, and a power

613
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,200
kind of law distribution. So for folks that don't know what

614
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,440
that is, that's that's the essence of it. And then it

615
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,640
creates a massive inequality. And we have seen that in our

616
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,760
society. And virtually any context in any societal

617
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,080
organization tends to drift into these Pareto distributions,

618
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,600
they're very difficult to prevent there's a and there are

619
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,480
reasons why that we don't we can dialogue about but I don't know

620
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,040
that that's crucial. For me, the issue is that when you get this

621
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,720
that's going to create all sorts of problems. Okay, the focus is

622
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,440
on influence of our modernity, we create capital labor, what

623
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,200
we're basically trying to do is actually observable work

624
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,800
effort, and our science orient us in this perspective, which I

625
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,160
think is a deep mistake. One of the things that are enlightenment

626
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,040
is that we don't get human nature right here. And we can talk

627
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,720
about what the distinction is my own history of social influence,

628
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,200
relational value, etc. But it's the felt sense of being known in

629
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,200
value, it is our core, that's crucial, we certainly track

630
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,280
social influence. But that's another aspect. And we miss this

631
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,040
psychology misses this, the humanists sort of get it. But

632
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:54,080
anyway, the point what you made, we can actually see in the

633
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,960
world, I want to be people, all you need to do is you go back to

634
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,040
hunter gather oral indigenous structures, the vast majority of

635
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,120
oral indigenous structures are about building community. Okay,

636
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,840
and guess what, narcissistic ego shit is regulated deeply in

637
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,600
that structure, they do not want people pulling out what's

638
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,480
called the blue line on the in on the influence makes I'm

639
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,240
superior, and I'm going to egoically control your ass

640
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,800
through power. They regulate that virtually every community

641
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,160
society figures out structures to regulate it. Okay, so then what

642
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:31,480
happens is we basically release that thing in game a world, we

643
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,320
release that thing. The society and the Pareto distribution and

644
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,000
nature, power and influence afford a capacity, even our

645
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,680
justifications release that thing. So what we're saying is

646
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,720
that they Oh, my God, if we then invest in that societal

647
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,480
structure, in particular, well, that's what you get, you get

648
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,000
game. And you can't just kill that you actually need to what is

649
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,680
the kind of structure that's actually sustainable. Actually,

650
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,880
if we look at this, and we actually create a particular

651
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,080
type of oral indigenous DLO goes kind of dynamic that is a

652
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:03,520
fundamentally different dynamic with this ego as power issue.

653
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,760
Well, then maybe we have something serious going on here.

654
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,040
Yeah, so what I would say, and I think you're going to agree

655
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,320
with me on this is that the we've actually produced a lot of

656
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,080
good language to describe the thing that I'm calling society,

657
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,640
or precisely specifically the thing that more fundamental and

658
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:27,080
calling game a, which has to do with the, the prioritization,

659
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,640
almost obligate mediation of relationality by means of ego.

660
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,640
That's a very clean way of articulating it. Now, what's

661
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,640
happening there? Well, what's happening there is the ego at

662
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,040
the end of the day is a finite state machine. If you if you

663
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,320
understand that from a computational perspective, things

664
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,720
lit up. Yeah, you think about money, right? Money is a finite

665
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,200
state machine. It's very, you know, has a large amount of

666
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,880
processing power. That's why it's functional. It's what what

667
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,560
markets do, right markets are a massively parallel information

668
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:07,080
processing machine. But it's a finite state machine. And ego

669
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,960
works very functionally inside money, my ego connect quite

670
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,960
nicely. There's a reason why they're very wide narcissistic

671
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,280
ego ego personalities perform very well. And they tend to rise

672
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,920
to the top of the predator distribution, the 80 20 rule is

673
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:27,040
a common vernacular for that. When when one mediates complexity,

674
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:32,200
when one mediates rich, highly contextualized relationships by

675
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,560
means of the complicated by means of finite state machines,

676
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,280
even very large ones, one is operating in the form that I am

677
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,760
calling society, and therefore has by implication, for sure,

678
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,640
guaranteed things like predator distributions. Yep. And for

679
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,560
sure, guaranteed things like a infinite cascade effect in

680
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,400
paradigmatic interrelational communication. Because you now

681
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,240
have to find some way of doing some translation between your

682
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,760
finite state machine and my finite state machine, which means

683
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,800
that if I have a small deviation in the way that my state

684
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,920
machine maps particular context from yours, we actually can't

685
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,960
engage in any real communication, either I have to learn yours,

686
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,640
which is what education has become education machine for

687
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:21,520
stamping shared models on mines, which has an ancillary benefit,

688
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,000
training cells to become egos, socialize them into the system.

689
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,200
And of course, training egos to become narcissists, right? Of

690
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,960
course, right. So it's not if you understand how these system

691
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,400
dynamics work, it's not confusing how we got where we are. And

692
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,400
frankly, where we are, where we are is like, Oh, yeah, I know

693
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,080
where we are. And I know how we got here. And how we get out of

694
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,520
it becomes, Oh, okay, to get out of it, as you say, we need to

695
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,560
say human nature isn't the kind of thing that was written about

696
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,520
in the Enlightenment, neither Rousseau nor Voltaire nor any

697
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,360
of those guys were frankly close. We've got some pretty good

698
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,680
ideas. More importantly, we've got good models. As you say, the

699
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,960
oral indigenous cultures tell us what it looks like. And there

700
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,520
it is, those are humans operating according to human nature,

701
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,840
more or less. We can do a diff across a very large number and

702
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:15,000
get a nice, you know, basic model. And now double clicking on my

703
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,560
fork in the metaverse. And we're entering into a new milieu. We

704
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,320
are in fact, both literate. We're not an oral culture, we're

705
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,640
literate culture, decreasingly, and maybe that's the best. But

706
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,200
we're also a zoom, theologous, zoom, theologous culture, almost

707
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,880
certainly. I don't think that there's a path where we drop

708
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:43,920
back down into a pre electrical civilization. Well, I mean,

709
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,680
I don't like that.

710
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,840
And land, there's a lot of paths where we do that, but we don't

711
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:56,960
like it. Just keep going. Way, way past oral indigenous. But

712
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:03,560
there is a path where we find this new higher tone of human

713
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,760
nature, establishing right relationship with this thing, the

714
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,720
virtual, the virtual per se. And this is the key. This is the

715
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,880
point of the metaverse, the metaverse is where we actually

716
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,560
look at the notion of technology in the eye directly.

717
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,440
Exactly. We're not we're not looking at like a pair of eyeglasses.

718
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,560
Right. We're not looking at a pen. Right. We're not even looking

719
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,880
at a cell phone. Right. We're actually looking at the essence

720
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:37,080
of technology directly. And asking, what's the relationship

721
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,800
here? Because if you want to play the narcissist ego finite

722
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:47,080
state machine game, AI wins. Yeah, better playing that than any

723
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,360
human mind will ever be. And you know, Elon Musk's, Elon

724
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,280
Musk's gambit is, well, let's just become AI, like the only

725
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,880
thing in time for us to just do that. Which if if you don't have

726
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,160
the rest of this theory, it's going to make sense. That's,

727
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,000
that's what you'll get to. Our proposition is that no, there's

728
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,360
actually a whole other kind of game that we can play. I want

729
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,120
that it's not a relationship where we are operating and

730
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,800
coordinating by means of ego, by means of systems of

731
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,480
justification, where where systems of justification being a

732
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,040
thing, where we're ego being a thing, but we're actually held

733
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,680
in a much larger, richer, fully contextualized world called

734
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,640
reality. And in reality, we can actually reposition

735
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,520
technology in its proper location.

736
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,520
Beautiful said.

737
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,240
Easiest said to done.

738
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,480
By winning win the game as a function of it, but it was

739
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,640
brilliantly articulated.

740
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,880
Right, right. This is the halftime, right? This coach

741
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,280
would have to say, all right, all right, this is the

742
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,160
halftime for me.

743
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,200
Now there's there's a play that another game actually played

744
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,880
out, but that's like that. That's how it was up, right? You

745
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,200
got a team algorithm, right? Team, what do I call it one time

746
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,760
called team godless communists, just to kind of use a nice

747
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,200
entry Americana, which is just algorithm, just another way of

748
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,640
saying the same thing, right? Team ego, team narcissists, team

749
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:17,200
finite state machine, team society, team systems of

750
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,160
domination, team can't get outside of your own system of

751
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,200
justification and bullshit yourself into meaningless, right?

752
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,960
It's all that team, right? We're on that side. Yep. And then

753
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:34,760
team, human team, soul, team, self, team, context, team

754
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:39,000
complexity, team, nature and technology in wholesome

755
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,480
relationship, right? They're there in line. Totally. That's

756
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,280
the fork. That's the fork of the metaverse, as I'm calling it.

757
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,560
That's right. Calling it right now. That's the fork in the

758
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,160
metaverse.

759
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:56,240
And bing, bing, bing, as we said, the potency, the expansion

760
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,800
of the field of possibility that emerges in this new kind of

761
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,960
zoomed eologos, new form of generative, integrative

762
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,800
pluralism is our secret weapon.

763
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,560
And it's, yep, qualitatively vaster. It's a different order of

764
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:21,880
infinity and is possible in principle in the algorithmic

765
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,240
domain.

766
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:31,280
Actually, yeah, so let me, let me, let me take a slight right

767
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,920
turn and come back to this. Okay, because you said secret

768
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,120
weapon, and I totally agree, but I want to add something, some

769
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:44,440
things to that weapon. Okay. Which I, which part of through the

770
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,120
integrative pluralism that I really feel is emerging is a

771
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,040
the ground, the intellectual groundwork for a new enlightenment,

772
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,440
which affords the intellectual architecture in addition, you

773
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,120
know, to the sensibility and the media and the axioms and what

774
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:06,040
not, in addition. So, so if, if we can also analytically

775
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,720
diagnose the justificatory histories, okay, and demonstrate

776
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,680
where the human nature shit got wrong, and what science did,

777
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,600
and what that was wrong, and then upgrade it and say, Oh, well,

778
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,080
now we know that was wrong. And now this is what right is in a

779
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:23,640
way that, you know, a 15 year old can totally then narrate and

780
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,360
understand with reliability and validity and clarity. Yeah. Okay.

781
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,440
Then you're in a different kind of place in terms of what

782
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:35,480
affords the capacity to spread the system, because if we can get

783
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,360
it right, that the diagnosis and the upgrade analytically is

784
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,960
clear as well as the cultural flavor. And then that affords not

785
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,000
that we subordinate to it, but clear justification about what

786
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,760
this path is relative to our past. And in a little way, that

787
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,880
will afford additional momentum and capacity in getting our

788
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,560
shit together. Yes, particularly among those for whom

789
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:03,680
analytic. Exactly. Assessment is a key component, which is

790
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,920
definitely not everybody, but but in relationship to a

791
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,720
coordinating function, it could play a central coordinating

792
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,640
function in relationship. Great. Yeah, I agree. The challenge,

793
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:17,480
of course, and this is where why people like you and john play

794
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:23,480
important role is ego defense, narcissism, various forms of

795
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:30,920
fragile ego, and the unwillingness to, well, it's funny,

796
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,920
not just let's just be very precise, the degree to which the

797
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,360
ego has effectively colonized the self and protect its

798
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,080
territory, using the technique you guys very good at using.

799
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:49,160
So you know, if you happen to be an individual who is kind of

800
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,840
afforded to analytical methodologies for perceiving and

801
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,960
making sense of the world and then making choices, notice that

802
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:05,600
this thing we're describing ego, you may have pwned you at some

803
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,560
point in time. You may be particularly challenged in

804
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,800
unponing yourself because your your your primary faculty, so

805
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,800
this you this capacity to engage in this particular mode of

806
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:23,400
thinking happens to be one that is particularly gameable by the

807
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,680
ego. So you're sort of relying on something which itself

808
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,480
doesn't have your best interests in mind, and lives inside you

809
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,560
and uses your own, perhaps in some cases, tremendous

810
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:39,400
capacity to justify to justify itself, which is what it does

811
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,000
first and foremost, in all circumstances, the one thing it

812
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,600
justifies more than anything else is that it's your best buddy

813
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,160
and really needs to be in charge. And of course, complete all

814
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,480
the various games of you know, fear and shame and depression

815
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,240
on the other elements, right, it has fingers very firmly on

816
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,640
buttons that it's surrounded with systems of justification in

817
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,760
your interior. So for that portion, and here in many cases,

818
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,720
I'm often speaking to technologists creating web

819
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,840
three. Mm hmm. You got some work. You're gonna have to

820
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,960
actually step through this particular portal. I can tell

821
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,480
you, I'm of that type. And I saw this thought it through very

822
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,240
clearly. And then bootstrap myself through the portal, to

823
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,520
some extent, not particularly effectively, but better than

824
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,160
zero. So it can be done. And I would say also should and must

825
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:32,360
be done for path two, to be lift off, right? That's right

826
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,000
there. What's the other piece of it?

827
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:47,080
The analytic possibility. The other possibility, of course,

828
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:51,600
just speaks to john's video series, the meaning crisis.

829
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:56,360
Alright, this left hand side is just another way of saying the

830
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:01,440
meaning crisis. So the algorithmic transhumanist thing is

831
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,840
just cotton candy, man, you're not getting nutrition, you're

832
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:08,240
the whole soul, bad calories. And if the meaning and mental

833
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,080
health crisis and you look out across our adolescents these

834
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,080
days, and that doesn't think that maybe those are not the

835
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,520
healthiest developmental calories we should be chewing, you

836
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,960
know, if that doesn't make your skin get a little bit iffy,

837
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:26,680
right? Yeah, the data are pretty clear, people. Yeah, calories.

838
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,240
So calories. So the other side, right, there is a better way,

839
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,880
right? There's a better way. There's a there's a thing where

840
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,880
your soul is nurtured. There's this thing where you yourself is

841
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,960
seen and met. That's right. There's a place to get your soul

842
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:48,640
and spirit in right relation to the real natural relational

843
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,800
technological world we are in.

844
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:55,400
Yep. So that's the other, you know, there are other people for

845
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,400
whom that those words are the ones. And of course, they're

846
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:04,640
all part of the same whole. So all the different people and all

847
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,960
the different words so they can all be heard. And again, the

848
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,960
beauty of course, here's then we get this this this integrative

849
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,520
pluralism. Different people can have from their perspective and

850
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,400
their their aesthetics and there's the things that they have

851
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,040
seen in the beautiful aspects of reality that they've discovered

852
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,280
and found that are most precious and bring them forward and

853
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:29,400
share them for the nurturing and growth and development of each

854
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:36,000
other, which throws off this gigantic explosion of potential.

855
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,800
Lurking just on the other side of the of the what is it called

856
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,240
the eye of the needle, just on the other side of the needle. If

857
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,800
you just go through it, trick your business, you can have to

858
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,160
leave money behind. I don't mean like your personal money, I

859
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,560
mean, money as a concept.

860
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,600
Yeah, money's context, that little toxic.

861
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,040
At least as the primary as the primary mechanism for mediating

862
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,640
coordination. I don't know if he has no role in the future.

863
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,560
No, right, right, right. But as a central as the central bottom

864
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:14,720
line. Yeah, exactly. As the bottom line. No. And not even

865
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,480
necessarily part of one of a triple bottom line, but as a as a

866
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,320
piece of a much larger tapestry that we really use in the whole

867
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,560
complex whole as reality.

868
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,120
So you enforce sync up on that, which is really good, like such

869
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,480
a nice thing to have that as a proof, like it's provable. You

870
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,400
do proof on this.

871
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,240
No, it's a it's a I mean, we're I consider us we synced up to

872
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,800
start a real journey of real deep analytic deconstruction and

873
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,200
reconstruction relation. So I'm really looking forward. Yeah,

874
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,200
it's gonna be good. There's one other thing I don't know how

875
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:55,760
so what do you have? I'm on borrowed time right now, but

876
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,920
everybody's out and about. Let's keep going.

877
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,400
Alright, so here's it here. I want to drop this and see how

878
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,120
this because this came, I wanted to share this with you. They

879
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,520
listened to your last conversation on energy information

880
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:12,360
and Matthew and with Matthew. Yeah. And I wish I had more

881
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,640
background on him. So some of his proof of work concepts were

882
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:21,200
not did. I mean, I had to infer quite a bit in relationship

883
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,840
to sense making for the conversation. Yeah. But I

884
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,080
definitely look forward to syncing him up with him. And I

885
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,960
wanted to then share with you some of the stuff that I've been

886
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:37,160
doing somewhat with John on my own some coin stuff. Okay. So

887
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:44,560
with the I quite calling and connecting as I heard him talk

888
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,360
about the ribosome and those kinds of issues and the way in

889
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,400
which you're sort of the fundamental basement on energy

890
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:57,120
necessary for information and then what information is. So I'm

891
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:02,760
working on out the idea. I was working with john and we and I

892
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,600
was sort of like, I hooked on to this imaginal. Okay, concept

893
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,800
the imagine. Alright, concept of the imaginal john emphasizes

894
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,920
this is a differentiation between imaginary so fully

895
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,960
imaginary stuff that's not imaginal then is in this

896
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:22,520
intermediate space. Okay, whereby you're representing

897
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,560
something but then in representing it you afford

898
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,560
potential in utilizing it for seeing things you hadn't seen

899
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:33,920
before. Okay. And that all of a sudden that hit me in a

900
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,880
particular kind of way. All right. All right. whereby I

901
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,200
realized the concept of imaginal creates a beautiful

902
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:46,480
intermediate space between what we might call the experience of

903
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,200
the real so my say my perception of this can this is a can of

904
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,840
Dr. Pepper. Okay, and we can say, well, that's real at

905
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,200
whatever level of construction. I have a visual image of that.

906
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:02,080
But I see something that's real called Dr. Pepper. Okay. And

907
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,600
then I can have it in my head. I can have an image of that.

908
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:08,200
Yes, it corresponds to the real. Then I can imagine the Dr.

909
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,560
Pepper moving around. Okay. And wonder what it's like to drink

910
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,480
and the silver potentially an imaginal space. And then I can

911
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,800
have it sprout wings like a fairy and fly off and call that

912
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:23,520
imaginary. Okay. Okay. So what does that do that creates a

913
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,680
kind of a continuum of my immediate experience of the

914
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,800
real and my virtual, you know, experiential system, like as I'm

915
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,040
experiencing what's in what the hell is going on inside my head,

916
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,720
but my subjective conscious experience of being of the real

917
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:41,600
will call that the imaginal real. Okay, so so imaginal direct

918
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:46,640
representation, then imaginal would be possible. Okay, space

919
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,040
and then a full imaginary would then be in the space of the

920
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:55,960
counterfactual impossible. All right. So now this issue of

921
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:01,000
imaginal became a dimension around a intimate way of

922
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,600
information processing, specifying a dimension of its

923
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,680
relationship to so you have the information processor, and it's

924
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:12,040
relating to the environment in a particular kind of real way on

925
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:18,360
a continuum of the imaginary. Okay, whereby the tightest aspects

926
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:22,520
are where this imaginal real is really in good complex looping

927
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,200
with whatever out here versus okay, then imaginal and then

928
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:31,040
imaginary. Yeah. All right. And you notice that I'm doing this

929
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,960
dimension thing here, I'm creating an a y dimension up

930
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,160
here. Okay, that's then tracking the thing that it's

931
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,560
tracking. So this is the can out in the world. And then this is

932
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,960
my experience of it immediately. And then as it go up,

933
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:48,840
okay, and the imaginary. All right. All right. So here's the

934
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:55,120
reason that I'm doing this. Okay. This is that I believe that

935
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,640
there is a deep relationship between what I just specified at

936
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,800
the level of the imaginal and the real and the relationship

937
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:06,720
between real numbers and imaginary numbers. Oh crap. Okay.

938
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,840
Okay, in the way in which mathematics thinks about

939
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,200
imaginary numbers as being orthogonal to the real numbers.

940
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,240
Okay. And the way in which then when you do an imaginary and

941
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:25,040
real, you get a complex number plane. Okay. All right. The

942
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:29,320
trend. So here's what's the here's now a working map. There's

943
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:33,640
an imaginal layer of information processing in a subject. Okay,

944
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:38,400
that corresponds then that's embedded in the real world. All

945
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,080
right. There's a dimension upon which there's a mapping of

946
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:47,320
that of that whereby you engage in in an interactive system that

947
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:51,600
you can then talk the complex, transjective interactive, which

948
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,920
is basically as my imaginal system is connecting with the

949
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:59,120
real, then there will be a complex interface. Okay. All

950
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:03,800
right. I'm believing that we may have been a way to take the

951
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,800
topology of imaginary and real numbers and complex numbers.

952
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,240
Okay. And basically impute that onto Oh, the shit that happens

953
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:18,400
inside my head is akin to an imaginal dimension relative to

954
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,440
the real. And then I interface that with in a complex

955
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,720
transjective plane.

956
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,040
Sorry, ma'am. I do not I do not I cannot follow and I don't

957
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:37,080
mean in any way to say I disagree. I literally like when you

958
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,320
heard me say oh shit, like when you interjected the complex

959
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:46,640
numbers with imaginary numbers. Uh huh. I don't know my my I

960
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,560
cannot follow down that particular route. I'll try one more

961
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:53,080
little thing and let's see then we can drop this. Okay. There's

962
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,720
some stuff here that I'd like to feed back to you. There's

963
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,840
connects back to my conversation with Matthew and it may it may

964
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:00,240
look like there may be certain that happens or maybe that we

965
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,400
actually have to do this tri adequately. For example. Okay.

966
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:05,440
All right. So here's the so I was trying to explain this to my

967
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,440
parents. So first you have sort of energy and then you have

968
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,640
matter. Okay, then you know, I have the life, mind and culture

969
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,400
that are coming off of matter. Okay. And the tree of knowledge.

970
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,640
Right. Okay. So life, then really what I'm representing with

971
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:23,360
life is the complex adaptive plane of information processing

972
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,800
and communication that give rise to this complex network. Okay.

973
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,360
The semantic content of life then is being thought of as an

974
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,280
imaginary orthogonal dimension to matter.

975
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,320
Okay. So can I can I say it slightly differently? Please. Can

976
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:50,360
I say that it is a transcendent? And again, kind of like the

977
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:54,720
Landry sense or in the sense of like a Kantian sense even. Sure.

978
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:58,240
Okay, we're saying more or less the same thing. Yep. Okay,

979
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:02,480
great. Yep. So to say the language back. And this is actually

980
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,200
kind of interrupts. Let's do it. Let's do it more like this. Yep.

981
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:22,960
We can do this very easily. I got a real cow. And I got a real

982
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,840
bucket. And I need to tell you, Hey, would you mind taking that

983
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:32,920
bucket over that cow and milk the cow? Now we have this really

984
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,160
cool thing where I can replace the actual physical real cow,

985
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,720
which is heavy and over there with this sound cow, which

986
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:46,000
resembles it in many ways, not at all. Totally. And yet, enables

987
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,680
us to coordinate our orientation so that shit can

988
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:53,880
happen. Now, on paper, you know, this is sort of classic

989
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,720
semiotics, I have a I'll draw a picture of a cow, which is

990
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,200
already representation. I've got the word cow. And they are

991
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:05,320
both pointing to something that is is real. But it is

992
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,120
transcendent, right? It is neither the physical embodied

993
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:12,600
actual metabolic cow or the sound cow. And yet, there's a way

994
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,520
for them to be pointing at the same kind of thing, which you're

995
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,720
now saying that's the at the imaginary that is or the

996
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:21,440
imaginal that's in the imaginal plane, the imaginal mode. Yes,

997
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:27,120
okay. And then we have two, we have three three things, right?

998
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,480
First is that that can happen. That's part of the universe we

999
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:35,560
live in is that can happen. The second is that there is an

1000
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:41,040
energetic benefit and energetic cost associated with that move.

1001
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:47,400
The cost is the information processor that has the capacity

1002
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,720
to do whatever sorts of sort of perception, disambiguation,

1003
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:57,360
pattern recognition work necessary to be able to map to

1004
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:03,680
percept or tons to each other. The energetic savings is a

1005
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:07,000
benefit is what you can do when you don't have to actually

1006
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,280
physically walk over and touch the cow and wave the bucket

1007
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:14,120
around, but can actually just issue the sentence. Yeah. So

1008
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:17,960
there's sort of this trade off brain, right? The the innovation

1009
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:21,560
of brain is the discovery of the potential available when you

1010
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:24,840
have an organ of information processing potential of a brain

1011
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,640
that can then use systems of justification linguistically to

1012
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,040
coordinate them into a distributed cognition function,

1013
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,640
which enables an unlocking of a tremendous amount of

1014
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,280
information compression in the transcendent or in the

1015
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,920
imaginal space, which is what we're doing right now. Alright,

1016
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:44,840
so. Brilliant. Yeah. So, so, right. So now that what the

1017
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,560
Tree of Knowledge saying is that you look at a life and that

1018
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:52,760
life, the semantics of life at the cell level, the RNA DNA

1019
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,920
when he's describing the ribosome, so that information

1020
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,360
store that affords the complex dynamics of a cell to make its

1021
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:03,920
decisions in relation is I life, imaginal life. It's the

1022
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,800
it's the semantics of okay, that they can't be reduced to the

1023
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:11,080
fucking matter because it's this instantiated modeling of

1024
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:15,080
matter and it communicates at this network-binded level. So

1025
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,600
then it affords us that what is the semantic binding that's

1026
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,480
modeling the reality through this information network that

1027
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,040
then is doing it based on energy constraints, as they was

1028
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,440
talking about. So it's the information relative to energy

1029
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:29,840
constraint. Yeah. And then that's the cell DNA, RNA

1030
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,120
communication network structure that gives rise to what we

1031
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,680
call the life plane of existence. Then it's mediated by this

1032
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:41,600
kind of imaginal processing. And then you upgrade that. So now

1033
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,680
you get a dimensional of imagination, imaginal around

1034
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:48,400
neuro cognition through a brain and the animal mindedness of

1035
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,520
sensory motor looping. And it's doing an imaginal in

1036
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,480
relationship to the biological. So it then drops the imaginal up

1037
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:59,480
a degree. So that's a secondary imaginal. And then us through a

1038
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:04,120
proposition, we get a third tertiary imagine. Yep. Okay. And

1039
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:07,880
now we can stack the imaginal languages upon each other. And

1040
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,600
the relationship is this orthogonal informational

1041
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,600
relation. Yes. And then sort of kind of use the metaphor you

1042
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,480
used earlier. The thing that Matthew and I were talking

1043
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,800
about is the distinction between the proof of work

1044
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,520
methodology and the fake methodology is the distinction

1045
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,520
between the imaginal and the imaginary. Exactly. Yes. Okay.

1046
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:32,040
proof of stake has as it's sort of it has a dairy Doridian a

1047
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:41,320
dairy da. Hold on. Just crash the internet again. Back proof

1048
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:44,720
of stake. Yes. The last I heard was proof of stake proof of

1049
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,920
stake is effectively identical isomorphic to many of the

1050
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:53,720
problems we were just discussing in terms of like dairy

1051
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,960
does point around language. If it's entirely self

1052
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,520
referential, if a word means only its relationship to all the

1053
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:05,000
other words in a language, then it's not it's not bound to

1054
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,040
reality. It's not bound to nature. It's not bound to

1055
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:15,200
anything other than its own systems of justification. Actually,

1056
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,880
as it turns out, the only the only way you can get there is

1057
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,000
actually already when you've lost the plot and have self

1058
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,200
identified the ego, the systems of justification as reality. And

1059
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,480
then you kind of look around go nothing the systems of

1060
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,720
justification around here. And then you know that you run off

1061
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:35,560
on that on that sort of in some sense preordained dead end

1062
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:38,600
journey. But you're like, no, no, no, there is a way there is

1063
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,960
as you say, Hey, if I if I'm just doing something very simple,

1064
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:45,680
like say, Hey, would you bring me that hammer? And the loop has

1065
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:50,000
a loop that goes from the informational into the energetic,

1066
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:53,600
meaning did you actually did the Greg actually hear what I was

1067
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,280
saying, understand it, walk over grab the object notice hammer

1068
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:59,160
and bring it to me. If yes, that loop right the loop from the

1069
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:02,880
informational down to the energetic backup is real. And

1070
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,360
that's part of reality. If you're running in just the

1071
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:09,600
algorithm, just the informational, it's unconnected to

1072
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,800
reality and is sort of preordained to closure and

1073
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,480
entropic noise in a finite time relatively quickly, by the way.

1074
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:21,600
But if I'm looping it, you know, and that's just in complex

1075
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,160
space, there's we use the word of complex dynamic space, and

1076
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,560
that's life, right? Then I'm just engaging in adaptive life.

1077
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,840
And so, so by the way, the hypothesis here, which is, I'm

1078
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:38,240
gonna say, that's what it feels like it may be a big deal is to

1079
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:44,840
say this thing, proof of work, which I learned as a, like a

1080
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:51,240
pragmatic notion. Oh, it's a way of solving a particular kind of

1081
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:56,280
kind of game theoretic problem, which has resolved a mathematical

1082
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,960
question around the Byzantine general's problem. Okay, I

1083
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:05,120
can almost like, but just inside that book, go, Okay, okay, I

1084
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,520
get how it solves that problem. This is a very different

1085
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:11,000
proposition. The proposition here to say no, no, no, this is the

1086
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:17,200
thing that enables the joint point, evoking Greg H, the joint

1087
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:22,960
point of person culture space to actually move to whatever this

1088
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,120
next level is. That's the thing that I'm pointing out, which is

1089
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,400
why I had to CC you on this one, right? The purpose is that this

1090
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:34,800
thing, proof of work is the thing that enables computation,

1091
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:39,600
which is information processing, qua information

1092
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,600
processing, because if we're looking now at technology,

1093
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,920
qua technology, not any artifact of technology, we're

1094
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,720
looking at computation, qua computation, information

1095
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:52,520
processing, information theory, information in and of itself.

1096
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,040
Proof of work is nothing more or less than the mechanism by

1097
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:03,840
which that is strictly bound to energy. And that if you don't

1098
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,480
have energy bound information bound to energy, then

1099
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:11,520
information flies off into a an entropic closure, which goes to

1100
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,160
noise in a finite time. If you do have it bound, then you're

1101
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,200
beginning to actually do something which is happening in

1102
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,360
the real. And you can begin to build on that.

1103
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,920
Like a complex system.

1104
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:29,760
Yeah. So so I'm now a I'm now a proof of work maximalist.

1105
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:35,320
Yeah. Yeah. And what that does is it affords a foundational

1106
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,720
linkage between a foundational concept to foundational

1107
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:42,920
concepts, okay, of energy and information on the one hand.

1108
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,960
And now the ease with which you metabolize what I was saying

1109
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:53,160
once I rotated a bit, okay, the the this relationship between

1110
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,520
these dimensions of complexification, this life

1111
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,960
mind and culture ship, okay, to go back to what I was saying,

1112
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:04,120
like we can upgrade the old misunderstandings, the entire

1113
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,160
enlightenment failed to appreciate how to fucking get

1114
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:12,640
from matter in motion into actual, what do we mean by life?

1115
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,480
What do we mean by mind? What do we mean by culture? Because

1116
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:18,040
they were operating on a particular set of assumptions

1117
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:23,640
of what the real had to be. Okay. And now that we can point in

1118
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:27,360
mathematics to the logical relations between structures

1119
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:31,400
like between real and imaginary numbers and the orthogonal

1120
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,560
mapping between those that actually transposed in the

1121
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:38,920
relationship between real and information processing. All right.

1122
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,000
We are afforded to me what I'm wondering about is we're

1123
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:49,000
affording a particular framing that has long eluded our

1124
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:53,240
understanding basically between matter and mind ultimately

1125
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,880
or between energy and a matter and a life and a mind and a

1126
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:00,720
culture into the forms that we are using to map the substances

1127
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:04,960
and to create a transjective conforming grip between being

1128
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,560
and thinking into a clear metaphysics.

1129
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:15,520
Yeah. Yeah, just as a nice, how does it not even caveat, but

1130
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:20,320
just a nice thing to put out there. My mind does not handle

1131
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,560
certain kinds of math particularly well. And I can tell

1132
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,160
you right now that I have I've endeavored mightily to

1133
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:30,000
understand what the fuck are meant by imaginary numbers. I can

1134
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,240
get them down to their formulas. I can use them. I can do

1135
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:36,120
stuff with it. Right. But I kind of got nothing. Like it feels

1136
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:41,800
very weirdly almost panic. Whoa. But you know, barring that

1137
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:46,240
leap right there. The continuity of what you were just

1138
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,360
describing. And we could probably continue to kind of

1139
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,120
massage it and hammer on it. I get where you're going. I get

1140
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,960
them. I get the point. Let me see. There's some other things

1141
01:15:55,040 --> 01:16:00,560
that came up. So yes, I think that Oh, okay, there's a couple.

1142
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,640
One is an acknowledgement, a thing that we should acknowledge

1143
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:09,880
as a culture. You know, we're on the one hand, we're standing

1144
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:13,240
on the shoulders of giants. On the other hand, we're standing

1145
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,600
on foundations of sand. beautifully. So right, these are

1146
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:21,760
both true. And the guys were doing their best with very, very

1147
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:26,280
limited frameworks, ability to experiment, coordination

1148
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:31,120
capacity. And there's a lot of path dependent stuff that was

1149
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,680
outweighing the swept into the rug. Like, shit, I don't

1150
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,240
understand how that works. Well, fuck it, I got to figure out

1151
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,920
how to do this problem over here. Fine. Simplify, reify. Hope

1152
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:42,040
it doesn't come up until after you know, my job is done, which

1153
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,880
is a pretty human thing. What a human nature. That's a very

1154
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,160
human thing to do. Sounds like a reasonable justification.

1155
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:51,480
Exactly. And it's okay. Like it's okay for us to actually

1156
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,760
zoom back and look at something and say, Oh, all right,

1157
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,760
let's, let's take this unexamined for 300 years set of

1158
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:02,320
axiomatics. Oh, boy, these are really, really not particularly

1159
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,840
functional. All right, fine. So unplug that, let's expand it

1160
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,760
back out. See, geez, look at all this structure that was built

1161
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:11,760
on top of a bunch of actually quite poor axiomatics. How much

1162
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,280
of that can we just throw away? Well, a lot of it. What can we

1163
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,120
build new neat stuff? Can we plug a lot of old stuff into it?

1164
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,280
Sure. Because most of the old stuff was actually just

1165
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,440
pragmatic, having to do with what really works in a real

1166
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:25,200
world, right? Or looping it all the way back, by the way, the

1167
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:29,560
technocratic error. Technocratic error is built on top of a lot

1168
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:33,920
of those axiomatic errors in a deep way. And it's not it's a

1169
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:38,360
problem. It's something that it had the loops have not closed to

1170
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:42,400
force the capitulation that it's a problem, but it's a problem.

1171
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,000
And we can again, we can argue that ad nauseum, which Matthew

1172
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,400
actually does a quite a good job at in language that doesn't

1173
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,920
you know, nobody's going to understand. None of the tech

1174
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,080
none of those who are motivated enough to understand it will

1175
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,160
understand it's a bit of a right, right, right. But yes, that

1176
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,120
acknowledgement of saying, Hey, we actually are in a position

1177
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,560
where we can use these things like zoomed dialogues and

1178
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,080
integrative pluralism to radically upgrade the robustness of

1179
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,320
the way that we go about thinking about this whole story,

1180
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:12,200
we're not beholden in an enlightened era, or modernist

1181
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:16,360
era, or late 20th century, like we're not beholden too much, if

1182
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,880
anything really mean the whole point of this integrative

1183
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,560
pluralism frame is like, look, Greg and I met what two years

1184
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:27,640
ago. If that you've got a vast, you know, long lifetime of

1185
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:30,440
thinking about lots of things. Right. And from point of view,

1186
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,800
that's not my native point of view. I've got my own stuff. And

1187
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,960
yet, we've been able to figure out how to achieve generative

1188
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,640
dialogue. Effectively, instantly, this is a key thing

1189
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,760
like media. And then it continued the process. So it's

1190
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:48,960
a total one grip, and then it can expand. And it's, it's like

1191
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,520
useful from the very get go, and continues to have richness,

1192
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,600
which is nice. Right, you don't have to have this, it sucks for

1193
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,000
two years, and it's useless, then hope it works out and get a

1194
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,880
payload at the end, you can actually have a nice smooth. Okay,

1195
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,280
cool. This is an interesting insight. I walk away from this

1196
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:07,040
with some increased capacity, more meaningful existence in life

1197
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,480
and reality, and notice that it just affords more possibility on

1198
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:14,440
the afford basis. Totally on my end as well. And that's the

1199
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:20,720
synergy of it. And man, we tap that. Yeah. And now I am. Yeah,

1200
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,320
the borrowed time is definitely no longer. It's been called due.

1201
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:28,720
So, I hear. Good to see you, Ron. Me too. So it's a, hey, man.

1202
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,600
Enjoyed it. Yeah, bye bye.
