Checking Jordan Hall/Conversation with Gregg Henriques (Nov 6, 2021).txt
 The conversation touches on the recognition of historical limitations and errors in foundational assumptions and axiomatics that have been built upon over time. There's an acknowledgment that past thinkers did their best with the knowledge and resources available to them, but some of what they created was based on shaky ground due to path-dependent choices and swept-under-the-rug issues.

The discussion shifts to the importance of re-examining these axiomatic assumptions and questioning the validity of long-standing, entrenched systems and structures, including technocratic approaches that may be flawed. The speakers emphasize the potential for current generations to use frameworks like zoomed dialogues and integrative pluralism to revise and upgrade the way we approach problems and thinking.

They highlight the success of their own communication as an example of how generative dialogue can be immediate, productive, and continuously enriching, without the need for a long, possibly fruitless, period of initial struggle. This synergy between individuals with different backgrounds and perspectives can lead to meaningful insights and increased capacity for life and reality.

The conversation concludes with a sense of excitement about the potential for tapping into this synergy and the end of "borrowed time," indicating that the ideas discussed are immediately applicable and hold great promise for future endeavors. The speakers part on a positive note, appreciating the depth and breadth of their exchange.
