Oh, right. Okay, let me just show you. Let me just finish up real quick.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.500
Ready?

01:43.500 --> 01:48.500
Wait, I don't follow this.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.500
It's a doughnut.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.500
It's incredible, isn't it?

01:54.500 --> 02:00.500
So all of this just to render a doughnut on your terminal?

02:03.500 --> 02:04.500
What the f-

02:05.500 --> 02:11.500
Thanks for watching. The idea and code were originally from the amazing Andy Sloan.

02:11.500 --> 02:19.500
Where he was able to code this whole program in C and made the code itself look like a doughnut.

02:19.500 --> 02:24.500
He has an article explaining how the code works, which I'll link in the description.

02:24.500 --> 02:27.500
So why is math important for programming?

02:27.500 --> 02:35.500
Well, it's because even if 99% of the time you won't need it, there's a 1% chance that you might.

02:35.500 --> 02:41.500
And it's in those moments that separate out a great programmer from average ones.

02:41.500 --> 02:50.500
And if you do know your math, you'll know how to modify this doughnut to increase the size, change the rotation, or even make a cube instead.

02:51.500 --> 02:57.500
Also, if you want to do computer graphics, machine learning or cryptography, you're going to need math.

02:57.500 --> 03:01.500
So might as well get good at it as you did for programming.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.500
Anyway, back to the doughnut. How do we write this program?

03:06.500 --> 03:19.500
Well, first you have to create a doughnut, which is essentially a solid of revolution where we have a circle that rotates around the y-axis, which will make a doughnut, a.k.a. a tourist.

03:19.500 --> 03:26.500
This is the formula to create the circle centered at R2 with radius R1.

03:26.500 --> 03:32.500
And this is the rotation matrix to rotate this circle around the y-axis.

03:32.500 --> 03:37.500
So when we combine them, we get the coordinates of every point on your doughnut.

03:37.500 --> 03:42.500
Now that we have a doughnut, shut up, I know this is a bagel.

03:42.500 --> 03:50.500
Now that we have a doughnut, we want to rotate it around the x and z-axis so it looks cool or flying and stuff.

03:50.500 --> 03:56.500
We can do that by multiplying our doughnut coordinates with these two rotation matrices.

03:56.500 --> 04:04.500
Now we have to map this 3D flying doughnut onto a 2D screen, which will become our terminal.

04:04.500 --> 04:09.500
So each character on the terminal will be a pixel on the screen.

04:09.500 --> 04:17.500
To figure out how to shade our doughnut, we calculate the dot product of the surface normal and the direction of the light.

04:17.500 --> 04:22.500
So as you can see, when the normal points this way, it's way brighter.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.500
And when it points that way, it's way darker.

04:25.500 --> 04:29.500
So the dot product will tell us how light or dark it is.

04:29.500 --> 04:36.500
We take the result of the dot product and map it into these characters from darkest to brightest.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.500
And lastly, we draw that on our terminal.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.500
And voila!

04:40.500 --> 04:46.500
