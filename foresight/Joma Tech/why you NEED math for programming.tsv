72500	78500	Oh, right. Okay, let me just show you. Let me just finish up real quick.
89500	90500	Ready?
103500	108500	Wait, I don't follow this.
108500	110500	It's a doughnut.
110500	112500	It's incredible, isn't it?
114500	120500	So all of this just to render a doughnut on your terminal?
123500	124500	What the f-
125500	131500	Thanks for watching. The idea and code were originally from the amazing Andy Sloan.
131500	139500	Where he was able to code this whole program in C and made the code itself look like a doughnut.
139500	144500	He has an article explaining how the code works, which I'll link in the description.
144500	147500	So why is math important for programming?
147500	155500	Well, it's because even if 99% of the time you won't need it, there's a 1% chance that you might.
155500	161500	And it's in those moments that separate out a great programmer from average ones.
161500	170500	And if you do know your math, you'll know how to modify this doughnut to increase the size, change the rotation, or even make a cube instead.
171500	177500	Also, if you want to do computer graphics, machine learning or cryptography, you're going to need math.
177500	181500	So might as well get good at it as you did for programming.
182500	186500	Anyway, back to the doughnut. How do we write this program?
186500	199500	Well, first you have to create a doughnut, which is essentially a solid of revolution where we have a circle that rotates around the y-axis, which will make a doughnut, a.k.a. a tourist.
199500	206500	This is the formula to create the circle centered at R2 with radius R1.
206500	212500	And this is the rotation matrix to rotate this circle around the y-axis.
212500	217500	So when we combine them, we get the coordinates of every point on your doughnut.
217500	222500	Now that we have a doughnut, shut up, I know this is a bagel.
222500	230500	Now that we have a doughnut, we want to rotate it around the x and z-axis so it looks cool or flying and stuff.
230500	236500	We can do that by multiplying our doughnut coordinates with these two rotation matrices.
236500	244500	Now we have to map this 3D flying doughnut onto a 2D screen, which will become our terminal.
244500	249500	So each character on the terminal will be a pixel on the screen.
249500	257500	To figure out how to shade our doughnut, we calculate the dot product of the surface normal and the direction of the light.
257500	262500	So as you can see, when the normal points this way, it's way brighter.
262500	265500	And when it points that way, it's way darker.
265500	269500	So the dot product will tell us how light or dark it is.
269500	276500	We take the result of the dot product and map it into these characters from darkest to brightest.
276500	279500	And lastly, we draw that on our terminal.
279500	280500	And voila!
280500	286500	If you like the way I teach, you can check out my new course on data structures and algorithms,
286500	292500	where I use easy to understand animations to explain these concepts.
