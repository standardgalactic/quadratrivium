The Bell Telephone System brings you one of a series of programs on science to understand nature's laws.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.000
The Bell Telephone System brings you one of a series of programs on science to understand nature's laws.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Let's try that focus again, Jim.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Coming up.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
The title's okay.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Now let's test that first animation.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Roll two.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Okay, hold it.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Now sharpen the focus.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Right.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Hold roll two.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Doctor, how is the son born?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Don't know exactly.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
You're a scientist and you don't know?

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Could use my imagination, but you're the fiction writer.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Imagination?

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Well, we could ask Mr. Sun himself.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Yes, if we had a magic wand.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Sure, sure.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
You've got it.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Magic.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Your science and my magic.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
We'll open up our story of our Mr. Sun with a little fantasy.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
You know, showmanship.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Go back into time.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Show the birth of the sun out of time, stardust.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Here, we'll turn back the clock.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Oh, that'll only take you back 12 hours.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Oh.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
All right.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
We'll open up the curtain of our imagination.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
This'll be our magic screen.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Yours will be just for facts.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
We'll pull back the curtains of our magic screen.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
We'll dream up a clock.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
There you are.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
A clock that's been ticking since time began.

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
Our solar system wound up by Father Time himself.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Do you see what I'm seeing?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Well, certainly.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Maybe I could talk to him, huh?

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Hey, Father Time, how long has that sun clock been going?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
A few billion years.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Why?

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Well, could you unwind it for us?

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Unwind time?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Man, are you crazy?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Well, I'm a fiction writer.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
We're auditioning a show about our Mr. Sun,

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
and I thought that...

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Show about me?

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Well, well, about time.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Look who's here.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Hi.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah, we were wondering how it all happened at the beginning.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Nobody knows what happened at the beginning.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Oh, come on.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Pop, unwind us.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
They want to see how I was born.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
You... you old hot gas bag.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
You keep still.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Now, don't flip your sickle, Pop.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
The man says it's just a show.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
He's a romantic fool.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
If you want facts, ask your scientists.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Oh, we've got doctor research here for facts.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
But what I need right now is something to open this thing up with a bang.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
You know what I mean?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Certainly.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
My story should be colorful, romantic, not just facts.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Here, I'll tell you how it should open.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Wait a minute.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I'm telling this story.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
You're just imaginary.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Quiet.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
You want a show, don't you?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Go on.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Yes, sir?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Set the stage for me.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Oh, yes, sir.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Uh-uh.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
You had an Academy Award, really.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Hey, he's taking over.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
How do you like that?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
I like it.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Let him go on.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Music.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Lights.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Color.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
And here, Mr. Sun from the East.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Good morning, Brother Earth.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
For the empty billionth time.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Good morning.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Good morning, Brother Bird.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Brother Mountain.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Brother Sea.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Morning to you, Brother Gal.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Brother Bee.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Brother Fish.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Good morning, all of you.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Great day.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Every day's a great day.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
You know me as the sun.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
Of course, what I really am is a star.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
An average, everyday type of star.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Billions like me.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
I remember when Primitive Man first began to look up

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
to gaze in wonderment at the stars and planets

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
sweeping across the face of the sky.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
That primitive curiosity was the beginning of all your science.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Of course, they had some pretty odd notions about me.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Some thought I was an enormous beetle

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
crumbling a fiery ball across the heavens.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
The ancient Eskimos thought I was a little man

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
wearing thick furs to keep myself warm.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
But to most, I was a god.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Fancy names and wardrobes.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
In Babylon, I was Shamash.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And my sun temples were observatories.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
In Persia, I was Mithras.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
And to ancient Egypt, I was the great god Rah.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Glory to the great sun god.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
Hold our perfect, our eternal, our only one.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Blame me for getting the swell head.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
Ah, but the name I like best was Phoebus Apollo.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
The Greeks always didn't have a word for it.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
In my case, it was handsome.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Apollo racing across the sky in his fiery chariot

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
making heavenly music on his golden ukulele.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Oh, that was for me.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I loved it.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
And then along came another Greek to spoil it all.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
A Greek who would rather think than worship sun gods.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Anaxagoras was his name.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
The sun is not a god or a person.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
It is a mass of red hot stone,

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
only 40 miles across and 4,000 miles away.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
For blaspheming against the beautiful Apollo,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Anaxagoras was banished from Athens.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
And I wasn't a bit sorry for him.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
But man had fallen for this new and fascinating mistress, his brain.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Thinking began spreading like the measles.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Everybody got the bug.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
The Greeks with their logic and philosophy.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
The Hindus with their algebra and your present number system.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
The Arabs with their early instruments like the astrolabe.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
And today instead of temples, rituals and hymns to the sun,

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
it's domes, gadgets, charts and numbers.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
I'm demoted to a specimen, a pile of facts and figures.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
A big blob of mass holding little blobs of mass together with gravity.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
Instead of with love, I think you're all through.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Who's all through?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Earthman. He's had it.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
Why you flaming idiot, I haven't even started yet.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
In worshiping me, ancient man was reaching for the great light beyond.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
But modern man, he's got all the answers.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Mr. Sun, you mind if I butt in a moment?

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Who are you?

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
Who me? Oh, I'm the...

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
Never mind. Thank you very much. Goodbye.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Would you mind if we listened in?

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
See here, you're not even real. I just made you up. You go wind your clock.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
No, let them stay. I like your magic. Father Time, my name's Research.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Who?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
A scientist.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Hmm.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Howdy, Doctor Research.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
I'd like to hear what you have to say about Golden Boy here.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
Well, it's a delightful experience talking directly to you and to Mr. Sun, especially for a scientist.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
I was just going to relate a few facts about Mr. Sun.

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
Facts? If you're going to tell my story, don't give the people equations and figures.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Give them the real old doubt. Tell them what I mean to them.

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
They've forgotten that. When they eat corn or bread or grapes or meat, they're eating sunlight.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Their houses, furniture, cars, they're nylons.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
Yes, even their moonshine is sunshine.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
Tell them if it wasn't for me, they'd have no eyes, because there'd be nothing to see.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
That's enough. You're getting purple.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
Why, if I put my light out, every living thing on Earth would be frozen stiff.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
And you scientists who know would be just as cold and stiff as the people that don't know.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Through blowing sunspots?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Yes.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Then apologize to Doctor Research.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
Well, I'm sorry, Brother Research.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
No apology necessary. Mr. Sun is almost right.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Almost?

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Yes. Mr. Sun, your logic is a little on the romantic side, too.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
You say that you don't like facts, and yet you've just given us quite a list of them.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
This may turn out to be fun.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
No, Mr. Sun, we haven't got all the answers.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Science has just opened the book, yet in seeking for more knowledge,

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
we, too, in a way, are reaching for the great light beyond.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Doctor, that's it. That's it.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
What's it? The gimmick.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Come into my office here.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
We put the show on for him.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
For the Sun?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Sure. It's a tough audience.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Science shows Sun were not all through, you get it?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Could be boring to him.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Could be.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
You keep your corona on.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Science has found out about you as more exciting than any fiction.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
You stick around, you'll see.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
What we really don't know very much about him.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Oh, we know plenty about him.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
What about the television people?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Never mind him.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Just think, we've got a real show here.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Well, you remember where you come in.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I remember the weather, the fuel, the entertainment.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
And you cut in on me if I get stuff in.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
I'll cut in on you, but come on.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Roll him, roll him.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Roll to.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Here we go.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
Although Mr. Sun is 93 million miles away,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
and it takes his life eight minutes to reach us,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
we're pretty close.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
The light from the next nearest star,

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
traveling at 186,000 miles per second,

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
takes over four years to get to us.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
We know Mr. Sun is so large,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
our Earth is barely visible alongside him.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
It would take some 340 worlds, like beads on a string,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
to make a necklace around his shining sphere.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
How much does Mr. Sun weigh?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
1,000 worlds?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
100,000?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
No, sir.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
He weighs as much as 330,000 Mother Earths.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
We also know that Mr. Sun is not solid or liquid,

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
but a fiery ball of hot, glowing gases,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
consisting of some 95% hydrogen and helium,

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
and a few percent all other elements.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
We know that this huge cloud of hot gases

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
would expand, float away, dissipate into space,

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
unless gravity squeezed it together into a tight sphere.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
The gases at the center of the Sun are so densely packed by gravity

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
that they're about 100 times heavier than water.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
And the pressure is around 1 billion tons to the square inch.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
While at the surface, the gases are so thin,

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
the pressure is only about one pound to the square inch.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
We know too that the temperature at the core of the Sun

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
is incredibly hot, around 30 million degrees Fahrenheit.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
While at the surface, it drops down to just about 10,000 degrees.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
But here's a strange thing.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
As we go out from the Sun into the corona,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
the temperature goes up again

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
to over 1 million degrees at the outer edges.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Tell them why, Dr. Research.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
We don't know why.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
You don't? Well, what is the corona anyway?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
We don't actually know that yet.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
But we do know there's more to Mr. Sun

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
than the shining surface we normally see,

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
which we call a photosphere or sphere of light.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
Only when the moon moves between us and the Sun

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
and covers the photosphere completely in a total eclipse

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
can we see the rest of Mr. Sun's thin atmosphere,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
the beautiful and mysterious corona.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
For many, many years, scientists have lugged their instruments

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
to all parts of the globe chasing eclipses.

13:00.000 --> 13:09.000
Music

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Expedition spending months,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
just for a two or three-minute opportunity to see,

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
measure, and photograph the eclipsed Sun.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Sometimes heavy clouds, failure, complete washout.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Sometimes light clouds, measurements uncertain.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
But on happy occasions, perfect conditions.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
The corona is studied and photographed

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
in the fullness of its glory.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
Music

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Your corona is most puzzling to us, Mr. Sun.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
We know that it rotates with you,

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
but at no two eclipses does it look just the same.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
It pulsates, changes shape,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
and at times extends out millions of miles.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Why is that?

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Just one of the many things we still don't know about the Sun.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
Look, have we better tell him something we do know?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Want to hear any more, Mr. Sun?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I like your pictures of me.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Got any more?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Oh, yes, lots.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Roll six.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
The camera's one of our main tools.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Now, here's a normal picture of you taken by direct sunlight.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
It's rather flat.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Your face has little expression.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
But about 60 years ago,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Dr. George Ellery Hale of America

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
and Dr. Henri Delant of France

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
conceived this ingenious instrument

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
called the spectrogeliograph.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
It filters out all the light waves,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
except the light from some particular glowing atom,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
as for instance, hydrogen.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
Let's look at a normal white light picture of the Sun again.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Now, here, taken at the same time,

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
is a spectrogeliogram that photographed

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
only the red light from glowing hydrogen atoms.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
Now, your face is interesting, reveals character.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
Here's another spectrogeliogram taken at the same time,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
that photographed only the violet light

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
from incandescent calcium atoms,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
which tells us even more about you.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
With the spectrogeliograph,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Dr. Robert R. McMath

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
of the McMath-Hulbert Observatory near Pontiac, Michigan

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
made the first time-lapse motion pictures

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
of the prominences and wrinkles on the face of the Sun.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
From his pictures and from the many thousands of photographs

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
taken at observatories all over the world,

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
particularly at the Mount Wilson Observatory,

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
we've learned a great deal about Mr. Sun,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
especially about those much-talked-of sunspots

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
that mystified Galileo.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Ah, sunspots. There are such things, of course.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Oh, yeah.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
They're not just something that scientists see when they're tired.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Oh, they're very real, but very mysterious.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
They mystified Galileo

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
and through his original telescope,

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
he first saw them moving daily across the face of the Sun.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
And they've been mystifying us ever since.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Spots can appear singly, like this one,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
or in groups like these,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
and quite often in distinct pairs.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
When photographed by red hydrogen light,

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
they look something like giant, violet tornadoes

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
seen from above.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Spots range in size from mere pinpoints

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
just a few hundred miles across,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
into which you could drop the British Isles,

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
to huge ones,

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
into which you could drop 100 planets as big as the Earth.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Spots look dark, although they really aren't,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
because they're cooler than the rest of the surface.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
7,000 degrees is against 10,000 degrees of the surface.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Also, over the years,

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
we notice a strange fluctuation in the number of spots,

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
increasing to a maximum, decreasing to a minimum,

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
in more or less regular 11-year cycles,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
which many of us believe affect our weather,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
our crops, and the growth of our trees.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
One of the most astonishing mysteries

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
revealed by study of spots, Mr. Sun,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
is that your equator, or the middle of you,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
rotates faster than the rest of you.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
The middle rotates faster?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Yes.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
For instance, if a line of spots

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
were placed like runners at a starting line,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
from the sun's north to the south pole,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
and a signal raced around the sun,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
they would end up like this.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
Equator wins in 25 and one-third days.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Half north and half south tie for second,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
time 27 and a half days.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Why is that?

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
You don't know why, okay.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Have you got any more pictures of me?

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Hey, would it please you to know, Mr. Glory Puss,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
that you've been photographed

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
more than all the Hollywood stars put together?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
The most dramatic pictures, roll seven,

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
the most dramatic pictures are taken with a chronograph,

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
which creates automatic total eclipses

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
whenever the sun is shining.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
This very remarkable instrument was first constructed

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
by Dr. Bernard Leo of France in 1930.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Today, there are improved chronographs

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
at the High Altitude Observatory at Climax, Colorado,

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
under the direction of Dr. Walter Roberts,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
and at the Air Force installation

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
at Sacramento Peak, New Mexico,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
presided over by Dr. J. W. Evans.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
The first user of the chronograph in America

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
was Dr. Donald H. Menzel of Harvard University.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
What happens in these red-hydrogen

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
chronograph motion pictures in one second

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
actually took place in about five minutes on the sun.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
The small sphere you see here

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
represents the size of the Earth in comparison with the sun.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
Your surface, Mr. Sun, is a stormy sea of violent motion.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Small spicules or geysers like these

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
continually burst from blisters on the surface

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
and jet up like little fountains,

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
if you can call five or 10,000 miles up, little,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
compare them to the size of the Earth.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
Big flame-like eruptions like these are called prominences.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
They're vast clouds of gas that sometimes float idly

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
and other times shoot out at thousands of miles per minute

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
as if they'd ever heard of gravity.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
Sometimes they rise in graceful ribbons or tangle streamers.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Beautiful, beautiful.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
Some surge up like gigantic geysers.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Others flow sideways and downward,

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
at times forming natural bridges.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Portions of the prominences may even break off

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
and go floating away as in this picture.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
But the baffling part is that most prominences flow downward.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
Gases materializing from seemingly nowhere

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
and flowing down into sunspot areas for days at a time.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Coronal rain, it's sometimes called.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Where does it come from?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Of course, when it rains on Earth,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
we don't actually see the rain go up either.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
We only see it come down,

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
although we know it evaporates up from the seven seas.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
But where coronal rain comes from, we can only guess as yet.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Given the whopper, Doc,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
biggest solar explosion ever recorded

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
greatest photographic shot in history.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
On June 4th, 1946,

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
a great arch of gas hundreds of times as big as the Earth

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
rose up at a speed of 400,000 miles per hour.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
And the arch expanded clear out of rains

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
of the instruments at climax in less than an hour and a half.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
I remember that one.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Sure blew my top that day.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Yes, we heard you.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Roll 15.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
You heard me.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Oh, yes, we hear you every day.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
You not only send us light waves,

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
but you broadcast radio waves,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
which we're able to pick up quite clearly

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
at special radio astronomy stations,

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
which receive radio signals from outer space.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Here's a sample of the radio message you send us

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
on one of your noisier days.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
In Australia, they've recently done some brilliant work

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
with radio astronomy.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
Dr. E. G. Bowen heads the group of radio astronomers.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
It's only in the past few years

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
that we have discovered some strange things in the sky.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
Radio waves coming to us from many places in outer space.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
In Australia, they've recently done some brilliant work

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
with radio astronomy.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
Dr. E. G. Bowen heads the group of radio astronomers.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Radio astronomy is an outer space.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Radio astronomy is a brand new exciting tool for scientists,

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
and with it, we found out quite a bit about you, Mr. Sun,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
through the noises you make.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
I'm beginning to feel like a goldfish.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
You got him going, doctor.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
Well, doesn't all this spouting and erupting

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
have some effect on the Earth?

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Oh, yes, tremendous out of there.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Roll 8.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Well, for instance, when a large flare

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
flashes up around the Sunspot area,

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
it immediately sends out a burst of powerful ultraviolet rays

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
that hit the Earth in 8 minutes.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
But it also sprays streams of slower electrified fragments of atoms

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
out into spaces if from a hose.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
This solar spray of fine particles usually misses the Earth,

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
but at times the Earth is in its path.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Now, the Earth is a magnet with north and south magnetic poles

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
and a magnetic field around it.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
The spray of minute particles shot from the Sun,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
which takes some 30 hours to reach the Earth,

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
is deflected toward the poles by the Earth's magnetic field.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
As this solar dust, stardust, you might call it,

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
comes down into our atmosphere near the poles

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
and collides with air molecules,

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
it creates the most beautiful spectacle of the aurora,

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
also called the northern and southern lights.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
Dr. C.W. Gartline of Cornell University

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
took this unique time-lapse motion picture

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
of the actual aurora borealis.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
The Earth's rotation produces the apparent motion

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
of the stars in the background.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
But the effects of these ultraviolet bursts from the Sun

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
are not so beautiful.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
Voltage fluctuates, radio communications are disturbed,

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
and although our radio engineers have performed near miracles

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
in protecting our radio waves from this solar sniping,

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
Dr. Rural 7C, sometimes this happens.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
We take you now to London for a direct report from Sam Johnson.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Come in, London.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
This is Sam Johnson.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
There's an air of tense expectancy here in London.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
This morning, the prime minister...

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
Will you stop playing with that radio?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I'm not even trusted.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
But then do something!

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
That was the momentous statement

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
the prime minister read to us this morning.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
And now, back to New York.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
What an engineer!

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Wasn't the shoe? No, it wasn't the shoe.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Let's recreate what actually happened

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
in terms of atmosphere and radio waves.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Radio waves normally move in a straight line,

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
but about 50 miles high in our atmosphere,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
there isn't a lot of light.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
But about 50 miles high in our atmosphere,

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
there's an electrified layer called the ionosphere

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
that reflects radio waves,

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
making it possible to bounce them around the Earth.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Now let's listen to Sam Johnson again.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
This is Sam Johnson.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
There's an air of tense expectancy here in London.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Suddenly a bright flare occurs on the sun.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
First, the ultraviolet rays disrupts the ionosphere.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
This morning, the prime minister announced...

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
But radio engineers are right on the ball.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
Bill, London's folding. Another SID, eh?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Yep.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I've got another frequency ready for you.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Not yet. Wait a minute.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
An SID means a sudden ionospheric disturbance,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
which is unpredictable.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
But usually, in a matter of minutes,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
the ionospheric layer reforms again.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
And that was the momentous statement

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
the prime minister read to us this morning.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
And now, back to New York.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
But when big regions of the sun are intensely active,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
the spray of solar particles that causes the aurora

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
can disturb communications for hours, even days.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
But this type is predictable.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
Oh, yes. Fortunately, it usually is.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
And since radio communication is so vital to the services,

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
airlines, radio stations, telephone companies,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
ships at sea,

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
recently observatories all over the world

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
have begun to keep watch on the sun

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
and make up a worldwide radio warning service

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
at the High Altitude Observatory at Climax, Colorado,

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
at the Air Force Observatory at Sacramento Peak,

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
at Kota Canal, India,

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
in Japan,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
in stations all over the globe,

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
observers keep tabs on you, Mr. Sun,

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
and send in information to the Central Collecting Agencies,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
such as the Radio Storm Warning Service

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
of the National Bureau of Standards,

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
where men under Alan Shapley analyze the data

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
and try to predict when the solar storm

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
strikes the Earth, especially the vital

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
North Atlantic communication lines.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
Then, by radio, by teletype, by phone,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
the warning goes out.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
Severe magnetic storm will affect North Atlantic circuits.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
Lower frequencies or use southern roots.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
That's fine.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
But, Dr. Research,

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
what has puzzled you scientists most about the sun?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Roll nine.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
Even I can give you that in one word.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Energy.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
This lady's parasol has one-and-one-half horsepower

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
of sunshine continually poured on it.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Enough to run her washing machine, sewing machine,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
refrigerator, and vacuum cleaner.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
In full sunlight, our family car receives

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
almost enough sun power to run it,

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
if we only knew how to use solar energy directly.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
At the common rate of two cents per kilowatt hour,

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
the sun sends the Earth $1 billion worth of energy

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
every second, and it's coming to us free.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Five minutes' worth would pay our national debt.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
One minute's worth of the energy that hits the Earth

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
would pay the total annual income tax

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
of all United States citizens.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
Oh, happy day.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Yet what the Earth receives

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
is only a minute fraction of the whole,

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
only one part and two billion of the total solar energy.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
The rest of the $500,000 billion-billion horsepower

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
goes out into space.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
How does the sun generate this enormous amount of power,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Dr. Research?

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
Yes, I don't eat, drink, or take vitamins.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I never sleep or rest.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Then how do I do it, brother scientist?

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
Well, we know at least part of your secret now.

27:46.000 --> 28:10.000
MUSIC

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
We know the answer not only to your energy,

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
but to what makes other stars in the universe shine.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
Thermonuclear reaction.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
It's the key word that wound up the universe.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Thermonuclear.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
Eight to five, they've made a hydrogen bomb.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
We certainly have, Mr. Sun.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
And the news rocked the world.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
But with you, it's old stuff.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
The equivalent of four billion hydrogen bombs

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
have been going off inside you every second

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
for some four billion years.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
Give or take a billion.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
MUSIC

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
What smart guy figured that out?

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
Dr. Hans Bethe of Cornell is the gentleman.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
In 1938, he announced that the source of the sun's energy

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
is the fusion of 564 million tons of hydrogen

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
into 560 million tons of helium each second.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
564 to 560, where did the missing 4 million tons go?

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Just disappear?

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
Disappears as mass, as matter,

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
but reappears as light, heat, and all sorts of radiation.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
Quite a trickster, old Sol, making 4 million tons disappear.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
4 million tons?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
That he is.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
Roll 12.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
I brought along a trickster friend of mine,

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
Thermo the magician, who has an act which he claims

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
explains the sun's magic.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
I am Thermo.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
I will do for you such a trick.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Only me and the stars can do.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Pay attention.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
This is one way to make a hydrogen bomb.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Nature's way.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
So, hydrogen.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
One, two, three, four.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
What is hydrogen?

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
The smallest atom from which you build all the other atoms.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
So, we will weigh the hydrogen.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Scale.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
Each bottle weighs exactly 100 ounces.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
For bottles, 400 ounces.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Remember that.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
400 ounces.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
So, now, carbon.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
This is carbon.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
A piece of coal for you.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
That is what I start with.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Hydrogen and carbon.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
So, now I will heat them.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
30 million degrees, I will heat them.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
How?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Hydrogen bomb.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
It is done by exploding an ordinary atom bomb

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
to ignite the hydrogen bomb.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
But the stars, they do it by pressure.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
Gravity.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Like our Mr. Sun.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
So, now I play Mr. Sun and heat the hydrogen

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
and the carbon to 30 million degrees.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Fire.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Fire.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Fire.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Fire.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Now I am ready.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
One hydrogen, come.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
I thermal now give the command.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
Fusion.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
So, what have we here?

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Nitrogen.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
The gas what makes four-fifths of the air you breathe.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Air.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
Now, number two and number three hydrogen,

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
come.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
Fusion.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Now we have oxygen.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Another-fifth of the air you breathe.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Number four.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Fusion.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Huh?

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Now we have coal again.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Same piece.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
And we have helium.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
What you feel ballooned with.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Four hydrogens, if they are 30 million degrees hot,

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
30 million degrees.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
It is not children playing with matches.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
The four hydrogens come out one helium.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
The carbon comes back the same.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
You see, same way, no change.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
That's why we call this the carbon cycle.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Now we weigh the helium.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
Should weigh 400 ounces like the hydrogen.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Oh yes, naturally.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
But it can be.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
The helium weighs three ounces less than the hydrogen.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
Where did the three ounces go?

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
That is the magic of the stars.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
That is the secret of the hydrogen bomb.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
I show you.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
Come back three ounces.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Here is where they went.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
They changed into...

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Now the energy in those three little ounces

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
that completely disappeared as matter,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
that energy is enough to raise

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
the Empire State Building 2,500 miles high.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
Now the carbon cycle, which is what Thermo just explained to us,

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
is not the only way in which you can change hydrogen

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
into helium plus energy.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
You may also use a very special and rare process

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
in which you put two hydrogen atoms together directly.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
Is that the famous proton-proton process?

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
See, you've been reading.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
Mr. Son, you do not annihilate or destroy

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
just two or three ounces.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
But four million tons of hydrogen matter each second.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
That gives you your unbelievable energy,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
which you radiate out into space.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
We think that originally,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
you were a great loose cloud of gas,

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
mostly hydrogen, being contracted by gravity.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
As you were compressed, the temperature went up.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Just as the air in a bicycle tire gets hotter and hotter

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
as you pump it.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Finally, the temperature in your core

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
reached the necessary 30 million degrees

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
needed to trigger the thermonuclear reaction.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Presto, the furnace was lit.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
Never to go out again as long as you live, Mr. Son.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
The hydrogen began burning into helium and energy.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Gravity tries to compress you.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
Burning hydrogen tries to expand you.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
The two forces just balance each other.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
What's perfection itself?

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
A furnace made of its own fuel.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
An immense, continuous hydrogen bomb

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
operating at an even heat for billions of years.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
What a wonderful invention you are, Mr. Son.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Which brings up a point.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
How long before he runs out of this here now, hydrogen fuel?

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
Oh, he still has about 98% of his fuel left.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
But 50, 100 billion years from now, Mr. Son,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
you'll perhaps run out of fuel.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
You'll expire, go wherever good stars go.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
We'll go with you because as you go, we go.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
You see, you're not just a big blob of hot mass to us.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
You're the head of our family.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
We want to know more about you.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
We depend on you for our very existence.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Yes, in fact, we're depending on you heavily

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
for the solution of two of man's biggest problems.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
Well, at last I'm being appreciated.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
What did you say your name was?

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
Dr. Research, your big...

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
What are those two big problems you spoke of, Dr. Research?

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
The first is the age-old problem of food.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Roll five.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
And boy, the number of miles that need food keeps increasing.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
In 1650, after 25,000 years of man,

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
our population had reached half a billion.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
By 1950, only 300 years later,

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
the population climbed to two and one half billion,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
five times as many.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Out of all human beings who ever lived,

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
one out of 20 is alive today.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
One out of 20? Alive today?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Isn't that amazing?

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
We never had food enough for all in the past.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
We don't have enough for all today.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
Two out of every three persons on Earth

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
naturally eat below the minimum necessary for health.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
Yet 100 million new babies are born every year.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
A yearly baby crop nearly equal to the population

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
of all of South America.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
And all born hungry.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
Yes, our population's practically exploding.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
I bet he doesn't know who grows his food for him.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Oh, yeah, we know quite a bit about that.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
That is he does.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
Roll four.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
Our food is grown by a natural process called photosynthesis,

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
which means putting together with light, your light,

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
the oldest, biggest and most important manufacturing operation in the world.

36:29.000 --> 36:34.000
99% of all our food and fuel is created by photosynthesis,

36:34.000 --> 36:39.000
a process that goes on only in plants, never in animals.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
On every green leaf, there are millions of

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
sub-microscopic little one-man factories

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
turning out more sugar than all the ships and railroads in the world could carry.

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
And the head man of each factory is a little green molecule called chlorophyll,

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
the only engineer with a know-how about this still secret life process.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
Chlorophyll is so small and so secretive

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
that not even the most powerful microscopes can spy on him.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Here's the way we think he works.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
The veins of the leaf bring him water from the roots.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
From the air, he grabs a molecule of carbon dioxide, CO2.

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
He puts a water molecule and a carbon dioxide molecule together.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
Then he reaches for a piece of sunlight,

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
and this is what we don't quite know how he adds this sunlight.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
And I'm not going to tell you either.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
You can darn well find out for yourself.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Quiet.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
Piece by piece, he adds more sunlight to his sugarcane.

37:40.000 --> 37:45.000
Then he pulls out an oxygen atom from the mixture and releases it into the air.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
And the Russians didn't invent me either.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
I invented myself.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
Then he takes some sauce that come up in the veins,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
sprinkles them over the mixture for icing,

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
and puts the completed sugar cake into a waiting artery.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
Out of this sugar or sunshine cake,

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
the tree makes leaves, trunk, roots, and fruit.

38:07.000 --> 38:12.000
In the sea, chlorophyll produces even more food than he does on land.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
The whole surface of the seas is teeming with billions of tons of a minute,

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
single-cell vegetable called phytoplankton.

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
These in turn are eaten by countless, almost invisible little animals called zooplankton.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Which are eaten by little fish.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Which are eaten by bigger fish.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Which are eaten by still bigger fish.

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
Yes, all fish are ultimately made of chlorophyll sunshine cake.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
And when we catch them and can them, we're catching and canning sunlight.

38:52.000 --> 38:57.000
In fact, all animals feed on sunshine cake in one form or another.

39:04.000 --> 39:09.000
The energy the junior gets from milk was in a contented cow 24 hours ago.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
24 hours before that, the same energy was in clover,

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
which had absorbed it from sunlight that had come 93 million miles in eight minutes

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
from the surface of the sun,

39:19.000 --> 39:25.000
but had taken 20 million years to find its way to the surface from the sun's central furnace.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
So you see the energy that makes junior run,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
that makes a porpoise leap,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
and makes me talk so much.

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
That energy is hydrogen that burned in your central furnace

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
long, long before man walked the earth.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
You know, brother research, I'm beginning to like you.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
Do all the people know these things about me?

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
No, that's why this program.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
What's the big hitch in the food problem?

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
For one thing, chlorophyll is too slow.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Take any acre of forest or vegetables.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
The amount of sunshine converted to plant food

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
averages only two tons of vegetable matter per year.

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
But if all the lights you send us could be used by chlorophyll,

40:07.000 --> 40:11.000
we could raise 2,000 tons of food per acre per year.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
A little chlorophyll may know the big secret, but he's awfully inefficient.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Oh, who's inefficient?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
I just make sugar.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
Can I help it? It's so silly. Please build a trunk soon.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
Branches and roots out of it, but you can't eat.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
What you're looking for is a plant that's all fruit.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Oh, there is such a plant.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Oh, edible, too.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
And it multiplies faster than rabbits.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
But you scientists are too dumb to find it.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
There you are, Mr. Man. Find the plant.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Oh, we found it already, Mr. Son.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Roll ten.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Found it in freshwater lakes.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
A kind of green algae called chlorella,

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
a tiny one-celled plant that has learned the mathematical trick

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
of multiplying by dividing.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
Each cell gives birth to from four to 16 daughter cells,

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
which all grow up and repeat the process.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
Chlorella contains fats, carbohydrates, and up to 50% proteins,

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
and is all edible.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
All fruit is, Mr. Chlorell would say.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
All over the world, scientists are doing research on chlorella.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
In Japan, Dr. Hiroshi Tamia of the Tokugawa Institute

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
has done some of the most interesting and practical work.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
For there, food is definitely a problem.

41:29.000 --> 41:34.000
Into these troughs, water containing chlorella cultures is pumped.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Nutrient salts are added.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
The troughs are covered with plastic sheeting to let in sunlight

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
while extra carbon dioxide is bubbled into the solution.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
When the culture becomes intensely green,

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
the chlorella crop is harvested.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
After washing and drying, the fine powder looks like green flour.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
Mrs. Tamia, wife of the director, has added this to regular flour

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
and made excellent biscuits and cakes out of it.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
If these processes ever become practical,

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
underfed populations may have a new, rich source of food.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Yes, indeed.

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
An acre of chlorella can convert sunlight into some 20 tons of plant matter

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
against one or two tons of an ordinary crop.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
But there's a second great problem facing us eventually.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
For thousands of years, we got our fuel from burning wood.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
Sun power, Mr. Sun stored up in trees.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Next, we put animals to work.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Sun power from grass.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
Then came educated power to do work animals couldn't be taught to do.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
Human slave power to build roads, pyramids and row ships.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Sun power with brains.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
But slaves had to be fed.

42:51.000 --> 42:56.000
So we discovered power that didn't eat, like windmills and water wheels.

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
The machine age was born.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
But modern machines need to be fed too, fed with fuels.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Where do we get the fuels?

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
From the big fuel man himself.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
Over the ages, Mr. Sun was kind enough to store them up for him.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Chomp for living sunshine.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Thing for fossil sunshine.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Drill for liquid sunshine.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Dams for silent sunshine.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Fuel.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Fuel.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
More fuel.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
How much fuel is in the bank?

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
How big is the trust fund the old boy left us?

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Roll 13.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
Well, suppose all our energy had been deposited

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
in the Sun power bank incorporated,

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
founded millions of years ago with assets unlimited.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
In 1850, each American for instance,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
withdrew enough fuel from the fuel bank

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
to generate 400 horsepower hours for himself.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
But nobody worried too much about it.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Our assets still appeared unlimited.

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
In 1950, each American withdrew 10,000 horsepower hours

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
from Sun power incorporated,

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
while atomic scientists were making some minor deposits.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
This began to worry us.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
Our assets were becoming definitely limited.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
By 1975, we'll probably be able to do something

44:28.000 --> 44:34.000
but by 1975, we'll probably withdraw 20,000 horsepower hours each.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
Atomic energy fuel deposits will stave off the run for some time,

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
but there's only so much uranium and thorium in the world,

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
and that will go too.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
When the principal's gone, you're going to have to live on your income, huh?

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
But our income is only about 10% of our power spending.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
We need help.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
Every day I send you a thousand times more power

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
than you use in a year.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
It's up to you, fellows.

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
Anybody working on getting power direct from old blowhard here?

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Oh, yes, but not nearly enough.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
Roll six feet.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
Some years ago, Dr. Charles Greeley Abbott,

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
an enthusiastic pioneer in solar engines,

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
designed this vacuum-jacketed boiler tube

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
at the focus of a parabolic mirror,

45:16.000 --> 45:21.000
which will convert sunlight to engine power.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
Today, the French laboratory of solar energy

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
has an enormous solar furnace at Mont Louis

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
for metal research at high temperatures.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
In India, Dr. S. Batnagar,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
the famous Indian scientist,

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
experimented with solar cookers for home use.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
On one of these cookers,

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
an Indian family can cook its noonday meal

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
with no heat other than the sun's heat.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
Some other ways depend on glass.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Sunlight coming through a window,

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
heats up everything in the room,

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
but heat radiated back from furniture and floor

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
is long heat waves,

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
which the window glass stops from going back out,

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
thus trapping the sun's heat.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Is that why greenhouses covered with glass

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
are warmer inside than the air outside?

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Right.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
That's why your closed car gets so unbearably hot

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
standing out in the sun.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
Dr. Maria Telkis has designed a model house in Massachusetts

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
in which solar heat is ingeniously collected,

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
stored, and distributed throughout the whole house.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
Now, these are more or less well-known mechanical ways

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
of using sun power directly.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
There's exciting research going on with some brand new ways.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
You think Mr. Clarifill was pretty smart

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
with his tricky sunshine cake

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
that makes food out of your sunlight?

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Well, the science boys have come up with a sunshine cake

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
that makes electricity out of your sunlight.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Oh, yes. You mean the solar battery?

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
That's hardly even a cookie yet, let alone a cake.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Doc, that's big news.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Well, it was the solar battery.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
Now, held in the sun, this thin little cell,

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
a sunshine wafer we might call it,

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
produces a usable amount of electric current

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
out of the sunlight that falls on it.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
It was cooked up out of basic research

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
at the Bell Telephone Lab by three scientists,

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
Darrell Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
You know, although this is quite expensive at the moment,

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
the simplicity of this sunshine wafer is startling.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
What bake one for a glory, Puss Doc?

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
I'd be delighted.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
Look at him. Oh, pastry cook research.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
The recipe for this solar wafer

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
sounds just like a vacation.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Just sand and sunshine.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Thank you, son.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Ah!

47:38.000 --> 47:43.000
Plain old sand is composed of silicon and oxygen.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
It's time to go to meeting name as silicon dioxide.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
Separate out the oxygen and the bits of seaweed,

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
bottle tops, and other odds and ends.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
And we have left a metal silicon.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
Ah, but our silicon must be pure silicon.

47:59.000 --> 48:05.000
So we purify it, and purify it until it's as pure as the driven snow.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Now melt the silicon,

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
and add just a pinch of arsenic for flavor.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Mix thoroughly.

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
Then cool until it crystallizes.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
Then from the arsenic flavored silicon roll,

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
slice off a razor thin wafer.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Put the wafer into the oven.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
Fill oven with a boron gas,

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
and bake the white heat.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
The boron cooks into the surface, forms an extremely thin icing over the wafer.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Remove finished wafer.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
Connect one wire from electric motor to boron icing,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
and the other wire to the wafer itself.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Expose wafer to sunlight.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Presto!

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
The motor starts running with the efficiency of an automobile,

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
and nothing is used up but the sunshine, which is free.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
Is that something?

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
Well, I'll be darned.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
So you see in a solar battery,

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
it's energy from the sun that moves the electricity,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
which in turn rotates motors.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
It's energy from the sun that moves the electricity.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
It's energy from the sun that moves the electricity.

49:15.000 --> 49:19.000
It's energy from the sun that moves the electricity.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
It's energy from the sun that moves the electricity.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Or as in this case,

49:24.000 --> 49:30.000
powers rural telephone lines by charging storage batteries.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
But the solar battery isn't all.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
There's other important research in changing sunlight into power.

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
Dr. E. I. Rabinowitz has put together a chemical cell

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
that'll change light waves into electric current.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
But storing sun power for night use

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
is a big part of this energy from the sun problem.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
Well, Dr. Lawrence J. Height of MIT

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
is experimenting with a process

49:54.000 --> 49:59.000
in which sunlight decomposes water back into oxygen and hydrogen,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
the hydrogen being a storable fuel.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Another possibility.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
Phosphors are chemical powders that absorb sunlight

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
and can give it back slowly in the dark.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
I read where Westinghouse engineers predict a wallpaper

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
containing phosphors which will absorb daylight during the day,

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
then glow for hours after dark.

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
A city painted with phosphor paint of the future might glow all night.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
These are some of the processes

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
that are being researched on a small scale today, Mr. Sun.

50:27.000 --> 50:32.000
But our engineers can't turn the wheels of industry on little wafers.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
They'll have to build efficient generators

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
that spread out over acres, even square miles,

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
to compete with the cheap, cold, and oil still available to us.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
And the doctor, what about atomic power?

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Oh, great hopes for it, of course.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
Especially now, since atomic plants can make their own fuel

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
with so-called breeder reactors.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
Some even dream of imitating the stars,

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
getting power from hydrogen fusion.

50:56.000 --> 51:01.000
But if dreams fail, the answer must be sun power from our Mr. Sun.

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
What if you don't find ways to use my free sunshine for fuel?

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
Then the machine age is over.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
We'll have to go back to muscle power

51:14.000 --> 51:19.000
and the half-billion population that muscle power alone can support.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
But that will never happen.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Oh, no, why not?

51:31.000 --> 51:36.000
Because man's greatest power source is his mind.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
God gave him that, not you.

51:39.000 --> 51:45.000
Without taking a step, he can travel faster and farther than any animal.

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
Without even getting wet, he can out-swim any fish.

51:49.000 --> 51:54.000
Without a fell on him, he can fly faster and higher

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
and farther than any eagle.

52:00.000 --> 52:05.000
He can send his eyes and ears hundreds of miles into space

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
where he's never even been.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
And his pride opened the secret of the atom,

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
which he's never even seen.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
When his fuel's run low,

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
man's mind and imagination will meet the challenge

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
and invent undreamed of ways to use the free sunlight

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
God showers down upon him.

52:31.000 --> 52:37.000
Just remember, somebody must love you very much.

52:37.000 --> 52:42.000
That planet that you live on is not like all the rest.

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
You're blessed with just the right size,

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
the right temperature, the right atmosphere,

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
the right composition.

52:52.000 --> 52:57.000
Everything just right to produce the biggest miracle of all.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Life.

53:01.000 --> 53:07.000
So go ahead, ask, inquire, seek the truth.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
It's right that you should know

53:09.000 --> 53:14.000
or the good Lord wouldn't have given you that driving curiosity.

53:14.000 --> 53:18.000
Measure the outside with mathematics,

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
but measure the inside with prayer.

53:21.000 --> 53:27.000
Prayer is researched to study man as well as the world.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
So keep on pitching.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
The best is yet to come for you.

53:32.000 --> 53:38.000
I predict man's next great adventure will be the sun age.

53:38.000 --> 53:43.000
When that happens, you'll be rich beyond all dreams.

53:43.000 --> 53:48.000
I predict great sun cities built on desert wastelands

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
where everything is run by sunlight.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I predict...

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Oh, sure, that's fine.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
But suppose I begin cutting up, then what?

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
You won't.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
But if you did, man has migrated many times before

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
and he'll do it again if he has to.

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
If you make it too hot for him on Earth,

54:11.000 --> 54:15.000
man is capable of conceiving a way to move the whole kitten

54:15.000 --> 54:20.000
to bootle the greener pastures on some other planet.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Oh, no, we like it here.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Don't change on us, Mr. Sun.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
We used to worship you as an unknown god.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
But now that we know you better,

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
we love you as our great and good friend.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
So keep on shining, Mr. Sun.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
Thanks for all the radiant riches you showered down upon us.

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
Thanks for our eyes and all the glories we behold.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
Thanks for all the green forests,

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
the great deposit of black dimes,

54:57.000 --> 55:02.000
the deep pools of liquid gold you put in the bank for us.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Thanks for the wheat fields,

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
all the fruits and flowers you grow for us.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
Thanks for feeding our animals,

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
our birds, our insects,

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
all the fish in the sea.

55:15.000 --> 55:20.000
And thanks especially for the glory and beauty of your good mornings

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
and your good evenings

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
and the words of St. Francis.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
Be praised, my Lord, in what you have created.

55:28.000 --> 55:33.000
Above all else, be praised in our brother, Master Sun.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Good night, brotherhood.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
Now you're hooking the sunshine.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
The Bell Telephone System takes pride in bringing you this program

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
in its series of shows on science.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
We wish to express our gratitude

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
to the distinguished board of advisors

56:16.000 --> 56:21.000
who guide the choice and treatment of scientific matter for the series.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
For the program you have just seen,

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
our thanks to the special advisors

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
who have suggested and checked the scientific material.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
The Bell Telephone System is indebted to all these men

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
and to many institutions

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
for the generous support they have given this venture

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
in public education through entertainment.
