0	8000	The Bell Telephone System brings you one of a series of programs on science to understand nature's laws.
30000	39000	The Bell Telephone System brings you one of a series of programs on science to understand nature's laws.
39000	41000	Let's try that focus again, Jim.
41000	42000	Coming up.
42000	43000	The title's okay.
43000	45000	Now let's test that first animation.
45000	48000	Roll two.
48000	49000	Okay, hold it.
49000	51000	Now sharpen the focus.
51000	52000	Right.
52000	53000	Hold roll two.
53000	56000	Doctor, how is the son born?
56000	58000	Don't know exactly.
58000	60000	You're a scientist and you don't know?
60000	65000	Could use my imagination, but you're the fiction writer.
65000	67000	Imagination?
67000	70000	Well, we could ask Mr. Sun himself.
70000	74000	Yes, if we had a magic wand.
74000	75000	Sure, sure.
75000	76000	You've got it.
76000	77000	Magic.
77000	79000	Your science and my magic.
79000	83000	We'll open up our story of our Mr. Sun with a little fantasy.
83000	84000	You know, showmanship.
84000	85000	Go back into time.
85000	87000	Show the birth of the sun out of time, stardust.
87000	89000	Here, we'll turn back the clock.
89000	91000	Oh, that'll only take you back 12 hours.
91000	92000	Oh.
92000	94000	All right.
94000	99000	We'll open up the curtain of our imagination.
99000	100000	This'll be our magic screen.
100000	102000	Yours will be just for facts.
102000	104000	We'll pull back the curtains of our magic screen.
104000	107000	We'll dream up a clock.
107000	112000	There you are.
112000	117000	A clock that's been ticking since time began.
117000	124000	Our solar system wound up by Father Time himself.
124000	126000	Do you see what I'm seeing?
126000	128000	Well, certainly.
128000	131000	Maybe I could talk to him, huh?
131000	134000	Hey, Father Time, how long has that sun clock been going?
134000	136000	A few billion years.
136000	137000	Why?
137000	140000	Well, could you unwind it for us?
140000	142000	Unwind time?
142000	144000	Man, are you crazy?
144000	146000	Well, I'm a fiction writer.
146000	148000	We're auditioning a show about our Mr. Sun,
148000	149000	and I thought that...
149000	151000	Show about me?
151000	154000	Well, well, about time.
154000	156000	Look who's here.
156000	157000	Hi.
157000	160000	Yeah, we were wondering how it all happened at the beginning.
160000	163000	Nobody knows what happened at the beginning.
163000	164000	Oh, come on.
164000	166000	Pop, unwind us.
166000	168000	They want to see how I was born.
168000	171000	You... you old hot gas bag.
171000	172000	You keep still.
172000	175000	Now, don't flip your sickle, Pop.
175000	177000	The man says it's just a show.
177000	179000	He's a romantic fool.
179000	182000	If you want facts, ask your scientists.
182000	185000	Oh, we've got doctor research here for facts.
185000	188000	But what I need right now is something to open this thing up with a bang.
188000	190000	You know what I mean?
190000	191000	Certainly.
191000	195000	My story should be colorful, romantic, not just facts.
195000	197000	Here, I'll tell you how it should open.
197000	198000	Wait a minute.
198000	199000	I'm telling this story.
199000	201000	You're just imaginary.
201000	202000	Quiet.
202000	204000	You want a show, don't you?
204000	206000	Go on.
208000	210000	Yes, sir?
210000	212000	Set the stage for me.
212000	214000	Oh, yes, sir.
216000	217000	Uh-uh.
217000	219000	You had an Academy Award, really.
219000	221000	Hey, he's taking over.
221000	222000	How do you like that?
222000	223000	I like it.
223000	226000	Let him go on.
226000	228000	Music.
231000	232000	Lights.
234000	235000	Color.
237000	241000	And here, Mr. Sun from the East.
251000	253000	Good morning, Brother Earth.
253000	255000	For the empty billionth time.
255000	257000	Good morning.
257000	259000	Good morning, Brother Bird.
259000	261000	Brother Mountain.
261000	263000	Brother Sea.
263000	265000	Morning to you, Brother Gal.
265000	267000	Brother Bee.
267000	269000	Brother Fish.
269000	271000	Good morning, all of you.
273000	275000	Great day.
279000	281000	Every day's a great day.
283000	286000	You know me as the sun.
286000	290000	Of course, what I really am is a star.
290000	293000	An average, everyday type of star.
293000	295000	Billions like me.
296000	299000	I remember when Primitive Man first began to look up
299000	302000	to gaze in wonderment at the stars and planets
302000	305000	sweeping across the face of the sky.
305000	309000	That primitive curiosity was the beginning of all your science.
309000	312000	Of course, they had some pretty odd notions about me.
312000	314000	Some thought I was an enormous beetle
314000	317000	crumbling a fiery ball across the heavens.
317000	319000	The ancient Eskimos thought I was a little man
319000	322000	wearing thick furs to keep myself warm.
322000	325000	But to most, I was a god.
326000	328000	Fancy names and wardrobes.
328000	331000	In Babylon, I was Shamash.
331000	334000	And my sun temples were observatories.
334000	337000	In Persia, I was Mithras.
337000	341000	And to ancient Egypt, I was the great god Rah.
342000	345000	Glory to the great sun god.
345000	351000	Hold our perfect, our eternal, our only one.
352000	355000	Blame me for getting the swell head.
355000	359000	Ah, but the name I like best was Phoebus Apollo.
359000	361000	The Greeks always didn't have a word for it.
361000	364000	In my case, it was handsome.
364000	368000	Apollo racing across the sky in his fiery chariot
368000	372000	making heavenly music on his golden ukulele.
372000	374000	Oh, that was for me.
374000	376000	I loved it.
376000	379000	And then along came another Greek to spoil it all.
379000	383000	A Greek who would rather think than worship sun gods.
383000	385000	Anaxagoras was his name.
385000	388000	The sun is not a god or a person.
388000	391000	It is a mass of red hot stone,
391000	395000	only 40 miles across and 4,000 miles away.
395000	398000	For blaspheming against the beautiful Apollo,
398000	401000	Anaxagoras was banished from Athens.
401000	404000	And I wasn't a bit sorry for him.
404000	409000	But man had fallen for this new and fascinating mistress, his brain.
409000	411000	Thinking began spreading like the measles.
411000	413000	Everybody got the bug.
413000	416000	The Greeks with their logic and philosophy.
416000	420000	The Hindus with their algebra and your present number system.
420000	423000	The Arabs with their early instruments like the astrolabe.
423000	428000	And today instead of temples, rituals and hymns to the sun,
428000	432000	it's domes, gadgets, charts and numbers.
432000	436000	I'm demoted to a specimen, a pile of facts and figures.
436000	442000	A big blob of mass holding little blobs of mass together with gravity.
442000	446000	Instead of with love, I think you're all through.
446000	448000	Who's all through?
448000	450000	Earthman. He's had it.
450000	454000	Why you flaming idiot, I haven't even started yet.
454000	458000	In worshiping me, ancient man was reaching for the great light beyond.
458000	462000	But modern man, he's got all the answers.
462000	466000	Mr. Sun, you mind if I butt in a moment?
466000	468000	Who are you?
468000	471000	Who me? Oh, I'm the...
471000	475000	Never mind. Thank you very much. Goodbye.
475000	478000	Would you mind if we listened in?
478000	482000	See here, you're not even real. I just made you up. You go wind your clock.
482000	487000	No, let them stay. I like your magic. Father Time, my name's Research.
487000	489000	Who?
489000	491000	A scientist.
491000	493000	Hmm.
493000	496000	Howdy, Doctor Research.
496000	500000	I'd like to hear what you have to say about Golden Boy here.
500000	506000	Well, it's a delightful experience talking directly to you and to Mr. Sun, especially for a scientist.
506000	509000	I was just going to relate a few facts about Mr. Sun.
509000	515000	Facts? If you're going to tell my story, don't give the people equations and figures.
515000	519000	Give them the real old doubt. Tell them what I mean to them.
519000	526000	They've forgotten that. When they eat corn or bread or grapes or meat, they're eating sunlight.
526000	530000	Their houses, furniture, cars, they're nylons.
530000	534000	Yes, even their moonshine is sunshine.
534000	539000	Tell them if it wasn't for me, they'd have no eyes, because there'd be nothing to see.
539000	542000	That's enough. You're getting purple.
542000	547000	Why, if I put my light out, every living thing on Earth would be frozen stiff.
547000	553000	And you scientists who know would be just as cold and stiff as the people that don't know.
553000	555000	Through blowing sunspots?
555000	557000	Yes.
557000	560000	Then apologize to Doctor Research.
561000	565000	Well, I'm sorry, Brother Research.
565000	569000	No apology necessary. Mr. Sun is almost right.
569000	570000	Almost?
570000	574000	Yes. Mr. Sun, your logic is a little on the romantic side, too.
574000	578000	You say that you don't like facts, and yet you've just given us quite a list of them.
578000	582000	This may turn out to be fun.
582000	585000	No, Mr. Sun, we haven't got all the answers.
585000	589000	Science has just opened the book, yet in seeking for more knowledge,
589000	593000	we, too, in a way, are reaching for the great light beyond.
593000	596000	Doctor, that's it. That's it.
596000	598000	What's it? The gimmick.
598000	601000	Come into my office here.
601000	602000	We put the show on for him.
602000	603000	For the Sun?
603000	605000	Sure. It's a tough audience.
605000	607000	Science shows Sun were not all through, you get it?
607000	609000	Could be boring to him.
609000	611000	Could be.
611000	613000	You keep your corona on.
613000	616000	Science has found out about you as more exciting than any fiction.
616000	617000	You stick around, you'll see.
617000	619000	What we really don't know very much about him.
619000	620000	Oh, we know plenty about him.
620000	621000	What about the television people?
621000	622000	Never mind him.
622000	624000	Just think, we've got a real show here.
624000	625000	Well, you remember where you come in.
625000	627000	I remember the weather, the fuel, the entertainment.
627000	628000	And you cut in on me if I get stuff in.
628000	629000	I'll cut in on you, but come on.
629000	630000	Roll him, roll him.
630000	632000	Roll to.
632000	634000	Here we go.
634000	638000	Although Mr. Sun is 93 million miles away,
638000	641000	and it takes his life eight minutes to reach us,
641000	643000	we're pretty close.
643000	645000	The light from the next nearest star,
645000	649000	traveling at 186,000 miles per second,
649000	652000	takes over four years to get to us.
652000	654000	We know Mr. Sun is so large,
654000	657000	our Earth is barely visible alongside him.
657000	662000	It would take some 340 worlds, like beads on a string,
662000	665000	to make a necklace around his shining sphere.
665000	668000	How much does Mr. Sun weigh?
668000	671000	1,000 worlds?
671000	673000	100,000?
673000	675000	No, sir.
675000	680000	He weighs as much as 330,000 Mother Earths.
680000	683000	We also know that Mr. Sun is not solid or liquid,
683000	686000	but a fiery ball of hot, glowing gases,
686000	689000	consisting of some 95% hydrogen and helium,
689000	692000	and a few percent all other elements.
692000	695000	We know that this huge cloud of hot gases
695000	698000	would expand, float away, dissipate into space,
698000	702000	unless gravity squeezed it together into a tight sphere.
702000	706000	The gases at the center of the Sun are so densely packed by gravity
706000	709000	that they're about 100 times heavier than water.
709000	713000	And the pressure is around 1 billion tons to the square inch.
713000	716000	While at the surface, the gases are so thin,
716000	720000	the pressure is only about one pound to the square inch.
720000	723000	We know too that the temperature at the core of the Sun
723000	727000	is incredibly hot, around 30 million degrees Fahrenheit.
727000	731000	While at the surface, it drops down to just about 10,000 degrees.
731000	733000	But here's a strange thing.
733000	735000	As we go out from the Sun into the corona,
735000	737000	the temperature goes up again
737000	741000	to over 1 million degrees at the outer edges.
741000	743000	Tell them why, Dr. Research.
743000	745000	We don't know why.
745000	748000	You don't? Well, what is the corona anyway?
748000	750000	We don't actually know that yet.
750000	752000	But we do know there's more to Mr. Sun
752000	754000	than the shining surface we normally see,
754000	757000	which we call a photosphere or sphere of light.
757000	761000	Only when the moon moves between us and the Sun
761000	764000	and covers the photosphere completely in a total eclipse
764000	767000	can we see the rest of Mr. Sun's thin atmosphere,
767000	770000	the beautiful and mysterious corona.
770000	773000	For many, many years, scientists have lugged their instruments
773000	776000	to all parts of the globe chasing eclipses.
780000	789000	Music
789000	791000	Expedition spending months,
791000	794000	just for a two or three-minute opportunity to see,
794000	799000	measure, and photograph the eclipsed Sun.
799000	803000	Sometimes heavy clouds, failure, complete washout.
803000	807000	Sometimes light clouds, measurements uncertain.
807000	810000	But on happy occasions, perfect conditions.
810000	813000	The corona is studied and photographed
813000	815000	in the fullness of its glory.
815000	819000	Music
819000	822000	Your corona is most puzzling to us, Mr. Sun.
822000	825000	We know that it rotates with you,
825000	828000	but at no two eclipses does it look just the same.
828000	830000	It pulsates, changes shape,
830000	833000	and at times extends out millions of miles.
833000	835000	Why is that?
835000	838000	Just one of the many things we still don't know about the Sun.
838000	842000	Look, have we better tell him something we do know?
842000	844000	Want to hear any more, Mr. Sun?
844000	846000	I like your pictures of me.
846000	848000	Got any more?
848000	849000	Oh, yes, lots.
849000	850000	Roll six.
850000	853000	The camera's one of our main tools.
853000	856000	Now, here's a normal picture of you taken by direct sunlight.
856000	857000	It's rather flat.
857000	859000	Your face has little expression.
859000	861000	But about 60 years ago,
861000	863000	Dr. George Ellery Hale of America
863000	866000	and Dr. Henri Delant of France
866000	868000	conceived this ingenious instrument
868000	870000	called the spectrogeliograph.
870000	872000	It filters out all the light waves,
872000	875000	except the light from some particular glowing atom,
875000	877000	as for instance, hydrogen.
877000	881000	Let's look at a normal white light picture of the Sun again.
881000	884000	Now, here, taken at the same time,
884000	887000	is a spectrogeliogram that photographed
887000	890000	only the red light from glowing hydrogen atoms.
890000	893000	Now, your face is interesting, reveals character.
893000	897000	Here's another spectrogeliogram taken at the same time,
897000	899000	that photographed only the violet light
899000	901000	from incandescent calcium atoms,
901000	903000	which tells us even more about you.
903000	905000	With the spectrogeliograph,
905000	907000	Dr. Robert R. McMath
907000	910000	of the McMath-Hulbert Observatory near Pontiac, Michigan
910000	913000	made the first time-lapse motion pictures
913000	916000	of the prominences and wrinkles on the face of the Sun.
916000	919000	From his pictures and from the many thousands of photographs
919000	922000	taken at observatories all over the world,
922000	925000	particularly at the Mount Wilson Observatory,
929000	932000	we've learned a great deal about Mr. Sun,
932000	934000	especially about those much-talked-of sunspots
934000	936000	that mystified Galileo.
936000	938000	Ah, sunspots. There are such things, of course.
938000	939000	Oh, yeah.
939000	942000	They're not just something that scientists see when they're tired.
942000	945000	Oh, they're very real, but very mysterious.
945000	947000	They mystified Galileo
947000	949000	and through his original telescope,
949000	952000	he first saw them moving daily across the face of the Sun.
956000	959000	And they've been mystifying us ever since.
959000	962000	Spots can appear singly, like this one,
962000	964000	or in groups like these,
964000	967000	and quite often in distinct pairs.
967000	969000	When photographed by red hydrogen light,
969000	972000	they look something like giant, violet tornadoes
972000	974000	seen from above.
975000	977000	Spots range in size from mere pinpoints
977000	979000	just a few hundred miles across,
979000	981000	into which you could drop the British Isles,
981000	982000	to huge ones,
982000	986000	into which you could drop 100 planets as big as the Earth.
987000	990000	Spots look dark, although they really aren't,
990000	992000	because they're cooler than the rest of the surface.
992000	997000	7,000 degrees is against 10,000 degrees of the surface.
997000	999000	Also, over the years,
999000	1002000	we notice a strange fluctuation in the number of spots,
1002000	1005000	increasing to a maximum, decreasing to a minimum,
1005000	1008000	in more or less regular 11-year cycles,
1008000	1010000	which many of us believe affect our weather,
1010000	1013000	our crops, and the growth of our trees.
1013000	1016000	One of the most astonishing mysteries
1016000	1018000	revealed by study of spots, Mr. Sun,
1018000	1020000	is that your equator, or the middle of you,
1020000	1022000	rotates faster than the rest of you.
1022000	1024000	The middle rotates faster?
1024000	1025000	Yes.
1025000	1027000	For instance, if a line of spots
1027000	1030000	were placed like runners at a starting line,
1030000	1033000	from the sun's north to the south pole,
1033000	1035000	and a signal raced around the sun,
1043000	1045000	they would end up like this.
1045000	1049000	Equator wins in 25 and one-third days.
1049000	1052000	Half north and half south tie for second,
1052000	1054000	time 27 and a half days.
1054000	1055000	Why is that?
1055000	1058000	You don't know why, okay.
1058000	1060000	Have you got any more pictures of me?
1060000	1063000	Hey, would it please you to know, Mr. Glory Puss,
1063000	1065000	that you've been photographed
1065000	1068000	more than all the Hollywood stars put together?
1068000	1071000	The most dramatic pictures, roll seven,
1071000	1074000	the most dramatic pictures are taken with a chronograph,
1074000	1077000	which creates automatic total eclipses
1077000	1079000	whenever the sun is shining.
1079000	1081000	This very remarkable instrument was first constructed
1081000	1085000	by Dr. Bernard Leo of France in 1930.
1085000	1087000	Today, there are improved chronographs
1087000	1090000	at the High Altitude Observatory at Climax, Colorado,
1090000	1093000	under the direction of Dr. Walter Roberts,
1093000	1095000	and at the Air Force installation
1095000	1097000	at Sacramento Peak, New Mexico,
1097000	1100000	presided over by Dr. J. W. Evans.
1100000	1102000	The first user of the chronograph in America
1102000	1106000	was Dr. Donald H. Menzel of Harvard University.
1106000	1108000	What happens in these red-hydrogen
1108000	1111000	chronograph motion pictures in one second
1111000	1114000	actually took place in about five minutes on the sun.
1114000	1117000	The small sphere you see here
1117000	1121000	represents the size of the Earth in comparison with the sun.
1121000	1125000	Your surface, Mr. Sun, is a stormy sea of violent motion.
1125000	1128000	Small spicules or geysers like these
1128000	1131000	continually burst from blisters on the surface
1131000	1133000	and jet up like little fountains,
1133000	1136000	if you can call five or 10,000 miles up, little,
1136000	1138000	compare them to the size of the Earth.
1138000	1143000	Big flame-like eruptions like these are called prominences.
1143000	1147000	They're vast clouds of gas that sometimes float idly
1147000	1150000	and other times shoot out at thousands of miles per minute
1150000	1153000	as if they'd ever heard of gravity.
1153000	1157000	Sometimes they rise in graceful ribbons or tangle streamers.
1157000	1159000	Beautiful, beautiful.
1159000	1163000	Some surge up like gigantic geysers.
1163000	1165000	Others flow sideways and downward,
1165000	1169000	at times forming natural bridges.
1169000	1171000	Portions of the prominences may even break off
1171000	1174000	and go floating away as in this picture.
1174000	1178000	But the baffling part is that most prominences flow downward.
1178000	1182000	Gases materializing from seemingly nowhere
1182000	1186000	and flowing down into sunspot areas for days at a time.
1186000	1189000	Coronal rain, it's sometimes called.
1189000	1191000	Where does it come from?
1191000	1193000	Of course, when it rains on Earth,
1193000	1195000	we don't actually see the rain go up either.
1195000	1197000	We only see it come down,
1197000	1200000	although we know it evaporates up from the seven seas.
1200000	1205000	But where coronal rain comes from, we can only guess as yet.
1205000	1207000	Given the whopper, Doc,
1207000	1209000	biggest solar explosion ever recorded
1209000	1212000	greatest photographic shot in history.
1212000	1215000	On June 4th, 1946,
1215000	1219000	a great arch of gas hundreds of times as big as the Earth
1219000	1223000	rose up at a speed of 400,000 miles per hour.
1223000	1225000	And the arch expanded clear out of rains
1225000	1229000	of the instruments at climax in less than an hour and a half.
1230000	1232000	I remember that one.
1232000	1234000	Sure blew my top that day.
1234000	1236000	Yes, we heard you.
1236000	1237000	Roll 15.
1237000	1239000	You heard me.
1239000	1241000	Oh, yes, we hear you every day.
1241000	1243000	You not only send us light waves,
1243000	1245000	but you broadcast radio waves,
1245000	1247000	which we're able to pick up quite clearly
1247000	1249000	at special radio astronomy stations,
1249000	1253000	which receive radio signals from outer space.
1253000	1256000	Here's a sample of the radio message you send us
1256000	1258000	on one of your noisier days.
1258000	1262000	In Australia, they've recently done some brilliant work
1262000	1264000	with radio astronomy.
1264000	1268000	Dr. E. G. Bowen heads the group of radio astronomers.
1268000	1270000	It's only in the past few years
1270000	1273000	that we have discovered some strange things in the sky.
1273000	1277000	Radio waves coming to us from many places in outer space.
1277000	1280000	In Australia, they've recently done some brilliant work
1280000	1282000	with radio astronomy.
1282000	1286000	Dr. E. G. Bowen heads the group of radio astronomers.
1286000	1289000	Radio astronomy is an outer space.
1289000	1292000	Radio astronomy is a brand new exciting tool for scientists,
1292000	1295000	and with it, we found out quite a bit about you, Mr. Sun,
1295000	1297000	through the noises you make.
1297000	1300000	I'm beginning to feel like a goldfish.
1300000	1302000	You got him going, doctor.
1302000	1305000	Well, doesn't all this spouting and erupting
1305000	1307000	have some effect on the Earth?
1307000	1309000	Oh, yes, tremendous out of there.
1309000	1310000	Roll 8.
1310000	1313000	Well, for instance, when a large flare
1313000	1315000	flashes up around the Sunspot area,
1315000	1319000	it immediately sends out a burst of powerful ultraviolet rays
1319000	1321000	that hit the Earth in 8 minutes.
1321000	1325000	But it also sprays streams of slower electrified fragments of atoms
1325000	1327000	out into spaces if from a hose.
1327000	1331000	This solar spray of fine particles usually misses the Earth,
1331000	1334000	but at times the Earth is in its path.
1334000	1337000	Now, the Earth is a magnet with north and south magnetic poles
1337000	1340000	and a magnetic field around it.
1340000	1343000	The spray of minute particles shot from the Sun,
1343000	1345000	which takes some 30 hours to reach the Earth,
1345000	1349000	is deflected toward the poles by the Earth's magnetic field.
1349000	1352000	As this solar dust, stardust, you might call it,
1352000	1355000	comes down into our atmosphere near the poles
1355000	1357000	and collides with air molecules,
1357000	1360000	it creates the most beautiful spectacle of the aurora,
1360000	1363000	also called the northern and southern lights.
1363000	1366000	Dr. C.W. Gartline of Cornell University
1366000	1369000	took this unique time-lapse motion picture
1369000	1372000	of the actual aurora borealis.
1373000	1376000	The Earth's rotation produces the apparent motion
1376000	1378000	of the stars in the background.
1378000	1381000	But the effects of these ultraviolet bursts from the Sun
1381000	1383000	are not so beautiful.
1383000	1387000	Voltage fluctuates, radio communications are disturbed,
1387000	1390000	and although our radio engineers have performed near miracles
1390000	1394000	in protecting our radio waves from this solar sniping,
1394000	1399000	Dr. Rural 7C, sometimes this happens.
1400000	1404000	We take you now to London for a direct report from Sam Johnson.
1404000	1406000	Come in, London.
1406000	1408000	This is Sam Johnson.
1408000	1411000	There's an air of tense expectancy here in London.
1411000	1414000	This morning, the prime minister...
1415000	1418000	Will you stop playing with that radio?
1418000	1420000	I'm not even trusted.
1420000	1422000	But then do something!
1423000	1425000	That was the momentous statement
1425000	1428000	the prime minister read to us this morning.
1428000	1430000	And now, back to New York.
1430000	1432000	What an engineer!
1434000	1436000	Wasn't the shoe? No, it wasn't the shoe.
1436000	1438000	Let's recreate what actually happened
1438000	1440000	in terms of atmosphere and radio waves.
1440000	1443000	Radio waves normally move in a straight line,
1443000	1446000	but about 50 miles high in our atmosphere,
1446000	1448000	there isn't a lot of light.
1448000	1451000	But about 50 miles high in our atmosphere,
1451000	1454000	there's an electrified layer called the ionosphere
1454000	1456000	that reflects radio waves,
1456000	1459000	making it possible to bounce them around the Earth.
1459000	1461000	Now let's listen to Sam Johnson again.
1461000	1463000	This is Sam Johnson.
1463000	1466000	There's an air of tense expectancy here in London.
1466000	1468000	Suddenly a bright flare occurs on the sun.
1468000	1471000	First, the ultraviolet rays disrupts the ionosphere.
1471000	1474000	This morning, the prime minister announced...
1474000	1476000	But radio engineers are right on the ball.
1476000	1479000	Bill, London's folding. Another SID, eh?
1479000	1480000	Yep.
1480000	1482000	I've got another frequency ready for you.
1482000	1484000	Not yet. Wait a minute.
1484000	1487000	An SID means a sudden ionospheric disturbance,
1487000	1489000	which is unpredictable.
1489000	1491000	But usually, in a matter of minutes,
1491000	1493000	the ionospheric layer reforms again.
1493000	1495000	And that was the momentous statement
1495000	1497000	the prime minister read to us this morning.
1497000	1499000	And now, back to New York.
1499000	1502000	But when big regions of the sun are intensely active,
1502000	1505000	the spray of solar particles that causes the aurora
1505000	1508000	can disturb communications for hours, even days.
1508000	1510000	But this type is predictable.
1510000	1513000	Oh, yes. Fortunately, it usually is.
1513000	1516000	And since radio communication is so vital to the services,
1516000	1520000	airlines, radio stations, telephone companies,
1520000	1522000	ships at sea,
1522000	1525000	recently observatories all over the world
1525000	1527000	have begun to keep watch on the sun
1527000	1530000	and make up a worldwide radio warning service
1530000	1533000	at the High Altitude Observatory at Climax, Colorado,
1533000	1537000	at the Air Force Observatory at Sacramento Peak,
1537000	1540000	at Kota Canal, India,
1540000	1544000	in Japan,
1544000	1546000	in stations all over the globe,
1546000	1549000	observers keep tabs on you, Mr. Sun,
1549000	1552000	and send in information to the Central Collecting Agencies,
1552000	1554000	such as the Radio Storm Warning Service
1554000	1556000	of the National Bureau of Standards,
1556000	1560000	where men under Alan Shapley analyze the data
1560000	1562000	and try to predict when the solar storm
1562000	1564000	strikes the Earth, especially the vital
1564000	1566000	North Atlantic communication lines.
1566000	1571000	Then, by radio, by teletype, by phone,
1571000	1573000	the warning goes out.
1573000	1576000	Severe magnetic storm will affect North Atlantic circuits.
1576000	1580000	Lower frequencies or use southern roots.
1580000	1582000	That's fine.
1582000	1584000	But, Dr. Research,
1584000	1588000	what has puzzled you scientists most about the sun?
1588000	1590000	Roll nine.
1590000	1593000	Even I can give you that in one word.
1593000	1595000	Energy.
1595000	1598000	This lady's parasol has one-and-one-half horsepower
1598000	1601000	of sunshine continually poured on it.
1601000	1604000	Enough to run her washing machine, sewing machine,
1604000	1606000	refrigerator, and vacuum cleaner.
1606000	1609000	In full sunlight, our family car receives
1609000	1611000	almost enough sun power to run it,
1611000	1614000	if we only knew how to use solar energy directly.
1614000	1617000	At the common rate of two cents per kilowatt hour,
1617000	1620000	the sun sends the Earth $1 billion worth of energy
1620000	1624000	every second, and it's coming to us free.
1624000	1627000	Five minutes' worth would pay our national debt.
1627000	1629000	One minute's worth of the energy that hits the Earth
1629000	1631000	would pay the total annual income tax
1631000	1633000	of all United States citizens.
1633000	1636000	Oh, happy day.
1636000	1638000	Yet what the Earth receives
1638000	1640000	is only a minute fraction of the whole,
1640000	1644000	only one part and two billion of the total solar energy.
1644000	1648000	The rest of the $500,000 billion-billion horsepower
1648000	1650000	goes out into space.
1650000	1653000	How does the sun generate this enormous amount of power,
1653000	1655000	Dr. Research?
1655000	1658000	Yes, I don't eat, drink, or take vitamins.
1658000	1660000	I never sleep or rest.
1660000	1663000	Then how do I do it, brother scientist?
1663000	1666000	Well, we know at least part of your secret now.
1666000	1690000	MUSIC
1690000	1693000	We know the answer not only to your energy,
1693000	1696000	but to what makes other stars in the universe shine.
1696000	1699000	Thermonuclear reaction.
1699000	1702000	It's the key word that wound up the universe.
1702000	1704000	Thermonuclear.
1704000	1707000	Eight to five, they've made a hydrogen bomb.
1707000	1709000	We certainly have, Mr. Sun.
1709000	1711000	And the news rocked the world.
1711000	1713000	But with you, it's old stuff.
1713000	1716000	The equivalent of four billion hydrogen bombs
1716000	1719000	have been going off inside you every second
1719000	1721000	for some four billion years.
1721000	1724000	Give or take a billion.
1724000	1726000	MUSIC
1726000	1729000	What smart guy figured that out?
1729000	1732000	Dr. Hans Bethe of Cornell is the gentleman.
1732000	1737000	In 1938, he announced that the source of the sun's energy
1737000	1741000	is the fusion of 564 million tons of hydrogen
1741000	1745000	into 560 million tons of helium each second.
1745000	1750000	564 to 560, where did the missing 4 million tons go?
1750000	1751000	Just disappear?
1751000	1754000	Disappears as mass, as matter,
1754000	1758000	but reappears as light, heat, and all sorts of radiation.
1758000	1762000	Quite a trickster, old Sol, making 4 million tons disappear.
1762000	1764000	4 million tons?
1764000	1766000	That he is.
1766000	1767000	Roll 12.
1767000	1769000	I brought along a trickster friend of mine,
1769000	1772000	Thermo the magician, who has an act which he claims
1772000	1775000	explains the sun's magic.
1775000	1779000	I am Thermo.
1779000	1782000	I will do for you such a trick.
1782000	1785000	Only me and the stars can do.
1785000	1787000	Pay attention.
1787000	1790000	This is one way to make a hydrogen bomb.
1790000	1792000	Nature's way.
1792000	1794000	So, hydrogen.
1794000	1797000	One, two, three, four.
1797000	1799000	What is hydrogen?
1799000	1803000	The smallest atom from which you build all the other atoms.
1803000	1806000	So, we will weigh the hydrogen.
1806000	1808000	Scale.
1808000	1811000	Each bottle weighs exactly 100 ounces.
1811000	1814000	For bottles, 400 ounces.
1814000	1815000	Remember that.
1815000	1817000	400 ounces.
1817000	1819000	So, now, carbon.
1819000	1821000	This is carbon.
1821000	1823000	A piece of coal for you.
1823000	1825000	That is what I start with.
1825000	1827000	Hydrogen and carbon.
1827000	1829000	So, now I will heat them.
1829000	1832000	30 million degrees, I will heat them.
1832000	1834000	How?
1834000	1835000	Hydrogen bomb.
1835000	1838000	It is done by exploding an ordinary atom bomb
1838000	1841000	to ignite the hydrogen bomb.
1841000	1844000	But the stars, they do it by pressure.
1844000	1845000	Gravity.
1845000	1847000	Like our Mr. Sun.
1847000	1851000	So, now I play Mr. Sun and heat the hydrogen
1851000	1855000	and the carbon to 30 million degrees.
1855000	1856000	Fire.
1856000	1857000	Fire.
1857000	1858000	Fire.
1858000	1859000	Fire.
1859000	1861000	Now I am ready.
1861000	1864000	One hydrogen, come.
1864000	1868000	I thermal now give the command.
1868000	1871000	Fusion.
1871000	1873000	So, what have we here?
1873000	1874000	Nitrogen.
1874000	1879000	The gas what makes four-fifths of the air you breathe.
1879000	1880000	Air.
1880000	1883000	Now, number two and number three hydrogen,
1883000	1884000	come.
1884000	1887000	Fusion.
1887000	1889000	Now we have oxygen.
1889000	1891000	Another-fifth of the air you breathe.
1891000	1893000	Number four.
1893000	1895000	Fusion.
1895000	1896000	Huh?
1896000	1898000	Now we have coal again.
1898000	1899000	Same piece.
1899000	1901000	And we have helium.
1901000	1904000	What you feel ballooned with.
1904000	1907000	Four hydrogens, if they are 30 million degrees hot,
1907000	1909000	30 million degrees.
1909000	1912000	It is not children playing with matches.
1912000	1915000	The four hydrogens come out one helium.
1915000	1917000	The carbon comes back the same.
1917000	1919000	You see, same way, no change.
1919000	1923000	That's why we call this the carbon cycle.
1923000	1925000	Now we weigh the helium.
1925000	1928000	Should weigh 400 ounces like the hydrogen.
1928000	1930000	Oh yes, naturally.
1930000	1932000	But it can be.
1932000	1935000	The helium weighs three ounces less than the hydrogen.
1935000	1938000	Where did the three ounces go?
1938000	1942000	That is the magic of the stars.
1942000	1945000	That is the secret of the hydrogen bomb.
1945000	1947000	I show you.
1947000	1950000	Come back three ounces.
1950000	1952000	Here is where they went.
1952000	1955000	They changed into...
1960000	1962000	Now the energy in those three little ounces
1962000	1964000	that completely disappeared as matter,
1964000	1966000	that energy is enough to raise
1966000	1970000	the Empire State Building 2,500 miles high.
1975000	1978000	Now the carbon cycle, which is what Thermo just explained to us,
1978000	1981000	is not the only way in which you can change hydrogen
1981000	1983000	into helium plus energy.
1983000	1986000	You may also use a very special and rare process
1986000	1989000	in which you put two hydrogen atoms together directly.
1989000	1992000	Is that the famous proton-proton process?
1992000	1995000	See, you've been reading.
1995000	1998000	Mr. Son, you do not annihilate or destroy
1998000	2000000	just two or three ounces.
2000000	2004000	But four million tons of hydrogen matter each second.
2004000	2006000	That gives you your unbelievable energy,
2006000	2008000	which you radiate out into space.
2008000	2010000	We think that originally,
2010000	2012000	you were a great loose cloud of gas,
2012000	2015000	mostly hydrogen, being contracted by gravity.
2015000	2018000	As you were compressed, the temperature went up.
2018000	2020000	Just as the air in a bicycle tire gets hotter and hotter
2020000	2022000	as you pump it.
2022000	2024000	Finally, the temperature in your core
2024000	2026000	reached the necessary 30 million degrees
2026000	2028000	needed to trigger the thermonuclear reaction.
2028000	2030000	Presto, the furnace was lit.
2030000	2033000	Never to go out again as long as you live, Mr. Son.
2033000	2037000	The hydrogen began burning into helium and energy.
2037000	2039000	Gravity tries to compress you.
2039000	2042000	Burning hydrogen tries to expand you.
2042000	2044000	The two forces just balance each other.
2044000	2046000	What's perfection itself?
2046000	2048000	A furnace made of its own fuel.
2048000	2051000	An immense, continuous hydrogen bomb
2051000	2055000	operating at an even heat for billions of years.
2055000	2059000	What a wonderful invention you are, Mr. Son.
2059000	2061000	Which brings up a point.
2061000	2065000	How long before he runs out of this here now, hydrogen fuel?
2065000	2069000	Oh, he still has about 98% of his fuel left.
2069000	2072000	But 50, 100 billion years from now, Mr. Son,
2072000	2074000	you'll perhaps run out of fuel.
2074000	2077000	You'll expire, go wherever good stars go.
2077000	2080000	We'll go with you because as you go, we go.
2080000	2084000	You see, you're not just a big blob of hot mass to us.
2084000	2086000	You're the head of our family.
2086000	2088000	We want to know more about you.
2088000	2090000	We depend on you for our very existence.
2090000	2092000	Yes, in fact, we're depending on you heavily
2092000	2095000	for the solution of two of man's biggest problems.
2095000	2098000	Well, at last I'm being appreciated.
2098000	2101000	What did you say your name was?
2101000	2104000	Dr. Research, your big...
2104000	2108000	What are those two big problems you spoke of, Dr. Research?
2108000	2111000	The first is the age-old problem of food.
2111000	2112000	Roll five.
2112000	2115000	And boy, the number of miles that need food keeps increasing.
2115000	2119000	In 1650, after 25,000 years of man,
2119000	2122000	our population had reached half a billion.
2122000	2125000	By 1950, only 300 years later,
2125000	2128000	the population climbed to two and one half billion,
2128000	2130000	five times as many.
2130000	2132000	Out of all human beings who ever lived,
2132000	2135000	one out of 20 is alive today.
2135000	2137000	One out of 20? Alive today?
2137000	2139000	Isn't that amazing?
2139000	2142000	We never had food enough for all in the past.
2142000	2145000	We don't have enough for all today.
2145000	2148000	Two out of every three persons on Earth
2148000	2152000	naturally eat below the minimum necessary for health.
2152000	2156000	Yet 100 million new babies are born every year.
2156000	2159000	A yearly baby crop nearly equal to the population
2159000	2161000	of all of South America.
2161000	2163000	And all born hungry.
2163000	2166000	Yes, our population's practically exploding.
2169000	2172000	I bet he doesn't know who grows his food for him.
2172000	2174000	Oh, yeah, we know quite a bit about that.
2174000	2176000	That is he does.
2176000	2177000	Roll four.
2177000	2181000	Our food is grown by a natural process called photosynthesis,
2181000	2184000	which means putting together with light, your light,
2184000	2189000	the oldest, biggest and most important manufacturing operation in the world.
2189000	2194000	99% of all our food and fuel is created by photosynthesis,
2194000	2199000	a process that goes on only in plants, never in animals.
2199000	2202000	On every green leaf, there are millions of
2202000	2205000	sub-microscopic little one-man factories
2205000	2209000	turning out more sugar than all the ships and railroads in the world could carry.
2209000	2214000	And the head man of each factory is a little green molecule called chlorophyll,
2214000	2219000	the only engineer with a know-how about this still secret life process.
2219000	2222000	Chlorophyll is so small and so secretive
2222000	2225000	that not even the most powerful microscopes can spy on him.
2230000	2232000	Here's the way we think he works.
2233000	2236000	The veins of the leaf bring him water from the roots.
2236000	2240000	From the air, he grabs a molecule of carbon dioxide, CO2.
2240000	2244000	He puts a water molecule and a carbon dioxide molecule together.
2244000	2247000	Then he reaches for a piece of sunlight,
2247000	2251000	and this is what we don't quite know how he adds this sunlight.
2251000	2253000	And I'm not going to tell you either.
2253000	2255000	You can darn well find out for yourself.
2255000	2256000	Quiet.
2256000	2260000	Piece by piece, he adds more sunlight to his sugarcane.
2260000	2265000	Then he pulls out an oxygen atom from the mixture and releases it into the air.
2265000	2267000	And the Russians didn't invent me either.
2267000	2269000	I invented myself.
2270000	2273000	Then he takes some sauce that come up in the veins,
2273000	2275000	sprinkles them over the mixture for icing,
2275000	2279000	and puts the completed sugar cake into a waiting artery.
2279000	2282000	Out of this sugar or sunshine cake,
2282000	2286000	the tree makes leaves, trunk, roots, and fruit.
2287000	2292000	In the sea, chlorophyll produces even more food than he does on land.
2292000	2296000	The whole surface of the seas is teeming with billions of tons of a minute,
2296000	2299000	single-cell vegetable called phytoplankton.
2301000	2307000	These in turn are eaten by countless, almost invisible little animals called zooplankton.
2307000	2309000	Which are eaten by little fish.
2311000	2313000	Which are eaten by bigger fish.
2314000	2316000	Which are eaten by still bigger fish.
2320000	2325000	Yes, all fish are ultimately made of chlorophyll sunshine cake.
2325000	2330000	And when we catch them and can them, we're catching and canning sunlight.
2332000	2337000	In fact, all animals feed on sunshine cake in one form or another.
2344000	2349000	The energy the junior gets from milk was in a contented cow 24 hours ago.
2349000	2353000	24 hours before that, the same energy was in clover,
2353000	2357000	which had absorbed it from sunlight that had come 93 million miles in eight minutes
2357000	2359000	from the surface of the sun,
2359000	2365000	but had taken 20 million years to find its way to the surface from the sun's central furnace.
2365000	2368000	So you see the energy that makes junior run,
2368000	2370000	that makes a porpoise leap,
2373000	2375000	and makes me talk so much.
2375000	2379000	That energy is hydrogen that burned in your central furnace
2379000	2382000	long, long before man walked the earth.
2382000	2385000	You know, brother research, I'm beginning to like you.
2385000	2388000	Do all the people know these things about me?
2388000	2390000	No, that's why this program.
2390000	2393000	What's the big hitch in the food problem?
2393000	2396000	For one thing, chlorophyll is too slow.
2396000	2398000	Take any acre of forest or vegetables.
2398000	2400000	The amount of sunshine converted to plant food
2400000	2403000	averages only two tons of vegetable matter per year.
2403000	2407000	But if all the lights you send us could be used by chlorophyll,
2407000	2411000	we could raise 2,000 tons of food per acre per year.
2411000	2415000	A little chlorophyll may know the big secret, but he's awfully inefficient.
2417000	2419000	Oh, who's inefficient?
2419000	2421000	I just make sugar.
2421000	2424000	Can I help it? It's so silly. Please build a trunk soon.
2424000	2427000	Branches and roots out of it, but you can't eat.
2427000	2430000	What you're looking for is a plant that's all fruit.
2430000	2432000	Oh, there is such a plant.
2432000	2433000	Oh, edible, too.
2433000	2435000	And it multiplies faster than rabbits.
2435000	2438000	But you scientists are too dumb to find it.
2442000	2446000	There you are, Mr. Man. Find the plant.
2446000	2448000	Oh, we found it already, Mr. Son.
2448000	2449000	Roll ten.
2449000	2451000	Found it in freshwater lakes.
2451000	2453000	A kind of green algae called chlorella,
2453000	2456000	a tiny one-celled plant that has learned the mathematical trick
2456000	2458000	of multiplying by dividing.
2458000	2462000	Each cell gives birth to from four to 16 daughter cells,
2462000	2465000	which all grow up and repeat the process.
2465000	2469000	Chlorella contains fats, carbohydrates, and up to 50% proteins,
2469000	2470000	and is all edible.
2470000	2473000	All fruit is, Mr. Chlorell would say.
2473000	2477000	All over the world, scientists are doing research on chlorella.
2477000	2481000	In Japan, Dr. Hiroshi Tamia of the Tokugawa Institute
2481000	2484000	has done some of the most interesting and practical work.
2484000	2487000	For there, food is definitely a problem.
2489000	2494000	Into these troughs, water containing chlorella cultures is pumped.
2494000	2496000	Nutrient salts are added.
2496000	2499000	The troughs are covered with plastic sheeting to let in sunlight
2499000	2502000	while extra carbon dioxide is bubbled into the solution.
2502000	2505000	When the culture becomes intensely green,
2505000	2507000	the chlorella crop is harvested.
2507000	2512000	After washing and drying, the fine powder looks like green flour.
2512000	2516000	Mrs. Tamia, wife of the director, has added this to regular flour
2516000	2519000	and made excellent biscuits and cakes out of it.
2519000	2522000	If these processes ever become practical,
2522000	2526000	underfed populations may have a new, rich source of food.
2526000	2527000	Yes, indeed.
2527000	2532000	An acre of chlorella can convert sunlight into some 20 tons of plant matter
2532000	2535000	against one or two tons of an ordinary crop.
2535000	2539000	But there's a second great problem facing us eventually.
2549000	2552000	For thousands of years, we got our fuel from burning wood.
2552000	2555000	Sun power, Mr. Sun stored up in trees.
2555000	2557000	Next, we put animals to work.
2557000	2559000	Sun power from grass.
2559000	2563000	Then came educated power to do work animals couldn't be taught to do.
2563000	2567000	Human slave power to build roads, pyramids and row ships.
2567000	2569000	Sun power with brains.
2569000	2571000	But slaves had to be fed.
2571000	2576000	So we discovered power that didn't eat, like windmills and water wheels.
2576000	2580000	The machine age was born.
2580000	2584000	But modern machines need to be fed too, fed with fuels.
2584000	2586000	Where do we get the fuels?
2586000	2588000	From the big fuel man himself.
2588000	2592000	Over the ages, Mr. Sun was kind enough to store them up for him.
2592000	2594000	Chomp for living sunshine.
2598000	2600000	Thing for fossil sunshine.
2604000	2606000	Drill for liquid sunshine.
2610000	2612000	Dams for silent sunshine.
2613000	2614000	Fuel.
2615000	2616000	Fuel.
2617000	2618000	More fuel.
2619000	2621000	How much fuel is in the bank?
2621000	2623000	How big is the trust fund the old boy left us?
2625000	2626000	Roll 13.
2628000	2631000	Well, suppose all our energy had been deposited
2631000	2633000	in the Sun power bank incorporated,
2633000	2637000	founded millions of years ago with assets unlimited.
2637000	2640000	In 1850, each American for instance,
2640000	2642000	withdrew enough fuel from the fuel bank
2642000	2646000	to generate 400 horsepower hours for himself.
2646000	2648000	But nobody worried too much about it.
2648000	2650000	Our assets still appeared unlimited.
2650000	2655000	In 1950, each American withdrew 10,000 horsepower hours
2655000	2657000	from Sun power incorporated,
2657000	2660000	while atomic scientists were making some minor deposits.
2660000	2662000	This began to worry us.
2662000	2665000	Our assets were becoming definitely limited.
2665000	2668000	By 1975, we'll probably be able to do something
2668000	2674000	but by 1975, we'll probably withdraw 20,000 horsepower hours each.
2674000	2678000	Atomic energy fuel deposits will stave off the run for some time,
2678000	2681000	but there's only so much uranium and thorium in the world,
2681000	2683000	and that will go too.
2683000	2687000	When the principal's gone, you're going to have to live on your income, huh?
2687000	2690000	But our income is only about 10% of our power spending.
2690000	2691000	We need help.
2691000	2694000	Every day I send you a thousand times more power
2694000	2696000	than you use in a year.
2696000	2697000	It's up to you, fellows.
2697000	2702000	Anybody working on getting power direct from old blowhard here?
2702000	2704000	Oh, yes, but not nearly enough.
2704000	2705000	Roll six feet.
2705000	2708000	Some years ago, Dr. Charles Greeley Abbott,
2708000	2711000	an enthusiastic pioneer in solar engines,
2711000	2714000	designed this vacuum-jacketed boiler tube
2714000	2716000	at the focus of a parabolic mirror,
2716000	2721000	which will convert sunlight to engine power.
2721000	2724000	Today, the French laboratory of solar energy
2724000	2727000	has an enormous solar furnace at Mont Louis
2727000	2729000	for metal research at high temperatures.
2729000	2732000	In India, Dr. S. Batnagar,
2732000	2734000	the famous Indian scientist,
2734000	2737000	experimented with solar cookers for home use.
2737000	2739000	On one of these cookers,
2739000	2741000	an Indian family can cook its noonday meal
2741000	2744000	with no heat other than the sun's heat.
2748000	2751000	Some other ways depend on glass.
2751000	2753000	Sunlight coming through a window,
2753000	2755000	heats up everything in the room,
2755000	2758000	but heat radiated back from furniture and floor
2758000	2760000	is long heat waves,
2760000	2763000	which the window glass stops from going back out,
2763000	2765000	thus trapping the sun's heat.
2765000	2767000	Is that why greenhouses covered with glass
2767000	2770000	are warmer inside than the air outside?
2770000	2771000	Right.
2771000	2773000	That's why your closed car gets so unbearably hot
2773000	2775000	standing out in the sun.
2775000	2778000	Dr. Maria Telkis has designed a model house in Massachusetts
2778000	2781000	in which solar heat is ingeniously collected,
2781000	2784000	stored, and distributed throughout the whole house.
2786000	2789000	Now, these are more or less well-known mechanical ways
2789000	2791000	of using sun power directly.
2791000	2794000	There's exciting research going on with some brand new ways.
2794000	2796000	You think Mr. Clarifill was pretty smart
2796000	2798000	with his tricky sunshine cake
2798000	2800000	that makes food out of your sunlight?
2800000	2802000	Well, the science boys have come up with a sunshine cake
2802000	2804000	that makes electricity out of your sunlight.
2804000	2806000	Oh, yes. You mean the solar battery?
2806000	2808000	That's hardly even a cookie yet, let alone a cake.
2808000	2810000	Doc, that's big news.
2810000	2812000	Well, it was the solar battery.
2812000	2816000	Now, held in the sun, this thin little cell,
2816000	2818000	a sunshine wafer we might call it,
2818000	2821000	produces a usable amount of electric current
2821000	2823000	out of the sunlight that falls on it.
2823000	2825000	It was cooked up out of basic research
2825000	2828000	at the Bell Telephone Lab by three scientists,
2828000	2833000	Darrell Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson.
2833000	2836000	You know, although this is quite expensive at the moment,
2836000	2839000	the simplicity of this sunshine wafer is startling.
2839000	2842000	What bake one for a glory, Puss Doc?
2842000	2844000	I'd be delighted.
2844000	2847000	Look at him. Oh, pastry cook research.
2847000	2850000	The recipe for this solar wafer
2850000	2852000	sounds just like a vacation.
2852000	2854000	Just sand and sunshine.
2854000	2856000	Thank you, son.
2856000	2858000	Ah!
2858000	2863000	Plain old sand is composed of silicon and oxygen.
2863000	2866000	It's time to go to meeting name as silicon dioxide.
2866000	2869000	Separate out the oxygen and the bits of seaweed,
2869000	2872000	bottle tops, and other odds and ends.
2872000	2875000	And we have left a metal silicon.
2875000	2879000	Ah, but our silicon must be pure silicon.
2879000	2885000	So we purify it, and purify it until it's as pure as the driven snow.
2885000	2887000	Now melt the silicon,
2887000	2890000	and add just a pinch of arsenic for flavor.
2890000	2892000	Mix thoroughly.
2892000	2896000	Then cool until it crystallizes.
2896000	2899000	Then from the arsenic flavored silicon roll,
2899000	2902000	slice off a razor thin wafer.
2902000	2904000	Put the wafer into the oven.
2904000	2907000	Fill oven with a boron gas,
2907000	2909000	and bake the white heat.
2909000	2914000	The boron cooks into the surface, forms an extremely thin icing over the wafer.
2914000	2916000	Remove finished wafer.
2916000	2919000	Connect one wire from electric motor to boron icing,
2919000	2921000	and the other wire to the wafer itself.
2921000	2923000	Expose wafer to sunlight.
2923000	2924000	Presto!
2924000	2927000	The motor starts running with the efficiency of an automobile,
2927000	2931000	and nothing is used up but the sunshine, which is free.
2931000	2932000	Is that something?
2932000	2935000	Well, I'll be darned.
2935000	2937000	So you see in a solar battery,
2937000	2940000	it's energy from the sun that moves the electricity,
2940000	2942000	which in turn rotates motors.
2949000	2952000	It's energy from the sun that moves the electricity.
2952000	2955000	It's energy from the sun that moves the electricity.
2955000	2959000	It's energy from the sun that moves the electricity.
2959000	2962000	It's energy from the sun that moves the electricity.
2962000	2964000	Or as in this case,
2964000	2970000	powers rural telephone lines by charging storage batteries.
2970000	2972000	But the solar battery isn't all.
2972000	2976000	There's other important research in changing sunlight into power.
2976000	2980000	Dr. E. I. Rabinowitz has put together a chemical cell
2980000	2983000	that'll change light waves into electric current.
2983000	2986000	But storing sun power for night use
2986000	2989000	is a big part of this energy from the sun problem.
2989000	2992000	Well, Dr. Lawrence J. Height of MIT
2992000	2994000	is experimenting with a process
2994000	2999000	in which sunlight decomposes water back into oxygen and hydrogen,
2999000	3001000	the hydrogen being a storable fuel.
3001000	3003000	Another possibility.
3003000	3006000	Phosphors are chemical powders that absorb sunlight
3006000	3009000	and can give it back slowly in the dark.
3009000	3012000	I read where Westinghouse engineers predict a wallpaper
3012000	3015000	containing phosphors which will absorb daylight during the day,
3015000	3017000	then glow for hours after dark.
3017000	3021000	A city painted with phosphor paint of the future might glow all night.
3021000	3023000	These are some of the processes
3023000	3027000	that are being researched on a small scale today, Mr. Sun.
3027000	3032000	But our engineers can't turn the wheels of industry on little wafers.
3032000	3034000	They'll have to build efficient generators
3034000	3037000	that spread out over acres, even square miles,
3037000	3040000	to compete with the cheap, cold, and oil still available to us.
3040000	3043000	And the doctor, what about atomic power?
3043000	3045000	Oh, great hopes for it, of course.
3045000	3048000	Especially now, since atomic plants can make their own fuel
3048000	3050000	with so-called breeder reactors.
3050000	3053000	Some even dream of imitating the stars,
3053000	3056000	getting power from hydrogen fusion.
3056000	3061000	But if dreams fail, the answer must be sun power from our Mr. Sun.
3061000	3066000	What if you don't find ways to use my free sunshine for fuel?
3066000	3069000	Then the machine age is over.
3072000	3074000	We'll have to go back to muscle power
3074000	3079000	and the half-billion population that muscle power alone can support.
3087000	3089000	But that will never happen.
3089000	3091000	Oh, no, why not?
3091000	3096000	Because man's greatest power source is his mind.
3096000	3099000	God gave him that, not you.
3099000	3105000	Without taking a step, he can travel faster and farther than any animal.
3105000	3109000	Without even getting wet, he can out-swim any fish.
3109000	3114000	Without a fell on him, he can fly faster and higher
3114000	3117000	and farther than any eagle.
3120000	3125000	He can send his eyes and ears hundreds of miles into space
3125000	3128000	where he's never even been.
3131000	3134000	And his pride opened the secret of the atom,
3134000	3137000	which he's never even seen.
3137000	3139000	When his fuel's run low,
3139000	3143000	man's mind and imagination will meet the challenge
3143000	3147000	and invent undreamed of ways to use the free sunlight
3148000	3151000	God showers down upon him.
3151000	3157000	Just remember, somebody must love you very much.
3157000	3162000	That planet that you live on is not like all the rest.
3162000	3166000	You're blessed with just the right size,
3166000	3170000	the right temperature, the right atmosphere,
3170000	3172000	the right composition.
3172000	3177000	Everything just right to produce the biggest miracle of all.
3179000	3181000	Life.
3181000	3187000	So go ahead, ask, inquire, seek the truth.
3187000	3189000	It's right that you should know
3189000	3194000	or the good Lord wouldn't have given you that driving curiosity.
3194000	3198000	Measure the outside with mathematics,
3198000	3201000	but measure the inside with prayer.
3201000	3207000	Prayer is researched to study man as well as the world.
3207000	3209000	So keep on pitching.
3209000	3212000	The best is yet to come for you.
3212000	3218000	I predict man's next great adventure will be the sun age.
3218000	3223000	When that happens, you'll be rich beyond all dreams.
3223000	3228000	I predict great sun cities built on desert wastelands
3228000	3232000	where everything is run by sunlight.
3232000	3234000	I predict...
3234000	3236000	Oh, sure, that's fine.
3236000	3239000	But suppose I begin cutting up, then what?
3239000	3240000	You won't.
3240000	3244000	But if you did, man has migrated many times before
3244000	3247000	and he'll do it again if he has to.
3247000	3251000	If you make it too hot for him on Earth,
3251000	3255000	man is capable of conceiving a way to move the whole kitten
3255000	3260000	to bootle the greener pastures on some other planet.
3266000	3268000	Oh, no, we like it here.
3268000	3270000	Don't change on us, Mr. Sun.
3270000	3273000	We used to worship you as an unknown god.
3273000	3275000	But now that we know you better,
3275000	3278000	we love you as our great and good friend.
3278000	3281000	So keep on shining, Mr. Sun.
3283000	3287000	Thanks for all the radiant riches you showered down upon us.
3287000	3291000	Thanks for our eyes and all the glories we behold.
3291000	3294000	Thanks for all the green forests,
3294000	3297000	the great deposit of black dimes,
3297000	3302000	the deep pools of liquid gold you put in the bank for us.
3302000	3304000	Thanks for the wheat fields,
3304000	3307000	all the fruits and flowers you grow for us.
3307000	3310000	Thanks for feeding our animals,
3310000	3313000	our birds, our insects,
3313000	3315000	all the fish in the sea.
3315000	3320000	And thanks especially for the glory and beauty of your good mornings
3320000	3322000	and your good evenings
3322000	3325000	and the words of St. Francis.
3325000	3328000	Be praised, my Lord, in what you have created.
3328000	3333000	Above all else, be praised in our brother, Master Sun.
3334000	3336000	Good night, brotherhood.
3336000	3339000	Now you're hooking the sunshine.
3365000	3369000	The Bell Telephone System takes pride in bringing you this program
3369000	3372000	in its series of shows on science.
3372000	3374000	We wish to express our gratitude
3374000	3376000	to the distinguished board of advisors
3376000	3381000	who guide the choice and treatment of scientific matter for the series.
3381000	3383000	For the program you have just seen,
3383000	3385000	our thanks to the special advisors
3385000	3389000	who have suggested and checked the scientific material.
3389000	3392000	The Bell Telephone System is indebted to all these men
3392000	3394000	and to many institutions
3394000	3397000	for the generous support they have given this venture
3397000	3400000	in public education through entertainment.
