1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The Bell Telephone System brings you one of a series of programs on science to understand nature's laws.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The Bell Telephone System brings you one of a series of programs on science to understand nature's laws.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Let's try that focus again, Jim.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Coming up.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The title's okay.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now let's test that first animation.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Roll two.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay, hold it.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now sharpen the focus.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Right.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hold roll two.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Doctor, how is the son born?

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Don't know exactly.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're a scientist and you don't know?

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Could use my imagination, but you're the fiction writer.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Imagination?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, we could ask Mr. Sun himself.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, if we had a magic wand.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sure, sure.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You've got it.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Magic.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Your science and my magic.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We'll open up our story of our Mr. Sun with a little fantasy.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You know, showmanship.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Go back into time.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Show the birth of the sun out of time, stardust.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Here, we'll turn back the clock.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh, that'll only take you back 12 hours.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
All right.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We'll open up the curtain of our imagination.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This'll be our magic screen.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yours will be just for facts.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We'll pull back the curtains of our magic screen.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We'll dream up a clock.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There you are.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
A clock that's been ticking since time began.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Our solar system wound up by Father Time himself.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you see what I'm seeing?

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, certainly.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe I could talk to him, huh?

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hey, Father Time, how long has that sun clock been going?

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
A few billion years.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Why?

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, could you unwind it for us?

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Unwind time?

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Man, are you crazy?

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, I'm a fiction writer.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We're auditioning a show about our Mr. Sun,

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and I thought that...

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Show about me?

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Well, well, about time.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Look who's here.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hi.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, we were wondering how it all happened at the beginning.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Nobody knows what happened at the beginning.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, come on.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Pop, unwind us.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They want to see how I was born.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You... you old hot gas bag.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You keep still.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Now, don't flip your sickle, Pop.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The man says it's just a show.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
He's a romantic fool.

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If you want facts, ask your scientists.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, we've got doctor research here for facts.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But what I need right now is something to open this thing up with a bang.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You know what I mean?

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Certainly.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
My story should be colorful, romantic, not just facts.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Here, I'll tell you how it should open.

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Wait a minute.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm telling this story.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're just imaginary.

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Quiet.

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You want a show, don't you?

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Go on.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes, sir?

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Set the stage for me.

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, yes, sir.

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Uh-uh.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You had an Academy Award, really.

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hey, he's taking over.

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How do you like that?

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I like it.

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let him go on.

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Music.

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Lights.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Color.

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And here, Mr. Sun from the East.

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Good morning, Brother Earth.

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
For the empty billionth time.

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Good morning.

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Good morning, Brother Bird.

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Brother Mountain.

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Brother Sea.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Morning to you, Brother Gal.

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Brother Bee.

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Brother Fish.

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Good morning, all of you.

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Great day.

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Every day's a great day.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You know me as the sun.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Of course, what I really am is a star.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
An average, everyday type of star.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Billions like me.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I remember when Primitive Man first began to look up

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
to gaze in wonderment at the stars and planets

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
sweeping across the face of the sky.

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That primitive curiosity was the beginning of all your science.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Of course, they had some pretty odd notions about me.

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Some thought I was an enormous beetle

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
crumbling a fiery ball across the heavens.

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The ancient Eskimos thought I was a little man

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
wearing thick furs to keep myself warm.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But to most, I was a god.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Fancy names and wardrobes.

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
In Babylon, I was Shamash.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And my sun temples were observatories.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
In Persia, I was Mithras.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And to ancient Egypt, I was the great god Rah.

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Glory to the great sun god.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hold our perfect, our eternal, our only one.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Blame me for getting the swell head.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Ah, but the name I like best was Phoebus Apollo.

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The Greeks always didn't have a word for it.

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
In my case, it was handsome.

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Apollo racing across the sky in his fiery chariot

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
making heavenly music on his golden ukulele.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh, that was for me.

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I loved it.

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And then along came another Greek to spoil it all.

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
A Greek who would rather think than worship sun gods.

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Anaxagoras was his name.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The sun is not a god or a person.

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It is a mass of red hot stone,

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
only 40 miles across and 4,000 miles away.

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
For blaspheming against the beautiful Apollo,

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Anaxagoras was banished from Athens.

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And I wasn't a bit sorry for him.

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But man had fallen for this new and fascinating mistress, his brain.

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Thinking began spreading like the measles.

143
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Everybody got the bug.

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The Greeks with their logic and philosophy.

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The Hindus with their algebra and your present number system.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The Arabs with their early instruments like the astrolabe.

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And today instead of temples, rituals and hymns to the sun,

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
it's domes, gadgets, charts and numbers.

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm demoted to a specimen, a pile of facts and figures.

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
A big blob of mass holding little blobs of mass together with gravity.

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Instead of with love, I think you're all through.

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Who's all through?

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Earthman. He's had it.

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Why you flaming idiot, I haven't even started yet.

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
In worshiping me, ancient man was reaching for the great light beyond.

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But modern man, he's got all the answers.

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Mr. Sun, you mind if I butt in a moment?

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Who are you?

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Who me? Oh, I'm the...

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Never mind. Thank you very much. Goodbye.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Would you mind if we listened in?

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
See here, you're not even real. I just made you up. You go wind your clock.

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No, let them stay. I like your magic. Father Time, my name's Research.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Who?

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
A scientist.

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Hmm.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Howdy, Doctor Research.

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'd like to hear what you have to say about Golden Boy here.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, it's a delightful experience talking directly to you and to Mr. Sun, especially for a scientist.

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I was just going to relate a few facts about Mr. Sun.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Facts? If you're going to tell my story, don't give the people equations and figures.

172
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Give them the real old doubt. Tell them what I mean to them.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
They've forgotten that. When they eat corn or bread or grapes or meat, they're eating sunlight.

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Their houses, furniture, cars, they're nylons.

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes, even their moonshine is sunshine.

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Tell them if it wasn't for me, they'd have no eyes, because there'd be nothing to see.

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's enough. You're getting purple.

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Why, if I put my light out, every living thing on Earth would be frozen stiff.

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And you scientists who know would be just as cold and stiff as the people that don't know.

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Through blowing sunspots?

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes.

182
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Then apologize to Doctor Research.

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Well, I'm sorry, Brother Research.

184
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No apology necessary. Mr. Sun is almost right.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Almost?

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes. Mr. Sun, your logic is a little on the romantic side, too.

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You say that you don't like facts, and yet you've just given us quite a list of them.

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This may turn out to be fun.

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No, Mr. Sun, we haven't got all the answers.

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Science has just opened the book, yet in seeking for more knowledge,

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
we, too, in a way, are reaching for the great light beyond.

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Doctor, that's it. That's it.

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What's it? The gimmick.

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Come into my office here.

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We put the show on for him.

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
For the Sun?

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Sure. It's a tough audience.

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Science shows Sun were not all through, you get it?

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Could be boring to him.

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Could be.

201
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You keep your corona on.

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Science has found out about you as more exciting than any fiction.

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You stick around, you'll see.

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What we really don't know very much about him.

205
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, we know plenty about him.

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What about the television people?

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Never mind him.

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Just think, we've got a real show here.

209
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Well, you remember where you come in.

210
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I remember the weather, the fuel, the entertainment.

211
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And you cut in on me if I get stuff in.

212
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll cut in on you, but come on.

213
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Roll him, roll him.

214
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Roll to.

215
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Here we go.

216
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Although Mr. Sun is 93 million miles away,

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and it takes his life eight minutes to reach us,

218
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
we're pretty close.

219
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The light from the next nearest star,

220
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
traveling at 186,000 miles per second,

221
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
takes over four years to get to us.

222
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We know Mr. Sun is so large,

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
our Earth is barely visible alongside him.

224
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It would take some 340 worlds, like beads on a string,

225
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
to make a necklace around his shining sphere.

226
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
How much does Mr. Sun weigh?

227
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
1,000 worlds?

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
100,000?

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No, sir.

230
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He weighs as much as 330,000 Mother Earths.

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We also know that Mr. Sun is not solid or liquid,

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
but a fiery ball of hot, glowing gases,

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
consisting of some 95% hydrogen and helium,

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and a few percent all other elements.

235
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We know that this huge cloud of hot gases

236
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
would expand, float away, dissipate into space,

237
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
unless gravity squeezed it together into a tight sphere.

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The gases at the center of the Sun are so densely packed by gravity

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
that they're about 100 times heavier than water.

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And the pressure is around 1 billion tons to the square inch.

241
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
While at the surface, the gases are so thin,

242
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
the pressure is only about one pound to the square inch.

243
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We know too that the temperature at the core of the Sun

244
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
is incredibly hot, around 30 million degrees Fahrenheit.

245
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
While at the surface, it drops down to just about 10,000 degrees.

246
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But here's a strange thing.

247
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
As we go out from the Sun into the corona,

248
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
the temperature goes up again

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
to over 1 million degrees at the outer edges.

250
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Tell them why, Dr. Research.

251
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We don't know why.

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You don't? Well, what is the corona anyway?

253
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We don't actually know that yet.

254
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But we do know there's more to Mr. Sun

255
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
than the shining surface we normally see,

256
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
which we call a photosphere or sphere of light.

257
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Only when the moon moves between us and the Sun

258
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and covers the photosphere completely in a total eclipse

259
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
can we see the rest of Mr. Sun's thin atmosphere,

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
the beautiful and mysterious corona.

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
For many, many years, scientists have lugged their instruments

262
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
to all parts of the globe chasing eclipses.

263
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Music

264
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Expedition spending months,

265
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
just for a two or three-minute opportunity to see,

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
measure, and photograph the eclipsed Sun.

267
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Sometimes heavy clouds, failure, complete washout.

268
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Sometimes light clouds, measurements uncertain.

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But on happy occasions, perfect conditions.

270
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The corona is studied and photographed

271
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
in the fullness of its glory.

272
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Music

273
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Your corona is most puzzling to us, Mr. Sun.

274
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We know that it rotates with you,

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
but at no two eclipses does it look just the same.

276
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It pulsates, changes shape,

277
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and at times extends out millions of miles.

278
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Why is that?

279
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Just one of the many things we still don't know about the Sun.

280
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Look, have we better tell him something we do know?

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Want to hear any more, Mr. Sun?

282
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I like your pictures of me.

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Got any more?

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh, yes, lots.

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Roll six.

286
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The camera's one of our main tools.

287
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Now, here's a normal picture of you taken by direct sunlight.

288
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's rather flat.

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Your face has little expression.

290
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But about 60 years ago,

291
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Dr. George Ellery Hale of America

292
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and Dr. Henri Delant of France

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
conceived this ingenious instrument

294
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
called the spectrogeliograph.

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It filters out all the light waves,

296
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
except the light from some particular glowing atom,

297
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
as for instance, hydrogen.

298
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Let's look at a normal white light picture of the Sun again.

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Now, here, taken at the same time,

300
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
is a spectrogeliogram that photographed

301
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
only the red light from glowing hydrogen atoms.

302
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Now, your face is interesting, reveals character.

303
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Here's another spectrogeliogram taken at the same time,

304
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
that photographed only the violet light

305
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
from incandescent calcium atoms,

306
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
which tells us even more about you.

307
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
With the spectrogeliograph,

308
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Dr. Robert R. McMath

309
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
of the McMath-Hulbert Observatory near Pontiac, Michigan

310
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
made the first time-lapse motion pictures

311
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
of the prominences and wrinkles on the face of the Sun.

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
From his pictures and from the many thousands of photographs

313
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
taken at observatories all over the world,

314
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
particularly at the Mount Wilson Observatory,

315
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
we've learned a great deal about Mr. Sun,

316
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
especially about those much-talked-of sunspots

317
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
that mystified Galileo.

318
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Ah, sunspots. There are such things, of course.

319
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, yeah.

320
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
They're not just something that scientists see when they're tired.

321
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh, they're very real, but very mysterious.

322
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
They mystified Galileo

323
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and through his original telescope,

324
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
he first saw them moving daily across the face of the Sun.

325
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And they've been mystifying us ever since.

326
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Spots can appear singly, like this one,

327
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
or in groups like these,

328
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and quite often in distinct pairs.

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
When photographed by red hydrogen light,

330
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
they look something like giant, violet tornadoes

331
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
seen from above.

332
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Spots range in size from mere pinpoints

333
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
just a few hundred miles across,

334
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
into which you could drop the British Isles,

335
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
to huge ones,

336
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
into which you could drop 100 planets as big as the Earth.

337
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Spots look dark, although they really aren't,

338
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
because they're cooler than the rest of the surface.

339
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
7,000 degrees is against 10,000 degrees of the surface.

340
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Also, over the years,

341
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
we notice a strange fluctuation in the number of spots,

342
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
increasing to a maximum, decreasing to a minimum,

343
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
in more or less regular 11-year cycles,

344
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
which many of us believe affect our weather,

345
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
our crops, and the growth of our trees.

346
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
One of the most astonishing mysteries

347
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
revealed by study of spots, Mr. Sun,

348
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
is that your equator, or the middle of you,

349
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
rotates faster than the rest of you.

350
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The middle rotates faster?

351
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes.

352
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
For instance, if a line of spots

353
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
were placed like runners at a starting line,

354
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
from the sun's north to the south pole,

355
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and a signal raced around the sun,

356
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
they would end up like this.

357
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Equator wins in 25 and one-third days.

358
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Half north and half south tie for second,

359
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
time 27 and a half days.

360
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Why is that?

361
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You don't know why, okay.

362
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Have you got any more pictures of me?

363
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Hey, would it please you to know, Mr. Glory Puss,

364
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
that you've been photographed

365
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
more than all the Hollywood stars put together?

366
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The most dramatic pictures, roll seven,

367
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
the most dramatic pictures are taken with a chronograph,

368
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
which creates automatic total eclipses

369
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
whenever the sun is shining.

370
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
This very remarkable instrument was first constructed

371
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
by Dr. Bernard Leo of France in 1930.

372
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Today, there are improved chronographs

373
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
at the High Altitude Observatory at Climax, Colorado,

374
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
under the direction of Dr. Walter Roberts,

375
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and at the Air Force installation

376
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
at Sacramento Peak, New Mexico,

377
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
presided over by Dr. J. W. Evans.

378
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The first user of the chronograph in America

379
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
was Dr. Donald H. Menzel of Harvard University.

380
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What happens in these red-hydrogen

381
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
chronograph motion pictures in one second

382
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
actually took place in about five minutes on the sun.

383
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The small sphere you see here

384
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
represents the size of the Earth in comparison with the sun.

385
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Your surface, Mr. Sun, is a stormy sea of violent motion.

386
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Small spicules or geysers like these

387
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
continually burst from blisters on the surface

388
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
and jet up like little fountains,

389
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
if you can call five or 10,000 miles up, little,

390
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
compare them to the size of the Earth.

391
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Big flame-like eruptions like these are called prominences.

392
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
They're vast clouds of gas that sometimes float idly

393
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
and other times shoot out at thousands of miles per minute

394
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
as if they'd ever heard of gravity.

395
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Sometimes they rise in graceful ribbons or tangle streamers.

396
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Beautiful, beautiful.

397
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Some surge up like gigantic geysers.

398
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Others flow sideways and downward,

399
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
at times forming natural bridges.

400
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Portions of the prominences may even break off

401
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and go floating away as in this picture.

402
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But the baffling part is that most prominences flow downward.

403
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Gases materializing from seemingly nowhere

404
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and flowing down into sunspot areas for days at a time.

405
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Coronal rain, it's sometimes called.

406
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Where does it come from?

407
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Of course, when it rains on Earth,

408
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
we don't actually see the rain go up either.

409
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
We only see it come down,

410
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
although we know it evaporates up from the seven seas.

411
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But where coronal rain comes from, we can only guess as yet.

412
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Given the whopper, Doc,

413
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
biggest solar explosion ever recorded

414
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
greatest photographic shot in history.

415
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
On June 4th, 1946,

416
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
a great arch of gas hundreds of times as big as the Earth

417
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
rose up at a speed of 400,000 miles per hour.

418
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And the arch expanded clear out of rains

419
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
of the instruments at climax in less than an hour and a half.

420
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I remember that one.

421
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Sure blew my top that day.

422
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yes, we heard you.

423
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Roll 15.

424
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You heard me.

425
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Oh, yes, we hear you every day.

426
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You not only send us light waves,

427
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
but you broadcast radio waves,

428
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
which we're able to pick up quite clearly

429
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
at special radio astronomy stations,

430
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
which receive radio signals from outer space.

431
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Here's a sample of the radio message you send us

432
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
on one of your noisier days.

433
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
In Australia, they've recently done some brilliant work

434
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
with radio astronomy.

435
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Dr. E. G. Bowen heads the group of radio astronomers.

436
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's only in the past few years

437
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
that we have discovered some strange things in the sky.

438
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Radio waves coming to us from many places in outer space.

439
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
In Australia, they've recently done some brilliant work

440
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
with radio astronomy.

441
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Dr. E. G. Bowen heads the group of radio astronomers.

442
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Radio astronomy is an outer space.

443
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Radio astronomy is a brand new exciting tool for scientists,

444
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and with it, we found out quite a bit about you, Mr. Sun,

445
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
through the noises you make.

446
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm beginning to feel like a goldfish.

447
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You got him going, doctor.

448
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Well, doesn't all this spouting and erupting

449
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
have some effect on the Earth?

450
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Oh, yes, tremendous out of there.

451
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Roll 8.

452
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Well, for instance, when a large flare

453
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
flashes up around the Sunspot area,

454
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
it immediately sends out a burst of powerful ultraviolet rays

455
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
that hit the Earth in 8 minutes.

456
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But it also sprays streams of slower electrified fragments of atoms

457
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
out into spaces if from a hose.

458
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
This solar spray of fine particles usually misses the Earth,

459
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
but at times the Earth is in its path.

460
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Now, the Earth is a magnet with north and south magnetic poles

461
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and a magnetic field around it.

462
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The spray of minute particles shot from the Sun,

463
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
which takes some 30 hours to reach the Earth,

464
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
is deflected toward the poles by the Earth's magnetic field.

465
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
As this solar dust, stardust, you might call it,

466
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
comes down into our atmosphere near the poles

467
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
and collides with air molecules,

468
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
it creates the most beautiful spectacle of the aurora,

469
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
also called the northern and southern lights.

470
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Dr. C.W. Gartline of Cornell University

471
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
took this unique time-lapse motion picture

472
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
of the actual aurora borealis.

473
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The Earth's rotation produces the apparent motion

474
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
of the stars in the background.

475
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But the effects of these ultraviolet bursts from the Sun

476
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
are not so beautiful.

477
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Voltage fluctuates, radio communications are disturbed,

478
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
and although our radio engineers have performed near miracles

479
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
in protecting our radio waves from this solar sniping,

480
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Dr. Rural 7C, sometimes this happens.

481
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
We take you now to London for a direct report from Sam Johnson.

482
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Come in, London.

483
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
This is Sam Johnson.

484
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
There's an air of tense expectancy here in London.

485
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
This morning, the prime minister...

486
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Will you stop playing with that radio?

487
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm not even trusted.

488
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But then do something!

489
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That was the momentous statement

490
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
the prime minister read to us this morning.

491
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And now, back to New York.

492
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
What an engineer!

493
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Wasn't the shoe? No, it wasn't the shoe.

494
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Let's recreate what actually happened

495
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
in terms of atmosphere and radio waves.

496
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Radio waves normally move in a straight line,

497
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
but about 50 miles high in our atmosphere,

498
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
there isn't a lot of light.

499
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But about 50 miles high in our atmosphere,

500
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
there's an electrified layer called the ionosphere

501
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
that reflects radio waves,

502
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
making it possible to bounce them around the Earth.

503
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Now let's listen to Sam Johnson again.

504
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
This is Sam Johnson.

505
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
There's an air of tense expectancy here in London.

506
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Suddenly a bright flare occurs on the sun.

507
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
First, the ultraviolet rays disrupts the ionosphere.

508
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
This morning, the prime minister announced...

509
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
But radio engineers are right on the ball.

510
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Bill, London's folding. Another SID, eh?

511
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yep.

512
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I've got another frequency ready for you.

513
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Not yet. Wait a minute.

514
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
An SID means a sudden ionospheric disturbance,

515
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
which is unpredictable.

516
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
But usually, in a matter of minutes,

517
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
the ionospheric layer reforms again.

518
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And that was the momentous statement

519
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
the prime minister read to us this morning.

520
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And now, back to New York.

521
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But when big regions of the sun are intensely active,

522
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
the spray of solar particles that causes the aurora

523
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
can disturb communications for hours, even days.

524
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But this type is predictable.

525
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Oh, yes. Fortunately, it usually is.

526
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And since radio communication is so vital to the services,

527
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
airlines, radio stations, telephone companies,

528
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
ships at sea,

529
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
recently observatories all over the world

530
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
have begun to keep watch on the sun

531
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and make up a worldwide radio warning service

532
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
at the High Altitude Observatory at Climax, Colorado,

533
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
at the Air Force Observatory at Sacramento Peak,

534
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
at Kota Canal, India,

535
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
in Japan,

536
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
in stations all over the globe,

537
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
observers keep tabs on you, Mr. Sun,

538
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and send in information to the Central Collecting Agencies,

539
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
such as the Radio Storm Warning Service

540
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
of the National Bureau of Standards,

541
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
where men under Alan Shapley analyze the data

542
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and try to predict when the solar storm

543
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
strikes the Earth, especially the vital

544
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
North Atlantic communication lines.

545
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Then, by radio, by teletype, by phone,

546
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
the warning goes out.

547
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Severe magnetic storm will affect North Atlantic circuits.

548
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Lower frequencies or use southern roots.

549
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
That's fine.

550
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But, Dr. Research,

551
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
what has puzzled you scientists most about the sun?

552
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Roll nine.

553
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Even I can give you that in one word.

554
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Energy.

555
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
This lady's parasol has one-and-one-half horsepower

556
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
of sunshine continually poured on it.

557
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Enough to run her washing machine, sewing machine,

558
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
refrigerator, and vacuum cleaner.

559
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
In full sunlight, our family car receives

560
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
almost enough sun power to run it,

561
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
if we only knew how to use solar energy directly.

562
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
At the common rate of two cents per kilowatt hour,

563
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
the sun sends the Earth $1 billion worth of energy

564
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
every second, and it's coming to us free.

565
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Five minutes' worth would pay our national debt.

566
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
One minute's worth of the energy that hits the Earth

567
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
would pay the total annual income tax

568
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
of all United States citizens.

569
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Oh, happy day.

570
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Yet what the Earth receives

571
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
is only a minute fraction of the whole,

572
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
only one part and two billion of the total solar energy.

573
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
The rest of the $500,000 billion-billion horsepower

574
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
goes out into space.

575
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
How does the sun generate this enormous amount of power,

576
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Dr. Research?

577
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yes, I don't eat, drink, or take vitamins.

578
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I never sleep or rest.

579
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Then how do I do it, brother scientist?

580
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Well, we know at least part of your secret now.

581
00:27:46,000 --> 00:28:10,000
MUSIC

582
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
We know the answer not only to your energy,

583
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
but to what makes other stars in the universe shine.

584
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Thermonuclear reaction.

585
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's the key word that wound up the universe.

586
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Thermonuclear.

587
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Eight to five, they've made a hydrogen bomb.

588
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
We certainly have, Mr. Sun.

589
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And the news rocked the world.

590
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But with you, it's old stuff.

591
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The equivalent of four billion hydrogen bombs

592
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
have been going off inside you every second

593
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
for some four billion years.

594
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Give or take a billion.

595
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
MUSIC

596
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
What smart guy figured that out?

597
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Dr. Hans Bethe of Cornell is the gentleman.

598
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
In 1938, he announced that the source of the sun's energy

599
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
is the fusion of 564 million tons of hydrogen

600
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
into 560 million tons of helium each second.

601
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
564 to 560, where did the missing 4 million tons go?

602
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Just disappear?

603
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Disappears as mass, as matter,

604
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
but reappears as light, heat, and all sorts of radiation.

605
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Quite a trickster, old Sol, making 4 million tons disappear.

606
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
4 million tons?

607
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
That he is.

608
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Roll 12.

609
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I brought along a trickster friend of mine,

610
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Thermo the magician, who has an act which he claims

611
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
explains the sun's magic.

612
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I am Thermo.

613
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I will do for you such a trick.

614
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Only me and the stars can do.

615
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Pay attention.

616
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
This is one way to make a hydrogen bomb.

617
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Nature's way.

618
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So, hydrogen.

619
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
One, two, three, four.

620
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
What is hydrogen?

621
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
The smallest atom from which you build all the other atoms.

622
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So, we will weigh the hydrogen.

623
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Scale.

624
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Each bottle weighs exactly 100 ounces.

625
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
For bottles, 400 ounces.

626
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Remember that.

627
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
400 ounces.

628
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So, now, carbon.

629
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
This is carbon.

630
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
A piece of coal for you.

631
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
That is what I start with.

632
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Hydrogen and carbon.

633
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So, now I will heat them.

634
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
30 million degrees, I will heat them.

635
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
How?

636
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Hydrogen bomb.

637
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It is done by exploding an ordinary atom bomb

638
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
to ignite the hydrogen bomb.

639
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But the stars, they do it by pressure.

640
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Gravity.

641
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Like our Mr. Sun.

642
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So, now I play Mr. Sun and heat the hydrogen

643
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and the carbon to 30 million degrees.

644
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Fire.

645
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Fire.

646
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Fire.

647
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Fire.

648
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Now I am ready.

649
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
One hydrogen, come.

650
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I thermal now give the command.

651
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Fusion.

652
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So, what have we here?

653
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Nitrogen.

654
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
The gas what makes four-fifths of the air you breathe.

655
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Air.

656
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Now, number two and number three hydrogen,

657
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
come.

658
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Fusion.

659
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Now we have oxygen.

660
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Another-fifth of the air you breathe.

661
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Number four.

662
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Fusion.

663
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Huh?

664
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Now we have coal again.

665
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Same piece.

666
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And we have helium.

667
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
What you feel ballooned with.

668
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Four hydrogens, if they are 30 million degrees hot,

669
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
30 million degrees.

670
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It is not children playing with matches.

671
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
The four hydrogens come out one helium.

672
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
The carbon comes back the same.

673
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You see, same way, no change.

674
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That's why we call this the carbon cycle.

675
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Now we weigh the helium.

676
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Should weigh 400 ounces like the hydrogen.

677
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Oh yes, naturally.

678
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But it can be.

679
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
The helium weighs three ounces less than the hydrogen.

680
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Where did the three ounces go?

681
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That is the magic of the stars.

682
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
That is the secret of the hydrogen bomb.

683
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I show you.

684
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Come back three ounces.

685
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Here is where they went.

686
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
They changed into...

687
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Now the energy in those three little ounces

688
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
that completely disappeared as matter,

689
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
that energy is enough to raise

690
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
the Empire State Building 2,500 miles high.

691
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Now the carbon cycle, which is what Thermo just explained to us,

692
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
is not the only way in which you can change hydrogen

693
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
into helium plus energy.

694
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You may also use a very special and rare process

695
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
in which you put two hydrogen atoms together directly.

696
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Is that the famous proton-proton process?

697
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
See, you've been reading.

698
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Mr. Son, you do not annihilate or destroy

699
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
just two or three ounces.

700
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
But four million tons of hydrogen matter each second.

701
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
That gives you your unbelievable energy,

702
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
which you radiate out into space.

703
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
We think that originally,

704
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
you were a great loose cloud of gas,

705
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
mostly hydrogen, being contracted by gravity.

706
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
As you were compressed, the temperature went up.

707
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Just as the air in a bicycle tire gets hotter and hotter

708
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
as you pump it.

709
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Finally, the temperature in your core

710
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
reached the necessary 30 million degrees

711
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
needed to trigger the thermonuclear reaction.

712
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Presto, the furnace was lit.

713
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Never to go out again as long as you live, Mr. Son.

714
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
The hydrogen began burning into helium and energy.

715
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Gravity tries to compress you.

716
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Burning hydrogen tries to expand you.

717
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
The two forces just balance each other.

718
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What's perfection itself?

719
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
A furnace made of its own fuel.

720
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
An immense, continuous hydrogen bomb

721
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
operating at an even heat for billions of years.

722
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
What a wonderful invention you are, Mr. Son.

723
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Which brings up a point.

724
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
How long before he runs out of this here now, hydrogen fuel?

725
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Oh, he still has about 98% of his fuel left.

726
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But 50, 100 billion years from now, Mr. Son,

727
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
you'll perhaps run out of fuel.

728
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You'll expire, go wherever good stars go.

729
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
We'll go with you because as you go, we go.

730
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You see, you're not just a big blob of hot mass to us.

731
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You're the head of our family.

732
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
We want to know more about you.

733
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
We depend on you for our very existence.

734
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Yes, in fact, we're depending on you heavily

735
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
for the solution of two of man's biggest problems.

736
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Well, at last I'm being appreciated.

737
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
What did you say your name was?

738
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Dr. Research, your big...

739
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
What are those two big problems you spoke of, Dr. Research?

740
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
The first is the age-old problem of food.

741
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Roll five.

742
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And boy, the number of miles that need food keeps increasing.

743
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
In 1650, after 25,000 years of man,

744
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
our population had reached half a billion.

745
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
By 1950, only 300 years later,

746
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
the population climbed to two and one half billion,

747
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
five times as many.

748
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Out of all human beings who ever lived,

749
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
one out of 20 is alive today.

750
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
One out of 20? Alive today?

751
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Isn't that amazing?

752
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
We never had food enough for all in the past.

753
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
We don't have enough for all today.

754
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Two out of every three persons on Earth

755
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
naturally eat below the minimum necessary for health.

756
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Yet 100 million new babies are born every year.

757
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
A yearly baby crop nearly equal to the population

758
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
of all of South America.

759
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And all born hungry.

760
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Yes, our population's practically exploding.

761
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I bet he doesn't know who grows his food for him.

762
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Oh, yeah, we know quite a bit about that.

763
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
That is he does.

764
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Roll four.

765
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Our food is grown by a natural process called photosynthesis,

766
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
which means putting together with light, your light,

767
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
the oldest, biggest and most important manufacturing operation in the world.

768
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
99% of all our food and fuel is created by photosynthesis,

769
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
a process that goes on only in plants, never in animals.

770
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
On every green leaf, there are millions of

771
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
sub-microscopic little one-man factories

772
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
turning out more sugar than all the ships and railroads in the world could carry.

773
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And the head man of each factory is a little green molecule called chlorophyll,

774
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
the only engineer with a know-how about this still secret life process.

775
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Chlorophyll is so small and so secretive

776
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
that not even the most powerful microscopes can spy on him.

777
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Here's the way we think he works.

778
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The veins of the leaf bring him water from the roots.

779
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
From the air, he grabs a molecule of carbon dioxide, CO2.

780
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
He puts a water molecule and a carbon dioxide molecule together.

781
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Then he reaches for a piece of sunlight,

782
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
and this is what we don't quite know how he adds this sunlight.

783
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And I'm not going to tell you either.

784
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You can darn well find out for yourself.

785
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Quiet.

786
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Piece by piece, he adds more sunlight to his sugarcane.

787
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Then he pulls out an oxygen atom from the mixture and releases it into the air.

788
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And the Russians didn't invent me either.

789
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I invented myself.

790
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Then he takes some sauce that come up in the veins,

791
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
sprinkles them over the mixture for icing,

792
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
and puts the completed sugar cake into a waiting artery.

793
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Out of this sugar or sunshine cake,

794
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
the tree makes leaves, trunk, roots, and fruit.

795
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
In the sea, chlorophyll produces even more food than he does on land.

796
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The whole surface of the seas is teeming with billions of tons of a minute,

797
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
single-cell vegetable called phytoplankton.

798
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
These in turn are eaten by countless, almost invisible little animals called zooplankton.

799
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Which are eaten by little fish.

800
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Which are eaten by bigger fish.

801
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Which are eaten by still bigger fish.

802
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Yes, all fish are ultimately made of chlorophyll sunshine cake.

803
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And when we catch them and can them, we're catching and canning sunlight.

804
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
In fact, all animals feed on sunshine cake in one form or another.

805
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
The energy the junior gets from milk was in a contented cow 24 hours ago.

806
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
24 hours before that, the same energy was in clover,

807
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
which had absorbed it from sunlight that had come 93 million miles in eight minutes

808
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
from the surface of the sun,

809
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
but had taken 20 million years to find its way to the surface from the sun's central furnace.

810
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So you see the energy that makes junior run,

811
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
that makes a porpoise leap,

812
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
and makes me talk so much.

813
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
That energy is hydrogen that burned in your central furnace

814
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
long, long before man walked the earth.

815
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
You know, brother research, I'm beginning to like you.

816
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Do all the people know these things about me?

817
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
No, that's why this program.

818
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
What's the big hitch in the food problem?

819
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
For one thing, chlorophyll is too slow.

820
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Take any acre of forest or vegetables.

821
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
The amount of sunshine converted to plant food

822
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
averages only two tons of vegetable matter per year.

823
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But if all the lights you send us could be used by chlorophyll,

824
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
we could raise 2,000 tons of food per acre per year.

825
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
A little chlorophyll may know the big secret, but he's awfully inefficient.

826
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh, who's inefficient?

827
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I just make sugar.

828
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Can I help it? It's so silly. Please build a trunk soon.

829
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Branches and roots out of it, but you can't eat.

830
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What you're looking for is a plant that's all fruit.

831
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Oh, there is such a plant.

832
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Oh, edible, too.

833
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And it multiplies faster than rabbits.

834
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
But you scientists are too dumb to find it.

835
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
There you are, Mr. Man. Find the plant.

836
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Oh, we found it already, Mr. Son.

837
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Roll ten.

838
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Found it in freshwater lakes.

839
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
A kind of green algae called chlorella,

840
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
a tiny one-celled plant that has learned the mathematical trick

841
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
of multiplying by dividing.

842
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Each cell gives birth to from four to 16 daughter cells,

843
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
which all grow up and repeat the process.

844
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Chlorella contains fats, carbohydrates, and up to 50% proteins,

845
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
and is all edible.

846
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
All fruit is, Mr. Chlorell would say.

847
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
All over the world, scientists are doing research on chlorella.

848
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
In Japan, Dr. Hiroshi Tamia of the Tokugawa Institute

849
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
has done some of the most interesting and practical work.

850
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
For there, food is definitely a problem.

851
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Into these troughs, water containing chlorella cultures is pumped.

852
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Nutrient salts are added.

853
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
The troughs are covered with plastic sheeting to let in sunlight

854
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
while extra carbon dioxide is bubbled into the solution.

855
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
When the culture becomes intensely green,

856
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
the chlorella crop is harvested.

857
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
After washing and drying, the fine powder looks like green flour.

858
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Mrs. Tamia, wife of the director, has added this to regular flour

859
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
and made excellent biscuits and cakes out of it.

860
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
If these processes ever become practical,

861
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
underfed populations may have a new, rich source of food.

862
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Yes, indeed.

863
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
An acre of chlorella can convert sunlight into some 20 tons of plant matter

864
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
against one or two tons of an ordinary crop.

865
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But there's a second great problem facing us eventually.

866
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
For thousands of years, we got our fuel from burning wood.

867
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Sun power, Mr. Sun stored up in trees.

868
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Next, we put animals to work.

869
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Sun power from grass.

870
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Then came educated power to do work animals couldn't be taught to do.

871
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Human slave power to build roads, pyramids and row ships.

872
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Sun power with brains.

873
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But slaves had to be fed.

874
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So we discovered power that didn't eat, like windmills and water wheels.

875
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
The machine age was born.

876
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
But modern machines need to be fed too, fed with fuels.

877
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Where do we get the fuels?

878
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
From the big fuel man himself.

879
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Over the ages, Mr. Sun was kind enough to store them up for him.

880
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Chomp for living sunshine.

881
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Thing for fossil sunshine.

882
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Drill for liquid sunshine.

883
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Dams for silent sunshine.

884
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Fuel.

885
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Fuel.

886
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
More fuel.

887
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
How much fuel is in the bank?

888
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
How big is the trust fund the old boy left us?

889
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Roll 13.

890
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Well, suppose all our energy had been deposited

891
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
in the Sun power bank incorporated,

892
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
founded millions of years ago with assets unlimited.

893
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
In 1850, each American for instance,

894
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
withdrew enough fuel from the fuel bank

895
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
to generate 400 horsepower hours for himself.

896
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
But nobody worried too much about it.

897
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Our assets still appeared unlimited.

898
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
In 1950, each American withdrew 10,000 horsepower hours

899
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
from Sun power incorporated,

900
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
while atomic scientists were making some minor deposits.

901
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
This began to worry us.

902
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Our assets were becoming definitely limited.

903
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
By 1975, we'll probably be able to do something

904
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,000
but by 1975, we'll probably withdraw 20,000 horsepower hours each.

905
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Atomic energy fuel deposits will stave off the run for some time,

906
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
but there's only so much uranium and thorium in the world,

907
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
and that will go too.

908
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
When the principal's gone, you're going to have to live on your income, huh?

909
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
But our income is only about 10% of our power spending.

910
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
We need help.

911
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Every day I send you a thousand times more power

912
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
than you use in a year.

913
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It's up to you, fellows.

914
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Anybody working on getting power direct from old blowhard here?

915
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Oh, yes, but not nearly enough.

916
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Roll six feet.

917
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Some years ago, Dr. Charles Greeley Abbott,

918
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
an enthusiastic pioneer in solar engines,

919
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
designed this vacuum-jacketed boiler tube

920
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
at the focus of a parabolic mirror,

921
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
which will convert sunlight to engine power.

922
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Today, the French laboratory of solar energy

923
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
has an enormous solar furnace at Mont Louis

924
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
for metal research at high temperatures.

925
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
In India, Dr. S. Batnagar,

926
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
the famous Indian scientist,

927
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
experimented with solar cookers for home use.

928
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
On one of these cookers,

929
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
an Indian family can cook its noonday meal

930
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
with no heat other than the sun's heat.

931
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Some other ways depend on glass.

932
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Sunlight coming through a window,

933
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
heats up everything in the room,

934
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
but heat radiated back from furniture and floor

935
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
is long heat waves,

936
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
which the window glass stops from going back out,

937
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
thus trapping the sun's heat.

938
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Is that why greenhouses covered with glass

939
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
are warmer inside than the air outside?

940
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Right.

941
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
That's why your closed car gets so unbearably hot

942
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
standing out in the sun.

943
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Dr. Maria Telkis has designed a model house in Massachusetts

944
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
in which solar heat is ingeniously collected,

945
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
stored, and distributed throughout the whole house.

946
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Now, these are more or less well-known mechanical ways

947
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
of using sun power directly.

948
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
There's exciting research going on with some brand new ways.

949
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
You think Mr. Clarifill was pretty smart

950
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
with his tricky sunshine cake

951
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
that makes food out of your sunlight?

952
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Well, the science boys have come up with a sunshine cake

953
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
that makes electricity out of your sunlight.

954
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Oh, yes. You mean the solar battery?

955
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
That's hardly even a cookie yet, let alone a cake.

956
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Doc, that's big news.

957
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Well, it was the solar battery.

958
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Now, held in the sun, this thin little cell,

959
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
a sunshine wafer we might call it,

960
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
produces a usable amount of electric current

961
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
out of the sunlight that falls on it.

962
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
It was cooked up out of basic research

963
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
at the Bell Telephone Lab by three scientists,

964
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Darrell Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson.

965
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
You know, although this is quite expensive at the moment,

966
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
the simplicity of this sunshine wafer is startling.

967
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
What bake one for a glory, Puss Doc?

968
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I'd be delighted.

969
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Look at him. Oh, pastry cook research.

970
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
The recipe for this solar wafer

971
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
sounds just like a vacation.

972
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Just sand and sunshine.

973
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Thank you, son.

974
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Ah!

975
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Plain old sand is composed of silicon and oxygen.

976
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
It's time to go to meeting name as silicon dioxide.

977
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Separate out the oxygen and the bits of seaweed,

978
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
bottle tops, and other odds and ends.

979
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And we have left a metal silicon.

980
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Ah, but our silicon must be pure silicon.

981
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,000
So we purify it, and purify it until it's as pure as the driven snow.

982
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Now melt the silicon,

983
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
and add just a pinch of arsenic for flavor.

984
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Mix thoroughly.

985
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Then cool until it crystallizes.

986
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Then from the arsenic flavored silicon roll,

987
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
slice off a razor thin wafer.

988
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Put the wafer into the oven.

989
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Fill oven with a boron gas,

990
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
and bake the white heat.

991
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
The boron cooks into the surface, forms an extremely thin icing over the wafer.

992
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Remove finished wafer.

993
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Connect one wire from electric motor to boron icing,

994
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and the other wire to the wafer itself.

995
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Expose wafer to sunlight.

996
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Presto!

997
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
The motor starts running with the efficiency of an automobile,

998
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and nothing is used up but the sunshine, which is free.

999
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Is that something?

1000
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Well, I'll be darned.

1001
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
So you see in a solar battery,

1002
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
it's energy from the sun that moves the electricity,

1003
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
which in turn rotates motors.

1004
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
It's energy from the sun that moves the electricity.

1005
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
It's energy from the sun that moves the electricity.

1006
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It's energy from the sun that moves the electricity.

1007
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It's energy from the sun that moves the electricity.

1008
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Or as in this case,

1009
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
powers rural telephone lines by charging storage batteries.

1010
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
But the solar battery isn't all.

1011
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
There's other important research in changing sunlight into power.

1012
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Dr. E. I. Rabinowitz has put together a chemical cell

1013
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
that'll change light waves into electric current.

1014
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
But storing sun power for night use

1015
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
is a big part of this energy from the sun problem.

1016
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Well, Dr. Lawrence J. Height of MIT

1017
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
is experimenting with a process

1018
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
in which sunlight decomposes water back into oxygen and hydrogen,

1019
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
the hydrogen being a storable fuel.

1020
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Another possibility.

1021
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Phosphors are chemical powders that absorb sunlight

1022
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
and can give it back slowly in the dark.

1023
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I read where Westinghouse engineers predict a wallpaper

1024
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
containing phosphors which will absorb daylight during the day,

1025
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
then glow for hours after dark.

1026
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
A city painted with phosphor paint of the future might glow all night.

1027
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
These are some of the processes

1028
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
that are being researched on a small scale today, Mr. Sun.

1029
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
But our engineers can't turn the wheels of industry on little wafers.

1030
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
They'll have to build efficient generators

1031
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
that spread out over acres, even square miles,

1032
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
to compete with the cheap, cold, and oil still available to us.

1033
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And the doctor, what about atomic power?

1034
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Oh, great hopes for it, of course.

1035
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Especially now, since atomic plants can make their own fuel

1036
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
with so-called breeder reactors.

1037
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Some even dream of imitating the stars,

1038
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
getting power from hydrogen fusion.

1039
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
But if dreams fail, the answer must be sun power from our Mr. Sun.

1040
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
What if you don't find ways to use my free sunshine for fuel?

1041
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Then the machine age is over.

1042
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
We'll have to go back to muscle power

1043
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
and the half-billion population that muscle power alone can support.

1044
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
But that will never happen.

1045
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Oh, no, why not?

1046
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Because man's greatest power source is his mind.

1047
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
God gave him that, not you.

1048
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Without taking a step, he can travel faster and farther than any animal.

1049
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Without even getting wet, he can out-swim any fish.

1050
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Without a fell on him, he can fly faster and higher

1051
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
and farther than any eagle.

1052
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
He can send his eyes and ears hundreds of miles into space

1053
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
where he's never even been.

1054
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And his pride opened the secret of the atom,

1055
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
which he's never even seen.

1056
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
When his fuel's run low,

1057
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
man's mind and imagination will meet the challenge

1058
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
and invent undreamed of ways to use the free sunlight

1059
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
God showers down upon him.

1060
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Just remember, somebody must love you very much.

1061
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
That planet that you live on is not like all the rest.

1062
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
You're blessed with just the right size,

1063
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
the right temperature, the right atmosphere,

1064
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
the right composition.

1065
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Everything just right to produce the biggest miracle of all.

1066
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Life.

1067
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So go ahead, ask, inquire, seek the truth.

1068
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's right that you should know

1069
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
or the good Lord wouldn't have given you that driving curiosity.

1070
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Measure the outside with mathematics,

1071
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
but measure the inside with prayer.

1072
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Prayer is researched to study man as well as the world.

1073
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So keep on pitching.

1074
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
The best is yet to come for you.

1075
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I predict man's next great adventure will be the sun age.

1076
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
When that happens, you'll be rich beyond all dreams.

1077
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I predict great sun cities built on desert wastelands

1078
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
where everything is run by sunlight.

1079
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I predict...

1080
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Oh, sure, that's fine.

1081
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
But suppose I begin cutting up, then what?

1082
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
You won't.

1083
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
But if you did, man has migrated many times before

1084
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
and he'll do it again if he has to.

1085
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
If you make it too hot for him on Earth,

1086
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
man is capable of conceiving a way to move the whole kitten

1087
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
to bootle the greener pastures on some other planet.

1088
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Oh, no, we like it here.

1089
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Don't change on us, Mr. Sun.

1090
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
We used to worship you as an unknown god.

1091
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
But now that we know you better,

1092
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
we love you as our great and good friend.

1093
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
So keep on shining, Mr. Sun.

1094
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Thanks for all the radiant riches you showered down upon us.

1095
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Thanks for our eyes and all the glories we behold.

1096
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Thanks for all the green forests,

1097
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
the great deposit of black dimes,

1098
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
the deep pools of liquid gold you put in the bank for us.

1099
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Thanks for the wheat fields,

1100
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
all the fruits and flowers you grow for us.

1101
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Thanks for feeding our animals,

1102
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
our birds, our insects,

1103
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
all the fish in the sea.

1104
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And thanks especially for the glory and beauty of your good mornings

1105
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
and your good evenings

1106
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
and the words of St. Francis.

1107
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Be praised, my Lord, in what you have created.

1108
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Above all else, be praised in our brother, Master Sun.

1109
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Good night, brotherhood.

1110
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Now you're hooking the sunshine.

1111
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
The Bell Telephone System takes pride in bringing you this program

1112
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
in its series of shows on science.

1113
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
We wish to express our gratitude

1114
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
to the distinguished board of advisors

1115
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
who guide the choice and treatment of scientific matter for the series.

1116
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
For the program you have just seen,

1117
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
our thanks to the special advisors

1118
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
who have suggested and checked the scientific material.

1119
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
The Bell Telephone System is indebted to all these men

1120
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
and to many institutions

1121
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
for the generous support they have given this venture

1122
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
in public education through entertainment.
