0	3760	This will be a lecture looking at a whole lot of the themes we've been
3760	8400	considering all quarter in here, how they apply to a topic that is very close to
8400	13040	home. And what I already know from some of the emails today was Friday's
13040	16740	lecture, looking at depression, was already getting close to home. Some of the
16740	20920	themes that came out at the end of the chaos lecture, some of the notions
20920	25720	there that some of the stuff teaching us, perhaps there are no blueprints,
25720	29640	perhaps there need not be blueprints, perhaps there may still be blueprints
29680	33360	despite a theoretical demonstration that you don't need them hitting close to
33360	37520	home also, that is what all of today's lecture is about, looking at some
37520	43480	biological underpinnings of religiosity. And this one is far and away from the
43480	48560	lecture I am most nervous for, simply because this one people wind up having
48560	53040	strong opinions about, and I want to navigate through this one as successfully
53040	56200	as possible. Okay, just to give me a sense of where I'm starting off from here,
56280	61880	how many of you would characterize yourself as religious, as fairly
61880	68560	religious, as highly religious? Okay, good. How many of you would characterize
68560	73960	yourself as very, very comfortably, exceptingly non-religious? Lots of
73960	78200	hands there as well. Okay, lots of potential differences in responding to
78200	82360	this. Where we pick up on is from where we left off with a lecture last
82360	86360	Wednesday, which was the schizophrenia lecture. And where we finished with was
86360	89680	this whole notion that by now we have to have dealt with every single one of
89680	93120	these topics, starting on the far right, what's the behavior look like, and
93120	97400	eventually getting to the far left, what are the evolutionary roots? And what has
97400	101160	always been the rationale for that is the second we're looking at anything with
101160	106440	genes, genetic influences, genetic hints, genetic whatever, we're asking where
106440	110360	these genes come from, where's the evolutionary sense, where's the adaptive
110400	114280	value for anything we're looking at? How would a sociobiologist interpret it
114280	115480	to someone else? Yeah, question?
121800	126600	I should be, and I don't think I understand the subject enough to know. Other
126600	130480	than something about religiosity is done in a social context, and that's going
130480	135520	to become important here. And the difference is one that puzzles me a
135520	139000	great deal, because it clearly transcends issues of just the social
139000	144120	community, but that seems to be a good defining point to start from. Okay, so
144120	147480	where we ended up there with was this puzzle. We finished at the end of
147480	151600	depression looking at evolutionary aspects and looking at there may be some
151600	155600	hidden benefits, that weird argument in one of the readings in your reader
155600	160040	creativity and aspects of manic depression going hand in hand, but we were
160040	163720	left with somewhat of a puzzle at the end of the schizophrenia lecture. Why
163720	167040	might there have been selection for these genes? Because once again, we start
167080	171080	off with a theme from the very beginning. Ooh, genes being selected for. Why
171080	175200	did the giraffe have long necks? Because this is a trait that's adaptive. In our
175200	180040	Darwinian terms, this is a trait that's associated with leaving more copies of
180040	184800	your genes. In future generations, what is the adaptive value for genes for
184800	188520	schizophrenia? Because we looked at the fact that in this contemporary form,
188520	193760	schizophrenia is by definition a maladaptive trait. Schizophrenics leave
193760	198120	fewer copies of their genes than their unaffected siblings. It is a trait which
198120	203000	is formally maladaptive. What might be a hidden advantage lurking there? And
203000	207160	where we left at the very end of that was just a hint that, in fact, as far as
207160	211080	anyone can tell, there are no hidden advantages to schizophrenia. There may
211080	215560	not be any adaptive advantage. What I left you with there was the notion,
215560	219840	however, that there might be another disease lurking around related to
219880	224680	schizophrenia, which does have an adaptive advantage. And to begin here, what we
224680	229200	have to go back to is one of the basic ninth grade biology concepts in science
229200	233360	there, which is the whole notion that, some of the time, a genetic trait, which
233360	238320	is god-awful in one setting, may have some advantages elsewhere. And we all
238320	242400	learned the exact same example back in ninth grade, sickle cell anemia. Sickle
242400	246480	cell anemia, which in one context, when fully expressed, is a hematological
246480	251600	disaster. Absolutely bad news, horrible. And in other settings, can protect you
251600	255600	against malaria and not by chance that versions of sickle cell anemia have
255600	260680	evolved in sub-Saharan Africa, Mediterranean areas, Thalassemia related
260680	265160	diseases, that this has been a frequent solution. Also in passing, showing us one
265160	269200	of the truisms from this class, there's no such thing as a bad gene. There's only
269200	274280	a bad gene environment interaction. Okay, so this theme in medical genetics comes
274320	279360	through a lot of times. Genetic traits, which in one setting are bad news, may
279360	283560	have advantages in another setting. And it's turning out, this is a theme in
283560	288880	lots of different realms of genetics. Other examples, Tay-Sachs disease. Tay-Sachs,
288880	293200	horrible congenital disorder, predominantly found in Ashkenazi Jews. What you
293200	297640	wind up getting there is full-blown version, complete cortical failure to
297640	302720	develop. A child is massively retarded and birth dies shortly afterward. Partial
302720	307320	version of Tay-Sachs disease and you're resistant to tuberculosis. Nobody knows
307320	311200	the mechanism for it yet. People absolutely understand why the sickle cell
311200	315880	trait both sets you up for an anemia and protection from malaria. Nobody
315880	320160	understands it yet with Tay-Sachs, but this explains one of the phenomena back
320160	325560	from the Middle Ages, the European belief that Jews were safe from tuberculosis
325560	329720	because they were poisoning the Christian wells. And that was a cause of a large
329720	334480	number of programs back when there is a genetic explanation, which is the trait
334480	338520	for Tay-Sachs disease in this partially expressed form protects from
338520	344120	tuberculosis. More examples of this. Cystic fibrosis, the most common congenital
344120	347720	disorder these days, and that is massively life-threatening.
347720	351720	A copy finished, so I would need a code to make a...
351720	357720	A code. Anybody know a code?
358720	364720	By Wednesday. Do you have no where the handout is?
364720	366720	They're not Xerox.
366720	368720	Are they sitting there though?
368720	373320	Cystic fibrosis, full-blown version disastrous disease. What you get in
373320	379120	cystic fibrosis is inflammatory disease. Your lungs fill up with fluid. You often
379120	384280	are dead by age 20. Horrible disease. Partial version of cystic fibrosis and you
384280	388600	are protected against cholera. And the exact same mechanism that causes an
388600	392680	imbalance of fluids in the lungs is the same mechanism that keeps you from
392680	397640	losing all your fluids when you have cholera of dehydrating, highly adaptive.
397640	403160	A theme that keeps popping up over and over. Full-blown version, bad news, partial
403160	407840	genetic version, good news. And what you wind up getting is this basic argument,
407840	411800	a numerical argument, very similar to the, I'll lay down my life for two
411800	415440	brothers or eight cousins deal, of if you've got enough people with the
415440	421120	partial protective adaptive version, you can afford the occasional cousin with
421120	426560	the full-blown version. The trait overall will still be passed on. Now what this
426560	430120	sets us up for is thinking about whether something like this is going on with
430120	435280	schizophrenia. And the question to ask of course is, what is a mild genetic version
435280	440080	of schizophrenia? And this one got discovered in the 1970s. Back to that
440080	442920	classic study we've heard about in a couple of different lectures by now,
442920	447840	Kedi, that psychiatrist from Harvard, who with his colleagues went off to Denmark
447840	452080	and spent a decade there looking at every single adoption case and looking at
452080	455920	the patterns of schizophrenia, the schizophrenic, the adoptive parents, the
455920	460400	biological parents. In the course of them doing this, they discovered something
460400	463200	amazing. Because think about what these guys did. This was this team of
463200	468560	psychiatrists who spent a decade in Denmark. What they did was interview every
468560	474040	single family of every adoptee in Denmark. This was like 10,000 people. This
474040	478680	was a massive amount of work looking for schizophrenics, looking in the various
478680	482960	pedigrees, all that sort of thing, interviewing huge numbers of people,
482960	486760	just a handful of these folks, so they would all get the diagnostic criteria
486760	491360	fairly similar. Well-designed study, blah blah. What had they done by the end of a
491360	496520	decade? They had talked to more family members of schizophrenics than any
496520	501080	psychiatrists in history. And think about this. Your average psychiatrist who's
501080	505560	got some schizophrenic patients will, you know, meet once every six months with
505560	509720	the parent. If the schizophrenic is on the young side, maybe occasionally will
509720	514320	also have sessions on a regular basis. These people had just interviewed tens of
514320	518600	thousands of family members of schizophrenics. And they noticed something
518600	523520	interesting. They noticed that on the average, there was something a little bit
523520	528400	strange about family members of schizophrenics. Not all of them, and these
528400	532880	traits are not only found amongst family members of schizophrenics, but at a
532880	537760	higher than expected rate, there is a weird sort of quirky personality that
537760	542720	went with family members of schizophrenics, biological family members. And this
542720	548080	version of a much milder case of schizophrenia is now called schizotypal
548080	552400	personality. This is a standardly recognized disorder in psychiatry,
552640	558960	schizotypalism is a mild genetic version of schizophrenia. What does schizotypal
558960	565120	look like? First off, people have somewhat loose associations, not remotely in the
565120	569040	realm of a schizophrenic, and there are standardized scales that can be given to
569040	573040	show this is someone out of the normal range, but not in the schizophrenic range
573040	578480	in an intermediate range. In addition, you get a social withdrawal. And this is
578480	582640	not the complete dysfunctional, unable to hold down a job locked up in the back
582640	586080	of the village version of schizophrenia. This is someone instead who just
586080	591840	gravitates towards fairly solitary occupations. This is the lighthouse keeper,
591840	597120	this is the fire tower watcher, this is the classic schizotypal occupation,
597120	600880	this is the person sitting alone in the projection room in the movie theater
600880	605440	eight hours a night in the dark there, classic sort of schizotypal jobs,
605440	611120	socially detached, very solitary. The most striking feature of schizotypals
611120	616240	is what is termed metamagical thinking. And this is where things begin to get
616240	620800	interesting. Metamagical thinking, this is not someone who is thought disordered,
620800	625120	psychotic, unable to function, this is someone who just kind of believes in
625120	630400	strange things. This is someone who's really, really into science fiction and fantasy.
631040	635840	This is someone, okay, I see some of the concern popping up here. This is someone
635840	641200	who's into some sort of new age stuff in a really frenzy sort of way. This is
641200	646640	someone who believes in mental telepathy or UFOs. This is a first hint. This is
646640	651200	someone who, if they have a religious structure of belief, has an extremely
651200	656800	concrete level of interpretation. Remembering this seems to be quite similar
656800	661280	to schizophrenia, what apples oranges have in common multi-syllabic words,
661280	665200	that concreteness at the level of abstraction. These are people who tend
665200	671200	towards extremely fundamentalist, concrete interpretations of religious events.
671200	675520	Seven-day creation of the world, this is not a metaphor, this is not a parable,
675520	680000	this could be measured down to the minute. People alive who were once dead,
680000	684720	this is not a metaphor for keeping the spirit going. This is an exact description
684800	689680	of the events we begin to see where we're heading here. What schizotypillism is
689680	695040	about is it's a very mild version of schizophrenia in terms of the loose
695040	699200	associations, in terms of the concreteness of associations, the social
699200	703520	detachment, and most of all the metamagical thinking. This is now a
703520	708880	standard diagnostic category in psychiatry to have a schizotypal personality.
709600	715120	So, what we then ask is, where does this come from? What is this like? And what we
715120	718400	have to ask is of course our usual question when trying to make sense of
718400	723760	a human trait is recognizing 99% of human history was not spent with schizotypills
723760	728080	being able to get jobs in film projection rooms. What does schizotypillism look
728080	733200	like in traditional non-westernized human societies? And the answer to that
733200	738640	turns out to have been floating around for 60, 70 years in the anthropology literature.
738640	742960	And this is back to the 1930s. An anthropologist named Paul Raiden, who was
742960	746560	the first one to point this out, was the first one of a whole tradition
746560	750720	emphasizing what was a pretty strong area of research in the 1940s in
750720	754480	anthropology. He was the first person who pointed out that in
754480	759600	traditional human societies, there is a category of people there who count as,
759600	764800	and these are his exact words, half crazy. Who are the half crazies in
764800	769680	traditional human society? The shamans, the witch doctors, the
769680	773120	medicine men, the medicine women. These are members of
773120	777440	society who make a living being metamagical. And
777440	781920	Raiden was the first one to emphasize this. In traditional human societies,
781920	786960	the shamans are the ones who converse with the dead for ritualistic reasons. The
786960	791200	shamans are the ones who speak in tongues. The shamans are the ones who
791280	795520	at the full moon turn into the hyena to protect the village from predators.
795520	799840	The shamans are the ones who are metamagical for a thing, for a living.
799840	803200	And this has been a theme in anthropology for quite some time.
803200	807040	One anthropologist named Akternek referred to
807040	811840	shamans as being healed madmen. In the 1940s, anthropologists named
811840	815200	Krober, who started the Anthra Department in Berkeley and was one of the
815200	818560	grand old men in the field. This is a quote of his describing what
818560	822480	shamanism is about. The shaman displays his possession by
822480	825440	a spirit by publicly reenacting his specific
825440	829360	personal experience, that of a man suffering from a particular mental
829360	832720	affliction. His projections, his hallucinations,
832720	836800	his journey through space and time thus became a dramatic ritual
836800	840000	and served as the prototype for all future concepts
840000	844800	of the religious road of perfection. And this was the recognition in the 30s and
844800	848880	40s that what shamanism is about is a very controlled,
848880	854000	very socially contextual version of metamagical schizotypillism.
854000	856640	The word did not exist in the field at the time,
856640	861120	but that is what it is. Now what Krober emphasized in his writing was
861120	865040	these are not schizophrenics. And what we heard about in that story in
865040	868800	class four days ago, looking at that schizophrenic
868800	872400	person in that messiah village, is that people in traditional human
872400	875280	societies are no more tolerant to the mentally ill
875280	879040	than we are in the West and just as delighted to find cultural means
879040	882960	to peripheralize them, these are not full-blown schizophrenics.
882960	886400	These are not people who suddenly are speaking in tongues
886400	890560	at the exact silent moment in the hunt. These are people who are speaking in
890560	894400	tongues at the right time. These are people who are hearing voices
894400	898080	at the right time and you remember what the punchline was of that story
898080	901200	about that schizophrenic woman in that messiah village was
901200	906080	she heard voices at the wrong time. Hearing voices at the right time
906080	910000	is not schizophrenia, it is a version of schizotypillism.
910000	914240	And what you see when you look at the human tradition of shamanism,
914240	918080	these are not peripheralized people. These are some of the most powerful
918080	921200	members of society. Many societies have a tradition
921200	925440	of shamans being celibate, but many of them, most of them as it turns out,
925440	928400	do not. And these are people who are anything but
928400	932160	reproductively maladaptive. These are people who have been passing on their
932160	936400	genes just fine throughout history. Shamanism, this mild
936400	939360	version, this contextually appropriate version of
939360	943520	metamagicalism has done wonderfully throughout human history.
943520	947600	And a great example of that, the fact that you need to get it just right,
947600	951760	was Krober sort of emphasizing this, that in the right setting,
951760	955360	what would be an absolutely peripheralizing set of traits
955360	958880	instead makes you a very powerful, very sanctioned,
958880	963040	and that's the word that he used, a very sanctioned member of society,
963040	966480	and it's not for nothing that the word sanction has a whole lot to do with the
966480	969840	word sanctuary. This is a realm in which the exact same
969840	974160	traits would spectacularly fail to work in other cultural settings,
974160	978400	do it right, and it works just fine. And Krober had a wonderful anecdote about
978400	981360	this, this sense of you got to get it just right.
981360	985760	He apparently was at some ritual, a ceremony, he spent most of his time
985760	988480	doing his anthropology with Native American groups,
988480	992720	and this was some ceremony being done by the Winnebago's, and I was actually
992720	996080	found it quite bizarre that there was a group called the Winnebago,
996080	999040	but hanging out with the Winnebago's, and this was one of his
999040	1003040	informants there sort of explaining this ritual, and this was apparently some
1003040	1007280	really fraughty, really quite over-the-top ritual that the Shaman was
1007280	1011280	pulling off and was speaking in tongues and rolling on the fire, and all of that
1011360	1015360	and this guy said, that is great, we've got this Shaman here, this guy is
1015360	1018240	like the best, he's worth every dollar we pay him,
1018240	1021840	this guy is terrific, we are so lucky to have a Shaman like this in our village,
1021840	1024880	this guy is, thank god we don't have two of them though,
1024880	1030560	two way too much, one's just fine, and you have this recognition that
1030560	1034000	this is not schizophrenia, you wouldn't want a person to be
1034000	1037920	schizophrenic because they will be as peripheralized as in our own society,
1037920	1040800	you want to get it just right, you don't want to have too many of them,
1040800	1044720	you've got to have some people who are some plain meat and potatoes, good hunters,
1044720	1047760	that sort of thing, and you want the ratio of that to the Shamanistic
1047760	1052400	metamagical folks to be quite high, but you need a few of them around,
1052400	1055920	and what the anthropologists have been noting for 60 years is
1055920	1060960	all human cultures traditionally have some very metamagical folks around,
1060960	1064160	and these folks are anything but peripheralized with a decreased
1064160	1068480	reproductive success, they're some of the most honored members of society.
1068480	1075120	So what you wind up getting here is that classic partially expressed sort of continuum deal going on
1075120	1079840	which is human societies throughout history have had such a need for shamans
1079840	1083520	that they can put up with the occasional second cousin who's fully schizophrenic,
1083520	1087280	as long as you've got the ratio right, and what the numbers suggest,
1087280	1091120	the 1 to 2 percent rate of schizophrenia throughout human cultures
1091120	1094480	and the number average population size of human villages
1094480	1099200	and the number of shamans it works about right. Throughout history there has been more of a
1099200	1104640	predominance of schizotypal shamans than of schizophrenics you can afford to put up with
1104640	1109680	the occasional cousin. Now where does this wind up heading? What the main point of this section is
1109680	1114960	about is this is not just about the people naked in the National Geographics with the bones on their
1114960	1120880	noses, and this was a critical transition recognizing this. At some point a whole lot of people in
1120880	1127280	that field were writing about the primitiveness of non-westernized religion, and there was a great
1127280	1132560	quote who came up with this one, a guy named Devereux referred to primitive religion as being
1132560	1140000	organized schizophrenia. This was somebody in the 1940s exactly getting this flavor of contextualized
1140000	1145360	appropriate hearing the voices at the right time, all of that, but this was overwhelmingly literature
1145360	1150080	about the weird stuff those folks are up to in the night and the time life specials on public
1150080	1156240	television and what the critical transition is is it's not just about them. At some point this
1156240	1161280	anthropologist Ackernick who was quite leftist in his orientation wrote a long essay saying how
1161280	1167040	incredibly culturally chauvinistic it was of the western anthropologists to write all these articles
1167040	1173760	about how shamans are half healed madmen and how condescending that was to talk about those cultures
1173760	1179920	as being so irrationally based in contrast to us and what's the obvious punchline is the problem
1179920	1184560	isn't saying that they're irrational when we're saying that we aren't but it's saying that we're
1184560	1189600	equally irrational. We are equally irrational in some of the tenets that we have here. A quote
1189600	1195600	from Ackernick at the time was our culture is unique and outlawing the irrational. Let me give
1195600	1202880	you some recent statistics from a survey. What's the name of the survey? The main national survey
1202880	1209920	of people. Who? Yes Gallipole that guy the Gallipole a recent Gallipole survey I don't know about you
1209920	1217200	guys but these numbers astonished me 25 percent of Americans say they believe in ghosts 36 percent
1217200	1224560	believe in mental telepathy 47 percent believe in UFOs and more than 50 percent of Americans believe
1224560	1231120	in the devil and a belief that the devil influences daily activities these are people who can vote
1231120	1236400	these are people who can serve on juries these are people who can operate motor vehicles these
1236400	1241760	are people making decisions about medical interventions I for one in this outpost of not
1241760	1247280	terribly extreme irrationality in this corner of the country I'm astonished we live in a world that
1247280	1253760	is highly irrational and the punchline of this is this is not simply about non-western traditional
1253760	1259920	human societies the exact same thread of schizotypillism runs throughout all of the belief systems
1259920	1266400	of human societies including western ones we are permeated by irrationality now some of the versions
1266400	1271760	of it that we have in the west are utter nonsense ones ones that have just been like invented out of
1271760	1277920	thin air in recent years which is kind of like fast food for these sort of Nuvo sort of medieval
1277920	1282960	peasants in their hot tubs up in Marin this is the world of crystals and channeling and things
1282960	1288000	of that sort but some of the versions of our westernized irrationally go back millennia
1288080	1294400	and organize some of our most cherished values the same irrationality and the same valuing
1294400	1300240	of those who invent the appropriate versions of the irrationality runs throughout the west
1300240	1305280	okay just to show you that I am not being overly hostile or will try to pull in my own sort of
1305280	1311040	tradition that I was raised in is not normally considered a sign of robust mental health to
1311040	1316960	hear voices coming out of burning bushes this is considered a worrisome sign this is considered
1316960	1322320	diagnostic it is not a good thing to be reporting that you just spent the night wrestling an angel
1322320	1327360	it is usually a very disturbing sign if you were reporting you've had a conversation with someone
1327360	1334560	who is dead and has risen from the grave these are diagnosable problems in our secular western realm
1334560	1341120	these are the backbones of our belief systems we in the west as well as we humans in non-westernized
1341120	1347040	settings schizotypillism runs through all of human history what you wind up having then
1347040	1352320	is this obvious question who invented this stuff who came up with the notion that the world was
1352320	1357600	invented in seven days or snakes with apples are up to something no good or it's possible to give
1357600	1362640	birth and you're still a virgin these were not designed by committees these were designed by
1362640	1368400	extremely formative extremely influential schizotypals throughout history yes
1371520	1377840	yep it's genetic evidence those same studies showed that it runs through the adoption studies
1377840	1382800	showed it's a biological trait it runs through the biological side of the adoptive pedigrees
1382800	1389680	it's a it's a genetic trait what the new studies are now being to show is mild tendency towards
1389680	1394960	increased dopamine tone mild tendency towards most of the biology we heard about what we're
1394960	1402000	seeing is totally artificial bucket to say schizophrenia up to here past the side non-schizophrenic
1402000	1406720	we have this in-between zone like everything else we've been thinking about it's on a continuum
1406720	1411520	and seems to be the same biology in a much milder form question somewhere there
1416080	1420240	yep same sort of stuff okay so what do you wind up yeah question
1425920	1426240	yep
1435520	1441760	no because the the critical thing there is they will very readily tell you much as people will
1441760	1447520	tell you here in their own schizotypal experiences that you need the right person to lead it they
1447520	1453360	can't get that going without the right shaman starting it off you need them as a catalyst yeah
1455840	1465920	okay why do we need this why do we value this okay we'll come to this probably in about two
1465920	1472800	days but this is tapping into all of the you know why why do we search for some fairly
1472800	1477680	unlikely answers to the big questions that plague all of us we'll come to this in two days but you
1477680	1482560	know this is getting at the core of some of the basic questions here okay let me push on here
1482560	1488160	what you wind up seeing with this is that this is on a continuum and who invented this stuff and
1488160	1494000	you look throughout the history of religious leaders those who have invented some of the theology
1494000	1498640	and we will come to different variants of religious leaders shortly as you see those who invented
1498640	1504880	the theology that there is very often a thread of metamagical thinking that goes through this
1504880	1510800	and this is metamagical thinking of a type that falls readily into the spectrum of schizotypalism
1510800	1516640	now one of the themes we've endlessly come back to in this class is appropriate context appropriate
1516640	1522480	context and this is a perfect realm to see this because what we wind up getting is you got to
1522480	1528080	get it just right if you hear voices it's got to be during the ceremony if you're speaking in tongues
1528080	1532320	it can't be in the middle of the silent part of the hunt you don't want to have too many of them
1532320	1537520	thank god we've got this shaman but not two of them around here you've got to get the context right
1537520	1543360	and what we've seen throughout human history and western history as well is get it wrong and we
1543360	1549120	have names for these things get it wrong and these are abortive religious fringe groups these are
1549120	1554160	cults and you look at some versions of this in our own recent time you look at david koresh and
1554160	1560480	waco you look at someone like james jinn jones and jones town you look at someone like charles
1560480	1566160	manson and these are people who were highly metamagical in their thinking highly charismatic
1566160	1571520	but hit a wall at the point where we still classify them as cults manson is a diagnosed
1571520	1576960	schizophrenic with the other two there's only post hoc sort of sort of forensic psychiatry
1576960	1582960	that you can do what you wind up getting is get it wrong and we call it a cult get it right in the
1582960	1587600	right time in the right place and maybe for the next couple of millennia people won't have to go
1587600	1594000	to work on your birthday if you get it exactly right in that setting so what i think we see here is
1594080	1600240	a setting here for making sense the exact same traits in a different context to use krober's
1600240	1606560	words in a cultural context that is not sanctioned the exact same traits count as psychiatrically
1606560	1612880	suspect these days what this is about is not only if you get it in the right context is it okay
1612880	1618720	it is highly honored tapping into the question that came in before that all human societies have a
1618800	1625280	strong need for a certain degree of these folks around you need to get the ratios right okay
1625280	1630160	picking up on this theme a transition to a next point in the sense that this is talking about
1630160	1635600	sort of the structural steel of religious belief what are the basic beliefs you have
1635600	1642480	there is no god but one he is a la the you know whatever versions of the central formats you have
1642480	1647920	there is a trinity i am who i am any of these variants these are sort of the building blocks the
1647920	1654160	structural steel of religion but what religion is often often also about is lots of other things
1654160	1660000	we have a very modern very westernized view of religion these days what religion is often about
1660000	1665840	is the social community that it brings you what religion is often about is the motivation for
1665840	1672240	good works throughout most of history what religion is about in one very orthodox variant is the
1672240	1678480	carrying out of rituals the daily performance of ritualistic behaviors in the context of religion
1678480	1684800	and this transitions us to the next subject in here and this whole notion of ritualism as a backbone
1684800	1690560	of religion wonderful quote to that effect henry ward beecher father of harry and beecher stowe
1690560	1696960	famous protestant preacher in new england i think the 1830s or so had this quote at the time religion
1696960	1702720	is daily bread religion is not just cake on sunday the notion that what religion is about
1702720	1709440	is the small acts god is in the detail religion is in the small acts of the daily rituals now
1709440	1715360	beginning to look not at the large theological notions our religion believes there are multiple
1715360	1720880	gods there are virgin births that god can speak through a burning bush but instead religion as
1720880	1726720	the daily practices of ritual now what is interesting about this what comes through with this is
1726720	1733440	another theme another subtype of a very mild version of a psychiatric disorder which once
1733440	1740320	again works spectacularly when you get it just right not now with the metamagical big theology
1740320	1746240	building blocks of religion but the daily bits and pieces of ritualism and this brings in another
1746240	1752240	psychiatric disorder one we haven't talked about much in class so far okay i guarantee on a regular
1752240	1758320	basis all of us in this room getting to some point where it's some anxious period you've got some
1758320	1762160	major deadline you're applying for some summer something rather that you really want to get
1762160	1766240	you're totally uptight about it you're sitting down and you're writing the essay and before you
1766240	1770400	can write the essay you got to get your favorite pen it's got to be right there and you got to
1770400	1774480	rearrange your desk and you got to get everything sorted out and finally you finish it and you go
1774480	1779200	mail off the application you know you put in the mailbox and you check again to make sure it went
1779200	1783440	down and this is really important you don't want to see it check again just to make sure and you're
1783440	1788080	all set for that and you finally there's no one else around so you go and you look in front of it
1788080	1791680	and looking back at that and that sort of thing i mean we all do this actually maybe we all do this
1791680	1797680	and i'm embarrassing myself horribly but my bet is most of us do this sort of thing we fall into
1797680	1804880	obsessive little rituals during times of anxiety we also have rituals intrusive thoughts that just
1804880	1810480	invade our heads at times where they are of no obvious purpose they are at the cost of thinking
1810480	1816000	anything more clearly it's totally maddening and you can't stop the thoughts for example today i'm
1816000	1822000	working on a paper that's involving all sorts of very deep ruminative thought and figuring out all
1822000	1826720	sorts of data stuff and i've made no progress on it at all this morning because for some reason
1826720	1831520	that i don't understand at all all of today i've had the damn theme song from teletubbies going
1832480	1837360	and i can't stop it especially the part where lala leaps up and says lala the really cute part
1837360	1843040	there and i can't stop doing this and i don't know what's going on i did not plan to lose today's
1843040	1848800	productivity because of teletubbies but we get this some stupid jingle that's stuck in your head
1848800	1854080	you find yourself going up a flight of stairs and you can't stop yourself from counting the steps
1854080	1860320	we do this we all do this and we tend to do it more often during periods of anxiety and the
1860320	1867200	interpretation of that is that we impose this totally arbitrary useless destructive structure
1867200	1873040	at a time when everything else feels like you're walking on quicksand we all do this as some sort
1873040	1879280	of adaptation to periods of anxiety and what we transition into now is talking about a psychiatric
1879280	1885680	disorder where people do this all the time and it not only gets in the way of them getting some work
1885680	1891840	done on a project that requires some concentration this is a disorder that absolutely destroys their
1891840	1899520	lives this is ocd obsessive compulsive disorder and the full blown version of it bears so little
1899520	1904880	resemblance to what any of us do when we are having to get the pen right and checking the mailbox
1904880	1910560	the third time and having the jingle go through your head for a while it is of such a scale larger
1910560	1916000	it is so much more destructive it is virtually unimaginable from our perspective people with
1916000	1923120	ocd have their lives completely destroyed by this disorder people with ocd in the full blown version
1923120	1929040	spent six hours a day washing their hands the characteristic that's always at the top of the
1929040	1936000	list with ocd is this obsessive focusing on hygiene is worried that you are constantly in some way
1936000	1942480	soiled six hours a day of washing these are people who cannot hold down jobs their marriages come
1942480	1948720	apart their relationships are destroyed because they cannot stop washing and you have in the reader
1948720	1955360	one profile of somebody with ocd from a book entitled the boy who couldn't stop washing this is the
1955360	1962000	symptom that always pops up at the top of the list and the actual washing process is ritualistic
1962000	1967680	beyond belief these are people who have bought seven different kinds of antibacterial soap
1967680	1972480	they go through this whole sequence the water has to be a certain temperature for the first level of
1972480	1978160	washing then a certain type of towel that they dry themselves off with that towel has to be put out
1978160	1983120	of the room because it's dirty then then the next layer of washing with the next soap go through two
1983120	1988880	hours of this they're finally done turn to leave to go to their job go to their whatever and on the
1988880	1994720	way out brush their elbow against the door and they have to start all over again and you will
1994720	2000080	stop them at that point and say you will miss this interview you will not get this job and they will
2000080	2006400	say yes i know but i'm not going to be able to function and i'm just it's dirty i know my elbow
2006400	2011440	i know i'm going to touch it then and then i'll get in my face and i just have to start over i'm
2011440	2015760	not going to be able to get anything done today anyway so i need to go wash if i don't wash i'm
2015760	2021600	not going to be able to and back they go and hours and hours of this people with ocd spend half
2021600	2028160	their waking hours doing this people with ocd just have constant sequences of numbers going in their
2028160	2035120	heads constant jingles intrusive thoughts they cannot stop thinking what if i don't stop the car
2035120	2040480	at the next stop sign what if i run down this person they have the intrusive thoughts of i'm
2040480	2045600	absolutely sure i struck somebody at that street crossing back there i've got to go back and check
2046240	2050400	okay they don't see anybody there they drive on five miles down the road
2051040	2056320	probably the person flew off into the bushes i have to go back and check i have to go back
2056320	2061360	and check they can never leave their home because they've left the door unlocked they go back they
2061360	2066400	check the door is locked they have to go back they left the gas on they left the light on this is
2066400	2072320	absolutely paralyzing intrusive thoughts what if i leaned over and struck the person next to me
2072320	2077760	what if somebody kills my loved ones you can't stop the thoughts they just keep coming at these
2077760	2083920	people they cannot enter or leave a place there is a paralysis about entering and leaving built
2083920	2089680	around this sort of almost magical exclusionary power that you get a transition into a place
2089680	2096080	they cannot enter a room until they do a prime number of tapings on the wall before entering
2096080	2100720	they can then not enter the room until if that's prime number and then a different prime number
2100720	2107920	with their left foot shaking completely arbitrary symptoms of having to enter and leave numerology
2107920	2113920	these people cannot begin a meal until the utensils are absolutely symmetrical and lined up and
2113920	2119200	they're never perfectly symmetrical and the entering and leaving ritual is never done right
2119200	2124000	and they certainly can't enter the classroom unless the number of steps from here to the door
2124000	2129920	is two times an interval that's with this a very mathematical quality to it and it's never quite
2129920	2134720	right and you've got to do it all over again and what's been pointed out one of the really
2134720	2141040	interesting sort of insights as to what ocd is about is that this is an anxiety disorder this
2141040	2147760	is a pathological attempt to impose structure to impose predictability to impose control
2147760	2154640	in a world where everything is pathologically provoking of a sense of dis ease and uncertainty
2154640	2161840	and anxiety and the absolute horrifying version of ocd that i've heard described is this metaphor
2161840	2167520	where this is straight out of ethology this is a fixed action pattern we all know the fixed action
2167520	2173280	pattern of a dog is settling down at night on its blanket and what does the dog do it circles a few
2173280	2178400	times before it settles down but then it circles a couple of more times and just as it's ready to
2178400	2182720	then it circles a few more and fine and you can see at some point the dog doesn't even want to do
2182720	2188800	this anymore and it takes a while longer in another 30 seconds before the dog can finally escape from
2188800	2197520	this fixed action pattern and sit down in ocd the person never ever escapes the person spends forever
2197520	2204000	circling on the blanket being unable to finally lie down and rest because they are just consumed
2204000	2210160	with these rituals with these obsessive intrusive thoughts and what you get is this is completely
2210160	2217040	paralyzing okay here's an example of an obsessive belief that we all have okay can anybody identify this
2222720	2228000	okay here's what it is this is an aerial view in fact it's a satellite photograph of here
2228000	2233760	this is a tray of rice crispy treats and you've just walked into the room and it looks like this
2233760	2238240	and for a huge percentage of us within a minute or so it's going to look like this
2238720	2244720	because we all feel this compulsive need to take a knife and cut off that edge okay let me just
2244720	2250720	canvas you on all of that okay how many of you okay how many of you do this for starters i certainly
2250720	2257280	do okay how many of you have those who do this cut off this bit here because it doesn't really count
2257280	2262720	on your diet okay a couple of hands how many of you cut it off because what's perfectly obvious is
2262720	2267520	going from this to this decreases the total perimeter so that it will stay fresher that way
2268720	2276320	okay problems that how many of you wind up doing it because it's just getting at you that
2276320	2281200	it's the knife's just there and you just have to cut it off and smooth out the edge yes that's why
2281200	2285760	we all do it and then what you then decide is that there's this little bump here which requires you
2285760	2291200	to trim this out and then there's a little bump and off you go with that and we all wind up doing
2291200	2297600	that but if this is what you did around the clock for your entire life it would destroy it and what
2297600	2303600	is most striking with people with ocd is you could never go through the sequence i just did
2303600	2309840	there's no insight the person does not sit there and say help there's something wrong with me i feel
2309840	2316160	this need to wash my hands six hours a day they say help there's something wrong with me i can never
2316160	2324400	get clean i'm just so dirty everything i do makes me dirty there's no insight into it okay so where
2324400	2330320	does this fit in again our modern version of religion our modern very secularly influenced
2330320	2337200	version of religion so often involves an emphasis on what religion is about is counseling the trouble
2337200	2341680	what religion is about is holding the hands of the newlyweds and making sure they understand
2341680	2346960	what they're getting into what religion is about is comforting the distance the bereaved what religion
2346960	2352480	is about is the good works but this is not what religion has often been about throughout history
2352480	2357680	often the religious leaders are not necessarily the ones who are most psychotherapeutically
2357680	2363040	minded or the most galvanizing of people into the good works often religious leaders have been
2363040	2368080	the ones at the head of a crusade often religious leaders have been the ones with the most vivid
2368080	2373440	images of what hell and damnation would be like but often what religious leaders have been are the
2373440	2380080	people who are best at doing the rituals and that has been another thread of religious practice
2380080	2386720	throughout history of religious leaders as often being among the most fervent the most accomplished
2386720	2391680	at carrying out of rituals now let me give you a sense of this because as i began to read more
2391680	2397040	on this this absolutely astonished me because i knew very little about this stuff just the scale
2397040	2402640	of this and starting off with what will probably be a fairly alien religion for most of you in here
2402640	2408800	and then moving into examples closer to home looking at orthodox very traditional hinduism
2408800	2415200	looking at the behaviors of a brahman an individual who devotes their entire life to ritualistic
2415200	2422640	practice in pursuit of their religion a brahman a highly observant brahman spends six hours a day
2422640	2429040	in cleansing rituals and there are detailed rules as to which hand you wash in what sequence
2429040	2434640	how many times you wash each hand separately how many each one together the sequence with which
2434640	2440320	you wash out one side of your mouth versus the other with water there are set rules for brahmans
2440320	2446160	as to how you were supposed to lie down at night dictating what your first sight is in the morning
2446160	2451360	there are set rules as to what direction you must face when defecating in terms of what you
2451360	2456720	were looking at at the time there are set rules for rituals you have to do when entering a temple
2456720	2462880	when leaving a temple there are set rules for how many breaths you take through each nostril
2462880	2468080	you close one nostril during your prayers for a certain number of breaths then you close the other
2468080	2473840	and all of these are very carefully stipulated the number of mouthfuls of food the number of
2473840	2480320	times you chew per mouthful the number of prayers you have to say per day sequences of magic numbers
2480320	2486880	all of this is absolutely spelled out and orthodox brahmans consume their entire days doing this
2487680	2492880	okay next example orthodox Judaism spectacularly yeah question
2496960	2503120	great okay hang on for a while we will come to that that's a superb question as to why they seem
2503120	2510960	to have lots to do with cleansing and food preparation wow thank you okay do you want to
2510960	2514800	why don't we take a five minute break right now and you can all store in the front here for handouts
2516880	2527040	lots of opinions here lots of thoughts once again that same thing i mentioned two days ago three days
2527040	2533200	ago whenever this is very provocative stuff take advantage of the course website put up some of
2533200	2539280	your opinions get dial-ons going on this because people lots of times have extremely strong opinions
2539280	2544320	on this and very interesting ones take advantage of this a couple of questions that just came up
2544320	2549520	how come people with ocd don't come down with learned helplessness why aren't they depressed
2549520	2557280	because part of the fuel behind ocd is you're always convinced aha one more now i know instead of
2557280	2564240	doing it 17 times 18 if i do it 18 then it's going to be perfect you've always just figured out
2564240	2569360	not only do i have to do the six hours of washing but make sure i never step on a crack and then i
2569360	2574560	won't break my mother's back you're always figuring out the next step then pointing out we're about to
2574560	2580320	go in a direction where what are the advantages of a mild version of ocd and we're discussing this
2580320	2585920	in a religious context i should point out in a secular context there's a tremendous advantage
2585920	2592720	to a mild version of ocd what it does is get you into a place like stanford what it does is work
2592720	2598720	to a tremendous advantage given how regimented and disciplined a lot of folks are in here get it in
2598720	2604480	the right context blah blah that theme that we have again and again okay shifting over just seeing
2604480	2611360	orthodox brahman belief and hinduism absolutely dominated virtually full time with ritualistic
2611360	2618960	behaviors orthodox jewelry a spectacular number of laws built around food preparation the kosher
2618960	2625360	laws very detailed rules as to how long of a time interval between eating one type of food and another
2625360	2631440	type of food if you inadvertently mix up the silverware with different types of food ritualistic
2631440	2636720	cleansing rituals that you have to go through involving putting the utensils in dirt for months
2636720	2643120	on end and special prayers that have to be said rules about how you enter and leave a holy place
2643120	2648480	involving certain prayers involving a certain ritualistic touching that you have to make on the
2648480	2655920	door jam there all sorts of magic numbers the number 18 has magical powers and orthodox Judaism
2655920	2662160	and it's built around numbers of times you have to say a prayer multiples of 18 you have these prayer
2662160	2667520	shawls that have strings on the end which have 18 knots in them and they have to be pulled a certain
2667520	2674720	number of times here's one of the amazing examples of ritualism okay these numbers have magical powers
2674720	2682080	and orthodox Judaism and you will note 365 is the number of days in the year 248 is the number of
2682080	2687040	bones that people believed were in the bodies during the middle ages when this evolved and together
2687040	2697280	613 according to the holy books there are 613 rules for daily behaviors 365 prohibitions every day
2697280	2702560	248 things that have to be done every day the preponderance of the prohibitions leading one
2702560	2707520	clearly fairly depressive rabbi back when to be saying obviously it would have been better if
2707520	2711440	none of us were born given the fact that there were more things that we could mess up by doing
2711440	2716800	but what you see here is which is highly ritualistic the number of prohibitions equaling the number of
2716800	2722400	days of the year the number of ritual constraints equaling the number of bones in the body 613
2722400	2727840	is the magic number okay where did these numbers come from very often in religious rituals what
2727840	2734480	you find is a number has symbolic value because it's got a certain appeal for making learning
2734480	2741680	easier it is not by chance that a base 10 society came up with 10 commandments because 10 commandments
2741680	2747600	that are much easier to remember than 9 or 11 what are these about you would say okay well there's
2747600	2753120	some sort of ritualistic content here god the number of things god doesn't want us to do each day
2753120	2757120	is equal to the number of days of the year the number thing god wants us to do is equal to the
2757120	2762880	number of bones in the body okay great device for remembering the rules but here's the amazing
2762880	2768880	thing nobody knows the rules you look through thousands of pages of commentary stretching back
2768880	2775040	centuries and the rules aren't written down and various rabbis have made a living arguing over
2775040	2781360	what are the 365 things you aren't supposed to do each day in other words the numbers are more
2781360	2788080	important than the content the content is less critical than the fact that whatever they are
2788080	2793760	there's 365 things that god doesn't want you to do and whatever they are there's 248 that god
2793760	2799440	wants you to do the number that you are attributing to god is more important in that case than the
2799440	2808160	content okay classic classic obsessive numerology switching over traditional orthodox islam what
2808160	2814320	you find there is very detailed rules as to what foods you can eat what the first food is you're
2814320	2820320	supposed to eat each day there are rules as to how you enter and leave a holy place there are rules
2820320	2827120	for very ornate cleansing after release relieving yourself very very detailed rules when you are
2827120	2833360	washing out your mouth how many mouthfuls of water which hands you wash in which sequence the exact
2833360	2839920	same thing exact same rules as with an ocd person after the showering explicitly written down when
2839920	2845120	a man is washing himself at the ends of the at the end of the cleansing should he happen to touch
2845120	2851680	his penis he has to do the whole sequence all over again magic numbers thought to have powers there
2851680	2858800	seven ten seventy and a hundred apparently have magical powers in islam and you have very explicit
2858800	2865920	concrete instructions about them Muhammad himself wrote down that a man who says a prayer with clean
2865920	2872720	teeth gets seventy times the brownie points as a man saying his prayers without them multiples of
2872720	2878480	magic numbers with all of that and probably for most of you by now what will be the most familiar
2878480	2884720	is looking at orthodox christianity and you have rosaries in the counting of rosaries you have three
2884800	2890000	is a magic number you have very detailed numbers of times you are supposed to say prayers you have
2890000	2895040	rules for entering and leaving churches even in christian groups that are viewed as some of the
2895040	2900560	least ritualistic some of the most cerebral in some ways you look at the Lutherans Lutherans
2900560	2906720	have set rules for prayers that are only said during even years prayers that are only said during odd
2906720	2913440	years all of these versions of orthodoxy are absolutely shocked through with rituals built
2913440	2919200	around cleansing of the body food preparation entering and leaving of significant places
2919200	2925840	and numerology it's the exact same list as you find with ocd and Freud a hundred years ago
2925840	2932080	came up with this amazing quote to that regard Freud described obsessive compulsive disorder ocd
2932080	2941440	quote as an individual religiosity and religion as a universal obsessional compulsion he absolutely
2941440	2945840	linked the two now just when you're thinking that i'm standing here and i'm started going to start
2945840	2951680	pathologizing religious belief from sort of a medical psychiatric standpoint the exact same
2951680	2957280	conclusion has been reached by religious leaders over the centuries as well in the 15th century
2957920	2964800	there was st. Loyola no st. Ignatius of Loyola and what this guy did was he wrote this long track
2964800	2971040	describing scrupulosity scrupulosity is not a common word in english anymore but it's opposite
2971040	2977520	certainly is being unscrupulous being scrupulous having scrupial scrupulosity at the time was
2977520	2984240	defined as someone who was going through religious ritual for its own sake someone who was not thinking
2984240	2989760	about the content but was just doing the ritual and he wrote this long track to catholic priest
2989760	2995520	saying watch out for people like these people who were coming and being super devout but you will
2995520	3000560	notice they're just doing the rituals without thinking of the content your job is to recognize
3000560	3006160	them and guide them back into actually focusing on the content they shouldn't be doing the rituals
3006160	3011760	for their own sake there's a danger of people like that showing up in the Talmud an orthodox
3011760	3017600	Judaism the exact same thing there is a law in there that when you read the holy book of Judaism
3017600	3023200	the Torah you were not allowed to do it by heart you have to actually read the words because there
3023200	3029200	is an injunction to think about the content don't do it in a rote way and Muhammad himself
3029200	3034800	in Islam wrote down that people who give prayers without thinking about the content the prayers
3034800	3041040	don't count even religious leaders for centuries for millennia have recognized the pull of religious
3041040	3047440	ritual for its own sake to have to admonish religious adherents to pay attention to the content
3047440	3053040	because the ritual takes on a life of its own where the numbers the content the ritual is more
3053040	3070000	important than the actual thought behind it yeah
3073280	3079040	exactly and that was that point that transition talking about schizotypillism there's much more
3079120	3086000	resemblance to the large theological building blocks of religion of spirituality what are our
3086000	3091520	military's principles what do we believe do we believe you always follow orders you never follow
3091520	3097200	orders you don't agree with what's more important value sort of stuff this is instead in the realm of
3097200	3101920	religious practice and this is the realm of very orthodox religious practice absolutely
3101920	3107600	completely different realm so where am i heading with this obviously emphasizing the similarity
3107600	3113680	of the traits and that whole business that once again have a six hour compulsion to wash your
3113680	3120720	hands each day and have it occur in the secular context of ocd it destroys your life you cannot
3120720	3126960	function in society you are peripheralized you are mentally ill and that exact same theme get it
3126960	3133200	right in the right context and this is protected this is honored this is rewarded get it in the
3133200	3140160	right setting now nothing about being able to do rituals and turn them from your own private ocd
3140160	3146720	into the religious setting this is not a process for making the anxiety go away it's very important
3146720	3151360	when people are pulling off these rituals in a religious setting it's not to make the anxiety
3151360	3157920	go away it's to share it it's to share it over time and space with a larger community it's to
3157920	3164800	take this nameless dread and to give it a name and to have that name come with feeding instructions
3164800	3170320	and all sorts of rules for how to please the source of the named dread at this point it's not to
3170320	3177440	make the anxiety go away it's to make the anxiety shared now from this transitioning from this notion
3177440	3183280	that okay in the right setting the same exact trait that can ruin your life can in fact be
3183280	3189840	enveloped rewarded welcomed protected in the context of religious belief now taking it one step
3189840	3217520	further yeah question sure no it definitely doesn't but from that standpoint this is
3217520	3222000	speaking to one aspect of what it's doing and we still haven't come to the question that was up
3222000	3227200	there before isn't there an ecological reason why there should be these rituals about cleansing
3227200	3231760	and food preparation we'll come to that shortly but the other point you brought up maybe this is
3231760	3237200	to foster a sense of community but this comes back to the question around there before why should
3237200	3243680	people in a communal sense feel better why should we all feel better when we do rituals and our
3243680	3247920	rituals of counting the stairs and making sure the application really went down the mailbox
3247920	3253280	why do we feel even better when we do it in the context of the community you're absolutely right
3253280	3259760	that these are meant to foster the group shared features of religiosity and spirituality the
3259760	3264960	question then becomes why does it work why do we respond to it why do we need shamans and
3264960	3271200	why do we respond to this ability to share these customs why is it the trait of 18 year olds all
3271200	3276480	over the world to try to invent a whole bunch of generationally shared rituals that lets the world
3276480	3281200	know i have nothing whatsoever to do with those appalling people who embarrass me my parents
3281200	3287680	what's that whole separation that goes in why is it that individuation is very often going hand in
3287680	3293440	hand with i need a community to do this individuation with that in a sense is the question and that
3293440	3299360	kind of brings us to this next issue looking at sort of a next scale of this application of this
3299360	3305760	ritualism by far one of the weirdest stories that france kafka ever wrote was the hunger artist
3305760	3312800	and this is a story about a person who performs starving his performance is he comes into a town
3312800	3318240	and he's locked up in a cage in the middle of town and he entertains he performs people performs there
3318240	3323760	by starving himself and people come and watch him starve and initially you read this and this
3323760	3328960	sounds like one of the more bizarre parables that kafka has come up with until you read that during
3328960	3334720	the middle ages there were hunger artists there were people who performed in european cities
3334720	3341280	starving themselves in a ritualistic way for people to come and watch suddenly we now look at a next
3341280	3348240	level the notion of performing rituals and people who are very good at it once again what are religious
3348240	3354480	leaders about mostly these days we think of them in terms of people who are empathic people who are
3354480	3360000	able to use the religious tradition they come from to make people treat each other better to
3360000	3364640	comfort people during troubled times but back to that issue that some of the time what a religious
3364640	3370160	leader is about is someone who is excellent at doing rituals and when you look at the history
3370160	3376640	of religion not only do you have the capacity for somebody to suddenly lose themselves to finally
3376640	3382480	have the same life destroying rituals being sanctioned and protected you have people who
3382480	3388800	could make a living performing the rituals you can have people who are aptly rewarded for doing so
3388800	3394800	some examples starting off with traditional hinduism there is a mantra there called the
3394800	3400080	gayatri mantra which i'm sure i'm mispronouncing but in traditional brahmanism you are supposed
3400080	3405920	to say this mantra two million four hundred thousand times in a lifetime to guarantee a good
3405920	3411280	afterlife and what happens is you have these aging captains of industry who were worried that may
3411280	3415440	not have quite gotten the right number in there and are feeling the years catching up with them
3415440	3421200	and what do you do you hire yourself a bunch of brahmins to come and say the prayer two million
3421200	3426160	four hundred thousand times for you and you say it in appropriate multiples there are set rules
3426160	3433680	you hire two hundred forty of them so each of them says ten thousand hundred thousand a thousand
3433680	3438000	ten thousand each of them says a whole lot of them and they all say the same number and there
3438080	3442560	are rules for what sort of tent city you put up for them in your backyard and what sort of feast
3442560	3449040	you throw for them you hire people to come and do the rituals for you that get you your afterlife
3449040	3455920	switching over to judaism these rules of orthodox food preparation there is an entire job you can get
3455920	3461920	built around ritualistic preparation of food now there is a certain primary level of this
3461920	3467120	which is people who make a living making sure food is prepared in a kosher way that they slaughter
3467120	3472160	animals things of that sort but there's a whole second level people who make a living watching
3472160	3477600	the folks who prepare the food you have rabbis who make a living sitting around and slaughter
3477600	3482640	houses and making sure the animals are slaughtered in a ritualistically appropriate way these guys
3482640	3487840	don't do anything with their own hands their entire job is to watch and make sure the rituals
3487840	3493520	are done right so that you can produce like fat free tofu hot dogs that would bring a smile to the
3493520	3498880	lips of the patriarchs it's done so ritualistically correctly these guys make a living doing this
3498880	3503680	and then the version probably we are most familiar with the american experience you have the high
3503680	3509840	school graduation you have the opening of the new town whatever and what happens the local clergyman
3509840	3516960	comes out and does a convocation says a prayer is invited to come and do a ritual to mark this
3516960	3522160	community transition and our response here is well yeah of course that's the guy's job and that's
3522160	3528320	exactly the point you could make a living doing these rituals and you can do that job these days
3528320	3534640	complete with health insurance and a retirement package and a 401k and all of that you make a
3534640	3540400	living doing rituals and when you look at the history of religion suddenly what you see is an
3540400	3545280	inevitable outcome of that if there's somebody who's spending all his time washing his hands
3545280	3549840	ritualistically for the good of the community there's some peasant out there who's got to work
3549840	3555280	by the sweat of his brow to make bread for two people instead of one and there's an amazing novel
3555280	3559840	a science fiction novel and absolutely caught this which struck me as like one of the truly
3559840	3565600	horrible novels in terms of writing style almost as bad as asimov but in there was this brilliant
3565600	3571760	idea a book called zenicide by a writer named orson scott card and had this brilliant idea that
3571760	3578000	absolutely caught this and this was on as always a multi-planetary empire and the people running
3578000	3583840	the evil empire figured out the people on some planet were biologically very very prone towards
3583840	3589120	being extremely smart we could dissect that in lots of ways perhaps the particular prenatal
3589120	3593920	environment on that planet but they nonetheless worried that this planet had great danger for
3593920	3598800	producing revolutionaries that were going to leave the overthrow of the empire so what they did
3598800	3605840	was invent a virus a virus which caused obsessive compulsive disorder and they infected a subset
3605840	3610800	of people on this planet with the virus and the virus integrated into the dna so it would be passed
3610800	3617040	on multi-generationally and suddenly you had a subset of people who were paralyzed with ocd with
3617040	3622560	counting rituals and all of that and what did they manage to foist off on the rest of the population
3622560	3628160	these were religious experiences they were having and within a few generations this had become a
3628160	3633280	priestly class who sat around all day carrying out their obsessive rituals and the rest of the
3633280	3638240	population couldn't begin to think of revolting against the empire because they were spending all
3638240	3643120	day long having to come up with enough food to feed the priestly class and what you suddenly had
3643120	3650000	was a paralysis built around an entire class that does nothing other than carry out these rituals
3650000	3655600	and that planet was no worry to the rest of the empire at that point what you wind up seeing is
3655600	3662640	that truly involved ritualistic religious belief is often at the cost of doing anything else
3662640	3669360	there's a spectacular example of this historically and this is a 16th century augustinian monk in
3669360	3674640	germany named luder and this guy happened to have left a lot of written records and this guy is a
3674640	3681760	classic example of this he was the son the only son of a very aggressive very violent father there
3681760	3686880	was some suggestion that the father had in fact killed somebody once and abroad the son was absolutely
3686880	3693840	terrified of him and was extremely obedient to him very anxious very psychosomatic young man
3693840	3699360	one day he is out for a walk it's caught in a lightning storm out in an open field has a panic
3699360	3704800	attack there because the lightning storm makes a devotional agreement at that point if he can
3704800	3710480	survive this lightning storm he will become a monk he promises god that he survives he becomes a
3710480	3716640	monk and he is absolutely paralyzed with his ritualistic training he leaves records about
3716640	3722560	when he had his first mass he fainted beforehand he was so nervous about doing it wrong the mass
3722560	3727360	went on three times the length that was supposed to because he kept having to stop and start over
3727360	3732560	again because he was sure he had done something wrong he spent approximately five hours a day
3732560	3738960	in confession with his priestly mentor there his sort of advisor there confessing to every this is
3739040	3743120	a guy who lived in a monastery he didn't have a chance to do anything sinful but he'd be in there
3743120	3748480	five hours a day when i said this prayer i wasn't mindful enough about it i did it by rote when i
3748480	3753200	did this i wasn't thinking enough about this i pretty sure i didn't wash my hands enough
3753200	3758240	before doing this prayer i did this wrong god is angry at me for doing this i'm sure god is angry
3758240	3764640	at me for doing this and records his mentor this elderly priest eventually in exasperation
3764640	3770400	said one of the most astonishingly modern psychoanalytically insightful things imaginable
3770400	3777840	he said enough already god isn't angry with you for some reason you are very angry with god
3777840	3783360	god doesn't care about how many times you're washing your hands and the most definitive thing
3783360	3788880	about this young man this young priest was something he left in his records he washed
3788880	3794640	hours and hours a day an exact quote from him the more i wash the dirtier i get
3795760	3802320	and this is ocd and why do we know so much about this man because we know him 500 years later
3802320	3807840	not by his latin name of luder we know him by his more westernized name of martin luther
3807840	3813840	this was martin luther the founder of protestantism and these were the transitional events in his life
3813840	3819600	and talk about somebody who takes his personal affliction and turns it into perhaps the most
3819600	3825440	influential event of the last thousand years in western european history this is someone who turned
3825440	3831600	it into the biggest display of failing to obey his father that anybody has seen in the history of
3831600	3838800	catholicism and this was a person paralyzed by obsessive compulsive disorder so what we get here
3838800	3845280	at this point is the obvious question who invented knocking on wood for good luck who's the hindu who
3845280	3850800	had some sort of obsession with the number 24 or the jew with an obsession with the number 18
3850800	3856160	who got this belief that god was completely obsessed with the numbers of bones in the body and that's
3856160	3862240	how many things you should do well we have here is not only the recognition that if you are ocd
3862240	3868720	religion can provide a sanctuary if you are ocd in the right setting you can in fact make a living
3868720	3875360	by being religiously ritualistic but the recognition that probably people with strong obsessive compulsive
3875360	3881760	tendencies had something to do with the invention of many of these rituals i suspect historically
3881760	3886960	that's where it has come from so that brings up the issue that was brought up before why should
3886960	3893440	these rituals be so similar you look at the prohibitions for example in judaism more than 200
3893440	3898640	of these have to do with food preparation and cleansing you see the sequence in any of these
3898640	3906000	and the top four in ocd are identical to the top four in all of these religions cleansing of the body
3906000	3913840	food preparation entering and leaving significant religious places and numerology numbers why should
3913840	3920480	that be basically two types of explanations one is we may be seeing some sort of convergence
3920480	3925280	it's not by chance that people are highly ritualistically concerned with making sure their
3925280	3930560	bodies are clean and that their food is correctly prepared and i suspect that has part to do with
3930560	3935760	it but i suspect what we're also seeing and with records of people like martin luther what we're
3935760	3941280	also seeing is because some of the people who invented some of these religious rituals had a
3941280	3948000	background of ocd maybe not fully paralytic versions but nonetheless somebody spending five
3948000	3952800	hours a day washing his hands and five hours a day confessing about how he didn't wash his hands
3952800	3960160	enough this does not seem to be a mild version the more i wash the dirtier i get okay what i think
3960160	3967440	you wind up seeing is that historically all sorts of folks generating rituals ocd is estimated to
3967440	3972720	have an incidence anywhere from one to ten percent in the population depending on how you define it
3972720	3980080	the continuum and what you have is i suspect in periods of religious crisis cultural crisis
3980080	3986000	during a period of persecution during the period where whatever is currently in shape is not working
3986000	3991040	the right person at the right moment comes forward and in effect says this is how i have
3991040	3996880	been privately honoring our lord all these years and i am offering it to all of you to see
3996880	4002000	this is what i have been doing and in the right place and time it catches on and it turns into
4002000	4008240	the thing that is the ritual for the rest of the community within decades okay so what i've been
4008240	4014000	suggesting here and what i also emphasize is none of this is original with me except for the notion
4014000	4019520	that the ocd has something to do with the invention of these rituals these ideas go back decades go
4019520	4025280	back centuries that there is a parallelism between the symptoms of what we call schizotypillism
4025280	4031360	and the metamagical backbone of religious theology there is a parallelism between what we call
4031360	4038160	obsessive compulsive disorder and the ritualism of mainstream orthodox religion and this key point
4038160	4045280	that the exact same behaviors which in one context destroys your life has you peripheralized do it
4045280	4050320	right do it in the right context and it is not peripheralizing it makes you very honored and
4050320	4064640	powerful there are more themes yeah wonderful question would you expect to see different
4064640	4071520	incidences of ocd type traits in different cultures depending on how secular the society is how
4071520	4077280	ritualistic the religion is you look at for example catholicism or high episcopalianism
4077280	4082640	highly ritualistic compared to lutherans or unitarians or quakers at the other end would
4082640	4087760	you expect to see different different incidences absolutely i don't know if anybody's studying
4087760	4092960	that that would be exactly a prediction you would expect okay a related one which taps
4092960	4098160	into the lecture on friday would you expect to see differences in the incidence of depression
4098160	4104400	depending on religiosity and boring do you see that with a vengeance one of the healthiest things
4104400	4110320	you could do with your life is to be religious and to be highly religious it is a very strong
4110320	4116400	protector against major depression religious belief extends your life expectancy and that's
4116400	4122240	after you control for it changes risk factors you're less likely to drink to excess all of that
4122240	4128480	what is the big issue in that field is do the health benefits of religiosity merely come from
4128480	4133040	the social community that you get typically by being religious the question early in the
4133040	4140080	lecture today religiosity versus spirituality that might be a realm to dissociate them spirituality
4140080	4145040	if it's a very personal one you wouldn't get the community do you still get the health benefits
4145040	4150400	nobody knows at this point but those are studies that people are doing but absolutely one of the
4150400	4155680	greatest things you can do out there to buffer yourself from depression is to be religiously
4155680	4161360	believing and walk through all the steps at the end of the lecture the other day elements of control
4161440	4167920	predictability explanation outlet and you will see exactly how religion taps into that okay couple
4167920	4174880	more threads here in terms of making sense of some of the covariance between biological phenomenon
4174880	4179600	behavior that we can explain and patterns of religious belief back to something we talked
4179600	4186160	about earlier in the course take a hungry pigeon and put it in a cage and instead of the behaviorist
4186160	4192480	circumstance where it has to press a lever umpteen times to get food you randomly reward it and what
4192480	4199280	we discussed there was a pigeon has a strong psychic need to come up with an attribution
4199280	4205840	what did i do to cause this food to appear and what we went through was the fact that if a pigeon
4205840	4211440	is hungry enough and the reward is both big enough and random enough the pigeon has a prepared learning
4211440	4218640	state to make it think ah whatever i just did is what caused that to occur and then you suddenly
4218640	4224240	have superstitious conditioning the capacity to get pigeons doing the most outlandishly
4224240	4229600	ritualistic things over and over and over in the belief that that's the cause of the food appearing
4229600	4235360	and what we heard was take a room full of hungry pigeons and randomly reward all of them with food
4235360	4240000	at different points and come back a few days later and every pigeon is going to be having its own
4240080	4246960	private belief system built around in order to get food i have to do x the enforcement of superstitious
4246960	4252560	belief and that is the term that is used in psychology and as we often have here is a question
4252560	4258400	of is this word a metaphor is this word an inappropriate metaphor or what is superstitious
4258400	4264720	belief and to go back to the question that came up here before why do we have a societal need for
4264720	4269760	shamans why do we have a societal need for much of this because we are trying to explain the
4269760	4275520	unexplainable we are trying to look for causal links of things that may or may not be associated
4275520	4282320	this is basically a way of describing superstition how tight of a link do you need between cause and
4282320	4287760	effect to believe that there has been cause and effect and this is coming down to statistical
4287760	4293520	relations and if you allow yourself to believe that this prayer could be answered but it wasn't
4293520	4298640	this time because i wasn't concentrating enough i need to do it a bit more fervently all of that
4298640	4305440	you have a system that allows us very readily to see causal links that may not be there now what is
4305440	4311440	the next interesting neurobiological piece of this is that take animals take rats and damage their
4311440	4318640	hippocampus and what you get with hippocampal damage then is you have more trouble making causal
4318720	4324160	sequential links and events what you wind up seeing and this next sentence is meant to be
4324160	4330640	as provocative as it will sound is when you have rats with hippocampal damage they are more vulnerable
4330640	4338960	to superstitious conditioning essentially what that is saying is that as you have a damaged
4338960	4345280	hippocampus you have less of a capacity to tell the difference between accurate cause and effect
4345280	4351760	linkages and ones that are merely statistically hinting of that or ones that may not be in the
4351760	4357360	slightest that connected with each other hippocampal damage and rats have a lower threshold for
4357360	4362560	superstitious conditioning and we can very readily run with that one in terms of what the
4362560	4368480	implications of that might be going on our usual sequence from in order to appreciate a biological
4368480	4374800	effect big gross lesion sort of stuff to once again the much more subtle realm we all differ
4374800	4380560	in our number of hippocampal neurons in the amount of this enzyme in the amount of myelin and all
4380560	4387280	the biology we know all the individual differences a last disorder that winds up being interesting
4387280	4393680	there is a type of epilepsy which when you have it something happens to your religious belief system
4393680	4398480	and this is one of its characteristic features epileptic seizures as I think we've discussed
4398480	4403600	in here have characteristics as to what part of the brain they originate in and this is
4403600	4408960	epilepsy that originates in the temporal lobe the temporal lobe containing the hippocampus the
4408960	4416000	amygdala it's a big limbic area the temporal lobe temporal lobe epilepsy and about 30 years ago
4416000	4420640	a neurologist named Geshwin who was at Harvard he was probably the most influential neurologist of
4420640	4426480	the 20th century and Geshwin published a paper first describing what is now called temporal
4426480	4433120	lobe personality which is a cluster of personality traits that become far more common in people
4433120	4438800	with temporal lobe epilepsy once again not everybody with this personality profile has
4438800	4444320	epilepsy lurking there not everybody with temporal lobe epilepsy gets this profile but
4444320	4449200	statistically at a higher than expected rate what do you see with temporal lobe personality
4449200	4456640	first off the person becomes extremely serious and humorless okay you might say I would become
4456640	4461600	extremely serious and humorless if I suddenly came down with epilepsy what's the appropriate control
4461600	4468160	looking at other types of epilepsies of equivalent severity it's specific to temporal lobe so you
4468160	4474480	get the seriousness next thing you get is what is termed neophobia you don't like new things you
4474480	4480080	like to just do very familiar sorts of stuff the same small circle of friends the same very
4480800	4486160	relatively limited range of experiences okay if I had epilepsy I would suddenly get a lot more
4486160	4492080	sort of involuted in my lifestyle once again the controls or other types of epilepsies next thing
4492080	4499360	you see is this bizarre trait called hypergraphia which is people with temporal lobe personality
4499360	4508320	begin to write obsessively they feel a pressured need to write fourth trait and the most interesting
4508320	4513840	one of all is people with temporal lobe personality become obsessively interested
4513840	4520720	in religious and philosophical subjects and these are not people with uncontrolled seizures
4520720	4525600	happening all the time these are people whose seizures are relatively well controlled with
4525600	4530400	medication and once again well if I had this horrible neurological disease I'd suddenly
4530400	4535280	start getting more introspective but once again control for with the other types of epilepsy
4535280	4540800	and the classic temporal lobe patient that you see is somebody who is meeting a new neurologist
4540800	4545280	and says oh hi great to meet you you know I very strongly believe that a patient should be more
4545280	4550800	than just their symptoms so I've prepared this 60 page document here which is my philosophy about
4550800	4555600	life and meaning and at the next week's appointment comes back with a 40 page addendum this is what
4555600	4561440	you wind up seeing and there's this fabulous story told showing that it's not that you get religious
4561440	4566800	you get interested in religious and philosophical subjects this great story showing this and this
4566800	4572640	was apparently shortly after Geshwin first published this paper and he had some neurology
4572640	4577600	resident who one day all the residents were in there and the neurology resident was summarizing
4577600	4582480	some patient this was some 13 year old boy in there with temporal lobe epilepsy and he went through
4582480	4587200	the meds and all of that and how the kid was doing and at the end said oh by the way I just read your
4587200	4592160	paper on that personality stuff this kid doesn't fit at all doesn't fit in the slightest clearly doing
4592160	4596800	some chest thumping kind of territorial stuff with the big man there and Geshwin says oh yeah
4596800	4601760	really how come and he said because I asked him if he's religious he said no he's not Geshwin says
4601760	4606240	idiot out of my way he pushes him and goes stormy down the hall and the residents running after him
4606240	4610560	bursts into this kid's room and says oh hi I'm Dr. Geshwin and puts him through a neurological
4610560	4614320	exam and all of that and goes through and asked him does he like baseball has the weather all of
4614320	4618720	that and then offhandedly says well by the way are you religious and the boy says no I'm not and
4618720	4624560	then Geshwin asks the critical question he says oh how come and this 13 year old kid gives this
4624560	4629680	hour-long lecture about the internal inconsistencies of Christ's Sermon on the mountain the epic of
4629680	4635200	Gilgamesh and sort of Ancadi's treatment of this and Bertrand Russell's critique of Christ
4635200	4640000	and like Geshwin just leaves the residents in their torture to listen to this kid for an hour
4640000	4645280	and it's not becoming religious it's becoming fascinated with the subject and there's even
4645280	4651200	been a paper published in a neurology journal doing the sort of paleo forensic neurology
4651200	4657440	by neurologist speculating someone who in history had temporal lobe epilepsy and this was Saint Paul
4657440	4663200	Saint Paul who had seizure auras as documented no evidence that the guy was particularly humorous
4663200	4668960	the guy was hyper graphic as hell and clearly had a very strong interest in religious and
4668960	4674560	philosophical subjects and you know this is fun but what do you make of the fact that somebody
4674640	4680400	has an uncontrolled seizure in this part of the brain for 30 seconds once every six months
4680400	4685200	and they become more interested in religious subjects and at the end of the handout I cite
4685200	4691040	a novel that was published a couple years ago called lying awake fabulous novel by Mark Salisman
4691040	4698080	talking about a nun who is in the middle of a rather dispiriting life experience as a nun it
4698080	4703840	has not been what she was hoping for it has mostly been empty ritual and in the last few years
4703840	4709360	she's been having religious visions and this is the most exciting thing that has ever happened to her
4709360	4714720	what she also has to admit is she has kind of become a star of her convent after being this
4714720	4720720	very peripheral nobody and they're publishing books about her visions and people are coming to see her
4720720	4725760	and what becomes apparent halfway through the book is that she has a tumor in her temporal lobe which
4725760	4731600	is causing temporal lobe seizures and suddenly what does it mean that this is what these visions
4731600	4736800	have been about what does it mean that this is something that somebody in a white coat would call
4736800	4742880	a disease is this a disease and do I want my disease cured do I want this taken away from me
4742880	4749040	and it's extraordinary novel absolutely getting these features of temporal lobe personality and
4749040	4754240	getting at this issue which now is the core of what this whole lecture has been what do we do with
4754240	4760240	something like this what do we do with the possibility that have an uncontrolled burst of
4760240	4766320	action potentials in one part of your brain for 30 seconds every six months and in a somewhat
4766320	4772640	deterministic way that makes you more interested in religious subjects now summarizing here what I
4772640	4777760	think is really important for me to emphasize is what I'm not saying because that I've kind of
4777760	4782240	learned the hard way over the years I'm touching on the subject in this class what things I am not
4782240	4789680	saying I am not saying ooh some snotty you got to be crazy to be religious that's nonsense nor am I
4789680	4796400	saying even that most people who are are psychiatrically suspect I'm not saying that in the slightest
4796400	4804080	what I'm saying is it is absolutely fascinating that the same exact traits which in a secular context
4804080	4811520	are life destroying separate you from the community and in the right setting are at the very core of
4811520	4818080	what is protected what is sanctioned what is rewarded what is valued in religious settings so often
4818080	4823600	and that there could be an underlying biology to this and what do we do with this what's most
4823600	4829040	interesting here is even if this describes one single person I mean to put cards on the table
4829040	4834400	I was raised in an extremely religious orthodox upbringing and I had a complete break with it
4834400	4840400	when I was about 14 and that process of completely breaking to the point now where I have no religion
4840400	4846320	I have no spirituality I'm utterly atheist and in passing it is probably the thing I most regret in
4846320	4851600	my life but it's something I appear not to be able to change the process of getting to that point
4851600	4857520	I view in retrospect as one of the most defining things in my life the process of turning into
4857520	4864160	that person from who I was what are we to make of the possibility that each one of us goes through
4864160	4869760	some equivalent version in our life deciding how religious or irreligious we are going to be
4869760	4875120	for a lot of us that are among the most defining features of who we are where we have wound up
4875120	4880560	with this and how we got there what do we make of the fact that even if there's one case in all
4880560	4887120	of human history of someone who got to wherever they were instead because of a neurotransmitter
4887120	4893120	hiccup because of a genetic influence because of something that we would see as deterministic as
4893120	4898800	your visions are due to a tumor in your temporal lobe what are we to do with this what I am also
4898800	4904960	saying here is it is just as interesting to ask this question about why some of us lose faith
