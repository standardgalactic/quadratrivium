1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
This will be a lecture looking at a whole lot of the themes we've been

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,400
considering all quarter in here, how they apply to a topic that is very close to

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,040
home. And what I already know from some of the emails today was Friday's

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,740
lecture, looking at depression, was already getting close to home. Some of the

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,920
themes that came out at the end of the chaos lecture, some of the notions

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,720
there that some of the stuff teaching us, perhaps there are no blueprints,

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,640
perhaps there need not be blueprints, perhaps there may still be blueprints

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,360
despite a theoretical demonstration that you don't need them hitting close to

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,520
home also, that is what all of today's lecture is about, looking at some

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,480
biological underpinnings of religiosity. And this one is far and away from the

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,560
lecture I am most nervous for, simply because this one people wind up having

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,040
strong opinions about, and I want to navigate through this one as successfully

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,200
as possible. Okay, just to give me a sense of where I'm starting off from here,

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,880
how many of you would characterize yourself as religious, as fairly

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:08,560
religious, as highly religious? Okay, good. How many of you would characterize

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,960
yourself as very, very comfortably, exceptingly non-religious? Lots of

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,200
hands there as well. Okay, lots of potential differences in responding to

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,360
this. Where we pick up on is from where we left off with a lecture last

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,360
Wednesday, which was the schizophrenia lecture. And where we finished with was

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,680
this whole notion that by now we have to have dealt with every single one of

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,120
these topics, starting on the far right, what's the behavior look like, and

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,400
eventually getting to the far left, what are the evolutionary roots? And what has

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,160
always been the rationale for that is the second we're looking at anything with

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,440
genes, genetic influences, genetic hints, genetic whatever, we're asking where

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,360
these genes come from, where's the evolutionary sense, where's the adaptive

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,280
value for anything we're looking at? How would a sociobiologist interpret it

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,480
to someone else? Yeah, question?

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,600
I should be, and I don't think I understand the subject enough to know. Other

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,480
than something about religiosity is done in a social context, and that's going

30
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,520
to become important here. And the difference is one that puzzles me a

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,000
great deal, because it clearly transcends issues of just the social

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,120
community, but that seems to be a good defining point to start from. Okay, so

33
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,480
where we ended up there with was this puzzle. We finished at the end of

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,600
depression looking at evolutionary aspects and looking at there may be some

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,600
hidden benefits, that weird argument in one of the readings in your reader

36
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,040
creativity and aspects of manic depression going hand in hand, but we were

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,720
left with somewhat of a puzzle at the end of the schizophrenia lecture. Why

38
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,040
might there have been selection for these genes? Because once again, we start

39
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,080
off with a theme from the very beginning. Ooh, genes being selected for. Why

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,200
did the giraffe have long necks? Because this is a trait that's adaptive. In our

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,040
Darwinian terms, this is a trait that's associated with leaving more copies of

42
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,800
your genes. In future generations, what is the adaptive value for genes for

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,520
schizophrenia? Because we looked at the fact that in this contemporary form,

44
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,760
schizophrenia is by definition a maladaptive trait. Schizophrenics leave

45
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,120
fewer copies of their genes than their unaffected siblings. It is a trait which

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,000
is formally maladaptive. What might be a hidden advantage lurking there? And

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,160
where we left at the very end of that was just a hint that, in fact, as far as

48
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,080
anyone can tell, there are no hidden advantages to schizophrenia. There may

49
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,560
not be any adaptive advantage. What I left you with there was the notion,

50
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,840
however, that there might be another disease lurking around related to

51
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,680
schizophrenia, which does have an adaptive advantage. And to begin here, what we

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,200
have to go back to is one of the basic ninth grade biology concepts in science

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,360
there, which is the whole notion that, some of the time, a genetic trait, which

54
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,320
is god-awful in one setting, may have some advantages elsewhere. And we all

55
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,400
learned the exact same example back in ninth grade, sickle cell anemia. Sickle

56
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,480
cell anemia, which in one context, when fully expressed, is a hematological

57
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,600
disaster. Absolutely bad news, horrible. And in other settings, can protect you

58
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,600
against malaria and not by chance that versions of sickle cell anemia have

59
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,680
evolved in sub-Saharan Africa, Mediterranean areas, Thalassemia related

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,160
diseases, that this has been a frequent solution. Also in passing, showing us one

61
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,200
of the truisms from this class, there's no such thing as a bad gene. There's only

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,280
a bad gene environment interaction. Okay, so this theme in medical genetics comes

63
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,360
through a lot of times. Genetic traits, which in one setting are bad news, may

64
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,560
have advantages in another setting. And it's turning out, this is a theme in

65
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,880
lots of different realms of genetics. Other examples, Tay-Sachs disease. Tay-Sachs,

66
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,200
horrible congenital disorder, predominantly found in Ashkenazi Jews. What you

67
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,640
wind up getting there is full-blown version, complete cortical failure to

68
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,720
develop. A child is massively retarded and birth dies shortly afterward. Partial

69
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,320
version of Tay-Sachs disease and you're resistant to tuberculosis. Nobody knows

70
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,200
the mechanism for it yet. People absolutely understand why the sickle cell

71
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,880
trait both sets you up for an anemia and protection from malaria. Nobody

72
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,160
understands it yet with Tay-Sachs, but this explains one of the phenomena back

73
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,560
from the Middle Ages, the European belief that Jews were safe from tuberculosis

74
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,720
because they were poisoning the Christian wells. And that was a cause of a large

75
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,480
number of programs back when there is a genetic explanation, which is the trait

76
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,520
for Tay-Sachs disease in this partially expressed form protects from

77
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,120
tuberculosis. More examples of this. Cystic fibrosis, the most common congenital

78
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,720
disorder these days, and that is massively life-threatening.

79
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,720
A copy finished, so I would need a code to make a...

80
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,720
A code. Anybody know a code?

81
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,720
By Wednesday. Do you have no where the handout is?

82
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
They're not Xerox.

83
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Are they sitting there though?

84
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,320
Cystic fibrosis, full-blown version disastrous disease. What you get in

85
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,120
cystic fibrosis is inflammatory disease. Your lungs fill up with fluid. You often

86
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,280
are dead by age 20. Horrible disease. Partial version of cystic fibrosis and you

87
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,600
are protected against cholera. And the exact same mechanism that causes an

88
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,680
imbalance of fluids in the lungs is the same mechanism that keeps you from

89
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,640
losing all your fluids when you have cholera of dehydrating, highly adaptive.

90
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:43,160
A theme that keeps popping up over and over. Full-blown version, bad news, partial

91
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,840
genetic version, good news. And what you wind up getting is this basic argument,

92
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,800
a numerical argument, very similar to the, I'll lay down my life for two

93
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,440
brothers or eight cousins deal, of if you've got enough people with the

94
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,120
partial protective adaptive version, you can afford the occasional cousin with

95
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,560
the full-blown version. The trait overall will still be passed on. Now what this

96
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,120
sets us up for is thinking about whether something like this is going on with

97
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,280
schizophrenia. And the question to ask of course is, what is a mild genetic version

98
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,080
of schizophrenia? And this one got discovered in the 1970s. Back to that

99
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,920
classic study we've heard about in a couple of different lectures by now,

100
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,840
Kedi, that psychiatrist from Harvard, who with his colleagues went off to Denmark

101
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,080
and spent a decade there looking at every single adoption case and looking at

102
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,920
the patterns of schizophrenia, the schizophrenic, the adoptive parents, the

103
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,400
biological parents. In the course of them doing this, they discovered something

104
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,200
amazing. Because think about what these guys did. This was this team of

105
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,560
psychiatrists who spent a decade in Denmark. What they did was interview every

106
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,040
single family of every adoptee in Denmark. This was like 10,000 people. This

107
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,680
was a massive amount of work looking for schizophrenics, looking in the various

108
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,960
pedigrees, all that sort of thing, interviewing huge numbers of people,

109
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,760
just a handful of these folks, so they would all get the diagnostic criteria

110
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,360
fairly similar. Well-designed study, blah blah. What had they done by the end of a

111
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,520
decade? They had talked to more family members of schizophrenics than any

112
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,080
psychiatrists in history. And think about this. Your average psychiatrist who's

113
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,560
got some schizophrenic patients will, you know, meet once every six months with

114
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,720
the parent. If the schizophrenic is on the young side, maybe occasionally will

115
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,320
also have sessions on a regular basis. These people had just interviewed tens of

116
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,600
thousands of family members of schizophrenics. And they noticed something

117
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,520
interesting. They noticed that on the average, there was something a little bit

118
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,400
strange about family members of schizophrenics. Not all of them, and these

119
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,880
traits are not only found amongst family members of schizophrenics, but at a

120
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,760
higher than expected rate, there is a weird sort of quirky personality that

121
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,720
went with family members of schizophrenics, biological family members. And this

122
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,080
version of a much milder case of schizophrenia is now called schizotypal

123
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,400
personality. This is a standardly recognized disorder in psychiatry,

124
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,960
schizotypalism is a mild genetic version of schizophrenia. What does schizotypal

125
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:25,120
look like? First off, people have somewhat loose associations, not remotely in the

126
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,040
realm of a schizophrenic, and there are standardized scales that can be given to

127
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,040
show this is someone out of the normal range, but not in the schizophrenic range

128
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,480
in an intermediate range. In addition, you get a social withdrawal. And this is

129
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,640
not the complete dysfunctional, unable to hold down a job locked up in the back

130
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,080
of the village version of schizophrenia. This is someone instead who just

131
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,840
gravitates towards fairly solitary occupations. This is the lighthouse keeper,

132
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,120
this is the fire tower watcher, this is the classic schizotypal occupation,

133
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,880
this is the person sitting alone in the projection room in the movie theater

134
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,440
eight hours a night in the dark there, classic sort of schizotypal jobs,

135
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,120
socially detached, very solitary. The most striking feature of schizotypals

136
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,240
is what is termed metamagical thinking. And this is where things begin to get

137
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,800
interesting. Metamagical thinking, this is not someone who is thought disordered,

138
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,120
psychotic, unable to function, this is someone who just kind of believes in

139
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,400
strange things. This is someone who's really, really into science fiction and fantasy.

140
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,840
This is someone, okay, I see some of the concern popping up here. This is someone

141
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,200
who's into some sort of new age stuff in a really frenzy sort of way. This is

142
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,640
someone who believes in mental telepathy or UFOs. This is a first hint. This is

143
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,200
someone who, if they have a religious structure of belief, has an extremely

144
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,800
concrete level of interpretation. Remembering this seems to be quite similar

145
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,280
to schizophrenia, what apples oranges have in common multi-syllabic words,

146
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,200
that concreteness at the level of abstraction. These are people who tend

147
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,200
towards extremely fundamentalist, concrete interpretations of religious events.

148
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,520
Seven-day creation of the world, this is not a metaphor, this is not a parable,

149
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,000
this could be measured down to the minute. People alive who were once dead,

150
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,720
this is not a metaphor for keeping the spirit going. This is an exact description

151
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,680
of the events we begin to see where we're heading here. What schizotypillism is

152
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,040
about is it's a very mild version of schizophrenia in terms of the loose

153
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,200
associations, in terms of the concreteness of associations, the social

154
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,520
detachment, and most of all the metamagical thinking. This is now a

155
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,880
standard diagnostic category in psychiatry to have a schizotypal personality.

156
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,120
So, what we then ask is, where does this come from? What is this like? And what we

157
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,400
have to ask is of course our usual question when trying to make sense of

158
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,760
a human trait is recognizing 99% of human history was not spent with schizotypills

159
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,080
being able to get jobs in film projection rooms. What does schizotypillism look

160
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,200
like in traditional non-westernized human societies? And the answer to that

161
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,640
turns out to have been floating around for 60, 70 years in the anthropology literature.

162
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,960
And this is back to the 1930s. An anthropologist named Paul Raiden, who was

163
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,560
the first one to point this out, was the first one of a whole tradition

164
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,720
emphasizing what was a pretty strong area of research in the 1940s in

165
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,480
anthropology. He was the first person who pointed out that in

166
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,600
traditional human societies, there is a category of people there who count as,

167
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,800
and these are his exact words, half crazy. Who are the half crazies in

168
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,680
traditional human society? The shamans, the witch doctors, the

169
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,120
medicine men, the medicine women. These are members of

170
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,440
society who make a living being metamagical. And

171
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,920
Raiden was the first one to emphasize this. In traditional human societies,

172
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,960
the shamans are the ones who converse with the dead for ritualistic reasons. The

173
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,200
shamans are the ones who speak in tongues. The shamans are the ones who

174
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,520
at the full moon turn into the hyena to protect the village from predators.

175
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,840
The shamans are the ones who are metamagical for a thing, for a living.

176
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,200
And this has been a theme in anthropology for quite some time.

177
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,040
One anthropologist named Akternek referred to

178
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,840
shamans as being healed madmen. In the 1940s, anthropologists named

179
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,200
Krober, who started the Anthra Department in Berkeley and was one of the

180
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,560
grand old men in the field. This is a quote of his describing what

181
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,480
shamanism is about. The shaman displays his possession by

182
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,440
a spirit by publicly reenacting his specific

183
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,360
personal experience, that of a man suffering from a particular mental

184
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,720
affliction. His projections, his hallucinations,

185
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,800
his journey through space and time thus became a dramatic ritual

186
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,000
and served as the prototype for all future concepts

187
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,800
of the religious road of perfection. And this was the recognition in the 30s and

188
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,880
40s that what shamanism is about is a very controlled,

189
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,000
very socially contextual version of metamagical schizotypillism.

190
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,640
The word did not exist in the field at the time,

191
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,120
but that is what it is. Now what Krober emphasized in his writing was

192
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,040
these are not schizophrenics. And what we heard about in that story in

193
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,800
class four days ago, looking at that schizophrenic

194
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,400
person in that messiah village, is that people in traditional human

195
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,280
societies are no more tolerant to the mentally ill

196
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,040
than we are in the West and just as delighted to find cultural means

197
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,960
to peripheralize them, these are not full-blown schizophrenics.

198
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,400
These are not people who suddenly are speaking in tongues

199
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,560
at the exact silent moment in the hunt. These are people who are speaking in

200
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,400
tongues at the right time. These are people who are hearing voices

201
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,080
at the right time and you remember what the punchline was of that story

202
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,200
about that schizophrenic woman in that messiah village was

203
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,080
she heard voices at the wrong time. Hearing voices at the right time

204
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,000
is not schizophrenia, it is a version of schizotypillism.

205
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,240
And what you see when you look at the human tradition of shamanism,

206
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,080
these are not peripheralized people. These are some of the most powerful

207
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,200
members of society. Many societies have a tradition

208
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,440
of shamans being celibate, but many of them, most of them as it turns out,

209
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,400
do not. And these are people who are anything but

210
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,160
reproductively maladaptive. These are people who have been passing on their

211
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,400
genes just fine throughout history. Shamanism, this mild

212
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,360
version, this contextually appropriate version of

213
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,520
metamagicalism has done wonderfully throughout human history.

214
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,600
And a great example of that, the fact that you need to get it just right,

215
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,760
was Krober sort of emphasizing this, that in the right setting,

216
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,360
what would be an absolutely peripheralizing set of traits

217
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,880
instead makes you a very powerful, very sanctioned,

218
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,040
and that's the word that he used, a very sanctioned member of society,

219
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,480
and it's not for nothing that the word sanction has a whole lot to do with the

220
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,840
word sanctuary. This is a realm in which the exact same

221
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,160
traits would spectacularly fail to work in other cultural settings,

222
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,400
do it right, and it works just fine. And Krober had a wonderful anecdote about

223
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,360
this, this sense of you got to get it just right.

224
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,760
He apparently was at some ritual, a ceremony, he spent most of his time

225
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,480
doing his anthropology with Native American groups,

226
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,720
and this was some ceremony being done by the Winnebago's, and I was actually

227
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,080
found it quite bizarre that there was a group called the Winnebago,

228
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,040
but hanging out with the Winnebago's, and this was one of his

229
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,040
informants there sort of explaining this ritual, and this was apparently some

230
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,280
really fraughty, really quite over-the-top ritual that the Shaman was

231
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,280
pulling off and was speaking in tongues and rolling on the fire, and all of that

232
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,360
and this guy said, that is great, we've got this Shaman here, this guy is

233
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,240
like the best, he's worth every dollar we pay him,

234
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,840
this guy is terrific, we are so lucky to have a Shaman like this in our village,

235
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,880
this guy is, thank god we don't have two of them though,

236
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,560
two way too much, one's just fine, and you have this recognition that

237
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,000
this is not schizophrenia, you wouldn't want a person to be

238
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,920
schizophrenic because they will be as peripheralized as in our own society,

239
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,800
you want to get it just right, you don't want to have too many of them,

240
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,720
you've got to have some people who are some plain meat and potatoes, good hunters,

241
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,760
that sort of thing, and you want the ratio of that to the Shamanistic

242
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,400
metamagical folks to be quite high, but you need a few of them around,

243
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,920
and what the anthropologists have been noting for 60 years is

244
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,960
all human cultures traditionally have some very metamagical folks around,

245
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,160
and these folks are anything but peripheralized with a decreased

246
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,480
reproductive success, they're some of the most honored members of society.

247
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,120
So what you wind up getting here is that classic partially expressed sort of continuum deal going on

248
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,840
which is human societies throughout history have had such a need for shamans

249
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,520
that they can put up with the occasional second cousin who's fully schizophrenic,

250
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,280
as long as you've got the ratio right, and what the numbers suggest,

251
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,120
the 1 to 2 percent rate of schizophrenia throughout human cultures

252
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,480
and the number average population size of human villages

253
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,200
and the number of shamans it works about right. Throughout history there has been more of a

254
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,640
predominance of schizotypal shamans than of schizophrenics you can afford to put up with

255
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,680
the occasional cousin. Now where does this wind up heading? What the main point of this section is

256
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,960
about is this is not just about the people naked in the National Geographics with the bones on their

257
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,880
noses, and this was a critical transition recognizing this. At some point a whole lot of people in

258
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,280
that field were writing about the primitiveness of non-westernized religion, and there was a great

259
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,560
quote who came up with this one, a guy named Devereux referred to primitive religion as being

260
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:00,000
organized schizophrenia. This was somebody in the 1940s exactly getting this flavor of contextualized

261
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,360
appropriate hearing the voices at the right time, all of that, but this was overwhelmingly literature

262
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,080
about the weird stuff those folks are up to in the night and the time life specials on public

263
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,240
television and what the critical transition is is it's not just about them. At some point this

264
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,280
anthropologist Ackernick who was quite leftist in his orientation wrote a long essay saying how

265
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,040
incredibly culturally chauvinistic it was of the western anthropologists to write all these articles

266
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:33,760
about how shamans are half healed madmen and how condescending that was to talk about those cultures

267
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,920
as being so irrationally based in contrast to us and what's the obvious punchline is the problem

268
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,560
isn't saying that they're irrational when we're saying that we aren't but it's saying that we're

269
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,600
equally irrational. We are equally irrational in some of the tenets that we have here. A quote

270
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,600
from Ackernick at the time was our culture is unique and outlawing the irrational. Let me give

271
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:02,880
you some recent statistics from a survey. What's the name of the survey? The main national survey

272
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,920
of people. Who? Yes Gallipole that guy the Gallipole a recent Gallipole survey I don't know about you

273
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:17,200
guys but these numbers astonished me 25 percent of Americans say they believe in ghosts 36 percent

274
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,560
believe in mental telepathy 47 percent believe in UFOs and more than 50 percent of Americans believe

275
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:31,120
in the devil and a belief that the devil influences daily activities these are people who can vote

276
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,400
these are people who can serve on juries these are people who can operate motor vehicles these

277
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,760
are people making decisions about medical interventions I for one in this outpost of not

278
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,280
terribly extreme irrationality in this corner of the country I'm astonished we live in a world that

279
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,760
is highly irrational and the punchline of this is this is not simply about non-western traditional

280
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,920
human societies the exact same thread of schizotypillism runs throughout all of the belief systems

281
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:06,400
of human societies including western ones we are permeated by irrationality now some of the versions

282
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,760
of it that we have in the west are utter nonsense ones ones that have just been like invented out of

283
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,920
thin air in recent years which is kind of like fast food for these sort of Nuvo sort of medieval

284
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,960
peasants in their hot tubs up in Marin this is the world of crystals and channeling and things

285
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,000
of that sort but some of the versions of our westernized irrationally go back millennia

286
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,400
and organize some of our most cherished values the same irrationality and the same valuing

287
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,240
of those who invent the appropriate versions of the irrationality runs throughout the west

288
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,280
okay just to show you that I am not being overly hostile or will try to pull in my own sort of

289
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,040
tradition that I was raised in is not normally considered a sign of robust mental health to

290
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,960
hear voices coming out of burning bushes this is considered a worrisome sign this is considered

291
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,320
diagnostic it is not a good thing to be reporting that you just spent the night wrestling an angel

292
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,360
it is usually a very disturbing sign if you were reporting you've had a conversation with someone

293
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,560
who is dead and has risen from the grave these are diagnosable problems in our secular western realm

294
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:21,120
these are the backbones of our belief systems we in the west as well as we humans in non-westernized

295
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,040
settings schizotypillism runs through all of human history what you wind up having then

296
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,320
is this obvious question who invented this stuff who came up with the notion that the world was

297
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,600
invented in seven days or snakes with apples are up to something no good or it's possible to give

298
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,640
birth and you're still a virgin these were not designed by committees these were designed by

299
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,400
extremely formative extremely influential schizotypals throughout history yes

300
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,840
yep it's genetic evidence those same studies showed that it runs through the adoption studies

301
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,800
showed it's a biological trait it runs through the biological side of the adoptive pedigrees

302
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:09,680
it's a it's a genetic trait what the new studies are now being to show is mild tendency towards

303
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,960
increased dopamine tone mild tendency towards most of the biology we heard about what we're

304
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:22,000
seeing is totally artificial bucket to say schizophrenia up to here past the side non-schizophrenic

305
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,720
we have this in-between zone like everything else we've been thinking about it's on a continuum

306
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,520
and seems to be the same biology in a much milder form question somewhere there

307
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,240
yep same sort of stuff okay so what do you wind up yeah question

308
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,240
yep

309
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,760
no because the the critical thing there is they will very readily tell you much as people will

310
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,520
tell you here in their own schizotypal experiences that you need the right person to lead it they

311
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,360
can't get that going without the right shaman starting it off you need them as a catalyst yeah

312
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:25,920
okay why do we need this why do we value this okay we'll come to this probably in about two

313
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:32,800
days but this is tapping into all of the you know why why do we search for some fairly

314
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,680
unlikely answers to the big questions that plague all of us we'll come to this in two days but you

315
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,560
know this is getting at the core of some of the basic questions here okay let me push on here

316
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:48,160
what you wind up seeing with this is that this is on a continuum and who invented this stuff and

317
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:54,000
you look throughout the history of religious leaders those who have invented some of the theology

318
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,640
and we will come to different variants of religious leaders shortly as you see those who invented

319
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,880
the theology that there is very often a thread of metamagical thinking that goes through this

320
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,800
and this is metamagical thinking of a type that falls readily into the spectrum of schizotypalism

321
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:16,640
now one of the themes we've endlessly come back to in this class is appropriate context appropriate

322
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,480
context and this is a perfect realm to see this because what we wind up getting is you got to

323
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,080
get it just right if you hear voices it's got to be during the ceremony if you're speaking in tongues

324
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,320
it can't be in the middle of the silent part of the hunt you don't want to have too many of them

325
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,520
thank god we've got this shaman but not two of them around here you've got to get the context right

326
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,360
and what we've seen throughout human history and western history as well is get it wrong and we

327
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,120
have names for these things get it wrong and these are abortive religious fringe groups these are

328
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,160
cults and you look at some versions of this in our own recent time you look at david koresh and

329
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,480
waco you look at someone like james jinn jones and jones town you look at someone like charles

330
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,160
manson and these are people who were highly metamagical in their thinking highly charismatic

331
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:11,520
but hit a wall at the point where we still classify them as cults manson is a diagnosed

332
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,960
schizophrenic with the other two there's only post hoc sort of sort of forensic psychiatry

333
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,960
that you can do what you wind up getting is get it wrong and we call it a cult get it right in the

334
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,600
right time in the right place and maybe for the next couple of millennia people won't have to go

335
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,000
to work on your birthday if you get it exactly right in that setting so what i think we see here is

336
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,240
a setting here for making sense the exact same traits in a different context to use krober's

337
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,560
words in a cultural context that is not sanctioned the exact same traits count as psychiatrically

338
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,880
suspect these days what this is about is not only if you get it in the right context is it okay

339
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,720
it is highly honored tapping into the question that came in before that all human societies have a

340
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,280
strong need for a certain degree of these folks around you need to get the ratios right okay

341
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,160
picking up on this theme a transition to a next point in the sense that this is talking about

342
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,600
sort of the structural steel of religious belief what are the basic beliefs you have

343
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,480
there is no god but one he is a la the you know whatever versions of the central formats you have

344
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,920
there is a trinity i am who i am any of these variants these are sort of the building blocks the

345
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:34,160
structural steel of religion but what religion is often often also about is lots of other things

346
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:40,000
we have a very modern very westernized view of religion these days what religion is often about

347
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,840
is the social community that it brings you what religion is often about is the motivation for

348
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,240
good works throughout most of history what religion is about in one very orthodox variant is the

349
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,480
carrying out of rituals the daily performance of ritualistic behaviors in the context of religion

350
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,800
and this transitions us to the next subject in here and this whole notion of ritualism as a backbone

351
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,560
of religion wonderful quote to that effect henry ward beecher father of harry and beecher stowe

352
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:16,960
famous protestant preacher in new england i think the 1830s or so had this quote at the time religion

353
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,720
is daily bread religion is not just cake on sunday the notion that what religion is about

354
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:29,440
is the small acts god is in the detail religion is in the small acts of the daily rituals now

355
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,360
beginning to look not at the large theological notions our religion believes there are multiple

356
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,880
gods there are virgin births that god can speak through a burning bush but instead religion as

357
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,720
the daily practices of ritual now what is interesting about this what comes through with this is

358
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,440
another theme another subtype of a very mild version of a psychiatric disorder which once

359
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,320
again works spectacularly when you get it just right not now with the metamagical big theology

360
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,240
building blocks of religion but the daily bits and pieces of ritualism and this brings in another

361
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,240
psychiatric disorder one we haven't talked about much in class so far okay i guarantee on a regular

362
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,320
basis all of us in this room getting to some point where it's some anxious period you've got some

363
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,160
major deadline you're applying for some summer something rather that you really want to get

364
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,240
you're totally uptight about it you're sitting down and you're writing the essay and before you

365
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,400
can write the essay you got to get your favorite pen it's got to be right there and you got to

366
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,480
rearrange your desk and you got to get everything sorted out and finally you finish it and you go

367
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,200
mail off the application you know you put in the mailbox and you check again to make sure it went

368
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,440
down and this is really important you don't want to see it check again just to make sure and you're

369
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,080
all set for that and you finally there's no one else around so you go and you look in front of it

370
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,680
and looking back at that and that sort of thing i mean we all do this actually maybe we all do this

371
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:57,680
and i'm embarrassing myself horribly but my bet is most of us do this sort of thing we fall into

372
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:04,880
obsessive little rituals during times of anxiety we also have rituals intrusive thoughts that just

373
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,480
invade our heads at times where they are of no obvious purpose they are at the cost of thinking

374
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,000
anything more clearly it's totally maddening and you can't stop the thoughts for example today i'm

375
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
working on a paper that's involving all sorts of very deep ruminative thought and figuring out all

376
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,720
sorts of data stuff and i've made no progress on it at all this morning because for some reason

377
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,520
that i don't understand at all all of today i've had the damn theme song from teletubbies going

378
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,360
and i can't stop it especially the part where lala leaps up and says lala the really cute part

379
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,040
there and i can't stop doing this and i don't know what's going on i did not plan to lose today's

380
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:48,800
productivity because of teletubbies but we get this some stupid jingle that's stuck in your head

381
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,080
you find yourself going up a flight of stairs and you can't stop yourself from counting the steps

382
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:00,320
we do this we all do this and we tend to do it more often during periods of anxiety and the

383
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:07,200
interpretation of that is that we impose this totally arbitrary useless destructive structure

384
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,040
at a time when everything else feels like you're walking on quicksand we all do this as some sort

385
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:19,280
of adaptation to periods of anxiety and what we transition into now is talking about a psychiatric

386
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:25,680
disorder where people do this all the time and it not only gets in the way of them getting some work

387
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:31,840
done on a project that requires some concentration this is a disorder that absolutely destroys their

388
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:39,520
lives this is ocd obsessive compulsive disorder and the full blown version of it bears so little

389
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,880
resemblance to what any of us do when we are having to get the pen right and checking the mailbox

390
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,560
the third time and having the jingle go through your head for a while it is of such a scale larger

391
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,000
it is so much more destructive it is virtually unimaginable from our perspective people with

392
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,120
ocd have their lives completely destroyed by this disorder people with ocd in the full blown version

393
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,040
spent six hours a day washing their hands the characteristic that's always at the top of the

394
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:16,000
list with ocd is this obsessive focusing on hygiene is worried that you are constantly in some way

395
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,480
soiled six hours a day of washing these are people who cannot hold down jobs their marriages come

396
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,720
apart their relationships are destroyed because they cannot stop washing and you have in the reader

397
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:35,360
one profile of somebody with ocd from a book entitled the boy who couldn't stop washing this is the

398
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:42,000
symptom that always pops up at the top of the list and the actual washing process is ritualistic

399
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,680
beyond belief these are people who have bought seven different kinds of antibacterial soap

400
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,480
they go through this whole sequence the water has to be a certain temperature for the first level of

401
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,160
washing then a certain type of towel that they dry themselves off with that towel has to be put out

402
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,120
of the room because it's dirty then then the next layer of washing with the next soap go through two

403
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,880
hours of this they're finally done turn to leave to go to their job go to their whatever and on the

404
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,720
way out brush their elbow against the door and they have to start all over again and you will

405
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,080
stop them at that point and say you will miss this interview you will not get this job and they will

406
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,400
say yes i know but i'm not going to be able to function and i'm just it's dirty i know my elbow

407
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,440
i know i'm going to touch it then and then i'll get in my face and i just have to start over i'm

408
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,760
not going to be able to get anything done today anyway so i need to go wash if i don't wash i'm

409
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,600
not going to be able to and back they go and hours and hours of this people with ocd spend half

410
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,160
their waking hours doing this people with ocd just have constant sequences of numbers going in their

411
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:55,120
heads constant jingles intrusive thoughts they cannot stop thinking what if i don't stop the car

412
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,480
at the next stop sign what if i run down this person they have the intrusive thoughts of i'm

413
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,600
absolutely sure i struck somebody at that street crossing back there i've got to go back and check

414
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,400
okay they don't see anybody there they drive on five miles down the road

415
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,320
probably the person flew off into the bushes i have to go back and check i have to go back

416
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,360
and check they can never leave their home because they've left the door unlocked they go back they

417
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,400
check the door is locked they have to go back they left the gas on they left the light on this is

418
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:32,320
absolutely paralyzing intrusive thoughts what if i leaned over and struck the person next to me

419
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,760
what if somebody kills my loved ones you can't stop the thoughts they just keep coming at these

420
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,920
people they cannot enter or leave a place there is a paralysis about entering and leaving built

421
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,680
around this sort of almost magical exclusionary power that you get a transition into a place

422
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:56,080
they cannot enter a room until they do a prime number of tapings on the wall before entering

423
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,720
they can then not enter the room until if that's prime number and then a different prime number

424
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:07,920
with their left foot shaking completely arbitrary symptoms of having to enter and leave numerology

425
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,920
these people cannot begin a meal until the utensils are absolutely symmetrical and lined up and

426
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,200
they're never perfectly symmetrical and the entering and leaving ritual is never done right

427
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,000
and they certainly can't enter the classroom unless the number of steps from here to the door

428
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,920
is two times an interval that's with this a very mathematical quality to it and it's never quite

429
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,720
right and you've got to do it all over again and what's been pointed out one of the really

430
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,040
interesting sort of insights as to what ocd is about is that this is an anxiety disorder this

431
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,760
is a pathological attempt to impose structure to impose predictability to impose control

432
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,640
in a world where everything is pathologically provoking of a sense of dis ease and uncertainty

433
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,840
and anxiety and the absolute horrifying version of ocd that i've heard described is this metaphor

434
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,520
where this is straight out of ethology this is a fixed action pattern we all know the fixed action

435
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,280
pattern of a dog is settling down at night on its blanket and what does the dog do it circles a few

436
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,400
times before it settles down but then it circles a couple of more times and just as it's ready to

437
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,720
then it circles a few more and fine and you can see at some point the dog doesn't even want to do

438
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,800
this anymore and it takes a while longer in another 30 seconds before the dog can finally escape from

439
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:37,520
this fixed action pattern and sit down in ocd the person never ever escapes the person spends forever

440
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:44,000
circling on the blanket being unable to finally lie down and rest because they are just consumed

441
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,160
with these rituals with these obsessive intrusive thoughts and what you get is this is completely

442
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:57,040
paralyzing okay here's an example of an obsessive belief that we all have okay can anybody identify this

443
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,000
okay here's what it is this is an aerial view in fact it's a satellite photograph of here

444
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,760
this is a tray of rice crispy treats and you've just walked into the room and it looks like this

445
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,240
and for a huge percentage of us within a minute or so it's going to look like this

446
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,720
because we all feel this compulsive need to take a knife and cut off that edge okay let me just

447
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,720
canvas you on all of that okay how many of you okay how many of you do this for starters i certainly

448
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:37,280
do okay how many of you have those who do this cut off this bit here because it doesn't really count

449
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,720
on your diet okay a couple of hands how many of you cut it off because what's perfectly obvious is

450
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,520
going from this to this decreases the total perimeter so that it will stay fresher that way

451
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:56,320
okay problems that how many of you wind up doing it because it's just getting at you that

452
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,200
it's the knife's just there and you just have to cut it off and smooth out the edge yes that's why

453
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,760
we all do it and then what you then decide is that there's this little bump here which requires you

454
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,200
to trim this out and then there's a little bump and off you go with that and we all wind up doing

455
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:17,600
that but if this is what you did around the clock for your entire life it would destroy it and what

456
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,600
is most striking with people with ocd is you could never go through the sequence i just did

457
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:29,840
there's no insight the person does not sit there and say help there's something wrong with me i feel

458
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:36,160
this need to wash my hands six hours a day they say help there's something wrong with me i can never

459
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:44,400
get clean i'm just so dirty everything i do makes me dirty there's no insight into it okay so where

460
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,320
does this fit in again our modern version of religion our modern very secularly influenced

461
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:57,200
version of religion so often involves an emphasis on what religion is about is counseling the trouble

462
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,680
what religion is about is holding the hands of the newlyweds and making sure they understand

463
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,960
what they're getting into what religion is about is comforting the distance the bereaved what religion

464
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,480
is about is the good works but this is not what religion has often been about throughout history

465
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,680
often the religious leaders are not necessarily the ones who are most psychotherapeutically

466
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,040
minded or the most galvanizing of people into the good works often religious leaders have been

467
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,080
the ones at the head of a crusade often religious leaders have been the ones with the most vivid

468
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,440
images of what hell and damnation would be like but often what religious leaders have been are the

469
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,080
people who are best at doing the rituals and that has been another thread of religious practice

470
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:46,720
throughout history of religious leaders as often being among the most fervent the most accomplished

471
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,680
at carrying out of rituals now let me give you a sense of this because as i began to read more

472
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,040
on this this absolutely astonished me because i knew very little about this stuff just the scale

473
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,640
of this and starting off with what will probably be a fairly alien religion for most of you in here

474
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,800
and then moving into examples closer to home looking at orthodox very traditional hinduism

475
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:15,200
looking at the behaviors of a brahman an individual who devotes their entire life to ritualistic

476
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:22,640
practice in pursuit of their religion a brahman a highly observant brahman spends six hours a day

477
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:29,040
in cleansing rituals and there are detailed rules as to which hand you wash in what sequence

478
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,640
how many times you wash each hand separately how many each one together the sequence with which

479
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,320
you wash out one side of your mouth versus the other with water there are set rules for brahmans

480
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:46,160
as to how you were supposed to lie down at night dictating what your first sight is in the morning

481
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,360
there are set rules as to what direction you must face when defecating in terms of what you

482
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,720
were looking at at the time there are set rules for rituals you have to do when entering a temple

483
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,880
when leaving a temple there are set rules for how many breaths you take through each nostril

484
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,080
you close one nostril during your prayers for a certain number of breaths then you close the other

485
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:13,840
and all of these are very carefully stipulated the number of mouthfuls of food the number of

486
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:20,320
times you chew per mouthful the number of prayers you have to say per day sequences of magic numbers

487
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:26,880
all of this is absolutely spelled out and orthodox brahmans consume their entire days doing this

488
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,880
okay next example orthodox Judaism spectacularly yeah question

489
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,120
great okay hang on for a while we will come to that that's a superb question as to why they seem

490
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:50,960
to have lots to do with cleansing and food preparation wow thank you okay do you want to

491
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,800
why don't we take a five minute break right now and you can all store in the front here for handouts

492
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:07,040
lots of opinions here lots of thoughts once again that same thing i mentioned two days ago three days

493
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:13,200
ago whenever this is very provocative stuff take advantage of the course website put up some of

494
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,280
your opinions get dial-ons going on this because people lots of times have extremely strong opinions

495
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,320
on this and very interesting ones take advantage of this a couple of questions that just came up

496
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:29,520
how come people with ocd don't come down with learned helplessness why aren't they depressed

497
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:37,280
because part of the fuel behind ocd is you're always convinced aha one more now i know instead of

498
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:44,240
doing it 17 times 18 if i do it 18 then it's going to be perfect you've always just figured out

499
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,360
not only do i have to do the six hours of washing but make sure i never step on a crack and then i

500
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:54,560
won't break my mother's back you're always figuring out the next step then pointing out we're about to

501
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,320
go in a direction where what are the advantages of a mild version of ocd and we're discussing this

502
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,920
in a religious context i should point out in a secular context there's a tremendous advantage

503
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,720
to a mild version of ocd what it does is get you into a place like stanford what it does is work

504
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,720
to a tremendous advantage given how regimented and disciplined a lot of folks are in here get it in

505
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,480
the right context blah blah that theme that we have again and again okay shifting over just seeing

506
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:31,360
orthodox brahman belief and hinduism absolutely dominated virtually full time with ritualistic

507
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:38,960
behaviors orthodox jewelry a spectacular number of laws built around food preparation the kosher

508
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:45,360
laws very detailed rules as to how long of a time interval between eating one type of food and another

509
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:51,440
type of food if you inadvertently mix up the silverware with different types of food ritualistic

510
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,720
cleansing rituals that you have to go through involving putting the utensils in dirt for months

511
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:03,120
on end and special prayers that have to be said rules about how you enter and leave a holy place

512
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:08,480
involving certain prayers involving a certain ritualistic touching that you have to make on the

513
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:15,920
door jam there all sorts of magic numbers the number 18 has magical powers and orthodox Judaism

514
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,160
and it's built around numbers of times you have to say a prayer multiples of 18 you have these prayer

515
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,520
shawls that have strings on the end which have 18 knots in them and they have to be pulled a certain

516
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:34,720
number of times here's one of the amazing examples of ritualism okay these numbers have magical powers

517
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:42,080
and orthodox Judaism and you will note 365 is the number of days in the year 248 is the number of

518
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:47,040
bones that people believed were in the bodies during the middle ages when this evolved and together

519
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:57,280
613 according to the holy books there are 613 rules for daily behaviors 365 prohibitions every day

520
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,560
248 things that have to be done every day the preponderance of the prohibitions leading one

521
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,520
clearly fairly depressive rabbi back when to be saying obviously it would have been better if

522
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,440
none of us were born given the fact that there were more things that we could mess up by doing

523
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,800
but what you see here is which is highly ritualistic the number of prohibitions equaling the number of

524
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,400
days of the year the number of ritual constraints equaling the number of bones in the body 613

525
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,840
is the magic number okay where did these numbers come from very often in religious rituals what

526
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:34,480
you find is a number has symbolic value because it's got a certain appeal for making learning

527
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:41,680
easier it is not by chance that a base 10 society came up with 10 commandments because 10 commandments

528
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,600
that are much easier to remember than 9 or 11 what are these about you would say okay well there's

529
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:53,120
some sort of ritualistic content here god the number of things god doesn't want us to do each day

530
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:57,120
is equal to the number of days of the year the number thing god wants us to do is equal to the

531
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:02,880
number of bones in the body okay great device for remembering the rules but here's the amazing

532
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,880
thing nobody knows the rules you look through thousands of pages of commentary stretching back

533
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:15,040
centuries and the rules aren't written down and various rabbis have made a living arguing over

534
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:21,360
what are the 365 things you aren't supposed to do each day in other words the numbers are more

535
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:28,080
important than the content the content is less critical than the fact that whatever they are

536
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:33,760
there's 365 things that god doesn't want you to do and whatever they are there's 248 that god

537
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,440
wants you to do the number that you are attributing to god is more important in that case than the

538
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:48,160
content okay classic classic obsessive numerology switching over traditional orthodox islam what

539
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:54,320
you find there is very detailed rules as to what foods you can eat what the first food is you're

540
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:00,320
supposed to eat each day there are rules as to how you enter and leave a holy place there are rules

541
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:07,120
for very ornate cleansing after release relieving yourself very very detailed rules when you are

542
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:13,360
washing out your mouth how many mouthfuls of water which hands you wash in which sequence the exact

543
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:19,920
same thing exact same rules as with an ocd person after the showering explicitly written down when

544
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,120
a man is washing himself at the ends of the at the end of the cleansing should he happen to touch

545
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:31,680
his penis he has to do the whole sequence all over again magic numbers thought to have powers there

546
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:38,800
seven ten seventy and a hundred apparently have magical powers in islam and you have very explicit

547
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:45,920
concrete instructions about them Muhammad himself wrote down that a man who says a prayer with clean

548
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:52,720
teeth gets seventy times the brownie points as a man saying his prayers without them multiples of

549
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:58,480
magic numbers with all of that and probably for most of you by now what will be the most familiar

550
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:04,720
is looking at orthodox christianity and you have rosaries in the counting of rosaries you have three

551
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,000
is a magic number you have very detailed numbers of times you are supposed to say prayers you have

552
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,040
rules for entering and leaving churches even in christian groups that are viewed as some of the

553
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,560
least ritualistic some of the most cerebral in some ways you look at the Lutherans Lutherans

554
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:26,720
have set rules for prayers that are only said during even years prayers that are only said during odd

555
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:33,440
years all of these versions of orthodoxy are absolutely shocked through with rituals built

556
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,200
around cleansing of the body food preparation entering and leaving of significant places

557
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:45,840
and numerology it's the exact same list as you find with ocd and Freud a hundred years ago

558
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:52,080
came up with this amazing quote to that regard Freud described obsessive compulsive disorder ocd

559
00:48:52,080 --> 00:49:01,440
quote as an individual religiosity and religion as a universal obsessional compulsion he absolutely

560
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,840
linked the two now just when you're thinking that i'm standing here and i'm started going to start

561
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:11,680
pathologizing religious belief from sort of a medical psychiatric standpoint the exact same

562
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:17,280
conclusion has been reached by religious leaders over the centuries as well in the 15th century

563
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:24,800
there was st. Loyola no st. Ignatius of Loyola and what this guy did was he wrote this long track

564
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:31,040
describing scrupulosity scrupulosity is not a common word in english anymore but it's opposite

565
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:37,520
certainly is being unscrupulous being scrupulous having scrupial scrupulosity at the time was

566
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:44,240
defined as someone who was going through religious ritual for its own sake someone who was not thinking

567
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,760
about the content but was just doing the ritual and he wrote this long track to catholic priest

568
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,520
saying watch out for people like these people who were coming and being super devout but you will

569
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:00,560
notice they're just doing the rituals without thinking of the content your job is to recognize

570
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:06,160
them and guide them back into actually focusing on the content they shouldn't be doing the rituals

571
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,760
for their own sake there's a danger of people like that showing up in the Talmud an orthodox

572
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,600
Judaism the exact same thing there is a law in there that when you read the holy book of Judaism

573
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:23,200
the Torah you were not allowed to do it by heart you have to actually read the words because there

574
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,200
is an injunction to think about the content don't do it in a rote way and Muhammad himself

575
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,800
in Islam wrote down that people who give prayers without thinking about the content the prayers

576
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:41,040
don't count even religious leaders for centuries for millennia have recognized the pull of religious

577
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:47,440
ritual for its own sake to have to admonish religious adherents to pay attention to the content

578
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:53,040
because the ritual takes on a life of its own where the numbers the content the ritual is more

579
00:50:53,040 --> 00:51:10,000
important than the actual thought behind it yeah

580
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:19,040
exactly and that was that point that transition talking about schizotypillism there's much more

581
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:26,000
resemblance to the large theological building blocks of religion of spirituality what are our

582
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,520
military's principles what do we believe do we believe you always follow orders you never follow

583
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:37,200
orders you don't agree with what's more important value sort of stuff this is instead in the realm of

584
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,920
religious practice and this is the realm of very orthodox religious practice absolutely

585
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,600
completely different realm so where am i heading with this obviously emphasizing the similarity

586
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:53,680
of the traits and that whole business that once again have a six hour compulsion to wash your

587
00:51:53,680 --> 00:52:00,720
hands each day and have it occur in the secular context of ocd it destroys your life you cannot

588
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:06,960
function in society you are peripheralized you are mentally ill and that exact same theme get it

589
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:13,200
right in the right context and this is protected this is honored this is rewarded get it in the

590
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:20,160
right setting now nothing about being able to do rituals and turn them from your own private ocd

591
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:26,720
into the religious setting this is not a process for making the anxiety go away it's very important

592
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,360
when people are pulling off these rituals in a religious setting it's not to make the anxiety

593
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:37,920
go away it's to share it it's to share it over time and space with a larger community it's to

594
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:44,800
take this nameless dread and to give it a name and to have that name come with feeding instructions

595
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,320
and all sorts of rules for how to please the source of the named dread at this point it's not to

596
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:57,440
make the anxiety go away it's to make the anxiety shared now from this transitioning from this notion

597
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:03,280
that okay in the right setting the same exact trait that can ruin your life can in fact be

598
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,840
enveloped rewarded welcomed protected in the context of religious belief now taking it one step

599
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:37,520
further yeah question sure no it definitely doesn't but from that standpoint this is

600
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,000
speaking to one aspect of what it's doing and we still haven't come to the question that was up

601
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,200
there before isn't there an ecological reason why there should be these rituals about cleansing

602
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,760
and food preparation we'll come to that shortly but the other point you brought up maybe this is

603
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,200
to foster a sense of community but this comes back to the question around there before why should

604
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:03,680
people in a communal sense feel better why should we all feel better when we do rituals and our

605
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,920
rituals of counting the stairs and making sure the application really went down the mailbox

606
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,280
why do we feel even better when we do it in the context of the community you're absolutely right

607
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:19,760
that these are meant to foster the group shared features of religiosity and spirituality the

608
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,960
question then becomes why does it work why do we respond to it why do we need shamans and

609
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:31,200
why do we respond to this ability to share these customs why is it the trait of 18 year olds all

610
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,480
over the world to try to invent a whole bunch of generationally shared rituals that lets the world

611
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,200
know i have nothing whatsoever to do with those appalling people who embarrass me my parents

612
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:47,680
what's that whole separation that goes in why is it that individuation is very often going hand in

613
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:53,440
hand with i need a community to do this individuation with that in a sense is the question and that

614
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:59,360
kind of brings us to this next issue looking at sort of a next scale of this application of this

615
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:05,760
ritualism by far one of the weirdest stories that france kafka ever wrote was the hunger artist

616
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:12,800
and this is a story about a person who performs starving his performance is he comes into a town

617
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:18,240
and he's locked up in a cage in the middle of town and he entertains he performs people performs there

618
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:23,760
by starving himself and people come and watch him starve and initially you read this and this

619
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,960
sounds like one of the more bizarre parables that kafka has come up with until you read that during

620
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:34,720
the middle ages there were hunger artists there were people who performed in european cities

621
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:41,280
starving themselves in a ritualistic way for people to come and watch suddenly we now look at a next

622
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:48,240
level the notion of performing rituals and people who are very good at it once again what are religious

623
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:54,480
leaders about mostly these days we think of them in terms of people who are empathic people who are

624
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:00,000
able to use the religious tradition they come from to make people treat each other better to

625
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,640
comfort people during troubled times but back to that issue that some of the time what a religious

626
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:10,160
leader is about is someone who is excellent at doing rituals and when you look at the history

627
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:16,640
of religion not only do you have the capacity for somebody to suddenly lose themselves to finally

628
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,480
have the same life destroying rituals being sanctioned and protected you have people who

629
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:28,800
could make a living performing the rituals you can have people who are aptly rewarded for doing so

630
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:34,800
some examples starting off with traditional hinduism there is a mantra there called the

631
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:40,080
gayatri mantra which i'm sure i'm mispronouncing but in traditional brahmanism you are supposed

632
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:45,920
to say this mantra two million four hundred thousand times in a lifetime to guarantee a good

633
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,280
afterlife and what happens is you have these aging captains of industry who were worried that may

634
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,440
not have quite gotten the right number in there and are feeling the years catching up with them

635
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,200
and what do you do you hire yourself a bunch of brahmins to come and say the prayer two million

636
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,160
four hundred thousand times for you and you say it in appropriate multiples there are set rules

637
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:13,680
you hire two hundred forty of them so each of them says ten thousand hundred thousand a thousand

638
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,000
ten thousand each of them says a whole lot of them and they all say the same number and there

639
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:22,560
are rules for what sort of tent city you put up for them in your backyard and what sort of feast

640
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:29,040
you throw for them you hire people to come and do the rituals for you that get you your afterlife

641
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:35,920
switching over to judaism these rules of orthodox food preparation there is an entire job you can get

642
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:41,920
built around ritualistic preparation of food now there is a certain primary level of this

643
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:47,120
which is people who make a living making sure food is prepared in a kosher way that they slaughter

644
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:52,160
animals things of that sort but there's a whole second level people who make a living watching

645
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:57,600
the folks who prepare the food you have rabbis who make a living sitting around and slaughter

646
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:02,640
houses and making sure the animals are slaughtered in a ritualistically appropriate way these guys

647
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,840
don't do anything with their own hands their entire job is to watch and make sure the rituals

648
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:13,520
are done right so that you can produce like fat free tofu hot dogs that would bring a smile to the

649
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:18,880
lips of the patriarchs it's done so ritualistically correctly these guys make a living doing this

650
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,680
and then the version probably we are most familiar with the american experience you have the high

651
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:29,840
school graduation you have the opening of the new town whatever and what happens the local clergyman

652
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:36,960
comes out and does a convocation says a prayer is invited to come and do a ritual to mark this

653
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,160
community transition and our response here is well yeah of course that's the guy's job and that's

654
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:48,320
exactly the point you could make a living doing these rituals and you can do that job these days

655
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:54,640
complete with health insurance and a retirement package and a 401k and all of that you make a

656
00:58:54,640 --> 00:59:00,400
living doing rituals and when you look at the history of religion suddenly what you see is an

657
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,280
inevitable outcome of that if there's somebody who's spending all his time washing his hands

658
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,840
ritualistically for the good of the community there's some peasant out there who's got to work

659
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:15,280
by the sweat of his brow to make bread for two people instead of one and there's an amazing novel

660
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,840
a science fiction novel and absolutely caught this which struck me as like one of the truly

661
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:25,600
horrible novels in terms of writing style almost as bad as asimov but in there was this brilliant

662
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:31,760
idea a book called zenicide by a writer named orson scott card and had this brilliant idea that

663
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:38,000
absolutely caught this and this was on as always a multi-planetary empire and the people running

664
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,840
the evil empire figured out the people on some planet were biologically very very prone towards

665
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:49,120
being extremely smart we could dissect that in lots of ways perhaps the particular prenatal

666
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,920
environment on that planet but they nonetheless worried that this planet had great danger for

667
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,800
producing revolutionaries that were going to leave the overthrow of the empire so what they did

668
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:05,840
was invent a virus a virus which caused obsessive compulsive disorder and they infected a subset

669
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:10,800
of people on this planet with the virus and the virus integrated into the dna so it would be passed

670
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:17,040
on multi-generationally and suddenly you had a subset of people who were paralyzed with ocd with

671
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:22,560
counting rituals and all of that and what did they manage to foist off on the rest of the population

672
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:28,160
these were religious experiences they were having and within a few generations this had become a

673
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,280
priestly class who sat around all day carrying out their obsessive rituals and the rest of the

674
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:38,240
population couldn't begin to think of revolting against the empire because they were spending all

675
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:43,120
day long having to come up with enough food to feed the priestly class and what you suddenly had

676
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:50,000
was a paralysis built around an entire class that does nothing other than carry out these rituals

677
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,600
and that planet was no worry to the rest of the empire at that point what you wind up seeing is

678
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:02,640
that truly involved ritualistic religious belief is often at the cost of doing anything else

679
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:09,360
there's a spectacular example of this historically and this is a 16th century augustinian monk in

680
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:14,640
germany named luder and this guy happened to have left a lot of written records and this guy is a

681
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:21,760
classic example of this he was the son the only son of a very aggressive very violent father there

682
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,880
was some suggestion that the father had in fact killed somebody once and abroad the son was absolutely

683
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:33,840
terrified of him and was extremely obedient to him very anxious very psychosomatic young man

684
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:39,360
one day he is out for a walk it's caught in a lightning storm out in an open field has a panic

685
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:44,800
attack there because the lightning storm makes a devotional agreement at that point if he can

686
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:50,480
survive this lightning storm he will become a monk he promises god that he survives he becomes a

687
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:56,640
monk and he is absolutely paralyzed with his ritualistic training he leaves records about

688
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:02,560
when he had his first mass he fainted beforehand he was so nervous about doing it wrong the mass

689
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:07,360
went on three times the length that was supposed to because he kept having to stop and start over

690
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:12,560
again because he was sure he had done something wrong he spent approximately five hours a day

691
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:18,960
in confession with his priestly mentor there his sort of advisor there confessing to every this is

692
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,120
a guy who lived in a monastery he didn't have a chance to do anything sinful but he'd be in there

693
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:28,480
five hours a day when i said this prayer i wasn't mindful enough about it i did it by rote when i

694
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,200
did this i wasn't thinking enough about this i pretty sure i didn't wash my hands enough

695
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:38,240
before doing this prayer i did this wrong god is angry at me for doing this i'm sure god is angry

696
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:44,640
at me for doing this and records his mentor this elderly priest eventually in exasperation

697
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:50,400
said one of the most astonishingly modern psychoanalytically insightful things imaginable

698
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:57,840
he said enough already god isn't angry with you for some reason you are very angry with god

699
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:03,360
god doesn't care about how many times you're washing your hands and the most definitive thing

700
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:08,880
about this young man this young priest was something he left in his records he washed

701
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:14,640
hours and hours a day an exact quote from him the more i wash the dirtier i get

702
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:22,320
and this is ocd and why do we know so much about this man because we know him 500 years later

703
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:27,840
not by his latin name of luder we know him by his more westernized name of martin luther

704
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:33,840
this was martin luther the founder of protestantism and these were the transitional events in his life

705
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:39,600
and talk about somebody who takes his personal affliction and turns it into perhaps the most

706
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:45,440
influential event of the last thousand years in western european history this is someone who turned

707
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:51,600
it into the biggest display of failing to obey his father that anybody has seen in the history of

708
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:58,800
catholicism and this was a person paralyzed by obsessive compulsive disorder so what we get here

709
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:05,280
at this point is the obvious question who invented knocking on wood for good luck who's the hindu who

710
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:10,800
had some sort of obsession with the number 24 or the jew with an obsession with the number 18

711
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:16,160
who got this belief that god was completely obsessed with the numbers of bones in the body and that's

712
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:22,240
how many things you should do well we have here is not only the recognition that if you are ocd

713
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:28,720
religion can provide a sanctuary if you are ocd in the right setting you can in fact make a living

714
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:35,360
by being religiously ritualistic but the recognition that probably people with strong obsessive compulsive

715
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:41,760
tendencies had something to do with the invention of many of these rituals i suspect historically

716
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,960
that's where it has come from so that brings up the issue that was brought up before why should

717
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:53,440
these rituals be so similar you look at the prohibitions for example in judaism more than 200

718
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,640
of these have to do with food preparation and cleansing you see the sequence in any of these

719
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:06,000
and the top four in ocd are identical to the top four in all of these religions cleansing of the body

720
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:13,840
food preparation entering and leaving significant religious places and numerology numbers why should

721
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:20,480
that be basically two types of explanations one is we may be seeing some sort of convergence

722
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:25,280
it's not by chance that people are highly ritualistically concerned with making sure their

723
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,560
bodies are clean and that their food is correctly prepared and i suspect that has part to do with

724
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:35,760
it but i suspect what we're also seeing and with records of people like martin luther what we're

725
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:41,280
also seeing is because some of the people who invented some of these religious rituals had a

726
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:48,000
background of ocd maybe not fully paralytic versions but nonetheless somebody spending five

727
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,800
hours a day washing his hands and five hours a day confessing about how he didn't wash his hands

728
01:05:52,800 --> 01:06:00,160
enough this does not seem to be a mild version the more i wash the dirtier i get okay what i think

729
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:07,440
you wind up seeing is that historically all sorts of folks generating rituals ocd is estimated to

730
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,720
have an incidence anywhere from one to ten percent in the population depending on how you define it

731
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:20,080
the continuum and what you have is i suspect in periods of religious crisis cultural crisis

732
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:26,000
during a period of persecution during the period where whatever is currently in shape is not working

733
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,040
the right person at the right moment comes forward and in effect says this is how i have

734
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:36,880
been privately honoring our lord all these years and i am offering it to all of you to see

735
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:42,000
this is what i have been doing and in the right place and time it catches on and it turns into

736
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:48,240
the thing that is the ritual for the rest of the community within decades okay so what i've been

737
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:54,000
suggesting here and what i also emphasize is none of this is original with me except for the notion

738
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,520
that the ocd has something to do with the invention of these rituals these ideas go back decades go

739
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:05,280
back centuries that there is a parallelism between the symptoms of what we call schizotypillism

740
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:11,360
and the metamagical backbone of religious theology there is a parallelism between what we call

741
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:18,160
obsessive compulsive disorder and the ritualism of mainstream orthodox religion and this key point

742
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:25,280
that the exact same behaviors which in one context destroys your life has you peripheralized do it

743
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:30,320
right do it in the right context and it is not peripheralizing it makes you very honored and

744
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:44,640
powerful there are more themes yeah wonderful question would you expect to see different

745
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:51,520
incidences of ocd type traits in different cultures depending on how secular the society is how

746
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:57,280
ritualistic the religion is you look at for example catholicism or high episcopalianism

747
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:02,640
highly ritualistic compared to lutherans or unitarians or quakers at the other end would

748
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:07,760
you expect to see different different incidences absolutely i don't know if anybody's studying

749
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:12,960
that that would be exactly a prediction you would expect okay a related one which taps

750
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:18,160
into the lecture on friday would you expect to see differences in the incidence of depression

751
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:24,400
depending on religiosity and boring do you see that with a vengeance one of the healthiest things

752
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:30,320
you could do with your life is to be religious and to be highly religious it is a very strong

753
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:36,400
protector against major depression religious belief extends your life expectancy and that's

754
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:42,240
after you control for it changes risk factors you're less likely to drink to excess all of that

755
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:48,480
what is the big issue in that field is do the health benefits of religiosity merely come from

756
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:53,040
the social community that you get typically by being religious the question early in the

757
01:08:53,040 --> 01:09:00,080
lecture today religiosity versus spirituality that might be a realm to dissociate them spirituality

758
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:05,040
if it's a very personal one you wouldn't get the community do you still get the health benefits

759
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:10,400
nobody knows at this point but those are studies that people are doing but absolutely one of the

760
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:15,680
greatest things you can do out there to buffer yourself from depression is to be religiously

761
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:21,360
believing and walk through all the steps at the end of the lecture the other day elements of control

762
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:27,920
predictability explanation outlet and you will see exactly how religion taps into that okay couple

763
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:34,880
more threads here in terms of making sense of some of the covariance between biological phenomenon

764
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,600
behavior that we can explain and patterns of religious belief back to something we talked

765
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:46,160
about earlier in the course take a hungry pigeon and put it in a cage and instead of the behaviorist

766
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:52,480
circumstance where it has to press a lever umpteen times to get food you randomly reward it and what

767
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:59,280
we discussed there was a pigeon has a strong psychic need to come up with an attribution

768
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:05,840
what did i do to cause this food to appear and what we went through was the fact that if a pigeon

769
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:11,440
is hungry enough and the reward is both big enough and random enough the pigeon has a prepared learning

770
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:18,640
state to make it think ah whatever i just did is what caused that to occur and then you suddenly

771
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:24,240
have superstitious conditioning the capacity to get pigeons doing the most outlandishly

772
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:29,600
ritualistic things over and over and over in the belief that that's the cause of the food appearing

773
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:35,360
and what we heard was take a room full of hungry pigeons and randomly reward all of them with food

774
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:40,000
at different points and come back a few days later and every pigeon is going to be having its own

775
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:46,960
private belief system built around in order to get food i have to do x the enforcement of superstitious

776
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:52,560
belief and that is the term that is used in psychology and as we often have here is a question

777
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:58,400
of is this word a metaphor is this word an inappropriate metaphor or what is superstitious

778
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:04,720
belief and to go back to the question that came up here before why do we have a societal need for

779
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:09,760
shamans why do we have a societal need for much of this because we are trying to explain the

780
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:15,520
unexplainable we are trying to look for causal links of things that may or may not be associated

781
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:22,320
this is basically a way of describing superstition how tight of a link do you need between cause and

782
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:27,760
effect to believe that there has been cause and effect and this is coming down to statistical

783
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:33,520
relations and if you allow yourself to believe that this prayer could be answered but it wasn't

784
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:38,640
this time because i wasn't concentrating enough i need to do it a bit more fervently all of that

785
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:45,440
you have a system that allows us very readily to see causal links that may not be there now what is

786
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:51,440
the next interesting neurobiological piece of this is that take animals take rats and damage their

787
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:58,640
hippocampus and what you get with hippocampal damage then is you have more trouble making causal

788
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:04,160
sequential links and events what you wind up seeing and this next sentence is meant to be

789
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:10,640
as provocative as it will sound is when you have rats with hippocampal damage they are more vulnerable

790
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:18,960
to superstitious conditioning essentially what that is saying is that as you have a damaged

791
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:25,280
hippocampus you have less of a capacity to tell the difference between accurate cause and effect

792
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:31,760
linkages and ones that are merely statistically hinting of that or ones that may not be in the

793
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:37,360
slightest that connected with each other hippocampal damage and rats have a lower threshold for

794
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:42,560
superstitious conditioning and we can very readily run with that one in terms of what the

795
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:48,480
implications of that might be going on our usual sequence from in order to appreciate a biological

796
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:54,800
effect big gross lesion sort of stuff to once again the much more subtle realm we all differ

797
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,560
in our number of hippocampal neurons in the amount of this enzyme in the amount of myelin and all

798
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:07,280
the biology we know all the individual differences a last disorder that winds up being interesting

799
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:13,680
there is a type of epilepsy which when you have it something happens to your religious belief system

800
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:18,480
and this is one of its characteristic features epileptic seizures as I think we've discussed

801
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:23,600
in here have characteristics as to what part of the brain they originate in and this is

802
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:28,960
epilepsy that originates in the temporal lobe the temporal lobe containing the hippocampus the

803
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:36,000
amygdala it's a big limbic area the temporal lobe temporal lobe epilepsy and about 30 years ago

804
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,640
a neurologist named Geshwin who was at Harvard he was probably the most influential neurologist of

805
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:46,480
the 20th century and Geshwin published a paper first describing what is now called temporal

806
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:53,120
lobe personality which is a cluster of personality traits that become far more common in people

807
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:58,800
with temporal lobe epilepsy once again not everybody with this personality profile has

808
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:04,320
epilepsy lurking there not everybody with temporal lobe epilepsy gets this profile but

809
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:09,200
statistically at a higher than expected rate what do you see with temporal lobe personality

810
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:16,640
first off the person becomes extremely serious and humorless okay you might say I would become

811
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:21,600
extremely serious and humorless if I suddenly came down with epilepsy what's the appropriate control

812
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:28,160
looking at other types of epilepsies of equivalent severity it's specific to temporal lobe so you

813
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:34,480
get the seriousness next thing you get is what is termed neophobia you don't like new things you

814
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:40,080
like to just do very familiar sorts of stuff the same small circle of friends the same very

815
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,160
relatively limited range of experiences okay if I had epilepsy I would suddenly get a lot more

816
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:52,080
sort of involuted in my lifestyle once again the controls or other types of epilepsies next thing

817
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:59,360
you see is this bizarre trait called hypergraphia which is people with temporal lobe personality

818
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:08,320
begin to write obsessively they feel a pressured need to write fourth trait and the most interesting

819
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:13,840
one of all is people with temporal lobe personality become obsessively interested

820
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:20,720
in religious and philosophical subjects and these are not people with uncontrolled seizures

821
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:25,600
happening all the time these are people whose seizures are relatively well controlled with

822
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:30,400
medication and once again well if I had this horrible neurological disease I'd suddenly

823
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:35,280
start getting more introspective but once again control for with the other types of epilepsy

824
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:40,800
and the classic temporal lobe patient that you see is somebody who is meeting a new neurologist

825
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:45,280
and says oh hi great to meet you you know I very strongly believe that a patient should be more

826
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:50,800
than just their symptoms so I've prepared this 60 page document here which is my philosophy about

827
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,600
life and meaning and at the next week's appointment comes back with a 40 page addendum this is what

828
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:01,440
you wind up seeing and there's this fabulous story told showing that it's not that you get religious

829
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:06,800
you get interested in religious and philosophical subjects this great story showing this and this

830
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:12,640
was apparently shortly after Geshwin first published this paper and he had some neurology

831
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:17,600
resident who one day all the residents were in there and the neurology resident was summarizing

832
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:22,480
some patient this was some 13 year old boy in there with temporal lobe epilepsy and he went through

833
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:27,200
the meds and all of that and how the kid was doing and at the end said oh by the way I just read your

834
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:32,160
paper on that personality stuff this kid doesn't fit at all doesn't fit in the slightest clearly doing

835
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:36,800
some chest thumping kind of territorial stuff with the big man there and Geshwin says oh yeah

836
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,760
really how come and he said because I asked him if he's religious he said no he's not Geshwin says

837
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,240
idiot out of my way he pushes him and goes stormy down the hall and the residents running after him

838
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,560
bursts into this kid's room and says oh hi I'm Dr. Geshwin and puts him through a neurological

839
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,320
exam and all of that and goes through and asked him does he like baseball has the weather all of

840
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:58,720
that and then offhandedly says well by the way are you religious and the boy says no I'm not and

841
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:04,560
then Geshwin asks the critical question he says oh how come and this 13 year old kid gives this

842
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:09,680
hour-long lecture about the internal inconsistencies of Christ's Sermon on the mountain the epic of

843
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:15,200
Gilgamesh and sort of Ancadi's treatment of this and Bertrand Russell's critique of Christ

844
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:20,000
and like Geshwin just leaves the residents in their torture to listen to this kid for an hour

845
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,280
and it's not becoming religious it's becoming fascinated with the subject and there's even

846
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:31,200
been a paper published in a neurology journal doing the sort of paleo forensic neurology

847
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:37,440
by neurologist speculating someone who in history had temporal lobe epilepsy and this was Saint Paul

848
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:43,200
Saint Paul who had seizure auras as documented no evidence that the guy was particularly humorous

849
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:48,960
the guy was hyper graphic as hell and clearly had a very strong interest in religious and

850
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:54,560
philosophical subjects and you know this is fun but what do you make of the fact that somebody

851
01:17:54,640 --> 01:18:00,400
has an uncontrolled seizure in this part of the brain for 30 seconds once every six months

852
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:05,200
and they become more interested in religious subjects and at the end of the handout I cite

853
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:11,040
a novel that was published a couple years ago called lying awake fabulous novel by Mark Salisman

854
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:18,080
talking about a nun who is in the middle of a rather dispiriting life experience as a nun it

855
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:23,840
has not been what she was hoping for it has mostly been empty ritual and in the last few years

856
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:29,360
she's been having religious visions and this is the most exciting thing that has ever happened to her

857
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:34,720
what she also has to admit is she has kind of become a star of her convent after being this

858
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:40,720
very peripheral nobody and they're publishing books about her visions and people are coming to see her

859
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:45,760
and what becomes apparent halfway through the book is that she has a tumor in her temporal lobe which

860
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:51,600
is causing temporal lobe seizures and suddenly what does it mean that this is what these visions

861
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:56,800
have been about what does it mean that this is something that somebody in a white coat would call

862
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:02,880
a disease is this a disease and do I want my disease cured do I want this taken away from me

863
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:09,040
and it's extraordinary novel absolutely getting these features of temporal lobe personality and

864
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:14,240
getting at this issue which now is the core of what this whole lecture has been what do we do with

865
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:20,240
something like this what do we do with the possibility that have an uncontrolled burst of

866
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:26,320
action potentials in one part of your brain for 30 seconds every six months and in a somewhat

867
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:32,640
deterministic way that makes you more interested in religious subjects now summarizing here what I

868
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:37,760
think is really important for me to emphasize is what I'm not saying because that I've kind of

869
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:42,240
learned the hard way over the years I'm touching on the subject in this class what things I am not

870
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:49,680
saying I am not saying ooh some snotty you got to be crazy to be religious that's nonsense nor am I

871
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:56,400
saying even that most people who are are psychiatrically suspect I'm not saying that in the slightest

872
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:04,080
what I'm saying is it is absolutely fascinating that the same exact traits which in a secular context

873
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:11,520
are life destroying separate you from the community and in the right setting are at the very core of

874
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:18,080
what is protected what is sanctioned what is rewarded what is valued in religious settings so often

875
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:23,600
and that there could be an underlying biology to this and what do we do with this what's most

876
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:29,040
interesting here is even if this describes one single person I mean to put cards on the table

877
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:34,400
I was raised in an extremely religious orthodox upbringing and I had a complete break with it

878
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:40,400
when I was about 14 and that process of completely breaking to the point now where I have no religion

879
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:46,320
I have no spirituality I'm utterly atheist and in passing it is probably the thing I most regret in

880
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:51,600
my life but it's something I appear not to be able to change the process of getting to that point

881
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:57,520
I view in retrospect as one of the most defining things in my life the process of turning into

882
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:04,160
that person from who I was what are we to make of the possibility that each one of us goes through

883
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:09,760
some equivalent version in our life deciding how religious or irreligious we are going to be

884
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:15,120
for a lot of us that are among the most defining features of who we are where we have wound up

885
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:20,560
with this and how we got there what do we make of the fact that even if there's one case in all

886
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:27,120
of human history of someone who got to wherever they were instead because of a neurotransmitter

887
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:33,120
hiccup because of a genetic influence because of something that we would see as deterministic as

888
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:38,800
your visions are due to a tumor in your temporal lobe what are we to do with this what I am also

889
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:44,960
saying here is it is just as interesting to ask this question about why some of us lose faith

890
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:50,560
as to ask this about why some of us gain faith it is just as biological it is simply much less

891
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:56,000
studied because there are fewer examples of it to study out there but it is just as biological of

892
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:01,600
the process and it is just as interesting if it has only been one person in all of history

893
