00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
This will be a lecture looking at a whole lot of the themes we've been

00:03.760 --> 00:08.400
considering all quarter in here, how they apply to a topic that is very close to

00:08.400 --> 00:13.040
home. And what I already know from some of the emails today was Friday's

00:13.040 --> 00:16.740
lecture, looking at depression, was already getting close to home. Some of the

00:16.740 --> 00:20.920
themes that came out at the end of the chaos lecture, some of the notions

00:20.920 --> 00:25.720
there that some of the stuff teaching us, perhaps there are no blueprints,

00:25.720 --> 00:29.640
perhaps there need not be blueprints, perhaps there may still be blueprints

00:29.680 --> 00:33.360
despite a theoretical demonstration that you don't need them hitting close to

00:33.360 --> 00:37.520
home also, that is what all of today's lecture is about, looking at some

00:37.520 --> 00:43.480
biological underpinnings of religiosity. And this one is far and away from the

00:43.480 --> 00:48.560
lecture I am most nervous for, simply because this one people wind up having

00:48.560 --> 00:53.040
strong opinions about, and I want to navigate through this one as successfully

00:53.040 --> 00:56.200
as possible. Okay, just to give me a sense of where I'm starting off from here,

00:56.280 --> 01:01.880
how many of you would characterize yourself as religious, as fairly

01:01.880 --> 01:08.560
religious, as highly religious? Okay, good. How many of you would characterize

01:08.560 --> 01:13.960
yourself as very, very comfortably, exceptingly non-religious? Lots of

01:13.960 --> 01:18.200
hands there as well. Okay, lots of potential differences in responding to

01:18.200 --> 01:22.360
this. Where we pick up on is from where we left off with a lecture last

01:22.360 --> 01:26.360
Wednesday, which was the schizophrenia lecture. And where we finished with was

01:26.360 --> 01:29.680
this whole notion that by now we have to have dealt with every single one of

01:29.680 --> 01:33.120
these topics, starting on the far right, what's the behavior look like, and

01:33.120 --> 01:37.400
eventually getting to the far left, what are the evolutionary roots? And what has

01:37.400 --> 01:41.160
always been the rationale for that is the second we're looking at anything with

01:41.160 --> 01:46.440
genes, genetic influences, genetic hints, genetic whatever, we're asking where

01:46.440 --> 01:50.360
these genes come from, where's the evolutionary sense, where's the adaptive

01:50.400 --> 01:54.280
value for anything we're looking at? How would a sociobiologist interpret it

01:54.280 --> 01:55.480
to someone else? Yeah, question?

02:01.800 --> 02:06.600
I should be, and I don't think I understand the subject enough to know. Other

02:06.600 --> 02:10.480
than something about religiosity is done in a social context, and that's going

02:10.480 --> 02:15.520
to become important here. And the difference is one that puzzles me a

02:15.520 --> 02:19.000
great deal, because it clearly transcends issues of just the social

02:19.000 --> 02:24.120
community, but that seems to be a good defining point to start from. Okay, so

02:24.120 --> 02:27.480
where we ended up there with was this puzzle. We finished at the end of

02:27.480 --> 02:31.600
depression looking at evolutionary aspects and looking at there may be some

02:31.600 --> 02:35.600
hidden benefits, that weird argument in one of the readings in your reader

02:35.600 --> 02:40.040
creativity and aspects of manic depression going hand in hand, but we were

02:40.040 --> 02:43.720
left with somewhat of a puzzle at the end of the schizophrenia lecture. Why

02:43.720 --> 02:47.040
might there have been selection for these genes? Because once again, we start

02:47.080 --> 02:51.080
off with a theme from the very beginning. Ooh, genes being selected for. Why

02:51.080 --> 02:55.200
did the giraffe have long necks? Because this is a trait that's adaptive. In our

02:55.200 --> 03:00.040
Darwinian terms, this is a trait that's associated with leaving more copies of

03:00.040 --> 03:04.800
your genes. In future generations, what is the adaptive value for genes for

03:04.800 --> 03:08.520
schizophrenia? Because we looked at the fact that in this contemporary form,

03:08.520 --> 03:13.760
schizophrenia is by definition a maladaptive trait. Schizophrenics leave

03:13.760 --> 03:18.120
fewer copies of their genes than their unaffected siblings. It is a trait which

03:18.120 --> 03:23.000
is formally maladaptive. What might be a hidden advantage lurking there? And

03:23.000 --> 03:27.160
where we left at the very end of that was just a hint that, in fact, as far as

03:27.160 --> 03:31.080
anyone can tell, there are no hidden advantages to schizophrenia. There may

03:31.080 --> 03:35.560
not be any adaptive advantage. What I left you with there was the notion,

03:35.560 --> 03:39.840
however, that there might be another disease lurking around related to

03:39.880 --> 03:44.680
schizophrenia, which does have an adaptive advantage. And to begin here, what we

03:44.680 --> 03:49.200
have to go back to is one of the basic ninth grade biology concepts in science

03:49.200 --> 03:53.360
there, which is the whole notion that, some of the time, a genetic trait, which

03:53.360 --> 03:58.320
is god-awful in one setting, may have some advantages elsewhere. And we all

03:58.320 --> 04:02.400
learned the exact same example back in ninth grade, sickle cell anemia. Sickle

04:02.400 --> 04:06.480
cell anemia, which in one context, when fully expressed, is a hematological

04:06.480 --> 04:11.600
disaster. Absolutely bad news, horrible. And in other settings, can protect you

04:11.600 --> 04:15.600
against malaria and not by chance that versions of sickle cell anemia have

04:15.600 --> 04:20.680
evolved in sub-Saharan Africa, Mediterranean areas, Thalassemia related

04:20.680 --> 04:25.160
diseases, that this has been a frequent solution. Also in passing, showing us one

04:25.160 --> 04:29.200
of the truisms from this class, there's no such thing as a bad gene. There's only

04:29.200 --> 04:34.280
a bad gene environment interaction. Okay, so this theme in medical genetics comes

04:34.320 --> 04:39.360
through a lot of times. Genetic traits, which in one setting are bad news, may

04:39.360 --> 04:43.560
have advantages in another setting. And it's turning out, this is a theme in

04:43.560 --> 04:48.880
lots of different realms of genetics. Other examples, Tay-Sachs disease. Tay-Sachs,

04:48.880 --> 04:53.200
horrible congenital disorder, predominantly found in Ashkenazi Jews. What you

04:53.200 --> 04:57.640
wind up getting there is full-blown version, complete cortical failure to

04:57.640 --> 05:02.720
develop. A child is massively retarded and birth dies shortly afterward. Partial

05:02.720 --> 05:07.320
version of Tay-Sachs disease and you're resistant to tuberculosis. Nobody knows

05:07.320 --> 05:11.200
the mechanism for it yet. People absolutely understand why the sickle cell

05:11.200 --> 05:15.880
trait both sets you up for an anemia and protection from malaria. Nobody

05:15.880 --> 05:20.160
understands it yet with Tay-Sachs, but this explains one of the phenomena back

05:20.160 --> 05:25.560
from the Middle Ages, the European belief that Jews were safe from tuberculosis

05:25.560 --> 05:29.720
because they were poisoning the Christian wells. And that was a cause of a large

05:29.720 --> 05:34.480
number of programs back when there is a genetic explanation, which is the trait

05:34.480 --> 05:38.520
for Tay-Sachs disease in this partially expressed form protects from

05:38.520 --> 05:44.120
tuberculosis. More examples of this. Cystic fibrosis, the most common congenital

05:44.120 --> 05:47.720
disorder these days, and that is massively life-threatening.

05:47.720 --> 05:51.720
A copy finished, so I would need a code to make a...

05:51.720 --> 05:57.720
A code. Anybody know a code?

05:58.720 --> 06:04.720
By Wednesday. Do you have no where the handout is?

06:04.720 --> 06:06.720
They're not Xerox.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.720
Are they sitting there though?

06:08.720 --> 06:13.320
Cystic fibrosis, full-blown version disastrous disease. What you get in

06:13.320 --> 06:19.120
cystic fibrosis is inflammatory disease. Your lungs fill up with fluid. You often

06:19.120 --> 06:24.280
are dead by age 20. Horrible disease. Partial version of cystic fibrosis and you

06:24.280 --> 06:28.600
are protected against cholera. And the exact same mechanism that causes an

06:28.600 --> 06:32.680
imbalance of fluids in the lungs is the same mechanism that keeps you from

06:32.680 --> 06:37.640
losing all your fluids when you have cholera of dehydrating, highly adaptive.

06:37.640 --> 06:43.160
A theme that keeps popping up over and over. Full-blown version, bad news, partial

06:43.160 --> 06:47.840
genetic version, good news. And what you wind up getting is this basic argument,

06:47.840 --> 06:51.800
a numerical argument, very similar to the, I'll lay down my life for two

06:51.800 --> 06:55.440
brothers or eight cousins deal, of if you've got enough people with the

06:55.440 --> 07:01.120
partial protective adaptive version, you can afford the occasional cousin with

07:01.120 --> 07:06.560
the full-blown version. The trait overall will still be passed on. Now what this

07:06.560 --> 07:10.120
sets us up for is thinking about whether something like this is going on with

07:10.120 --> 07:15.280
schizophrenia. And the question to ask of course is, what is a mild genetic version

07:15.280 --> 07:20.080
of schizophrenia? And this one got discovered in the 1970s. Back to that

07:20.080 --> 07:22.920
classic study we've heard about in a couple of different lectures by now,

07:22.920 --> 07:27.840
Kedi, that psychiatrist from Harvard, who with his colleagues went off to Denmark

07:27.840 --> 07:32.080
and spent a decade there looking at every single adoption case and looking at

07:32.080 --> 07:35.920
the patterns of schizophrenia, the schizophrenic, the adoptive parents, the

07:35.920 --> 07:40.400
biological parents. In the course of them doing this, they discovered something

07:40.400 --> 07:43.200
amazing. Because think about what these guys did. This was this team of

07:43.200 --> 07:48.560
psychiatrists who spent a decade in Denmark. What they did was interview every

07:48.560 --> 07:54.040
single family of every adoptee in Denmark. This was like 10,000 people. This

07:54.040 --> 07:58.680
was a massive amount of work looking for schizophrenics, looking in the various

07:58.680 --> 08:02.960
pedigrees, all that sort of thing, interviewing huge numbers of people,

08:02.960 --> 08:06.760
just a handful of these folks, so they would all get the diagnostic criteria

08:06.760 --> 08:11.360
fairly similar. Well-designed study, blah blah. What had they done by the end of a

08:11.360 --> 08:16.520
decade? They had talked to more family members of schizophrenics than any

08:16.520 --> 08:21.080
psychiatrists in history. And think about this. Your average psychiatrist who's

08:21.080 --> 08:25.560
got some schizophrenic patients will, you know, meet once every six months with

08:25.560 --> 08:29.720
the parent. If the schizophrenic is on the young side, maybe occasionally will

08:29.720 --> 08:34.320
also have sessions on a regular basis. These people had just interviewed tens of

08:34.320 --> 08:38.600
thousands of family members of schizophrenics. And they noticed something

08:38.600 --> 08:43.520
interesting. They noticed that on the average, there was something a little bit

08:43.520 --> 08:48.400
strange about family members of schizophrenics. Not all of them, and these

08:48.400 --> 08:52.880
traits are not only found amongst family members of schizophrenics, but at a

08:52.880 --> 08:57.760
higher than expected rate, there is a weird sort of quirky personality that

08:57.760 --> 09:02.720
went with family members of schizophrenics, biological family members. And this

09:02.720 --> 09:08.080
version of a much milder case of schizophrenia is now called schizotypal

09:08.080 --> 09:12.400
personality. This is a standardly recognized disorder in psychiatry,

09:12.640 --> 09:18.960
schizotypalism is a mild genetic version of schizophrenia. What does schizotypal

09:18.960 --> 09:25.120
look like? First off, people have somewhat loose associations, not remotely in the

09:25.120 --> 09:29.040
realm of a schizophrenic, and there are standardized scales that can be given to

09:29.040 --> 09:33.040
show this is someone out of the normal range, but not in the schizophrenic range

09:33.040 --> 09:38.480
in an intermediate range. In addition, you get a social withdrawal. And this is

09:38.480 --> 09:42.640
not the complete dysfunctional, unable to hold down a job locked up in the back

09:42.640 --> 09:46.080
of the village version of schizophrenia. This is someone instead who just

09:46.080 --> 09:51.840
gravitates towards fairly solitary occupations. This is the lighthouse keeper,

09:51.840 --> 09:57.120
this is the fire tower watcher, this is the classic schizotypal occupation,

09:57.120 --> 10:00.880
this is the person sitting alone in the projection room in the movie theater

10:00.880 --> 10:05.440
eight hours a night in the dark there, classic sort of schizotypal jobs,

10:05.440 --> 10:11.120
socially detached, very solitary. The most striking feature of schizotypals

10:11.120 --> 10:16.240
is what is termed metamagical thinking. And this is where things begin to get

10:16.240 --> 10:20.800
interesting. Metamagical thinking, this is not someone who is thought disordered,

10:20.800 --> 10:25.120
psychotic, unable to function, this is someone who just kind of believes in

10:25.120 --> 10:30.400
strange things. This is someone who's really, really into science fiction and fantasy.

10:31.040 --> 10:35.840
This is someone, okay, I see some of the concern popping up here. This is someone

10:35.840 --> 10:41.200
who's into some sort of new age stuff in a really frenzy sort of way. This is

10:41.200 --> 10:46.640
someone who believes in mental telepathy or UFOs. This is a first hint. This is

10:46.640 --> 10:51.200
someone who, if they have a religious structure of belief, has an extremely

10:51.200 --> 10:56.800
concrete level of interpretation. Remembering this seems to be quite similar

10:56.800 --> 11:01.280
to schizophrenia, what apples oranges have in common multi-syllabic words,

11:01.280 --> 11:05.200
that concreteness at the level of abstraction. These are people who tend

11:05.200 --> 11:11.200
towards extremely fundamentalist, concrete interpretations of religious events.

11:11.200 --> 11:15.520
Seven-day creation of the world, this is not a metaphor, this is not a parable,

11:15.520 --> 11:20.000
this could be measured down to the minute. People alive who were once dead,

11:20.000 --> 11:24.720
this is not a metaphor for keeping the spirit going. This is an exact description

11:24.800 --> 11:29.680
of the events we begin to see where we're heading here. What schizotypillism is

11:29.680 --> 11:35.040
about is it's a very mild version of schizophrenia in terms of the loose

11:35.040 --> 11:39.200
associations, in terms of the concreteness of associations, the social

11:39.200 --> 11:43.520
detachment, and most of all the metamagical thinking. This is now a

11:43.520 --> 11:48.880
standard diagnostic category in psychiatry to have a schizotypal personality.

11:49.600 --> 11:55.120
So, what we then ask is, where does this come from? What is this like? And what we

11:55.120 --> 11:58.400
have to ask is of course our usual question when trying to make sense of

11:58.400 --> 12:03.760
a human trait is recognizing 99% of human history was not spent with schizotypills

12:03.760 --> 12:08.080
being able to get jobs in film projection rooms. What does schizotypillism look

12:08.080 --> 12:13.200
like in traditional non-westernized human societies? And the answer to that

12:13.200 --> 12:18.640
turns out to have been floating around for 60, 70 years in the anthropology literature.

12:18.640 --> 12:22.960
And this is back to the 1930s. An anthropologist named Paul Raiden, who was

12:22.960 --> 12:26.560
the first one to point this out, was the first one of a whole tradition

12:26.560 --> 12:30.720
emphasizing what was a pretty strong area of research in the 1940s in

12:30.720 --> 12:34.480
anthropology. He was the first person who pointed out that in

12:34.480 --> 12:39.600
traditional human societies, there is a category of people there who count as,

12:39.600 --> 12:44.800
and these are his exact words, half crazy. Who are the half crazies in

12:44.800 --> 12:49.680
traditional human society? The shamans, the witch doctors, the

12:49.680 --> 12:53.120
medicine men, the medicine women. These are members of

12:53.120 --> 12:57.440
society who make a living being metamagical. And

12:57.440 --> 13:01.920
Raiden was the first one to emphasize this. In traditional human societies,

13:01.920 --> 13:06.960
the shamans are the ones who converse with the dead for ritualistic reasons. The

13:06.960 --> 13:11.200
shamans are the ones who speak in tongues. The shamans are the ones who

13:11.280 --> 13:15.520
at the full moon turn into the hyena to protect the village from predators.

13:15.520 --> 13:19.840
The shamans are the ones who are metamagical for a thing, for a living.

13:19.840 --> 13:23.200
And this has been a theme in anthropology for quite some time.

13:23.200 --> 13:27.040
One anthropologist named Akternek referred to

13:27.040 --> 13:31.840
shamans as being healed madmen. In the 1940s, anthropologists named

13:31.840 --> 13:35.200
Krober, who started the Anthra Department in Berkeley and was one of the

13:35.200 --> 13:38.560
grand old men in the field. This is a quote of his describing what

13:38.560 --> 13:42.480
shamanism is about. The shaman displays his possession by

13:42.480 --> 13:45.440
a spirit by publicly reenacting his specific

13:45.440 --> 13:49.360
personal experience, that of a man suffering from a particular mental

13:49.360 --> 13:52.720
affliction. His projections, his hallucinations,

13:52.720 --> 13:56.800
his journey through space and time thus became a dramatic ritual

13:56.800 --> 14:00.000
and served as the prototype for all future concepts

14:00.000 --> 14:04.800
of the religious road of perfection. And this was the recognition in the 30s and

14:04.800 --> 14:08.880
40s that what shamanism is about is a very controlled,

14:08.880 --> 14:14.000
very socially contextual version of metamagical schizotypillism.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.640
The word did not exist in the field at the time,

14:16.640 --> 14:21.120
but that is what it is. Now what Krober emphasized in his writing was

14:21.120 --> 14:25.040
these are not schizophrenics. And what we heard about in that story in

14:25.040 --> 14:28.800
class four days ago, looking at that schizophrenic

14:28.800 --> 14:32.400
person in that messiah village, is that people in traditional human

14:32.400 --> 14:35.280
societies are no more tolerant to the mentally ill

14:35.280 --> 14:39.040
than we are in the West and just as delighted to find cultural means

14:39.040 --> 14:42.960
to peripheralize them, these are not full-blown schizophrenics.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.400
These are not people who suddenly are speaking in tongues

14:46.400 --> 14:50.560
at the exact silent moment in the hunt. These are people who are speaking in

14:50.560 --> 14:54.400
tongues at the right time. These are people who are hearing voices

14:54.400 --> 14:58.080
at the right time and you remember what the punchline was of that story

14:58.080 --> 15:01.200
about that schizophrenic woman in that messiah village was

15:01.200 --> 15:06.080
she heard voices at the wrong time. Hearing voices at the right time

15:06.080 --> 15:10.000
is not schizophrenia, it is a version of schizotypillism.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.240
And what you see when you look at the human tradition of shamanism,

15:14.240 --> 15:18.080
these are not peripheralized people. These are some of the most powerful

15:18.080 --> 15:21.200
members of society. Many societies have a tradition

15:21.200 --> 15:25.440
of shamans being celibate, but many of them, most of them as it turns out,

15:25.440 --> 15:28.400
do not. And these are people who are anything but

15:28.400 --> 15:32.160
reproductively maladaptive. These are people who have been passing on their

15:32.160 --> 15:36.400
genes just fine throughout history. Shamanism, this mild

15:36.400 --> 15:39.360
version, this contextually appropriate version of

15:39.360 --> 15:43.520
metamagicalism has done wonderfully throughout human history.

15:43.520 --> 15:47.600
And a great example of that, the fact that you need to get it just right,

15:47.600 --> 15:51.760
was Krober sort of emphasizing this, that in the right setting,

15:51.760 --> 15:55.360
what would be an absolutely peripheralizing set of traits

15:55.360 --> 15:58.880
instead makes you a very powerful, very sanctioned,

15:58.880 --> 16:03.040
and that's the word that he used, a very sanctioned member of society,

16:03.040 --> 16:06.480
and it's not for nothing that the word sanction has a whole lot to do with the

16:06.480 --> 16:09.840
word sanctuary. This is a realm in which the exact same

16:09.840 --> 16:14.160
traits would spectacularly fail to work in other cultural settings,

16:14.160 --> 16:18.400
do it right, and it works just fine. And Krober had a wonderful anecdote about

16:18.400 --> 16:21.360
this, this sense of you got to get it just right.

16:21.360 --> 16:25.760
He apparently was at some ritual, a ceremony, he spent most of his time

16:25.760 --> 16:28.480
doing his anthropology with Native American groups,

16:28.480 --> 16:32.720
and this was some ceremony being done by the Winnebago's, and I was actually

16:32.720 --> 16:36.080
found it quite bizarre that there was a group called the Winnebago,

16:36.080 --> 16:39.040
but hanging out with the Winnebago's, and this was one of his

16:39.040 --> 16:43.040
informants there sort of explaining this ritual, and this was apparently some

16:43.040 --> 16:47.280
really fraughty, really quite over-the-top ritual that the Shaman was

16:47.280 --> 16:51.280
pulling off and was speaking in tongues and rolling on the fire, and all of that

16:51.360 --> 16:55.360
and this guy said, that is great, we've got this Shaman here, this guy is

16:55.360 --> 16:58.240
like the best, he's worth every dollar we pay him,

16:58.240 --> 17:01.840
this guy is terrific, we are so lucky to have a Shaman like this in our village,

17:01.840 --> 17:04.880
this guy is, thank god we don't have two of them though,

17:04.880 --> 17:10.560
two way too much, one's just fine, and you have this recognition that

17:10.560 --> 17:14.000
this is not schizophrenia, you wouldn't want a person to be

17:14.000 --> 17:17.920
schizophrenic because they will be as peripheralized as in our own society,

17:17.920 --> 17:20.800
you want to get it just right, you don't want to have too many of them,

17:20.800 --> 17:24.720
you've got to have some people who are some plain meat and potatoes, good hunters,

17:24.720 --> 17:27.760
that sort of thing, and you want the ratio of that to the Shamanistic

17:27.760 --> 17:32.400
metamagical folks to be quite high, but you need a few of them around,

17:32.400 --> 17:35.920
and what the anthropologists have been noting for 60 years is

17:35.920 --> 17:40.960
all human cultures traditionally have some very metamagical folks around,

17:40.960 --> 17:44.160
and these folks are anything but peripheralized with a decreased

17:44.160 --> 17:48.480
reproductive success, they're some of the most honored members of society.

17:48.480 --> 17:55.120
So what you wind up getting here is that classic partially expressed sort of continuum deal going on

17:55.120 --> 17:59.840
which is human societies throughout history have had such a need for shamans

17:59.840 --> 18:03.520
that they can put up with the occasional second cousin who's fully schizophrenic,

18:03.520 --> 18:07.280
as long as you've got the ratio right, and what the numbers suggest,

18:07.280 --> 18:11.120
the 1 to 2 percent rate of schizophrenia throughout human cultures

18:11.120 --> 18:14.480
and the number average population size of human villages

18:14.480 --> 18:19.200
and the number of shamans it works about right. Throughout history there has been more of a

18:19.200 --> 18:24.640
predominance of schizotypal shamans than of schizophrenics you can afford to put up with

18:24.640 --> 18:29.680
the occasional cousin. Now where does this wind up heading? What the main point of this section is

18:29.680 --> 18:34.960
about is this is not just about the people naked in the National Geographics with the bones on their

18:34.960 --> 18:40.880
noses, and this was a critical transition recognizing this. At some point a whole lot of people in

18:40.880 --> 18:47.280
that field were writing about the primitiveness of non-westernized religion, and there was a great

18:47.280 --> 18:52.560
quote who came up with this one, a guy named Devereux referred to primitive religion as being

18:52.560 --> 19:00.000
organized schizophrenia. This was somebody in the 1940s exactly getting this flavor of contextualized

19:00.000 --> 19:05.360
appropriate hearing the voices at the right time, all of that, but this was overwhelmingly literature

19:05.360 --> 19:10.080
about the weird stuff those folks are up to in the night and the time life specials on public

19:10.080 --> 19:16.240
television and what the critical transition is is it's not just about them. At some point this

19:16.240 --> 19:21.280
anthropologist Ackernick who was quite leftist in his orientation wrote a long essay saying how

19:21.280 --> 19:27.040
incredibly culturally chauvinistic it was of the western anthropologists to write all these articles

19:27.040 --> 19:33.760
about how shamans are half healed madmen and how condescending that was to talk about those cultures

19:33.760 --> 19:39.920
as being so irrationally based in contrast to us and what's the obvious punchline is the problem

19:39.920 --> 19:44.560
isn't saying that they're irrational when we're saying that we aren't but it's saying that we're

19:44.560 --> 19:49.600
equally irrational. We are equally irrational in some of the tenets that we have here. A quote

19:49.600 --> 19:55.600
from Ackernick at the time was our culture is unique and outlawing the irrational. Let me give

19:55.600 --> 20:02.880
you some recent statistics from a survey. What's the name of the survey? The main national survey

20:02.880 --> 20:09.920
of people. Who? Yes Gallipole that guy the Gallipole a recent Gallipole survey I don't know about you

20:09.920 --> 20:17.200
guys but these numbers astonished me 25 percent of Americans say they believe in ghosts 36 percent

20:17.200 --> 20:24.560
believe in mental telepathy 47 percent believe in UFOs and more than 50 percent of Americans believe

20:24.560 --> 20:31.120
in the devil and a belief that the devil influences daily activities these are people who can vote

20:31.120 --> 20:36.400
these are people who can serve on juries these are people who can operate motor vehicles these

20:36.400 --> 20:41.760
are people making decisions about medical interventions I for one in this outpost of not

20:41.760 --> 20:47.280
terribly extreme irrationality in this corner of the country I'm astonished we live in a world that

20:47.280 --> 20:53.760
is highly irrational and the punchline of this is this is not simply about non-western traditional

20:53.760 --> 20:59.920
human societies the exact same thread of schizotypillism runs throughout all of the belief systems

20:59.920 --> 21:06.400
of human societies including western ones we are permeated by irrationality now some of the versions

21:06.400 --> 21:11.760
of it that we have in the west are utter nonsense ones ones that have just been like invented out of

21:11.760 --> 21:17.920
thin air in recent years which is kind of like fast food for these sort of Nuvo sort of medieval

21:17.920 --> 21:22.960
peasants in their hot tubs up in Marin this is the world of crystals and channeling and things

21:22.960 --> 21:28.000
of that sort but some of the versions of our westernized irrationally go back millennia

21:28.080 --> 21:34.400
and organize some of our most cherished values the same irrationality and the same valuing

21:34.400 --> 21:40.240
of those who invent the appropriate versions of the irrationality runs throughout the west

21:40.240 --> 21:45.280
okay just to show you that I am not being overly hostile or will try to pull in my own sort of

21:45.280 --> 21:51.040
tradition that I was raised in is not normally considered a sign of robust mental health to

21:51.040 --> 21:56.960
hear voices coming out of burning bushes this is considered a worrisome sign this is considered

21:56.960 --> 22:02.320
diagnostic it is not a good thing to be reporting that you just spent the night wrestling an angel

22:02.320 --> 22:07.360
it is usually a very disturbing sign if you were reporting you've had a conversation with someone

22:07.360 --> 22:14.560
who is dead and has risen from the grave these are diagnosable problems in our secular western realm

22:14.560 --> 22:21.120
these are the backbones of our belief systems we in the west as well as we humans in non-westernized

22:21.120 --> 22:27.040
settings schizotypillism runs through all of human history what you wind up having then

22:27.040 --> 22:32.320
is this obvious question who invented this stuff who came up with the notion that the world was

22:32.320 --> 22:37.600
invented in seven days or snakes with apples are up to something no good or it's possible to give

22:37.600 --> 22:42.640
birth and you're still a virgin these were not designed by committees these were designed by

22:42.640 --> 22:48.400
extremely formative extremely influential schizotypals throughout history yes

22:51.520 --> 22:57.840
yep it's genetic evidence those same studies showed that it runs through the adoption studies

22:57.840 --> 23:02.800
showed it's a biological trait it runs through the biological side of the adoptive pedigrees

23:02.800 --> 23:09.680
it's a it's a genetic trait what the new studies are now being to show is mild tendency towards

23:09.680 --> 23:14.960
increased dopamine tone mild tendency towards most of the biology we heard about what we're

23:14.960 --> 23:22.000
seeing is totally artificial bucket to say schizophrenia up to here past the side non-schizophrenic

23:22.000 --> 23:26.720
we have this in-between zone like everything else we've been thinking about it's on a continuum

23:26.720 --> 23:31.520
and seems to be the same biology in a much milder form question somewhere there

23:36.080 --> 23:40.240
yep same sort of stuff okay so what do you wind up yeah question

23:45.920 --> 23:46.240
yep

23:55.520 --> 24:01.760
no because the the critical thing there is they will very readily tell you much as people will

24:01.760 --> 24:07.520
tell you here in their own schizotypal experiences that you need the right person to lead it they

24:07.520 --> 24:13.360
can't get that going without the right shaman starting it off you need them as a catalyst yeah

24:15.840 --> 24:25.920
okay why do we need this why do we value this okay we'll come to this probably in about two

24:25.920 --> 24:32.800
days but this is tapping into all of the you know why why do we search for some fairly

24:32.800 --> 24:37.680
unlikely answers to the big questions that plague all of us we'll come to this in two days but you

24:37.680 --> 24:42.560
know this is getting at the core of some of the basic questions here okay let me push on here

24:42.560 --> 24:48.160
what you wind up seeing with this is that this is on a continuum and who invented this stuff and

24:48.160 --> 24:54.000
you look throughout the history of religious leaders those who have invented some of the theology

24:54.000 --> 24:58.640
and we will come to different variants of religious leaders shortly as you see those who invented

24:58.640 --> 25:04.880
the theology that there is very often a thread of metamagical thinking that goes through this

25:04.880 --> 25:10.800
and this is metamagical thinking of a type that falls readily into the spectrum of schizotypalism

25:10.800 --> 25:16.640
now one of the themes we've endlessly come back to in this class is appropriate context appropriate

25:16.640 --> 25:22.480
context and this is a perfect realm to see this because what we wind up getting is you got to

25:22.480 --> 25:28.080
get it just right if you hear voices it's got to be during the ceremony if you're speaking in tongues

25:28.080 --> 25:32.320
it can't be in the middle of the silent part of the hunt you don't want to have too many of them

25:32.320 --> 25:37.520
thank god we've got this shaman but not two of them around here you've got to get the context right

25:37.520 --> 25:43.360
and what we've seen throughout human history and western history as well is get it wrong and we

25:43.360 --> 25:49.120
have names for these things get it wrong and these are abortive religious fringe groups these are

25:49.120 --> 25:54.160
cults and you look at some versions of this in our own recent time you look at david koresh and

25:54.160 --> 26:00.480
waco you look at someone like james jinn jones and jones town you look at someone like charles

26:00.480 --> 26:06.160
manson and these are people who were highly metamagical in their thinking highly charismatic

26:06.160 --> 26:11.520
but hit a wall at the point where we still classify them as cults manson is a diagnosed

26:11.520 --> 26:16.960
schizophrenic with the other two there's only post hoc sort of sort of forensic psychiatry

26:16.960 --> 26:22.960
that you can do what you wind up getting is get it wrong and we call it a cult get it right in the

26:22.960 --> 26:27.600
right time in the right place and maybe for the next couple of millennia people won't have to go

26:27.600 --> 26:34.000
to work on your birthday if you get it exactly right in that setting so what i think we see here is

26:34.080 --> 26:40.240
a setting here for making sense the exact same traits in a different context to use krober's

26:40.240 --> 26:46.560
words in a cultural context that is not sanctioned the exact same traits count as psychiatrically

26:46.560 --> 26:52.880
suspect these days what this is about is not only if you get it in the right context is it okay

26:52.880 --> 26:58.720
it is highly honored tapping into the question that came in before that all human societies have a

26:58.800 --> 27:05.280
strong need for a certain degree of these folks around you need to get the ratios right okay

27:05.280 --> 27:10.160
picking up on this theme a transition to a next point in the sense that this is talking about

27:10.160 --> 27:15.600
sort of the structural steel of religious belief what are the basic beliefs you have

27:15.600 --> 27:22.480
there is no god but one he is a la the you know whatever versions of the central formats you have

27:22.480 --> 27:27.920
there is a trinity i am who i am any of these variants these are sort of the building blocks the

27:27.920 --> 27:34.160
structural steel of religion but what religion is often often also about is lots of other things

27:34.160 --> 27:40.000
we have a very modern very westernized view of religion these days what religion is often about

27:40.000 --> 27:45.840
is the social community that it brings you what religion is often about is the motivation for

27:45.840 --> 27:52.240
good works throughout most of history what religion is about in one very orthodox variant is the

27:52.240 --> 27:58.480
carrying out of rituals the daily performance of ritualistic behaviors in the context of religion

27:58.480 --> 28:04.800
and this transitions us to the next subject in here and this whole notion of ritualism as a backbone

28:04.800 --> 28:10.560
of religion wonderful quote to that effect henry ward beecher father of harry and beecher stowe

28:10.560 --> 28:16.960
famous protestant preacher in new england i think the 1830s or so had this quote at the time religion

28:16.960 --> 28:22.720
is daily bread religion is not just cake on sunday the notion that what religion is about

28:22.720 --> 28:29.440
is the small acts god is in the detail religion is in the small acts of the daily rituals now

28:29.440 --> 28:35.360
beginning to look not at the large theological notions our religion believes there are multiple

28:35.360 --> 28:40.880
gods there are virgin births that god can speak through a burning bush but instead religion as

28:40.880 --> 28:46.720
the daily practices of ritual now what is interesting about this what comes through with this is

28:46.720 --> 28:53.440
another theme another subtype of a very mild version of a psychiatric disorder which once

28:53.440 --> 29:00.320
again works spectacularly when you get it just right not now with the metamagical big theology

29:00.320 --> 29:06.240
building blocks of religion but the daily bits and pieces of ritualism and this brings in another

29:06.240 --> 29:12.240
psychiatric disorder one we haven't talked about much in class so far okay i guarantee on a regular

29:12.240 --> 29:18.320
basis all of us in this room getting to some point where it's some anxious period you've got some

29:18.320 --> 29:22.160
major deadline you're applying for some summer something rather that you really want to get

29:22.160 --> 29:26.240
you're totally uptight about it you're sitting down and you're writing the essay and before you

29:26.240 --> 29:30.400
can write the essay you got to get your favorite pen it's got to be right there and you got to

29:30.400 --> 29:34.480
rearrange your desk and you got to get everything sorted out and finally you finish it and you go

29:34.480 --> 29:39.200
mail off the application you know you put in the mailbox and you check again to make sure it went

29:39.200 --> 29:43.440
down and this is really important you don't want to see it check again just to make sure and you're

29:43.440 --> 29:48.080
all set for that and you finally there's no one else around so you go and you look in front of it

29:48.080 --> 29:51.680
and looking back at that and that sort of thing i mean we all do this actually maybe we all do this

29:51.680 --> 29:57.680
and i'm embarrassing myself horribly but my bet is most of us do this sort of thing we fall into

29:57.680 --> 30:04.880
obsessive little rituals during times of anxiety we also have rituals intrusive thoughts that just

30:04.880 --> 30:10.480
invade our heads at times where they are of no obvious purpose they are at the cost of thinking

30:10.480 --> 30:16.000
anything more clearly it's totally maddening and you can't stop the thoughts for example today i'm

30:16.000 --> 30:22.000
working on a paper that's involving all sorts of very deep ruminative thought and figuring out all

30:22.000 --> 30:26.720
sorts of data stuff and i've made no progress on it at all this morning because for some reason

30:26.720 --> 30:31.520
that i don't understand at all all of today i've had the damn theme song from teletubbies going

30:32.480 --> 30:37.360
and i can't stop it especially the part where lala leaps up and says lala the really cute part

30:37.360 --> 30:43.040
there and i can't stop doing this and i don't know what's going on i did not plan to lose today's

30:43.040 --> 30:48.800
productivity because of teletubbies but we get this some stupid jingle that's stuck in your head

30:48.800 --> 30:54.080
you find yourself going up a flight of stairs and you can't stop yourself from counting the steps

30:54.080 --> 31:00.320
we do this we all do this and we tend to do it more often during periods of anxiety and the

31:00.320 --> 31:07.200
interpretation of that is that we impose this totally arbitrary useless destructive structure

31:07.200 --> 31:13.040
at a time when everything else feels like you're walking on quicksand we all do this as some sort

31:13.040 --> 31:19.280
of adaptation to periods of anxiety and what we transition into now is talking about a psychiatric

31:19.280 --> 31:25.680
disorder where people do this all the time and it not only gets in the way of them getting some work

31:25.680 --> 31:31.840
done on a project that requires some concentration this is a disorder that absolutely destroys their

31:31.840 --> 31:39.520
lives this is ocd obsessive compulsive disorder and the full blown version of it bears so little

31:39.520 --> 31:44.880
resemblance to what any of us do when we are having to get the pen right and checking the mailbox

31:44.880 --> 31:50.560
the third time and having the jingle go through your head for a while it is of such a scale larger

31:50.560 --> 31:56.000
it is so much more destructive it is virtually unimaginable from our perspective people with

31:56.000 --> 32:03.120
ocd have their lives completely destroyed by this disorder people with ocd in the full blown version

32:03.120 --> 32:09.040
spent six hours a day washing their hands the characteristic that's always at the top of the

32:09.040 --> 32:16.000
list with ocd is this obsessive focusing on hygiene is worried that you are constantly in some way

32:16.000 --> 32:22.480
soiled six hours a day of washing these are people who cannot hold down jobs their marriages come

32:22.480 --> 32:28.720
apart their relationships are destroyed because they cannot stop washing and you have in the reader

32:28.720 --> 32:35.360
one profile of somebody with ocd from a book entitled the boy who couldn't stop washing this is the

32:35.360 --> 32:42.000
symptom that always pops up at the top of the list and the actual washing process is ritualistic

32:42.000 --> 32:47.680
beyond belief these are people who have bought seven different kinds of antibacterial soap

32:47.680 --> 32:52.480
they go through this whole sequence the water has to be a certain temperature for the first level of

32:52.480 --> 32:58.160
washing then a certain type of towel that they dry themselves off with that towel has to be put out

32:58.160 --> 33:03.120
of the room because it's dirty then then the next layer of washing with the next soap go through two

33:03.120 --> 33:08.880
hours of this they're finally done turn to leave to go to their job go to their whatever and on the

33:08.880 --> 33:14.720
way out brush their elbow against the door and they have to start all over again and you will

33:14.720 --> 33:20.080
stop them at that point and say you will miss this interview you will not get this job and they will

33:20.080 --> 33:26.400
say yes i know but i'm not going to be able to function and i'm just it's dirty i know my elbow

33:26.400 --> 33:31.440
i know i'm going to touch it then and then i'll get in my face and i just have to start over i'm

33:31.440 --> 33:35.760
not going to be able to get anything done today anyway so i need to go wash if i don't wash i'm

33:35.760 --> 33:41.600
not going to be able to and back they go and hours and hours of this people with ocd spend half

33:41.600 --> 33:48.160
their waking hours doing this people with ocd just have constant sequences of numbers going in their

33:48.160 --> 33:55.120
heads constant jingles intrusive thoughts they cannot stop thinking what if i don't stop the car

33:55.120 --> 34:00.480
at the next stop sign what if i run down this person they have the intrusive thoughts of i'm

34:00.480 --> 34:05.600
absolutely sure i struck somebody at that street crossing back there i've got to go back and check

34:06.240 --> 34:10.400
okay they don't see anybody there they drive on five miles down the road

34:11.040 --> 34:16.320
probably the person flew off into the bushes i have to go back and check i have to go back

34:16.320 --> 34:21.360
and check they can never leave their home because they've left the door unlocked they go back they

34:21.360 --> 34:26.400
check the door is locked they have to go back they left the gas on they left the light on this is

34:26.400 --> 34:32.320
absolutely paralyzing intrusive thoughts what if i leaned over and struck the person next to me

34:32.320 --> 34:37.760
what if somebody kills my loved ones you can't stop the thoughts they just keep coming at these

34:37.760 --> 34:43.920
people they cannot enter or leave a place there is a paralysis about entering and leaving built

34:43.920 --> 34:49.680
around this sort of almost magical exclusionary power that you get a transition into a place

34:49.680 --> 34:56.080
they cannot enter a room until they do a prime number of tapings on the wall before entering

34:56.080 --> 35:00.720
they can then not enter the room until if that's prime number and then a different prime number

35:00.720 --> 35:07.920
with their left foot shaking completely arbitrary symptoms of having to enter and leave numerology

35:07.920 --> 35:13.920
these people cannot begin a meal until the utensils are absolutely symmetrical and lined up and

35:13.920 --> 35:19.200
they're never perfectly symmetrical and the entering and leaving ritual is never done right

35:19.200 --> 35:24.000
and they certainly can't enter the classroom unless the number of steps from here to the door

35:24.000 --> 35:29.920
is two times an interval that's with this a very mathematical quality to it and it's never quite

35:29.920 --> 35:34.720
right and you've got to do it all over again and what's been pointed out one of the really

35:34.720 --> 35:41.040
interesting sort of insights as to what ocd is about is that this is an anxiety disorder this

35:41.040 --> 35:47.760
is a pathological attempt to impose structure to impose predictability to impose control

35:47.760 --> 35:54.640
in a world where everything is pathologically provoking of a sense of dis ease and uncertainty

35:54.640 --> 36:01.840
and anxiety and the absolute horrifying version of ocd that i've heard described is this metaphor

36:01.840 --> 36:07.520
where this is straight out of ethology this is a fixed action pattern we all know the fixed action

36:07.520 --> 36:13.280
pattern of a dog is settling down at night on its blanket and what does the dog do it circles a few

36:13.280 --> 36:18.400
times before it settles down but then it circles a couple of more times and just as it's ready to

36:18.400 --> 36:22.720
then it circles a few more and fine and you can see at some point the dog doesn't even want to do

36:22.720 --> 36:28.800
this anymore and it takes a while longer in another 30 seconds before the dog can finally escape from

36:28.800 --> 36:37.520
this fixed action pattern and sit down in ocd the person never ever escapes the person spends forever

36:37.520 --> 36:44.000
circling on the blanket being unable to finally lie down and rest because they are just consumed

36:44.000 --> 36:50.160
with these rituals with these obsessive intrusive thoughts and what you get is this is completely

36:50.160 --> 36:57.040
paralyzing okay here's an example of an obsessive belief that we all have okay can anybody identify this

37:02.720 --> 37:08.000
okay here's what it is this is an aerial view in fact it's a satellite photograph of here

37:08.000 --> 37:13.760
this is a tray of rice crispy treats and you've just walked into the room and it looks like this

37:13.760 --> 37:18.240
and for a huge percentage of us within a minute or so it's going to look like this

37:18.720 --> 37:24.720
because we all feel this compulsive need to take a knife and cut off that edge okay let me just

37:24.720 --> 37:30.720
canvas you on all of that okay how many of you okay how many of you do this for starters i certainly

37:30.720 --> 37:37.280
do okay how many of you have those who do this cut off this bit here because it doesn't really count

37:37.280 --> 37:42.720
on your diet okay a couple of hands how many of you cut it off because what's perfectly obvious is

37:42.720 --> 37:47.520
going from this to this decreases the total perimeter so that it will stay fresher that way

37:48.720 --> 37:56.320
okay problems that how many of you wind up doing it because it's just getting at you that

37:56.320 --> 38:01.200
it's the knife's just there and you just have to cut it off and smooth out the edge yes that's why

38:01.200 --> 38:05.760
we all do it and then what you then decide is that there's this little bump here which requires you

38:05.760 --> 38:11.200
to trim this out and then there's a little bump and off you go with that and we all wind up doing

38:11.200 --> 38:17.600
that but if this is what you did around the clock for your entire life it would destroy it and what

38:17.600 --> 38:23.600
is most striking with people with ocd is you could never go through the sequence i just did

38:23.600 --> 38:29.840
there's no insight the person does not sit there and say help there's something wrong with me i feel

38:29.840 --> 38:36.160
this need to wash my hands six hours a day they say help there's something wrong with me i can never

38:36.160 --> 38:44.400
get clean i'm just so dirty everything i do makes me dirty there's no insight into it okay so where

38:44.400 --> 38:50.320
does this fit in again our modern version of religion our modern very secularly influenced

38:50.320 --> 38:57.200
version of religion so often involves an emphasis on what religion is about is counseling the trouble

38:57.200 --> 39:01.680
what religion is about is holding the hands of the newlyweds and making sure they understand

39:01.680 --> 39:06.960
what they're getting into what religion is about is comforting the distance the bereaved what religion

39:06.960 --> 39:12.480
is about is the good works but this is not what religion has often been about throughout history

39:12.480 --> 39:17.680
often the religious leaders are not necessarily the ones who are most psychotherapeutically

39:17.680 --> 39:23.040
minded or the most galvanizing of people into the good works often religious leaders have been

39:23.040 --> 39:28.080
the ones at the head of a crusade often religious leaders have been the ones with the most vivid

39:28.080 --> 39:33.440
images of what hell and damnation would be like but often what religious leaders have been are the

39:33.440 --> 39:40.080
people who are best at doing the rituals and that has been another thread of religious practice

39:40.080 --> 39:46.720
throughout history of religious leaders as often being among the most fervent the most accomplished

39:46.720 --> 39:51.680
at carrying out of rituals now let me give you a sense of this because as i began to read more

39:51.680 --> 39:57.040
on this this absolutely astonished me because i knew very little about this stuff just the scale

39:57.040 --> 40:02.640
of this and starting off with what will probably be a fairly alien religion for most of you in here

40:02.640 --> 40:08.800
and then moving into examples closer to home looking at orthodox very traditional hinduism

40:08.800 --> 40:15.200
looking at the behaviors of a brahman an individual who devotes their entire life to ritualistic

40:15.200 --> 40:22.640
practice in pursuit of their religion a brahman a highly observant brahman spends six hours a day

40:22.640 --> 40:29.040
in cleansing rituals and there are detailed rules as to which hand you wash in what sequence

40:29.040 --> 40:34.640
how many times you wash each hand separately how many each one together the sequence with which

40:34.640 --> 40:40.320
you wash out one side of your mouth versus the other with water there are set rules for brahmans

40:40.320 --> 40:46.160
as to how you were supposed to lie down at night dictating what your first sight is in the morning

40:46.160 --> 40:51.360
there are set rules as to what direction you must face when defecating in terms of what you

40:51.360 --> 40:56.720
were looking at at the time there are set rules for rituals you have to do when entering a temple

40:56.720 --> 41:02.880
when leaving a temple there are set rules for how many breaths you take through each nostril

41:02.880 --> 41:08.080
you close one nostril during your prayers for a certain number of breaths then you close the other

41:08.080 --> 41:13.840
and all of these are very carefully stipulated the number of mouthfuls of food the number of

41:13.840 --> 41:20.320
times you chew per mouthful the number of prayers you have to say per day sequences of magic numbers

41:20.320 --> 41:26.880
all of this is absolutely spelled out and orthodox brahmans consume their entire days doing this

41:27.680 --> 41:32.880
okay next example orthodox Judaism spectacularly yeah question

41:36.960 --> 41:43.120
great okay hang on for a while we will come to that that's a superb question as to why they seem

41:43.120 --> 41:50.960
to have lots to do with cleansing and food preparation wow thank you okay do you want to

41:50.960 --> 41:54.800
why don't we take a five minute break right now and you can all store in the front here for handouts

41:56.880 --> 42:07.040
lots of opinions here lots of thoughts once again that same thing i mentioned two days ago three days

42:07.040 --> 42:13.200
ago whenever this is very provocative stuff take advantage of the course website put up some of

42:13.200 --> 42:19.280
your opinions get dial-ons going on this because people lots of times have extremely strong opinions

42:19.280 --> 42:24.320
on this and very interesting ones take advantage of this a couple of questions that just came up

42:24.320 --> 42:29.520
how come people with ocd don't come down with learned helplessness why aren't they depressed

42:29.520 --> 42:37.280
because part of the fuel behind ocd is you're always convinced aha one more now i know instead of

42:37.280 --> 42:44.240
doing it 17 times 18 if i do it 18 then it's going to be perfect you've always just figured out

42:44.240 --> 42:49.360
not only do i have to do the six hours of washing but make sure i never step on a crack and then i

42:49.360 --> 42:54.560
won't break my mother's back you're always figuring out the next step then pointing out we're about to

42:54.560 --> 43:00.320
go in a direction where what are the advantages of a mild version of ocd and we're discussing this

43:00.320 --> 43:05.920
in a religious context i should point out in a secular context there's a tremendous advantage

43:05.920 --> 43:12.720
to a mild version of ocd what it does is get you into a place like stanford what it does is work

43:12.720 --> 43:18.720
to a tremendous advantage given how regimented and disciplined a lot of folks are in here get it in

43:18.720 --> 43:24.480
the right context blah blah that theme that we have again and again okay shifting over just seeing

43:24.480 --> 43:31.360
orthodox brahman belief and hinduism absolutely dominated virtually full time with ritualistic

43:31.360 --> 43:38.960
behaviors orthodox jewelry a spectacular number of laws built around food preparation the kosher

43:38.960 --> 43:45.360
laws very detailed rules as to how long of a time interval between eating one type of food and another

43:45.360 --> 43:51.440
type of food if you inadvertently mix up the silverware with different types of food ritualistic

43:51.440 --> 43:56.720
cleansing rituals that you have to go through involving putting the utensils in dirt for months

43:56.720 --> 44:03.120
on end and special prayers that have to be said rules about how you enter and leave a holy place

44:03.120 --> 44:08.480
involving certain prayers involving a certain ritualistic touching that you have to make on the

44:08.480 --> 44:15.920
door jam there all sorts of magic numbers the number 18 has magical powers and orthodox Judaism

44:15.920 --> 44:22.160
and it's built around numbers of times you have to say a prayer multiples of 18 you have these prayer

44:22.160 --> 44:27.520
shawls that have strings on the end which have 18 knots in them and they have to be pulled a certain

44:27.520 --> 44:34.720
number of times here's one of the amazing examples of ritualism okay these numbers have magical powers

44:34.720 --> 44:42.080
and orthodox Judaism and you will note 365 is the number of days in the year 248 is the number of

44:42.080 --> 44:47.040
bones that people believed were in the bodies during the middle ages when this evolved and together

44:47.040 --> 44:57.280
613 according to the holy books there are 613 rules for daily behaviors 365 prohibitions every day

44:57.280 --> 45:02.560
248 things that have to be done every day the preponderance of the prohibitions leading one

45:02.560 --> 45:07.520
clearly fairly depressive rabbi back when to be saying obviously it would have been better if

45:07.520 --> 45:11.440
none of us were born given the fact that there were more things that we could mess up by doing

45:11.440 --> 45:16.800
but what you see here is which is highly ritualistic the number of prohibitions equaling the number of

45:16.800 --> 45:22.400
days of the year the number of ritual constraints equaling the number of bones in the body 613

45:22.400 --> 45:27.840
is the magic number okay where did these numbers come from very often in religious rituals what

45:27.840 --> 45:34.480
you find is a number has symbolic value because it's got a certain appeal for making learning

45:34.480 --> 45:41.680
easier it is not by chance that a base 10 society came up with 10 commandments because 10 commandments

45:41.680 --> 45:47.600
that are much easier to remember than 9 or 11 what are these about you would say okay well there's

45:47.600 --> 45:53.120
some sort of ritualistic content here god the number of things god doesn't want us to do each day

45:53.120 --> 45:57.120
is equal to the number of days of the year the number thing god wants us to do is equal to the

45:57.120 --> 46:02.880
number of bones in the body okay great device for remembering the rules but here's the amazing

46:02.880 --> 46:08.880
thing nobody knows the rules you look through thousands of pages of commentary stretching back

46:08.880 --> 46:15.040
centuries and the rules aren't written down and various rabbis have made a living arguing over

46:15.040 --> 46:21.360
what are the 365 things you aren't supposed to do each day in other words the numbers are more

46:21.360 --> 46:28.080
important than the content the content is less critical than the fact that whatever they are

46:28.080 --> 46:33.760
there's 365 things that god doesn't want you to do and whatever they are there's 248 that god

46:33.760 --> 46:39.440
wants you to do the number that you are attributing to god is more important in that case than the

46:39.440 --> 46:48.160
content okay classic classic obsessive numerology switching over traditional orthodox islam what

46:48.160 --> 46:54.320
you find there is very detailed rules as to what foods you can eat what the first food is you're

46:54.320 --> 47:00.320
supposed to eat each day there are rules as to how you enter and leave a holy place there are rules

47:00.320 --> 47:07.120
for very ornate cleansing after release relieving yourself very very detailed rules when you are

47:07.120 --> 47:13.360
washing out your mouth how many mouthfuls of water which hands you wash in which sequence the exact

47:13.360 --> 47:19.920
same thing exact same rules as with an ocd person after the showering explicitly written down when

47:19.920 --> 47:25.120
a man is washing himself at the ends of the at the end of the cleansing should he happen to touch

47:25.120 --> 47:31.680
his penis he has to do the whole sequence all over again magic numbers thought to have powers there

47:31.680 --> 47:38.800
seven ten seventy and a hundred apparently have magical powers in islam and you have very explicit

47:38.800 --> 47:45.920
concrete instructions about them Muhammad himself wrote down that a man who says a prayer with clean

47:45.920 --> 47:52.720
teeth gets seventy times the brownie points as a man saying his prayers without them multiples of

47:52.720 --> 47:58.480
magic numbers with all of that and probably for most of you by now what will be the most familiar

47:58.480 --> 48:04.720
is looking at orthodox christianity and you have rosaries in the counting of rosaries you have three

48:04.800 --> 48:10.000
is a magic number you have very detailed numbers of times you are supposed to say prayers you have

48:10.000 --> 48:15.040
rules for entering and leaving churches even in christian groups that are viewed as some of the

48:15.040 --> 48:20.560
least ritualistic some of the most cerebral in some ways you look at the Lutherans Lutherans

48:20.560 --> 48:26.720
have set rules for prayers that are only said during even years prayers that are only said during odd

48:26.720 --> 48:33.440
years all of these versions of orthodoxy are absolutely shocked through with rituals built

48:33.440 --> 48:39.200
around cleansing of the body food preparation entering and leaving of significant places

48:39.200 --> 48:45.840
and numerology it's the exact same list as you find with ocd and Freud a hundred years ago

48:45.840 --> 48:52.080
came up with this amazing quote to that regard Freud described obsessive compulsive disorder ocd

48:52.080 --> 49:01.440
quote as an individual religiosity and religion as a universal obsessional compulsion he absolutely

49:01.440 --> 49:05.840
linked the two now just when you're thinking that i'm standing here and i'm started going to start

49:05.840 --> 49:11.680
pathologizing religious belief from sort of a medical psychiatric standpoint the exact same

49:11.680 --> 49:17.280
conclusion has been reached by religious leaders over the centuries as well in the 15th century

49:17.920 --> 49:24.800
there was st. Loyola no st. Ignatius of Loyola and what this guy did was he wrote this long track

49:24.800 --> 49:31.040
describing scrupulosity scrupulosity is not a common word in english anymore but it's opposite

49:31.040 --> 49:37.520
certainly is being unscrupulous being scrupulous having scrupial scrupulosity at the time was

49:37.520 --> 49:44.240
defined as someone who was going through religious ritual for its own sake someone who was not thinking

49:44.240 --> 49:49.760
about the content but was just doing the ritual and he wrote this long track to catholic priest

49:49.760 --> 49:55.520
saying watch out for people like these people who were coming and being super devout but you will

49:55.520 --> 50:00.560
notice they're just doing the rituals without thinking of the content your job is to recognize

50:00.560 --> 50:06.160
them and guide them back into actually focusing on the content they shouldn't be doing the rituals

50:06.160 --> 50:11.760
for their own sake there's a danger of people like that showing up in the Talmud an orthodox

50:11.760 --> 50:17.600
Judaism the exact same thing there is a law in there that when you read the holy book of Judaism

50:17.600 --> 50:23.200
the Torah you were not allowed to do it by heart you have to actually read the words because there

50:23.200 --> 50:29.200
is an injunction to think about the content don't do it in a rote way and Muhammad himself

50:29.200 --> 50:34.800
in Islam wrote down that people who give prayers without thinking about the content the prayers

50:34.800 --> 50:41.040
don't count even religious leaders for centuries for millennia have recognized the pull of religious

50:41.040 --> 50:47.440
ritual for its own sake to have to admonish religious adherents to pay attention to the content

50:47.440 --> 50:53.040
because the ritual takes on a life of its own where the numbers the content the ritual is more

50:53.040 --> 51:10.000
important than the actual thought behind it yeah

51:13.280 --> 51:19.040
exactly and that was that point that transition talking about schizotypillism there's much more

51:19.120 --> 51:26.000
resemblance to the large theological building blocks of religion of spirituality what are our

51:26.000 --> 51:31.520
military's principles what do we believe do we believe you always follow orders you never follow

51:31.520 --> 51:37.200
orders you don't agree with what's more important value sort of stuff this is instead in the realm of

51:37.200 --> 51:41.920
religious practice and this is the realm of very orthodox religious practice absolutely

51:41.920 --> 51:47.600
completely different realm so where am i heading with this obviously emphasizing the similarity

51:47.600 --> 51:53.680
of the traits and that whole business that once again have a six hour compulsion to wash your

51:53.680 --> 52:00.720
hands each day and have it occur in the secular context of ocd it destroys your life you cannot

52:00.720 --> 52:06.960
function in society you are peripheralized you are mentally ill and that exact same theme get it

52:06.960 --> 52:13.200
right in the right context and this is protected this is honored this is rewarded get it in the

52:13.200 --> 52:20.160
right setting now nothing about being able to do rituals and turn them from your own private ocd

52:20.160 --> 52:26.720
into the religious setting this is not a process for making the anxiety go away it's very important

52:26.720 --> 52:31.360
when people are pulling off these rituals in a religious setting it's not to make the anxiety

52:31.360 --> 52:37.920
go away it's to share it it's to share it over time and space with a larger community it's to

52:37.920 --> 52:44.800
take this nameless dread and to give it a name and to have that name come with feeding instructions

52:44.800 --> 52:50.320
and all sorts of rules for how to please the source of the named dread at this point it's not to

52:50.320 --> 52:57.440
make the anxiety go away it's to make the anxiety shared now from this transitioning from this notion

52:57.440 --> 53:03.280
that okay in the right setting the same exact trait that can ruin your life can in fact be

53:03.280 --> 53:09.840
enveloped rewarded welcomed protected in the context of religious belief now taking it one step

53:09.840 --> 53:37.520
further yeah question sure no it definitely doesn't but from that standpoint this is

53:37.520 --> 53:42.000
speaking to one aspect of what it's doing and we still haven't come to the question that was up

53:42.000 --> 53:47.200
there before isn't there an ecological reason why there should be these rituals about cleansing

53:47.200 --> 53:51.760
and food preparation we'll come to that shortly but the other point you brought up maybe this is

53:51.760 --> 53:57.200
to foster a sense of community but this comes back to the question around there before why should

53:57.200 --> 54:03.680
people in a communal sense feel better why should we all feel better when we do rituals and our

54:03.680 --> 54:07.920
rituals of counting the stairs and making sure the application really went down the mailbox

54:07.920 --> 54:13.280
why do we feel even better when we do it in the context of the community you're absolutely right

54:13.280 --> 54:19.760
that these are meant to foster the group shared features of religiosity and spirituality the

54:19.760 --> 54:24.960
question then becomes why does it work why do we respond to it why do we need shamans and

54:24.960 --> 54:31.200
why do we respond to this ability to share these customs why is it the trait of 18 year olds all

54:31.200 --> 54:36.480
over the world to try to invent a whole bunch of generationally shared rituals that lets the world

54:36.480 --> 54:41.200
know i have nothing whatsoever to do with those appalling people who embarrass me my parents

54:41.200 --> 54:47.680
what's that whole separation that goes in why is it that individuation is very often going hand in

54:47.680 --> 54:53.440
hand with i need a community to do this individuation with that in a sense is the question and that

54:53.440 --> 54:59.360
kind of brings us to this next issue looking at sort of a next scale of this application of this

54:59.360 --> 55:05.760
ritualism by far one of the weirdest stories that france kafka ever wrote was the hunger artist

55:05.760 --> 55:12.800
and this is a story about a person who performs starving his performance is he comes into a town

55:12.800 --> 55:18.240
and he's locked up in a cage in the middle of town and he entertains he performs people performs there

55:18.240 --> 55:23.760
by starving himself and people come and watch him starve and initially you read this and this

55:23.760 --> 55:28.960
sounds like one of the more bizarre parables that kafka has come up with until you read that during

55:28.960 --> 55:34.720
the middle ages there were hunger artists there were people who performed in european cities

55:34.720 --> 55:41.280
starving themselves in a ritualistic way for people to come and watch suddenly we now look at a next

55:41.280 --> 55:48.240
level the notion of performing rituals and people who are very good at it once again what are religious

55:48.240 --> 55:54.480
leaders about mostly these days we think of them in terms of people who are empathic people who are

55:54.480 --> 56:00.000
able to use the religious tradition they come from to make people treat each other better to

56:00.000 --> 56:04.640
comfort people during troubled times but back to that issue that some of the time what a religious

56:04.640 --> 56:10.160
leader is about is someone who is excellent at doing rituals and when you look at the history

56:10.160 --> 56:16.640
of religion not only do you have the capacity for somebody to suddenly lose themselves to finally

56:16.640 --> 56:22.480
have the same life destroying rituals being sanctioned and protected you have people who

56:22.480 --> 56:28.800
could make a living performing the rituals you can have people who are aptly rewarded for doing so

56:28.800 --> 56:34.800
some examples starting off with traditional hinduism there is a mantra there called the

56:34.800 --> 56:40.080
gayatri mantra which i'm sure i'm mispronouncing but in traditional brahmanism you are supposed

56:40.080 --> 56:45.920
to say this mantra two million four hundred thousand times in a lifetime to guarantee a good

56:45.920 --> 56:51.280
afterlife and what happens is you have these aging captains of industry who were worried that may

56:51.280 --> 56:55.440
not have quite gotten the right number in there and are feeling the years catching up with them

56:55.440 --> 57:01.200
and what do you do you hire yourself a bunch of brahmins to come and say the prayer two million

57:01.200 --> 57:06.160
four hundred thousand times for you and you say it in appropriate multiples there are set rules

57:06.160 --> 57:13.680
you hire two hundred forty of them so each of them says ten thousand hundred thousand a thousand

57:13.680 --> 57:18.000
ten thousand each of them says a whole lot of them and they all say the same number and there

57:18.080 --> 57:22.560
are rules for what sort of tent city you put up for them in your backyard and what sort of feast

57:22.560 --> 57:29.040
you throw for them you hire people to come and do the rituals for you that get you your afterlife

57:29.040 --> 57:35.920
switching over to judaism these rules of orthodox food preparation there is an entire job you can get

57:35.920 --> 57:41.920
built around ritualistic preparation of food now there is a certain primary level of this

57:41.920 --> 57:47.120
which is people who make a living making sure food is prepared in a kosher way that they slaughter

57:47.120 --> 57:52.160
animals things of that sort but there's a whole second level people who make a living watching

57:52.160 --> 57:57.600
the folks who prepare the food you have rabbis who make a living sitting around and slaughter

57:57.600 --> 58:02.640
houses and making sure the animals are slaughtered in a ritualistically appropriate way these guys

58:02.640 --> 58:07.840
don't do anything with their own hands their entire job is to watch and make sure the rituals

58:07.840 --> 58:13.520
are done right so that you can produce like fat free tofu hot dogs that would bring a smile to the

58:13.520 --> 58:18.880
lips of the patriarchs it's done so ritualistically correctly these guys make a living doing this

58:18.880 --> 58:23.680
and then the version probably we are most familiar with the american experience you have the high

58:23.680 --> 58:29.840
school graduation you have the opening of the new town whatever and what happens the local clergyman

58:29.840 --> 58:36.960
comes out and does a convocation says a prayer is invited to come and do a ritual to mark this

58:36.960 --> 58:42.160
community transition and our response here is well yeah of course that's the guy's job and that's

58:42.160 --> 58:48.320
exactly the point you could make a living doing these rituals and you can do that job these days

58:48.320 --> 58:54.640
complete with health insurance and a retirement package and a 401k and all of that you make a

58:54.640 --> 59:00.400
living doing rituals and when you look at the history of religion suddenly what you see is an

59:00.400 --> 59:05.280
inevitable outcome of that if there's somebody who's spending all his time washing his hands

59:05.280 --> 59:09.840
ritualistically for the good of the community there's some peasant out there who's got to work

59:09.840 --> 59:15.280
by the sweat of his brow to make bread for two people instead of one and there's an amazing novel

59:15.280 --> 59:19.840
a science fiction novel and absolutely caught this which struck me as like one of the truly

59:19.840 --> 59:25.600
horrible novels in terms of writing style almost as bad as asimov but in there was this brilliant

59:25.600 --> 59:31.760
idea a book called zenicide by a writer named orson scott card and had this brilliant idea that

59:31.760 --> 59:38.000
absolutely caught this and this was on as always a multi-planetary empire and the people running

59:38.000 --> 59:43.840
the evil empire figured out the people on some planet were biologically very very prone towards

59:43.840 --> 59:49.120
being extremely smart we could dissect that in lots of ways perhaps the particular prenatal

59:49.120 --> 59:53.920
environment on that planet but they nonetheless worried that this planet had great danger for

59:53.920 --> 59:58.800
producing revolutionaries that were going to leave the overthrow of the empire so what they did

59:58.800 --> 01:00:05.840
was invent a virus a virus which caused obsessive compulsive disorder and they infected a subset

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:10.800
of people on this planet with the virus and the virus integrated into the dna so it would be passed

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:17.040
on multi-generationally and suddenly you had a subset of people who were paralyzed with ocd with

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:22.560
counting rituals and all of that and what did they manage to foist off on the rest of the population

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:28.160
these were religious experiences they were having and within a few generations this had become a

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:33.280
priestly class who sat around all day carrying out their obsessive rituals and the rest of the

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:38.240
population couldn't begin to think of revolting against the empire because they were spending all

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:43.120
day long having to come up with enough food to feed the priestly class and what you suddenly had

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:50.000
was a paralysis built around an entire class that does nothing other than carry out these rituals

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.600
and that planet was no worry to the rest of the empire at that point what you wind up seeing is

01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:02.640
that truly involved ritualistic religious belief is often at the cost of doing anything else

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:09.360
there's a spectacular example of this historically and this is a 16th century augustinian monk in

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:14.640
germany named luder and this guy happened to have left a lot of written records and this guy is a

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:21.760
classic example of this he was the son the only son of a very aggressive very violent father there

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.880
was some suggestion that the father had in fact killed somebody once and abroad the son was absolutely

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:33.840
terrified of him and was extremely obedient to him very anxious very psychosomatic young man

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:39.360
one day he is out for a walk it's caught in a lightning storm out in an open field has a panic

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:44.800
attack there because the lightning storm makes a devotional agreement at that point if he can

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:50.480
survive this lightning storm he will become a monk he promises god that he survives he becomes a

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:56.640
monk and he is absolutely paralyzed with his ritualistic training he leaves records about

01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:02.560
when he had his first mass he fainted beforehand he was so nervous about doing it wrong the mass

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.360
went on three times the length that was supposed to because he kept having to stop and start over

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:12.560
again because he was sure he had done something wrong he spent approximately five hours a day

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:18.960
in confession with his priestly mentor there his sort of advisor there confessing to every this is

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:23.120
a guy who lived in a monastery he didn't have a chance to do anything sinful but he'd be in there

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:28.480
five hours a day when i said this prayer i wasn't mindful enough about it i did it by rote when i

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:33.200
did this i wasn't thinking enough about this i pretty sure i didn't wash my hands enough

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:38.240
before doing this prayer i did this wrong god is angry at me for doing this i'm sure god is angry

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:44.640
at me for doing this and records his mentor this elderly priest eventually in exasperation

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:50.400
said one of the most astonishingly modern psychoanalytically insightful things imaginable

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:57.840
he said enough already god isn't angry with you for some reason you are very angry with god

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:03.360
god doesn't care about how many times you're washing your hands and the most definitive thing

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:08.880
about this young man this young priest was something he left in his records he washed

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:14.640
hours and hours a day an exact quote from him the more i wash the dirtier i get

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:22.320
and this is ocd and why do we know so much about this man because we know him 500 years later

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:27.840
not by his latin name of luder we know him by his more westernized name of martin luther

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:33.840
this was martin luther the founder of protestantism and these were the transitional events in his life

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:39.600
and talk about somebody who takes his personal affliction and turns it into perhaps the most

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:45.440
influential event of the last thousand years in western european history this is someone who turned

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:51.600
it into the biggest display of failing to obey his father that anybody has seen in the history of

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:58.800
catholicism and this was a person paralyzed by obsessive compulsive disorder so what we get here

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:05.280
at this point is the obvious question who invented knocking on wood for good luck who's the hindu who

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:10.800
had some sort of obsession with the number 24 or the jew with an obsession with the number 18

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:16.160
who got this belief that god was completely obsessed with the numbers of bones in the body and that's

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:22.240
how many things you should do well we have here is not only the recognition that if you are ocd

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:28.720
religion can provide a sanctuary if you are ocd in the right setting you can in fact make a living

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:35.360
by being religiously ritualistic but the recognition that probably people with strong obsessive compulsive

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:41.760
tendencies had something to do with the invention of many of these rituals i suspect historically

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.960
that's where it has come from so that brings up the issue that was brought up before why should

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:53.440
these rituals be so similar you look at the prohibitions for example in judaism more than 200

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:58.640
of these have to do with food preparation and cleansing you see the sequence in any of these

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:06.000
and the top four in ocd are identical to the top four in all of these religions cleansing of the body

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:13.840
food preparation entering and leaving significant religious places and numerology numbers why should

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:20.480
that be basically two types of explanations one is we may be seeing some sort of convergence

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:25.280
it's not by chance that people are highly ritualistically concerned with making sure their

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:30.560
bodies are clean and that their food is correctly prepared and i suspect that has part to do with

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:35.760
it but i suspect what we're also seeing and with records of people like martin luther what we're

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:41.280
also seeing is because some of the people who invented some of these religious rituals had a

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:48.000
background of ocd maybe not fully paralytic versions but nonetheless somebody spending five

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.800
hours a day washing his hands and five hours a day confessing about how he didn't wash his hands

01:05:52.800 --> 01:06:00.160
enough this does not seem to be a mild version the more i wash the dirtier i get okay what i think

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:07.440
you wind up seeing is that historically all sorts of folks generating rituals ocd is estimated to

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:12.720
have an incidence anywhere from one to ten percent in the population depending on how you define it

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:20.080
the continuum and what you have is i suspect in periods of religious crisis cultural crisis

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:26.000
during a period of persecution during the period where whatever is currently in shape is not working

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.040
the right person at the right moment comes forward and in effect says this is how i have

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:36.880
been privately honoring our lord all these years and i am offering it to all of you to see

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:42.000
this is what i have been doing and in the right place and time it catches on and it turns into

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.240
the thing that is the ritual for the rest of the community within decades okay so what i've been

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:54.000
suggesting here and what i also emphasize is none of this is original with me except for the notion

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.520
that the ocd has something to do with the invention of these rituals these ideas go back decades go

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:05.280
back centuries that there is a parallelism between the symptoms of what we call schizotypillism

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:11.360
and the metamagical backbone of religious theology there is a parallelism between what we call

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:18.160
obsessive compulsive disorder and the ritualism of mainstream orthodox religion and this key point

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:25.280
that the exact same behaviors which in one context destroys your life has you peripheralized do it

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:30.320
right do it in the right context and it is not peripheralizing it makes you very honored and

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:44.640
powerful there are more themes yeah wonderful question would you expect to see different

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:51.520
incidences of ocd type traits in different cultures depending on how secular the society is how

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:57.280
ritualistic the religion is you look at for example catholicism or high episcopalianism

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:02.640
highly ritualistic compared to lutherans or unitarians or quakers at the other end would

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:07.760
you expect to see different different incidences absolutely i don't know if anybody's studying

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.960
that that would be exactly a prediction you would expect okay a related one which taps

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:18.160
into the lecture on friday would you expect to see differences in the incidence of depression

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:24.400
depending on religiosity and boring do you see that with a vengeance one of the healthiest things

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:30.320
you could do with your life is to be religious and to be highly religious it is a very strong

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:36.400
protector against major depression religious belief extends your life expectancy and that's

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:42.240
after you control for it changes risk factors you're less likely to drink to excess all of that

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:48.480
what is the big issue in that field is do the health benefits of religiosity merely come from

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:53.040
the social community that you get typically by being religious the question early in the

01:08:53.040 --> 01:09:00.080
lecture today religiosity versus spirituality that might be a realm to dissociate them spirituality

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:05.040
if it's a very personal one you wouldn't get the community do you still get the health benefits

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.400
nobody knows at this point but those are studies that people are doing but absolutely one of the

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:15.680
greatest things you can do out there to buffer yourself from depression is to be religiously

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:21.360
believing and walk through all the steps at the end of the lecture the other day elements of control

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:27.920
predictability explanation outlet and you will see exactly how religion taps into that okay couple

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:34.880
more threads here in terms of making sense of some of the covariance between biological phenomenon

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:39.600
behavior that we can explain and patterns of religious belief back to something we talked

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:46.160
about earlier in the course take a hungry pigeon and put it in a cage and instead of the behaviorist

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:52.480
circumstance where it has to press a lever umpteen times to get food you randomly reward it and what

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:59.280
we discussed there was a pigeon has a strong psychic need to come up with an attribution

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:05.840
what did i do to cause this food to appear and what we went through was the fact that if a pigeon

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:11.440
is hungry enough and the reward is both big enough and random enough the pigeon has a prepared learning

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:18.640
state to make it think ah whatever i just did is what caused that to occur and then you suddenly

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:24.240
have superstitious conditioning the capacity to get pigeons doing the most outlandishly

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.600
ritualistic things over and over and over in the belief that that's the cause of the food appearing

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:35.360
and what we heard was take a room full of hungry pigeons and randomly reward all of them with food

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.000
at different points and come back a few days later and every pigeon is going to be having its own

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:46.960
private belief system built around in order to get food i have to do x the enforcement of superstitious

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:52.560
belief and that is the term that is used in psychology and as we often have here is a question

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:58.400
of is this word a metaphor is this word an inappropriate metaphor or what is superstitious

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:04.720
belief and to go back to the question that came up here before why do we have a societal need for

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:09.760
shamans why do we have a societal need for much of this because we are trying to explain the

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:15.520
unexplainable we are trying to look for causal links of things that may or may not be associated

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:22.320
this is basically a way of describing superstition how tight of a link do you need between cause and

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:27.760
effect to believe that there has been cause and effect and this is coming down to statistical

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:33.520
relations and if you allow yourself to believe that this prayer could be answered but it wasn't

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.640
this time because i wasn't concentrating enough i need to do it a bit more fervently all of that

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:45.440
you have a system that allows us very readily to see causal links that may not be there now what is

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:51.440
the next interesting neurobiological piece of this is that take animals take rats and damage their

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:58.640
hippocampus and what you get with hippocampal damage then is you have more trouble making causal

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:04.160
sequential links and events what you wind up seeing and this next sentence is meant to be

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:10.640
as provocative as it will sound is when you have rats with hippocampal damage they are more vulnerable

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:18.960
to superstitious conditioning essentially what that is saying is that as you have a damaged

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:25.280
hippocampus you have less of a capacity to tell the difference between accurate cause and effect

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:31.760
linkages and ones that are merely statistically hinting of that or ones that may not be in the

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:37.360
slightest that connected with each other hippocampal damage and rats have a lower threshold for

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:42.560
superstitious conditioning and we can very readily run with that one in terms of what the

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:48.480
implications of that might be going on our usual sequence from in order to appreciate a biological

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:54.800
effect big gross lesion sort of stuff to once again the much more subtle realm we all differ

01:12:54.800 --> 01:13:00.560
in our number of hippocampal neurons in the amount of this enzyme in the amount of myelin and all

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:07.280
the biology we know all the individual differences a last disorder that winds up being interesting

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:13.680
there is a type of epilepsy which when you have it something happens to your religious belief system

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:18.480
and this is one of its characteristic features epileptic seizures as I think we've discussed

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:23.600
in here have characteristics as to what part of the brain they originate in and this is

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.960
epilepsy that originates in the temporal lobe the temporal lobe containing the hippocampus the

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:36.000
amygdala it's a big limbic area the temporal lobe temporal lobe epilepsy and about 30 years ago

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.640
a neurologist named Geshwin who was at Harvard he was probably the most influential neurologist of

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:46.480
the 20th century and Geshwin published a paper first describing what is now called temporal

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:53.120
lobe personality which is a cluster of personality traits that become far more common in people

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:58.800
with temporal lobe epilepsy once again not everybody with this personality profile has

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:04.320
epilepsy lurking there not everybody with temporal lobe epilepsy gets this profile but

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:09.200
statistically at a higher than expected rate what do you see with temporal lobe personality

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:16.640
first off the person becomes extremely serious and humorless okay you might say I would become

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:21.600
extremely serious and humorless if I suddenly came down with epilepsy what's the appropriate control

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:28.160
looking at other types of epilepsies of equivalent severity it's specific to temporal lobe so you

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:34.480
get the seriousness next thing you get is what is termed neophobia you don't like new things you

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:40.080
like to just do very familiar sorts of stuff the same small circle of friends the same very

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:46.160
relatively limited range of experiences okay if I had epilepsy I would suddenly get a lot more

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:52.080
sort of involuted in my lifestyle once again the controls or other types of epilepsies next thing

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:59.360
you see is this bizarre trait called hypergraphia which is people with temporal lobe personality

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:08.320
begin to write obsessively they feel a pressured need to write fourth trait and the most interesting

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.840
one of all is people with temporal lobe personality become obsessively interested

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:20.720
in religious and philosophical subjects and these are not people with uncontrolled seizures

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:25.600
happening all the time these are people whose seizures are relatively well controlled with

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:30.400
medication and once again well if I had this horrible neurological disease I'd suddenly

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:35.280
start getting more introspective but once again control for with the other types of epilepsy

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:40.800
and the classic temporal lobe patient that you see is somebody who is meeting a new neurologist

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.280
and says oh hi great to meet you you know I very strongly believe that a patient should be more

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:50.800
than just their symptoms so I've prepared this 60 page document here which is my philosophy about

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:55.600
life and meaning and at the next week's appointment comes back with a 40 page addendum this is what

01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:01.440
you wind up seeing and there's this fabulous story told showing that it's not that you get religious

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:06.800
you get interested in religious and philosophical subjects this great story showing this and this

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:12.640
was apparently shortly after Geshwin first published this paper and he had some neurology

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.600
resident who one day all the residents were in there and the neurology resident was summarizing

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:22.480
some patient this was some 13 year old boy in there with temporal lobe epilepsy and he went through

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:27.200
the meds and all of that and how the kid was doing and at the end said oh by the way I just read your

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.160
paper on that personality stuff this kid doesn't fit at all doesn't fit in the slightest clearly doing

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.800
some chest thumping kind of territorial stuff with the big man there and Geshwin says oh yeah

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:41.760
really how come and he said because I asked him if he's religious he said no he's not Geshwin says

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:46.240
idiot out of my way he pushes him and goes stormy down the hall and the residents running after him

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:50.560
bursts into this kid's room and says oh hi I'm Dr. Geshwin and puts him through a neurological

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:54.320
exam and all of that and goes through and asked him does he like baseball has the weather all of

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:58.720
that and then offhandedly says well by the way are you religious and the boy says no I'm not and

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:04.560
then Geshwin asks the critical question he says oh how come and this 13 year old kid gives this

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:09.680
hour-long lecture about the internal inconsistencies of Christ's Sermon on the mountain the epic of

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:15.200
Gilgamesh and sort of Ancadi's treatment of this and Bertrand Russell's critique of Christ

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:20.000
and like Geshwin just leaves the residents in their torture to listen to this kid for an hour

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.280
and it's not becoming religious it's becoming fascinated with the subject and there's even

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:31.200
been a paper published in a neurology journal doing the sort of paleo forensic neurology

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:37.440
by neurologist speculating someone who in history had temporal lobe epilepsy and this was Saint Paul

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:43.200
Saint Paul who had seizure auras as documented no evidence that the guy was particularly humorous

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:48.960
the guy was hyper graphic as hell and clearly had a very strong interest in religious and

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:54.560
philosophical subjects and you know this is fun but what do you make of the fact that somebody

01:17:54.640 --> 01:18:00.400
has an uncontrolled seizure in this part of the brain for 30 seconds once every six months

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:05.200
and they become more interested in religious subjects and at the end of the handout I cite

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:11.040
a novel that was published a couple years ago called lying awake fabulous novel by Mark Salisman

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:18.080
talking about a nun who is in the middle of a rather dispiriting life experience as a nun it

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:23.840
has not been what she was hoping for it has mostly been empty ritual and in the last few years

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:29.360
she's been having religious visions and this is the most exciting thing that has ever happened to her

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:34.720
what she also has to admit is she has kind of become a star of her convent after being this

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:40.720
very peripheral nobody and they're publishing books about her visions and people are coming to see her

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:45.760
and what becomes apparent halfway through the book is that she has a tumor in her temporal lobe which

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:51.600
is causing temporal lobe seizures and suddenly what does it mean that this is what these visions

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:56.800
have been about what does it mean that this is something that somebody in a white coat would call

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:02.880
a disease is this a disease and do I want my disease cured do I want this taken away from me

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:09.040
and it's extraordinary novel absolutely getting these features of temporal lobe personality and

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:14.240
getting at this issue which now is the core of what this whole lecture has been what do we do with

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:20.240
something like this what do we do with the possibility that have an uncontrolled burst of

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:26.320
action potentials in one part of your brain for 30 seconds every six months and in a somewhat

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:32.640
deterministic way that makes you more interested in religious subjects now summarizing here what I

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:37.760
think is really important for me to emphasize is what I'm not saying because that I've kind of

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.240
learned the hard way over the years I'm touching on the subject in this class what things I am not

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:49.680
saying I am not saying ooh some snotty you got to be crazy to be religious that's nonsense nor am I

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:56.400
saying even that most people who are are psychiatrically suspect I'm not saying that in the slightest

01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:04.080
what I'm saying is it is absolutely fascinating that the same exact traits which in a secular context

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:11.520
are life destroying separate you from the community and in the right setting are at the very core of

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:18.080
what is protected what is sanctioned what is rewarded what is valued in religious settings so often

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:23.600
and that there could be an underlying biology to this and what do we do with this what's most

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:29.040
interesting here is even if this describes one single person I mean to put cards on the table

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:34.400
I was raised in an extremely religious orthodox upbringing and I had a complete break with it

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:40.400
when I was about 14 and that process of completely breaking to the point now where I have no religion

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:46.320
I have no spirituality I'm utterly atheist and in passing it is probably the thing I most regret in

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:51.600
my life but it's something I appear not to be able to change the process of getting to that point

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:57.520
I view in retrospect as one of the most defining things in my life the process of turning into

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:04.160
that person from who I was what are we to make of the possibility that each one of us goes through

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:09.760
some equivalent version in our life deciding how religious or irreligious we are going to be

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:15.120
for a lot of us that are among the most defining features of who we are where we have wound up

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:20.560
with this and how we got there what do we make of the fact that even if there's one case in all

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:27.120
of human history of someone who got to wherever they were instead because of a neurotransmitter

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:33.120
hiccup because of a genetic influence because of something that we would see as deterministic as

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:38.800
your visions are due to a tumor in your temporal lobe what are we to do with this what I am also

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:44.960
saying here is it is just as interesting to ask this question about why some of us lose faith

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:50.560
as to ask this about why some of us gain faith it is just as biological it is simply much less

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:56.000
studied because there are fewer examples of it to study out there but it is just as biological of

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.600
the process and it is just as interesting if it has only been one person in all of history

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:07.520
once again coming to this issue what are we to make of who we are if even in one case

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:13.200
somebody has arrived at that point because of just a storm of neurotransmitter abnormalities

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:19.200
rather than the journey that all of us associate with helping to define who we are now this now

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:24.000
is a segue to wednesday's lecture which is going to look at all of these issues in a much more

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.160
subtle realm of this biology of what makes our personalities personalities and this is finally

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:35.760
moving outside of the realm of them and their diseases for what makes us us and at the core of

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:41.040
this is what does it mean that biology may have as much to do with it as I will hopefully convince

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:45.200
you of on wednesday so let's pick up them
