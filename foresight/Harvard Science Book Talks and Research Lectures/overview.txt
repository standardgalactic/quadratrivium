Checking Harvard Science Book Talks and Research Lectures/Daniel Everett, ＂Homo Erectus and the Invention of Human Language＂.txt
1. Homo erectus appeared around 2 million years ago and had a global presence until approximately 100,000 years ago. They coexisted with other human species like the Neanderthals and Denisovans during the Middle Paleolithic period.

2. Homo erectus is known for their sophisticated tools, such as the Acheulian handaxes, which required a high level of craftsmanship and could not have been created by accident. These tools demonstrate advanced planning and design capabilities.

3. The demise of Homo erectus is still a subject of debate among researchers. There are two main theories: either they gradually interbred with other human species (like Homo sapiens) and thus became us, or they were outcompeted or even killed by Homo sapiens due to the latter's superior intelligence and history of conflict with other humans.

4. The discovery of a hyoid bone in a Homo erectus fossil suggests that they may have had vocal cords capable of producing sounds, which implies they could have had some form of communication. However, having modern speech is not necessary or sufficient for language, as shown by deaf people who communicate effectively using sign language.

5. Language is a complex system of symbols and rules for combining those symbols, and it can be transmitted through various media beyond just human speech. While modern speech is an efficient way to transmit language, other species may produce sounds but do not have language as humans understand it.

6. Computers could theoretically communicate if they could produce two distinct sounds, but true language requires a more complex set of symbols and cultural context that goes beyond mere sound production.

7. Daniel Everett emphasizes the importance of understanding that language is about meaning and not just the physical sounds or signs used to convey it.
