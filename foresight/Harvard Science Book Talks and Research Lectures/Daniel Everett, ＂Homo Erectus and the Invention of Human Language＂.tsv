0	2640	Good evening, everyone.
2640	4920	Thanks so much for joining us tonight.
4920	8880	My name is Serena Longo, and on behalf of Harvard Book Store,
8880	12180	the Harvard University Division of Science, the Cabot Science
12180	15100	Library, and Mass Humanities, I'm so
15100	17640	excited to welcome you to our program tonight
17640	21040	with Daniel L. Everett presenting his latest book,
21040	26280	How Language Began, The Story of Humanity's Greatest Invention.
26280	27840	In just a moment, I'll turn things over
27840	29440	to Professor Melissa Franklin, who
29440	31480	will be introducing the program tonight.
31480	33960	But first, I'd like to say a few words about the series
33960	37680	and how you can learn more about our spring season.
37680	39760	The Science Book Talk series features talks
39760	41920	throughout the academic year by authors
41920	45340	of recently published science-related literature.
45340	48120	Just next week, we're very excited to welcome renowned
48120	51480	physicist and Princeton professor Paul J. Steinhart
51480	54520	for his book, The Second Kind of Impossible.
54520	57440	And in April, we'll be joined by a biologist and best-selling
57440	62600	author, Neil Shubin, for his new book, Some Assembly Required.
62600	64640	If you'd like to stay up to date on the series
64640	68360	and our newly posted talks, we have a few options.
68360	70920	Nearly all of our events are filmed and recorded
70920	71800	for the public.
71800	74000	You can access them at the web address,
74000	78880	science.fas.harvard.edu, slash book talks, which I've written
78880	81160	here on the board.
81160	83720	And also, you can find out announcements
83720	89840	about our spring lineup at harvard.com slash science.
89840	93320	And lastly, you can learn about Harvard Bookstore's many other
93320	97080	non-science book talks, which take place nearly every day
97080	101000	and in and around Harvard Square by visiting us at harvard.com
101000	104240	and signing up for our weekly email newsletter.
104240	107640	Tonight's talk will be followed by some time for your questions,
107640	110160	after which we'll have a book signing and refreshments
110160	112320	in the Cabot Science Library.
112320	114080	If you haven't picked up one already,
114080	116880	we have copies of how language began for sale
116880	120520	at the back of the hall and in the Cabot Library as well.
123440	125680	And as always, a few thank yous.
125680	128520	Thanks to our partners here at Harvard who make this series
128520	131280	and, of course, the cheese, all important cheese,
131280	133120	possible at the reception.
133120	135920	And thank you to all of you for being here,
135920	138920	for purchasing books that support an independent bookstore
138920	142040	and for affirming that science matters.
142040	144280	And finally, just a quick reminder, of course,
144280	147720	to silence your cell phones before the talk begins.
147720	149920	And so now I'm so pleased to bring up
149920	153240	Melissa Franklin, Harvard Physics Professor,
153240	156160	and the first woman ever to receive tenure
156160	157960	in the Harvard Physics Department.
157960	158460	Woo!
158460	163800	[? Applause. ?]
163800	166440	Hi, I'm really excited about this talk.
166440	169640	You know, we have a lot of these science book talks,
169640	174160	but they're mostly physics.
174160	177560	I'm really excited to have something really, we're
177560	183960	branching out, and I'm very excited about tonight's talk.
183960	187800	And if any of you have any ideas about more talks
187800	190640	on this subject, I see people here I've never seen before.
190640	193440	So I think it's a different audience than the physics
193440	195800	talks, maybe.
195800	196960	Yes?
196960	198480	Yes, OK.
198480	201680	And so if anybody has any ideas, my name's Franklin at Physics,
201680	207120	just ideas for interesting books in your part of sciencey
207120	209640	things, please let me know.
209640	213520	I want to introduce Daniel Everett, who
213520	217480	has a really interesting past.
217480	222760	And in particular, he started his education
222760	225320	at the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago.
225320	227400	I spent years in Chicago, but I've never
227400	228880	seen the Moody Bible Institute.
228880	233440	It's at La Sal in West Chicago Street.
233440	234920	Nobody's from Chicago.
234920	238000	OK, well, anyway, that's kind of an interesting start.
238000	240680	And from there, he went to Brazil
240680	245400	and got his PhD at the University of Campinas, which
245400	250600	is called Las Campos.
250600	256280	And he did his research also in the South Amazon,
256320	260560	studying the praja in the Amazon basin.
260560	263520	And now, he taught at a lot of different places.
263520	265800	He taught in Pittsburgh at Manchester,
265800	270800	which I think is in England, not Manchester by the sea,
270800	273520	and at Unicamp, which is also in Brazil.
273520	276880	And he's had many, many interesting positions
276880	278360	of leadership.
278360	281880	In the meantime, he has written many books.
281880	283480	The one I like the best, of course,
283480	286560	is Dark Matter of the Mind, because I'm a physicist.
286560	288080	And that's why, initially, I thought
288080	295280	this would be a good talk in this series.
295280	299440	Dark Matter of the Mind, even though you're linguist,
299440	301520	you know what dark matter is.
301520	307080	Yes, of the mind in the culturally articulated
307080	307720	unconscious.
307720	311200	Another one I like is, don't sleep.
311200	313240	There are snakes, life and language
313240	317080	in the Amazonian jungle, or Amazonian jungle.
317080	318960	The one we're talking about today,
318960	321520	how language began, the story of humanity's greatest
321520	323440	invention, and the one that's coming.
323440	326680	I'm also really excited about American Aristotle,
326680	330960	the life and mind of Charles Sanders Pierce.
330960	334640	There are other books, so you're not going to run out.
334640	338600	I mean, if you start now, and you're under 50,
338600	342480	you could get there.
342480	347320	Just to say, if you don't have the length of attention
347320	351120	for books, there's a fantastic New Yorker profile
351120	353880	on Dr. Everett.
353880	356040	So I'm very excited, because I hear
356040	357640	that it's going to be exciting.
357640	365360	Lots of really questions which are probing and questions.
365360	366400	Good probing questions.
366400	371240	So I'm very, very, very excited to welcome Daniel Everett.
371240	371740	Oops.
388600	391080	OK.
391080	393800	So I'll walk around a bit.
393800	397120	I come to Harvard now about once a week, twice a week,
397120	399960	because I'm writing this biography of Charles Sanders
399960	405320	Pierce, who graduated from Harvard in 1859.
405320	407240	When he was going here as a student,
407240	410440	his home set where Seaver Hall currently sits.
410440	412960	Those of you who are familiar with Harvard Yard.
412960	415720	And the person who designed that hall,
415720	420240	H.R. Richardson, was a fellow student of Peirce's
420240	421840	in the 1859 class.
421840	423680	There were eight of them.
423680	427920	And Peirce wrote little summaries of each of them,
427920	431560	said Richardson wasn't very smart.
431560	434920	And he also talked about Strong Vincent, a great American
434920	437800	Civil War hero who died in Gettysburg,
437800	440360	saying that he was a bit flashy and also dull.
440360	442960	Peirce thought everybody was dull.
442960	447160	But he was the first summa cum laude in chemistry
447160	448040	from Harvard.
448040	452480	And he was a geophysicist for 31 years for the US government.
452480	455840	He was an astronomer at Harvard and is mainly
455840	459600	known as a mathematician, logician, and philosopher.
459600	461440	So that's very different from this work,
461440	464720	although you'll see that Peirce is implicated
464720	468000	in the evolution of human language.
468000	471560	So I want to thank several people.
471560	472840	And you can see their names.
472840	476200	So now we'll go to something else.
476200	477360	Not that grateful.
477360	480280	Language is a biocultural behavior.
480280	484600	So language is a biocultural complex.
484600	487000	And thus, research into its origins
487000	490120	is necessarily interdisciplinary.
490120	492160	And so if you're an archaeologist,
492160	495800	you're not going to find out by yourself how language came
495800	498200	about, and you're not going to do that if you're a linguist.
498200	501600	So it requires a lot of people working together.
501600	505120	And I started on this project by myself,
505120	507280	but have been working quite a bit with archaeologists,
507280	511040	in particular Larry Barham from the University of Liverpool,
511040	513760	whose specialty is Homo erectus.
513760	517560	There are also a lot of different ideas
517560	518760	about what language is.
518760	521240	I'll tell you the right one in a bit.
521240	524200	But language requires to understand
524200	525280	the evolution of language.
525280	528000	We need some archaeology, linguistics, and field
528000	529880	research on contemporary languages,
529880	531600	semiotics.
531600	532760	That's where Peirce comes in.
532760	535600	Comparative biology, philosophy, cognitive science,
535600	539000	paleo-neuroscience, neuroscience, evolutionary theory,
539000	540040	and genetics.
540040	543560	So it is quite a daunting task for anyone
543560	548240	to even try to summarize the research that's going on there.
548240	550280	So we could ask the first question we might ask is,
550280	551000	what is language?
551000	554000	What is it that we think evolved?
554000	557000	And one view is that language is a grammar,
557000	560760	is a set of sentences described by a recursive grammar.
560800	565920	That's a very popular definition of it among linguists.
565920	567680	And or the other idea, and the one
567680	569600	I'm going to urge upon you this evening,
569600	573960	is that language is the transfer of information by symbols.
573960	578280	So there is no firm cutoff between humans and other species.
578280	580880	Humans are better at communication by language
580880	582480	than other species are, but it's not
582480	587960	something that is found exclusively in humans.
587960	590240	But I'll try to make that clear.
590280	591720	Who has language?
591720	593560	Well, everything communicates.
593560	598640	If you follow Purse's work, the entire universe is a sign.
598640	600480	Everything is communication.
600480	601440	Minerals communicate.
601440	603960	The trees right now will start communicating
603960	605680	with the environment the shorter days
605680	607600	and start to grow their leaves back.
607600	609560	So everything communicates.
609560	611000	But not everything has language.
611000	613640	Only humans really appear to have language.
613640	616880	And when we talk about other species,
616880	619960	we have to be very careful about what we say about them.
620000	622120	Relative to humans, to get this right.
622120	625520	So communication, again, is the transfer of information
625520	629800	by signs, which I'll make clearer as we go along.
629800	634400	And language is the transfer of information by symbols.
634400	639680	Symbols that are open-ended and created by people.
639680	641160	Well, they could be created by anybody,
641160	643880	but they just happen to be created by people.
643880	646240	And so there are three types of signs
646240	648440	that are very important to the story.
648440	650320	And two of those are found throughout nature.
650320	651640	Icons and indexes.
651640	653880	An icon is something that resembles something else.
653880	656000	There's some sort of correspondence,
656000	658280	you know, a reflection in the water,
658280	665960	or a certain kind of feeling that you get
665960	669720	that corresponds to a particular musical event.
669720	673400	An index is a sign that's connected physically
673400	674840	to what it represents.
674840	678240	So smoke is connected physically to fire.
678240	679520	That's an index of fire.
679520	683440	A footprint is an index of the creature that made it.
683440	686840	Symbols are signs that refer to objects
686840	690080	by convention, habit, or rule.
690080	691760	And to simplify things, I'm simply
691760	696200	going to say that symbols are conventional signs.
696200	699080	They are things that don't have to mean what they mean.
699080	701360	There's no necessary connection to what they mean.
701360	706520	So dog refers to a canine in English, perro in Spanish,
706520	708400	and cachorro in Portuguese.
708400	712560	Neopai in Pideha, these are just conventional things.
712560	716520	They're just physical forms that are conventional
716520	721120	to refer to meanings that are significant in that culture.
721120	723960	So the threshold to productive symbols
723960	727880	was likely fairly sudden, but the evolution of the platforms
727880	730480	for language and symbols took evolutionary time
730480	732560	and are not limited to Homo sapiens.
732560	734760	They don't just get a creature that one day stands up
734760	736320	and starts talking.
736360	739200	We expect to see a lot of correspondence
739200	744360	and a lot of continuity between our species and other species
744360	746640	when we look at communication.
746640	750760	So we find that birds have particular song
750760	753160	dialects, depending on the geographical area they're
753160	756800	found, even in the same species that dolphins communicate,
756800	761640	that chimpanzees and gorillas have fairly interesting
761640	763080	communication systems.
763080	766300	They're not human language, but they're also not totally
766300	768580	unlike human language.
768580	772260	One view is that the view that language is primarily
772260	777820	a former grammar came about in our species and Homo sapiens
777820	781300	about 100,000 to 200,000 years ago.
781300	784260	The alternative view, which I will talk about tonight,
784260	788260	is that language has existed for about 60,000 generations
788260	789540	or more than a million years.
790540	796700	So another thing to clarify is that speech is secondary.
796700	799380	The sounds that are coming out of my mouth
799380	802180	are just one way to express language.
802180	805220	It can be expressed by color-coded shapes.
805220	807020	It can be expressed by hand signals.
807020	811180	It can be expressed by mouth signals, by sounds.
811180	815100	And you don't need a lot of speech to have language.
815100	816460	After all, think of the computer.
816460	818820	How many speech sounds does a computer
818820	823060	have, individual things that it can recognize?
823060	825180	Well, it has two, one and zero.
825180	829100	And everything that can be said can be said with ones and zeros.
829100	833700	Computers have better memories, in some respects, than we do.
833700	837020	So they can remember and distinguish longer sequences.
837020	839780	So we tend to have more than just two symbols.
839780	842980	Actually, you could have just one symbol and have a language.
843020	848140	Because you could have ah means tree, and ah means by the tree,
848140	851820	and ah means over there by the tree, or something like that.
851820	852860	But that's hard to remember.
852860	855180	So those systems don't tend to do too well.
855180	858020	In fact, I don't know of any languages like that.
858020	859860	The smallest system that I'm aware of
859860	864260	is Pidaha, which has eight consonants if you're a man,
864260	867980	seven consonants if you're a woman, and three vowels.
867980	870900	And it also has two tones, which is something
870900	873260	when we talk about the evolution of speech,
873260	875460	we sometimes forget that there are tone languages
875460	878180	and that people can distinguish words by tones,
878180	879820	rather than just by consonants and vowels.
882500	884300	There's some evidence, some people,
884300	886780	to come to Fitch, for example, as a biologist at the University
886780	891540	of Vienna, thinks that early species of humans
891540	893100	had full speech capabilities.
893100	895700	In fact, he argues that non-human species
895700	898860	have full speech capabilities.
898860	901580	The answer is it doesn't really matter that much
901580	904260	because language is not about speech,
904260	909260	it is about symbols and transfer of information by symbols.
910900	913820	However, so if you talk about the components
913820	915900	of all languages, so every language in the world
915900	918820	has the three vowels, i, a, u.
918820	922100	And I tell you that Pidaha only has three vowels.
922100	924300	If you're a linguist, you can guess that those vowels
924300	927460	are i, a, u, because every language has those vowels.
927460	930100	Those are called the quantal vowels.
930100	931900	They're just the easiest to hear.
933260	934660	In fact, they're so important that,
934660	938180	according to Phil Lieberman, who's son Daniel,
938180	942420	I believe, teaches here, has argued
942420	946020	that the entire evolution of the tongue in the human mouth
946020	948260	is to be able to produce those vowels.
948260	950740	They're that important and they help distinguish
950740	952140	the speech of all languages.
954700	956060	Did they come later?
957060	958980	Well, according to Fitch and others,
958980	961380	they didn't come later, but according to work
961380	966380	by Jeffrey Leitman and Phil Lieberman,
966660	968540	but especially Jeffrey Leitman's work,
969780	973260	there is a rapid evolution in the vocal apparatus
973260	975540	starting about the time of Homo erectus,
975540	980540	which would be explained if that's when language started.
980580	985100	They would need better speech to communicate with language,
985140	989180	although you don't have to make clear sounds to have language.
989180	993340	You can have garbled speech and it's still language.
993340	995500	It's like getting a Model T Ford.
995500	996820	Is that a car?
996820	997660	Yes, it is.
997660	999300	It's not a Ferrari, but it's a Model T.
999300	1001020	So we didn't start off necessarily
1001020	1003180	with the full capabilities that we have today,
1003180	1006980	but we had enough speech to get by.
1006980	1008780	There are a lot of external conditions
1008780	1011820	on human speech evolution.
1011820	1016460	So work by Damian Blasey and Sean Rogers and Caleb Everett,
1016460	1020580	who not coincidentally shares my name,
1020580	1023460	all argue for exocentric factors
1023460	1026180	affecting the evolution of speech.
1026180	1028460	Anyway, our hero is Homo erectus.
1028460	1031420	I'm sure that he or she looked just like this.
1031420	1036420	I was very, I'm always intrigued to discover new findings
1036940	1039260	in the literature about the accomplishments
1039260	1041780	of Homo erectus because we tend
1041780	1043740	to really downgrade Homo erectus.
1043740	1045100	You know, if you remember, if you're old enough
1045100	1049780	to remember the American comedian Rodney Dangerfield,
1049780	1052980	you know his line is, I don't get no respect.
1052980	1055740	That's how I feel about Homo erectus at times.
1057700	1059900	Everybody's impressed with the latest artwork
1059900	1062700	from Neanderthals or Sapiens,
1062700	1065740	but erectus is really where it all started.
1065780	1070540	And in fact, in recent study published,
1071940	1074940	there's been some news about it in the last couple of days,
1074940	1077140	it was discovered that Homo sapiens,
1077140	1082140	modern Homo sapiens in Africa have DNA evidence
1082380	1087380	that shows that they interbred with a Homo species
1087500	1091700	that existed prior to the split of Neanderthals and Sapiens.
1091700	1093100	Well, that's Homo erectus.
1094100	1097540	They didn't mate with chimpanzees and gorillas,
1097540	1100500	as far as we know, they had to see a certain amount
1100500	1104140	of similarity between themselves and erectus,
1104140	1107820	almost certainly, and there would have done that.
1108820	1112340	Homo sapiens and erectus co-existed for many years together.
1112340	1116180	In fact, Homo erectus is the most successful species
1116180	1118340	in the history of our genus Homo.
1118340	1120940	So they existed from 1.8 million years ago
1120980	1123020	to about 140,000 years ago,
1123020	1125220	some would say even more recently.
1125220	1126940	They're far more successful than we are,
1126940	1130500	they existed well over a million years longer
1130500	1132780	than Homo sapiens has existed.
1132780	1135500	Their height was between 5'8 and 5'11,
1136500	1138740	so they weren't little Australopithecines,
1138740	1142300	they were big guys, they had big bones,
1142300	1145220	they could have pretty much taken
1145220	1147940	on any Homo sapiens walking around.
1147940	1150300	They were wide-ranging polymorphic species,
1150300	1152700	they had a lot of variation in skull size
1152700	1155060	and in physical strength,
1156540	1160420	and they arguably did possess a modern vocal apparatus,
1160420	1162220	from what we can tell from the,
1163380	1165780	it's very difficult to find the small little bones
1165780	1168020	that define a modern vocal apparatus,
1168020	1169820	but in recent work there has been discoveries
1169820	1171980	of what appear to be hyoid bones
1171980	1173780	that belong to Homo erectus,
1173780	1176500	which would have meant that they had
1176500	1178940	fairly modern speech capabilities.
1178940	1180660	They were ocean travelers,
1182540	1184980	magnificent tool makers,
1184980	1188380	they invented fire, they started communities.
1188380	1190060	Much of what we take for granted
1190060	1192860	as human accomplishments are human accomplishments,
1192860	1195500	they're just from a non-sapien species of human.
1197220	1199780	So there are gradualist versus saltationist views
1199780	1202340	of language origin, so did language come about gradually
1202340	1204380	or just pop into being?
1204380	1206300	I think it came about gradually,
1206300	1207700	just to set the groundwork.
1209300	1212460	Is language uniquely human or non-unique human set
1212460	1215020	of abilities shared with other animals?
1216260	1220620	Descartes, who was very good mathematician,
1220620	1223020	but an extremely poor philosopher,
1224340	1227260	Charles Sanders Purse in fact has all sorts of sections
1227260	1230660	about why Descartes was a bumbling idiot,
1230660	1234260	but of course Charles thought that about many people,
1234260	1238780	but he severely attacks all of Cartesian philosophy,
1238780	1242180	but one of the interesting distinctions of course
1242180	1245860	is that Descartes felt that only humans had cognition
1245860	1248540	and that other animals were basically meat machines.
1248540	1251980	They were just, you didn't need to be kind to animals
1251980	1254140	or worry about them because they had no consciousness,
1254140	1257660	they had no brains, they had brains but no minds
1257660	1261700	because dualism comes from Descartes in modern times.
1262580	1264260	So there's a very different view from Descartes.
1264260	1266500	This is the view that we are just continuous
1266540	1269220	in nature, humans are just animals like others,
1269220	1270980	shouldn't be a shock for people these days,
1270980	1273140	although it is a shock for many linguists
1273140	1274420	to think in those terms.
1275780	1276980	So the evolution of the brain,
1276980	1281940	how big was Homo erectus' brain and what does it matter?
1281940	1285980	Their average brain size was about 950 cc's
1285980	1290900	whereas Neanderthals brain was about 1,400 cc's
1290900	1295900	and a modern human's brain is about 1,250 to 1,300 cc's
1296660	1300060	although many modern European females
1300060	1304780	have brains in the size range of Homo erectus,
1304780	1309780	about 950 cc's and as people who study the brain
1310100	1314700	have come to realize size doesn't matter so much.
1315700	1318820	But you can find, you can see the ranges here,
1318820	1322100	the circle is where we find most of the Homo erectus'
1322100	1324820	brain sizes but you also find some sapiens in there
1324820	1327340	and Neanderthals and as you go out towards
1327340	1330340	the upper edges of the chart you do start to get
1330340	1333860	into fairly sapiens exclusive territory
1333860	1337140	but just remembering that we don't fully understand
1337140	1339060	the brain that's putting it mildly
1339060	1342460	and so the main thing that matters
1342460	1343820	is the organization of the brain
1343820	1346300	and that's extremely difficult to tell with fossils
1346300	1348300	how their brains were organized.
1348300	1351820	So human ancestry is represented in this chart
1351820	1356580	with erectus at the bottom, maybe Floresiensis
1356580	1359740	who was from the islands of Flores,
1359740	1362540	this sometimes called the hobbit little creature
1362540	1366100	who was over there, according to some linguists
1366100	1367980	there are still stories about them told
1367980	1371100	by the indigenous peoples, I don't think that's probably
1371100	1373500	right but they do have stories about little creatures
1373500	1375540	running around through the jungles.
1375540	1380540	But from erectus came all the other creatures
1381020	1385100	that are related to us, all the other 20 or so species
1385100	1388940	of Homo but erectus was the first.
1388940	1391500	Now where does Charles Sanders' purse come in?
1393060	1395540	He was by the way banned from Harvard
1395540	1397620	so it's really interesting that his papers
1397620	1399300	are here at Harvard then one has to come here
1399300	1403860	to study purse because Charles Elliot
1403860	1406140	who was president at the time didn't want him on campus
1406140	1411140	because he was seen coming out of a hotel
1411540	1414220	with a woman who wasn't his wife so he lost his job
1414220	1418860	at Johns Hopkins University and that was the only job
1418860	1420700	he ever had in academics and he was banned
1420700	1422620	from the Harvard campus even though his brother
1422620	1424820	was the dean of mathematics and his father
1424820	1427740	had been professor of mathematics for 50 years here anyway.
1428820	1431900	So he was the one who invented for the very first time,
1431900	1434980	first and second order logic.
1434980	1437740	That's credit is often given to Gottlieb Frege
1437740	1441460	but in fact, purse had it worked out in some ways
1441460	1444460	before Frege and independently about the same time.
1444460	1448660	He invented semiotics, the theory of science before Sosir.
1448660	1451460	He invented pragmatism from William James.
1451460	1453220	There's actually an interesting correspondence
1453220	1455040	between purse and James.
1455040	1457340	Purse was a member of the National Academy of Sciences
1457340	1460660	and he was explaining to James why he could not nominate him
1460660	1462740	for membership in the National Academy of Sciences
1462740	1464660	because most scientists took James.
1464660	1466540	He said, we consider you a literary man,
1466540	1467980	not a real scientist.
1470140	1474100	But James got famous for the idea of pragmatism
1474100	1476140	although the idea comes from purse.
1476140	1477460	At the time that he was alive,
1477460	1479980	he was considered America's greatest mathematician.
1479980	1482820	The German mathematician Ernest Schroeder wrote him
1482820	1486280	and said that your genius and your reputation
1486280	1489620	shall shine like the sun for eons into the future
1489620	1494260	which clearly was wrong but he was a brilliant
1494340	1495180	mathematician.
1495180	1497820	He made fundamental discoveries in mathematics.
1497820	1502300	He was the first person to link the absolute length
1502300	1504980	of a meter to a wavelength of light for measurements.
1504980	1508100	He took over 20 different places in the globe.
1508100	1512660	His only book he ever wrote was on the physical properties
1512660	1517660	of light, photometric researches and he's the first person
1518020	1520220	to notice that the Milky Way rotated,
1520220	1522420	all sorts of things he did in his spare time.
1522860	1527380	And as I will argue in the biography about purse,
1527380	1529260	he was the inventor of cognitive science
1529260	1532620	as we know it, sort of as we know it today.
1532620	1536420	Anyway, this is purse as a young man here.
1536420	1538900	He was an interesting guy.
1538900	1541420	I'm gonna skip this and go on to culture
1541420	1544580	because culture really is the important thing here.
1544580	1546540	You can't have a language unless you have a culture
1546540	1549100	and you can't have a culture unless you have a language.
1549100	1552180	They're symbiotically related.
1552180	1555960	Each determines or constrains and leads to the conditions
1555960	1557340	to develop the other.
1557340	1560420	So in my definition, culture is an abstract network,
1560420	1562820	shaping and connecting social roles,
1562820	1565260	hierarchically structured knowledge domains
1565260	1566900	and ranked values.
1566900	1569420	So ranked values are very important to culture.
1569420	1570900	So it's not enough to know that people
1570900	1571740	have the same values.
1571740	1573660	So for example, if you're French,
1573660	1576260	you might think that good food is very important
1576260	1579580	and that being in good shape is also very important.
1579580	1582460	And if you're from, say, Houston, Texas,
1582460	1584380	you may believe the same things.
1584380	1587460	But if you think that good food is more important
1587460	1589780	than being in shape, you'll look one way.
1589780	1592300	And if you think that being in shape is more important
1592300	1594780	than good food, you'll look another way.
1594780	1598860	So the value rankings are as important or more important
1598860	1601140	than the actual values themselves.
1601140	1602740	Culture is always shifting.
1602740	1610380	So universal grammar is a very popular term.
1610380	1613740	It was made popular in modern times by Noam Chomsky.
1613740	1616660	Although the term goes back to the 12th century,
1616660	1618580	grammarians known as the modesty.
1618580	1621820	And in the US, the first person to ever talk about universal
1621820	1625380	grammar was Charles Sanders Purse.
1625380	1630780	His view of grammar was both he and Chomsky, interestingly
1630780	1635020	enough, felt that recursion, I can
1635020	1636780	talk about recursion separately, but anyway, they thought
1636780	1640020	that recursion was the basis of grammar.
1640020	1644060	But for Purse, it was meaning, recursive meanings, not forms,
1644060	1645140	not the sentences.
1645140	1648660	But the way that, so for example, if I say bachelor,
1648660	1653100	I have to interpret that in terms of, say, unmarried man.
1653100	1655780	And I interpret unmarried in terms of other symbols.
1655780	1658260	And I interpret man in terms of other symbols
1658260	1662020	so that every symbol starts us to a recursive chain that
1662020	1664340	has no end.
1664340	1665380	Everything is connected.
1665380	1667940	And to understand one thing, we have to understand a great
1667940	1668980	deal of culture.
1671420	1676060	So the difference is for Purse universal grammar followed
1676060	1678180	from logical principles.
1678180	1681660	There was nothing necessarily genetic about it.
1681660	1683740	It simply followed from logical principles.
1683740	1686620	If you had symbols, they were subject to certain logical
1686620	1689140	constraints, and those would affect the form of the
1689140	1691540	language.
1691540	1695060	Whereas the second version of universal grammar, Chomsky's
1695060	1700220	is that not only is human biology responsible for
1700220	1704620	underwriting human linguistic capacity, but the genes are,
1704620	1706580	there are specific genes linked to language.
1709260	1712860	So those are very different views of universal grammar.
1712860	1715260	So now let's move on to tools.
1715300	1718260	Tools turn out to be a very important part of reasoning
1718260	1721460	about the origins of human language.
1721460	1725420	Tools are individual devices or processes that meet perceived
1725420	1728900	needs of individuals and communities, or a set of
1728900	1731780	devices, processes, and expertise used to harness the
1731780	1734460	properties of a particular material.
1734460	1737540	Full culturally constructed repertoire of knowledge,
1737540	1739940	conventions, devices, and processes.
1739940	1741900	Values are vital at each stage.
1741900	1744540	So tools are really complicated.
1744540	1746740	This is clearly a complicated tool.
1746740	1747980	But so is a shovel.
1747980	1753980	A shovel has a specific kind of function, and if you make a
1753980	1757820	shovel out of rubber, it won't work very well.
1757820	1761300	So there's a whole lot of things that have to go into a tool
1761300	1765340	as simple as a shovel or a knife to make it be what it is.
1765340	1769100	And it starts to take on meaning features that go
1769100	1771060	beyond its function.
1771100	1774820	Human technology enmeshes the material with the ideational.
1774820	1780540	We have ideas, and they're manifested materially.
1780540	1783900	Tools involve social constructivism.
1783900	1786900	Tools become symbols as they emerge from the values,
1786900	1789060	knowledge, structures, and social roles of a particular
1789060	1790140	culture.
1790140	1793380	Symbolism in erectus tools is therefore crucial evidence.
1793380	1796620	So that's one thing we really need to look for in addition
1796620	1799300	to the other accomplishments of erectus.
1799300	1802540	Now, it's true that other species have tools.
1802540	1807460	But other species' tools tend to be opportunistic.
1807460	1809500	And one of the interesting things, for example, about
1809500	1812060	erectus is that they took very good care of their tools.
1812060	1813020	They colored their tools.
1813020	1815660	They carried their tools with them over long distances.
1815660	1817500	They planned ahead.
1817500	1820420	No other species is known to do that.
1820420	1823620	Although it's a good Darwinian, I wouldn't want to say that
1823620	1825740	no other species could, you know, I wouldn't want to
1825740	1827300	predict what no other species could do.
1827300	1829540	Because every time somebody tries to do that, we find
1829540	1831820	that they can.
1831820	1834140	Learning of technical skills takes place using a
1834140	1836660	combination of language, gesture, imitation, and
1836660	1837660	guided intervention.
1837660	1840220	This applies to all erectus, neanderthal, ensus, and
1840220	1841500	sapiens tools.
1841500	1844100	And we'll be getting to that.
1844100	1846980	This is partially based on lab experiments with stone tool
1846980	1847540	users.
1847540	1851020	And my experience in the Amazon, I see this too.
1851020	1855420	So at the many archaeology departments, they have
1855420	1861740	napping labs, K, N, A, P, P, not N, A, P. And they learn to
1861740	1862420	make stone tools.
1862420	1864020	Graduate students learn to make stone tools.
1864020	1865540	And they bruise their hands.
1865540	1866340	They cut their hands.
1866340	1867700	It's really hard.
1867700	1870420	So the simplest form of stone tool is like the older one
1870420	1873260	tools, which we'll see a picture of.
1873260	1875900	Those take a couple of hundred hours very often for
1875900	1879780	students, PhD students, to learn to make accurately.
1879780	1883980	When we get into the more complex tools, it takes a
1883980	1884740	lot longer.
1884740	1888060	And what people have found in these labs is that even the
1888060	1892100	simplest tools, it's very hard to simply show by example how
1892100	1892940	to do it.
1892940	1898580	Language tends to be implicated in this skill
1898580	1899220	acquisition.
1899220	1901380	Now, this could simply be because they're sapiens, right?
1901380	1902180	And sapiens talk.
1902180	1905860	So why not avail yourself of the speech that you have?
1905860	1911500	In the Amazon, I have watched many men teach their sons
1911540	1915180	how to make tools like blowguns and bows and arrows.
1915180	1917940	And a lot of the time is in silence.
1917940	1921340	But then you'll often hear a question and an answer about
1921340	1924140	something that was very difficult to see or a movement
1924140	1926020	that was very quick.
1926020	1932060	So tools take explanation in many cases.
1932060	1935860	So once again, on a sign, a sign refers to an object.
1936260	1941580	So if I have a sign, if I say water, that's the object.
1941580	1944540	And the representation is W-A-T-E-R.
1944540	1946700	And the interpretation that you're going to make is
1946700	1949700	something to drink.
1949700	1953740	So icons, their physical resemblance, correspondence,
1953740	1956540	they don't tend to have much intentionality about them.
1956540	1959660	A reflection in the water is there, whether you intended
1959660	1961500	it to be there or not.
1961500	1964260	But they can last after a reflection.
1964300	1967420	But they can last after someone's not there.
1967420	1973340	So the smell of a footprint can last for quite a while.
1973340	1976820	All animals are able to interpret indexes.
1976820	1978980	In fact, when we talk about animals'
1978980	1982660	interpretation abilities, almost all the time in the
1982660	1985180	experiments when they're talking about animals' learning
1985180	1987660	symbols, in the Persian sense, they're not learning symbols.
1987660	1991740	They're learning indexes and icons, which are very
1991740	1993820	different levels of cognitive
1993820	1997580	accomplishment from symbols.
1997580	1999620	And so symbols are the final ones.
1999620	2001460	And these are the properties that are important for us.
2001460	2002780	No symbols, no language.
2002780	2004420	They involve displacement.
2004420	2006660	The thing that we're talking about doesn't actually have
2006660	2007740	to be there.
2007740	2010180	I can say water and hold this up, or I can say water
2010180	2010820	without it there.
2010820	2012460	And you still know what I'm talking about, that the
2012460	2015460	object doesn't actually have to be there.
2015460	2016900	Indexes last a long time.
2016900	2020140	These footprints are about 3.7 million years old, found by
2020140	2024820	Mary Leakey in, they're called the Laetoli footprints.
2024820	2027820	And if you follow them out, you can see that it's a large
2027820	2031660	Australopithesis probably, Australopithecus walking with
2031660	2033780	a small one, and they walk, and they turn and look at
2033780	2035980	something, and then they walk on.
2035980	2039620	And it rained after they had walked by, and this is volcanic
2039620	2041820	ash that hardened like concrete and left their
2041820	2043620	footprints there.
2043620	2046460	This is Australopithecus africanus.
2046460	2049420	And as far as we can tell, they're the first creature to
2049420	2051620	ever preserve an icon.
2051620	2056980	So they're starting to look at things and contemplate, I
2056980	2058460	don't think that's too strong a word,
2058460	2059740	contemplate the similarities.
2059740	2063740	So this stone, which is about 3 million years old, is called
2063740	2065140	the Makapansgat pebble.
2065140	2068860	It was found in a cave in South Africa, and it's unlike
2068860	2073780	the material that the other stones in the cave were from.
2073780	2079180	And if you look at it, it has an interesting characteristic.
2079180	2081900	It looks like a smiley face.
2081900	2085740	And this thing is about 3 inches by 2 inches, so it's too
2085740	2088780	big to have gotten caught between their toes and carried
2088780	2090900	up there coincidentally.
2090900	2093540	This seems to be something that Australopithecus and
2093540	2096420	Australopithecus found interesting and carried up to
2096420	2101140	the cave with no particular functional role other than it
2101140	2104100	looked like a face.
2104100	2107300	Australopithecines also made tools.
2107340	2111540	They're tools about 3.3 million years old, found in
2111540	2112300	different places.
2112300	2117340	They're the Oldowan tools discovered initially by the
2117340	2120220	Leakey family.
2120220	2122740	Icons are all over the place.
2122740	2126180	In addition to seeing icons in nature, we have them in
2126180	2128420	churches, and here are tools that have been actually made
2128420	2133300	into icons and symbols, both.
2133300	2136420	And from symbols to grammar, so how complex does a
2136420	2137300	grammar have to be?
2137300	2140340	Everybody will agree, every linguist will agree that you
2140340	2144900	can't have a language until you have a grammar.
2144900	2147220	But how complex does the grammar have to be?
2147220	2149700	Well, there are a couple of different possibilities.
2149700	2153500	And one of the points that I make in the book is that we
2153500	2155860	find all of these in the world today.
2155860	2160060	So one we could call a G1 grammar, which is just words
2160060	2162220	put in a linear order.
2162260	2166940	And that seems to be the case, for example, in Peta Ha and
2166940	2171100	Riau, which is a language of New Guinea, which is
2171100	2173060	John Saul Mary.
2173060	2175100	So there's no other structure, let's say, in a
2175100	2175820	language like this.
2175820	2180140	There's just those three words, John Saul Mary.
2180140	2185500	A G2 grammar would be like a G1 grammar, but have additional
2185500	2187620	hierarchy or structure into the phrases.
2187620	2194140	So the man you saw yesterday is here, where you saw
2194140	2200180	yesterday as a sentence hierarchically located inside
2200180	2204940	a larger sentence, or you could simply say the very big
2204940	2207220	ball rolled down the hill.
2207220	2208860	There you start to get more structure.
2208860	2211660	It's not simply linear order of words.
2211660	2214980	A G3 grammar has both recursion and hierarchy.
2214980	2216300	So what is recursion?
2216300	2219260	It's the ability to put one thing inside another of the
2219260	2221020	same type and just keep doing it.
2221020	2228340	So the man who is here said that Bill said that Mary said
2228340	2232180	that Peter said that John bought a house.
2232180	2234180	When you start to get structures like that so that
2234180	2237340	you can say there's no longer a sentence in a language, then
2237340	2239140	recursion is the best way to handle that.
2239140	2242180	And recursion is communicatively very useful.
2242180	2244260	You can pack a lot more information in a
2244260	2247340	sentence with recursion.
2247340	2250740	But I've argued that although recursion can be found in any
2250740	2253980	language, it's not a necessary component of all languages.
2253980	2256140	And in fact, there are good reasons why some
2256140	2257500	languages would avoid it.
2259940	2261820	So erectus had icons.
2261820	2263500	We know that they carry things around.
2263500	2266940	They didn't carry around smiley faces that we know of, but
2266940	2271300	they did carry around phallic symbols like this cuttlefish
2271300	2277620	bone that was found in Morocco about 450,000 years ago.
2277620	2282980	And erectus also started making quite complex tools.
2282980	2287460	So there are three grades of tools in the paleolithic,
2287460	2289460	especially in the lower paleolithic.
2289460	2291940	There are oldivon tools about 3 million years ago.
2291940	2296020	There are achulian tools made as recently as 200,000 years
2296020	2296820	ago.
2296820	2299980	And then finally, there are levelwa tools, which are the
2299980	2304060	most complex tools found in the paleolithic.
2304060	2307180	So these are refined, which means they've been thinned.
2307180	2312140	These take quite a bit of effort and skill to function.
2312140	2314700	And they have various parts to them.
2314700	2317580	You don't just start off banging two rocks together to
2317580	2318260	get one of those.
2318260	2319780	You have to have a plan.
2319780	2322620	There are certain things that have to be cut out of the tool.
2322620	2327100	It has to have a certain shape to be functional.
2327100	2329220	So when erectus started working on tools, they might
2329260	2330700	start with a large piece of rock.
2330700	2333900	And out of that, they had to break out the pieces that
2333900	2337220	they needed to get the kind of functional tool.
2337220	2342780	And they make them all pretty much the same to work for them.
2342780	2345140	Erectus was the first to come up with a controlled use of
2345140	2346140	fire.
2346140	2349540	The pre-shaping of stone tools, working them before they
2349540	2352980	actually started chiseling out the tools, they used wood and
2352980	2354580	bone tools as well.
2354580	2357180	And we think they might have also used hafted tools.
2357180	2359820	And hafted tools are quite important because that's when
2359820	2363140	you tie a handle on that shows a lot of functional
2363140	2364500	improvement over others.
2364500	2368020	And it shows a lot of foresight and planning.
2368020	2375620	So these tools had a great deal of complexity over
2375620	2377420	hundreds of thousands of years.
2377420	2383340	And in recent research in modern-day Ghana, Larry
2383340	2387500	Barham has discovered about 900,000-year-old tools that
2387500	2390820	seem to have been dyed with ochre.
2390820	2394340	That's a significant finding because dyeing tools shows
2394340	2399380	that that's not simply a functional aspect of toolmaking.
2399380	2404340	That is an aspect of toolmaking that shows thought
2404340	2407140	that goes above the mere function of the tool.
2407140	2410780	Hafting tools, combinatorial thinking, imagining the
2410780	2414660	future, and likely invented by erectus.
2414660	2416620	It's one of the most significant technological
2416620	2420220	breakthroughs in human toolmaking.
2420220	2423340	And ochre is also very important.
2423340	2426420	And we see things like hand axes.
2426420	2429980	They had a tool kit, not nearly as extensive as an
2429980	2433260	Neanderthal tool kit or as a Homo sapiens tool kit, but as
2433260	2435820	an extensive tool kit.
2435820	2437700	They had hand axes and cleavers.
2437700	2439540	They had picks.
2439580	2441180	And so we see different stages.
2441180	2443980	We should recall the simple stage of Oldowan tools that we
2443980	2447860	saw that Australopithecus had.
2447860	2449500	We see achulian tools.
2449500	2452060	These are already starting to get refined and showing a lot
2452060	2453340	more work.
2453340	2457860	And then we get to the Cadillac of the tools of
2457860	2461420	erectus-level-wa tools.
2461420	2464220	Not everyone agrees that erectus-made-level-wa tools.
2464900	2471900	Some are dated as early as 625,000 BC.
2471900	2473900	But not everyone agrees with those dates.
2473900	2478980	The dates that do have the widest agreement are about
2478980	2482740	300,000 years ago.
2482740	2484900	That would mean that they could have been used by
2484900	2487420	Neanderthals or sapiens or erectus.
2487420	2490740	So it's difficult to limit them exclusively to erectus.
2490740	2493820	However, a million years ago, we see larger tools that are
2493860	2497300	made with the same way that level-wa tools are made.
2497300	2503220	Level-wa tools require a lot of hammer work before the
2503220	2506900	final stage, which is lifting the core out of the larger
2506900	2507780	tool.
2507780	2511700	And that takes a lot of planning, a lot of discussion,
2511700	2514020	or a lot of skill.
2514020	2518860	And many of the people who study the tools, a fairly wide
2518860	2522980	consensus, is that level-wa tools can't be learned by
2522980	2524020	imitation alone.
2524020	2527620	There has to be linguistic instruction when we get to
2527620	2529740	this level of tool complexity.
2529740	2534620	And these tools were, in fact, found as early as a million
2534620	2538380	years ago tools that were made by the same process.
2538380	2540820	Not everyone would call them by the same name, but they
2540820	2542940	were made by the same process.
2542940	2545460	So every tool that was made had to have various
2545460	2546540	functional features.
2546540	2551020	So if we find tools that have nothing but functional
2551020	2555220	features, it's difficult to see anything symbolic in that.
2555220	2558820	We can say of any tool that it's an index of the task to
2558820	2562100	be performed, it's an icon of other tools.
2562100	2564580	You have one tool as a model to make another tool.
2564580	2571300	So it does represent a growth in signification.
2571300	2573420	But to get to the level of symbols, we need to see
2573420	2576500	things that aren't simply part of the function.
2576500	2580020	And we start to see some of this at the end of the
2580020	2580980	Acheulean age.
2580980	2586020	We see tools that are made a little bit more elaborately
2586020	2587140	than they need to be made.
2587140	2590940	They're painted, they're dyed.
2590940	2593940	And in fact, when Larry and I were working on some tools
2593940	2599180	that he had just brought back from Africa this past summer,
2599180	2603500	another expert on erectus tools walked into his lab at
2603500	2607020	Liverpool and said, oh, those are from East Africa.
2607020	2612620	Because apparently East African and West African erectus
2612620	2615540	designed their tools in different ways.
2615540	2618540	So the design of the tools was representative of the group
2618540	2619900	that they came from.
2619900	2623940	They indicated robustness.
2623940	2626540	One of the earliest ideas when they started to find these
2626540	2630300	non-functional aspects of erectus tools was that it was
2630300	2633660	men showing off for women, making the tools to show that
2633660	2634740	they were better tool makers.
2634740	2636580	But of course, we have no idea whether it was men who made
2636580	2638660	the tools or women who made the tools.
2638660	2639500	So we don't know.
2639500	2641380	There was somebody who was probably showing off, but we
2641380	2642940	don't know who was showing off.
2642940	2646860	But then we find really interesting things about
2646860	2651460	erectus that are difficult to explain.
2651460	2656620	And we find that, so this shell is 750,000 years old.
2656620	2660140	And the markings on this shell were done in Java by a
2660140	2665380	homo erectus using a shark tooth on this large shell.
2665380	2668020	And the marks were made without ever picking up the shark
2668020	2672340	tooth, their constant continuous representation.
2672340	2674740	And we start to see a lot of this kind of thing with
2674740	2679100	erectus, this kind of attempt to represent things such as
2679100	2679980	this rock.
2679980	2683580	We find these geometric shapes that erectus is starting to
2683580	2687340	carve into shells and into tools so that we realize that
2687340	2690900	erectus is starting to see things beyond their mere
2690900	2692260	functionality.
2692300	2697860	And then about 250,000 years ago, we find this Venus of
2697860	2701980	Barakat Ram, which is in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem,
2701980	2708500	which has got red ochre on it, partially formed by humans,
2708500	2710940	partially formed by nature.
2710940	2714460	But it's the first real artwork that we know about.
2714460	2716300	There are others about the same time.
2716300	2719460	And it does seem to have been made by erectus.
2719460	2724220	So erectus tools, they have symbolic and social components.
2724220	2726220	They go beyond the functionally necessary.
2726220	2727220	They go into style.
2727220	2729460	They represent one tradition over another.
2729460	2732300	They're beyond icons and indexes.
2732300	2735740	They're simultaneously indexes of task, icons of other
2735740	2737980	tools, and symbols of the values and labor of the
2737980	2740540	community.
2740540	2744300	Symbols in linear order simply turn out to be language.
2744300	2747780	As soon as you can start symbolizing things, you have
2747780	2750660	the ingredients that are necessary for language.
2750660	2755220	So if they had language, what other things did they do that
2755220	2757140	might have shown that they had language?
2757140	2761540	So the tools show us that they had the ability to symbolize
2761540	2764180	and this would have been a cognitive
2764180	2765900	breakthrough for language.
2765900	2768180	But is there any other evidence?
2768180	2769780	Well, it turns out that there are.
2769780	2772180	But let's talk about how you get to modern languages from
2772180	2773380	just a few symbols.
2773380	2776060	Most things are enhancements.
2776100	2777300	So we add things.
2777300	2780740	So you have language systems that decide what they're
2780740	2781540	going to represent.
2781540	2783020	What is it that you want to talk about?
2783020	2786460	So among the pita ha, for example, there are no numbers.
2786460	2787460	There are no color words.
2787460	2788900	They don't have the number one.
2788900	2791980	Does this mean that they're cognitively deficient?
2791980	2794620	Well, they also don't have golf clubs.
2794620	2796340	There are a lot of things they don't have and a lot of
2796340	2797220	things we don't have.
2797220	2801900	How many men in here know how to make a good bow and arrow?
2801900	2804020	They produce what their culture needs.
2804020	2805740	Their culture doesn't need numbers.
2805740	2807740	They don't have numbers.
2807740	2810180	And this has been verified with a lot of experiments over
2810180	2812060	the years.
2812060	2816220	So they also don't represent tense, but they don't have
2816220	2818380	past tense or present tense or future tense.
2818380	2822220	But they have a lot of ways of distinguishing different
2822220	2825260	perspectives on how an action takes place, whether it took
2825260	2827620	place at a certain height, whether it took place near
2827620	2828740	the river.
2828740	2830660	So they build into their verbs.
2830660	2834380	How many verb forms does English have?
2834380	2835940	It's pretty poor.
2835940	2838180	Five, sing, sing, sung, singing, sings.
2838180	2838660	That's it.
2838660	2842820	You've exhausted the entire word grammar of English with
2842820	2843660	those.
2843660	2846980	But if you go on to Spanish or Portuguese, you'll get 30 to
2846980	2849060	50 types of verbs.
2849060	2854100	But in Pida ha, since there are 16 suffixes possible, you
2854100	2857900	have two to the 16 possible verb forms, which is about
2857900	2860260	65,000 verb forms.
2860260	2863060	So their grammar is not like ours.
2863060	2867140	It has very complex verbs, but simple in other ways
2867140	2869740	compared to us.
2869740	2872620	It's what a culture decides to represent that starts to work
2872620	2875100	its way into the language.
2875100	2878580	Conceptual systems, how do we interpret these things?
2878580	2880940	Do we interpret these things strictly based on the symbols
2880940	2881420	we see?
2881420	2885900	Do we interpret them based on other cultural nuances?
2885900	2888260	And these all start to form part of the language and enter
2888260	2889780	the language in different ways.
2889820	2893420	Linguistic systems will have different rules, different
2893420	2896300	structures, different constraints.
2896300	2901140	So this shows that language has at least these major
2901140	2904300	components, the objects, the ways they're interpreted, and
2904300	2906340	the forms that we choose to represent them in.
2906340	2907500	And languages differ a lot.
2907500	2910500	So if I say yesterday, what did John give to Mary in the
2910500	2913380	library, there's intonation.
2913380	2918940	My pitch is modulated, depending on whether it's a
2918940	2921220	question or a statement.
2921220	2923500	And these are add-ons to make things clear.
2923500	2926740	It's not necessary to have this intuition to distinguish
2926740	2930700	questions from statements, but it is very, very useful.
2930700	2933780	In Piedahá, like many of the world's languages, probably
2933780	2936780	close to half of the world's languages, such as Chinese and
2936780	2938780	Korean and others, the language is tonal.
2938780	2942460	So the word for ear in Piedahá is awe.
2942460	2945180	And the word for foreigner is awe.
2945180	2947180	And the word for skin is awe.
2947180	2949860	And the word for Brazilian shell is awe.
2949860	2953460	And the word for hand is awe.
2953460	2961300	So if I whistled it, and those are all very important in
2961300	2961660	Piedahá.
2961660	2964540	So you've got to be able to hear those tonal distinctions.
2964540	2967620	But obviously, tone's not necessary, because we don't
2967620	2968380	have it in English.
2968380	2971700	And although English may not be as attractive sounding as
2971700	2974860	Piedahá, it still seems to work.
2974860	2976900	So there are all sorts of things we can add.
2976900	2979300	Once we get symbols, there are all ways that we can embellish
2979300	2982500	them with sound structures and the kinds of syllables we use,
2982500	2985980	the way we organize things.
2985980	2988740	And then we start to think about how languages
2988740	2990380	represented in the brain.
2990380	2994220	And in the work of Evelina Fedorenko at MIT's Brain and
2994220	2999460	Cognitive Sciences Department, she's found that languages,
2999460	3002420	not at all, found in just one part of the brain, as people
3002420	3004860	thought for many years, but that it's distributed
3004860	3009140	throughout the brain in what she calls a language network.
3009140	3014220	And that this network is fairly similar across all languages
3014220	3016660	and across all people.
3016660	3019140	But it's a lot more complicated than simply saying it's in
3019140	3021900	Broca's area, if you've heard of that area, or
3021900	3023180	Vernike's area.
3023180	3025700	Actually, the interesting thing about Broca's patient is
3025700	3029300	the part of his brain that was damaged was not Broca's area.
3029300	3035820	But simplistic views of where language is found in the brain
3035820	3039500	are being challenged every day by more research.
3039500	3045620	So there are various ways that we enhance grammar in morphemes,
3045620	3049820	our little parts of words, like the 65,000 Piedoha word forms.
3049820	3052500	There are phrases, sentences, paragraphs, discourses,
3052500	3053340	conversations.
3053340	3057780	All of these are important, and they occur naturally over time.
3057780	3061380	The interesting thing about language, although it's very
3061380	3064780	complicated, once we start to look at a finished system, we
3064780	3067660	can see that its components are relatively simple and build up
3067660	3071580	over time, and that the core component to every aspect of
3071580	3074780	the language that's been built up is the symbol.
3074780	3077220	So what else did erectus do?
3077220	3081500	Well, just under two million years ago, they were spread
3081500	3083020	out across the world.
3083020	3086260	That we find them in Beijing, we find them in Iran, we find
3086260	3089260	them in various parts of the world.
3089260	3090180	We find erectus.
3090180	3094780	There were still many in Africa, and so they were traveling.
3094780	3100980	And we find a 790,000-year-old settlement in Israel,
3100980	3103620	Geshe Benoit Yaakov.
3103620	3105860	And in there, we find the controlled use of fire,
3105860	3112420	specialized spaces, various components that show, for
3112420	3116860	example, separate areas of the settlement are used for
3116860	3120300	processing meat, processing fish, processing plant, what
3120300	3122140	seem to be communal areas.
3122140	3127660	So erectus did seem to have the ability to have an
3127660	3128540	organized society.
3128540	3133500	There's evidence that their society was organized.
3133500	3136820	And this is found in this ongoing work in Israel and
3136820	3137580	other places.
3137580	3141100	This is found where the black dot is, is an erectus
3141100	3142380	settlement in Israel.
3142380	3146020	There are a lot of interesting archaic human sites in the
3146020	3148860	Middle East, in Israel, and other places.
3148860	3151220	Because if you're coming out of Africa at the time they were
3151220	3154900	coming out, because the Sahara Desert was actually a lush
3154900	3157980	green forest, you come out, turn right.
3157980	3159460	And it's all you can do.
3159460	3160860	You can't go straight, because that's the ocean.
3160860	3163780	Turn right, and you're in the Middle East.
3163780	3165780	And that's why we find those to be some of the
3165780	3166340	earliest settlements.
3166340	3170300	So here's the excavation in Israel, finding these
3170300	3172740	different aspects of it.
3172740	3179180	There's also good evidence that erectus traveled across
3179180	3183660	distances they could not see across in the ocean.
3183660	3185300	And there are several interesting
3185300	3186500	things to draw from this.
3186500	3189860	First of all, most marine archaeologists argue that you
3189860	3193940	can't have a viable human community without 20 to 40
3193940	3198140	people arriving roughly at the same time in an area.
3198140	3201900	So when we find evidence of viable human culture in
3201900	3206740	places like Flores in Indonesia, so if you look at
3206740	3210700	the island of Flores in Indonesia, the point where
3210700	3214540	erectus would have had to cross is about 28 miles.
3214540	3218100	So it's about the size of the English Channel.
3218100	3220940	You could think, well, people swim the English Channel, and
3220940	3223700	we know that other animals could swim across.
3223700	3229340	But Flores is split off from the rest of what would have
3229340	3233620	been at that time the mainland by the strongest ocean
3233620	3234620	current in the world.
3234620	3237300	It's called the Pacific Through Flow.
3237300	3241900	And it was the same current back then, 750,000 years ago,
3241900	3242620	as far as we can tell.
3242620	3245500	So it was too difficult for a human to swim
3245500	3246380	across that current.
3246380	3249340	In fact, if you just put a raft in the water or just put a
3249340	3253100	log in the water and start off, you're going to get
3253100	3254420	washed out to sea.
3254420	3255700	You're not going to make it to Flores.
3255700	3257100	The current is too strong.
3257100	3260700	So for humans who have gotten there, it's highly likely
3260700	3263940	that they had boat-building capability.
3263940	3268180	In fact, an archaeologist in Australia, Robert Bednarik,
3268180	3274940	has built boats using erectus tools, etchulian tools, and
3274940	3278700	level-wa tools, and shown that he can build boats that
3278700	3281380	can get there in that period of time.
3281380	3284700	The question is, could they have done that without language?
3284700	3289940	And there's an article by a moxplunk evolutionary
3289940	3293500	anthropologist, David Gill, called, how much grammar do
3293500	3295300	you need to build a boat?
3295300	3299300	And he argues that you actually don't need much grammar,
3299300	3301780	but you do need language to be able to build a boat.
3301780	3304340	And so the idea that they could sail, and this is a
3304340	3307860	controversial idea, most things said about the past are
3307860	3311980	controversial, because you can say they got there, and they
3311980	3314220	had to get there in a certain number.
3314220	3316460	But you can't show that they got several places.
3316460	3321020	The ideal thing would be to show them in places where we
3321020	3321500	know.
3321500	3322780	So some people have argued they got
3322780	3325700	across by tsunamis, right?
3325700	3330220	But that sort of defies the physics of tsunamis, which tend
3330220	3332100	to come towards the land.
3332100	3334740	Now there are cases of people who've been found out to see
3334740	3337660	there was a Japanese guy found floating on a roof, I think,
3337660	3341140	after the tsunami that hit Japan a couple of years ago.
3341140	3343900	So it does occasionally happen, but it doesn't seem to be a
3343900	3348380	very productive way of travel, sort of fortuitous.
3348380	3351180	And they did this a lot, even in places where we don't know
3351180	3352780	of tsunamis having hit.
3352780	3355260	So Kotra, the Russian archaeological team, found
3355260	3361580	evidence in Sokotra 1.4 million years ago, which is 150
3361580	3364420	miles from the closest land.
3364420	3367500	We start to see evidence of potential burial.
3367540	3370220	This stone on the right is called Excalibur.
3370220	3374700	It's a colored handaxe of the period, a Julian handaxe, and
3374700	3375940	it was found in a grave.
3375940	3378180	Does that mean it was buried on purpose with them?
3378180	3379740	We start to see evidence of that.
3379740	3383420	It's difficult to say convincingly that it was, but it
3383420	3387100	is interesting that it was a colored handaxe found.
3387100	3389620	Around the time that Neanderthal was starting to
3389620	3393860	appear, the erectus Neanderthal transition period, we
3393860	3398780	find wooden spears that were preserved for almost 400,000
3398780	3402940	years, according to some dating, which would have put them
3402940	3406020	back in the time of erectus.
3406020	3412420	So erectus, about 1.5 million years ago, they start making
3412420	3414700	extremely complicated tools.
3414700	3416700	They start traveling around the world.
3416700	3419900	They start an evolutionary process physical where they
3419900	3423820	start to get more articulate speech, the capacity for
3423820	3425300	more articulate speech.
3425300	3427540	They seem to be mastering boat travel.
3427540	3429820	The ocean was never a barrier to erectus.
3429820	3432180	Anytime there's an ocean barrier, you can expect to
3432180	3434540	find erectus on the other side.
3434540	3437740	They had organized settlements.
3437740	3442340	So all of these tasks imply the likelihood of language.
3442340	3446140	If we look at other species and we see species that are far
3446140	3448780	removed from humans that seem to approximate some sort of
3448780	3453260	linguistic ability, it's hardly surprising that what we
3453300	3455540	would see an even greater ability in these creatures
3455540	3457980	that were so much like us and had almost
3457980	3460580	modern-sized brains.
3460580	3464820	So if it's correct, there is evidence for language.
3464820	3468060	Nobody could say this case has been proven, but it is
3468060	3468820	highly likely.
3468820	3471700	Once we take off the burden of languages looking like
3471700	3474660	modern languages and we realize that a language is the
3474660	3477620	transfer of information by the discovery and use of
3477620	3481020	symbols and elaboration of those symbols over time, then
3481020	3483860	we see a gradual evolution of language and we see
3483860	3487420	evidence of erectus and no reason to withhold the
3487420	3490340	judgment that they had language to account for all the
3490340	3494020	different things that they were able to accomplish in
3494020	3496020	their long history.
3496020	3497620	They were preceded by these guys.
3497620	3502820	These are just the various species of Australopithecines.
3502820	3507060	Nature experimented a lot before it got to us.
3507060	3510860	That could mean that we're the best or it could mean that
3510860	3514820	it doesn't necessarily mean that we're the best.
3514820	3520500	And when we ask where erectus went, just look around.
3520500	3523020	We are erectus.
3523020	3532140	Erectus was the ancestor of Neanderthal, of sapiens, of
3532140	3535980	every other human creature that has existed.
3535980	3538900	They were the smartest creatures the world had ever seen.
3538900	3540340	They were the most widely traveled.
3540340	3543220	They sailed, they built fire, they had settlements.
3543220	3548060	They had strong evidence for symbolism in their tools.
3548060	3551820	It's very difficult to see why we would withhold the
3551820	3556460	judgment that they likely had language.
3556460	3560020	And what they had to have had was more than simply grunts
3560020	3561500	and squeals.
3561500	3564300	They had to have something that was able to communicate
3564300	3567700	actual content about the world around them, the kind of
3567700	3569820	thing that would have been essential and been
3569820	3570740	discovered and symboled.
3570740	3571700	So thank you very much.
3592380	3593940	We have time for a few questions.
3593940	3597180	If anyone wants to raise their hand, I can run this.
3602460	3602700	Hello.
3602700	3604180	Thank you for a nice talk.
3604180	3609980	To my knowledge, what is peculiar to Homo sapiens is
3609980	3615020	the use of actual, what we would today call, artwork,
3615020	3618100	such as was seen, of course, in the stone caves in France
3618100	3621220	and perhaps in Africa earlier.
3621220	3623660	Your talk is the first I've heard where you can say that
3623660	3628820	Homo erectus was actually doing, I don't know if you call it
3628820	3629660	art or not.
3629660	3632060	Of course, today we still don't know what is art and what
3632060	3634660	is not, but that's another matter.
3634660	3638020	But that is one thing that seems to have been peculiar.
3638020	3642020	Even that occurred relatively late in the lifetime of
3642020	3643260	Homo sapiens.
3643260	3646300	Also, I'd be interested to know if you think Homo erectus,
3646300	3649980	not only had learned how to use fire, but had actually
3649980	3651180	learned how to make it.
3651180	3652220	So thank you.
3652220	3654780	Yeah.
3654780	3657100	On fire, the archaeological evidence seems to be that,
3657100	3657980	yes, they could make it.
3657980	3659140	They had controlled use of fire.
3659140	3661260	We find it regularly in their settlements.
3661260	3665540	As far as artwork, this is a red herring that a lot of
3665540	3670340	archaeologists have thought to be somewhat important,
3670340	3672540	because we think of art as symbolic.
3672540	3675180	Actually, some art is symbolic, but a lot of art,
3675180	3677980	especially representational art, is simply iconic.
3677980	3680140	It's a lower level of cognitive
3680140	3681340	development than symbolism.
3681340	3687260	So art is a wonderful accomplishment, but it's not
3687260	3689180	crucial to the linguistic line.
3689180	3691900	It's a sort of red herring to think that if we find
3691900	3695300	painting, it's almost certain that if we find painting,
3695300	3696300	they could talk.
3696300	3699860	But there's no argument from that to that if we don't find
3699860	3701660	painting, they couldn't talk.
3701660	3703460	Painting is just a development.
3703460	3705460	Cultures develop over time.
3705460	3708180	And I know of many cultures that I've done research on in
3708180	3710500	the Amazon that have no art, but they certainly can talk.
3714980	3719860	They don't do anything that is more elaborate in some ways
3719860	3721420	than Homo erectus did.
3721420	3724300	Homo erectus was a hunter-gatherer ban.
3724300	3728820	And so we find many cultures today that live fairly
3728820	3730140	similarly.
3730140	3731180	They're a lot smarter.
3731180	3732100	They have bigger brains.
3732100	3735500	They can think of other things.
3735500	3737940	And if you take them out of the hunter-gatherer ban and raise
3737940	3741100	them in a city, they'll be unrecognizable for anybody else
3741100	3743540	who was raised in the city, which I doubt would be the case
3743540	3744380	for Homo erectus.
3744380	3751220	But at the same time, art doesn't.
3751220	3753580	We want to say that art represents language because
3753580	3755780	it's complicated cultural accomplishment.
3755780	3760620	And it can be symbolic, but it's often simply iconic.
3760620	3763540	So art seems to be a separate cultural development that is
3763540	3765420	off the line of language evolution.
3765420	3769780	And I don't find it convincing to say that art is either here
3769780	3772580	nor there when it comes to language evolution.
3781300	3784180	Tasty.
3784180	3787940	How would you describe the limitations of their language?
3787940	3788780	Of erectus?
3788780	3789620	Yes.
3789620	3796820	So I work with languages that have similar properties.
3796820	3799540	I mean, so in other words, if you think about what the
3799540	3803660	simplest grammar could be, just words in a linear order, I've
3803660	3804860	worked with languages like that.
3804860	3808780	And the fact is they can say anything we can say.
3808780	3812380	The complicated grammars that we have have very useful
3812380	3815980	communicative functions, but they are not necessary to
3815980	3819300	express modern thought or complicated thought.
3819300	3823700	So the fact that somebody, we can say they have a simple
3823700	3826020	grammar doesn't mean they have simple thought.
3826020	3829140	That's another thing that has happened in the history of
3829140	3832740	anthropology and linguistics to somehow think that language
3832740	3834260	is the mirror of thought.
3834260	3835740	And it doesn't have to be.
3835740	3837300	There are a lot of things.
3837300	3840620	For example, I work with hunter-gatherer groups that
3840620	3843460	have very few words for time.
3843460	3845420	Does this mean they don't know there was yesterday?
3845420	3847940	So the Piedohan, for example, have no word for yesterday and
3847940	3849020	no word for tomorrow.
3849020	3851580	And we often find that this or that culture doesn't have a
3851580	3855260	word for X, and so we drive all kinds of conclusions from it.
3855260	3857500	But I don't see any conclusions to draw from that.
3857500	3858940	They can think about those things.
3858940	3861220	Everybody knows they got up yesterday, and they're getting
3861220	3863220	up today, and they'll probably get up tomorrow.
3863220	3865500	But the fact that they choose not to talk about them is a
3865500	3867940	separate kind of cultural value.
3867940	3873460	So I don't find the simplicity of grammar connected very
3873460	3875420	tightly to the complexity of thought.
3879980	3887780	Yeah, if they had symbols, they probably didn't have many
3887780	3888980	limitations.
3888980	3891660	I mean, you could say maybe they had the intelligence of an
3891660	3895060	eight-year-old or a 10-year-old sapient's child.
3895060	3897460	No way to really know that, but let's say they did.
3897460	3899180	Eight-year-olds can talk a lot.
3902140	3908500	I'm curious if we know how easy or difficult it is to know
3908500	3914380	whether a tool that they used was made by them and not
3914380	3915660	created by nature.
3915660	3918340	How can we discern?
3918340	3920780	Well, it's always very hard when you're going back in time to
3920780	3924660	have dating methods that can link them to a species.
3924660	3928180	So if you find a tool that's 600,000 years old, they were
3928180	3930580	the only ones around.
3930580	3933860	Nobody else was around, so they made it.
3933860	3937940	But if you find a tool that was 150,000 years old, well,
3937940	3940580	there were a lot of species of humans around at that time.
3940580	3943580	So narrowing it down to Homo erectus becomes more
3943580	3947820	difficult, but you can guess based on the settlement
3947820	3948260	patterns.
3948260	3950500	But it's difficult to tell with precision once you start
3950500	3954300	getting into the area where other Homo species were
3954300	3955780	existing side by side.
3959620	3961380	Oh, that it was made.
3961380	3966060	Some of the older on tools could have just one rock fell on
3966060	3967300	another, and suddenly you get this.
3967300	3970340	But these Atulian tools, these more complex tools, there's
3970340	3972300	no way they came about by accident.
3972300	3976540	They had to have been designed, planned, and constructed
3976540	3978420	with a great deal of craftsmanship.
3978420	3982700	It takes hundreds of hours, at least 500 hours, from what I've
3982700	3985860	heard, for graduate student in archaeology to be able to make
3985860	3990820	an Atulian handaxe, not to make, that's how long it takes
3990820	3991340	to learn it.
3991340	3992980	They can make them faster after that.
3998300	4004180	I'm curious to know what led to the, I guess, eventual demise
4004180	4008580	of this species given your talk, how successful they have
4008580	4012380	been at traveling and establishing communities
4012380	4014380	all around the world.
4014380	4018820	So I'm just curious, what led to a global end
4018820	4021380	to such a successful run?
4021380	4025020	Yeah, that's a very good question.
4025020	4027060	We're the only ones left standing.
4027100	4029980	So did they die out?
4029980	4031260	Did they become us?
4031260	4033380	One answer is they didn't die.
4033380	4035580	We are them.
4035580	4039740	The other answer is that Homo sapiens is, they're smarter,
4039740	4042940	and one thing we've shown as a species throughout our history
4042940	4047420	is the ability to slaughter other people that look like us.
4047420	4050540	So the fact that the Homo sapiens might have killed them all
4050540	4053700	doesn't seem to have, that doesn't seem to be totally
4053700	4055620	outside the realm of possibility either.
4055620	4058580	So I don't know why they disappeared.
4058580	4060780	And I was asked a similar question
4060780	4062180	when I was giving a talk in Hungary,
4062180	4064140	and I probably should have been more careful.
4064140	4067260	But I said, the Hungarian Jews didn't disappear
4067260	4070780	because they didn't have language.
4070780	4074060	So there are all kinds of reasons that people disappear.
4075060	4086060	Hi.
4086060	4087700	You briefly said at the beginning
4087700	4090020	that the Homo erectus, there was one
4090020	4092060	that they found a hyoid bone in it,
4092060	4095540	so that you're speculating that then they have vocal cords
4095540	4100780	and they could then produce sounds.
4101020	4105420	So are you thinking the later species all had the hyoid bones
4105420	4107540	and could vocalize?
4107540	4109580	We don't really know.
4109580	4112540	Some people, to come to Fitch would believe
4112540	4116460	that we almost certainly had, Homo erectus
4116460	4118980	had this modern speech capability.
4118980	4122860	My point is that it really doesn't matter.
4122860	4125500	Evolving modern speech is a tremendous advantage,
4125500	4127660	but it's not a necessary condition,
4127660	4130180	nor is it a sufficient condition for having language.
4130180	4132900	We can look at other species that seem to have.
4132900	4136140	We listen to a parrot.
4136140	4138380	They can produce human speech sounds fairly well.
4138380	4140660	That's so it shows that it's not a sufficient condition
4140660	4144100	for language, and the fact that erectus might not have had it
4144100	4145980	would show that it's not a necessary condition
4145980	4148980	for language, because we have deaf people today
4148980	4150580	who talk with American sign language
4150580	4152500	and say anything we can say.
4152500	4155980	So language is looking for a physical medium
4155980	4160100	to be transmitted, and that usually, and most efficiently,
4160100	4161140	is human speech.
4161140	4163300	And with quantal vowels and modern speech,
4163300	4165500	we can communicate much more clearly,
4165500	4168500	but it's neither necessary nor sufficient to have language.
4173500	4175020	They could have produced sounds.
4175020	4176380	They might not have been very clear,
4176380	4178700	but the reason that chimpanzees don't talk
4178700	4181020	is not because they can't produce sounds.
4181020	4182180	They produce enough sounds.
4182180	4185540	My point about computers is that any creature that
4185540	4189820	can produce two sounds could talk in principle.
4189860	4195100	My dog makes a lot of sounds, and I understand a lot of them.
4195100	4197060	I'm trying to figure out if any of them are symbols,
4197060	4203100	but they're certainly, she's very articulate in letting
4203100	4206260	me know when it's time to do certain things.
4206260	4211500	So I have mastered a repertoire of her sounds,
4211500	4212500	and she uses them.
4212500	4214340	But that doesn't mean that she, I
4214340	4217820	don't expect her to give me advice about how
4217820	4222260	to find my grandmother in Ancestry.com or something
4222260	4223340	like that.
4223340	4224780	These are cultural accomplishments
4224780	4230060	that require a much greater set of symbols.
4230060	4232620	I think that is about all we have time for.
4232620	4234340	Give another hand to Daniel Everett.
4234340	4235140	Thanks, everybody.
4235140	4236140	Thank you.
