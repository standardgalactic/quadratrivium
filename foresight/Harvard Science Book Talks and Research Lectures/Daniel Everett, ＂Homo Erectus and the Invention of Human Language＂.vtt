00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
Good evening, everyone.

00:02.640 --> 00:04.920
Thanks so much for joining us tonight.

00:04.920 --> 00:08.880
My name is Serena Longo, and on behalf of Harvard Book Store,

00:08.880 --> 00:12.180
the Harvard University Division of Science, the Cabot Science

00:12.180 --> 00:15.100
Library, and Mass Humanities, I'm so

00:15.100 --> 00:17.640
excited to welcome you to our program tonight

00:17.640 --> 00:21.040
with Daniel L. Everett presenting his latest book,

00:21.040 --> 00:26.280
How Language Began, The Story of Humanity's Greatest Invention.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.840
In just a moment, I'll turn things over

00:27.840 --> 00:29.440
to Professor Melissa Franklin, who

00:29.440 --> 00:31.480
will be introducing the program tonight.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.960
But first, I'd like to say a few words about the series

00:33.960 --> 00:37.680
and how you can learn more about our spring season.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.760
The Science Book Talk series features talks

00:39.760 --> 00:41.920
throughout the academic year by authors

00:41.920 --> 00:45.340
of recently published science-related literature.

00:45.340 --> 00:48.120
Just next week, we're very excited to welcome renowned

00:48.120 --> 00:51.480
physicist and Princeton professor Paul J. Steinhart

00:51.480 --> 00:54.520
for his book, The Second Kind of Impossible.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.440
And in April, we'll be joined by a biologist and best-selling

00:57.440 --> 01:02.600
author, Neil Shubin, for his new book, Some Assembly Required.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.640
If you'd like to stay up to date on the series

01:04.640 --> 01:08.360
and our newly posted talks, we have a few options.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.920
Nearly all of our events are filmed and recorded

01:10.920 --> 01:11.800
for the public.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.000
You can access them at the web address,

01:14.000 --> 01:18.880
science.fas.harvard.edu, slash book talks, which I've written

01:18.880 --> 01:21.160
here on the board.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.720
And also, you can find out announcements

01:23.720 --> 01:29.840
about our spring lineup at harvard.com slash science.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.320
And lastly, you can learn about Harvard Bookstore's many other

01:33.320 --> 01:37.080
non-science book talks, which take place nearly every day

01:37.080 --> 01:41.000
and in and around Harvard Square by visiting us at harvard.com

01:41.000 --> 01:44.240
and signing up for our weekly email newsletter.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.640
Tonight's talk will be followed by some time for your questions,

01:47.640 --> 01:50.160
after which we'll have a book signing and refreshments

01:50.160 --> 01:52.320
in the Cabot Science Library.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.080
If you haven't picked up one already,

01:54.080 --> 01:56.880
we have copies of how language began for sale

01:56.880 --> 02:00.520
at the back of the hall and in the Cabot Library as well.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.680
And as always, a few thank yous.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.520
Thanks to our partners here at Harvard who make this series

02:08.520 --> 02:11.280
and, of course, the cheese, all important cheese,

02:11.280 --> 02:13.120
possible at the reception.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.920
And thank you to all of you for being here,

02:15.920 --> 02:18.920
for purchasing books that support an independent bookstore

02:18.920 --> 02:22.040
and for affirming that science matters.

02:22.040 --> 02:24.280
And finally, just a quick reminder, of course,

02:24.280 --> 02:27.720
to silence your cell phones before the talk begins.

02:27.720 --> 02:29.920
And so now I'm so pleased to bring up

02:29.920 --> 02:33.240
Melissa Franklin, Harvard Physics Professor,

02:33.240 --> 02:36.160
and the first woman ever to receive tenure

02:36.160 --> 02:37.960
in the Harvard Physics Department.

02:37.960 --> 02:38.460
Woo!

02:38.460 --> 02:43.800
[? Applause. ?]

02:43.800 --> 02:46.440
Hi, I'm really excited about this talk.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.640
You know, we have a lot of these science book talks,

02:49.640 --> 02:54.160
but they're mostly physics.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.560
I'm really excited to have something really, we're

02:57.560 --> 03:03.960
branching out, and I'm very excited about tonight's talk.

03:03.960 --> 03:07.800
And if any of you have any ideas about more talks

03:07.800 --> 03:10.640
on this subject, I see people here I've never seen before.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.440
So I think it's a different audience than the physics

03:13.440 --> 03:15.800
talks, maybe.

03:15.800 --> 03:16.960
Yes?

03:16.960 --> 03:18.480
Yes, OK.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.680
And so if anybody has any ideas, my name's Franklin at Physics,

03:21.680 --> 03:27.120
just ideas for interesting books in your part of sciencey

03:27.120 --> 03:29.640
things, please let me know.

03:29.640 --> 03:33.520
I want to introduce Daniel Everett, who

03:33.520 --> 03:37.480
has a really interesting past.

03:37.480 --> 03:42.760
And in particular, he started his education

03:42.760 --> 03:45.320
at the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.400
I spent years in Chicago, but I've never

03:47.400 --> 03:48.880
seen the Moody Bible Institute.

03:48.880 --> 03:53.440
It's at La Sal in West Chicago Street.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.920
Nobody's from Chicago.

03:54.920 --> 03:58.000
OK, well, anyway, that's kind of an interesting start.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.680
And from there, he went to Brazil

04:00.680 --> 04:05.400
and got his PhD at the University of Campinas, which

04:05.400 --> 04:10.600
is called Las Campos.

04:10.600 --> 04:16.280
And he did his research also in the South Amazon,

04:16.320 --> 04:20.560
studying the praja in the Amazon basin.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.520
And now, he taught at a lot of different places.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.800
He taught in Pittsburgh at Manchester,

04:25.800 --> 04:30.800
which I think is in England, not Manchester by the sea,

04:30.800 --> 04:33.520
and at Unicamp, which is also in Brazil.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.880
And he's had many, many interesting positions

04:36.880 --> 04:38.360
of leadership.

04:38.360 --> 04:41.880
In the meantime, he has written many books.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.480
The one I like the best, of course,

04:43.480 --> 04:46.560
is Dark Matter of the Mind, because I'm a physicist.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.080
And that's why, initially, I thought

04:48.080 --> 04:55.280
this would be a good talk in this series.

04:55.280 --> 04:59.440
Dark Matter of the Mind, even though you're linguist,

04:59.440 --> 05:01.520
you know what dark matter is.

05:01.520 --> 05:07.080
Yes, of the mind in the culturally articulated

05:07.080 --> 05:07.720
unconscious.

05:07.720 --> 05:11.200
Another one I like is, don't sleep.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.240
There are snakes, life and language

05:13.240 --> 05:17.080
in the Amazonian jungle, or Amazonian jungle.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.960
The one we're talking about today,

05:18.960 --> 05:21.520
how language began, the story of humanity's greatest

05:21.520 --> 05:23.440
invention, and the one that's coming.

05:23.440 --> 05:26.680
I'm also really excited about American Aristotle,

05:26.680 --> 05:30.960
the life and mind of Charles Sanders Pierce.

05:30.960 --> 05:34.640
There are other books, so you're not going to run out.

05:34.640 --> 05:38.600
I mean, if you start now, and you're under 50,

05:38.600 --> 05:42.480
you could get there.

05:42.480 --> 05:47.320
Just to say, if you don't have the length of attention

05:47.320 --> 05:51.120
for books, there's a fantastic New Yorker profile

05:51.120 --> 05:53.880
on Dr. Everett.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.040
So I'm very excited, because I hear

05:56.040 --> 05:57.640
that it's going to be exciting.

05:57.640 --> 06:05.360
Lots of really questions which are probing and questions.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.400
Good probing questions.

06:06.400 --> 06:11.240
So I'm very, very, very excited to welcome Daniel Everett.

06:11.240 --> 06:11.740
Oops.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.080
OK.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.800
So I'll walk around a bit.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.120
I come to Harvard now about once a week, twice a week,

06:37.120 --> 06:39.960
because I'm writing this biography of Charles Sanders

06:39.960 --> 06:45.320
Pierce, who graduated from Harvard in 1859.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.240
When he was going here as a student,

06:47.240 --> 06:50.440
his home set where Seaver Hall currently sits.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.960
Those of you who are familiar with Harvard Yard.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.720
And the person who designed that hall,

06:55.720 --> 07:00.240
H.R. Richardson, was a fellow student of Peirce's

07:00.240 --> 07:01.840
in the 1859 class.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.680
There were eight of them.

07:03.680 --> 07:07.920
And Peirce wrote little summaries of each of them,

07:07.920 --> 07:11.560
said Richardson wasn't very smart.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.920
And he also talked about Strong Vincent, a great American

07:14.920 --> 07:17.800
Civil War hero who died in Gettysburg,

07:17.800 --> 07:20.360
saying that he was a bit flashy and also dull.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.960
Peirce thought everybody was dull.

07:22.960 --> 07:27.160
But he was the first summa cum laude in chemistry

07:27.160 --> 07:28.040
from Harvard.

07:28.040 --> 07:32.480
And he was a geophysicist for 31 years for the US government.

07:32.480 --> 07:35.840
He was an astronomer at Harvard and is mainly

07:35.840 --> 07:39.600
known as a mathematician, logician, and philosopher.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.440
So that's very different from this work,

07:41.440 --> 07:44.720
although you'll see that Peirce is implicated

07:44.720 --> 07:48.000
in the evolution of human language.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.560
So I want to thank several people.

07:51.560 --> 07:52.840
And you can see their names.

07:52.840 --> 07:56.200
So now we'll go to something else.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.360
Not that grateful.

07:57.360 --> 08:00.280
Language is a biocultural behavior.

08:00.280 --> 08:04.600
So language is a biocultural complex.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.000
And thus, research into its origins

08:07.000 --> 08:10.120
is necessarily interdisciplinary.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.160
And so if you're an archaeologist,

08:12.160 --> 08:15.800
you're not going to find out by yourself how language came

08:15.800 --> 08:18.200
about, and you're not going to do that if you're a linguist.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.600
So it requires a lot of people working together.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.120
And I started on this project by myself,

08:25.120 --> 08:27.280
but have been working quite a bit with archaeologists,

08:27.280 --> 08:31.040
in particular Larry Barham from the University of Liverpool,

08:31.040 --> 08:33.760
whose specialty is Homo erectus.

08:33.760 --> 08:37.560
There are also a lot of different ideas

08:37.560 --> 08:38.760
about what language is.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.240
I'll tell you the right one in a bit.

08:41.240 --> 08:44.200
But language requires to understand

08:44.200 --> 08:45.280
the evolution of language.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.000
We need some archaeology, linguistics, and field

08:48.000 --> 08:49.880
research on contemporary languages,

08:49.880 --> 08:51.600
semiotics.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.760
That's where Peirce comes in.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.600
Comparative biology, philosophy, cognitive science,

08:55.600 --> 08:59.000
paleo-neuroscience, neuroscience, evolutionary theory,

08:59.000 --> 09:00.040
and genetics.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.560
So it is quite a daunting task for anyone

09:03.560 --> 09:08.240
to even try to summarize the research that's going on there.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.280
So we could ask the first question we might ask is,

09:10.280 --> 09:11.000
what is language?

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
What is it that we think evolved?

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
And one view is that language is a grammar,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.760
is a set of sentences described by a recursive grammar.

09:20.800 --> 09:25.920
That's a very popular definition of it among linguists.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.680
And or the other idea, and the one

09:27.680 --> 09:29.600
I'm going to urge upon you this evening,

09:29.600 --> 09:33.960
is that language is the transfer of information by symbols.

09:33.960 --> 09:38.280
So there is no firm cutoff between humans and other species.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.880
Humans are better at communication by language

09:40.880 --> 09:42.480
than other species are, but it's not

09:42.480 --> 09:47.960
something that is found exclusively in humans.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.240
But I'll try to make that clear.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.720
Who has language?

09:51.720 --> 09:53.560
Well, everything communicates.

09:53.560 --> 09:58.640
If you follow Purse's work, the entire universe is a sign.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.480
Everything is communication.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.440
Minerals communicate.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.960
The trees right now will start communicating

10:03.960 --> 10:05.680
with the environment the shorter days

10:05.680 --> 10:07.600
and start to grow their leaves back.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.560
So everything communicates.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.000
But not everything has language.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.640
Only humans really appear to have language.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.880
And when we talk about other species,

10:16.880 --> 10:19.960
we have to be very careful about what we say about them.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.120
Relative to humans, to get this right.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.520
So communication, again, is the transfer of information

10:25.520 --> 10:29.800
by signs, which I'll make clearer as we go along.

10:29.800 --> 10:34.400
And language is the transfer of information by symbols.

10:34.400 --> 10:39.680
Symbols that are open-ended and created by people.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.160
Well, they could be created by anybody,

10:41.160 --> 10:43.880
but they just happen to be created by people.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.240
And so there are three types of signs

10:46.240 --> 10:48.440
that are very important to the story.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.320
And two of those are found throughout nature.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.640
Icons and indexes.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.880
An icon is something that resembles something else.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.000
There's some sort of correspondence,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.280
you know, a reflection in the water,

10:58.280 --> 11:05.960
or a certain kind of feeling that you get

11:05.960 --> 11:09.720
that corresponds to a particular musical event.

11:09.720 --> 11:13.400
An index is a sign that's connected physically

11:13.400 --> 11:14.840
to what it represents.

11:14.840 --> 11:18.240
So smoke is connected physically to fire.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.520
That's an index of fire.

11:19.520 --> 11:23.440
A footprint is an index of the creature that made it.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.840
Symbols are signs that refer to objects

11:26.840 --> 11:30.080
by convention, habit, or rule.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.760
And to simplify things, I'm simply

11:31.760 --> 11:36.200
going to say that symbols are conventional signs.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.080
They are things that don't have to mean what they mean.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.360
There's no necessary connection to what they mean.

11:41.360 --> 11:46.520
So dog refers to a canine in English, perro in Spanish,

11:46.520 --> 11:48.400
and cachorro in Portuguese.

11:48.400 --> 11:52.560
Neopai in Pideha, these are just conventional things.

11:52.560 --> 11:56.520
They're just physical forms that are conventional

11:56.520 --> 12:01.120
to refer to meanings that are significant in that culture.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.960
So the threshold to productive symbols

12:03.960 --> 12:07.880
was likely fairly sudden, but the evolution of the platforms

12:07.880 --> 12:10.480
for language and symbols took evolutionary time

12:10.480 --> 12:12.560
and are not limited to Homo sapiens.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.760
They don't just get a creature that one day stands up

12:14.760 --> 12:16.320
and starts talking.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.200
We expect to see a lot of correspondence

12:19.200 --> 12:24.360
and a lot of continuity between our species and other species

12:24.360 --> 12:26.640
when we look at communication.

12:26.640 --> 12:30.760
So we find that birds have particular song

12:30.760 --> 12:33.160
dialects, depending on the geographical area they're

12:33.160 --> 12:36.800
found, even in the same species that dolphins communicate,

12:36.800 --> 12:41.640
that chimpanzees and gorillas have fairly interesting

12:41.640 --> 12:43.080
communication systems.

12:43.080 --> 12:46.300
They're not human language, but they're also not totally

12:46.300 --> 12:48.580
unlike human language.

12:48.580 --> 12:52.260
One view is that the view that language is primarily

12:52.260 --> 12:57.820
a former grammar came about in our species and Homo sapiens

12:57.820 --> 13:01.300
about 100,000 to 200,000 years ago.

13:01.300 --> 13:04.260
The alternative view, which I will talk about tonight,

13:04.260 --> 13:08.260
is that language has existed for about 60,000 generations

13:08.260 --> 13:09.540
or more than a million years.

13:10.540 --> 13:16.700
So another thing to clarify is that speech is secondary.

13:16.700 --> 13:19.380
The sounds that are coming out of my mouth

13:19.380 --> 13:22.180
are just one way to express language.

13:22.180 --> 13:25.220
It can be expressed by color-coded shapes.

13:25.220 --> 13:27.020
It can be expressed by hand signals.

13:27.020 --> 13:31.180
It can be expressed by mouth signals, by sounds.

13:31.180 --> 13:35.100
And you don't need a lot of speech to have language.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.460
After all, think of the computer.

13:36.460 --> 13:38.820
How many speech sounds does a computer

13:38.820 --> 13:43.060
have, individual things that it can recognize?

13:43.060 --> 13:45.180
Well, it has two, one and zero.

13:45.180 --> 13:49.100
And everything that can be said can be said with ones and zeros.

13:49.100 --> 13:53.700
Computers have better memories, in some respects, than we do.

13:53.700 --> 13:57.020
So they can remember and distinguish longer sequences.

13:57.020 --> 13:59.780
So we tend to have more than just two symbols.

13:59.780 --> 14:02.980
Actually, you could have just one symbol and have a language.

14:03.020 --> 14:08.140
Because you could have ah means tree, and ah means by the tree,

14:08.140 --> 14:11.820
and ah means over there by the tree, or something like that.

14:11.820 --> 14:12.860
But that's hard to remember.

14:12.860 --> 14:15.180
So those systems don't tend to do too well.

14:15.180 --> 14:18.020
In fact, I don't know of any languages like that.

14:18.020 --> 14:19.860
The smallest system that I'm aware of

14:19.860 --> 14:24.260
is Pidaha, which has eight consonants if you're a man,

14:24.260 --> 14:27.980
seven consonants if you're a woman, and three vowels.

14:27.980 --> 14:30.900
And it also has two tones, which is something

14:30.900 --> 14:33.260
when we talk about the evolution of speech,

14:33.260 --> 14:35.460
we sometimes forget that there are tone languages

14:35.460 --> 14:38.180
and that people can distinguish words by tones,

14:38.180 --> 14:39.820
rather than just by consonants and vowels.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.300
There's some evidence, some people,

14:44.300 --> 14:46.780
to come to Fitch, for example, as a biologist at the University

14:46.780 --> 14:51.540
of Vienna, thinks that early species of humans

14:51.540 --> 14:53.100
had full speech capabilities.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.700
In fact, he argues that non-human species

14:55.700 --> 14:58.860
have full speech capabilities.

14:58.860 --> 15:01.580
The answer is it doesn't really matter that much

15:01.580 --> 15:04.260
because language is not about speech,

15:04.260 --> 15:09.260
it is about symbols and transfer of information by symbols.

15:10.900 --> 15:13.820
However, so if you talk about the components

15:13.820 --> 15:15.900
of all languages, so every language in the world

15:15.900 --> 15:18.820
has the three vowels, i, a, u.

15:18.820 --> 15:22.100
And I tell you that Pidaha only has three vowels.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.300
If you're a linguist, you can guess that those vowels

15:24.300 --> 15:27.460
are i, a, u, because every language has those vowels.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.100
Those are called the quantal vowels.

15:30.100 --> 15:31.900
They're just the easiest to hear.

15:33.260 --> 15:34.660
In fact, they're so important that,

15:34.660 --> 15:38.180
according to Phil Lieberman, who's son Daniel,

15:38.180 --> 15:42.420
I believe, teaches here, has argued

15:42.420 --> 15:46.020
that the entire evolution of the tongue in the human mouth

15:46.020 --> 15:48.260
is to be able to produce those vowels.

15:48.260 --> 15:50.740
They're that important and they help distinguish

15:50.740 --> 15:52.140
the speech of all languages.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.060
Did they come later?

15:57.060 --> 15:58.980
Well, according to Fitch and others,

15:58.980 --> 16:01.380
they didn't come later, but according to work

16:01.380 --> 16:06.380
by Jeffrey Leitman and Phil Lieberman,

16:06.660 --> 16:08.540
but especially Jeffrey Leitman's work,

16:09.780 --> 16:13.260
there is a rapid evolution in the vocal apparatus

16:13.260 --> 16:15.540
starting about the time of Homo erectus,

16:15.540 --> 16:20.540
which would be explained if that's when language started.

16:20.580 --> 16:25.100
They would need better speech to communicate with language,

16:25.140 --> 16:29.180
although you don't have to make clear sounds to have language.

16:29.180 --> 16:33.340
You can have garbled speech and it's still language.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.500
It's like getting a Model T Ford.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.820
Is that a car?

16:36.820 --> 16:37.660
Yes, it is.

16:37.660 --> 16:39.300
It's not a Ferrari, but it's a Model T.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.020
So we didn't start off necessarily

16:41.020 --> 16:43.180
with the full capabilities that we have today,

16:43.180 --> 16:46.980
but we had enough speech to get by.

16:46.980 --> 16:48.780
There are a lot of external conditions

16:48.780 --> 16:51.820
on human speech evolution.

16:51.820 --> 16:56.460
So work by Damian Blasey and Sean Rogers and Caleb Everett,

16:56.460 --> 17:00.580
who not coincidentally shares my name,

17:00.580 --> 17:03.460
all argue for exocentric factors

17:03.460 --> 17:06.180
affecting the evolution of speech.

17:06.180 --> 17:08.460
Anyway, our hero is Homo erectus.

17:08.460 --> 17:11.420
I'm sure that he or she looked just like this.

17:11.420 --> 17:16.420
I was very, I'm always intrigued to discover new findings

17:16.940 --> 17:19.260
in the literature about the accomplishments

17:19.260 --> 17:21.780
of Homo erectus because we tend

17:21.780 --> 17:23.740
to really downgrade Homo erectus.

17:23.740 --> 17:25.100
You know, if you remember, if you're old enough

17:25.100 --> 17:29.780
to remember the American comedian Rodney Dangerfield,

17:29.780 --> 17:32.980
you know his line is, I don't get no respect.

17:32.980 --> 17:35.740
That's how I feel about Homo erectus at times.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.900
Everybody's impressed with the latest artwork

17:39.900 --> 17:42.700
from Neanderthals or Sapiens,

17:42.700 --> 17:45.740
but erectus is really where it all started.

17:45.780 --> 17:50.540
And in fact, in recent study published,

17:51.940 --> 17:54.940
there's been some news about it in the last couple of days,

17:54.940 --> 17:57.140
it was discovered that Homo sapiens,

17:57.140 --> 18:02.140
modern Homo sapiens in Africa have DNA evidence

18:02.380 --> 18:07.380
that shows that they interbred with a Homo species

18:07.500 --> 18:11.700
that existed prior to the split of Neanderthals and Sapiens.

18:11.700 --> 18:13.100
Well, that's Homo erectus.

18:14.100 --> 18:17.540
They didn't mate with chimpanzees and gorillas,

18:17.540 --> 18:20.500
as far as we know, they had to see a certain amount

18:20.500 --> 18:24.140
of similarity between themselves and erectus,

18:24.140 --> 18:27.820
almost certainly, and there would have done that.

18:28.820 --> 18:32.340
Homo sapiens and erectus co-existed for many years together.

18:32.340 --> 18:36.180
In fact, Homo erectus is the most successful species

18:36.180 --> 18:38.340
in the history of our genus Homo.

18:38.340 --> 18:40.940
So they existed from 1.8 million years ago

18:40.980 --> 18:43.020
to about 140,000 years ago,

18:43.020 --> 18:45.220
some would say even more recently.

18:45.220 --> 18:46.940
They're far more successful than we are,

18:46.940 --> 18:50.500
they existed well over a million years longer

18:50.500 --> 18:52.780
than Homo sapiens has existed.

18:52.780 --> 18:55.500
Their height was between 5'8 and 5'11,

18:56.500 --> 18:58.740
so they weren't little Australopithecines,

18:58.740 --> 19:02.300
they were big guys, they had big bones,

19:02.300 --> 19:05.220
they could have pretty much taken

19:05.220 --> 19:07.940
on any Homo sapiens walking around.

19:07.940 --> 19:10.300
They were wide-ranging polymorphic species,

19:10.300 --> 19:12.700
they had a lot of variation in skull size

19:12.700 --> 19:15.060
and in physical strength,

19:16.540 --> 19:20.420
and they arguably did possess a modern vocal apparatus,

19:20.420 --> 19:22.220
from what we can tell from the,

19:23.380 --> 19:25.780
it's very difficult to find the small little bones

19:25.780 --> 19:28.020
that define a modern vocal apparatus,

19:28.020 --> 19:29.820
but in recent work there has been discoveries

19:29.820 --> 19:31.980
of what appear to be hyoid bones

19:31.980 --> 19:33.780
that belong to Homo erectus,

19:33.780 --> 19:36.500
which would have meant that they had

19:36.500 --> 19:38.940
fairly modern speech capabilities.

19:38.940 --> 19:40.660
They were ocean travelers,

19:42.540 --> 19:44.980
magnificent tool makers,

19:44.980 --> 19:48.380
they invented fire, they started communities.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.060
Much of what we take for granted

19:50.060 --> 19:52.860
as human accomplishments are human accomplishments,

19:52.860 --> 19:55.500
they're just from a non-sapien species of human.

19:57.220 --> 19:59.780
So there are gradualist versus saltationist views

19:59.780 --> 20:02.340
of language origin, so did language come about gradually

20:02.340 --> 20:04.380
or just pop into being?

20:04.380 --> 20:06.300
I think it came about gradually,

20:06.300 --> 20:07.700
just to set the groundwork.

20:09.300 --> 20:12.460
Is language uniquely human or non-unique human set

20:12.460 --> 20:15.020
of abilities shared with other animals?

20:16.260 --> 20:20.620
Descartes, who was very good mathematician,

20:20.620 --> 20:23.020
but an extremely poor philosopher,

20:24.340 --> 20:27.260
Charles Sanders Purse in fact has all sorts of sections

20:27.260 --> 20:30.660
about why Descartes was a bumbling idiot,

20:30.660 --> 20:34.260
but of course Charles thought that about many people,

20:34.260 --> 20:38.780
but he severely attacks all of Cartesian philosophy,

20:38.780 --> 20:42.180
but one of the interesting distinctions of course

20:42.180 --> 20:45.860
is that Descartes felt that only humans had cognition

20:45.860 --> 20:48.540
and that other animals were basically meat machines.

20:48.540 --> 20:51.980
They were just, you didn't need to be kind to animals

20:51.980 --> 20:54.140
or worry about them because they had no consciousness,

20:54.140 --> 20:57.660
they had no brains, they had brains but no minds

20:57.660 --> 21:01.700
because dualism comes from Descartes in modern times.

21:02.580 --> 21:04.260
So there's a very different view from Descartes.

21:04.260 --> 21:06.500
This is the view that we are just continuous

21:06.540 --> 21:09.220
in nature, humans are just animals like others,

21:09.220 --> 21:10.980
shouldn't be a shock for people these days,

21:10.980 --> 21:13.140
although it is a shock for many linguists

21:13.140 --> 21:14.420
to think in those terms.

21:15.780 --> 21:16.980
So the evolution of the brain,

21:16.980 --> 21:21.940
how big was Homo erectus' brain and what does it matter?

21:21.940 --> 21:25.980
Their average brain size was about 950 cc's

21:25.980 --> 21:30.900
whereas Neanderthals brain was about 1,400 cc's

21:30.900 --> 21:35.900
and a modern human's brain is about 1,250 to 1,300 cc's

21:36.660 --> 21:40.060
although many modern European females

21:40.060 --> 21:44.780
have brains in the size range of Homo erectus,

21:44.780 --> 21:49.780
about 950 cc's and as people who study the brain

21:50.100 --> 21:54.700
have come to realize size doesn't matter so much.

21:55.700 --> 21:58.820
But you can find, you can see the ranges here,

21:58.820 --> 22:02.100
the circle is where we find most of the Homo erectus'

22:02.100 --> 22:04.820
brain sizes but you also find some sapiens in there

22:04.820 --> 22:07.340
and Neanderthals and as you go out towards

22:07.340 --> 22:10.340
the upper edges of the chart you do start to get

22:10.340 --> 22:13.860
into fairly sapiens exclusive territory

22:13.860 --> 22:17.140
but just remembering that we don't fully understand

22:17.140 --> 22:19.060
the brain that's putting it mildly

22:19.060 --> 22:22.460
and so the main thing that matters

22:22.460 --> 22:23.820
is the organization of the brain

22:23.820 --> 22:26.300
and that's extremely difficult to tell with fossils

22:26.300 --> 22:28.300
how their brains were organized.

22:28.300 --> 22:31.820
So human ancestry is represented in this chart

22:31.820 --> 22:36.580
with erectus at the bottom, maybe Floresiensis

22:36.580 --> 22:39.740
who was from the islands of Flores,

22:39.740 --> 22:42.540
this sometimes called the hobbit little creature

22:42.540 --> 22:46.100
who was over there, according to some linguists

22:46.100 --> 22:47.980
there are still stories about them told

22:47.980 --> 22:51.100
by the indigenous peoples, I don't think that's probably

22:51.100 --> 22:53.500
right but they do have stories about little creatures

22:53.500 --> 22:55.540
running around through the jungles.

22:55.540 --> 23:00.540
But from erectus came all the other creatures

23:01.020 --> 23:05.100
that are related to us, all the other 20 or so species

23:05.100 --> 23:08.940
of Homo but erectus was the first.

23:08.940 --> 23:11.500
Now where does Charles Sanders' purse come in?

23:13.060 --> 23:15.540
He was by the way banned from Harvard

23:15.540 --> 23:17.620
so it's really interesting that his papers

23:17.620 --> 23:19.300
are here at Harvard then one has to come here

23:19.300 --> 23:23.860
to study purse because Charles Elliot

23:23.860 --> 23:26.140
who was president at the time didn't want him on campus

23:26.140 --> 23:31.140
because he was seen coming out of a hotel

23:31.540 --> 23:34.220
with a woman who wasn't his wife so he lost his job

23:34.220 --> 23:38.860
at Johns Hopkins University and that was the only job

23:38.860 --> 23:40.700
he ever had in academics and he was banned

23:40.700 --> 23:42.620
from the Harvard campus even though his brother

23:42.620 --> 23:44.820
was the dean of mathematics and his father

23:44.820 --> 23:47.740
had been professor of mathematics for 50 years here anyway.

23:48.820 --> 23:51.900
So he was the one who invented for the very first time,

23:51.900 --> 23:54.980
first and second order logic.

23:54.980 --> 23:57.740
That's credit is often given to Gottlieb Frege

23:57.740 --> 24:01.460
but in fact, purse had it worked out in some ways

24:01.460 --> 24:04.460
before Frege and independently about the same time.

24:04.460 --> 24:08.660
He invented semiotics, the theory of science before Sosir.

24:08.660 --> 24:11.460
He invented pragmatism from William James.

24:11.460 --> 24:13.220
There's actually an interesting correspondence

24:13.220 --> 24:15.040
between purse and James.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.340
Purse was a member of the National Academy of Sciences

24:17.340 --> 24:20.660
and he was explaining to James why he could not nominate him

24:20.660 --> 24:22.740
for membership in the National Academy of Sciences

24:22.740 --> 24:24.660
because most scientists took James.

24:24.660 --> 24:26.540
He said, we consider you a literary man,

24:26.540 --> 24:27.980
not a real scientist.

24:30.140 --> 24:34.100
But James got famous for the idea of pragmatism

24:34.100 --> 24:36.140
although the idea comes from purse.

24:36.140 --> 24:37.460
At the time that he was alive,

24:37.460 --> 24:39.980
he was considered America's greatest mathematician.

24:39.980 --> 24:42.820
The German mathematician Ernest Schroeder wrote him

24:42.820 --> 24:46.280
and said that your genius and your reputation

24:46.280 --> 24:49.620
shall shine like the sun for eons into the future

24:49.620 --> 24:54.260
which clearly was wrong but he was a brilliant

24:54.340 --> 24:55.180
mathematician.

24:55.180 --> 24:57.820
He made fundamental discoveries in mathematics.

24:57.820 --> 25:02.300
He was the first person to link the absolute length

25:02.300 --> 25:04.980
of a meter to a wavelength of light for measurements.

25:04.980 --> 25:08.100
He took over 20 different places in the globe.

25:08.100 --> 25:12.660
His only book he ever wrote was on the physical properties

25:12.660 --> 25:17.660
of light, photometric researches and he's the first person

25:18.020 --> 25:20.220
to notice that the Milky Way rotated,

25:20.220 --> 25:22.420
all sorts of things he did in his spare time.

25:22.860 --> 25:27.380
And as I will argue in the biography about purse,

25:27.380 --> 25:29.260
he was the inventor of cognitive science

25:29.260 --> 25:32.620
as we know it, sort of as we know it today.

25:32.620 --> 25:36.420
Anyway, this is purse as a young man here.

25:36.420 --> 25:38.900
He was an interesting guy.

25:38.900 --> 25:41.420
I'm gonna skip this and go on to culture

25:41.420 --> 25:44.580
because culture really is the important thing here.

25:44.580 --> 25:46.540
You can't have a language unless you have a culture

25:46.540 --> 25:49.100
and you can't have a culture unless you have a language.

25:49.100 --> 25:52.180
They're symbiotically related.

25:52.180 --> 25:55.960
Each determines or constrains and leads to the conditions

25:55.960 --> 25:57.340
to develop the other.

25:57.340 --> 26:00.420
So in my definition, culture is an abstract network,

26:00.420 --> 26:02.820
shaping and connecting social roles,

26:02.820 --> 26:05.260
hierarchically structured knowledge domains

26:05.260 --> 26:06.900
and ranked values.

26:06.900 --> 26:09.420
So ranked values are very important to culture.

26:09.420 --> 26:10.900
So it's not enough to know that people

26:10.900 --> 26:11.740
have the same values.

26:11.740 --> 26:13.660
So for example, if you're French,

26:13.660 --> 26:16.260
you might think that good food is very important

26:16.260 --> 26:19.580
and that being in good shape is also very important.

26:19.580 --> 26:22.460
And if you're from, say, Houston, Texas,

26:22.460 --> 26:24.380
you may believe the same things.

26:24.380 --> 26:27.460
But if you think that good food is more important

26:27.460 --> 26:29.780
than being in shape, you'll look one way.

26:29.780 --> 26:32.300
And if you think that being in shape is more important

26:32.300 --> 26:34.780
than good food, you'll look another way.

26:34.780 --> 26:38.860
So the value rankings are as important or more important

26:38.860 --> 26:41.140
than the actual values themselves.

26:41.140 --> 26:42.740
Culture is always shifting.

26:42.740 --> 26:50.380
So universal grammar is a very popular term.

26:50.380 --> 26:53.740
It was made popular in modern times by Noam Chomsky.

26:53.740 --> 26:56.660
Although the term goes back to the 12th century,

26:56.660 --> 26:58.580
grammarians known as the modesty.

26:58.580 --> 27:01.820
And in the US, the first person to ever talk about universal

27:01.820 --> 27:05.380
grammar was Charles Sanders Purse.

27:05.380 --> 27:10.780
His view of grammar was both he and Chomsky, interestingly

27:10.780 --> 27:15.020
enough, felt that recursion, I can

27:15.020 --> 27:16.780
talk about recursion separately, but anyway, they thought

27:16.780 --> 27:20.020
that recursion was the basis of grammar.

27:20.020 --> 27:24.060
But for Purse, it was meaning, recursive meanings, not forms,

27:24.060 --> 27:25.140
not the sentences.

27:25.140 --> 27:28.660
But the way that, so for example, if I say bachelor,

27:28.660 --> 27:33.100
I have to interpret that in terms of, say, unmarried man.

27:33.100 --> 27:35.780
And I interpret unmarried in terms of other symbols.

27:35.780 --> 27:38.260
And I interpret man in terms of other symbols

27:38.260 --> 27:42.020
so that every symbol starts us to a recursive chain that

27:42.020 --> 27:44.340
has no end.

27:44.340 --> 27:45.380
Everything is connected.

27:45.380 --> 27:47.940
And to understand one thing, we have to understand a great

27:47.940 --> 27:48.980
deal of culture.

27:51.420 --> 27:56.060
So the difference is for Purse universal grammar followed

27:56.060 --> 27:58.180
from logical principles.

27:58.180 --> 28:01.660
There was nothing necessarily genetic about it.

28:01.660 --> 28:03.740
It simply followed from logical principles.

28:03.740 --> 28:06.620
If you had symbols, they were subject to certain logical

28:06.620 --> 28:09.140
constraints, and those would affect the form of the

28:09.140 --> 28:11.540
language.

28:11.540 --> 28:15.060
Whereas the second version of universal grammar, Chomsky's

28:15.060 --> 28:20.220
is that not only is human biology responsible for

28:20.220 --> 28:24.620
underwriting human linguistic capacity, but the genes are,

28:24.620 --> 28:26.580
there are specific genes linked to language.

28:29.260 --> 28:32.860
So those are very different views of universal grammar.

28:32.860 --> 28:35.260
So now let's move on to tools.

28:35.300 --> 28:38.260
Tools turn out to be a very important part of reasoning

28:38.260 --> 28:41.460
about the origins of human language.

28:41.460 --> 28:45.420
Tools are individual devices or processes that meet perceived

28:45.420 --> 28:48.900
needs of individuals and communities, or a set of

28:48.900 --> 28:51.780
devices, processes, and expertise used to harness the

28:51.780 --> 28:54.460
properties of a particular material.

28:54.460 --> 28:57.540
Full culturally constructed repertoire of knowledge,

28:57.540 --> 28:59.940
conventions, devices, and processes.

28:59.940 --> 29:01.900
Values are vital at each stage.

29:01.900 --> 29:04.540
So tools are really complicated.

29:04.540 --> 29:06.740
This is clearly a complicated tool.

29:06.740 --> 29:07.980
But so is a shovel.

29:07.980 --> 29:13.980
A shovel has a specific kind of function, and if you make a

29:13.980 --> 29:17.820
shovel out of rubber, it won't work very well.

29:17.820 --> 29:21.300
So there's a whole lot of things that have to go into a tool

29:21.300 --> 29:25.340
as simple as a shovel or a knife to make it be what it is.

29:25.340 --> 29:29.100
And it starts to take on meaning features that go

29:29.100 --> 29:31.060
beyond its function.

29:31.100 --> 29:34.820
Human technology enmeshes the material with the ideational.

29:34.820 --> 29:40.540
We have ideas, and they're manifested materially.

29:40.540 --> 29:43.900
Tools involve social constructivism.

29:43.900 --> 29:46.900
Tools become symbols as they emerge from the values,

29:46.900 --> 29:49.060
knowledge, structures, and social roles of a particular

29:49.060 --> 29:50.140
culture.

29:50.140 --> 29:53.380
Symbolism in erectus tools is therefore crucial evidence.

29:53.380 --> 29:56.620
So that's one thing we really need to look for in addition

29:56.620 --> 29:59.300
to the other accomplishments of erectus.

29:59.300 --> 30:02.540
Now, it's true that other species have tools.

30:02.540 --> 30:07.460
But other species' tools tend to be opportunistic.

30:07.460 --> 30:09.500
And one of the interesting things, for example, about

30:09.500 --> 30:12.060
erectus is that they took very good care of their tools.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.020
They colored their tools.

30:13.020 --> 30:15.660
They carried their tools with them over long distances.

30:15.660 --> 30:17.500
They planned ahead.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.420
No other species is known to do that.

30:20.420 --> 30:23.620
Although it's a good Darwinian, I wouldn't want to say that

30:23.620 --> 30:25.740
no other species could, you know, I wouldn't want to

30:25.740 --> 30:27.300
predict what no other species could do.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.540
Because every time somebody tries to do that, we find

30:29.540 --> 30:31.820
that they can.

30:31.820 --> 30:34.140
Learning of technical skills takes place using a

30:34.140 --> 30:36.660
combination of language, gesture, imitation, and

30:36.660 --> 30:37.660
guided intervention.

30:37.660 --> 30:40.220
This applies to all erectus, neanderthal, ensus, and

30:40.220 --> 30:41.500
sapiens tools.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.100
And we'll be getting to that.

30:44.100 --> 30:46.980
This is partially based on lab experiments with stone tool

30:46.980 --> 30:47.540
users.

30:47.540 --> 30:51.020
And my experience in the Amazon, I see this too.

30:51.020 --> 30:55.420
So at the many archaeology departments, they have

30:55.420 --> 31:01.740
napping labs, K, N, A, P, P, not N, A, P. And they learn to

31:01.740 --> 31:02.420
make stone tools.

31:02.420 --> 31:04.020
Graduate students learn to make stone tools.

31:04.020 --> 31:05.540
And they bruise their hands.

31:05.540 --> 31:06.340
They cut their hands.

31:06.340 --> 31:07.700
It's really hard.

31:07.700 --> 31:10.420
So the simplest form of stone tool is like the older one

31:10.420 --> 31:13.260
tools, which we'll see a picture of.

31:13.260 --> 31:15.900
Those take a couple of hundred hours very often for

31:15.900 --> 31:19.780
students, PhD students, to learn to make accurately.

31:19.780 --> 31:23.980
When we get into the more complex tools, it takes a

31:23.980 --> 31:24.740
lot longer.

31:24.740 --> 31:28.060
And what people have found in these labs is that even the

31:28.060 --> 31:32.100
simplest tools, it's very hard to simply show by example how

31:32.100 --> 31:32.940
to do it.

31:32.940 --> 31:38.580
Language tends to be implicated in this skill

31:38.580 --> 31:39.220
acquisition.

31:39.220 --> 31:41.380
Now, this could simply be because they're sapiens, right?

31:41.380 --> 31:42.180
And sapiens talk.

31:42.180 --> 31:45.860
So why not avail yourself of the speech that you have?

31:45.860 --> 31:51.500
In the Amazon, I have watched many men teach their sons

31:51.540 --> 31:55.180
how to make tools like blowguns and bows and arrows.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.940
And a lot of the time is in silence.

31:57.940 --> 32:01.340
But then you'll often hear a question and an answer about

32:01.340 --> 32:04.140
something that was very difficult to see or a movement

32:04.140 --> 32:06.020
that was very quick.

32:06.020 --> 32:12.060
So tools take explanation in many cases.

32:12.060 --> 32:15.860
So once again, on a sign, a sign refers to an object.

32:16.260 --> 32:21.580
So if I have a sign, if I say water, that's the object.

32:21.580 --> 32:24.540
And the representation is W-A-T-E-R.

32:24.540 --> 32:26.700
And the interpretation that you're going to make is

32:26.700 --> 32:29.700
something to drink.

32:29.700 --> 32:33.740
So icons, their physical resemblance, correspondence,

32:33.740 --> 32:36.540
they don't tend to have much intentionality about them.

32:36.540 --> 32:39.660
A reflection in the water is there, whether you intended

32:39.660 --> 32:41.500
it to be there or not.

32:41.500 --> 32:44.260
But they can last after a reflection.

32:44.300 --> 32:47.420
But they can last after someone's not there.

32:47.420 --> 32:53.340
So the smell of a footprint can last for quite a while.

32:53.340 --> 32:56.820
All animals are able to interpret indexes.

32:56.820 --> 32:58.980
In fact, when we talk about animals'

32:58.980 --> 33:02.660
interpretation abilities, almost all the time in the

33:02.660 --> 33:05.180
experiments when they're talking about animals' learning

33:05.180 --> 33:07.660
symbols, in the Persian sense, they're not learning symbols.

33:07.660 --> 33:11.740
They're learning indexes and icons, which are very

33:11.740 --> 33:13.820
different levels of cognitive

33:13.820 --> 33:17.580
accomplishment from symbols.

33:17.580 --> 33:19.620
And so symbols are the final ones.

33:19.620 --> 33:21.460
And these are the properties that are important for us.

33:21.460 --> 33:22.780
No symbols, no language.

33:22.780 --> 33:24.420
They involve displacement.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.660
The thing that we're talking about doesn't actually have

33:26.660 --> 33:27.740
to be there.

33:27.740 --> 33:30.180
I can say water and hold this up, or I can say water

33:30.180 --> 33:30.820
without it there.

33:30.820 --> 33:32.460
And you still know what I'm talking about, that the

33:32.460 --> 33:35.460
object doesn't actually have to be there.

33:35.460 --> 33:36.900
Indexes last a long time.

33:36.900 --> 33:40.140
These footprints are about 3.7 million years old, found by

33:40.140 --> 33:44.820
Mary Leakey in, they're called the Laetoli footprints.

33:44.820 --> 33:47.820
And if you follow them out, you can see that it's a large

33:47.820 --> 33:51.660
Australopithesis probably, Australopithecus walking with

33:51.660 --> 33:53.780
a small one, and they walk, and they turn and look at

33:53.780 --> 33:55.980
something, and then they walk on.

33:55.980 --> 33:59.620
And it rained after they had walked by, and this is volcanic

33:59.620 --> 34:01.820
ash that hardened like concrete and left their

34:01.820 --> 34:03.620
footprints there.

34:03.620 --> 34:06.460
This is Australopithecus africanus.

34:06.460 --> 34:09.420
And as far as we can tell, they're the first creature to

34:09.420 --> 34:11.620
ever preserve an icon.

34:11.620 --> 34:16.980
So they're starting to look at things and contemplate, I

34:16.980 --> 34:18.460
don't think that's too strong a word,

34:18.460 --> 34:19.740
contemplate the similarities.

34:19.740 --> 34:23.740
So this stone, which is about 3 million years old, is called

34:23.740 --> 34:25.140
the Makapansgat pebble.

34:25.140 --> 34:28.860
It was found in a cave in South Africa, and it's unlike

34:28.860 --> 34:33.780
the material that the other stones in the cave were from.

34:33.780 --> 34:39.180
And if you look at it, it has an interesting characteristic.

34:39.180 --> 34:41.900
It looks like a smiley face.

34:41.900 --> 34:45.740
And this thing is about 3 inches by 2 inches, so it's too

34:45.740 --> 34:48.780
big to have gotten caught between their toes and carried

34:48.780 --> 34:50.900
up there coincidentally.

34:50.900 --> 34:53.540
This seems to be something that Australopithecus and

34:53.540 --> 34:56.420
Australopithecus found interesting and carried up to

34:56.420 --> 35:01.140
the cave with no particular functional role other than it

35:01.140 --> 35:04.100
looked like a face.

35:04.100 --> 35:07.300
Australopithecines also made tools.

35:07.340 --> 35:11.540
They're tools about 3.3 million years old, found in

35:11.540 --> 35:12.300
different places.

35:12.300 --> 35:17.340
They're the Oldowan tools discovered initially by the

35:17.340 --> 35:20.220
Leakey family.

35:20.220 --> 35:22.740
Icons are all over the place.

35:22.740 --> 35:26.180
In addition to seeing icons in nature, we have them in

35:26.180 --> 35:28.420
churches, and here are tools that have been actually made

35:28.420 --> 35:33.300
into icons and symbols, both.

35:33.300 --> 35:36.420
And from symbols to grammar, so how complex does a

35:36.420 --> 35:37.300
grammar have to be?

35:37.300 --> 35:40.340
Everybody will agree, every linguist will agree that you

35:40.340 --> 35:44.900
can't have a language until you have a grammar.

35:44.900 --> 35:47.220
But how complex does the grammar have to be?

35:47.220 --> 35:49.700
Well, there are a couple of different possibilities.

35:49.700 --> 35:53.500
And one of the points that I make in the book is that we

35:53.500 --> 35:55.860
find all of these in the world today.

35:55.860 --> 36:00.060
So one we could call a G1 grammar, which is just words

36:00.060 --> 36:02.220
put in a linear order.

36:02.260 --> 36:06.940
And that seems to be the case, for example, in Peta Ha and

36:06.940 --> 36:11.100
Riau, which is a language of New Guinea, which is

36:11.100 --> 36:13.060
John Saul Mary.

36:13.060 --> 36:15.100
So there's no other structure, let's say, in a

36:15.100 --> 36:15.820
language like this.

36:15.820 --> 36:20.140
There's just those three words, John Saul Mary.

36:20.140 --> 36:25.500
A G2 grammar would be like a G1 grammar, but have additional

36:25.500 --> 36:27.620
hierarchy or structure into the phrases.

36:27.620 --> 36:34.140
So the man you saw yesterday is here, where you saw

36:34.140 --> 36:40.180
yesterday as a sentence hierarchically located inside

36:40.180 --> 36:44.940
a larger sentence, or you could simply say the very big

36:44.940 --> 36:47.220
ball rolled down the hill.

36:47.220 --> 36:48.860
There you start to get more structure.

36:48.860 --> 36:51.660
It's not simply linear order of words.

36:51.660 --> 36:54.980
A G3 grammar has both recursion and hierarchy.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.300
So what is recursion?

36:56.300 --> 36:59.260
It's the ability to put one thing inside another of the

36:59.260 --> 37:01.020
same type and just keep doing it.

37:01.020 --> 37:08.340
So the man who is here said that Bill said that Mary said

37:08.340 --> 37:12.180
that Peter said that John bought a house.

37:12.180 --> 37:14.180
When you start to get structures like that so that

37:14.180 --> 37:17.340
you can say there's no longer a sentence in a language, then

37:17.340 --> 37:19.140
recursion is the best way to handle that.

37:19.140 --> 37:22.180
And recursion is communicatively very useful.

37:22.180 --> 37:24.260
You can pack a lot more information in a

37:24.260 --> 37:27.340
sentence with recursion.

37:27.340 --> 37:30.740
But I've argued that although recursion can be found in any

37:30.740 --> 37:33.980
language, it's not a necessary component of all languages.

37:33.980 --> 37:36.140
And in fact, there are good reasons why some

37:36.140 --> 37:37.500
languages would avoid it.

37:39.940 --> 37:41.820
So erectus had icons.

37:41.820 --> 37:43.500
We know that they carry things around.

37:43.500 --> 37:46.940
They didn't carry around smiley faces that we know of, but

37:46.940 --> 37:51.300
they did carry around phallic symbols like this cuttlefish

37:51.300 --> 37:57.620
bone that was found in Morocco about 450,000 years ago.

37:57.620 --> 38:02.980
And erectus also started making quite complex tools.

38:02.980 --> 38:07.460
So there are three grades of tools in the paleolithic,

38:07.460 --> 38:09.460
especially in the lower paleolithic.

38:09.460 --> 38:11.940
There are oldivon tools about 3 million years ago.

38:11.940 --> 38:16.020
There are achulian tools made as recently as 200,000 years

38:16.020 --> 38:16.820
ago.

38:16.820 --> 38:19.980
And then finally, there are levelwa tools, which are the

38:19.980 --> 38:24.060
most complex tools found in the paleolithic.

38:24.060 --> 38:27.180
So these are refined, which means they've been thinned.

38:27.180 --> 38:32.140
These take quite a bit of effort and skill to function.

38:32.140 --> 38:34.700
And they have various parts to them.

38:34.700 --> 38:37.580
You don't just start off banging two rocks together to

38:37.580 --> 38:38.260
get one of those.

38:38.260 --> 38:39.780
You have to have a plan.

38:39.780 --> 38:42.620
There are certain things that have to be cut out of the tool.

38:42.620 --> 38:47.100
It has to have a certain shape to be functional.

38:47.100 --> 38:49.220
So when erectus started working on tools, they might

38:49.260 --> 38:50.700
start with a large piece of rock.

38:50.700 --> 38:53.900
And out of that, they had to break out the pieces that

38:53.900 --> 38:57.220
they needed to get the kind of functional tool.

38:57.220 --> 39:02.780
And they make them all pretty much the same to work for them.

39:02.780 --> 39:05.140
Erectus was the first to come up with a controlled use of

39:05.140 --> 39:06.140
fire.

39:06.140 --> 39:09.540
The pre-shaping of stone tools, working them before they

39:09.540 --> 39:12.980
actually started chiseling out the tools, they used wood and

39:12.980 --> 39:14.580
bone tools as well.

39:14.580 --> 39:17.180
And we think they might have also used hafted tools.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.820
And hafted tools are quite important because that's when

39:19.820 --> 39:23.140
you tie a handle on that shows a lot of functional

39:23.140 --> 39:24.500
improvement over others.

39:24.500 --> 39:28.020
And it shows a lot of foresight and planning.

39:28.020 --> 39:35.620
So these tools had a great deal of complexity over

39:35.620 --> 39:37.420
hundreds of thousands of years.

39:37.420 --> 39:43.340
And in recent research in modern-day Ghana, Larry

39:43.340 --> 39:47.500
Barham has discovered about 900,000-year-old tools that

39:47.500 --> 39:50.820
seem to have been dyed with ochre.

39:50.820 --> 39:54.340
That's a significant finding because dyeing tools shows

39:54.340 --> 39:59.380
that that's not simply a functional aspect of toolmaking.

39:59.380 --> 40:04.340
That is an aspect of toolmaking that shows thought

40:04.340 --> 40:07.140
that goes above the mere function of the tool.

40:07.140 --> 40:10.780
Hafting tools, combinatorial thinking, imagining the

40:10.780 --> 40:14.660
future, and likely invented by erectus.

40:14.660 --> 40:16.620
It's one of the most significant technological

40:16.620 --> 40:20.220
breakthroughs in human toolmaking.

40:20.220 --> 40:23.340
And ochre is also very important.

40:23.340 --> 40:26.420
And we see things like hand axes.

40:26.420 --> 40:29.980
They had a tool kit, not nearly as extensive as an

40:29.980 --> 40:33.260
Neanderthal tool kit or as a Homo sapiens tool kit, but as

40:33.260 --> 40:35.820
an extensive tool kit.

40:35.820 --> 40:37.700
They had hand axes and cleavers.

40:37.700 --> 40:39.540
They had picks.

40:39.580 --> 40:41.180
And so we see different stages.

40:41.180 --> 40:43.980
We should recall the simple stage of Oldowan tools that we

40:43.980 --> 40:47.860
saw that Australopithecus had.

40:47.860 --> 40:49.500
We see achulian tools.

40:49.500 --> 40:52.060
These are already starting to get refined and showing a lot

40:52.060 --> 40:53.340
more work.

40:53.340 --> 40:57.860
And then we get to the Cadillac of the tools of

40:57.860 --> 41:01.420
erectus-level-wa tools.

41:01.420 --> 41:04.220
Not everyone agrees that erectus-made-level-wa tools.

41:04.900 --> 41:11.900
Some are dated as early as 625,000 BC.

41:11.900 --> 41:13.900
But not everyone agrees with those dates.

41:13.900 --> 41:18.980
The dates that do have the widest agreement are about

41:18.980 --> 41:22.740
300,000 years ago.

41:22.740 --> 41:24.900
That would mean that they could have been used by

41:24.900 --> 41:27.420
Neanderthals or sapiens or erectus.

41:27.420 --> 41:30.740
So it's difficult to limit them exclusively to erectus.

41:30.740 --> 41:33.820
However, a million years ago, we see larger tools that are

41:33.860 --> 41:37.300
made with the same way that level-wa tools are made.

41:37.300 --> 41:43.220
Level-wa tools require a lot of hammer work before the

41:43.220 --> 41:46.900
final stage, which is lifting the core out of the larger

41:46.900 --> 41:47.780
tool.

41:47.780 --> 41:51.700
And that takes a lot of planning, a lot of discussion,

41:51.700 --> 41:54.020
or a lot of skill.

41:54.020 --> 41:58.860
And many of the people who study the tools, a fairly wide

41:58.860 --> 42:02.980
consensus, is that level-wa tools can't be learned by

42:02.980 --> 42:04.020
imitation alone.

42:04.020 --> 42:07.620
There has to be linguistic instruction when we get to

42:07.620 --> 42:09.740
this level of tool complexity.

42:09.740 --> 42:14.620
And these tools were, in fact, found as early as a million

42:14.620 --> 42:18.380
years ago tools that were made by the same process.

42:18.380 --> 42:20.820
Not everyone would call them by the same name, but they

42:20.820 --> 42:22.940
were made by the same process.

42:22.940 --> 42:25.460
So every tool that was made had to have various

42:25.460 --> 42:26.540
functional features.

42:26.540 --> 42:31.020
So if we find tools that have nothing but functional

42:31.020 --> 42:35.220
features, it's difficult to see anything symbolic in that.

42:35.220 --> 42:38.820
We can say of any tool that it's an index of the task to

42:38.820 --> 42:42.100
be performed, it's an icon of other tools.

42:42.100 --> 42:44.580
You have one tool as a model to make another tool.

42:44.580 --> 42:51.300
So it does represent a growth in signification.

42:51.300 --> 42:53.420
But to get to the level of symbols, we need to see

42:53.420 --> 42:56.500
things that aren't simply part of the function.

42:56.500 --> 43:00.020
And we start to see some of this at the end of the

43:00.020 --> 43:00.980
Acheulean age.

43:00.980 --> 43:06.020
We see tools that are made a little bit more elaborately

43:06.020 --> 43:07.140
than they need to be made.

43:07.140 --> 43:10.940
They're painted, they're dyed.

43:10.940 --> 43:13.940
And in fact, when Larry and I were working on some tools

43:13.940 --> 43:19.180
that he had just brought back from Africa this past summer,

43:19.180 --> 43:23.500
another expert on erectus tools walked into his lab at

43:23.500 --> 43:27.020
Liverpool and said, oh, those are from East Africa.

43:27.020 --> 43:32.620
Because apparently East African and West African erectus

43:32.620 --> 43:35.540
designed their tools in different ways.

43:35.540 --> 43:38.540
So the design of the tools was representative of the group

43:38.540 --> 43:39.900
that they came from.

43:39.900 --> 43:43.940
They indicated robustness.

43:43.940 --> 43:46.540
One of the earliest ideas when they started to find these

43:46.540 --> 43:50.300
non-functional aspects of erectus tools was that it was

43:50.300 --> 43:53.660
men showing off for women, making the tools to show that

43:53.660 --> 43:54.740
they were better tool makers.

43:54.740 --> 43:56.580
But of course, we have no idea whether it was men who made

43:56.580 --> 43:58.660
the tools or women who made the tools.

43:58.660 --> 43:59.500
So we don't know.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.380
There was somebody who was probably showing off, but we

44:01.380 --> 44:02.940
don't know who was showing off.

44:02.940 --> 44:06.860
But then we find really interesting things about

44:06.860 --> 44:11.460
erectus that are difficult to explain.

44:11.460 --> 44:16.620
And we find that, so this shell is 750,000 years old.

44:16.620 --> 44:20.140
And the markings on this shell were done in Java by a

44:20.140 --> 44:25.380
homo erectus using a shark tooth on this large shell.

44:25.380 --> 44:28.020
And the marks were made without ever picking up the shark

44:28.020 --> 44:32.340
tooth, their constant continuous representation.

44:32.340 --> 44:34.740
And we start to see a lot of this kind of thing with

44:34.740 --> 44:39.100
erectus, this kind of attempt to represent things such as

44:39.100 --> 44:39.980
this rock.

44:39.980 --> 44:43.580
We find these geometric shapes that erectus is starting to

44:43.580 --> 44:47.340
carve into shells and into tools so that we realize that

44:47.340 --> 44:50.900
erectus is starting to see things beyond their mere

44:50.900 --> 44:52.260
functionality.

44:52.300 --> 44:57.860
And then about 250,000 years ago, we find this Venus of

44:57.860 --> 45:01.980
Barakat Ram, which is in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem,

45:01.980 --> 45:08.500
which has got red ochre on it, partially formed by humans,

45:08.500 --> 45:10.940
partially formed by nature.

45:10.940 --> 45:14.460
But it's the first real artwork that we know about.

45:14.460 --> 45:16.300
There are others about the same time.

45:16.300 --> 45:19.460
And it does seem to have been made by erectus.

45:19.460 --> 45:24.220
So erectus tools, they have symbolic and social components.

45:24.220 --> 45:26.220
They go beyond the functionally necessary.

45:26.220 --> 45:27.220
They go into style.

45:27.220 --> 45:29.460
They represent one tradition over another.

45:29.460 --> 45:32.300
They're beyond icons and indexes.

45:32.300 --> 45:35.740
They're simultaneously indexes of task, icons of other

45:35.740 --> 45:37.980
tools, and symbols of the values and labor of the

45:37.980 --> 45:40.540
community.

45:40.540 --> 45:44.300
Symbols in linear order simply turn out to be language.

45:44.300 --> 45:47.780
As soon as you can start symbolizing things, you have

45:47.780 --> 45:50.660
the ingredients that are necessary for language.

45:50.660 --> 45:55.220
So if they had language, what other things did they do that

45:55.220 --> 45:57.140
might have shown that they had language?

45:57.140 --> 46:01.540
So the tools show us that they had the ability to symbolize

46:01.540 --> 46:04.180
and this would have been a cognitive

46:04.180 --> 46:05.900
breakthrough for language.

46:05.900 --> 46:08.180
But is there any other evidence?

46:08.180 --> 46:09.780
Well, it turns out that there are.

46:09.780 --> 46:12.180
But let's talk about how you get to modern languages from

46:12.180 --> 46:13.380
just a few symbols.

46:13.380 --> 46:16.060
Most things are enhancements.

46:16.100 --> 46:17.300
So we add things.

46:17.300 --> 46:20.740
So you have language systems that decide what they're

46:20.740 --> 46:21.540
going to represent.

46:21.540 --> 46:23.020
What is it that you want to talk about?

46:23.020 --> 46:26.460
So among the pita ha, for example, there are no numbers.

46:26.460 --> 46:27.460
There are no color words.

46:27.460 --> 46:28.900
They don't have the number one.

46:28.900 --> 46:31.980
Does this mean that they're cognitively deficient?

46:31.980 --> 46:34.620
Well, they also don't have golf clubs.

46:34.620 --> 46:36.340
There are a lot of things they don't have and a lot of

46:36.340 --> 46:37.220
things we don't have.

46:37.220 --> 46:41.900
How many men in here know how to make a good bow and arrow?

46:41.900 --> 46:44.020
They produce what their culture needs.

46:44.020 --> 46:45.740
Their culture doesn't need numbers.

46:45.740 --> 46:47.740
They don't have numbers.

46:47.740 --> 46:50.180
And this has been verified with a lot of experiments over

46:50.180 --> 46:52.060
the years.

46:52.060 --> 46:56.220
So they also don't represent tense, but they don't have

46:56.220 --> 46:58.380
past tense or present tense or future tense.

46:58.380 --> 47:02.220
But they have a lot of ways of distinguishing different

47:02.220 --> 47:05.260
perspectives on how an action takes place, whether it took

47:05.260 --> 47:07.620
place at a certain height, whether it took place near

47:07.620 --> 47:08.740
the river.

47:08.740 --> 47:10.660
So they build into their verbs.

47:10.660 --> 47:14.380
How many verb forms does English have?

47:14.380 --> 47:15.940
It's pretty poor.

47:15.940 --> 47:18.180
Five, sing, sing, sung, singing, sings.

47:18.180 --> 47:18.660
That's it.

47:18.660 --> 47:22.820
You've exhausted the entire word grammar of English with

47:22.820 --> 47:23.660
those.

47:23.660 --> 47:26.980
But if you go on to Spanish or Portuguese, you'll get 30 to

47:26.980 --> 47:29.060
50 types of verbs.

47:29.060 --> 47:34.100
But in Pida ha, since there are 16 suffixes possible, you

47:34.100 --> 47:37.900
have two to the 16 possible verb forms, which is about

47:37.900 --> 47:40.260
65,000 verb forms.

47:40.260 --> 47:43.060
So their grammar is not like ours.

47:43.060 --> 47:47.140
It has very complex verbs, but simple in other ways

47:47.140 --> 47:49.740
compared to us.

47:49.740 --> 47:52.620
It's what a culture decides to represent that starts to work

47:52.620 --> 47:55.100
its way into the language.

47:55.100 --> 47:58.580
Conceptual systems, how do we interpret these things?

47:58.580 --> 48:00.940
Do we interpret these things strictly based on the symbols

48:00.940 --> 48:01.420
we see?

48:01.420 --> 48:05.900
Do we interpret them based on other cultural nuances?

48:05.900 --> 48:08.260
And these all start to form part of the language and enter

48:08.260 --> 48:09.780
the language in different ways.

48:09.820 --> 48:13.420
Linguistic systems will have different rules, different

48:13.420 --> 48:16.300
structures, different constraints.

48:16.300 --> 48:21.140
So this shows that language has at least these major

48:21.140 --> 48:24.300
components, the objects, the ways they're interpreted, and

48:24.300 --> 48:26.340
the forms that we choose to represent them in.

48:26.340 --> 48:27.500
And languages differ a lot.

48:27.500 --> 48:30.500
So if I say yesterday, what did John give to Mary in the

48:30.500 --> 48:33.380
library, there's intonation.

48:33.380 --> 48:38.940
My pitch is modulated, depending on whether it's a

48:38.940 --> 48:41.220
question or a statement.

48:41.220 --> 48:43.500
And these are add-ons to make things clear.

48:43.500 --> 48:46.740
It's not necessary to have this intuition to distinguish

48:46.740 --> 48:50.700
questions from statements, but it is very, very useful.

48:50.700 --> 48:53.780
In Piedahá, like many of the world's languages, probably

48:53.780 --> 48:56.780
close to half of the world's languages, such as Chinese and

48:56.780 --> 48:58.780
Korean and others, the language is tonal.

48:58.780 --> 49:02.460
So the word for ear in Piedahá is awe.

49:02.460 --> 49:05.180
And the word for foreigner is awe.

49:05.180 --> 49:07.180
And the word for skin is awe.

49:07.180 --> 49:09.860
And the word for Brazilian shell is awe.

49:09.860 --> 49:13.460
And the word for hand is awe.

49:13.460 --> 49:21.300
So if I whistled it, and those are all very important in

49:21.300 --> 49:21.660
Piedahá.

49:21.660 --> 49:24.540
So you've got to be able to hear those tonal distinctions.

49:24.540 --> 49:27.620
But obviously, tone's not necessary, because we don't

49:27.620 --> 49:28.380
have it in English.

49:28.380 --> 49:31.700
And although English may not be as attractive sounding as

49:31.700 --> 49:34.860
Piedahá, it still seems to work.

49:34.860 --> 49:36.900
So there are all sorts of things we can add.

49:36.900 --> 49:39.300
Once we get symbols, there are all ways that we can embellish

49:39.300 --> 49:42.500
them with sound structures and the kinds of syllables we use,

49:42.500 --> 49:45.980
the way we organize things.

49:45.980 --> 49:48.740
And then we start to think about how languages

49:48.740 --> 49:50.380
represented in the brain.

49:50.380 --> 49:54.220
And in the work of Evelina Fedorenko at MIT's Brain and

49:54.220 --> 49:59.460
Cognitive Sciences Department, she's found that languages,

49:59.460 --> 50:02.420
not at all, found in just one part of the brain, as people

50:02.420 --> 50:04.860
thought for many years, but that it's distributed

50:04.860 --> 50:09.140
throughout the brain in what she calls a language network.

50:09.140 --> 50:14.220
And that this network is fairly similar across all languages

50:14.220 --> 50:16.660
and across all people.

50:16.660 --> 50:19.140
But it's a lot more complicated than simply saying it's in

50:19.140 --> 50:21.900
Broca's area, if you've heard of that area, or

50:21.900 --> 50:23.180
Vernike's area.

50:23.180 --> 50:25.700
Actually, the interesting thing about Broca's patient is

50:25.700 --> 50:29.300
the part of his brain that was damaged was not Broca's area.

50:29.300 --> 50:35.820
But simplistic views of where language is found in the brain

50:35.820 --> 50:39.500
are being challenged every day by more research.

50:39.500 --> 50:45.620
So there are various ways that we enhance grammar in morphemes,

50:45.620 --> 50:49.820
our little parts of words, like the 65,000 Piedoha word forms.

50:49.820 --> 50:52.500
There are phrases, sentences, paragraphs, discourses,

50:52.500 --> 50:53.340
conversations.

50:53.340 --> 50:57.780
All of these are important, and they occur naturally over time.

50:57.780 --> 51:01.380
The interesting thing about language, although it's very

51:01.380 --> 51:04.780
complicated, once we start to look at a finished system, we

51:04.780 --> 51:07.660
can see that its components are relatively simple and build up

51:07.660 --> 51:11.580
over time, and that the core component to every aspect of

51:11.580 --> 51:14.780
the language that's been built up is the symbol.

51:14.780 --> 51:17.220
So what else did erectus do?

51:17.220 --> 51:21.500
Well, just under two million years ago, they were spread

51:21.500 --> 51:23.020
out across the world.

51:23.020 --> 51:26.260
That we find them in Beijing, we find them in Iran, we find

51:26.260 --> 51:29.260
them in various parts of the world.

51:29.260 --> 51:30.180
We find erectus.

51:30.180 --> 51:34.780
There were still many in Africa, and so they were traveling.

51:34.780 --> 51:40.980
And we find a 790,000-year-old settlement in Israel,

51:40.980 --> 51:43.620
Geshe Benoit Yaakov.

51:43.620 --> 51:45.860
And in there, we find the controlled use of fire,

51:45.860 --> 51:52.420
specialized spaces, various components that show, for

51:52.420 --> 51:56.860
example, separate areas of the settlement are used for

51:56.860 --> 52:00.300
processing meat, processing fish, processing plant, what

52:00.300 --> 52:02.140
seem to be communal areas.

52:02.140 --> 52:07.660
So erectus did seem to have the ability to have an

52:07.660 --> 52:08.540
organized society.

52:08.540 --> 52:13.500
There's evidence that their society was organized.

52:13.500 --> 52:16.820
And this is found in this ongoing work in Israel and

52:16.820 --> 52:17.580
other places.

52:17.580 --> 52:21.100
This is found where the black dot is, is an erectus

52:21.100 --> 52:22.380
settlement in Israel.

52:22.380 --> 52:26.020
There are a lot of interesting archaic human sites in the

52:26.020 --> 52:28.860
Middle East, in Israel, and other places.

52:28.860 --> 52:31.220
Because if you're coming out of Africa at the time they were

52:31.220 --> 52:34.900
coming out, because the Sahara Desert was actually a lush

52:34.900 --> 52:37.980
green forest, you come out, turn right.

52:37.980 --> 52:39.460
And it's all you can do.

52:39.460 --> 52:40.860
You can't go straight, because that's the ocean.

52:40.860 --> 52:43.780
Turn right, and you're in the Middle East.

52:43.780 --> 52:45.780
And that's why we find those to be some of the

52:45.780 --> 52:46.340
earliest settlements.

52:46.340 --> 52:50.300
So here's the excavation in Israel, finding these

52:50.300 --> 52:52.740
different aspects of it.

52:52.740 --> 52:59.180
There's also good evidence that erectus traveled across

52:59.180 --> 53:03.660
distances they could not see across in the ocean.

53:03.660 --> 53:05.300
And there are several interesting

53:05.300 --> 53:06.500
things to draw from this.

53:06.500 --> 53:09.860
First of all, most marine archaeologists argue that you

53:09.860 --> 53:13.940
can't have a viable human community without 20 to 40

53:13.940 --> 53:18.140
people arriving roughly at the same time in an area.

53:18.140 --> 53:21.900
So when we find evidence of viable human culture in

53:21.900 --> 53:26.740
places like Flores in Indonesia, so if you look at

53:26.740 --> 53:30.700
the island of Flores in Indonesia, the point where

53:30.700 --> 53:34.540
erectus would have had to cross is about 28 miles.

53:34.540 --> 53:38.100
So it's about the size of the English Channel.

53:38.100 --> 53:40.940
You could think, well, people swim the English Channel, and

53:40.940 --> 53:43.700
we know that other animals could swim across.

53:43.700 --> 53:49.340
But Flores is split off from the rest of what would have

53:49.340 --> 53:53.620
been at that time the mainland by the strongest ocean

53:53.620 --> 53:54.620
current in the world.

53:54.620 --> 53:57.300
It's called the Pacific Through Flow.

53:57.300 --> 54:01.900
And it was the same current back then, 750,000 years ago,

54:01.900 --> 54:02.620
as far as we can tell.

54:02.620 --> 54:05.500
So it was too difficult for a human to swim

54:05.500 --> 54:06.380
across that current.

54:06.380 --> 54:09.340
In fact, if you just put a raft in the water or just put a

54:09.340 --> 54:13.100
log in the water and start off, you're going to get

54:13.100 --> 54:14.420
washed out to sea.

54:14.420 --> 54:15.700
You're not going to make it to Flores.

54:15.700 --> 54:17.100
The current is too strong.

54:17.100 --> 54:20.700
So for humans who have gotten there, it's highly likely

54:20.700 --> 54:23.940
that they had boat-building capability.

54:23.940 --> 54:28.180
In fact, an archaeologist in Australia, Robert Bednarik,

54:28.180 --> 54:34.940
has built boats using erectus tools, etchulian tools, and

54:34.940 --> 54:38.700
level-wa tools, and shown that he can build boats that

54:38.700 --> 54:41.380
can get there in that period of time.

54:41.380 --> 54:44.700
The question is, could they have done that without language?

54:44.700 --> 54:49.940
And there's an article by a moxplunk evolutionary

54:49.940 --> 54:53.500
anthropologist, David Gill, called, how much grammar do

54:53.500 --> 54:55.300
you need to build a boat?

54:55.300 --> 54:59.300
And he argues that you actually don't need much grammar,

54:59.300 --> 55:01.780
but you do need language to be able to build a boat.

55:01.780 --> 55:04.340
And so the idea that they could sail, and this is a

55:04.340 --> 55:07.860
controversial idea, most things said about the past are

55:07.860 --> 55:11.980
controversial, because you can say they got there, and they

55:11.980 --> 55:14.220
had to get there in a certain number.

55:14.220 --> 55:16.460
But you can't show that they got several places.

55:16.460 --> 55:21.020
The ideal thing would be to show them in places where we

55:21.020 --> 55:21.500
know.

55:21.500 --> 55:22.780
So some people have argued they got

55:22.780 --> 55:25.700
across by tsunamis, right?

55:25.700 --> 55:30.220
But that sort of defies the physics of tsunamis, which tend

55:30.220 --> 55:32.100
to come towards the land.

55:32.100 --> 55:34.740
Now there are cases of people who've been found out to see

55:34.740 --> 55:37.660
there was a Japanese guy found floating on a roof, I think,

55:37.660 --> 55:41.140
after the tsunami that hit Japan a couple of years ago.

55:41.140 --> 55:43.900
So it does occasionally happen, but it doesn't seem to be a

55:43.900 --> 55:48.380
very productive way of travel, sort of fortuitous.

55:48.380 --> 55:51.180
And they did this a lot, even in places where we don't know

55:51.180 --> 55:52.780
of tsunamis having hit.

55:52.780 --> 55:55.260
So Kotra, the Russian archaeological team, found

55:55.260 --> 56:01.580
evidence in Sokotra 1.4 million years ago, which is 150

56:01.580 --> 56:04.420
miles from the closest land.

56:04.420 --> 56:07.500
We start to see evidence of potential burial.

56:07.540 --> 56:10.220
This stone on the right is called Excalibur.

56:10.220 --> 56:14.700
It's a colored handaxe of the period, a Julian handaxe, and

56:14.700 --> 56:15.940
it was found in a grave.

56:15.940 --> 56:18.180
Does that mean it was buried on purpose with them?

56:18.180 --> 56:19.740
We start to see evidence of that.

56:19.740 --> 56:23.420
It's difficult to say convincingly that it was, but it

56:23.420 --> 56:27.100
is interesting that it was a colored handaxe found.

56:27.100 --> 56:29.620
Around the time that Neanderthal was starting to

56:29.620 --> 56:33.860
appear, the erectus Neanderthal transition period, we

56:33.860 --> 56:38.780
find wooden spears that were preserved for almost 400,000

56:38.780 --> 56:42.940
years, according to some dating, which would have put them

56:42.940 --> 56:46.020
back in the time of erectus.

56:46.020 --> 56:52.420
So erectus, about 1.5 million years ago, they start making

56:52.420 --> 56:54.700
extremely complicated tools.

56:54.700 --> 56:56.700
They start traveling around the world.

56:56.700 --> 56:59.900
They start an evolutionary process physical where they

56:59.900 --> 57:03.820
start to get more articulate speech, the capacity for

57:03.820 --> 57:05.300
more articulate speech.

57:05.300 --> 57:07.540
They seem to be mastering boat travel.

57:07.540 --> 57:09.820
The ocean was never a barrier to erectus.

57:09.820 --> 57:12.180
Anytime there's an ocean barrier, you can expect to

57:12.180 --> 57:14.540
find erectus on the other side.

57:14.540 --> 57:17.740
They had organized settlements.

57:17.740 --> 57:22.340
So all of these tasks imply the likelihood of language.

57:22.340 --> 57:26.140
If we look at other species and we see species that are far

57:26.140 --> 57:28.780
removed from humans that seem to approximate some sort of

57:28.780 --> 57:33.260
linguistic ability, it's hardly surprising that what we

57:33.300 --> 57:35.540
would see an even greater ability in these creatures

57:35.540 --> 57:37.980
that were so much like us and had almost

57:37.980 --> 57:40.580
modern-sized brains.

57:40.580 --> 57:44.820
So if it's correct, there is evidence for language.

57:44.820 --> 57:48.060
Nobody could say this case has been proven, but it is

57:48.060 --> 57:48.820
highly likely.

57:48.820 --> 57:51.700
Once we take off the burden of languages looking like

57:51.700 --> 57:54.660
modern languages and we realize that a language is the

57:54.660 --> 57:57.620
transfer of information by the discovery and use of

57:57.620 --> 58:01.020
symbols and elaboration of those symbols over time, then

58:01.020 --> 58:03.860
we see a gradual evolution of language and we see

58:03.860 --> 58:07.420
evidence of erectus and no reason to withhold the

58:07.420 --> 58:10.340
judgment that they had language to account for all the

58:10.340 --> 58:14.020
different things that they were able to accomplish in

58:14.020 --> 58:16.020
their long history.

58:16.020 --> 58:17.620
They were preceded by these guys.

58:17.620 --> 58:22.820
These are just the various species of Australopithecines.

58:22.820 --> 58:27.060
Nature experimented a lot before it got to us.

58:27.060 --> 58:30.860
That could mean that we're the best or it could mean that

58:30.860 --> 58:34.820
it doesn't necessarily mean that we're the best.

58:34.820 --> 58:40.500
And when we ask where erectus went, just look around.

58:40.500 --> 58:43.020
We are erectus.

58:43.020 --> 58:52.140
Erectus was the ancestor of Neanderthal, of sapiens, of

58:52.140 --> 58:55.980
every other human creature that has existed.

58:55.980 --> 58:58.900
They were the smartest creatures the world had ever seen.

58:58.900 --> 59:00.340
They were the most widely traveled.

59:00.340 --> 59:03.220
They sailed, they built fire, they had settlements.

59:03.220 --> 59:08.060
They had strong evidence for symbolism in their tools.

59:08.060 --> 59:11.820
It's very difficult to see why we would withhold the

59:11.820 --> 59:16.460
judgment that they likely had language.

59:16.460 --> 59:20.020
And what they had to have had was more than simply grunts

59:20.020 --> 59:21.500
and squeals.

59:21.500 --> 59:24.300
They had to have something that was able to communicate

59:24.300 --> 59:27.700
actual content about the world around them, the kind of

59:27.700 --> 59:29.820
thing that would have been essential and been

59:29.820 --> 59:30.740
discovered and symboled.

59:30.740 --> 59:31.700
So thank you very much.

59:52.380 --> 59:53.940
We have time for a few questions.

59:53.940 --> 59:57.180
If anyone wants to raise their hand, I can run this.

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:02.700
Hello.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.180
Thank you for a nice talk.

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:09.980
To my knowledge, what is peculiar to Homo sapiens is

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:15.020
the use of actual, what we would today call, artwork,

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:18.100
such as was seen, of course, in the stone caves in France

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:21.220
and perhaps in Africa earlier.

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.660
Your talk is the first I've heard where you can say that

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:28.820
Homo erectus was actually doing, I don't know if you call it

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:29.660
art or not.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.060
Of course, today we still don't know what is art and what

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.660
is not, but that's another matter.

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:38.020
But that is one thing that seems to have been peculiar.

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:42.020
Even that occurred relatively late in the lifetime of

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.260
Homo sapiens.

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:46.300
Also, I'd be interested to know if you think Homo erectus,

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:49.980
not only had learned how to use fire, but had actually

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.180
learned how to make it.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.220
So thank you.

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.780
Yeah.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:57.100
On fire, the archaeological evidence seems to be that,

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:57.980
yes, they could make it.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.140
They had controlled use of fire.

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:01.260
We find it regularly in their settlements.

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:05.540
As far as artwork, this is a red herring that a lot of

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:10.340
archaeologists have thought to be somewhat important,

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:12.540
because we think of art as symbolic.

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:15.180
Actually, some art is symbolic, but a lot of art,

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:17.980
especially representational art, is simply iconic.

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:20.140
It's a lower level of cognitive

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:21.340
development than symbolism.

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:27.260
So art is a wonderful accomplishment, but it's not

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:29.180
crucial to the linguistic line.

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.900
It's a sort of red herring to think that if we find

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:35.300
painting, it's almost certain that if we find painting,

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.300
they could talk.

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.860
But there's no argument from that to that if we don't find

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:41.660
painting, they couldn't talk.

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:43.460
Painting is just a development.

01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:45.460
Cultures develop over time.

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:48.180
And I know of many cultures that I've done research on in

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.500
the Amazon that have no art, but they certainly can talk.

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:59.860
They don't do anything that is more elaborate in some ways

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:01.420
than Homo erectus did.

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:04.300
Homo erectus was a hunter-gatherer ban.

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:08.820
And so we find many cultures today that live fairly

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.140
similarly.

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.180
They're a lot smarter.

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:12.100
They have bigger brains.

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:15.500
They can think of other things.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.940
And if you take them out of the hunter-gatherer ban and raise

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:21.100
them in a city, they'll be unrecognizable for anybody else

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.540
who was raised in the city, which I doubt would be the case

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:24.380
for Homo erectus.

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:31.220
But at the same time, art doesn't.

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.580
We want to say that art represents language because

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.780
it's complicated cultural accomplishment.

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:40.620
And it can be symbolic, but it's often simply iconic.

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:43.540
So art seems to be a separate cultural development that is

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:45.420
off the line of language evolution.

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:49.780
And I don't find it convincing to say that art is either here

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:52.580
nor there when it comes to language evolution.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:04.180
Tasty.

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:07.940
How would you describe the limitations of their language?

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:08.780
Of erectus?

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:09.620
Yes.

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:16.820
So I work with languages that have similar properties.

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:19.540
I mean, so in other words, if you think about what the

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:23.660
simplest grammar could be, just words in a linear order, I've

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:24.860
worked with languages like that.

01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:28.780
And the fact is they can say anything we can say.

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.380
The complicated grammars that we have have very useful

01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:35.980
communicative functions, but they are not necessary to

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.300
express modern thought or complicated thought.

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:43.700
So the fact that somebody, we can say they have a simple

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.020
grammar doesn't mean they have simple thought.

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.140
That's another thing that has happened in the history of

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:52.740
anthropology and linguistics to somehow think that language

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.260
is the mirror of thought.

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:55.740
And it doesn't have to be.

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.300
There are a lot of things.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.620
For example, I work with hunter-gatherer groups that

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:03.460
have very few words for time.

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:05.420
Does this mean they don't know there was yesterday?

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:07.940
So the Piedohan, for example, have no word for yesterday and

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:09.020
no word for tomorrow.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:11.580
And we often find that this or that culture doesn't have a

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:15.260
word for X, and so we drive all kinds of conclusions from it.

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.500
But I don't see any conclusions to draw from that.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:18.940
They can think about those things.

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.220
Everybody knows they got up yesterday, and they're getting

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.220
up today, and they'll probably get up tomorrow.

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.500
But the fact that they choose not to talk about them is a

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.940
separate kind of cultural value.

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:33.460
So I don't find the simplicity of grammar connected very

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:35.420
tightly to the complexity of thought.

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:47.780
Yeah, if they had symbols, they probably didn't have many

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:48.980
limitations.

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:51.660
I mean, you could say maybe they had the intelligence of an

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:55.060
eight-year-old or a 10-year-old sapient's child.

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:57.460
No way to really know that, but let's say they did.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.180
Eight-year-olds can talk a lot.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:08.500
I'm curious if we know how easy or difficult it is to know

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:14.380
whether a tool that they used was made by them and not

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:15.660
created by nature.

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:18.340
How can we discern?

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.780
Well, it's always very hard when you're going back in time to

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:24.660
have dating methods that can link them to a species.

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:28.180
So if you find a tool that's 600,000 years old, they were

01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:30.580
the only ones around.

01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:33.860
Nobody else was around, so they made it.

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:37.940
But if you find a tool that was 150,000 years old, well,

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:40.580
there were a lot of species of humans around at that time.

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:43.580
So narrowing it down to Homo erectus becomes more

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:47.820
difficult, but you can guess based on the settlement

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:48.260
patterns.

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:50.500
But it's difficult to tell with precision once you start

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:54.300
getting into the area where other Homo species were

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:55.780
existing side by side.

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.380
Oh, that it was made.

01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:06.060
Some of the older on tools could have just one rock fell on

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.300
another, and suddenly you get this.

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:10.340
But these Atulian tools, these more complex tools, there's

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.300
no way they came about by accident.

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:16.540
They had to have been designed, planned, and constructed

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.420
with a great deal of craftsmanship.

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:22.700
It takes hundreds of hours, at least 500 hours, from what I've

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:25.860
heard, for graduate student in archaeology to be able to make

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:30.820
an Atulian handaxe, not to make, that's how long it takes

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.340
to learn it.

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:32.980
They can make them faster after that.

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:44.180
I'm curious to know what led to the, I guess, eventual demise

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:48.580
of this species given your talk, how successful they have

01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:52.380
been at traveling and establishing communities

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:54.380
all around the world.

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:58.820
So I'm just curious, what led to a global end

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:01.380
to such a successful run?

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:05.020
Yeah, that's a very good question.

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.060
We're the only ones left standing.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.980
So did they die out?

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:11.260
Did they become us?

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.380
One answer is they didn't die.

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:15.580
We are them.

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:19.740
The other answer is that Homo sapiens is, they're smarter,

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:22.940
and one thing we've shown as a species throughout our history

01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:27.420
is the ability to slaughter other people that look like us.

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:30.540
So the fact that the Homo sapiens might have killed them all

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:33.700
doesn't seem to have, that doesn't seem to be totally

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.620
outside the realm of possibility either.

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.580
So I don't know why they disappeared.

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:40.780
And I was asked a similar question

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:42.180
when I was giving a talk in Hungary,

01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.140
and I probably should have been more careful.

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:47.260
But I said, the Hungarian Jews didn't disappear

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:50.780
because they didn't have language.

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:54.060
So there are all kinds of reasons that people disappear.

01:07:55.060 --> 01:08:06.060
Hi.

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:07.700
You briefly said at the beginning

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.020
that the Homo erectus, there was one

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:12.060
that they found a hyoid bone in it,

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:15.540
so that you're speculating that then they have vocal cords

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:20.780
and they could then produce sounds.

01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:25.420
So are you thinking the later species all had the hyoid bones

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:27.540
and could vocalize?

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.580
We don't really know.

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:32.540
Some people, to come to Fitch would believe

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:36.460
that we almost certainly had, Homo erectus

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:38.980
had this modern speech capability.

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:42.860
My point is that it really doesn't matter.

01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:45.500
Evolving modern speech is a tremendous advantage,

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.660
but it's not a necessary condition,

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:50.180
nor is it a sufficient condition for having language.

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:52.900
We can look at other species that seem to have.

01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:56.140
We listen to a parrot.

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.380
They can produce human speech sounds fairly well.

01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:00.660
That's so it shows that it's not a sufficient condition

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:04.100
for language, and the fact that erectus might not have had it

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.980
would show that it's not a necessary condition

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:08.980
for language, because we have deaf people today

01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:10.580
who talk with American sign language

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:12.500
and say anything we can say.

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.980
So language is looking for a physical medium

01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:20.100
to be transmitted, and that usually, and most efficiently,

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:21.140
is human speech.

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.300
And with quantal vowels and modern speech,

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.500
we can communicate much more clearly,

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.500
but it's neither necessary nor sufficient to have language.

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.020
They could have produced sounds.

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:36.380
They might not have been very clear,

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.700
but the reason that chimpanzees don't talk

01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:41.020
is not because they can't produce sounds.

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:42.180
They produce enough sounds.

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:45.540
My point about computers is that any creature that

01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:49.820
can produce two sounds could talk in principle.

01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:55.100
My dog makes a lot of sounds, and I understand a lot of them.

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:57.060
I'm trying to figure out if any of them are symbols,

01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:03.100
but they're certainly, she's very articulate in letting

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:06.260
me know when it's time to do certain things.

01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:11.500
So I have mastered a repertoire of her sounds,

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.500
and she uses them.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.340
But that doesn't mean that she, I

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:17.820
don't expect her to give me advice about how

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:22.260
to find my grandmother in Ancestry.com or something

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.340
like that.

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:24.780
These are cultural accomplishments

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:30.060
that require a much greater set of symbols.

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.620
I think that is about all we have time for.
