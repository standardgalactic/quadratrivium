1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,920
Thanks so much for joining us tonight.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,880
My name is Serena Longo, and on behalf of Harvard Book Store,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,180
the Harvard University Division of Science, the Cabot Science

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,100
Library, and Mass Humanities, I'm so

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,640
excited to welcome you to our program tonight

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,040
with Daniel L. Everett presenting his latest book,

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,280
How Language Began, The Story of Humanity's Greatest Invention.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,840
In just a moment, I'll turn things over

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,440
to Professor Melissa Franklin, who

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,480
will be introducing the program tonight.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,960
But first, I'd like to say a few words about the series

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,680
and how you can learn more about our spring season.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,760
The Science Book Talk series features talks

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,920
throughout the academic year by authors

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,340
of recently published science-related literature.

17
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,120
Just next week, we're very excited to welcome renowned

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,480
physicist and Princeton professor Paul J. Steinhart

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,520
for his book, The Second Kind of Impossible.

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,440
And in April, we'll be joined by a biologist and best-selling

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,600
author, Neil Shubin, for his new book, Some Assembly Required.

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,640
If you'd like to stay up to date on the series

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,360
and our newly posted talks, we have a few options.

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,920
Nearly all of our events are filmed and recorded

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,800
for the public.

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,000
You can access them at the web address,

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,880
science.fas.harvard.edu, slash book talks, which I've written

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,160
here on the board.

29
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,720
And also, you can find out announcements

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,840
about our spring lineup at harvard.com slash science.

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,320
And lastly, you can learn about Harvard Bookstore's many other

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,080
non-science book talks, which take place nearly every day

33
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,000
and in and around Harvard Square by visiting us at harvard.com

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,240
and signing up for our weekly email newsletter.

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,640
Tonight's talk will be followed by some time for your questions,

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,160
after which we'll have a book signing and refreshments

37
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,320
in the Cabot Science Library.

38
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,080
If you haven't picked up one already,

39
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,880
we have copies of how language began for sale

40
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,520
at the back of the hall and in the Cabot Library as well.

41
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,680
And as always, a few thank yous.

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,520
Thanks to our partners here at Harvard who make this series

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,280
and, of course, the cheese, all important cheese,

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,120
possible at the reception.

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,920
And thank you to all of you for being here,

46
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,920
for purchasing books that support an independent bookstore

47
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,040
and for affirming that science matters.

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,280
And finally, just a quick reminder, of course,

49
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,720
to silence your cell phones before the talk begins.

50
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,920
And so now I'm so pleased to bring up

51
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,240
Melissa Franklin, Harvard Physics Professor,

52
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,160
and the first woman ever to receive tenure

53
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,960
in the Harvard Physics Department.

54
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,460
Woo!

55
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,800
[? Applause. ?]

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,440
Hi, I'm really excited about this talk.

57
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,640
You know, we have a lot of these science book talks,

58
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,160
but they're mostly physics.

59
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,560
I'm really excited to have something really, we're

60
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,960
branching out, and I'm very excited about tonight's talk.

61
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,800
And if any of you have any ideas about more talks

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,640
on this subject, I see people here I've never seen before.

63
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,440
So I think it's a different audience than the physics

64
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,800
talks, maybe.

65
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,960
Yes?

66
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,480
Yes, OK.

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,680
And so if anybody has any ideas, my name's Franklin at Physics,

68
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,120
just ideas for interesting books in your part of sciencey

69
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,640
things, please let me know.

70
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,520
I want to introduce Daniel Everett, who

71
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,480
has a really interesting past.

72
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,760
And in particular, he started his education

73
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,320
at the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago.

74
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,400
I spent years in Chicago, but I've never

75
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,880
seen the Moody Bible Institute.

76
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,440
It's at La Sal in West Chicago Street.

77
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,920
Nobody's from Chicago.

78
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,000
OK, well, anyway, that's kind of an interesting start.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,680
And from there, he went to Brazil

80
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,400
and got his PhD at the University of Campinas, which

81
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,600
is called Las Campos.

82
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,280
And he did his research also in the South Amazon,

83
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,560
studying the praja in the Amazon basin.

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,520
And now, he taught at a lot of different places.

85
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,800
He taught in Pittsburgh at Manchester,

86
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,800
which I think is in England, not Manchester by the sea,

87
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,520
and at Unicamp, which is also in Brazil.

88
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,880
And he's had many, many interesting positions

89
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,360
of leadership.

90
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,880
In the meantime, he has written many books.

91
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,480
The one I like the best, of course,

92
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,560
is Dark Matter of the Mind, because I'm a physicist.

93
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,080
And that's why, initially, I thought

94
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,280
this would be a good talk in this series.

95
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,440
Dark Matter of the Mind, even though you're linguist,

96
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,520
you know what dark matter is.

97
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,080
Yes, of the mind in the culturally articulated

98
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,720
unconscious.

99
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,200
Another one I like is, don't sleep.

100
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,240
There are snakes, life and language

101
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,080
in the Amazonian jungle, or Amazonian jungle.

102
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,960
The one we're talking about today,

103
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,520
how language began, the story of humanity's greatest

104
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,440
invention, and the one that's coming.

105
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,680
I'm also really excited about American Aristotle,

106
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,960
the life and mind of Charles Sanders Pierce.

107
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,640
There are other books, so you're not going to run out.

108
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,600
I mean, if you start now, and you're under 50,

109
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,480
you could get there.

110
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,320
Just to say, if you don't have the length of attention

111
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,120
for books, there's a fantastic New Yorker profile

112
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,880
on Dr. Everett.

113
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,040
So I'm very excited, because I hear

114
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,640
that it's going to be exciting.

115
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:05,360
Lots of really questions which are probing and questions.

116
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,400
Good probing questions.

117
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,240
So I'm very, very, very excited to welcome Daniel Everett.

118
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,740
Oops.

119
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,080
OK.

120
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,800
So I'll walk around a bit.

121
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,120
I come to Harvard now about once a week, twice a week,

122
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,960
because I'm writing this biography of Charles Sanders

123
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,320
Pierce, who graduated from Harvard in 1859.

124
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,240
When he was going here as a student,

125
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,440
his home set where Seaver Hall currently sits.

126
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,960
Those of you who are familiar with Harvard Yard.

127
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,720
And the person who designed that hall,

128
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,240
H.R. Richardson, was a fellow student of Peirce's

129
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,840
in the 1859 class.

130
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,680
There were eight of them.

131
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,920
And Peirce wrote little summaries of each of them,

132
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,560
said Richardson wasn't very smart.

133
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,920
And he also talked about Strong Vincent, a great American

134
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,800
Civil War hero who died in Gettysburg,

135
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,360
saying that he was a bit flashy and also dull.

136
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,960
Peirce thought everybody was dull.

137
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,160
But he was the first summa cum laude in chemistry

138
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,040
from Harvard.

139
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,480
And he was a geophysicist for 31 years for the US government.

140
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,840
He was an astronomer at Harvard and is mainly

141
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,600
known as a mathematician, logician, and philosopher.

142
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,440
So that's very different from this work,

143
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,720
although you'll see that Peirce is implicated

144
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,000
in the evolution of human language.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,560
So I want to thank several people.

146
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,840
And you can see their names.

147
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,200
So now we'll go to something else.

148
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,360
Not that grateful.

149
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,280
Language is a biocultural behavior.

150
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,600
So language is a biocultural complex.

151
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,000
And thus, research into its origins

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,120
is necessarily interdisciplinary.

153
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,160
And so if you're an archaeologist,

154
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,800
you're not going to find out by yourself how language came

155
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,200
about, and you're not going to do that if you're a linguist.

156
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,600
So it requires a lot of people working together.

157
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,120
And I started on this project by myself,

158
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,280
but have been working quite a bit with archaeologists,

159
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,040
in particular Larry Barham from the University of Liverpool,

160
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,760
whose specialty is Homo erectus.

161
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,560
There are also a lot of different ideas

162
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,760
about what language is.

163
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,240
I'll tell you the right one in a bit.

164
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,200
But language requires to understand

165
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,280
the evolution of language.

166
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,000
We need some archaeology, linguistics, and field

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,880
research on contemporary languages,

168
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,600
semiotics.

169
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,760
That's where Peirce comes in.

170
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,600
Comparative biology, philosophy, cognitive science,

171
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,000
paleo-neuroscience, neuroscience, evolutionary theory,

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,040
and genetics.

173
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,560
So it is quite a daunting task for anyone

174
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,240
to even try to summarize the research that's going on there.

175
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,280
So we could ask the first question we might ask is,

176
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,000
what is language?

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What is it that we think evolved?

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And one view is that language is a grammar,

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,760
is a set of sentences described by a recursive grammar.

180
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,920
That's a very popular definition of it among linguists.

181
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,680
And or the other idea, and the one

182
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,600
I'm going to urge upon you this evening,

183
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,960
is that language is the transfer of information by symbols.

184
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,280
So there is no firm cutoff between humans and other species.

185
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,880
Humans are better at communication by language

186
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,480
than other species are, but it's not

187
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,960
something that is found exclusively in humans.

188
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,240
But I'll try to make that clear.

189
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,720
Who has language?

190
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,560
Well, everything communicates.

191
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,640
If you follow Purse's work, the entire universe is a sign.

192
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,480
Everything is communication.

193
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,440
Minerals communicate.

194
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,960
The trees right now will start communicating

195
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,680
with the environment the shorter days

196
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,600
and start to grow their leaves back.

197
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,560
So everything communicates.

198
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,000
But not everything has language.

199
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,640
Only humans really appear to have language.

200
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,880
And when we talk about other species,

201
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,960
we have to be very careful about what we say about them.

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,120
Relative to humans, to get this right.

203
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,520
So communication, again, is the transfer of information

204
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,800
by signs, which I'll make clearer as we go along.

205
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,400
And language is the transfer of information by symbols.

206
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,680
Symbols that are open-ended and created by people.

207
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,160
Well, they could be created by anybody,

208
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,880
but they just happen to be created by people.

209
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,240
And so there are three types of signs

210
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,440
that are very important to the story.

211
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,320
And two of those are found throughout nature.

212
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,640
Icons and indexes.

213
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,880
An icon is something that resembles something else.

214
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,000
There's some sort of correspondence,

215
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,280
you know, a reflection in the water,

216
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:05,960
or a certain kind of feeling that you get

217
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,720
that corresponds to a particular musical event.

218
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,400
An index is a sign that's connected physically

219
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,840
to what it represents.

220
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,240
So smoke is connected physically to fire.

221
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,520
That's an index of fire.

222
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,440
A footprint is an index of the creature that made it.

223
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,840
Symbols are signs that refer to objects

224
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,080
by convention, habit, or rule.

225
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,760
And to simplify things, I'm simply

226
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,200
going to say that symbols are conventional signs.

227
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,080
They are things that don't have to mean what they mean.

228
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,360
There's no necessary connection to what they mean.

229
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,520
So dog refers to a canine in English, perro in Spanish,

230
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,400
and cachorro in Portuguese.

231
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,560
Neopai in Pideha, these are just conventional things.

232
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,520
They're just physical forms that are conventional

233
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,120
to refer to meanings that are significant in that culture.

234
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,960
So the threshold to productive symbols

235
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,880
was likely fairly sudden, but the evolution of the platforms

236
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,480
for language and symbols took evolutionary time

237
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,560
and are not limited to Homo sapiens.

238
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,760
They don't just get a creature that one day stands up

239
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,320
and starts talking.

240
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,200
We expect to see a lot of correspondence

241
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,360
and a lot of continuity between our species and other species

242
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,640
when we look at communication.

243
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,760
So we find that birds have particular song

244
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,160
dialects, depending on the geographical area they're

245
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,800
found, even in the same species that dolphins communicate,

246
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,640
that chimpanzees and gorillas have fairly interesting

247
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,080
communication systems.

248
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,300
They're not human language, but they're also not totally

249
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,580
unlike human language.

250
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,260
One view is that the view that language is primarily

251
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,820
a former grammar came about in our species and Homo sapiens

252
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,300
about 100,000 to 200,000 years ago.

253
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,260
The alternative view, which I will talk about tonight,

254
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,260
is that language has existed for about 60,000 generations

255
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,540
or more than a million years.

256
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:16,700
So another thing to clarify is that speech is secondary.

257
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,380
The sounds that are coming out of my mouth

258
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,180
are just one way to express language.

259
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,220
It can be expressed by color-coded shapes.

260
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,020
It can be expressed by hand signals.

261
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,180
It can be expressed by mouth signals, by sounds.

262
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,100
And you don't need a lot of speech to have language.

263
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,460
After all, think of the computer.

264
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,820
How many speech sounds does a computer

265
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,060
have, individual things that it can recognize?

266
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,180
Well, it has two, one and zero.

267
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,100
And everything that can be said can be said with ones and zeros.

268
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,700
Computers have better memories, in some respects, than we do.

269
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,020
So they can remember and distinguish longer sequences.

270
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,780
So we tend to have more than just two symbols.

271
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,980
Actually, you could have just one symbol and have a language.

272
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,140
Because you could have ah means tree, and ah means by the tree,

273
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,820
and ah means over there by the tree, or something like that.

274
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,860
But that's hard to remember.

275
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,180
So those systems don't tend to do too well.

276
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,020
In fact, I don't know of any languages like that.

277
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,860
The smallest system that I'm aware of

278
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,260
is Pidaha, which has eight consonants if you're a man,

279
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,980
seven consonants if you're a woman, and three vowels.

280
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,900
And it also has two tones, which is something

281
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,260
when we talk about the evolution of speech,

282
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,460
we sometimes forget that there are tone languages

283
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,180
and that people can distinguish words by tones,

284
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,820
rather than just by consonants and vowels.

285
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,300
There's some evidence, some people,

286
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,780
to come to Fitch, for example, as a biologist at the University

287
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,540
of Vienna, thinks that early species of humans

288
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,100
had full speech capabilities.

289
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,700
In fact, he argues that non-human species

290
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,860
have full speech capabilities.

291
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,580
The answer is it doesn't really matter that much

292
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,260
because language is not about speech,

293
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,260
it is about symbols and transfer of information by symbols.

294
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,820
However, so if you talk about the components

295
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,900
of all languages, so every language in the world

296
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,820
has the three vowels, i, a, u.

297
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,100
And I tell you that Pidaha only has three vowels.

298
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,300
If you're a linguist, you can guess that those vowels

299
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,460
are i, a, u, because every language has those vowels.

300
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,100
Those are called the quantal vowels.

301
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,900
They're just the easiest to hear.

302
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,660
In fact, they're so important that,

303
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,180
according to Phil Lieberman, who's son Daniel,

304
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,420
I believe, teaches here, has argued

305
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,020
that the entire evolution of the tongue in the human mouth

306
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,260
is to be able to produce those vowels.

307
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,740
They're that important and they help distinguish

308
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,140
the speech of all languages.

309
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,060
Did they come later?

310
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,980
Well, according to Fitch and others,

311
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,380
they didn't come later, but according to work

312
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,380
by Jeffrey Leitman and Phil Lieberman,

313
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,540
but especially Jeffrey Leitman's work,

314
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,260
there is a rapid evolution in the vocal apparatus

315
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,540
starting about the time of Homo erectus,

316
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,540
which would be explained if that's when language started.

317
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,100
They would need better speech to communicate with language,

318
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,180
although you don't have to make clear sounds to have language.

319
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,340
You can have garbled speech and it's still language.

320
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,500
It's like getting a Model T Ford.

321
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,820
Is that a car?

322
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,660
Yes, it is.

323
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,300
It's not a Ferrari, but it's a Model T.

324
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,020
So we didn't start off necessarily

325
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,180
with the full capabilities that we have today,

326
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,980
but we had enough speech to get by.

327
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,780
There are a lot of external conditions

328
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,820
on human speech evolution.

329
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,460
So work by Damian Blasey and Sean Rogers and Caleb Everett,

330
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,580
who not coincidentally shares my name,

331
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,460
all argue for exocentric factors

332
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,180
affecting the evolution of speech.

333
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,460
Anyway, our hero is Homo erectus.

334
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,420
I'm sure that he or she looked just like this.

335
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,420
I was very, I'm always intrigued to discover new findings

336
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,260
in the literature about the accomplishments

337
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,780
of Homo erectus because we tend

338
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,740
to really downgrade Homo erectus.

339
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,100
You know, if you remember, if you're old enough

340
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,780
to remember the American comedian Rodney Dangerfield,

341
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,980
you know his line is, I don't get no respect.

342
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,740
That's how I feel about Homo erectus at times.

343
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,900
Everybody's impressed with the latest artwork

344
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,700
from Neanderthals or Sapiens,

345
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,740
but erectus is really where it all started.

346
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,540
And in fact, in recent study published,

347
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,940
there's been some news about it in the last couple of days,

348
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,140
it was discovered that Homo sapiens,

349
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,140
modern Homo sapiens in Africa have DNA evidence

350
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,380
that shows that they interbred with a Homo species

351
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,700
that existed prior to the split of Neanderthals and Sapiens.

352
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,100
Well, that's Homo erectus.

353
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,540
They didn't mate with chimpanzees and gorillas,

354
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,500
as far as we know, they had to see a certain amount

355
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,140
of similarity between themselves and erectus,

356
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,820
almost certainly, and there would have done that.

357
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,340
Homo sapiens and erectus co-existed for many years together.

358
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,180
In fact, Homo erectus is the most successful species

359
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,340
in the history of our genus Homo.

360
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,940
So they existed from 1.8 million years ago

361
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,020
to about 140,000 years ago,

362
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,220
some would say even more recently.

363
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,940
They're far more successful than we are,

364
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,500
they existed well over a million years longer

365
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,780
than Homo sapiens has existed.

366
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,500
Their height was between 5'8 and 5'11,

367
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,740
so they weren't little Australopithecines,

368
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,300
they were big guys, they had big bones,

369
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,220
they could have pretty much taken

370
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,940
on any Homo sapiens walking around.

371
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,300
They were wide-ranging polymorphic species,

372
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,700
they had a lot of variation in skull size

373
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,060
and in physical strength,

374
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,420
and they arguably did possess a modern vocal apparatus,

375
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,220
from what we can tell from the,

376
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,780
it's very difficult to find the small little bones

377
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,020
that define a modern vocal apparatus,

378
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,820
but in recent work there has been discoveries

379
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,980
of what appear to be hyoid bones

380
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,780
that belong to Homo erectus,

381
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,500
which would have meant that they had

382
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,940
fairly modern speech capabilities.

383
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,660
They were ocean travelers,

384
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,980
magnificent tool makers,

385
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,380
they invented fire, they started communities.

386
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,060
Much of what we take for granted

387
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,860
as human accomplishments are human accomplishments,

388
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,500
they're just from a non-sapien species of human.

389
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,780
So there are gradualist versus saltationist views

390
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,340
of language origin, so did language come about gradually

391
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,380
or just pop into being?

392
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,300
I think it came about gradually,

393
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,700
just to set the groundwork.

394
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,460
Is language uniquely human or non-unique human set

395
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,020
of abilities shared with other animals?

396
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,620
Descartes, who was very good mathematician,

397
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,020
but an extremely poor philosopher,

398
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,260
Charles Sanders Purse in fact has all sorts of sections

399
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,660
about why Descartes was a bumbling idiot,

400
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,260
but of course Charles thought that about many people,

401
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,780
but he severely attacks all of Cartesian philosophy,

402
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,180
but one of the interesting distinctions of course

403
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,860
is that Descartes felt that only humans had cognition

404
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,540
and that other animals were basically meat machines.

405
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,980
They were just, you didn't need to be kind to animals

406
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,140
or worry about them because they had no consciousness,

407
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,660
they had no brains, they had brains but no minds

408
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,700
because dualism comes from Descartes in modern times.

409
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,260
So there's a very different view from Descartes.

410
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,500
This is the view that we are just continuous

411
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,220
in nature, humans are just animals like others,

412
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,980
shouldn't be a shock for people these days,

413
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,140
although it is a shock for many linguists

414
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,420
to think in those terms.

415
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,980
So the evolution of the brain,

416
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,940
how big was Homo erectus' brain and what does it matter?

417
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,980
Their average brain size was about 950 cc's

418
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,900
whereas Neanderthals brain was about 1,400 cc's

419
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,900
and a modern human's brain is about 1,250 to 1,300 cc's

420
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,060
although many modern European females

421
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,780
have brains in the size range of Homo erectus,

422
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:49,780
about 950 cc's and as people who study the brain

423
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,700
have come to realize size doesn't matter so much.

424
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,820
But you can find, you can see the ranges here,

425
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,100
the circle is where we find most of the Homo erectus'

426
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,820
brain sizes but you also find some sapiens in there

427
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,340
and Neanderthals and as you go out towards

428
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,340
the upper edges of the chart you do start to get

429
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,860
into fairly sapiens exclusive territory

430
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,140
but just remembering that we don't fully understand

431
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,060
the brain that's putting it mildly

432
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,460
and so the main thing that matters

433
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,820
is the organization of the brain

434
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,300
and that's extremely difficult to tell with fossils

435
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,300
how their brains were organized.

436
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,820
So human ancestry is represented in this chart

437
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,580
with erectus at the bottom, maybe Floresiensis

438
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,740
who was from the islands of Flores,

439
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,540
this sometimes called the hobbit little creature

440
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,100
who was over there, according to some linguists

441
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,980
there are still stories about them told

442
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,100
by the indigenous peoples, I don't think that's probably

443
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,500
right but they do have stories about little creatures

444
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,540
running around through the jungles.

445
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,540
But from erectus came all the other creatures

446
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:05,100
that are related to us, all the other 20 or so species

447
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,940
of Homo but erectus was the first.

448
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,500
Now where does Charles Sanders' purse come in?

449
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,540
He was by the way banned from Harvard

450
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,620
so it's really interesting that his papers

451
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,300
are here at Harvard then one has to come here

452
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,860
to study purse because Charles Elliot

453
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,140
who was president at the time didn't want him on campus

454
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:31,140
because he was seen coming out of a hotel

455
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,220
with a woman who wasn't his wife so he lost his job

456
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,860
at Johns Hopkins University and that was the only job

457
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,700
he ever had in academics and he was banned

458
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,620
from the Harvard campus even though his brother

459
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,820
was the dean of mathematics and his father

460
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,740
had been professor of mathematics for 50 years here anyway.

461
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,900
So he was the one who invented for the very first time,

462
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,980
first and second order logic.

463
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,740
That's credit is often given to Gottlieb Frege

464
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,460
but in fact, purse had it worked out in some ways

465
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,460
before Frege and independently about the same time.

466
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,660
He invented semiotics, the theory of science before Sosir.

467
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,460
He invented pragmatism from William James.

468
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,220
There's actually an interesting correspondence

469
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,040
between purse and James.

470
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,340
Purse was a member of the National Academy of Sciences

471
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,660
and he was explaining to James why he could not nominate him

472
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,740
for membership in the National Academy of Sciences

473
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,660
because most scientists took James.

474
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,540
He said, we consider you a literary man,

475
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,980
not a real scientist.

476
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,100
But James got famous for the idea of pragmatism

477
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,140
although the idea comes from purse.

478
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,460
At the time that he was alive,

479
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,980
he was considered America's greatest mathematician.

480
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,820
The German mathematician Ernest Schroeder wrote him

481
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,280
and said that your genius and your reputation

482
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,620
shall shine like the sun for eons into the future

483
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,260
which clearly was wrong but he was a brilliant

484
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,180
mathematician.

485
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,820
He made fundamental discoveries in mathematics.

486
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,300
He was the first person to link the absolute length

487
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,980
of a meter to a wavelength of light for measurements.

488
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,100
He took over 20 different places in the globe.

489
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,660
His only book he ever wrote was on the physical properties

490
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:17,660
of light, photometric researches and he's the first person

491
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,220
to notice that the Milky Way rotated,

492
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,420
all sorts of things he did in his spare time.

493
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,380
And as I will argue in the biography about purse,

494
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,260
he was the inventor of cognitive science

495
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,620
as we know it, sort of as we know it today.

496
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,420
Anyway, this is purse as a young man here.

497
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,900
He was an interesting guy.

498
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,420
I'm gonna skip this and go on to culture

499
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,580
because culture really is the important thing here.

500
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,540
You can't have a language unless you have a culture

501
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,100
and you can't have a culture unless you have a language.

502
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,180
They're symbiotically related.

503
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,960
Each determines or constrains and leads to the conditions

504
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,340
to develop the other.

505
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,420
So in my definition, culture is an abstract network,

506
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,820
shaping and connecting social roles,

507
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,260
hierarchically structured knowledge domains

508
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,900
and ranked values.

509
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,420
So ranked values are very important to culture.

510
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,900
So it's not enough to know that people

511
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,740
have the same values.

512
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,660
So for example, if you're French,

513
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,260
you might think that good food is very important

514
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,580
and that being in good shape is also very important.

515
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,460
And if you're from, say, Houston, Texas,

516
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,380
you may believe the same things.

517
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,460
But if you think that good food is more important

518
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,780
than being in shape, you'll look one way.

519
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,300
And if you think that being in shape is more important

520
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,780
than good food, you'll look another way.

521
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,860
So the value rankings are as important or more important

522
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,140
than the actual values themselves.

523
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,740
Culture is always shifting.

524
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:50,380
So universal grammar is a very popular term.

525
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,740
It was made popular in modern times by Noam Chomsky.

526
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,660
Although the term goes back to the 12th century,

527
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,580
grammarians known as the modesty.

528
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,820
And in the US, the first person to ever talk about universal

529
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,380
grammar was Charles Sanders Purse.

530
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,780
His view of grammar was both he and Chomsky, interestingly

531
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,020
enough, felt that recursion, I can

532
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,780
talk about recursion separately, but anyway, they thought

533
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,020
that recursion was the basis of grammar.

534
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,060
But for Purse, it was meaning, recursive meanings, not forms,

535
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,140
not the sentences.

536
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,660
But the way that, so for example, if I say bachelor,

537
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:33,100
I have to interpret that in terms of, say, unmarried man.

538
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,780
And I interpret unmarried in terms of other symbols.

539
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,260
And I interpret man in terms of other symbols

540
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,020
so that every symbol starts us to a recursive chain that

541
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,340
has no end.

542
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,380
Everything is connected.

543
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,940
And to understand one thing, we have to understand a great

544
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,980
deal of culture.

545
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:56,060
So the difference is for Purse universal grammar followed

546
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,180
from logical principles.

547
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,660
There was nothing necessarily genetic about it.

548
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,740
It simply followed from logical principles.

549
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,620
If you had symbols, they were subject to certain logical

550
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,140
constraints, and those would affect the form of the

551
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,540
language.

552
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,060
Whereas the second version of universal grammar, Chomsky's

553
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:20,220
is that not only is human biology responsible for

554
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,620
underwriting human linguistic capacity, but the genes are,

555
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,580
there are specific genes linked to language.

556
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,860
So those are very different views of universal grammar.

557
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,260
So now let's move on to tools.

558
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,260
Tools turn out to be a very important part of reasoning

559
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,460
about the origins of human language.

560
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,420
Tools are individual devices or processes that meet perceived

561
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,900
needs of individuals and communities, or a set of

562
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,780
devices, processes, and expertise used to harness the

563
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,460
properties of a particular material.

564
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,540
Full culturally constructed repertoire of knowledge,

565
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,940
conventions, devices, and processes.

566
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,900
Values are vital at each stage.

567
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,540
So tools are really complicated.

568
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,740
This is clearly a complicated tool.

569
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,980
But so is a shovel.

570
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,980
A shovel has a specific kind of function, and if you make a

571
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,820
shovel out of rubber, it won't work very well.

572
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,300
So there's a whole lot of things that have to go into a tool

573
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,340
as simple as a shovel or a knife to make it be what it is.

574
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,100
And it starts to take on meaning features that go

575
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,060
beyond its function.

576
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,820
Human technology enmeshes the material with the ideational.

577
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:40,540
We have ideas, and they're manifested materially.

578
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,900
Tools involve social constructivism.

579
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,900
Tools become symbols as they emerge from the values,

580
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,060
knowledge, structures, and social roles of a particular

581
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,140
culture.

582
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,380
Symbolism in erectus tools is therefore crucial evidence.

583
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,620
So that's one thing we really need to look for in addition

584
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,300
to the other accomplishments of erectus.

585
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,540
Now, it's true that other species have tools.

586
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:07,460
But other species' tools tend to be opportunistic.

587
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,500
And one of the interesting things, for example, about

588
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,060
erectus is that they took very good care of their tools.

589
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,020
They colored their tools.

590
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,660
They carried their tools with them over long distances.

591
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,500
They planned ahead.

592
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,420
No other species is known to do that.

593
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,620
Although it's a good Darwinian, I wouldn't want to say that

594
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,740
no other species could, you know, I wouldn't want to

595
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,300
predict what no other species could do.

596
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,540
Because every time somebody tries to do that, we find

597
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,820
that they can.

598
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,140
Learning of technical skills takes place using a

599
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,660
combination of language, gesture, imitation, and

600
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,660
guided intervention.

601
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,220
This applies to all erectus, neanderthal, ensus, and

602
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,500
sapiens tools.

603
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,100
And we'll be getting to that.

604
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,980
This is partially based on lab experiments with stone tool

605
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,540
users.

606
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,020
And my experience in the Amazon, I see this too.

607
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:55,420
So at the many archaeology departments, they have

608
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:01,740
napping labs, K, N, A, P, P, not N, A, P. And they learn to

609
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,420
make stone tools.

610
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,020
Graduate students learn to make stone tools.

611
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,540
And they bruise their hands.

612
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,340
They cut their hands.

613
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,700
It's really hard.

614
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,420
So the simplest form of stone tool is like the older one

615
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,260
tools, which we'll see a picture of.

616
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,900
Those take a couple of hundred hours very often for

617
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,780
students, PhD students, to learn to make accurately.

618
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,980
When we get into the more complex tools, it takes a

619
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,740
lot longer.

620
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,060
And what people have found in these labs is that even the

621
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:32,100
simplest tools, it's very hard to simply show by example how

622
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,940
to do it.

623
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:38,580
Language tends to be implicated in this skill

624
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,220
acquisition.

625
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,380
Now, this could simply be because they're sapiens, right?

626
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,180
And sapiens talk.

627
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,860
So why not avail yourself of the speech that you have?

628
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:51,500
In the Amazon, I have watched many men teach their sons

629
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,180
how to make tools like blowguns and bows and arrows.

630
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,940
And a lot of the time is in silence.

631
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,340
But then you'll often hear a question and an answer about

632
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,140
something that was very difficult to see or a movement

633
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,020
that was very quick.

634
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:12,060
So tools take explanation in many cases.

635
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,860
So once again, on a sign, a sign refers to an object.

636
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:21,580
So if I have a sign, if I say water, that's the object.

637
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,540
And the representation is W-A-T-E-R.

638
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,700
And the interpretation that you're going to make is

639
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,700
something to drink.

640
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,740
So icons, their physical resemblance, correspondence,

641
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,540
they don't tend to have much intentionality about them.

642
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,660
A reflection in the water is there, whether you intended

643
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,500
it to be there or not.

644
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,260
But they can last after a reflection.

645
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,420
But they can last after someone's not there.

646
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:53,340
So the smell of a footprint can last for quite a while.

647
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,820
All animals are able to interpret indexes.

648
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,980
In fact, when we talk about animals'

649
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,660
interpretation abilities, almost all the time in the

650
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,180
experiments when they're talking about animals' learning

651
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,660
symbols, in the Persian sense, they're not learning symbols.

652
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,740
They're learning indexes and icons, which are very

653
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,820
different levels of cognitive

654
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,580
accomplishment from symbols.

655
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,620
And so symbols are the final ones.

656
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,460
And these are the properties that are important for us.

657
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,780
No symbols, no language.

658
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,420
They involve displacement.

659
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,660
The thing that we're talking about doesn't actually have

660
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,740
to be there.

661
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,180
I can say water and hold this up, or I can say water

662
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:30,820
without it there.

663
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,460
And you still know what I'm talking about, that the

664
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,460
object doesn't actually have to be there.

665
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,900
Indexes last a long time.

666
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,140
These footprints are about 3.7 million years old, found by

667
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:44,820
Mary Leakey in, they're called the Laetoli footprints.

668
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,820
And if you follow them out, you can see that it's a large

669
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,660
Australopithesis probably, Australopithecus walking with

670
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,780
a small one, and they walk, and they turn and look at

671
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,980
something, and then they walk on.

672
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,620
And it rained after they had walked by, and this is volcanic

673
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,820
ash that hardened like concrete and left their

674
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,620
footprints there.

675
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,460
This is Australopithecus africanus.

676
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,420
And as far as we can tell, they're the first creature to

677
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,620
ever preserve an icon.

678
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:16,980
So they're starting to look at things and contemplate, I

679
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,460
don't think that's too strong a word,

680
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,740
contemplate the similarities.

681
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,740
So this stone, which is about 3 million years old, is called

682
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,140
the Makapansgat pebble.

683
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,860
It was found in a cave in South Africa, and it's unlike

684
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:33,780
the material that the other stones in the cave were from.

685
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,180
And if you look at it, it has an interesting characteristic.

686
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,900
It looks like a smiley face.

687
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,740
And this thing is about 3 inches by 2 inches, so it's too

688
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,780
big to have gotten caught between their toes and carried

689
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,900
up there coincidentally.

690
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,540
This seems to be something that Australopithecus and

691
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,420
Australopithecus found interesting and carried up to

692
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:01,140
the cave with no particular functional role other than it

693
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,100
looked like a face.

694
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,300
Australopithecines also made tools.

695
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,540
They're tools about 3.3 million years old, found in

696
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,300
different places.

697
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,340
They're the Oldowan tools discovered initially by the

698
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,220
Leakey family.

699
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,740
Icons are all over the place.

700
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,180
In addition to seeing icons in nature, we have them in

701
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,420
churches, and here are tools that have been actually made

702
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,300
into icons and symbols, both.

703
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,420
And from symbols to grammar, so how complex does a

704
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,300
grammar have to be?

705
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,340
Everybody will agree, every linguist will agree that you

706
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,900
can't have a language until you have a grammar.

707
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,220
But how complex does the grammar have to be?

708
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,700
Well, there are a couple of different possibilities.

709
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,500
And one of the points that I make in the book is that we

710
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,860
find all of these in the world today.

711
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:00,060
So one we could call a G1 grammar, which is just words

712
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,220
put in a linear order.

713
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:06,940
And that seems to be the case, for example, in Peta Ha and

714
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,100
Riau, which is a language of New Guinea, which is

715
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,060
John Saul Mary.

716
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,100
So there's no other structure, let's say, in a

717
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:15,820
language like this.

718
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:20,140
There's just those three words, John Saul Mary.

719
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:25,500
A G2 grammar would be like a G1 grammar, but have additional

720
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,620
hierarchy or structure into the phrases.

721
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:34,140
So the man you saw yesterday is here, where you saw

722
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:40,180
yesterday as a sentence hierarchically located inside

723
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:44,940
a larger sentence, or you could simply say the very big

724
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,220
ball rolled down the hill.

725
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,860
There you start to get more structure.

726
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,660
It's not simply linear order of words.

727
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,980
A G3 grammar has both recursion and hierarchy.

728
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,300
So what is recursion?

729
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,260
It's the ability to put one thing inside another of the

730
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,020
same type and just keep doing it.

731
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:08,340
So the man who is here said that Bill said that Mary said

732
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,180
that Peter said that John bought a house.

733
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,180
When you start to get structures like that so that

734
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,340
you can say there's no longer a sentence in a language, then

735
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,140
recursion is the best way to handle that.

736
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,180
And recursion is communicatively very useful.

737
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,260
You can pack a lot more information in a

738
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,340
sentence with recursion.

739
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,740
But I've argued that although recursion can be found in any

740
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,980
language, it's not a necessary component of all languages.

741
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,140
And in fact, there are good reasons why some

742
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,500
languages would avoid it.

743
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,820
So erectus had icons.

744
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,500
We know that they carry things around.

745
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,940
They didn't carry around smiley faces that we know of, but

746
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:51,300
they did carry around phallic symbols like this cuttlefish

747
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:57,620
bone that was found in Morocco about 450,000 years ago.

748
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:02,980
And erectus also started making quite complex tools.

749
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,460
So there are three grades of tools in the paleolithic,

750
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,460
especially in the lower paleolithic.

751
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,940
There are oldivon tools about 3 million years ago.

752
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,020
There are achulian tools made as recently as 200,000 years

753
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,820
ago.

754
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,980
And then finally, there are levelwa tools, which are the

755
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,060
most complex tools found in the paleolithic.

756
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,180
So these are refined, which means they've been thinned.

757
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:32,140
These take quite a bit of effort and skill to function.

758
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,700
And they have various parts to them.

759
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,580
You don't just start off banging two rocks together to

760
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,260
get one of those.

761
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,780
You have to have a plan.

762
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,620
There are certain things that have to be cut out of the tool.

763
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,100
It has to have a certain shape to be functional.

764
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,220
So when erectus started working on tools, they might

765
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,700
start with a large piece of rock.

766
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,900
And out of that, they had to break out the pieces that

767
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,220
they needed to get the kind of functional tool.

768
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:02,780
And they make them all pretty much the same to work for them.

769
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,140
Erectus was the first to come up with a controlled use of

770
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,140
fire.

771
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,540
The pre-shaping of stone tools, working them before they

772
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,980
actually started chiseling out the tools, they used wood and

773
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,580
bone tools as well.

774
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,180
And we think they might have also used hafted tools.

775
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,820
And hafted tools are quite important because that's when

776
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,140
you tie a handle on that shows a lot of functional

777
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,500
improvement over others.

778
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,020
And it shows a lot of foresight and planning.

779
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:35,620
So these tools had a great deal of complexity over

780
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,420
hundreds of thousands of years.

781
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:43,340
And in recent research in modern-day Ghana, Larry

782
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,500
Barham has discovered about 900,000-year-old tools that

783
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,820
seem to have been dyed with ochre.

784
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,340
That's a significant finding because dyeing tools shows

785
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:59,380
that that's not simply a functional aspect of toolmaking.

786
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,340
That is an aspect of toolmaking that shows thought

787
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,140
that goes above the mere function of the tool.

788
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,780
Hafting tools, combinatorial thinking, imagining the

789
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,660
future, and likely invented by erectus.

790
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,620
It's one of the most significant technological

791
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,220
breakthroughs in human toolmaking.

792
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,340
And ochre is also very important.

793
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,420
And we see things like hand axes.

794
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,980
They had a tool kit, not nearly as extensive as an

795
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,260
Neanderthal tool kit or as a Homo sapiens tool kit, but as

796
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,820
an extensive tool kit.

797
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,700
They had hand axes and cleavers.

798
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,540
They had picks.

799
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,180
And so we see different stages.

800
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,980
We should recall the simple stage of Oldowan tools that we

801
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,860
saw that Australopithecus had.

802
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,500
We see achulian tools.

803
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,060
These are already starting to get refined and showing a lot

804
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,340
more work.

805
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,860
And then we get to the Cadillac of the tools of

806
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,420
erectus-level-wa tools.

807
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,220
Not everyone agrees that erectus-made-level-wa tools.

808
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:11,900
Some are dated as early as 625,000 BC.

809
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,900
But not everyone agrees with those dates.

810
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,980
The dates that do have the widest agreement are about

811
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,740
300,000 years ago.

812
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,900
That would mean that they could have been used by

813
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,420
Neanderthals or sapiens or erectus.

814
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,740
So it's difficult to limit them exclusively to erectus.

815
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,820
However, a million years ago, we see larger tools that are

816
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,300
made with the same way that level-wa tools are made.

817
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:43,220
Level-wa tools require a lot of hammer work before the

818
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,900
final stage, which is lifting the core out of the larger

819
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,780
tool.

820
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,700
And that takes a lot of planning, a lot of discussion,

821
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,020
or a lot of skill.

822
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:58,860
And many of the people who study the tools, a fairly wide

823
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,980
consensus, is that level-wa tools can't be learned by

824
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,020
imitation alone.

825
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,620
There has to be linguistic instruction when we get to

826
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,740
this level of tool complexity.

827
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:14,620
And these tools were, in fact, found as early as a million

828
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:18,380
years ago tools that were made by the same process.

829
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,820
Not everyone would call them by the same name, but they

830
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,940
were made by the same process.

831
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,460
So every tool that was made had to have various

832
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,540
functional features.

833
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:31,020
So if we find tools that have nothing but functional

834
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:35,220
features, it's difficult to see anything symbolic in that.

835
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,820
We can say of any tool that it's an index of the task to

836
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,100
be performed, it's an icon of other tools.

837
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,580
You have one tool as a model to make another tool.

838
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:51,300
So it does represent a growth in signification.

839
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,420
But to get to the level of symbols, we need to see

840
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,500
things that aren't simply part of the function.

841
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,020
And we start to see some of this at the end of the

842
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,980
Acheulean age.

843
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:06,020
We see tools that are made a little bit more elaborately

844
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,140
than they need to be made.

845
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,940
They're painted, they're dyed.

846
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,940
And in fact, when Larry and I were working on some tools

847
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:19,180
that he had just brought back from Africa this past summer,

848
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:23,500
another expert on erectus tools walked into his lab at

849
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,020
Liverpool and said, oh, those are from East Africa.

850
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:32,620
Because apparently East African and West African erectus

851
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,540
designed their tools in different ways.

852
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,540
So the design of the tools was representative of the group

853
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,900
that they came from.

854
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,940
They indicated robustness.

855
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,540
One of the earliest ideas when they started to find these

856
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,300
non-functional aspects of erectus tools was that it was

857
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,660
men showing off for women, making the tools to show that

858
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,740
they were better tool makers.

859
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,580
But of course, we have no idea whether it was men who made

860
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,660
the tools or women who made the tools.

861
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,500
So we don't know.

862
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,380
There was somebody who was probably showing off, but we

863
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,940
don't know who was showing off.

864
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,860
But then we find really interesting things about

865
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:11,460
erectus that are difficult to explain.

866
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,620
And we find that, so this shell is 750,000 years old.

867
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,140
And the markings on this shell were done in Java by a

868
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:25,380
homo erectus using a shark tooth on this large shell.

869
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,020
And the marks were made without ever picking up the shark

870
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:32,340
tooth, their constant continuous representation.

871
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,740
And we start to see a lot of this kind of thing with

872
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:39,100
erectus, this kind of attempt to represent things such as

873
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:39,980
this rock.

874
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,580
We find these geometric shapes that erectus is starting to

875
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,340
carve into shells and into tools so that we realize that

876
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,900
erectus is starting to see things beyond their mere

877
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,260
functionality.

878
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:57,860
And then about 250,000 years ago, we find this Venus of

879
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,980
Barakat Ram, which is in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem,

880
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:08,500
which has got red ochre on it, partially formed by humans,

881
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,940
partially formed by nature.

882
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,460
But it's the first real artwork that we know about.

883
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,300
There are others about the same time.

884
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,460
And it does seem to have been made by erectus.

885
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:24,220
So erectus tools, they have symbolic and social components.

886
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,220
They go beyond the functionally necessary.

887
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,220
They go into style.

888
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,460
They represent one tradition over another.

889
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,300
They're beyond icons and indexes.

890
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,740
They're simultaneously indexes of task, icons of other

891
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,980
tools, and symbols of the values and labor of the

892
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,540
community.

893
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:44,300
Symbols in linear order simply turn out to be language.

894
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,780
As soon as you can start symbolizing things, you have

895
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,660
the ingredients that are necessary for language.

896
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,220
So if they had language, what other things did they do that

897
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,140
might have shown that they had language?

898
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,540
So the tools show us that they had the ability to symbolize

899
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,180
and this would have been a cognitive

900
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,900
breakthrough for language.

901
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,180
But is there any other evidence?

902
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,780
Well, it turns out that there are.

903
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,180
But let's talk about how you get to modern languages from

904
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,380
just a few symbols.

905
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,060
Most things are enhancements.

906
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,300
So we add things.

907
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,740
So you have language systems that decide what they're

908
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,540
going to represent.

909
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,020
What is it that you want to talk about?

910
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:26,460
So among the pita ha, for example, there are no numbers.

911
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,460
There are no color words.

912
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,900
They don't have the number one.

913
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,980
Does this mean that they're cognitively deficient?

914
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,620
Well, they also don't have golf clubs.

915
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,340
There are a lot of things they don't have and a lot of

916
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,220
things we don't have.

917
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,900
How many men in here know how to make a good bow and arrow?

918
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,020
They produce what their culture needs.

919
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,740
Their culture doesn't need numbers.

920
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,740
They don't have numbers.

921
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:50,180
And this has been verified with a lot of experiments over

922
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,060
the years.

923
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,220
So they also don't represent tense, but they don't have

924
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,380
past tense or present tense or future tense.

925
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,220
But they have a lot of ways of distinguishing different

926
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,260
perspectives on how an action takes place, whether it took

927
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,620
place at a certain height, whether it took place near

928
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,740
the river.

929
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,660
So they build into their verbs.

930
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,380
How many verb forms does English have?

931
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,940
It's pretty poor.

932
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,180
Five, sing, sing, sung, singing, sings.

933
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:18,660
That's it.

934
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,820
You've exhausted the entire word grammar of English with

935
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:23,660
those.

936
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,980
But if you go on to Spanish or Portuguese, you'll get 30 to

937
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,060
50 types of verbs.

938
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:34,100
But in Pida ha, since there are 16 suffixes possible, you

939
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,900
have two to the 16 possible verb forms, which is about

940
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,260
65,000 verb forms.

941
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,060
So their grammar is not like ours.

942
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:47,140
It has very complex verbs, but simple in other ways

943
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,740
compared to us.

944
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,620
It's what a culture decides to represent that starts to work

945
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,100
its way into the language.

946
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,580
Conceptual systems, how do we interpret these things?

947
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,940
Do we interpret these things strictly based on the symbols

948
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:01,420
we see?

949
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,900
Do we interpret them based on other cultural nuances?

950
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,260
And these all start to form part of the language and enter

951
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,780
the language in different ways.

952
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,420
Linguistic systems will have different rules, different

953
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,300
structures, different constraints.

954
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:21,140
So this shows that language has at least these major

955
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,300
components, the objects, the ways they're interpreted, and

956
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,340
the forms that we choose to represent them in.

957
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,500
And languages differ a lot.

958
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,500
So if I say yesterday, what did John give to Mary in the

959
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,380
library, there's intonation.

960
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:38,940
My pitch is modulated, depending on whether it's a

961
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,220
question or a statement.

962
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,500
And these are add-ons to make things clear.

963
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,740
It's not necessary to have this intuition to distinguish

964
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,700
questions from statements, but it is very, very useful.

965
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,780
In Piedahá, like many of the world's languages, probably

966
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,780
close to half of the world's languages, such as Chinese and

967
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,780
Korean and others, the language is tonal.

968
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,460
So the word for ear in Piedahá is awe.

969
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,180
And the word for foreigner is awe.

970
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,180
And the word for skin is awe.

971
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,860
And the word for Brazilian shell is awe.

972
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:13,460
And the word for hand is awe.

973
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:21,300
So if I whistled it, and those are all very important in

974
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:21,660
Piedahá.

975
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,540
So you've got to be able to hear those tonal distinctions.

976
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,620
But obviously, tone's not necessary, because we don't

977
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:28,380
have it in English.

978
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:31,700
And although English may not be as attractive sounding as

979
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,860
Piedahá, it still seems to work.

980
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,900
So there are all sorts of things we can add.

981
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,300
Once we get symbols, there are all ways that we can embellish

982
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,500
them with sound structures and the kinds of syllables we use,

983
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,980
the way we organize things.

984
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,740
And then we start to think about how languages

985
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,380
represented in the brain.

986
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:54,220
And in the work of Evelina Fedorenko at MIT's Brain and

987
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:59,460
Cognitive Sciences Department, she's found that languages,

988
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,420
not at all, found in just one part of the brain, as people

989
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,860
thought for many years, but that it's distributed

990
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:09,140
throughout the brain in what she calls a language network.

991
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:14,220
And that this network is fairly similar across all languages

992
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,660
and across all people.

993
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,140
But it's a lot more complicated than simply saying it's in

994
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,900
Broca's area, if you've heard of that area, or

995
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,180
Vernike's area.

996
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,700
Actually, the interesting thing about Broca's patient is

997
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:29,300
the part of his brain that was damaged was not Broca's area.

998
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:35,820
But simplistic views of where language is found in the brain

999
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,500
are being challenged every day by more research.

1000
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:45,620
So there are various ways that we enhance grammar in morphemes,

1001
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:49,820
our little parts of words, like the 65,000 Piedoha word forms.

1002
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,500
There are phrases, sentences, paragraphs, discourses,

1003
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,340
conversations.

1004
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:57,780
All of these are important, and they occur naturally over time.

1005
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,380
The interesting thing about language, although it's very

1006
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,780
complicated, once we start to look at a finished system, we

1007
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,660
can see that its components are relatively simple and build up

1008
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:11,580
over time, and that the core component to every aspect of

1009
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,780
the language that's been built up is the symbol.

1010
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,220
So what else did erectus do?

1011
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:21,500
Well, just under two million years ago, they were spread

1012
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,020
out across the world.

1013
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:26,260
That we find them in Beijing, we find them in Iran, we find

1014
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,260
them in various parts of the world.

1015
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,180
We find erectus.

1016
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:34,780
There were still many in Africa, and so they were traveling.

1017
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:40,980
And we find a 790,000-year-old settlement in Israel,

1018
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,620
Geshe Benoit Yaakov.

1019
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,860
And in there, we find the controlled use of fire,

1020
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:52,420
specialized spaces, various components that show, for

1021
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:56,860
example, separate areas of the settlement are used for

1022
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,300
processing meat, processing fish, processing plant, what

1023
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,140
seem to be communal areas.

1024
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:07,660
So erectus did seem to have the ability to have an

1025
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,540
organized society.

1026
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:13,500
There's evidence that their society was organized.

1027
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,820
And this is found in this ongoing work in Israel and

1028
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,580
other places.

1029
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:21,100
This is found where the black dot is, is an erectus

1030
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,380
settlement in Israel.

1031
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,020
There are a lot of interesting archaic human sites in the

1032
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,860
Middle East, in Israel, and other places.

1033
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,220
Because if you're coming out of Africa at the time they were

1034
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:34,900
coming out, because the Sahara Desert was actually a lush

1035
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,980
green forest, you come out, turn right.

1036
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,460
And it's all you can do.

1037
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,860
You can't go straight, because that's the ocean.

1038
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,780
Turn right, and you're in the Middle East.

1039
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,780
And that's why we find those to be some of the

1040
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,340
earliest settlements.

1041
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:50,300
So here's the excavation in Israel, finding these

1042
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,740
different aspects of it.

1043
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:59,180
There's also good evidence that erectus traveled across

1044
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:03,660
distances they could not see across in the ocean.

1045
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,300
And there are several interesting

1046
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,500
things to draw from this.

1047
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,860
First of all, most marine archaeologists argue that you

1048
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:13,940
can't have a viable human community without 20 to 40

1049
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:18,140
people arriving roughly at the same time in an area.

1050
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,900
So when we find evidence of viable human culture in

1051
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:26,740
places like Flores in Indonesia, so if you look at

1052
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:30,700
the island of Flores in Indonesia, the point where

1053
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:34,540
erectus would have had to cross is about 28 miles.

1054
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:38,100
So it's about the size of the English Channel.

1055
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,940
You could think, well, people swim the English Channel, and

1056
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,700
we know that other animals could swim across.

1057
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:49,340
But Flores is split off from the rest of what would have

1058
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:53,620
been at that time the mainland by the strongest ocean

1059
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,620
current in the world.

1060
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,300
It's called the Pacific Through Flow.

1061
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,900
And it was the same current back then, 750,000 years ago,

1062
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:02,620
as far as we can tell.

1063
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,500
So it was too difficult for a human to swim

1064
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,380
across that current.

1065
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,340
In fact, if you just put a raft in the water or just put a

1066
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:13,100
log in the water and start off, you're going to get

1067
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,420
washed out to sea.

1068
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,700
You're not going to make it to Flores.

1069
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,100
The current is too strong.

1070
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,700
So for humans who have gotten there, it's highly likely

1071
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,940
that they had boat-building capability.

1072
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,180
In fact, an archaeologist in Australia, Robert Bednarik,

1073
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:34,940
has built boats using erectus tools, etchulian tools, and

1074
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,700
level-wa tools, and shown that he can build boats that

1075
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,380
can get there in that period of time.

1076
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,700
The question is, could they have done that without language?

1077
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:49,940
And there's an article by a moxplunk evolutionary

1078
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:53,500
anthropologist, David Gill, called, how much grammar do

1079
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,300
you need to build a boat?

1080
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,300
And he argues that you actually don't need much grammar,

1081
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,780
but you do need language to be able to build a boat.

1082
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:04,340
And so the idea that they could sail, and this is a

1083
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:07,860
controversial idea, most things said about the past are

1084
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:11,980
controversial, because you can say they got there, and they

1085
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,220
had to get there in a certain number.

1086
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,460
But you can't show that they got several places.

1087
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:21,020
The ideal thing would be to show them in places where we

1088
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:21,500
know.

1089
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,780
So some people have argued they got

1090
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,700
across by tsunamis, right?

1091
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:30,220
But that sort of defies the physics of tsunamis, which tend

1092
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:32,100
to come towards the land.

1093
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,740
Now there are cases of people who've been found out to see

1094
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,660
there was a Japanese guy found floating on a roof, I think,

1095
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:41,140
after the tsunami that hit Japan a couple of years ago.

1096
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:43,900
So it does occasionally happen, but it doesn't seem to be a

1097
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:48,380
very productive way of travel, sort of fortuitous.

1098
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,180
And they did this a lot, even in places where we don't know

1099
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,780
of tsunamis having hit.

1100
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,260
So Kotra, the Russian archaeological team, found

1101
00:55:55,260 --> 00:56:01,580
evidence in Sokotra 1.4 million years ago, which is 150

1102
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:04,420
miles from the closest land.

1103
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:07,500
We start to see evidence of potential burial.

1104
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,220
This stone on the right is called Excalibur.

1105
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:14,700
It's a colored handaxe of the period, a Julian handaxe, and

1106
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,940
it was found in a grave.

1107
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,180
Does that mean it was buried on purpose with them?

1108
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,740
We start to see evidence of that.

1109
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:23,420
It's difficult to say convincingly that it was, but it

1110
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:27,100
is interesting that it was a colored handaxe found.

1111
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,620
Around the time that Neanderthal was starting to

1112
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:33,860
appear, the erectus Neanderthal transition period, we

1113
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:38,780
find wooden spears that were preserved for almost 400,000

1114
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:42,940
years, according to some dating, which would have put them

1115
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:46,020
back in the time of erectus.

1116
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:52,420
So erectus, about 1.5 million years ago, they start making

1117
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,700
extremely complicated tools.

1118
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,700
They start traveling around the world.

1119
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,900
They start an evolutionary process physical where they

1120
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,820
start to get more articulate speech, the capacity for

1121
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,300
more articulate speech.

1122
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,540
They seem to be mastering boat travel.

1123
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,820
The ocean was never a barrier to erectus.

1124
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,180
Anytime there's an ocean barrier, you can expect to

1125
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,540
find erectus on the other side.

1126
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:17,740
They had organized settlements.

1127
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:22,340
So all of these tasks imply the likelihood of language.

1128
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:26,140
If we look at other species and we see species that are far

1129
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,780
removed from humans that seem to approximate some sort of

1130
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:33,260
linguistic ability, it's hardly surprising that what we

1131
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,540
would see an even greater ability in these creatures

1132
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,980
that were so much like us and had almost

1133
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,580
modern-sized brains.

1134
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:44,820
So if it's correct, there is evidence for language.

1135
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:48,060
Nobody could say this case has been proven, but it is

1136
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:48,820
highly likely.

1137
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,700
Once we take off the burden of languages looking like

1138
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,660
modern languages and we realize that a language is the

1139
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,620
transfer of information by the discovery and use of

1140
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:01,020
symbols and elaboration of those symbols over time, then

1141
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,860
we see a gradual evolution of language and we see

1142
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,420
evidence of erectus and no reason to withhold the

1143
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,340
judgment that they had language to account for all the

1144
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:14,020
different things that they were able to accomplish in

1145
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:16,020
their long history.

1146
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,620
They were preceded by these guys.

1147
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:22,820
These are just the various species of Australopithecines.

1148
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:27,060
Nature experimented a lot before it got to us.

1149
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:30,860
That could mean that we're the best or it could mean that

1150
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:34,820
it doesn't necessarily mean that we're the best.

1151
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:40,500
And when we ask where erectus went, just look around.

1152
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,020
We are erectus.

1153
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:52,140
Erectus was the ancestor of Neanderthal, of sapiens, of

1154
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:55,980
every other human creature that has existed.

1155
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:58,900
They were the smartest creatures the world had ever seen.

1156
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,340
They were the most widely traveled.

1157
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,220
They sailed, they built fire, they had settlements.

1158
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:08,060
They had strong evidence for symbolism in their tools.

1159
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:11,820
It's very difficult to see why we would withhold the

1160
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:16,460
judgment that they likely had language.

1161
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:20,020
And what they had to have had was more than simply grunts

1162
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,500
and squeals.

1163
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,300
They had to have something that was able to communicate

1164
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:27,700
actual content about the world around them, the kind of

1165
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,820
thing that would have been essential and been

1166
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:30,740
discovered and symboled.

1167
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,700
So thank you very much.

1168
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,940
We have time for a few questions.

1169
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:57,180
If anyone wants to raise their hand, I can run this.

1170
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:02,700
Hello.

1171
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,180
Thank you for a nice talk.

1172
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:09,980
To my knowledge, what is peculiar to Homo sapiens is

1173
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:15,020
the use of actual, what we would today call, artwork,

1174
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:18,100
such as was seen, of course, in the stone caves in France

1175
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:21,220
and perhaps in Africa earlier.

1176
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,660
Your talk is the first I've heard where you can say that

1177
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:28,820
Homo erectus was actually doing, I don't know if you call it

1178
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:29,660
art or not.

1179
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,060
Of course, today we still don't know what is art and what

1180
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,660
is not, but that's another matter.

1181
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:38,020
But that is one thing that seems to have been peculiar.

1182
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:42,020
Even that occurred relatively late in the lifetime of

1183
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,260
Homo sapiens.

1184
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:46,300
Also, I'd be interested to know if you think Homo erectus,

1185
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:49,980
not only had learned how to use fire, but had actually

1186
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,180
learned how to make it.

1187
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,220
So thank you.

1188
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,780
Yeah.

1189
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,100
On fire, the archaeological evidence seems to be that,

1190
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:57,980
yes, they could make it.

1191
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:59,140
They had controlled use of fire.

1192
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,260
We find it regularly in their settlements.

1193
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:05,540
As far as artwork, this is a red herring that a lot of

1194
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:10,340
archaeologists have thought to be somewhat important,

1195
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,540
because we think of art as symbolic.

1196
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:15,180
Actually, some art is symbolic, but a lot of art,

1197
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,980
especially representational art, is simply iconic.

1198
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:20,140
It's a lower level of cognitive

1199
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:21,340
development than symbolism.

1200
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:27,260
So art is a wonderful accomplishment, but it's not

1201
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,180
crucial to the linguistic line.

1202
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,900
It's a sort of red herring to think that if we find

1203
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:35,300
painting, it's almost certain that if we find painting,

1204
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,300
they could talk.

1205
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,860
But there's no argument from that to that if we don't find

1206
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,660
painting, they couldn't talk.

1207
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,460
Painting is just a development.

1208
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:45,460
Cultures develop over time.

1209
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:48,180
And I know of many cultures that I've done research on in

1210
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:50,500
the Amazon that have no art, but they certainly can talk.

1211
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:59,860
They don't do anything that is more elaborate in some ways

1212
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,420
than Homo erectus did.

1213
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:04,300
Homo erectus was a hunter-gatherer ban.

1214
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:08,820
And so we find many cultures today that live fairly

1215
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,140
similarly.

1216
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,180
They're a lot smarter.

1217
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,100
They have bigger brains.

1218
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:15,500
They can think of other things.

1219
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,940
And if you take them out of the hunter-gatherer ban and raise

1220
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:21,100
them in a city, they'll be unrecognizable for anybody else

1221
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,540
who was raised in the city, which I doubt would be the case

1222
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:24,380
for Homo erectus.

1223
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:31,220
But at the same time, art doesn't.

1224
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:33,580
We want to say that art represents language because

1225
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,780
it's complicated cultural accomplishment.

1226
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:40,620
And it can be symbolic, but it's often simply iconic.

1227
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:43,540
So art seems to be a separate cultural development that is

1228
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,420
off the line of language evolution.

1229
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:49,780
And I don't find it convincing to say that art is either here

1230
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:52,580
nor there when it comes to language evolution.

1231
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:04,180
Tasty.

1232
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:07,940
How would you describe the limitations of their language?

1233
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:08,780
Of erectus?

1234
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:09,620
Yes.

1235
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:16,820
So I work with languages that have similar properties.

1236
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:19,540
I mean, so in other words, if you think about what the

1237
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:23,660
simplest grammar could be, just words in a linear order, I've

1238
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,860
worked with languages like that.

1239
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:28,780
And the fact is they can say anything we can say.

1240
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:32,380
The complicated grammars that we have have very useful

1241
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:35,980
communicative functions, but they are not necessary to

1242
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:39,300
express modern thought or complicated thought.

1243
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:43,700
So the fact that somebody, we can say they have a simple

1244
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,020
grammar doesn't mean they have simple thought.

1245
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:49,140
That's another thing that has happened in the history of

1246
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:52,740
anthropology and linguistics to somehow think that language

1247
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,260
is the mirror of thought.

1248
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:55,740
And it doesn't have to be.

1249
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,300
There are a lot of things.

1250
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,620
For example, I work with hunter-gatherer groups that

1251
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:03,460
have very few words for time.

1252
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,420
Does this mean they don't know there was yesterday?

1253
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,940
So the Piedohan, for example, have no word for yesterday and

1254
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,020
no word for tomorrow.

1255
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:11,580
And we often find that this or that culture doesn't have a

1256
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:15,260
word for X, and so we drive all kinds of conclusions from it.

1257
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:17,500
But I don't see any conclusions to draw from that.

1258
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,940
They can think about those things.

1259
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:21,220
Everybody knows they got up yesterday, and they're getting

1260
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,220
up today, and they'll probably get up tomorrow.

1261
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:25,500
But the fact that they choose not to talk about them is a

1262
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,940
separate kind of cultural value.

1263
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:33,460
So I don't find the simplicity of grammar connected very

1264
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:35,420
tightly to the complexity of thought.

1265
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:47,780
Yeah, if they had symbols, they probably didn't have many

1266
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:48,980
limitations.

1267
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:51,660
I mean, you could say maybe they had the intelligence of an

1268
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:55,060
eight-year-old or a 10-year-old sapient's child.

1269
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,460
No way to really know that, but let's say they did.

1270
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,180
Eight-year-olds can talk a lot.

1271
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:08,500
I'm curious if we know how easy or difficult it is to know

1272
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:14,380
whether a tool that they used was made by them and not

1273
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:15,660
created by nature.

1274
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:18,340
How can we discern?

1275
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,780
Well, it's always very hard when you're going back in time to

1276
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:24,660
have dating methods that can link them to a species.

1277
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:28,180
So if you find a tool that's 600,000 years old, they were

1278
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:30,580
the only ones around.

1279
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:33,860
Nobody else was around, so they made it.

1280
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:37,940
But if you find a tool that was 150,000 years old, well,

1281
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:40,580
there were a lot of species of humans around at that time.

1282
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:43,580
So narrowing it down to Homo erectus becomes more

1283
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:47,820
difficult, but you can guess based on the settlement

1284
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:48,260
patterns.

1285
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,500
But it's difficult to tell with precision once you start

1286
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,300
getting into the area where other Homo species were

1287
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,780
existing side by side.

1288
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,380
Oh, that it was made.

1289
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:06,060
Some of the older on tools could have just one rock fell on

1290
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,300
another, and suddenly you get this.

1291
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:10,340
But these Atulian tools, these more complex tools, there's

1292
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,300
no way they came about by accident.

1293
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:16,540
They had to have been designed, planned, and constructed

1294
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,420
with a great deal of craftsmanship.

1295
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:22,700
It takes hundreds of hours, at least 500 hours, from what I've

1296
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:25,860
heard, for graduate student in archaeology to be able to make

1297
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:30,820
an Atulian handaxe, not to make, that's how long it takes

1298
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,340
to learn it.

1299
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:32,980
They can make them faster after that.

1300
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:44,180
I'm curious to know what led to the, I guess, eventual demise

1301
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:48,580
of this species given your talk, how successful they have

1302
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:52,380
been at traveling and establishing communities

1303
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,380
all around the world.

1304
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:58,820
So I'm just curious, what led to a global end

1305
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:01,380
to such a successful run?

1306
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:05,020
Yeah, that's a very good question.

1307
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:07,060
We're the only ones left standing.

1308
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,980
So did they die out?

1309
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,260
Did they become us?

1310
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,380
One answer is they didn't die.

1311
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,580
We are them.

1312
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:19,740
The other answer is that Homo sapiens is, they're smarter,

1313
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:22,940
and one thing we've shown as a species throughout our history

1314
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:27,420
is the ability to slaughter other people that look like us.

1315
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:30,540
So the fact that the Homo sapiens might have killed them all

1316
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:33,700
doesn't seem to have, that doesn't seem to be totally

1317
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,620
outside the realm of possibility either.

1318
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:38,580
So I don't know why they disappeared.

1319
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:40,780
And I was asked a similar question

1320
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:42,180
when I was giving a talk in Hungary,

1321
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:44,140
and I probably should have been more careful.

1322
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:47,260
But I said, the Hungarian Jews didn't disappear

1323
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:50,780
because they didn't have language.

1324
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:54,060
So there are all kinds of reasons that people disappear.

1325
01:07:55,060 --> 01:08:06,060
Hi.

1326
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:07,700
You briefly said at the beginning

1327
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,020
that the Homo erectus, there was one

1328
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:12,060
that they found a hyoid bone in it,

1329
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:15,540
so that you're speculating that then they have vocal cords

1330
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:20,780
and they could then produce sounds.

1331
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:25,420
So are you thinking the later species all had the hyoid bones

1332
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,540
and could vocalize?

1333
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:29,580
We don't really know.

1334
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,540
Some people, to come to Fitch would believe

1335
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:36,460
that we almost certainly had, Homo erectus

1336
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,980
had this modern speech capability.

1337
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:42,860
My point is that it really doesn't matter.

1338
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:45,500
Evolving modern speech is a tremendous advantage,

1339
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,660
but it's not a necessary condition,

1340
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:50,180
nor is it a sufficient condition for having language.

1341
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:52,900
We can look at other species that seem to have.

1342
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:56,140
We listen to a parrot.

1343
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,380
They can produce human speech sounds fairly well.

1344
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,660
That's so it shows that it's not a sufficient condition

1345
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:04,100
for language, and the fact that erectus might not have had it

1346
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,980
would show that it's not a necessary condition

1347
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:08,980
for language, because we have deaf people today

1348
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:10,580
who talk with American sign language

1349
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,500
and say anything we can say.

1350
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,980
So language is looking for a physical medium

1351
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:20,100
to be transmitted, and that usually, and most efficiently,

1352
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,140
is human speech.

1353
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,300
And with quantal vowels and modern speech,

1354
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,500
we can communicate much more clearly,

1355
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,500
but it's neither necessary nor sufficient to have language.

1356
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,020
They could have produced sounds.

1357
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:36,380
They might not have been very clear,

1358
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,700
but the reason that chimpanzees don't talk

1359
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,020
is not because they can't produce sounds.

1360
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:42,180
They produce enough sounds.

1361
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:45,540
My point about computers is that any creature that

1362
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:49,820
can produce two sounds could talk in principle.

1363
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:55,100
My dog makes a lot of sounds, and I understand a lot of them.

1364
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,060
I'm trying to figure out if any of them are symbols,

1365
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:03,100
but they're certainly, she's very articulate in letting

1366
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:06,260
me know when it's time to do certain things.

1367
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:11,500
So I have mastered a repertoire of her sounds,

1368
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,500
and she uses them.

1369
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,340
But that doesn't mean that she, I

1370
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:17,820
don't expect her to give me advice about how

1371
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:22,260
to find my grandmother in Ancestry.com or something

1372
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:23,340
like that.

1373
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,780
These are cultural accomplishments

1374
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:30,060
that require a much greater set of symbols.

1375
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,620
I think that is about all we have time for.

1376
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:34,340
Give another hand to Daniel Everett.

1377
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,140
Thanks, everybody.

1378
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,140
Thank you.
