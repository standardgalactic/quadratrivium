0	7800	What I want to talk about today is what emergence is as a phenomenon, as a property that's actually
7800	12160	essential to understand the nature of the universe we live in, and that's actually essential
12160	17400	to understand what it means to be human, and that is essential for understanding the basis
17400	24200	for meaning, for ethics, for existentialism, and then also what that portends for the future
24200	29240	of civilization and addressing some of the things that are concerning and that are exciting.
29440	35600	Okay, so you can consider the next 20 minutes or however long this is as kind of an extemporaneous,
35600	42080	rambling ode to emergence itself, right, a kind of love talk about how cool it is that
42080	47040	universe actually has this property, and that we can understand and participate with it.
47040	52440	So let's start by defining what is emergence.
52440	56000	Emergence means something new arises that wasn't here before, right, we all kind of
56000	58000	have that sense intuitively.
58000	60640	But scientifically how the fuck does that happen?
60640	66200	How do you bring particles or planets or anything together, and all of a sudden the whole has
66200	70240	some properties that none of the parts had, like where do they come from?
70240	76240	Which is why in the fields of science that study emergence, which evolutionary theory
76240	80880	and biology and system science and complexity theory study it, it's considered the closest
80880	86320	thing to magic that's actually a scientifically kind of admissible term, but it's still sketchy,
86320	89840	right, in terms of really understanding how this thing works.
89840	96320	And because how do we get fundamentally new things out of relationships of things where
96320	99920	that didn't exist before, right, this is fascinating.
99920	108480	How do you have a cell that respirates, made up of molecules, none of whom respirate?
108480	113760	And so it's just really interesting when you actually think about this, right, we have
114320	118560	a paired term, does anyone know what the term is that is key in understanding synergy,
119920	121920	emergence is synergy.
121920	124720	Synergy and emergence are two sides of the same phenomena.
124720	129440	Synergy means a whole that's greater than the sum of its parts, emergence is what is that greater?
129440	133040	It is what is the new stuff that emerges out of bringing things together?
133040	139120	And so synergy is more formally defined as properties of whole systems that aren't found
139120	143200	in any of the parts taken separately, which also means that are fundamentally unpredicted
143200	148480	by the parts taken separately, which portends a future that is fundamentally ontologically
148480	153120	unpredictable from the current state of the future, which is very different than a mechanistic
153120	157840	clock unfolding Newtonian understanding of the future, and yet still actually makes sense in
157840	160000	terms of scientific law, super interesting, right?
160000	165920	So synergy is this property of relationship where the whole has new properties that the parts didn't have.
166160	173840	So emergence is a result of synergy, synergy is a result of relationship, does that make sense?
175680	178080	And relationship is a result of attractive forces.
179680	183040	There are some kinds of attractive forces, whether it's gravity bringing dust together
183040	187600	into planets or planets together into solar systems, whether it's electromagnetism bringing
187600	191920	subatomic particles together into atoms or the strong force bringing quarks together into
191920	197280	protons, each of those are emergent properties driven by synergy driven by relationship driven
197280	203200	by attraction, or whether it's bringing these people together via pheromones or love or intellectual
203200	206720	affinity or a topic that we're all interested in like creating a better world.
206720	213600	There's some attractive forces. And so Bucky Fuller called love metaphysical gravity in the
213600	218080	same way that gravity and physical forces act on physical bodies to attract them. We have
218080	222480	metaphysical forces that act on metaphysical bodies to drive attraction.
222480	228000	But think about, so imagine if you think about all of the attractive forces as expressions
228000	233280	of a fundamental principle of universe of allurement, that there is a principle by which
233280	238320	separate things have reason to come together that offers advantage that being separate doesn't have.
239600	242640	And you think about all of the forces as special case applications of that.
243360	248400	Imagine if that wasn't the case. Imagine if we had a universe where allurement wasn't a fundamental
248400	254480	principle of it. And the whole thing would have stopped at quantum foam, right? You have quantum
254480	258000	foam emerge. You don't even quite get to the point of subatomic particle and that's it because
258000	264480	nothing attracts to then have synergy and emergent properties. I have a friend and collaborator,
264480	269200	Mark Gaffney, who calls this universe a love story. Why at the heart of the evolutionary
269200	274000	story is this love story, which is that it's actually attraction driving the whole fucking
274000	279440	evolutionary story, right? Attraction driving relationship, driving synergy, driving new
279440	284240	emergent properties, driving net novelty and new creation and the arrow of evolution. So we can
284240	289440	actually understand the arrow of evolution itself in terms of this set of phenomenon together.
290000	297360	Does that make sense? So then evolution in complexity theory is defined most generally
297360	302960	in terms of more elegantly ordered complexity. That's actually the best definition we have
302960	307840	in terms of mathematical complexity theory coming out of Santa Fe Institute. The definition has the
307840	311440	word elegance built right in it because it's again one of these actually fairly mysterious
311440	316880	properties, but that's key to it, which is bringing things together doesn't give you emergent properties,
316880	323600	bringing them together in a particularly elegantly ordered way does. So think about all the parts
323680	331120	that make up a cell, right? You've got all these non-living parts, DNA and cell nucleus structures
331120	337280	and all the different organelles and cytoplasm and they're all not living and then the cell is
337280	341200	living, but if you brought all those parts together but you didn't arrange them as a cell,
341200	345360	it was just a bunch of molecules, it wouldn't be that interesting, right? Just being goo. If you
345360	349520	took the 50 trillion cells that made you and you didn't arrange them exactly this way and you just
349520	355120	had like 150 pounds worth of cells, it would be much less interesting. Even though there'd be just
355120	359520	as much complexity, you wouldn't have an order in the complexity where the emergent property comes.
359520	364400	That's actually the relationship. It's not just heaps coming together, it's not just complexity,
364400	369040	it's holes, and the difference between a hole and a heap is order and a specific set of patterns
369040	376240	of order. This means not every relationship is synergistic. Some relationships are entropic.
377200	381760	They actually create the opposite direction of new emergent properties. They destroy some
381760	387120	properties that were already there, right? Almost everyone has some examples.
390560	395360	But you can bring chemicals together that rather than self-organizing to create higher
396000	400080	ordered molecules with new thermodynamic properties, they have an exothermic entropic
400080	405520	reaction and they drop to lower levels of organization, right? This is true at all levels,
405520	410000	so it's not just relationship, it's specific kinds of relationship that maximize synergy.
410800	415680	This is a key thing to understand about the nature of universe. It's also the case that if you bring
415680	420240	the same thing together, a bunch of the same thing, you don't get very interesting synergies.
420240	423760	You get very interesting synergies when you bring different things with different properties together
423760	427680	in the right format where then you have the properties of each of those things and then
427680	431760	the properties of the relationship between those, which is the new stuff, and you get emergent. So
431760	435920	you've got hydrogen and you've got oxygen, which are different things and you bring them
435920	440160	together and you get water on the basis for life, but neither hydrogen nor oxygen at room
440160	447200	temperature or liquids, right? And so this is a fascinating thing. So we're actually very interested
447200	454080	in having deep synergistic relationships with differences that lead to fundamentally new
454080	460000	emerging properties. So it's not just net complexity, it's ordered complexity and it's
460000	464720	elegantly ordered complexity. And then when you get a new property, then universe selects for that,
464720	470000	right? That new property offers some evolutionary advantage to that system, that a system that
470000	474160	didn't have that wouldn't have. So things can come together all kinds of ways, but the ones that
474160	478640	come together most synergistically offer and confer the most advantage and universe selects for it.
478640	485200	So universe is actually selecting for more differences, right? So it's selecting for diversity
485200	491280	and then more synergistic combinations across those differences that, and it's both of those,
491280	497200	more diversity and more unification across the diversity, right? More agency and more symbiosis
497200	502800	at the same time is what defines the era of evolution. Does that make sense?
506320	513600	Things that are separate autonomous agents, right? So like a cell you can think of as having its own
513600	518720	agency, right? Its own ability to act and its own boundary and periphery. But you bring a bunch
518720	524560	of cells together and this collection of cells can reflect on consciousness and existentialism
524560	529520	and have a conversation like this, even though none of those cells on their own do that, right?
530560	534880	And it's different kinds of cells. You couldn't do that with just neurons. It takes neurons and
534880	540640	glial cells and immune cells and stem cells, et cetera, to all come together. So more agency,
540640	545680	more differentiation, more orderly relationship, more synergy, all of that comes together and
545680	551920	the net defining thing is emergence. How much fundamental new advantage arises and that's
551920	557600	what evolution selects for. And so if it wasn't for this whole combination of things together,
557600	567760	is this the message that says five minutes left? Fascinating. So I'll see if we can go
567760	571360	very quickly through. That was the first one percent of what I hoped to discuss.
573680	577040	So I'm going to just skim over the top of a bunch of topics and hopefully
577600	580880	paint a gestalt at least of an arc that's interesting.
583040	589760	So the evolutionary universe story, the kind of new best story of universe we have emerging from
589760	593680	the intersection of all the sciences is that we have an evolutionary universe that doesn't
593680	598960	require a creator agent, deistic or theistic God to create, but is also not just random,
599520	603760	highly improbable set of movements that get us here, but there is a set of properties
603760	609920	that give us a self organizing rather than creative agent, creative principle universe
609920	614640	that is moving towards more elegant ordered complexity. And with that story on the physical,
614640	620000	you also have the evolution of consciousness structures themselves, right? As you move from
620000	624560	a reptilian nervous system to the increased orderly complexity of a mammalian and then a neocortical
624560	629360	and then a prefrontal nervous system, you move from the kinds of sentience that map to that of
629360	634720	pain, pleasure at reptilian to emotional to cognition to abstraction. So we have a universe
634720	638960	that's moving in the direction of not only more elegance, but greater depths and breadth of
638960	646560	consciousness itself. Now this defines an era of evolution that reifies meaning in a very interesting
646560	651760	way. And one of the things that's so interesting is with our capacity for abstraction, we cannot
651760	655520	just think about our experiential self of the moment, but we can think about ourselves in
655520	661600	abstract terms. We can think about time abstractly, deep past and deep future, right? And that is what
661600	666240	allows us to actually understand evolution itself. It's an understanding of deep past and fossil
666240	672160	record and astrophysics that give us a sense of the ability to abstract laws of how that change
672160	677280	occurs over time that allows us a deeper insight as to how we got here and then also the ability
677280	681600	to vision a future fundamentally more beautiful and more interesting and then be part of that creative
681600	689120	process. So it's worthwhile just noting that our prefrontal cortex and our capacity for abstraction
689120	695040	is a pretty new phenomena evolutionarily, right? And it's also a very powerful set of capabilities
695040	698960	and when you have a new phenomena that's very powerful, you're not going to know how to use it
698960	702880	that well. Many of its applications will be destructive until you've figured out. So we can
702880	707200	think about the future as worry. We can think about the past as regret. We can think about
707200	714880	self abstractly in terms of negative self comparison. So then we have spiritual ideals emerge that
714880	720880	basically say this is all bad, right? Mind and the ability for abstraction like this is bad.
720880	724320	We should not think about the future at all or think about the past and just be in the moment
724320	729120	like the other animals and children are see how happy they are. But it's a it's a regressive
729120	734320	spirituality that is actually rejecting the fundamentally novel human capability that emerged
734320	738720	rather than say let's learn how to use it well for its evolutionary purposes in a fundamentally
738720	744960	evolving universe. So if we learn how to use it well, then we say how can we learn from the past
744960	751360	how universe works to be able to imagine a future in an omniconsiderate way that is
752320	756640	has fundamentally less suffering and higher quality of life across all meaningful quality
756640	760960	of life metrics for all life, right? There's omniconsiderately true, good and beautiful. And then
760960	766400	how can we apply all that learning now to actually help create that world? And in doing so we stop
766400	771040	just being a part of the whole. But in our ability to think about the whole and think about the
771040	776000	direction of the whole, we can actually become an agent for the whole. This is fucking huge, right?
776000	780480	The B is serving this huge role in evolution by pollinating the plants that make the atmosphere
780480	784080	that make us, but they don't know they're doing that and they can't consciously figure out how to
784080	789760	do it better. But we actually have the capability of looking at what the whole story is and identifying
789760	796160	as well the whole evolutionary impulse of universe brought me about and then woke up to itself in me.
797840	802880	And so in a meaningful way, I am actually the evolutionary impulse of universe awoke to itself
802880	807440	in a form that has adequate ordered complexity to contemplate that and then get to consciously
807440	817120	choose how to participate with it to be in a not just a board spaceship earth but crew, right?
817120	822160	To help steer the direction of evolution and cosmos. And so we move from evolution as a mostly
822160	829200	unconscious algorithmic process that selects for dominance now to a process that can be mediated
829200	834560	by conscious agents. They can actually forecast a more beautiful future and select to help create
834560	844080	that. Does that make sense? So when we don't identify as evolutionaries, then we can be actually kind
844080	850160	of we identify as nouns rather than verbs and we stay stuck where we're at and then we need pain
850160	855280	as an evolutionary driver and then emergence through emergency is how we grow. As soon as we
855280	861280	identify with the inexorability of evolution and ourselves as evolution incarnate, we stop needing
861280	866640	pain to push us because our whole fucking purpose for being, for becoming, being becoming are actually
866640	872400	matched. They're two sides of the same thing is the lure of the becoming is the bringing about more
872400	876800	of the timeless properties of the infinite in time, right? More of the infinite through the finite.
876800	881360	This actually becomes the basis of our existence and everybody knows that when you are in the
881360	886880	experience of creating beauty that didn't exist before in universe that adds to universe that's
886880	890800	uniquely yours to create, you feel a kind of aliveness that's not matched by anything else.
892240	899360	In lieu of not doing that, the emptiness causes all kinds of addiction, right? Because that's
899360	904960	fundamental to what we're actually here to do. Now when we all identify as evolutionaries, we
904960	912000	obsolete the need as pain for a driver. Does that make sense? Because we have a pole driver rather
912000	918160	than just needing the push driver. When we also identify as fundamentally interconnected parts
918960	923520	of a interconnected universe rather than separate things, we stop thinking that there is any
923520	928080	definition of success for self that isn't the definition of success for the whole. And we stop
928080	932640	thinking that the idea of advantaging ourselves at the expense of something else we're inexorably
932640	939520	interconnected to makes sense at all. So we are all agents for an interconnected whole where our
939520	944800	sense of self is, our self is actually an emergent property of the intersection of this system with
944800	950240	the rest of universe. It's actually key in terms of emergence, yourself is an emergent property
950240	955840	of the whole universe. Because even though you wouldn't exist in the same way without your brain
955840	960560	and your body, you also wouldn't exist without the atmosphere and the trees that make it and the
961360	966720	plants and bacteria that make it and the gravity and electromagnetism and foundational forces like
966720	973360	the concept of I separate from universe is a misnomer. Does that make sense? So the concept of
974080	977920	a life path for our self that isn't a life path for universe is a misnomer
979200	985600	or advantage for self. So then we get in the deepest sense when Einstein said the idea that
985600	992000	there are separate things is an optical delusion of consciousness. And in reality there is one
992640	997760	reality that we call universe of which we are all inextricably interconnected facets.
998480	1004160	And your experience of self is a facet of that. Now what's so fucking fascinating is that it is
1004160	1008160	interconnected with all of it. It's an expression of the foundation of all of it and it's also
1008160	1015200	completely unique in all of universe. It's a unique facet, non fungibly unique, right? What that means
1015200	1021600	is you have something to offer universe in your experience and your creativity that no one else
1022560	1028080	has to offer exactly that way which means if you don't offer it like if Salvador Dali hadn't done
1028080	1034720	Dali, Michelangelo didn't do Dali, Escher wouldn't have done Dali, Dali just wouldn't have happened.
1036240	1041840	And so universe would have been fundamentally less. So when you get that your own self-actualization
1041840	1047760	is compulsory, right? You have an obligation to it but then when you get that everyone else if
1047760	1052560	they don't self-actualize universe is less, your participation with helping everyone else self-actualize
1052560	1060560	is also compulsory. So competition is an obsolete concept. Symbiotic to remember universe moves
1060560	1065120	towards more differentiation, more novelty, and then more symbiosis across that novelty for more
1065120	1072320	emergence. And what we're moving towards is a civilization where everyone actually identifies
1072320	1078640	this way as an emergent property of the whole, as an interconnected part of universe with a unique
1078640	1083760	role to play, with unique synergies with all the other unique roles to play. And then with that
1083760	1089280	synergy, with that human participation, then humanity actually becomes a thing. It actually
1089280	1094000	becomes an emergent property. Right now it's an idea but we don't have humanity, we don't have
1094000	1101200	civilization, we have humans bumping, right? We have a bunch of organelles that haven't organized
1101200	1105440	as a cell that starts breathing, right? You don't have behavior of the whole that is
1106160	1112960	centrally and consciously self-organizing, but we can. And I would actually say, and this is what
1112960	1118480	I wanted to have more time to get into, but to just foreshadow quickly, if we cherry pick
1118480	1123120	from the huge data sets about where humanity is going right now, we can see that things are
1123120	1127280	exponentially changing, which means changing at more and more rapid and more and more significant
1127280	1131760	rates. And you can cherry pick metrics where things are getting exponentially better, and that's
1131760	1136400	true, and other things are getting exponentially worse, and that's also true, which means the
1136400	1141520	future that you predict if you just follow any of those curves is not happening. If things are
1141520	1145040	getting exponentially better and worse at the same time, does everybody kind of get that that's
1145040	1149680	happening on different metrics? Then that doesn't mean things are getting better or worse, it means
1149680	1160400	the current system is destabilizing, and that means self-terminating, and then we either have a
1160400	1166000	discrete phase shift to a lower order intropic system or the emergence of a higher order system
1166000	1172480	that is foundationally different than the current system we have in every way. So the things getting
1172480	1179200	better are the pieces that can be reorganized to create a new civilization with a foundationally
1179200	1184880	new structure, right? Biosphere metrics are getting exponentially worse from misapplication of
1184880	1189680	technology. Technology's right application are making things fundamentally better, but technology's
1189680	1195360	giving us the capacity to do things like have data analytic capabilities to inventory all the
1195360	1199840	world's resources, to then be able to allocate all the world's resources to meet all the world's needs
1199840	1203680	with optimum efficiency, we never had that ability before. Like the transportation and
1203680	1207760	communication technologies that can actually make us a global civilization, we never had that before,
1208400	1215200	right? And so the technological capacities that require us to step up otherwise we, you know,
1215200	1220400	self-extinction is a very real thing, also make possible a discrete phase shift in evolution
1220400	1225360	that's characterized by three major things, and this will be where I end. At the level of social
1225360	1232160	systems, primarily economics, the key shift we're going to move to is a moving from a differential
1232160	1239120	advantage economy, it's defined by private ownership, valuation based in scarcity and
1239120	1245120	differential advantage, to an economic system that is defined by making sure that the incentive of
1245120	1249440	every agent and the well-being of every other agent and the commons is perfectly aligned with no
1249440	1254240	externality, meaning we actually understand that it's an interconnected system, we identify all
1254240	1258880	the externalities and internalize them so the system's actually defined by systemic advantage
1258960	1263840	for the whole. This is not communism or socialism or capitalism, it's something that was not possible
1263840	1268080	before to even anticipate, but it is how your body works, where none of the cells are
1268080	1270960	advantaging themselves at the expense of the other, they're doing what's best for them,
1270960	1278000	what's best for the whole, symbiotically at the same time, right? And so that's the key net shift
1278000	1281840	at the level of macroeconomics and correspondingly governance in all of our social structures, at
1281840	1286640	the level of infrastructure in the built world, we're moving from a linear materials economy
1286640	1291360	where we extract from the earth at ever-growing rates unsustainably from finite resources and
1291360	1296320	then turn it into trash, to a closed-loop materials economy where the trash is the new
1296320	1300560	stuff, we stop extracting from the earth, stop producing waste, and we actually have a post-growth
1301120	1306240	negative entropy, closed-loop materials economy, where we can live on-goingly at progressively
1306240	1312080	higher and higher quality of life, sustainably with the biosphere. So that's the infrastructure shift,
1312080	1316640	that's the social structure shift, and the superstructure, the memetic shift, is this awareness
1316640	1324080	of all of us as facets of one integrated self-evolving reality, where the well-being of everyone,
1324080	1328640	the well-being of everyone else, the well-being of the commons, are not meaningfully calculable
1328640	1335600	separate from each other. Now what's so interesting is there used to be such a thing as local
1335600	1341760	problems. When Gandhi was working with Home Rule for India, it was largely thought of as an Indian
1341760	1348320	problem, and it didn't directly affect everybody, right? When people in the U.S. wanted to, or who
1348320	1353120	founded the U.S. wanted to leave British Empire, there was somewhere else to go, and it was a,
1353120	1357360	you know, a local problem. Right now when we deal with species extinction and ocean acidification
1357360	1361840	and peak nitrogen, peak phosphorus, they're all global issues, and you can't solve them
1361840	1366000	without China, and without India, and without the U.S., and without everyone participating,
1366000	1370960	so the idea that we have local issues is gone. Our level of global infrastructure and technology
1370960	1376160	is made to where we have all global issues, and they're actually existential. They are
1376160	1380400	threatening of the biosphere. No one has ever had issues in the history of humanity that threaten
1380400	1386560	the ability of the species to continue, nor did they have ones that they had to face eminently
1386560	1390480	in short term, nor did they have the capacity to actually face those kinds of things, the data
1390480	1394400	science, the technology that could build something fundamentally new. What that means is we have
1395840	1404080	the most significant work that humanity has ever had with the most significant capabilities,
1405360	1411200	which also means the most potential to impact the biggest picture that any humans have ever had.
1414160	1417360	And it's easy to think about that, and then get caught back into like,
1417440	1422160	shit you gotta do next as part of to win at the current system that is going extinct,
1422160	1426080	but winning at a system that is absolutely leading the capability of life on earth to
1426080	1430800	continue, winning at a dying system is not an interesting win. If you ever think about the
1430800	1435920	definition of heaven, where you're in heaven, and there are people in hell, and you're happy,
1436880	1443280	you have to be a psychopath. You have to be able to separate from the experience of other sentient
1443280	1449360	things enough that you can be totally stoked with that level of suffering. Well, the idea in this
1449360	1453200	world that the level of intensity of suffering that's happening can be happening, and you can
1453200	1457040	just be stoked because you're killing it in your life, you have to be mildly psychopathic.
1458640	1464160	If we want to not be psychopaths, then there is no definition for success for ourselves, it is not
1464160	1469840	definition of success for everything. And now when we start really taking that seriously, fucking
1469840	1475360	everything changes. And then you start saying, well, what can I actually do to make my life of
1475360	1482240	greatest use to all life? And then your answer to that question, if you take it seriously and really
1482240	1485760	study and really work on it, and don't just like, ask the question, get overwhelmed, give up, and go
1485760	1491440	back to current stuff, your, your progressively better answer to that question will lead to the
1491440	1497360	emergence of your life, meaning and Dharma and path, and correspondingly the emergence of civilization
1497360	1505920	making it. That's it.
