1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
What I want to talk about today is what emergence is as a phenomenon, as a property that's actually

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,160
essential to understand the nature of the universe we live in, and that's actually essential

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,400
to understand what it means to be human, and that is essential for understanding the basis

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,200
for meaning, for ethics, for existentialism, and then also what that portends for the future

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,240
of civilization and addressing some of the things that are concerning and that are exciting.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,600
Okay, so you can consider the next 20 minutes or however long this is as kind of an extemporaneous,

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,080
rambling ode to emergence itself, right, a kind of love talk about how cool it is that

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,040
universe actually has this property, and that we can understand and participate with it.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,440
So let's start by defining what is emergence.

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,000
Emergence means something new arises that wasn't here before, right, we all kind of

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
have that sense intuitively.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,640
But scientifically how the fuck does that happen?

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,200
How do you bring particles or planets or anything together, and all of a sudden the whole has

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,240
some properties that none of the parts had, like where do they come from?

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,240
Which is why in the fields of science that study emergence, which evolutionary theory

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,880
and biology and system science and complexity theory study it, it's considered the closest

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,320
thing to magic that's actually a scientifically kind of admissible term, but it's still sketchy,

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,840
right, in terms of really understanding how this thing works.

19
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,320
And because how do we get fundamentally new things out of relationships of things where

20
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,920
that didn't exist before, right, this is fascinating.

21
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:48,480
How do you have a cell that respirates, made up of molecules, none of whom respirate?

22
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,760
And so it's just really interesting when you actually think about this, right, we have

23
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,560
a paired term, does anyone know what the term is that is key in understanding synergy,

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
emergence is synergy.

25
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,720
Synergy and emergence are two sides of the same phenomena.

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,440
Synergy means a whole that's greater than the sum of its parts, emergence is what is that greater?

27
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,040
It is what is the new stuff that emerges out of bringing things together?

28
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,120
And so synergy is more formally defined as properties of whole systems that aren't found

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,200
in any of the parts taken separately, which also means that are fundamentally unpredicted

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,480
by the parts taken separately, which portends a future that is fundamentally ontologically

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,120
unpredictable from the current state of the future, which is very different than a mechanistic

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,840
clock unfolding Newtonian understanding of the future, and yet still actually makes sense in

33
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,000
terms of scientific law, super interesting, right?

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,920
So synergy is this property of relationship where the whole has new properties that the parts didn't have.

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,840
So emergence is a result of synergy, synergy is a result of relationship, does that make sense?

36
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,080
And relationship is a result of attractive forces.

37
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,040
There are some kinds of attractive forces, whether it's gravity bringing dust together

38
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,600
into planets or planets together into solar systems, whether it's electromagnetism bringing

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,920
subatomic particles together into atoms or the strong force bringing quarks together into

40
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,280
protons, each of those are emergent properties driven by synergy driven by relationship driven

41
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,200
by attraction, or whether it's bringing these people together via pheromones or love or intellectual

42
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,720
affinity or a topic that we're all interested in like creating a better world.

43
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,600
There's some attractive forces. And so Bucky Fuller called love metaphysical gravity in the

44
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,080
same way that gravity and physical forces act on physical bodies to attract them. We have

45
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,480
metaphysical forces that act on metaphysical bodies to drive attraction.

46
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,000
But think about, so imagine if you think about all of the attractive forces as expressions

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,280
of a fundamental principle of universe of allurement, that there is a principle by which

48
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,320
separate things have reason to come together that offers advantage that being separate doesn't have.

49
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,640
And you think about all of the forces as special case applications of that.

50
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,400
Imagine if that wasn't the case. Imagine if we had a universe where allurement wasn't a fundamental

51
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,480
principle of it. And the whole thing would have stopped at quantum foam, right? You have quantum

52
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,000
foam emerge. You don't even quite get to the point of subatomic particle and that's it because

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,480
nothing attracts to then have synergy and emergent properties. I have a friend and collaborator,

54
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,200
Mark Gaffney, who calls this universe a love story. Why at the heart of the evolutionary

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,000
story is this love story, which is that it's actually attraction driving the whole fucking

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,440
evolutionary story, right? Attraction driving relationship, driving synergy, driving new

57
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,240
emergent properties, driving net novelty and new creation and the arrow of evolution. So we can

58
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,440
actually understand the arrow of evolution itself in terms of this set of phenomenon together.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,360
Does that make sense? So then evolution in complexity theory is defined most generally

60
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,960
in terms of more elegantly ordered complexity. That's actually the best definition we have

61
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,840
in terms of mathematical complexity theory coming out of Santa Fe Institute. The definition has the

62
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,440
word elegance built right in it because it's again one of these actually fairly mysterious

63
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,880
properties, but that's key to it, which is bringing things together doesn't give you emergent properties,

64
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,600
bringing them together in a particularly elegantly ordered way does. So think about all the parts

65
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:31,120
that make up a cell, right? You've got all these non-living parts, DNA and cell nucleus structures

66
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,280
and all the different organelles and cytoplasm and they're all not living and then the cell is

67
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,200
living, but if you brought all those parts together but you didn't arrange them as a cell,

68
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,360
it was just a bunch of molecules, it wouldn't be that interesting, right? Just being goo. If you

69
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,520
took the 50 trillion cells that made you and you didn't arrange them exactly this way and you just

70
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,120
had like 150 pounds worth of cells, it would be much less interesting. Even though there'd be just

71
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,520
as much complexity, you wouldn't have an order in the complexity where the emergent property comes.

72
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,400
That's actually the relationship. It's not just heaps coming together, it's not just complexity,

73
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,040
it's holes, and the difference between a hole and a heap is order and a specific set of patterns

74
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:16,240
of order. This means not every relationship is synergistic. Some relationships are entropic.

75
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,760
They actually create the opposite direction of new emergent properties. They destroy some

76
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,120
properties that were already there, right? Almost everyone has some examples.

77
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,360
But you can bring chemicals together that rather than self-organizing to create higher

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,080
ordered molecules with new thermodynamic properties, they have an exothermic entropic

79
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,520
reaction and they drop to lower levels of organization, right? This is true at all levels,

80
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,000
so it's not just relationship, it's specific kinds of relationship that maximize synergy.

81
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,680
This is a key thing to understand about the nature of universe. It's also the case that if you bring

82
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,240
the same thing together, a bunch of the same thing, you don't get very interesting synergies.

83
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,760
You get very interesting synergies when you bring different things with different properties together

84
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,680
in the right format where then you have the properties of each of those things and then

85
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,760
the properties of the relationship between those, which is the new stuff, and you get emergent. So

86
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,920
you've got hydrogen and you've got oxygen, which are different things and you bring them

87
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,160
together and you get water on the basis for life, but neither hydrogen nor oxygen at room

88
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,200
temperature or liquids, right? And so this is a fascinating thing. So we're actually very interested

89
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,080
in having deep synergistic relationships with differences that lead to fundamentally new

90
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,000
emerging properties. So it's not just net complexity, it's ordered complexity and it's

91
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,720
elegantly ordered complexity. And then when you get a new property, then universe selects for that,

92
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,000
right? That new property offers some evolutionary advantage to that system, that a system that

93
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,160
didn't have that wouldn't have. So things can come together all kinds of ways, but the ones that

94
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,640
come together most synergistically offer and confer the most advantage and universe selects for it.

95
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,200
So universe is actually selecting for more differences, right? So it's selecting for diversity

96
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,280
and then more synergistic combinations across those differences that, and it's both of those,

97
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,200
more diversity and more unification across the diversity, right? More agency and more symbiosis

98
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,800
at the same time is what defines the era of evolution. Does that make sense?

99
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:33,600
Things that are separate autonomous agents, right? So like a cell you can think of as having its own

100
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,720
agency, right? Its own ability to act and its own boundary and periphery. But you bring a bunch

101
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,560
of cells together and this collection of cells can reflect on consciousness and existentialism

102
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,520
and have a conversation like this, even though none of those cells on their own do that, right?

103
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,880
And it's different kinds of cells. You couldn't do that with just neurons. It takes neurons and

104
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,640
glial cells and immune cells and stem cells, et cetera, to all come together. So more agency,

105
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,680
more differentiation, more orderly relationship, more synergy, all of that comes together and

106
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,920
the net defining thing is emergence. How much fundamental new advantage arises and that's

107
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,600
what evolution selects for. And so if it wasn't for this whole combination of things together,

108
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:27,760
is this the message that says five minutes left? Fascinating. So I'll see if we can go

109
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,360
very quickly through. That was the first one percent of what I hoped to discuss.

110
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,040
So I'm going to just skim over the top of a bunch of topics and hopefully

111
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,880
paint a gestalt at least of an arc that's interesting.

112
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,760
So the evolutionary universe story, the kind of new best story of universe we have emerging from

113
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,680
the intersection of all the sciences is that we have an evolutionary universe that doesn't

114
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,960
require a creator agent, deistic or theistic God to create, but is also not just random,

115
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,760
highly improbable set of movements that get us here, but there is a set of properties

116
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,920
that give us a self organizing rather than creative agent, creative principle universe

117
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,640
that is moving towards more elegant ordered complexity. And with that story on the physical,

118
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,000
you also have the evolution of consciousness structures themselves, right? As you move from

119
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,560
a reptilian nervous system to the increased orderly complexity of a mammalian and then a neocortical

120
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,360
and then a prefrontal nervous system, you move from the kinds of sentience that map to that of

121
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,720
pain, pleasure at reptilian to emotional to cognition to abstraction. So we have a universe

122
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,960
that's moving in the direction of not only more elegance, but greater depths and breadth of

123
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:46,560
consciousness itself. Now this defines an era of evolution that reifies meaning in a very interesting

124
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,760
way. And one of the things that's so interesting is with our capacity for abstraction, we cannot

125
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,520
just think about our experiential self of the moment, but we can think about ourselves in

126
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,600
abstract terms. We can think about time abstractly, deep past and deep future, right? And that is what

127
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,240
allows us to actually understand evolution itself. It's an understanding of deep past and fossil

128
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,160
record and astrophysics that give us a sense of the ability to abstract laws of how that change

129
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,280
occurs over time that allows us a deeper insight as to how we got here and then also the ability

130
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,600
to vision a future fundamentally more beautiful and more interesting and then be part of that creative

131
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:29,120
process. So it's worthwhile just noting that our prefrontal cortex and our capacity for abstraction

132
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,040
is a pretty new phenomena evolutionarily, right? And it's also a very powerful set of capabilities

133
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,960
and when you have a new phenomena that's very powerful, you're not going to know how to use it

134
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,880
that well. Many of its applications will be destructive until you've figured out. So we can

135
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,200
think about the future as worry. We can think about the past as regret. We can think about

136
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,880
self abstractly in terms of negative self comparison. So then we have spiritual ideals emerge that

137
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,880
basically say this is all bad, right? Mind and the ability for abstraction like this is bad.

138
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,320
We should not think about the future at all or think about the past and just be in the moment

139
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,120
like the other animals and children are see how happy they are. But it's a it's a regressive

140
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,320
spirituality that is actually rejecting the fundamentally novel human capability that emerged

141
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,720
rather than say let's learn how to use it well for its evolutionary purposes in a fundamentally

142
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,960
evolving universe. So if we learn how to use it well, then we say how can we learn from the past

143
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:31,360
how universe works to be able to imagine a future in an omniconsiderate way that is

144
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,640
has fundamentally less suffering and higher quality of life across all meaningful quality

145
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,960
of life metrics for all life, right? There's omniconsiderately true, good and beautiful. And then

146
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,400
how can we apply all that learning now to actually help create that world? And in doing so we stop

147
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,040
just being a part of the whole. But in our ability to think about the whole and think about the

148
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,000
direction of the whole, we can actually become an agent for the whole. This is fucking huge, right?

149
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,480
The B is serving this huge role in evolution by pollinating the plants that make the atmosphere

150
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,080
that make us, but they don't know they're doing that and they can't consciously figure out how to

151
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,760
do it better. But we actually have the capability of looking at what the whole story is and identifying

152
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,160
as well the whole evolutionary impulse of universe brought me about and then woke up to itself in me.

153
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,880
And so in a meaningful way, I am actually the evolutionary impulse of universe awoke to itself

154
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,440
in a form that has adequate ordered complexity to contemplate that and then get to consciously

155
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:37,120
choose how to participate with it to be in a not just a board spaceship earth but crew, right?

156
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,160
To help steer the direction of evolution and cosmos. And so we move from evolution as a mostly

157
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,200
unconscious algorithmic process that selects for dominance now to a process that can be mediated

158
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,560
by conscious agents. They can actually forecast a more beautiful future and select to help create

159
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:04,080
that. Does that make sense? So when we don't identify as evolutionaries, then we can be actually kind

160
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,160
of we identify as nouns rather than verbs and we stay stuck where we're at and then we need pain

161
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,280
as an evolutionary driver and then emergence through emergency is how we grow. As soon as we

162
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:21,280
identify with the inexorability of evolution and ourselves as evolution incarnate, we stop needing

163
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,640
pain to push us because our whole fucking purpose for being, for becoming, being becoming are actually

164
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,400
matched. They're two sides of the same thing is the lure of the becoming is the bringing about more

165
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,800
of the timeless properties of the infinite in time, right? More of the infinite through the finite.

166
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,360
This actually becomes the basis of our existence and everybody knows that when you are in the

167
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,880
experience of creating beauty that didn't exist before in universe that adds to universe that's

168
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,800
uniquely yours to create, you feel a kind of aliveness that's not matched by anything else.

169
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:59,360
In lieu of not doing that, the emptiness causes all kinds of addiction, right? Because that's

170
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,960
fundamental to what we're actually here to do. Now when we all identify as evolutionaries, we

171
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:12,000
obsolete the need as pain for a driver. Does that make sense? Because we have a pole driver rather

172
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,160
than just needing the push driver. When we also identify as fundamentally interconnected parts

173
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,520
of a interconnected universe rather than separate things, we stop thinking that there is any

174
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,080
definition of success for self that isn't the definition of success for the whole. And we stop

175
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,640
thinking that the idea of advantaging ourselves at the expense of something else we're inexorably

176
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,520
interconnected to makes sense at all. So we are all agents for an interconnected whole where our

177
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,800
sense of self is, our self is actually an emergent property of the intersection of this system with

178
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,240
the rest of universe. It's actually key in terms of emergence, yourself is an emergent property

179
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,840
of the whole universe. Because even though you wouldn't exist in the same way without your brain

180
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,560
and your body, you also wouldn't exist without the atmosphere and the trees that make it and the

181
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,720
plants and bacteria that make it and the gravity and electromagnetism and foundational forces like

182
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,360
the concept of I separate from universe is a misnomer. Does that make sense? So the concept of

183
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,920
a life path for our self that isn't a life path for universe is a misnomer

184
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,600
or advantage for self. So then we get in the deepest sense when Einstein said the idea that

185
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,000
there are separate things is an optical delusion of consciousness. And in reality there is one

186
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,760
reality that we call universe of which we are all inextricably interconnected facets.

187
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,160
And your experience of self is a facet of that. Now what's so fucking fascinating is that it is

188
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,160
interconnected with all of it. It's an expression of the foundation of all of it and it's also

189
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:55,200
completely unique in all of universe. It's a unique facet, non fungibly unique, right? What that means

190
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,600
is you have something to offer universe in your experience and your creativity that no one else

191
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,080
has to offer exactly that way which means if you don't offer it like if Salvador Dali hadn't done

192
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:14,720
Dali, Michelangelo didn't do Dali, Escher wouldn't have done Dali, Dali just wouldn't have happened.

193
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,840
And so universe would have been fundamentally less. So when you get that your own self-actualization

194
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:27,760
is compulsory, right? You have an obligation to it but then when you get that everyone else if

195
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,560
they don't self-actualize universe is less, your participation with helping everyone else self-actualize

196
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:40,560
is also compulsory. So competition is an obsolete concept. Symbiotic to remember universe moves

197
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,120
towards more differentiation, more novelty, and then more symbiosis across that novelty for more

198
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:52,320
emergence. And what we're moving towards is a civilization where everyone actually identifies

199
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,640
this way as an emergent property of the whole, as an interconnected part of universe with a unique

200
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,760
role to play, with unique synergies with all the other unique roles to play. And then with that

201
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,280
synergy, with that human participation, then humanity actually becomes a thing. It actually

202
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,000
becomes an emergent property. Right now it's an idea but we don't have humanity, we don't have

203
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,200
civilization, we have humans bumping, right? We have a bunch of organelles that haven't organized

204
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,440
as a cell that starts breathing, right? You don't have behavior of the whole that is

205
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,960
centrally and consciously self-organizing, but we can. And I would actually say, and this is what

206
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,480
I wanted to have more time to get into, but to just foreshadow quickly, if we cherry pick

207
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,120
from the huge data sets about where humanity is going right now, we can see that things are

208
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,280
exponentially changing, which means changing at more and more rapid and more and more significant

209
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,760
rates. And you can cherry pick metrics where things are getting exponentially better, and that's

210
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,400
true, and other things are getting exponentially worse, and that's also true, which means the

211
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,520
future that you predict if you just follow any of those curves is not happening. If things are

212
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,040
getting exponentially better and worse at the same time, does everybody kind of get that that's

213
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,680
happening on different metrics? Then that doesn't mean things are getting better or worse, it means

214
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:20,400
the current system is destabilizing, and that means self-terminating, and then we either have a

215
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,000
discrete phase shift to a lower order intropic system or the emergence of a higher order system

216
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,480
that is foundationally different than the current system we have in every way. So the things getting

217
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,200
better are the pieces that can be reorganized to create a new civilization with a foundationally

218
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,880
new structure, right? Biosphere metrics are getting exponentially worse from misapplication of

219
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,680
technology. Technology's right application are making things fundamentally better, but technology's

220
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,360
giving us the capacity to do things like have data analytic capabilities to inventory all the

221
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,840
world's resources, to then be able to allocate all the world's resources to meet all the world's needs

222
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,680
with optimum efficiency, we never had that ability before. Like the transportation and

223
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,760
communication technologies that can actually make us a global civilization, we never had that before,

224
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,200
right? And so the technological capacities that require us to step up otherwise we, you know,

225
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,400
self-extinction is a very real thing, also make possible a discrete phase shift in evolution

226
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,360
that's characterized by three major things, and this will be where I end. At the level of social

227
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:32,160
systems, primarily economics, the key shift we're going to move to is a moving from a differential

228
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:39,120
advantage economy, it's defined by private ownership, valuation based in scarcity and

229
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,120
differential advantage, to an economic system that is defined by making sure that the incentive of

230
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,440
every agent and the well-being of every other agent and the commons is perfectly aligned with no

231
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,240
externality, meaning we actually understand that it's an interconnected system, we identify all

232
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,880
the externalities and internalize them so the system's actually defined by systemic advantage

233
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,840
for the whole. This is not communism or socialism or capitalism, it's something that was not possible

234
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,080
before to even anticipate, but it is how your body works, where none of the cells are

235
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,960
advantaging themselves at the expense of the other, they're doing what's best for them,

236
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:18,000
what's best for the whole, symbiotically at the same time, right? And so that's the key net shift

237
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,840
at the level of macroeconomics and correspondingly governance in all of our social structures, at

238
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,640
the level of infrastructure in the built world, we're moving from a linear materials economy

239
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,360
where we extract from the earth at ever-growing rates unsustainably from finite resources and

240
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,320
then turn it into trash, to a closed-loop materials economy where the trash is the new

241
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,560
stuff, we stop extracting from the earth, stop producing waste, and we actually have a post-growth

242
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,240
negative entropy, closed-loop materials economy, where we can live on-goingly at progressively

243
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,080
higher and higher quality of life, sustainably with the biosphere. So that's the infrastructure shift,

244
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,640
that's the social structure shift, and the superstructure, the memetic shift, is this awareness

245
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:04,080
of all of us as facets of one integrated self-evolving reality, where the well-being of everyone,

246
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,640
the well-being of everyone else, the well-being of the commons, are not meaningfully calculable

247
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:15,600
separate from each other. Now what's so interesting is there used to be such a thing as local

248
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,760
problems. When Gandhi was working with Home Rule for India, it was largely thought of as an Indian

249
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,320
problem, and it didn't directly affect everybody, right? When people in the U.S. wanted to, or who

250
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,120
founded the U.S. wanted to leave British Empire, there was somewhere else to go, and it was a,

251
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,360
you know, a local problem. Right now when we deal with species extinction and ocean acidification

252
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,840
and peak nitrogen, peak phosphorus, they're all global issues, and you can't solve them

253
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,000
without China, and without India, and without the U.S., and without everyone participating,

254
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,960
so the idea that we have local issues is gone. Our level of global infrastructure and technology

255
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,160
is made to where we have all global issues, and they're actually existential. They are

256
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,400
threatening of the biosphere. No one has ever had issues in the history of humanity that threaten

257
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,560
the ability of the species to continue, nor did they have ones that they had to face eminently

258
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,480
in short term, nor did they have the capacity to actually face those kinds of things, the data

259
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,400
science, the technology that could build something fundamentally new. What that means is we have

260
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:24,080
the most significant work that humanity has ever had with the most significant capabilities,

261
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,200
which also means the most potential to impact the biggest picture that any humans have ever had.

262
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,360
And it's easy to think about that, and then get caught back into like,

263
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,160
shit you gotta do next as part of to win at the current system that is going extinct,

264
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,080
but winning at a system that is absolutely leading the capability of life on earth to

265
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,800
continue, winning at a dying system is not an interesting win. If you ever think about the

266
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,920
definition of heaven, where you're in heaven, and there are people in hell, and you're happy,

267
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,280
you have to be a psychopath. You have to be able to separate from the experience of other sentient

268
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:09,360
things enough that you can be totally stoked with that level of suffering. Well, the idea in this

269
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,200
world that the level of intensity of suffering that's happening can be happening, and you can

270
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,040
just be stoked because you're killing it in your life, you have to be mildly psychopathic.

271
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,160
If we want to not be psychopaths, then there is no definition for success for ourselves, it is not

272
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:29,840
definition of success for everything. And now when we start really taking that seriously, fucking

273
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,360
everything changes. And then you start saying, well, what can I actually do to make my life of

274
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:42,240
greatest use to all life? And then your answer to that question, if you take it seriously and really

275
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,760
study and really work on it, and don't just like, ask the question, get overwhelmed, give up, and go

276
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,440
back to current stuff, your, your progressively better answer to that question will lead to the

277
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,360
emergence of your life, meaning and Dharma and path, and correspondingly the emergence of civilization

278
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:05,920
making it. That's it.
