00:00.000 --> 00:07.800
What I want to talk about today is what emergence is as a phenomenon, as a property that's actually

00:07.800 --> 00:12.160
essential to understand the nature of the universe we live in, and that's actually essential

00:12.160 --> 00:17.400
to understand what it means to be human, and that is essential for understanding the basis

00:17.400 --> 00:24.200
for meaning, for ethics, for existentialism, and then also what that portends for the future

00:24.200 --> 00:29.240
of civilization and addressing some of the things that are concerning and that are exciting.

00:29.440 --> 00:35.600
Okay, so you can consider the next 20 minutes or however long this is as kind of an extemporaneous,

00:35.600 --> 00:42.080
rambling ode to emergence itself, right, a kind of love talk about how cool it is that

00:42.080 --> 00:47.040
universe actually has this property, and that we can understand and participate with it.

00:47.040 --> 00:52.440
So let's start by defining what is emergence.

00:52.440 --> 00:56.000
Emergence means something new arises that wasn't here before, right, we all kind of

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
have that sense intuitively.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.640
But scientifically how the fuck does that happen?

01:00.640 --> 01:06.200
How do you bring particles or planets or anything together, and all of a sudden the whole has

01:06.200 --> 01:10.240
some properties that none of the parts had, like where do they come from?

01:10.240 --> 01:16.240
Which is why in the fields of science that study emergence, which evolutionary theory

01:16.240 --> 01:20.880
and biology and system science and complexity theory study it, it's considered the closest

01:20.880 --> 01:26.320
thing to magic that's actually a scientifically kind of admissible term, but it's still sketchy,

01:26.320 --> 01:29.840
right, in terms of really understanding how this thing works.

01:29.840 --> 01:36.320
And because how do we get fundamentally new things out of relationships of things where

01:36.320 --> 01:39.920
that didn't exist before, right, this is fascinating.

01:39.920 --> 01:48.480
How do you have a cell that respirates, made up of molecules, none of whom respirate?

01:48.480 --> 01:53.760
And so it's just really interesting when you actually think about this, right, we have

01:54.320 --> 01:58.560
a paired term, does anyone know what the term is that is key in understanding synergy,

01:59.920 --> 02:01.920
emergence is synergy.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.720
Synergy and emergence are two sides of the same phenomena.

02:04.720 --> 02:09.440
Synergy means a whole that's greater than the sum of its parts, emergence is what is that greater?

02:09.440 --> 02:13.040
It is what is the new stuff that emerges out of bringing things together?

02:13.040 --> 02:19.120
And so synergy is more formally defined as properties of whole systems that aren't found

02:19.120 --> 02:23.200
in any of the parts taken separately, which also means that are fundamentally unpredicted

02:23.200 --> 02:28.480
by the parts taken separately, which portends a future that is fundamentally ontologically

02:28.480 --> 02:33.120
unpredictable from the current state of the future, which is very different than a mechanistic

02:33.120 --> 02:37.840
clock unfolding Newtonian understanding of the future, and yet still actually makes sense in

02:37.840 --> 02:40.000
terms of scientific law, super interesting, right?

02:40.000 --> 02:45.920
So synergy is this property of relationship where the whole has new properties that the parts didn't have.

02:46.160 --> 02:53.840
So emergence is a result of synergy, synergy is a result of relationship, does that make sense?

02:55.680 --> 02:58.080
And relationship is a result of attractive forces.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.040
There are some kinds of attractive forces, whether it's gravity bringing dust together

03:03.040 --> 03:07.600
into planets or planets together into solar systems, whether it's electromagnetism bringing

03:07.600 --> 03:11.920
subatomic particles together into atoms or the strong force bringing quarks together into

03:11.920 --> 03:17.280
protons, each of those are emergent properties driven by synergy driven by relationship driven

03:17.280 --> 03:23.200
by attraction, or whether it's bringing these people together via pheromones or love or intellectual

03:23.200 --> 03:26.720
affinity or a topic that we're all interested in like creating a better world.

03:26.720 --> 03:33.600
There's some attractive forces. And so Bucky Fuller called love metaphysical gravity in the

03:33.600 --> 03:38.080
same way that gravity and physical forces act on physical bodies to attract them. We have

03:38.080 --> 03:42.480
metaphysical forces that act on metaphysical bodies to drive attraction.

03:42.480 --> 03:48.000
But think about, so imagine if you think about all of the attractive forces as expressions

03:48.000 --> 03:53.280
of a fundamental principle of universe of allurement, that there is a principle by which

03:53.280 --> 03:58.320
separate things have reason to come together that offers advantage that being separate doesn't have.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.640
And you think about all of the forces as special case applications of that.

04:03.360 --> 04:08.400
Imagine if that wasn't the case. Imagine if we had a universe where allurement wasn't a fundamental

04:08.400 --> 04:14.480
principle of it. And the whole thing would have stopped at quantum foam, right? You have quantum

04:14.480 --> 04:18.000
foam emerge. You don't even quite get to the point of subatomic particle and that's it because

04:18.000 --> 04:24.480
nothing attracts to then have synergy and emergent properties. I have a friend and collaborator,

04:24.480 --> 04:29.200
Mark Gaffney, who calls this universe a love story. Why at the heart of the evolutionary

04:29.200 --> 04:34.000
story is this love story, which is that it's actually attraction driving the whole fucking

04:34.000 --> 04:39.440
evolutionary story, right? Attraction driving relationship, driving synergy, driving new

04:39.440 --> 04:44.240
emergent properties, driving net novelty and new creation and the arrow of evolution. So we can

04:44.240 --> 04:49.440
actually understand the arrow of evolution itself in terms of this set of phenomenon together.

04:50.000 --> 04:57.360
Does that make sense? So then evolution in complexity theory is defined most generally

04:57.360 --> 05:02.960
in terms of more elegantly ordered complexity. That's actually the best definition we have

05:02.960 --> 05:07.840
in terms of mathematical complexity theory coming out of Santa Fe Institute. The definition has the

05:07.840 --> 05:11.440
word elegance built right in it because it's again one of these actually fairly mysterious

05:11.440 --> 05:16.880
properties, but that's key to it, which is bringing things together doesn't give you emergent properties,

05:16.880 --> 05:23.600
bringing them together in a particularly elegantly ordered way does. So think about all the parts

05:23.680 --> 05:31.120
that make up a cell, right? You've got all these non-living parts, DNA and cell nucleus structures

05:31.120 --> 05:37.280
and all the different organelles and cytoplasm and they're all not living and then the cell is

05:37.280 --> 05:41.200
living, but if you brought all those parts together but you didn't arrange them as a cell,

05:41.200 --> 05:45.360
it was just a bunch of molecules, it wouldn't be that interesting, right? Just being goo. If you

05:45.360 --> 05:49.520
took the 50 trillion cells that made you and you didn't arrange them exactly this way and you just

05:49.520 --> 05:55.120
had like 150 pounds worth of cells, it would be much less interesting. Even though there'd be just

05:55.120 --> 05:59.520
as much complexity, you wouldn't have an order in the complexity where the emergent property comes.

05:59.520 --> 06:04.400
That's actually the relationship. It's not just heaps coming together, it's not just complexity,

06:04.400 --> 06:09.040
it's holes, and the difference between a hole and a heap is order and a specific set of patterns

06:09.040 --> 06:16.240
of order. This means not every relationship is synergistic. Some relationships are entropic.

06:17.200 --> 06:21.760
They actually create the opposite direction of new emergent properties. They destroy some

06:21.760 --> 06:27.120
properties that were already there, right? Almost everyone has some examples.

06:30.560 --> 06:35.360
But you can bring chemicals together that rather than self-organizing to create higher

06:36.000 --> 06:40.080
ordered molecules with new thermodynamic properties, they have an exothermic entropic

06:40.080 --> 06:45.520
reaction and they drop to lower levels of organization, right? This is true at all levels,

06:45.520 --> 06:50.000
so it's not just relationship, it's specific kinds of relationship that maximize synergy.

06:50.800 --> 06:55.680
This is a key thing to understand about the nature of universe. It's also the case that if you bring

06:55.680 --> 07:00.240
the same thing together, a bunch of the same thing, you don't get very interesting synergies.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.760
You get very interesting synergies when you bring different things with different properties together

07:03.760 --> 07:07.680
in the right format where then you have the properties of each of those things and then

07:07.680 --> 07:11.760
the properties of the relationship between those, which is the new stuff, and you get emergent. So

07:11.760 --> 07:15.920
you've got hydrogen and you've got oxygen, which are different things and you bring them

07:15.920 --> 07:20.160
together and you get water on the basis for life, but neither hydrogen nor oxygen at room

07:20.160 --> 07:27.200
temperature or liquids, right? And so this is a fascinating thing. So we're actually very interested

07:27.200 --> 07:34.080
in having deep synergistic relationships with differences that lead to fundamentally new

07:34.080 --> 07:40.000
emerging properties. So it's not just net complexity, it's ordered complexity and it's

07:40.000 --> 07:44.720
elegantly ordered complexity. And then when you get a new property, then universe selects for that,

07:44.720 --> 07:50.000
right? That new property offers some evolutionary advantage to that system, that a system that

07:50.000 --> 07:54.160
didn't have that wouldn't have. So things can come together all kinds of ways, but the ones that

07:54.160 --> 07:58.640
come together most synergistically offer and confer the most advantage and universe selects for it.

07:58.640 --> 08:05.200
So universe is actually selecting for more differences, right? So it's selecting for diversity

08:05.200 --> 08:11.280
and then more synergistic combinations across those differences that, and it's both of those,

08:11.280 --> 08:17.200
more diversity and more unification across the diversity, right? More agency and more symbiosis

08:17.200 --> 08:22.800
at the same time is what defines the era of evolution. Does that make sense?

08:26.320 --> 08:33.600
Things that are separate autonomous agents, right? So like a cell you can think of as having its own

08:33.600 --> 08:38.720
agency, right? Its own ability to act and its own boundary and periphery. But you bring a bunch

08:38.720 --> 08:44.560
of cells together and this collection of cells can reflect on consciousness and existentialism

08:44.560 --> 08:49.520
and have a conversation like this, even though none of those cells on their own do that, right?

08:50.560 --> 08:54.880
And it's different kinds of cells. You couldn't do that with just neurons. It takes neurons and

08:54.880 --> 09:00.640
glial cells and immune cells and stem cells, et cetera, to all come together. So more agency,

09:00.640 --> 09:05.680
more differentiation, more orderly relationship, more synergy, all of that comes together and

09:05.680 --> 09:11.920
the net defining thing is emergence. How much fundamental new advantage arises and that's

09:11.920 --> 09:17.600
what evolution selects for. And so if it wasn't for this whole combination of things together,

09:17.600 --> 09:27.760
is this the message that says five minutes left? Fascinating. So I'll see if we can go

09:27.760 --> 09:31.360
very quickly through. That was the first one percent of what I hoped to discuss.

09:33.680 --> 09:37.040
So I'm going to just skim over the top of a bunch of topics and hopefully

09:37.600 --> 09:40.880
paint a gestalt at least of an arc that's interesting.

09:43.040 --> 09:49.760
So the evolutionary universe story, the kind of new best story of universe we have emerging from

09:49.760 --> 09:53.680
the intersection of all the sciences is that we have an evolutionary universe that doesn't

09:53.680 --> 09:58.960
require a creator agent, deistic or theistic God to create, but is also not just random,

09:59.520 --> 10:03.760
highly improbable set of movements that get us here, but there is a set of properties

10:03.760 --> 10:09.920
that give us a self organizing rather than creative agent, creative principle universe

10:09.920 --> 10:14.640
that is moving towards more elegant ordered complexity. And with that story on the physical,

10:14.640 --> 10:20.000
you also have the evolution of consciousness structures themselves, right? As you move from

10:20.000 --> 10:24.560
a reptilian nervous system to the increased orderly complexity of a mammalian and then a neocortical

10:24.560 --> 10:29.360
and then a prefrontal nervous system, you move from the kinds of sentience that map to that of

10:29.360 --> 10:34.720
pain, pleasure at reptilian to emotional to cognition to abstraction. So we have a universe

10:34.720 --> 10:38.960
that's moving in the direction of not only more elegance, but greater depths and breadth of

10:38.960 --> 10:46.560
consciousness itself. Now this defines an era of evolution that reifies meaning in a very interesting

10:46.560 --> 10:51.760
way. And one of the things that's so interesting is with our capacity for abstraction, we cannot

10:51.760 --> 10:55.520
just think about our experiential self of the moment, but we can think about ourselves in

10:55.520 --> 11:01.600
abstract terms. We can think about time abstractly, deep past and deep future, right? And that is what

11:01.600 --> 11:06.240
allows us to actually understand evolution itself. It's an understanding of deep past and fossil

11:06.240 --> 11:12.160
record and astrophysics that give us a sense of the ability to abstract laws of how that change

11:12.160 --> 11:17.280
occurs over time that allows us a deeper insight as to how we got here and then also the ability

11:17.280 --> 11:21.600
to vision a future fundamentally more beautiful and more interesting and then be part of that creative

11:21.600 --> 11:29.120
process. So it's worthwhile just noting that our prefrontal cortex and our capacity for abstraction

11:29.120 --> 11:35.040
is a pretty new phenomena evolutionarily, right? And it's also a very powerful set of capabilities

11:35.040 --> 11:38.960
and when you have a new phenomena that's very powerful, you're not going to know how to use it

11:38.960 --> 11:42.880
that well. Many of its applications will be destructive until you've figured out. So we can

11:42.880 --> 11:47.200
think about the future as worry. We can think about the past as regret. We can think about

11:47.200 --> 11:54.880
self abstractly in terms of negative self comparison. So then we have spiritual ideals emerge that

11:54.880 --> 12:00.880
basically say this is all bad, right? Mind and the ability for abstraction like this is bad.

12:00.880 --> 12:04.320
We should not think about the future at all or think about the past and just be in the moment

12:04.320 --> 12:09.120
like the other animals and children are see how happy they are. But it's a it's a regressive

12:09.120 --> 12:14.320
spirituality that is actually rejecting the fundamentally novel human capability that emerged

12:14.320 --> 12:18.720
rather than say let's learn how to use it well for its evolutionary purposes in a fundamentally

12:18.720 --> 12:24.960
evolving universe. So if we learn how to use it well, then we say how can we learn from the past

12:24.960 --> 12:31.360
how universe works to be able to imagine a future in an omniconsiderate way that is

12:32.320 --> 12:36.640
has fundamentally less suffering and higher quality of life across all meaningful quality

12:36.640 --> 12:40.960
of life metrics for all life, right? There's omniconsiderately true, good and beautiful. And then

12:40.960 --> 12:46.400
how can we apply all that learning now to actually help create that world? And in doing so we stop

12:46.400 --> 12:51.040
just being a part of the whole. But in our ability to think about the whole and think about the

12:51.040 --> 12:56.000
direction of the whole, we can actually become an agent for the whole. This is fucking huge, right?

12:56.000 --> 13:00.480
The B is serving this huge role in evolution by pollinating the plants that make the atmosphere

13:00.480 --> 13:04.080
that make us, but they don't know they're doing that and they can't consciously figure out how to

13:04.080 --> 13:09.760
do it better. But we actually have the capability of looking at what the whole story is and identifying

13:09.760 --> 13:16.160
as well the whole evolutionary impulse of universe brought me about and then woke up to itself in me.

13:17.840 --> 13:22.880
And so in a meaningful way, I am actually the evolutionary impulse of universe awoke to itself

13:22.880 --> 13:27.440
in a form that has adequate ordered complexity to contemplate that and then get to consciously

13:27.440 --> 13:37.120
choose how to participate with it to be in a not just a board spaceship earth but crew, right?

13:37.120 --> 13:42.160
To help steer the direction of evolution and cosmos. And so we move from evolution as a mostly

13:42.160 --> 13:49.200
unconscious algorithmic process that selects for dominance now to a process that can be mediated

13:49.200 --> 13:54.560
by conscious agents. They can actually forecast a more beautiful future and select to help create

13:54.560 --> 14:04.080
that. Does that make sense? So when we don't identify as evolutionaries, then we can be actually kind

14:04.080 --> 14:10.160
of we identify as nouns rather than verbs and we stay stuck where we're at and then we need pain

14:10.160 --> 14:15.280
as an evolutionary driver and then emergence through emergency is how we grow. As soon as we

14:15.280 --> 14:21.280
identify with the inexorability of evolution and ourselves as evolution incarnate, we stop needing

14:21.280 --> 14:26.640
pain to push us because our whole fucking purpose for being, for becoming, being becoming are actually

14:26.640 --> 14:32.400
matched. They're two sides of the same thing is the lure of the becoming is the bringing about more

14:32.400 --> 14:36.800
of the timeless properties of the infinite in time, right? More of the infinite through the finite.

14:36.800 --> 14:41.360
This actually becomes the basis of our existence and everybody knows that when you are in the

14:41.360 --> 14:46.880
experience of creating beauty that didn't exist before in universe that adds to universe that's

14:46.880 --> 14:50.800
uniquely yours to create, you feel a kind of aliveness that's not matched by anything else.

14:52.240 --> 14:59.360
In lieu of not doing that, the emptiness causes all kinds of addiction, right? Because that's

14:59.360 --> 15:04.960
fundamental to what we're actually here to do. Now when we all identify as evolutionaries, we

15:04.960 --> 15:12.000
obsolete the need as pain for a driver. Does that make sense? Because we have a pole driver rather

15:12.000 --> 15:18.160
than just needing the push driver. When we also identify as fundamentally interconnected parts

15:18.960 --> 15:23.520
of a interconnected universe rather than separate things, we stop thinking that there is any

15:23.520 --> 15:28.080
definition of success for self that isn't the definition of success for the whole. And we stop

15:28.080 --> 15:32.640
thinking that the idea of advantaging ourselves at the expense of something else we're inexorably

15:32.640 --> 15:39.520
interconnected to makes sense at all. So we are all agents for an interconnected whole where our

15:39.520 --> 15:44.800
sense of self is, our self is actually an emergent property of the intersection of this system with

15:44.800 --> 15:50.240
the rest of universe. It's actually key in terms of emergence, yourself is an emergent property

15:50.240 --> 15:55.840
of the whole universe. Because even though you wouldn't exist in the same way without your brain

15:55.840 --> 16:00.560
and your body, you also wouldn't exist without the atmosphere and the trees that make it and the

16:01.360 --> 16:06.720
plants and bacteria that make it and the gravity and electromagnetism and foundational forces like

16:06.720 --> 16:13.360
the concept of I separate from universe is a misnomer. Does that make sense? So the concept of

16:14.080 --> 16:17.920
a life path for our self that isn't a life path for universe is a misnomer

16:19.200 --> 16:25.600
or advantage for self. So then we get in the deepest sense when Einstein said the idea that

16:25.600 --> 16:32.000
there are separate things is an optical delusion of consciousness. And in reality there is one

16:32.640 --> 16:37.760
reality that we call universe of which we are all inextricably interconnected facets.

16:38.480 --> 16:44.160
And your experience of self is a facet of that. Now what's so fucking fascinating is that it is

16:44.160 --> 16:48.160
interconnected with all of it. It's an expression of the foundation of all of it and it's also

16:48.160 --> 16:55.200
completely unique in all of universe. It's a unique facet, non fungibly unique, right? What that means

16:55.200 --> 17:01.600
is you have something to offer universe in your experience and your creativity that no one else

17:02.560 --> 17:08.080
has to offer exactly that way which means if you don't offer it like if Salvador Dali hadn't done

17:08.080 --> 17:14.720
Dali, Michelangelo didn't do Dali, Escher wouldn't have done Dali, Dali just wouldn't have happened.

17:16.240 --> 17:21.840
And so universe would have been fundamentally less. So when you get that your own self-actualization

17:21.840 --> 17:27.760
is compulsory, right? You have an obligation to it but then when you get that everyone else if

17:27.760 --> 17:32.560
they don't self-actualize universe is less, your participation with helping everyone else self-actualize

17:32.560 --> 17:40.560
is also compulsory. So competition is an obsolete concept. Symbiotic to remember universe moves

17:40.560 --> 17:45.120
towards more differentiation, more novelty, and then more symbiosis across that novelty for more

17:45.120 --> 17:52.320
emergence. And what we're moving towards is a civilization where everyone actually identifies

17:52.320 --> 17:58.640
this way as an emergent property of the whole, as an interconnected part of universe with a unique

17:58.640 --> 18:03.760
role to play, with unique synergies with all the other unique roles to play. And then with that

18:03.760 --> 18:09.280
synergy, with that human participation, then humanity actually becomes a thing. It actually

18:09.280 --> 18:14.000
becomes an emergent property. Right now it's an idea but we don't have humanity, we don't have

18:14.000 --> 18:21.200
civilization, we have humans bumping, right? We have a bunch of organelles that haven't organized

18:21.200 --> 18:25.440
as a cell that starts breathing, right? You don't have behavior of the whole that is

18:26.160 --> 18:32.960
centrally and consciously self-organizing, but we can. And I would actually say, and this is what

18:32.960 --> 18:38.480
I wanted to have more time to get into, but to just foreshadow quickly, if we cherry pick

18:38.480 --> 18:43.120
from the huge data sets about where humanity is going right now, we can see that things are

18:43.120 --> 18:47.280
exponentially changing, which means changing at more and more rapid and more and more significant

18:47.280 --> 18:51.760
rates. And you can cherry pick metrics where things are getting exponentially better, and that's

18:51.760 --> 18:56.400
true, and other things are getting exponentially worse, and that's also true, which means the

18:56.400 --> 19:01.520
future that you predict if you just follow any of those curves is not happening. If things are

19:01.520 --> 19:05.040
getting exponentially better and worse at the same time, does everybody kind of get that that's

19:05.040 --> 19:09.680
happening on different metrics? Then that doesn't mean things are getting better or worse, it means

19:09.680 --> 19:20.400
the current system is destabilizing, and that means self-terminating, and then we either have a

19:20.400 --> 19:26.000
discrete phase shift to a lower order intropic system or the emergence of a higher order system

19:26.000 --> 19:32.480
that is foundationally different than the current system we have in every way. So the things getting

19:32.480 --> 19:39.200
better are the pieces that can be reorganized to create a new civilization with a foundationally

19:39.200 --> 19:44.880
new structure, right? Biosphere metrics are getting exponentially worse from misapplication of

19:44.880 --> 19:49.680
technology. Technology's right application are making things fundamentally better, but technology's

19:49.680 --> 19:55.360
giving us the capacity to do things like have data analytic capabilities to inventory all the

19:55.360 --> 19:59.840
world's resources, to then be able to allocate all the world's resources to meet all the world's needs

19:59.840 --> 20:03.680
with optimum efficiency, we never had that ability before. Like the transportation and

20:03.680 --> 20:07.760
communication technologies that can actually make us a global civilization, we never had that before,

20:08.400 --> 20:15.200
right? And so the technological capacities that require us to step up otherwise we, you know,

20:15.200 --> 20:20.400
self-extinction is a very real thing, also make possible a discrete phase shift in evolution

20:20.400 --> 20:25.360
that's characterized by three major things, and this will be where I end. At the level of social

20:25.360 --> 20:32.160
systems, primarily economics, the key shift we're going to move to is a moving from a differential

20:32.160 --> 20:39.120
advantage economy, it's defined by private ownership, valuation based in scarcity and

20:39.120 --> 20:45.120
differential advantage, to an economic system that is defined by making sure that the incentive of

20:45.120 --> 20:49.440
every agent and the well-being of every other agent and the commons is perfectly aligned with no

20:49.440 --> 20:54.240
externality, meaning we actually understand that it's an interconnected system, we identify all

20:54.240 --> 20:58.880
the externalities and internalize them so the system's actually defined by systemic advantage

20:58.960 --> 21:03.840
for the whole. This is not communism or socialism or capitalism, it's something that was not possible

21:03.840 --> 21:08.080
before to even anticipate, but it is how your body works, where none of the cells are

21:08.080 --> 21:10.960
advantaging themselves at the expense of the other, they're doing what's best for them,

21:10.960 --> 21:18.000
what's best for the whole, symbiotically at the same time, right? And so that's the key net shift

21:18.000 --> 21:21.840
at the level of macroeconomics and correspondingly governance in all of our social structures, at

21:21.840 --> 21:26.640
the level of infrastructure in the built world, we're moving from a linear materials economy

21:26.640 --> 21:31.360
where we extract from the earth at ever-growing rates unsustainably from finite resources and

21:31.360 --> 21:36.320
then turn it into trash, to a closed-loop materials economy where the trash is the new

21:36.320 --> 21:40.560
stuff, we stop extracting from the earth, stop producing waste, and we actually have a post-growth

21:41.120 --> 21:46.240
negative entropy, closed-loop materials economy, where we can live on-goingly at progressively

21:46.240 --> 21:52.080
higher and higher quality of life, sustainably with the biosphere. So that's the infrastructure shift,

21:52.080 --> 21:56.640
that's the social structure shift, and the superstructure, the memetic shift, is this awareness

21:56.640 --> 22:04.080
of all of us as facets of one integrated self-evolving reality, where the well-being of everyone,

22:04.080 --> 22:08.640
the well-being of everyone else, the well-being of the commons, are not meaningfully calculable

22:08.640 --> 22:15.600
separate from each other. Now what's so interesting is there used to be such a thing as local

22:15.600 --> 22:21.760
problems. When Gandhi was working with Home Rule for India, it was largely thought of as an Indian

22:21.760 --> 22:28.320
problem, and it didn't directly affect everybody, right? When people in the U.S. wanted to, or who

22:28.320 --> 22:33.120
founded the U.S. wanted to leave British Empire, there was somewhere else to go, and it was a,

22:33.120 --> 22:37.360
you know, a local problem. Right now when we deal with species extinction and ocean acidification

22:37.360 --> 22:41.840
and peak nitrogen, peak phosphorus, they're all global issues, and you can't solve them

22:41.840 --> 22:46.000
without China, and without India, and without the U.S., and without everyone participating,

22:46.000 --> 22:50.960
so the idea that we have local issues is gone. Our level of global infrastructure and technology

22:50.960 --> 22:56.160
is made to where we have all global issues, and they're actually existential. They are

22:56.160 --> 23:00.400
threatening of the biosphere. No one has ever had issues in the history of humanity that threaten

23:00.400 --> 23:06.560
the ability of the species to continue, nor did they have ones that they had to face eminently

23:06.560 --> 23:10.480
in short term, nor did they have the capacity to actually face those kinds of things, the data

23:10.480 --> 23:14.400
science, the technology that could build something fundamentally new. What that means is we have

23:15.840 --> 23:24.080
the most significant work that humanity has ever had with the most significant capabilities,

23:25.360 --> 23:31.200
which also means the most potential to impact the biggest picture that any humans have ever had.

23:34.160 --> 23:37.360
And it's easy to think about that, and then get caught back into like,

23:37.440 --> 23:42.160
shit you gotta do next as part of to win at the current system that is going extinct,

23:42.160 --> 23:46.080
but winning at a system that is absolutely leading the capability of life on earth to

23:46.080 --> 23:50.800
continue, winning at a dying system is not an interesting win. If you ever think about the

23:50.800 --> 23:55.920
definition of heaven, where you're in heaven, and there are people in hell, and you're happy,

23:56.880 --> 24:03.280
you have to be a psychopath. You have to be able to separate from the experience of other sentient

24:03.280 --> 24:09.360
things enough that you can be totally stoked with that level of suffering. Well, the idea in this

24:09.360 --> 24:13.200
world that the level of intensity of suffering that's happening can be happening, and you can

24:13.200 --> 24:17.040
just be stoked because you're killing it in your life, you have to be mildly psychopathic.

24:18.640 --> 24:24.160
If we want to not be psychopaths, then there is no definition for success for ourselves, it is not

24:24.160 --> 24:29.840
definition of success for everything. And now when we start really taking that seriously, fucking

24:29.840 --> 24:35.360
everything changes. And then you start saying, well, what can I actually do to make my life of

24:35.360 --> 24:42.240
greatest use to all life? And then your answer to that question, if you take it seriously and really

24:42.240 --> 24:45.760
study and really work on it, and don't just like, ask the question, get overwhelmed, give up, and go

24:45.760 --> 24:51.440
back to current stuff, your, your progressively better answer to that question will lead to the

24:51.440 --> 24:57.360
emergence of your life, meaning and Dharma and path, and correspondingly the emergence of civilization

24:57.360 --> 25:05.920
making it. That's it.
