1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Thank you for the opportunity to speak to all of you

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,440
and to share some work and get your feedback.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,840
So if anyone would like more details

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,280
or to get in touch with me, all the papers,

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,520
everything else is at these websites here.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,460
And so there are four basic points

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,700
that I would like to get across today.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,440
The first is that there are really

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,200
some very significant knowledge gaps

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,880
about the control of large scale anatomical homeostasis.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,880
And this is roughly, it encompasses our understanding

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,600
of the relationship between the genome and the anatomy.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,640
And I'll show you why things are quite puzzling there.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,800
And I will claim that fundamental advances

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,120
and new biomedicine are going to require

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,840
not only understanding the molecular mechanisms

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,600
that are required for this process to happen,

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,000
but actually also the decision making

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
by cellular collectives that is sufficient for it to happen.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,000
And that a key medium for computation and living tissue

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,640
is something that is called non-neural bioelectricity.

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,280
Now we've developed some techniques

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,000
to manipulate this layer of basically physiological software

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,800
and I'll show you why I say that.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,040
And fundamentally looking towards the future,

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,240
I will argue that cracking this bioelectric code

27
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,120
that will enable a kind of novel approach

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,920
using electroseuticals for applications in birth defects,

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,640
regenerative medicine, cancer and synthetic bioengineering.

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,320
And boiling down the whole talk into basically two sentences,

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,800
what I'm going to tell you is that like the brain,

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,040
your body tissues form electrical networks

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,320
that make decisions.

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,000
These are decisions about dynamic anatomy

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,800
and that we now have the ability to target the system

36
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,680
to control large scale editing

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,480
that can even override all kinds of genomic default states

38
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,920
with lots of advantages and opportunities

39
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,680
for regenerative medicine and synthetic bioengineering.

40
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,200
And I show you one of our five-legged frogs

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,320
to just point out that you're going to see

42
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,000
all kinds of weird creatures today.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,080
None of this is Photoshop.

44
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,000
These are all actual living things

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,920
that represent our attempt to test some of the models

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,600
that we have.

47
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,200
So let's look at these knowledge gaps.

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,640
If we think about what is the end game of our field?

49
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,760
Where are we going?

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
At what point can we all go home?

51
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,440
What we would like to have is something

52
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,920
that we call the anatomical compiler.

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,600
The deal is that you ought to be able to sit down

54
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,200
and draw the animal or plant that you would like to have

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,760
at the level of the anatomy.

56
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,120
So not at the level of pathways,

57
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,600
but at the level of final anatomy,

58
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,960
the way that we do with machine parts and things like this,

59
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,880
then you would be able to draw this three-headed worm.

60
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,120
And if we knew what we were doing,

61
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,760
we would have the capability of having the software

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,760
which would then compile this anatomical description down

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,680
into a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells

64
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,800
that would cause them to produce whatever it was

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,640
that you just drew.

66
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,920
So here's this three-headed flat worm.

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,640
Now, the reason that this is fundamentally important

68
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,800
is that almost all of the problems of biomedicine,

69
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,080
so except for infectious disease,

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,320
pretty much everything else, birth defects,

71
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,840
traumatic injury, cancer, aging,

72
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,600
all of these things would be solved

73
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,760
if we had the ability to tell cells what to build.

74
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,240
If we had the knowledge to control what it is

75
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,360
that cellular collectives cooperate towards building.

76
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,560
So all of these things are in some important sense,

77
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,760
problems of information processing.

78
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,200
How is it that cells work together to build these things?

79
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,320
And so, of course, we are very far

80
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,680
from having anything like this.

81
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,640
And only in a few very special cases do we know anything

82
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,720
about how to make specific shapes come up.

83
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,160
So let's think about why that is.

84
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,160
So where is anatomy specified?

85
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,040
I mean, we all start life roughly like this.

86
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,960
So this is a collection of embryonic blastomeres.

87
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,320
And then shortly thereafter,

88
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,760
you get something like this.

89
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,240
This is a cross-section through a human torso.

90
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,480
So look at this incredible invariant order.

91
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,640
All of these organs are the correct shape, size,

92
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,080
position, orientation, everything is next to the right stuff.

93
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,320
It's absolutely staggering amount of order.

94
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,280
And so we would like to know, first of all,

95
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,760
where is this information coming from?

96
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,480
We're tempted to say DNA,

97
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,720
but of course we know what genomes specify.

98
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,200
The DNA specifies proteins.

99
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,480
There's nothing directly in there

100
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,320
that specifies any of this.

101
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,080
So we would like to know how is it

102
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,240
that cells use the genomically specified hardware

103
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,400
that they have to know what to make.

104
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,680
And when to stop.

105
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,960
In regenerative medicine,

106
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
we would like to know if a piece of this is missing,

107
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,920
how do we get the cells to rebuild it?

108
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,840
And as engineers,

109
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,920
we ask what's actually possible to build

110
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,800
given any particular default genome.

111
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
And so the reason that in my group,

112
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,000
we frame this thing as a basically

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
a collective intelligence problem

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,480
is that individual cells are extremely competent.

115
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,080
So here you see one cell.

116
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,560
This is a single cell organism.

117
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,440
This is called the lacrimaria.

118
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,440
And there is no brain.

119
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,520
There's no nervous system.

120
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
There are no stem cells.

121
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,360
There's no cell-to-cell communication.

122
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,480
Just one cell handling all of its local goals.

123
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,560
So it's handling its physiological goals, anatomical,

124
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,720
control, metabolic, behavioral.

125
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,120
Everything is handled by this one cell in real time, okay?

126
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,200
And so the amazing thing is that these cells,

127
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,480
which are extremely competent in their local,

128
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,640
very small sort of environment,

129
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,160
when they work together to make a metazoin body,

130
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,320
they can work on much bigger goals.

131
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,160
So what you see is an inflation, not only of body size,

132
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,160
but actually of their ability to pursue states

133
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,680
in various kinds of problem spaces,

134
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,880
including anatomical morpho space,

135
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,600
physiological space and so on.

136
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,360
So a single cell can give rise to a collection of cells

137
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,680
that self-assembles into some incredibly complex morphology.

138
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,720
And we know that simply understanding

139
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,040
stem cell biology is not going to be enough

140
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,720
because here we have a teratoma

141
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,320
and this thing might have hair and teeth and bone

142
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,960
and muscle and skin.

143
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,960
And so the work of the stem cells has proceeded fine.

144
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,400
You have all your derivatives.

145
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,440
You have your various tissues.

146
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,280
What you don't have is this three-dimensional structures.

147
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,440
We need to understand how this works.

148
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,960
And in a standard developmental biology,

149
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,360
the story that we're told

150
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,040
is a kind of a feed-forward open-loop system

151
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,600
which is very much based around emergence.

152
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,640
So the idea is that there are gene regulatory networks,

153
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,400
so genes turn each other on and off.

154
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,280
Some of these genes are effector code for effector proteins.

155
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,880
So they are sticky or they diffuse

156
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,960
or they exert force or something like this.

157
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,240
And then there's this physical process

158
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,560
where all of these things interact with each other

159
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,360
and then through the things that are studied

160
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,960
by the science of complexity and so on,

161
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,840
outcome these amazingly complex results.

162
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,800
So like the salamander here.

163
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,000
So this now, the story is certainly true

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,520
in the sense that these things all happen,

165
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,560
but it's incomplete, I think,

166
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,640
and it has a fundamental difficulty

167
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,400
which is this inverse problem.

168
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
The idea is that if we're committed

169
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,560
to this feed-forward emergent story,

170
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,440
then making changes here require us

171
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,240
to exert our interventions down here

172
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,960
at the, for example, at the genetic level.

173
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,000
And that means that we have to try to invert

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,200
this process of emergence

175
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,080
which is fundamentally insolvable.

176
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,480
So most of these inverse problems

177
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,600
are just too difficult to solve.

178
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,720
How do you know what genes to tweak

179
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,200
to make desire changes

180
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,000
at the three-dimensional anatomy level?

181
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,080
So the current state of affairs is basically this.

182
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,600
We're very good at things like this,

183
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,160
at figuring out the lowest hardware level

184
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,440
of which genes and proteins interact

185
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,040
with which other genes and proteins.

186
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,600
But what we'd really like to understand

187
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,440
are things like this,

188
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,600
the ability of planaria to regenerate from pieces,

189
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,680
the shape of the hand and the shape of the foot

190
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,840
and why they're different

191
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,520
and what you would have to do

192
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,960
to get these specific shapes back.

193
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,120
It's very not obvious what you would do at this level.

194
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,240
So the amazing thing is that

195
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,640
some animals are very good at this

196
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,960
and their bodies show remarkable plasticity

197
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,720
in this kind of collective activity of the cell.

198
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,560
So for example here, this animal is a salamander.

199
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,040
It regenerates its limbs, its eyes, its jaws,

200
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,720
its portions of the brain and the heart.

201
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,080
So if they're amputated, they will grow back.

202
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,560
And what's cool is that not only

203
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,480
is this process incredibly flexible,

204
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,280
meaning if you amputate at the shoulder,

205
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,520
you grow the whole thing.

206
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,000
If you amputate at the wrist,

207
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,920
you start here and you just grow the parts you need.

208
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,440
But then it stops.

209
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,640
And that's the most remarkable part of all of this.

210
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,080
And so lots of people work on trying

211
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,480
to kickstart regeneration,

212
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,520
but actually how does it know when to stop?

213
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,200
Because when it stops is when it has built

214
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,560
a correct salamander arm, that's when it stops.

215
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,920
How does the system know

216
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,240
when it's built a correct salamander arm?

217
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,880
Now, it's important to note

218
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,280
that this is not just some weird quirk of salamanders.

219
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,600
So the human mammals can do some of this.

220
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,240
The human liver is highly regenerative.

221
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,280
That's been known for a long time, unclear to me

222
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,840
how the ancient Greeks knew that, but they clearly did.

223
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,520
The human liver is regenerative.

224
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,360
Deer regenerate huge amounts of bone

225
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,520
up to a centimeter and a half of new bone per day, okay?

226
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,000
Every day over a centimeter of bone growth.

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,280
So bone, vasculature, innervation, skin,

228
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,080
and even human children can regrow fingertips.

229
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,480
Usually it stops at a particular age,

230
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
but if you just keep it clean,

231
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,600
the amputation will give rise

232
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,880
to a cosmetically perfect finger.

233
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,320
So the champions of this process

234
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,080
are these guys, these are planaria, these are flatworms.

235
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,480
They have a true brain, central nervous system,

236
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,520
the same neurotransmitters that you and I have.

237
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,480
And the amazing thing about them

238
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,680
is that you can cut them into lots of pieces.

239
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,840
The record is 275.

240
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,520
And every piece will regrow exactly what's missing,

241
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,360
no more, no less,

242
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,360
to give you a perfect tiny little worm.

243
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,840
While the new stuff is growing,

244
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,120
the remaining tissue is actually shrinking

245
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,120
so that they will as quickly as possible

246
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,680
get to correct proportionality.

247
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,040
And the other thing about them is they're immortal.

248
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,880
There's no such thing as an old planarian.

249
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,320
So if you're interested in aging or these ideas

250
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,000
that things inevitably wind down and accumulate errors

251
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,680
and so on, planaria are telling us

252
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
that that is not absolutely required.

253
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Here's a life form that's basically immortal.

254
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,080
And the thing to understand about all of this

255
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,880
is that we really are,

256
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,680
not despite all the amazing progress in molecular genetics,

257
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,520
we're really not very far along

258
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,080
in understanding how the cellular collectives

259
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,480
make decisions.

260
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,680
And one of the easiest ways to see that

261
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,800
is to just think about chimeric organisms.

262
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,360
So here's a simple example,

263
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,440
which we're making in my lab right now.

264
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,840
Here's an axolotl larvae, axolotl larvae have legs.

265
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,120
Here's a frog larvae, a tadpole, tadpoles do not have legs.

266
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,800
And one can ask a simple question.

267
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,440
If I combine axolotl tissue with early frog tissue,

268
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,280
so in early embryogenesis,

269
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,360
I make a chimeric embryo, they're perfectly healthy.

270
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,240
These are, we call them frog allotls.

271
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,800
We have the genomes, we have the axolotl gene

272
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,440
and we have the frog genome.

273
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,920
And now we ask a simple question

274
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,440
to frog allotls have legs, right?

275
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,920
And even though we have all this information,

276
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,520
we actually have no idea how to predict in advance

277
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,080
whether frog allotls will have legs.

278
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,960
And if so, will they be made entirely of axolotl cells

279
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,240
or both types of cells or what?

280
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
So these are the kinds of things

281
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,280
that we would actually like to understand.

282
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,560
And one thing that's very important

283
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,520
as part of this process is specifically the algorithm

284
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,080
that enables robustness and the handling of novelty.

285
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,240
And I'll show you a simple example of that.

286
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,160
So we discovered this a few years ago.

287
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,280
So here is a tadpole and it has eyes here,

288
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,600
it has nostrils and a mouth down here.

289
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,560
All of these things have to move around

290
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,480
in order to get to a frog face, okay?

291
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,080
So during metamorphosis, the face has to deform.

292
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,440
The jaws have to come out, the eyes have to move forward,

293
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,760
everything has to move.

294
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,040
So it was thought that somehow what the genome did

295
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,080
was to give each piece of the face a particular direction

296
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,360
and amount of movement.

297
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,640
And that way standard tadpoles become standard frogs.

298
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,440
What we did was we created what we call Picasso tadpoles.

299
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,520
So everything's in the wrong position.

300
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,720
The eyes are on top of the head,

301
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,840
the mouth is off to the side, everything is mixed up.

302
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,480
I'll show you in a minute how we do it.

303
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,680
But the amazing thing is that these animals become

304
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,600
pretty much normal frogs

305
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,360
because all of these different organs move around

306
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,440
through unnatural paths and sometimes they go too far

307
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,680
and actually have to back up,

308
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,520
but everything moves around until it gets

309
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,280
to a correct frog face and then the remodeling stops.

310
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,760
So in fact, what the genetics does specify

311
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,640
is not a bunch of hardwired rearrangements,

312
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,960
but a system that executes

313
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,600
a really flexible error minimization scheme.

314
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,120
It's able to start off at incorrect or abnormal positions

315
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,640
and still get to where it needs to be.

316
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,600
This apparently matches William James's definition

317
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,360
of intelligence, which is the ability to reach

318
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,000
the same outcome despite perturbations

319
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,480
and starting from novel, starting configurations.

320
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,240
So how does this system know what a correct face is

321
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,920
and how do we get there?

322
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,720
So we've been thinking about this problem

323
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,480
and we would like to, my background is computer science.

324
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,960
And so to me, all of this looks like a problem

325
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,240
of information processing at different levels.

326
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,200
And what I would love to know is could we go beyond

327
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,640
the hardware and operating at this level

328
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,840
and ask about the algorithms?

329
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,720
How are these decisions being made?

330
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,040
What do the cellular collectives measure?

331
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,520
What are their modules or subroutines?

332
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,440
How are these global patterning goals specified and stored?

333
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,400
And in particular, how reprogrammable

334
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,720
is any piece of biological hardware?

335
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,520
So in computer science, there was this really interesting

336
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,840
journey that we took from, this is what programming

337
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,040
looked like in the 1940s and 50s.

338
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,000
In order to get the computer to do something different,

339
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,120
you physically had to rewire it.

340
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,480
You had to rearrange the hardware,

341
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,880
you had to move the wires.

342
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,480
But what computer scientists realized is that

343
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,480
if your hardware is good enough,

344
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,160
and I'm gonna argue that biological hardware

345
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,480
is definitely good enough,

346
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,120
what you can do is something really interesting.

347
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,200
You can reprogram the machine without touching the hardware

348
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,080
basically by giving it stimuli or experiences,

349
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,400
basically inputs.

350
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,000
And that will allow you to program

351
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,480
in a much higher level language,

352
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,680
where you're not drowned in the details of the hardware

353
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,080
or even the machine language,

354
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,920
which are actually able to take advantage

355
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,000
of some really high level types of programming strategies

356
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,560
to get very complex kinds of outcomes.

357
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,760
And I'm certainly not arguing that living things

358
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,440
are computers in the sense that they're,

359
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
of course they're not built to the same architectures

360
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,520
that our current computers are.

361
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,880
But this idea of reprogrammable hardware

362
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,880
and of controlling a system by inputs and stimuli

363
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,680
as opposed to physical rewiring is very powerful.

364
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,680
So what we try to do is to come up with a scheme

365
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,440
where there's more feedback here.

366
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,080
So that basically when the system is deviated

367
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,120
from its normal target morphology,

368
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,320
be that with injury or teratogenic drugs

369
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,360
or pathogens or whatever,

370
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,760
when the system is deviated from this,

371
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,000
feedback loops kick in,

372
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,720
both at the level of genetics and physics,

373
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,680
and we're gonna talk about this physical one here,

374
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,440
that try to minimize the error,

375
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,200
the delta between where we are now and where we need to be.

376
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,000
This is a classic homeostatic loop.

377
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,760
It's what the thermostat in your house does.

378
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,480
It measures against the set point.

379
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,040
And if error is beyond the tolerable amount,

380
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,240
it will undertake corrective action.

381
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,120
So several things to note here.

382
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,480
The first is that, of course,

383
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,920
feedbacks are not new in biology.

384
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,840
Everybody knows we have feedbacks.

385
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,320
But there's something different here.

386
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,240
The first is that the set point of this process

387
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,880
and every homeostatic system has to have a set point

388
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,000
towards which it tries to reduce error.

389
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,040
The set point here is not a single number

390
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,280
or a scalar like pH or a metabolic hunger rate,

391
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,280
is a hunger range or something like that.

392
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,520
It's actually a fairly complex set of information

393
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,120
that in some rough course-grained way

394
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,120
describes what a correct anatomy should be.

395
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,160
So it's kind of a complex piece of information.

396
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,320
The other thing is that

397
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,840
this is very much a goal-directed process.

398
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,280
Now, when I say goal-directed,

399
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,680
I don't mean something magical or mysterious.

400
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,800
It's goal-directed in the cybernetic sense.

401
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,640
We've had devices that are goal-directed agents

402
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,280
for since the 40s and 50s.

403
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,040
And all it means is that it's able

404
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,640
to execute this error minimization loop.

405
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,240
But the cool thing about systems that work like this

406
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,320
is the following.

407
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,680
When you want to change what they do,

408
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,040
you don't have to be rewiring the hardware back here.

409
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,720
If you understood how the set point was encoded,

410
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,920
you could change the set point

411
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,640
and get the exact same cells to build something different.

412
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,240
And that's the amazing thing about any system

413
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,400
that utilizes this kind of architecture

414
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,040
that you can actually make changes

415
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,480
without even necessarily knowing

416
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,080
how all the parts of the loop works.

417
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,080
All you have to do is rewrite the set point.

418
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,800
And so our strategy for some years now was this.

419
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,760
We tried to identify some of the mechanisms that work here

420
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,640
in particular, understand the homeostatic set point.

421
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,880
How does the tissue store the pattern

422
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,840
towards which it tries to remodel?

423
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,400
And let's rewrite that pattern and let the cells build.

424
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,720
And that's part of trying to decode this aspect

425
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,320
of the collective behavior of these cells.

426
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,760
So let's talk about how we've been doing it.

427
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,920
So we have started looking at something called

428
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,720
developmental bioelectricity.

429
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,080
And what I'm going to show you now are,

430
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,920
first of all, the methods.

431
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,440
So how do we do this?

432
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,560
And then show you some proof of principle application.

433
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,360
So why is this interesting?

434
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,440
And I want to point out at the beginning that,

435
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,440
all cells in vivo sit within this complex morphogenetic field

436
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,640
of information that tells them what to do

437
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,440
as part of a larger unit.

438
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,560
This information comes in many flavors.

439
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,640
So chemical, extracellular matrix,

440
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,560
tensions and stresses or biomechanics,

441
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,400
all kinds of things.

442
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,320
And of course, bioelectricity.

443
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,080
So bioelectricity doesn't do this alone.

444
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,560
It works with all of this other stuff.

445
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,600
I'm just going to focus today on bioelectricity

446
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,600
because I think it has a particular aspect to it,

447
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,760
which is that it's not just another piece of physics

448
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,720
that you need to know to understand anatomies.

449
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,200
It's actually a computational layer

450
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,120
that gives some privileged access

451
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,200
to the control of complex anatomical features.

452
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,680
It is the medium in which the computations are being made

453
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,480
to make decisions about the length and the size

454
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,320
and the shape of things.

455
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,800
And so accessing this bioelectricity

456
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,800
gives you a remarkable insight into what's going on

457
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,480
beyond bottom up molecular mechanisms.

458
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,320
So the kind of inspiration for how to think about this

459
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,040
we took directly from neuroscience.

460
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,760
In neuroscience, this story of course

461
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,840
will be familiar to everybody.

462
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,760
The hardware is simple.

463
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,160
You have a collection of cells.

464
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,280
Each cell has ion channels in the plasma membrane.

465
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,840
They set voltage values across.

466
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,560
That's the resting potential, which can go up and down.

467
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,560
And it can propagate to the neighbors

468
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,520
via these electrical synapses.

469
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,840
So that's what's there.

470
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,760
And those kind of networks underlie this amazing software.

471
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,760
And here you can see this physiology

472
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,600
in a living zebrafish brain as the fish is undergoing

473
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,240
whatever cognitive activities zebrafish can do.

474
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,480
And you can see here the electrical activity.

475
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,640
And the commitment of neuroscience

476
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,640
is that if we were able to decode this,

477
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,800
if we understood how to read this information,

478
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,600
we should be able to, through a computational approach,

479
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,040
we should be able to figure out

480
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,920
what the animal is remembering,

481
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,760
what it's thinking about,

482
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,680
what decisions it's making.

483
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,480
The semantic and functional cognitive structures

484
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,600
are to be read out from the electrical activity of the brain.

485
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,320
That's what we believe.

486
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,000
Well, it turns out that actually all cells do this.

487
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,720
All cells have ion channels.

488
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,840
Most cells have electrical synapses

489
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,960
known as gap junctions to their neighbors.

490
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,000
And we have undertaken this project

491
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,400
to try to do the same kind of decoding.

492
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,080
So here's an embryo.

493
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,960
And we would like to read all the electrical conversations

494
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,360
that bind the individual cells into a collective

495
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,880
that can undergo anatomical homeostasis

496
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,800
towards large states like build a limb,

497
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,920
build a kidney and so on.

498
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,000
And on the one hand,

499
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,560
it's strange and surprising to many people

500
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,280
to think about somatic cells

501
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,320
as having this kind of neuroscience-like aspect to them

502
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,920
as if they're processing information,

503
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,360
they're having goal states and so on.

504
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,800
On the other hand, if you ask where did neurons come from,

505
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,840
of course, they didn't just appear out of nowhere.

506
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
The evolution just speed optimized

507
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,600
things that cells have been doing for a really long time

508
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,600
since around the time of bacterial biofilms.

509
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,520
All of the components of neurons

510
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,120
that are really important for this,

511
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,680
the channels, the neurotransmitter machinery,

512
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,720
all this stuff existed even before multicellularity.

513
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,560
And even bacteria were using this

514
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,040
to coordinate information across the film.

515
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,800
So we developed some tools to study this.

516
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,760
The first is just how to detect and model them.

517
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,080
This is a voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye,

518
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,840
which basically just reveals in the living state,

519
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,960
non-invasively, so you don't have to poke the cells

520
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,360
with electrophysiological tools.

521
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,000
Every cell is now reporting around its membrane,

522
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,840
all the voltages.

523
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,640
This is an early frog embryo in time-lapse sorting out

524
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,160
which cells are gonna be left and right

525
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,000
and dorsal ventral and so on.

526
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,600
And in addition to that,

527
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,440
we do a lot of computational modeling.

528
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,640
So try to say, well, if we know what ion channels

529
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,080
and pumps are in the membrane,

530
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,680
can we explain why the voltage is the way it is

531
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,640
and why it changes as a function of time the way it does?

532
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,000
And so let me show you a couple of native bioelectrical patterns.

533
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,920
This is what we call the electric face.

534
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,920
This was discovered by Danny Adams in my group

535
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,960
and she used voltage dyes to look at the frog embryo

536
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,440
putting its face together, okay?

537
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,200
And so this is, of course, is a time-lapse.

538
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,520
And what you can see, this is one frame taken from that movie.

539
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,480
What you can see is that long before the genes come on

540
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,960
to regionalize the face into the eye, the mouth,

541
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,040
and everything else,

542
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,040
all of the bioelectrical properties set up a pre-pattern,

543
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,040
a scaffold that tell you where everything is going to be.

544
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,160
So here's where the animal's right eye is going to be.

545
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,840
The left eye will come in shortly.

546
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,440
Here is the mouth, here are some placodes.

547
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,760
This bioelectrical pattern

548
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,920
is a native instructive pattern for gene expression

549
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,800
and for anatomy.

550
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,600
And the reason we know it's instructive

551
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,080
is because if you go in, let's say with optogenetics

552
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,600
or with other tools and change this electrical pattern,

553
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,800
not move any cells, but just change the pattern,

554
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,400
then you can get, for example, those Picasso tadpoles.

555
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,960
You can move organs around at will.

556
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,000
And I'm going to show you that in a minute.

557
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,480
So this is a normal pattern that is necessary

558
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,280
for correct craniofacial development.

559
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,640
Here's a pathological pattern.

560
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,640
So this embryo was injected with a human oncogene.

561
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,120
And so something like a KRAS mutation

562
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
or something like that.

563
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,360
And here it's going to form a tumor, right?

564
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,280
And the tumor is going to start to spread.

565
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,560
But before that happens,

566
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,840
before it becomes histologically apparent,

567
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,760
you can already see with this voltage dye,

568
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,080
here are the cells that have depolarized

569
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,800
and shut off the electrical connections to their neighbors

570
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,680
in a way that's going to basically revert them back

571
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,960
to their unicellular ancient lifestyle.

572
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,520
Once you're electrically disconnected from this grid,

573
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,320
the rest of the animal becomes just external environment,

574
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,040
that computational boundary,

575
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,400
whereas before it was large,

576
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,520
it was a group working on a liver or a kidney

577
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,480
or something like that.

578
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,800
It now shrinks to the level of a single cell

579
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,320
and all your goals become single cell goals,

580
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,760
proliferate, migrate to where life is good and so on.

581
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,440
And this ends up being metastasis

582
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,120
and conversion of metastasis.

583
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,240
So this is a pathological pattern.

584
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,880
So what we then developed was a set of tools

585
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,200
that were designed to allow us

586
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,760
to manipulate these bioelectrical gradients in vivo.

587
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,480
So if we thought they were functional,

588
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,320
we ought to be able to control them

589
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,920
to get the collective to do something different.

590
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,520
And so this is important to say

591
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,600
that we do not do any external field application.

592
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,440
We don't have any electromagnetic components here.

593
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,680
There are no electrodes, there are no waves,

594
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,800
there's no magnetism.

595
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,680
It's all molecular physiology

596
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,960
and the way it works is you can,

597
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,840
you have two things you can control in any tissue.

598
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,560
You can control which cells electrically

599
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,880
coupled to which other cells.

600
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,400
And so we target these gap junctions,

601
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,720
we can mutate them, we can open them, close them.

602
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,120
Or, and this is basically synaptic,

603
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,240
the controlling synaptic plasticity,

604
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,920
or we can control the various ion channels opening,

605
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,400
again, opening and closing them

606
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,280
to actually set the voltage of the individual cells.

607
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,320
And this would be the equivalent

608
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,840
of some sort of intrinsic plasticity

609
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,400
if this was neuroscience.

610
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,520
And again, we can use dominant mutations of channels,

611
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,360
we can use drugs, we can use optogenetics, light and so on.

612
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,280
And so when you do this,

613
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,360
something very interesting happens now.

614
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,360
When I first, this was, you know, back,

615
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,360
while around the year 2000,

616
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,760
I was first setting up these tools

617
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,760
and we wanted to control these bioelectric states.

618
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,320
It was thought that resting potential

619
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,720
is a housekeeping parameter.

620
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,320
And basically the standard assumption

621
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,680
was that if we perturbed the cells would die

622
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,920
and you would get uninterpretable toxicity,

623
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,240
that was the thought.

624
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,160
So I'm gonna show you that,

625
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,720
in fact, that's not at all what happens

626
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,800
because these bioelectrical states are not just readouts

627
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,080
and they're not just,

628
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,920
just yet more molecular machinery,

629
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,880
but they're actually the information bearing medium

630
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,760
for these large scale modifications.

631
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,720
So one thing you can do is you can take some cells

632
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,520
in the frog that are going to become gut.

633
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,120
So they're endodermal cells

634
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,600
and you can inject one of several types of ion channels

635
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,920
that will set up or in this region

636
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,480
that's going to be part of the gut,

637
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,600
will set up a voltage pattern, a distribution of voltage

638
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,720
that's very similar to what happens

639
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,320
when the native eyes come in.

640
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,160
And sure enough,

641
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,400
if you recapitulate that pattern somewhere else,

642
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,920
the cells are using that pattern

643
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,360
to decide what they're going to build

644
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,040
and that pattern tells them to build an eye.

645
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,880
And here they go,

646
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,320
they will build an eye out of endodermal cells.

647
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,600
Now in the textbook,

648
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,640
we'll say that only anterior ectoderm is competent

649
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,080
to become eye up here.

650
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,920
And that's true,

651
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,560
if you use canonical inducers like PAC-6,

652
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,040
the master regulator transcription factor,

653
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,720
but if you go upstream of that

654
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,240
and actually re-specify the bioelectric pattern,

655
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,560
then you can induce these eyes anywhere on the tail

656
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,160
and the gut anywhere you want.

657
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,160
And if you make these tails, these eyes rather,

658
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,160
they can have all of the same components

659
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,000
that normalize have.

660
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,760
So they'll have lens and retina and optic nerve and so on.

661
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,520
And here's an interesting thing.

662
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,760
If you label the cells

663
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,920
that you've directly injected with the scion channel,

664
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,280
let's say we'll label them with beta galactosidase,

665
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,480
so they're blue.

666
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,200
And this is a cross-section through a lens

667
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,880
sitting out in the flank somewhere.

668
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,120
What you'll see is that there are two inductions here.

669
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,440
The first induction is by us

670
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,440
putting in imposing a particular bioelectrical state

671
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,200
that causes these cells to decide to become a lens.

672
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,400
That's the first induction.

673
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,840
The second induction is that these cells

674
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,760
with their aberrant voltage potential

675
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,800
actually recruit their neighbors.

676
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,600
The brown cells here, which are not labeled,

677
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,920
which were never directly modified by us,

678
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,520
recruit them into this project

679
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,320
of building this larger scale structure,

680
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,000
this nice round lens.

681
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,120
So it's a non-cell autonomous effect.

682
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,640
And when we see this again and again,

683
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,520
that there's this ability of these bioelectrical signals

684
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,040
to not just to specify cell fate,

685
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,720
but to actually specify organ type and position

686
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,760
and things like that.

687
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,840
So we can make eyes, we can make ectopic hearts.

688
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,240
Here's a secondary heart.

689
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,240
We can make limbs and brains and some other things

690
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,560
and then many things that we can't yet make.

691
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,680
Now, let's look at another example.

692
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,160
Here's a planarian.

693
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,000
And one of the most interesting things

694
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
is that if you chop off the head and the tail,

695
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,040
this middle fragment knows exactly

696
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,400
how many heads it's supposed to have.

697
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,720
It puts one head here.

698
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,080
It puts a tail here.

699
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,360
And the way it does that is because as soon as you amputate,

700
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,560
there's this voltage gradient that's set up

701
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,440
where the red, the depolarized region tells the worm

702
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,360
how many heads it's supposed to have.

703
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,080
So what we can do is we can go in and target this region

704
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,320
using drugs, using basically ion channel modifying drugs

705
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,400
to depolarize this region.

706
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,480
And when you do that, you get a two-headed animal.

707
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,560
These cells are perfectly happy to make a head.

708
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,960
The information of how many heads you're supposed to have

709
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,320
comes from this electrical gradient.

710
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,880
If you change the gradient, they'll happily make two heads.

711
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,520
You can make two-headed animals.

712
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,520
You can make no-headed animals.

713
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,400
All kinds of interesting behavioral experiments

714
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,720
to be done that we can discuss if there's time.

715
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,080
But what's important here is that there are much like...

716
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,120
There's no genomic editing here.

717
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,960
So this is purely physiological.

718
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,200
And not only can I ask this animal

719
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,640
to make a second head of the correct type,

720
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,200
I can actually ask it to make heads belonging

721
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,600
to other species.

722
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,480
So here's we started off with a triangular-headed worm

723
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,040
like this, amputate the head per-turb

724
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,000
for about 48 hours, the ability of cells

725
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,680
to talk to each other electrically.

726
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,880
And what happens is the electric circuit is unable

727
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,240
to settle to the correct attractor.

728
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,320
And when they do settle stochastically,

729
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,600
sometimes they settle to the correct shape,

730
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,560
but sometimes they make round heads or flat heads.

731
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,840
And in doing so, they recapitulate the state

732
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,120
of flat-headed species like this Pifolina

733
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,160
or round-headed species like this S-Mediterranean.

734
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,600
It's not just the shape of the head,

735
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,640
it's also the shape of the brain

736
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,520
and the distribution of stem cells

737
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,480
that is exactly like these other species.

738
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,120
Again, no genomic editing here, perfectly wild-type genome.

739
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,240
And these animals, once the electric circuit settles,

740
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,040
there's a good chance that it'll settle

741
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,120
into an inappropriate attractor

742
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,040
that's actually associated with a completely different head

743
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,520
shape that in fact other species are using natively.

744
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,560
Now, you can also knock the system into attractors

745
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,360
that are not being used to my knowledge by any system.

746
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,360
And you can really get far from the normal planarian shape.

747
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,960
You can make animals that are spiky like this.

748
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,680
You can make animals that are cylindrical like this

749
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,680
or a combination of a flat animal

750
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,760
with a tube growing out into the third dimension.

751
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,800
Now, I'm gonna show you in a minute

752
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,360
that what this is all about

753
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,960
is predictive control over large-scale anatomy.

754
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,960
This is not about making weird aberrant teratologies and so on.

755
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,400
The idea is that we can show how much of this

756
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,680
is actually under bioelectrical control

757
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,800
and then use computational techniques

758
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,360
to gain good predictive control over it.

759
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,920
And so this is a good time to think about the role

760
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,560
of the genome in the anatomy of this whole process.

761
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,440
The typical metaphor that we hear is that

762
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,720
the DNA or the genome is the software

763
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,640
and that the cell is the hardware that interprets this.

764
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,080
And that's not a bad analogy at the single cell level

765
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,720
when you're thinking about phenotypes of proteins

766
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,800
and pathways, but at the level of anatomy,

767
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,720
I would suggest a different metaphor.

768
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,360
And the different metaphor that works better

769
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,040
to understand anatomical control is this.

770
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,960
Actually, what the genome does is specify all of the hardware

771
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,320
that the cell gets to have.

772
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,120
So all of the specific ion channels that are here

773
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,160
are determined by the gene expression.

774
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,760
But we know from basic neuroscience

775
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,920
and also from computer technology

776
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,160
that if you make a very simple circuit,

777
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,040
this is a flip-flop circuit right here,

778
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,880
if you nail down the hardware,

779
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,280
what you can have is a circuit

780
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,760
that can store multiple different pieces of information

781
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,880
depending on the current flow through the system

782
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,640
and store it stably, which is a memory,

783
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,560
a flip-flop is a basic kind of memory.

784
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,360
And you don't need to move or change any of the hardware

785
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,400
in order to store a zero or a one

786
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,360
in this very simple electrical circuit.

787
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,840
So in fact, with our modeling,

788
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,480
you can see that the same thing is true

789
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,120
if you set up a field of cells with a particular

790
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,120
where every single cell is expressing

791
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,360
exactly the same set of ion channels,

792
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,800
what you actually make is an excitable tissue

793
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,720
where very rich patterning can take place.

794
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,440
It's a little bit like touring patterns, right?

795
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,640
There's self-spontaneous symmetry breaking

796
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,040
and self-organization,

797
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,400
but all of this happens with a completely constant proteome.

798
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,600
You don't need to change these ion channels

799
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,920
because they can open and close.

800
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,400
And so now all of the dynamics

801
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,080
are at the electrical circuit level,

802
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,040
not with the proteins underneath.

803
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,640
And so the prediction of this way of thinking about it

804
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,320
is this, you should be able to edit the software,

805
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,240
meaning change the information stored in the system

806
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,560
while keeping the hardware constant.

807
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,520
And in particular, just to remind you,

808
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,480
the piece of information that we want to change

809
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,680
is the set point.

810
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,920
We want to change the set point towards

811
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,040
which cells are working in this error minimization scheme.

812
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,120
So let's think about how to do that.

813
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,720
So here's our normal planarian.

814
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,320
We've cut off the head and the tail.

815
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,440
We got the middle fragment.

816
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,880
We perturbed the electric circuit

817
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,120
according to this model that we've developed.

818
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,000
And here's your two-headed animal.

819
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,960
Now we ask a simple question.

820
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,160
Here's our two-headed animal.

821
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:22,200
We give it a couple of weeks to get everything settled down,

822
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
cut off the primary head,

823
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,880
cut off this crazy ectopic secondary head.

824
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,640
Some people think, oh, you somehow epigenetically reprogram

825
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,680
this posterior tissue.

826
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,760
Fine, we'll cut it off, we'll throw it away.

827
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,400
All that remains is a normal middle fragment here

828
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,520
that didn't have any head tissue in it.

829
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,720
We do this in plain water,

830
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,760
no more manipulations of any kind.

831
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,960
The genome is wild type.

832
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,080
We haven't edited the genomic sequence at all.

833
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,080
So surely the prediction would be that you should have,

834
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,640
but you should get back to a single-headed worm.

835
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,080
Once you cut off this thing,

836
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,640
you should be back to a single-headed worm.

837
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,040
Now the interesting thing is that if you actually model

838
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,040
the state space of the electric circuit that's involved here,

839
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,960
what you find is that there are multiple stable points.

840
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,600
One is here, a very stable point

841
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,120
around the single-headed shape like this,

842
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,680
but there's another stable point

843
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,120
around the double-headed shape.

844
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,040
And so that suggests an interesting idea

845
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,920
that is it possible that when you amputate this thing,

846
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,320
the bioelectrical circuit will still remember

847
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,200
that it needs to make two heads.

848
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,040
And sure enough, that's exactly what happens.

849
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,160
When you amputate these in perpetuity,

850
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,760
as far as we can tell forever,

851
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,320
two-headed animals will continue to give rise

852
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,600
to two-headed animals,

853
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,440
even despite their wild-type genome in plain water,

854
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,720
no more manipulation.

855
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,560
And we can, in fact, if we want to,

856
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,760
we can set the bioelectric circuit back to normal

857
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,160
and it goes back to being a single-headed animal.

858
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,160
So a normal planarian body, as you're going to see,

859
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,960
is able to store a couple of different,

860
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,200
at least probably more,

861
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,760
but we've nailed down to ideas

862
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,680
of what a correct planarian is supposed to look like.

863
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,960
And this is how you can see this.

864
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,240
So here's a single-headed planarian.

865
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,120
And if we look at the molecular markers,

866
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,200
the anterior marker is here in the head, not in the tail.

867
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,120
And if you amputate,

868
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,280
you get a perfectly normal single-headed animal, fine.

869
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,320
Here's another anatomically normal animal.

870
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,040
Again, molecular markers are all normal,

871
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,000
anterior in the head, no anterior back here,

872
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,880
that no anterior marker back here.

873
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,800
But if you amputate this one,

874
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,200
suddenly you get a two-headed animal.

875
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,640
Why would you get a two-headed animal?

876
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,480
Because in the meantime, what we've done

877
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,800
is we've bioelectrically changed the stable pattern

878
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,120
to say, no, now you need to have two heads.

879
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,880
Now, here's the critical part of this.

880
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,760
This electrical map here

881
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,600
is not a map of this two-headed animal.

882
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,120
This electrical map is a map of this one-headed animal,

883
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,720
meaning that the bioelectricity distribution

884
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,600
is not simply a map of whatever the anatomy is doing.

885
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,480
The same single-headed anatomy

886
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,080
can store at least one of two different

887
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,840
stable representations of what it's going to do

888
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,720
if it gets injured in the future.

889
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,120
If you're interested in neuroscience

890
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,400
and how counterfactuals are remembered in the brain,

891
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,600
this, I think, is sort of the evolutionary precursor

892
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,360
to being able to remember things that are not happening now,

893
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,840
either things that happened before

894
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,000
or might happen in the future.

895
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,440
It's a counterfactual memory.

896
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,160
It's the ability to store a representation of a worm

897
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,480
towards which the fragment is going to build

898
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,600
if it gets injured.

899
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,040
So it sits perfectly comfortably

900
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,200
as a single-headed animal with this pattern until you cut.

901
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,280
And at that point, that memory is no longer latent

902
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,560
and it's actually becomes functional.

903
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,120
And that's how we get this propagation

904
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,440
of these two-headed worms.

905
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,520
So we are building some very sort of quantitative,

906
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,040
molecular, biophysical models

907
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,800
to really understand the state space of the circuit,

908
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,480
to understand how the circuit minimizes free energy

909
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,360
and eventually lands in one of these attractors,

910
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,280
hopefully the right one,

911
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,120
but not necessarily the right one,

912
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,400
and tying it into exactly the same formalism

913
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,400
for how people in machine learning think about networks,

914
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,120
electrical networks that can store patterns

915
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,400
and can actually repair those patterns

916
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,040
when pieces of the information are missing.

917
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,320
This is all very well-trodden ground in machine learning.

918
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,840
And we think that some of these same strategies

919
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,600
that we use now were discovered by evolution long ago.

920
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,600
And beyond worms, this is the beginnings of our roadmap

921
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,240
for regenerative medicine.

922
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,760
Because what we found is that, for example,

923
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,200
if you have a frog and the frogs do not regenerate their legs

924
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,480
the way that salamanders do, you amputate the leg.

925
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,320
45 days later, there's basically nothing.

926
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,080
There's no blastema and there's no regenerate.

927
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,880
What we can do is we can apply a cocktail

928
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,800
of ion channel drugs that serve as a stimulus

929
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,760
to kickstart a very complex cascade.

930
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,640
So what you see here is immediately the MSX-1

931
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,920
blastema marker becomes turned on.

932
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,760
The leg starts growing.

933
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,360
Already you have the toes and here's a toenail

934
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,800
and eventually you get a very respectable leg here

935
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,280
and it's touch sensitive and motile.

936
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,480
Okay, so the animal can use it.

937
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,080
There's a couple of interesting things about this.

938
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,080
One, is that much like when we created an eye

939
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,640
or induced a second head on the planarian,

940
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,040
inducing this leg, we don't provide all the information

941
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,200
to micromanage the process, right?

942
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,640
We have no idea how to build a planarian head from scratch

943
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,480
or how to make an eye or how to make a leg.

944
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,840
What we have found is a trigger for a subroutine

945
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,600
that this tissue already knows

946
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,960
how to do and the decision for what it's going to do,

947
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,960
scar or produce various types of organs can be,

948
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,320
is part of an electric circuit that we can guide.

949
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,080
We can manage.

950
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,600
So that's the first interesting thing.

951
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,280
The second thing is that in keeping with this idea

952
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,160
from the beginning that one of the hallmarks

953
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,000
of the collective intelligence of these cells

954
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,240
and responding to novel situations is that they can get

955
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,000
to the final outcome through novel paths.

956
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,880
And if you actually look at this intermediate stage

957
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,320
of this leg, this is nothing like what frog legs look like

958
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,040
when they're developing in the first place.

959
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,240
So it eventually gets to a very good frog leg shape here,

960
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,440
basically indistinguishable from the control,

961
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,640
but the intermediate path through morpho space,

962
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,280
the ability of the system to navigate

963
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,880
that anatomical morpho space is amazing

964
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,320
because it does not follow the same path

965
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,000
that frog limbs normally follow where they make a paddle

966
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,680
and then they, you know, there's apoptosis

967
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,760
that kills off the space between the digits and so on.

968
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,640
It's not what they do.

969
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,200
They grow, it's almost like a plant meristem

970
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,120
where you get the central stalk with this nail

971
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,240
and then off to the side, you get these toes

972
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,400
and eventually the whole thing remodels into a leg.

973
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,640
So the remarkable ability to get its job done

974
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,720
in a different way.

975
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,720
So now we, this is not just things that apply

976
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,280
to frog and worm, we've done some work with David Kaplan

977
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,520
and Lauren Black and others on human mesenchymal stem cells

978
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,960
and cardiomyocytes.

979
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,280
And you can control the kinds of things

980
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,480
that you can see in vitro differentiation,

981
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,080
proliferation, wound healing,

982
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,760
but I think that's not what the bioelectricity is for.

983
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,480
What the bioelectricity is really for

984
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,240
in terms of why evolution uses it

985
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,080
and why we should be interested in

986
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,600
is because it allows us to exploit the modular nature

987
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,400
of the anatomical decision-making

988
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,200
because we can control very large scale outcomes

989
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,440
not micromanage the details.

990
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,080
And here I have to do a disclosure.

991
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,160
So David Kaplan and I are both co-founders

992
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,000
of this company called Morphosuticals Inc.

993
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,480
where we're trying to take the things that we learned

994
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,280
about frog leg regeneration and move them towards mammals.

995
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,320
So our goal is where we're now in rodents

996
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,960
trying for limb regeneration using the same strategies

997
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,440
and using these wearable bioreactors.

998
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,520
And the idea is to again, kickstart regeneration,

999
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,600
not micromanage it, not try to babysit all of the

1000
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,000
different cell types and growth factors

1001
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,280
and everything else has to go in.

1002
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,320
But kickstart a trigger very early on

1003
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,400
and convince the cells with an aqueous protective environment

1004
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,240
that it's basically that regeneration can proceed

1005
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,280
in the way that it would in a salamander

1006
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,280
or in an embryonic mammal during this adult phase.

1007
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,760
So that's kind of where one of the research programs is going.

1008
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:42,120
I should point out this that it is already known

1009
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,000
how it is that voltage change impacts

1010
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,040
the transcriptional machinery.

1011
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,600
People often sort of say that it would be great

1012
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,400
if we understood how voltage controls gene expression.

1013
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,440
We basically do, we already know about six ways

1014
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,520
that voltage change transduces down

1015
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,600
into second messenger pathways and controls gene expression.

1016
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,400
And this has typical mechanisms like calcium,

1017
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,160
which neuroscience is very familiar with,

1018
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,360
other things like voltage sensitive phosphatases,

1019
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,880
neurotransmitter transporters.

1020
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,400
We already know how this works at a single cell level.

1021
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,040
This transduction machinery has been dissected.

1022
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,440
In fact, also some of the downstream targets

1023
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,480
have been identified.

1024
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,880
So the genes that are controlled by this,

1025
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,480
all of your favorite BMPs, sonic hedgehogs, FGFs,

1026
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,200
all of these kinds of things are in fact,

1027
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,840
the redistribution of morphogens

1028
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,920
and the examples that I showed you.

1029
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,800
All of this is known both from specific candidates

1030
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,720
and through unbiased, let's say RNA-seq

1031
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,760
and the microarray types of things.

1032
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,320
We know this, but what's interesting is that

1033
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,000
these answers as to how it works on a single cell level

1034
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,000
have been fairly unhelpful in understanding

1035
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,680
the large scale picture that we're really interested in.

1036
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,080
And it's very much analogous

1037
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,000
to this multi-scale problem in neuroscience.

1038
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,600
You can track the pathway and we do.

1039
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,080
And in every paper, you have to sort of go

1040
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,960
from the channel to the transduction machinery,

1041
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,120
which genes are downstream, so you can do all this.

1042
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,560
But that actually leaves open some much deeper questions

1043
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,280
about how the collective makes decisions.

1044
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,520
And so for that reason, we've made the simulator,

1045
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,960
and this was created by our center member

1046
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,760
and collaborator, Alexis Pytak.

1047
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,920
And what allows us to do is to build models

1048
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,600
of both molecular networks like GRNs

1049
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,240
together with the various biophysics steps that happen.

1050
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,800
And you can simulate every cell having these various circuits.

1051
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,440
And then you can try to build a full stack model

1052
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,720
that integrates from the molecular steps

1053
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,480
to the tissue level physiology,

1054
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,160
like every cell has various channels.

1055
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,480
What is the electrical pattern

1056
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,000
and they're gonna be in this tissue?

1057
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,840
What does that look like on an axial polarity level?

1058
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,640
You know, where's the head, where's the tail?

1059
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,520
And then can we extract from this

1060
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,800
the actual rules of the decision-making?

1061
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,440
Can we turn this into a kind of algorithmic description

1062
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,800
that looks like this that makes it much easier

1063
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,440
for us to control the process?

1064
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,720
Because now this is almost to like

1065
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,960
a high level programming language where we can see,

1066
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,480
okay, here are the measurables

1067
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,120
and here are the decision points that the circuit is using

1068
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,400
to control large scale patterning modules

1069
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,600
like make a head, make an eye.

1070
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:27,600
And so what we're doing is literally integrating

1071
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,080
every part of this so that you can build it up

1072
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,600
and then exert all your manipulations at this level.

1073
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,760
So you could have your simulator and ask questions like,

1074
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,680
why does the head-tail gradient rescale

1075
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,440
when you cut the planarian into four pieces?

1076
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,520
You know, how does that work?

1077
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,040
And you can't see that by drilling down into single cells.

1078
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,640
You have to come back out with that information

1079
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,000
and build these collective kinds of models.

1080
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,560
And the other nice thing about these models

1081
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,520
is that they are the perfect fodder

1082
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,040
for machine learning approaches

1083
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,360
to do two things, to infer better models from data.

1084
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,480
Okay, and we've done some of that.

1085
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,400
And also then to interrogate those models for interventions.

1086
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,200
And so here's some software that anyone can play with

1087
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,240
if you want to download and kind of simulate all this.

1088
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,840
And we've shown that you can actually use machine learning

1089
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,120
to find models that are really good

1090
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,560
at explaining functional data sets.

1091
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,640
In other words, you know, you did something to the system

1092
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,760
and then something else happened.

1093
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,480
What is a model explains that?

1094
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,480
And then find these kind of needle in a haystack interventions

1095
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,280
that are ways in which you could perturb it

1096
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,560
to get it to do what you want.

1097
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,760
Okay, so that I think is the kind of the future

1098
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,840
of using this for regenerative medicine.

1099
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,560
So let's talk specifically about a couple of applications

1100
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,280
in the last few minutes.

1101
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,920
The first thing is again, the cancer issue.

1102
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,880
So I've shown you that you can track the

1103
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,400
shrinking of these kinds of computational boundaries

1104
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,840
from data for the organ or whole body scale to single cells.

1105
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,400
And you can use this as an obvious application here

1106
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,800
as a kind of diagnostic modality, right?

1107
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,640
It's screening for cancer and so on.

1108
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,320
But functionally, what's really important is that first of all,

1109
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:23,320
you can induce basically a conversion of normal melanocytes.

1110
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,200
So here they are, these little black dots

1111
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,520
are pigment cells, they're melanocytes.

1112
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,320
If you depolarize a very specific cell population

1113
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,360
in the animal, not the melanocytes themselves,

1114
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,960
but a different cell population,

1115
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,360
we call them instructor cells for an obvious reason.

1116
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,880
They, those cells tell the melanocytes what to do,

1117
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,080
in particular to stay nice cooperative melanocytes

1118
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,320
under control, if you block their ability to signal,

1119
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,880
what happens is basically metastatic melanoma.

1120
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,000
These normal melanocytes convert to these crazy

1121
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,760
really, really kind of a long stringy things

1122
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,640
that start to crawl away.

1123
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,160
They dig into the brain, they dig into the neural tube,

1124
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,920
they start to invade.

1125
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,920
Here they are all through the blood vessels.

1126
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,560
This is basically exactly like a melanoma type of behavior.

1127
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,600
And you can see here, these blue cells,

1128
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,760
these are the ones that we actually depolarized.

1129
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,160
They are the ones that are now failing

1130
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,800
to keep the normal melanocytes behaving correctly.

1131
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,440
And the melanocytes are just at this point,

1132
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,600
they're going on their own.

1133
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,520
So it's a voltage change in the environment.

1134
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,640
There's nothing genetically wrong with these animals.

1135
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,480
There are no oncogenes.

1136
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,240
There were no carcinogens, nothing like that.

1137
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,760
But this voltage change is a physiological switch

1138
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,240
away from the cooperation of cells toward embryogenesis

1139
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,520
and towards single cell behavior.

1140
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,960
Now, what's cool is that you can override this.

1141
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,680
So if we inject an oncogene and they make these tumors,

1142
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,280
of course they're labeled with the red fluorescent protein,

1143
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,320
what you can do is co-inject the channel

1144
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,720
and you can force these cells

1145
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,640
to stay electrically coupled to their neighbors,

1146
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,960
despite what the oncogene is trying to get them to do.

1147
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,760
And here, while that dominant negative KRAS P53,

1148
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,800
whatever, while they're blazingly expressed,

1149
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,320
there's no tumor, it's the same animal.

1150
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,720
There's no tumor because these cells

1151
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,920
are coupled to this electrical network

1152
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,840
that forces them towards a proper tissue fate.

1153
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,840
So that's where our sort of cancer applications are going,

1154
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,080
and we've done this with light, with optogenetics and so on.

1155
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,800
And now we're in human cells to try to use this

1156
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,760
to target carcinogenic behavior in human cells.

1157
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,240
The other thing that is important is, again,

1158
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,280
to think about the level of control

1159
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,480
that's possible with this.

1160
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,720
Here is a normal tadpole brain.

1161
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,200
So you see forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain.

1162
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,960
And what you can do is if you, for example,

1163
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,080
introduce a mutated notch protein.

1164
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,400
So notch is a very important neurogenesis gene.

1165
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,120
You can mutate it and introduce a dominant mutation.

1166
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,320
You can see forebrain is basically gone,

1167
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,400
midbrain and hindbrain and just a bubble.

1168
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,320
These animals have no behavior to speak of.

1169
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,360
They, you know, they lay there, they do nothing.

1170
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,520
You can do the same thing with alcohol, nicotine,

1171
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,440
various teratogen exposures.

1172
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,840
What you can do is build a computational model.

1173
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,960
And again, this is the work of Alexis Paytak,

1174
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,560
Pay, who's a staff scientist in my group

1175
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,000
and a few collaborators.

1176
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,640
What you can do is you can build a computational model

1177
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,040
that asks a simple question.

1178
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,080
What determines the shape and size of the brain?

1179
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,040
And there's a particular bioelectrical pattern

1180
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,840
that's required for the brain.

1181
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,720
And then on these backgrounds of teratogens

1182
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,040
or even notch mutation, you can ask the model a question.

1183
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,040
You can say, if this pattern is disturbed,

1184
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,040
such as it is here, what channels would I have to open

1185
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,440
or close to get back to the correct pattern?

1186
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,480
And the model told us and it said,

1187
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,440
there's a particular channel HCN2,

1188
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,640
which can help us sharpen these boundaries,

1189
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,640
even though there are massive defects in the notch signaling

1190
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,480
and, you know, with these various other pathways,

1191
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,800
you can still reinforce these boundaries by opening HCN2.

1192
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,280
And sure enough, if you do it with drugs,

1193
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,440
or if you do, or if you just mis-express HCN2,

1194
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,640
you can get back to a normal brain shape,

1195
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,400
a normal brain gene expression, and in fact, normal IQ.

1196
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,920
These animals get their behaviors back

1197
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,920
and their learning rates back.

1198
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,400
So here's what this is.

1199
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,800
This is using a very specific computational model

1200
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,360
to rationally manipulate the electrical signaling

1201
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,480
to get back to a very complex organ morphogenesis.

1202
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,360
And so the whole sort of roadmap

1203
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,720
looks a little bit like this.

1204
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,640
If we already have expression data, profiling data,

1205
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,600
on which tissues in the body express which channels,

1206
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,840
so that's already known.

1207
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,080
This needs a lot more work,

1208
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,400
which is if you knew what the voltage pattern

1209
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,360
was supposed to be in various healthy tissues

1210
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,600
under various conditions,

1211
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,280
so basically physiomic profiling is needed.

1212
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,280
Then we have this computational simulation engine,

1213
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,520
which is able to say if you want to go

1214
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,320
from the incorrect pattern to the correct pattern,

1215
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,800
which of these channels would you have to open and close?

1216
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,560
Okay, and that tells you immediately

1217
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:16,120
what cocktail of ion channel drugs you would need to use.

1218
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:20,000
And so we've developed this pipeline.

1219
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,720
You can, again, you can play with it here

1220
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,600
and choose your tissue and so on.

1221
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,000
And the idea is that something like 20% of all drugs

1222
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,440
are ion channel drugs.

1223
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,720
And these things form an incredibly convenient toolkit

1224
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,680
of what we call them electroseuticals,

1225
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,240
because if you have the right computational model,

1226
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,840
you can repurpose these,

1227
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,760
which and the human safety data is done on these things.

1228
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,640
People already take them for all kinds of uses

1229
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,600
and they have a massive applicability

1230
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,440
in tweaking the bioelectrical signals.

1231
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,080
Now, another nice thing about this kind of approach

1232
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,760
is that once the bioelectric circuit has made its decision,

1233
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,320
the downstream steps that are in second messengers,

1234
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,240
then gene expression, everything else,

1235
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,560
you can be as long as you want.

1236
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,840
So for example, in the case of the frog,

1237
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,920
a one day 24 hour application of a particular cocktail

1238
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,560
gives you 13 months of leg growth, right?

1239
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:19,160
And you don't have to micromanage that whole process.

1240
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,000
It's just figuring out what electrical state

1241
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,440
is gonna shift the tissue towards a particular goal state

1242
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,640
that all of the cells are going to work towards.

1243
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,360
So I'm just gonna close here and summarize as follows.

1244
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,200
There's this really important layer

1245
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,320
of physiological decision-making

1246
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,880
that sits between the genotype and the anatomy.

1247
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,840
And it's becoming a really tractable target for biomedicine

1248
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,800
and also synthetic bioengineering,

1249
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,880
because we can now see how the electrical dynamics

1250
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,680
that are operating in that tissue encode

1251
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,040
particular anatomical layouts

1252
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,640
towards which the cells continue to build.

1253
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,120
And evolution apparently discovered very early on

1254
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,440
that this electrical signaling is a really convenient medium

1255
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,560
for computation and global decision-making.

1256
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,960
It's not an accident that all nervous systems use it

1257
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,760
and all of our computer technology uses it.

1258
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,960
Ion channels, especially the voltage-gated ion channels

1259
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,400
are basically voltage-gated current conductances.

1260
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,840
They're transistors, right?

1261
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,600
And that's a very powerful architecture

1262
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,600
that evolution found long before we did

1263
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,840
for forming feedback loops, memory circuits, and so on.

1264
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,960
And we think that cracking this bioelectric code

1265
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,920
can help reveal how cell networks

1266
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,200
make decisions in large-scale anatomy,

1267
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,920
not just how individual cells decide

1268
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,320
what type of cell they're going to be,

1269
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,040
but actually the real question of growth and form,

1270
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,200
where do these complex patterns reside?

1271
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,120
And we can now rewrite some of these patterns,

1272
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:50,360
such as, for example, in the planarian or in the frog.

1273
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,360
And new machine learning tools are coming online

1274
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,280
to help us design strategies

1275
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,440
for all kinds of applications.

1276
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,680
So I would like to thank the people in my group

1277
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,760
who did the work.

1278
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,280
These are all the postdocs and students.

1279
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,880
And others who did the work that I showed you today.

1280
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,560
Here are some of our collaborators

1281
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,840
who are working with us.

1282
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,640
Of course, the model systems that we work with,

1283
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,440
all kinds of animals.

1284
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,960
And our funders, very grateful to them.

1285
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,360
Again, Disclosure, Morphosuticals Inc.

1286
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,240
is the company for our frog limb regeneration work.

1287
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,640
And just in the end,

1288
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,080
I always like to show a video of these two-headed animals.

1289
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,440
The first time I reported these data at a meeting,

1290
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,400
someone stood up and said,

1291
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,400
that's impossible, those animals can't exist.

1292
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,120
And so now I make sure that I bring a video.
