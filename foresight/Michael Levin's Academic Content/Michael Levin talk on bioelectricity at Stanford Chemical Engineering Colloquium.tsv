0	4320	Thank you for the opportunity to speak to all of you
4320	7440	and to share some work and get your feedback.
7440	10840	So if anyone would like more details
10840	13280	or to get in touch with me, all the papers,
13280	16520	everything else is at these websites here.
16520	19460	And so there are four basic points
19460	21700	that I would like to get across today.
21700	23440	The first is that there are really
23440	25200	some very significant knowledge gaps
25200	28880	about the control of large scale anatomical homeostasis.
28880	33880	And this is roughly, it encompasses our understanding
34040	36600	of the relationship between the genome and the anatomy.
36600	40640	And I'll show you why things are quite puzzling there.
40640	43800	And I will claim that fundamental advances
43800	46120	and new biomedicine are going to require
46120	48840	not only understanding the molecular mechanisms
48840	51600	that are required for this process to happen,
51600	54000	but actually also the decision making
54000	57600	by cellular collectives that is sufficient for it to happen.
57600	61000	And that a key medium for computation and living tissue
61000	64640	is something that is called non-neural bioelectricity.
64640	66280	Now we've developed some techniques
66280	70000	to manipulate this layer of basically physiological software
70000	71800	and I'll show you why I say that.
71800	74040	And fundamentally looking towards the future,
74040	77240	I will argue that cracking this bioelectric code
77240	81120	that will enable a kind of novel approach
81120	84920	using electroseuticals for applications in birth defects,
84920	88640	regenerative medicine, cancer and synthetic bioengineering.
88640	92320	And boiling down the whole talk into basically two sentences,
92320	94800	what I'm going to tell you is that like the brain,
94800	97040	your body tissues form electrical networks
97040	98320	that make decisions.
98320	101000	These are decisions about dynamic anatomy
101000	103800	and that we now have the ability to target the system
103800	105680	to control large scale editing
105680	109480	that can even override all kinds of genomic default states
109480	111920	with lots of advantages and opportunities
111920	114680	for regenerative medicine and synthetic bioengineering.
114680	117200	And I show you one of our five-legged frogs
117200	119320	to just point out that you're going to see
119320	121000	all kinds of weird creatures today.
121000	122080	None of this is Photoshop.
122080	124000	These are all actual living things
124000	127920	that represent our attempt to test some of the models
127920	129600	that we have.
129600	133200	So let's look at these knowledge gaps.
133200	136640	If we think about what is the end game of our field?
136640	137760	Where are we going?
137760	139760	At what point can we all go home?
139760	143440	What we would like to have is something
143440	145920	that we call the anatomical compiler.
145920	149600	The deal is that you ought to be able to sit down
149600	153200	and draw the animal or plant that you would like to have
153200	154760	at the level of the anatomy.
154760	156120	So not at the level of pathways,
156120	157600	but at the level of final anatomy,
157600	160960	the way that we do with machine parts and things like this,
160960	163880	then you would be able to draw this three-headed worm.
163880	166120	And if we knew what we were doing,
166120	169760	we would have the capability of having the software
169760	173760	which would then compile this anatomical description down
173760	176680	into a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells
176680	178800	that would cause them to produce whatever it was
178800	179640	that you just drew.
179640	181920	So here's this three-headed flat worm.
182800	185640	Now, the reason that this is fundamentally important
185640	189800	is that almost all of the problems of biomedicine,
189800	192080	so except for infectious disease,
192080	194320	pretty much everything else, birth defects,
194320	196840	traumatic injury, cancer, aging,
196840	199600	all of these things would be solved
199640	202760	if we had the ability to tell cells what to build.
202760	207240	If we had the knowledge to control what it is
207240	210360	that cellular collectives cooperate towards building.
210360	212560	So all of these things are in some important sense,
212560	214760	problems of information processing.
214760	218200	How is it that cells work together to build these things?
218200	220320	And so, of course, we are very far
220320	222680	from having anything like this.
222680	226640	And only in a few very special cases do we know anything
226640	230720	about how to make specific shapes come up.
230720	232160	So let's think about why that is.
232160	235160	So where is anatomy specified?
235160	238040	I mean, we all start life roughly like this.
238040	240960	So this is a collection of embryonic blastomeres.
240960	242320	And then shortly thereafter,
242320	243760	you get something like this.
243760	246240	This is a cross-section through a human torso.
246240	249480	So look at this incredible invariant order.
249480	252640	All of these organs are the correct shape, size,
253080	258080	position, orientation, everything is next to the right stuff.
259040	262320	It's absolutely staggering amount of order.
262320	264280	And so we would like to know, first of all,
264280	266760	where is this information coming from?
266760	268480	We're tempted to say DNA,
268480	270720	but of course we know what genomes specify.
270720	272200	The DNA specifies proteins.
272200	273480	There's nothing directly in there
273480	275320	that specifies any of this.
275320	277080	So we would like to know how is it
277080	280240	that cells use the genomically specified hardware
280240	282400	that they have to know what to make.
282400	283680	And when to stop.
283680	284960	In regenerative medicine,
284960	286960	we would like to know if a piece of this is missing,
286960	288920	how do we get the cells to rebuild it?
288920	289840	And as engineers,
289840	292920	we ask what's actually possible to build
292920	295800	given any particular default genome.
295800	297800	And so the reason that in my group,
297800	300000	we frame this thing as a basically
300000	302000	a collective intelligence problem
302000	305480	is that individual cells are extremely competent.
305480	307080	So here you see one cell.
307080	308560	This is a single cell organism.
308560	310440	This is called the lacrimaria.
310440	312440	And there is no brain.
312440	313520	There's no nervous system.
313520	314520	There are no stem cells.
314520	316360	There's no cell-to-cell communication.
316360	319480	Just one cell handling all of its local goals.
319480	324560	So it's handling its physiological goals, anatomical,
324560	327720	control, metabolic, behavioral.
327720	331120	Everything is handled by this one cell in real time, okay?
331120	334200	And so the amazing thing is that these cells,
334200	336480	which are extremely competent in their local,
336480	338640	very small sort of environment,
338640	341160	when they work together to make a metazoin body,
341160	343320	they can work on much bigger goals.
343320	346160	So what you see is an inflation, not only of body size,
346160	349160	but actually of their ability to pursue states
349160	351680	in various kinds of problem spaces,
351680	353880	including anatomical morpho space,
353880	355600	physiological space and so on.
355600	360360	So a single cell can give rise to a collection of cells
360360	364680	that self-assembles into some incredibly complex morphology.
364680	367720	And we know that simply understanding
367720	370040	stem cell biology is not going to be enough
370040	371720	because here we have a teratoma
371720	374320	and this thing might have hair and teeth and bone
374320	375960	and muscle and skin.
375960	380960	And so the work of the stem cells has proceeded fine.
381360	382400	You have all your derivatives.
382400	384440	You have your various tissues.
384440	387280	What you don't have is this three-dimensional structures.
387280	389440	We need to understand how this works.
389440	391960	And in a standard developmental biology,
391960	393360	the story that we're told
393360	397040	is a kind of a feed-forward open-loop system
397040	400600	which is very much based around emergence.
400600	403640	So the idea is that there are gene regulatory networks,
403640	405400	so genes turn each other on and off.
405400	409280	Some of these genes are effector code for effector proteins.
409280	410880	So they are sticky or they diffuse
410880	412960	or they exert force or something like this.
412960	415240	And then there's this physical process
415240	417560	where all of these things interact with each other
417560	420360	and then through the things that are studied
420360	422960	by the science of complexity and so on,
422960	426840	outcome these amazingly complex results.
426840	428800	So like the salamander here.
428800	432000	So this now, the story is certainly true
432000	434520	in the sense that these things all happen,
434520	436560	but it's incomplete, I think,
436560	438640	and it has a fundamental difficulty
438640	440400	which is this inverse problem.
440400	442240	The idea is that if we're committed
442240	444560	to this feed-forward emergent story,
444560	447440	then making changes here require us
447440	451240	to exert our interventions down here
451240	453960	at the, for example, at the genetic level.
453960	456000	And that means that we have to try to invert
456000	457200	this process of emergence
457200	460080	which is fundamentally insolvable.
460080	461480	So most of these inverse problems
461480	463600	are just too difficult to solve.
463600	465720	How do you know what genes to tweak
465720	467200	to make desire changes
467200	470000	at the three-dimensional anatomy level?
470000	473080	So the current state of affairs is basically this.
473080	474600	We're very good at things like this,
474600	477160	at figuring out the lowest hardware level
477160	479440	of which genes and proteins interact
479440	481040	with which other genes and proteins.
481040	482600	But what we'd really like to understand
482600	483440	are things like this,
483440	486600	the ability of planaria to regenerate from pieces,
486600	489680	the shape of the hand and the shape of the foot
489680	490840	and why they're different
490840	492520	and what you would have to do
492520	494960	to get these specific shapes back.
494960	498120	It's very not obvious what you would do at this level.
498120	500240	So the amazing thing is that
500240	502640	some animals are very good at this
502640	505960	and their bodies show remarkable plasticity
505960	508720	in this kind of collective activity of the cell.
508720	511560	So for example here, this animal is a salamander.
511560	515040	It regenerates its limbs, its eyes, its jaws,
515040	517720	its portions of the brain and the heart.
517720	520080	So if they're amputated, they will grow back.
520080	523560	And what's cool is that not only
523560	525480	is this process incredibly flexible,
525480	527280	meaning if you amputate at the shoulder,
527280	528520	you grow the whole thing.
528520	530000	If you amputate at the wrist,
530000	532920	you start here and you just grow the parts you need.
532920	534440	But then it stops.
534440	536640	And that's the most remarkable part of all of this.
536640	538080	And so lots of people work on trying
538080	539480	to kickstart regeneration,
539480	541520	but actually how does it know when to stop?
541520	543200	Because when it stops is when it has built
543200	545560	a correct salamander arm, that's when it stops.
545560	546920	How does the system know
546920	549240	when it's built a correct salamander arm?
549240	550880	Now, it's important to note
550880	554280	that this is not just some weird quirk of salamanders.
554280	557600	So the human mammals can do some of this.
557600	559240	The human liver is highly regenerative.
559240	561280	That's been known for a long time, unclear to me
561280	563840	how the ancient Greeks knew that, but they clearly did.
563880	565520	The human liver is regenerative.
566440	570360	Deer regenerate huge amounts of bone
570360	573520	up to a centimeter and a half of new bone per day, okay?
573520	576000	Every day over a centimeter of bone growth.
576000	580280	So bone, vasculature, innervation, skin,
580280	583080	and even human children can regrow fingertips.
583080	585480	Usually it stops at a particular age,
585480	586480	but if you just keep it clean,
586480	587600	the amputation will give rise
587600	589880	to a cosmetically perfect finger.
589880	593320	So the champions of this process
593640	596080	are these guys, these are planaria, these are flatworms.
596080	598480	They have a true brain, central nervous system,
598480	601520	the same neurotransmitters that you and I have.
601520	603480	And the amazing thing about them
603480	605680	is that you can cut them into lots of pieces.
605680	607840	The record is 275.
607840	611520	And every piece will regrow exactly what's missing,
611520	612360	no more, no less,
612360	614360	to give you a perfect tiny little worm.
614360	615840	While the new stuff is growing,
615840	618120	the remaining tissue is actually shrinking
618120	621120	so that they will as quickly as possible
621120	623680	get to correct proportionality.
623680	626040	And the other thing about them is they're immortal.
626040	627880	There's no such thing as an old planarian.
627880	630320	So if you're interested in aging or these ideas
630320	633000	that things inevitably wind down and accumulate errors
633000	635680	and so on, planaria are telling us
635680	637600	that that is not absolutely required.
637600	640600	Here's a life form that's basically immortal.
640600	644080	And the thing to understand about all of this
644080	646880	is that we really are,
646880	649680	not despite all the amazing progress in molecular genetics,
649680	651520	we're really not very far along
651520	654080	in understanding how the cellular collectives
654080	655480	make decisions.
655480	657680	And one of the easiest ways to see that
657680	660800	is to just think about chimeric organisms.
660800	662360	So here's a simple example,
662360	664440	which we're making in my lab right now.
664440	667840	Here's an axolotl larvae, axolotl larvae have legs.
667840	671120	Here's a frog larvae, a tadpole, tadpoles do not have legs.
671120	672800	And one can ask a simple question.
672800	677440	If I combine axolotl tissue with early frog tissue,
677440	679280	so in early embryogenesis,
679280	682360	I make a chimeric embryo, they're perfectly healthy.
682360	684240	These are, we call them frog allotls.
684240	686800	We have the genomes, we have the axolotl gene
686800	688440	and we have the frog genome.
688440	689920	And now we ask a simple question
689920	692440	to frog allotls have legs, right?
692440	693920	And even though we have all this information,
693920	696520	we actually have no idea how to predict in advance
696520	698080	whether frog allotls will have legs.
698080	700960	And if so, will they be made entirely of axolotl cells
700960	703240	or both types of cells or what?
703240	704240	So these are the kinds of things
704240	707280	that we would actually like to understand.
707280	709560	And one thing that's very important
709560	712520	as part of this process is specifically the algorithm
712520	716080	that enables robustness and the handling of novelty.
716080	718240	And I'll show you a simple example of that.
718240	720160	So we discovered this a few years ago.
720160	724280	So here is a tadpole and it has eyes here,
724280	726600	it has nostrils and a mouth down here.
726600	728560	All of these things have to move around
728560	730480	in order to get to a frog face, okay?
730480	733080	So during metamorphosis, the face has to deform.
733080	735440	The jaws have to come out, the eyes have to move forward,
735440	736760	everything has to move.
736760	740040	So it was thought that somehow what the genome did
740040	744080	was to give each piece of the face a particular direction
744080	745360	and amount of movement.
745360	748640	And that way standard tadpoles become standard frogs.
748640	751440	What we did was we created what we call Picasso tadpoles.
751440	753520	So everything's in the wrong position.
753520	754720	The eyes are on top of the head,
754720	758840	the mouth is off to the side, everything is mixed up.
758840	760480	I'll show you in a minute how we do it.
760480	763680	But the amazing thing is that these animals become
763680	765600	pretty much normal frogs
765600	768360	because all of these different organs move around
768360	771440	through unnatural paths and sometimes they go too far
771440	772680	and actually have to back up,
772680	774520	but everything moves around until it gets
774520	778280	to a correct frog face and then the remodeling stops.
778280	780760	So in fact, what the genetics does specify
780760	783640	is not a bunch of hardwired rearrangements,
783640	784960	but a system that executes
784960	787600	a really flexible error minimization scheme.
787600	792120	It's able to start off at incorrect or abnormal positions
792120	794640	and still get to where it needs to be.
794640	797600	This apparently matches William James's definition
797600	800360	of intelligence, which is the ability to reach
800360	803000	the same outcome despite perturbations
803000	806480	and starting from novel, starting configurations.
806480	810240	So how does this system know what a correct face is
810240	811920	and how do we get there?
811920	814720	So we've been thinking about this problem
814720	817480	and we would like to, my background is computer science.
817480	819960	And so to me, all of this looks like a problem
819960	822240	of information processing at different levels.
822280	827200	And what I would love to know is could we go beyond
827200	829640	the hardware and operating at this level
829640	830840	and ask about the algorithms?
830840	832720	How are these decisions being made?
832720	835040	What do the cellular collectives measure?
835040	838520	What are their modules or subroutines?
838520	842440	How are these global patterning goals specified and stored?
842440	844400	And in particular, how reprogrammable
844400	846720	is any piece of biological hardware?
846720	849520	So in computer science, there was this really interesting
849520	852840	journey that we took from, this is what programming
852840	855040	looked like in the 1940s and 50s.
855040	858000	In order to get the computer to do something different,
858000	860120	you physically had to rewire it.
860120	861480	You had to rearrange the hardware,
861480	862880	you had to move the wires.
862880	865480	But what computer scientists realized is that
865480	867480	if your hardware is good enough,
867480	869160	and I'm gonna argue that biological hardware
869160	870480	is definitely good enough,
870480	872120	what you can do is something really interesting.
872120	875200	You can reprogram the machine without touching the hardware
875200	878080	basically by giving it stimuli or experiences,
878080	879400	basically inputs.
879400	881000	And that will allow you to program
881000	882480	in a much higher level language,
882480	885680	where you're not drowned in the details of the hardware
885680	887080	or even the machine language,
887080	888920	which are actually able to take advantage
888920	893000	of some really high level types of programming strategies
894120	896560	to get very complex kinds of outcomes.
896560	898760	And I'm certainly not arguing that living things
898760	901440	are computers in the sense that they're,
901440	903440	of course they're not built to the same architectures
903440	905520	that our current computers are.
905520	907880	But this idea of reprogrammable hardware
907880	912880	and of controlling a system by inputs and stimuli
912920	915680	as opposed to physical rewiring is very powerful.
915680	920680	So what we try to do is to come up with a scheme
920760	923440	where there's more feedback here.
923440	926080	So that basically when the system is deviated
926080	928120	from its normal target morphology,
928120	931320	be that with injury or teratogenic drugs
931320	934360	or pathogens or whatever,
934360	936760	when the system is deviated from this,
936800	938000	feedback loops kick in,
938000	939720	both at the level of genetics and physics,
939720	941680	and we're gonna talk about this physical one here,
941680	943440	that try to minimize the error,
943440	946200	the delta between where we are now and where we need to be.
946200	948000	This is a classic homeostatic loop.
948000	949760	It's what the thermostat in your house does.
949760	951480	It measures against the set point.
951480	954040	And if error is beyond the tolerable amount,
954040	956240	it will undertake corrective action.
956240	959120	So several things to note here.
959120	960480	The first is that, of course,
960480	961920	feedbacks are not new in biology.
961920	963840	Everybody knows we have feedbacks.
963840	965320	But there's something different here.
965320	968240	The first is that the set point of this process
968240	970880	and every homeostatic system has to have a set point
970880	973000	towards which it tries to reduce error.
973000	975040	The set point here is not a single number
975040	979280	or a scalar like pH or a metabolic hunger rate,
979280	982280	is a hunger range or something like that.
982280	985520	It's actually a fairly complex set of information
985520	988120	that in some rough course-grained way
988120	991120	describes what a correct anatomy should be.
991120	993160	So it's kind of a complex piece of information.
993160	994320	The other thing is that
994320	996840	this is very much a goal-directed process.
996840	998280	Now, when I say goal-directed,
998280	1001680	I don't mean something magical or mysterious.
1001680	1003800	It's goal-directed in the cybernetic sense.
1003800	1006640	We've had devices that are goal-directed agents
1006640	1009280	for since the 40s and 50s.
1009280	1011040	And all it means is that it's able
1011040	1013640	to execute this error minimization loop.
1013640	1016240	But the cool thing about systems that work like this
1016240	1017320	is the following.
1017320	1019680	When you want to change what they do,
1019680	1023040	you don't have to be rewiring the hardware back here.
1023040	1025720	If you understood how the set point was encoded,
1025720	1026920	you could change the set point
1026920	1029640	and get the exact same cells to build something different.
1029640	1033240	And that's the amazing thing about any system
1033240	1035400	that utilizes this kind of architecture
1035400	1037040	that you can actually make changes
1037040	1038480	without even necessarily knowing
1038480	1040080	how all the parts of the loop works.
1040080	1044080	All you have to do is rewrite the set point.
1044080	1047800	And so our strategy for some years now was this.
1047800	1051760	We tried to identify some of the mechanisms that work here
1051760	1054640	in particular, understand the homeostatic set point.
1054640	1056880	How does the tissue store the pattern
1056880	1058840	towards which it tries to remodel?
1058840	1062400	And let's rewrite that pattern and let the cells build.
1062400	1066720	And that's part of trying to decode this aspect
1066720	1070320	of the collective behavior of these cells.
1070320	1072760	So let's talk about how we've been doing it.
1072760	1076920	So we have started looking at something called
1076920	1078720	developmental bioelectricity.
1078720	1081080	And what I'm going to show you now are,
1081080	1081920	first of all, the methods.
1081920	1083440	So how do we do this?
1083440	1086560	And then show you some proof of principle application.
1086560	1088360	So why is this interesting?
1088360	1091440	And I want to point out at the beginning that,
1091440	1096440	all cells in vivo sit within this complex morphogenetic field
1096600	1098640	of information that tells them what to do
1098640	1100440	as part of a larger unit.
1100440	1102560	This information comes in many flavors.
1102560	1104640	So chemical, extracellular matrix,
1104640	1107560	tensions and stresses or biomechanics,
1107560	1108400	all kinds of things.
1108400	1109320	And of course, bioelectricity.
1109320	1112080	So bioelectricity doesn't do this alone.
1112080	1113560	It works with all of this other stuff.
1113560	1115600	I'm just going to focus today on bioelectricity
1115600	1120600	because I think it has a particular aspect to it,
1120720	1123760	which is that it's not just another piece of physics
1123760	1126720	that you need to know to understand anatomies.
1126720	1129200	It's actually a computational layer
1129200	1131120	that gives some privileged access
1131120	1134200	to the control of complex anatomical features.
1134200	1137680	It is the medium in which the computations are being made
1137680	1140480	to make decisions about the length and the size
1140480	1141320	and the shape of things.
1141320	1143800	And so accessing this bioelectricity
1143800	1148800	gives you a remarkable insight into what's going on
1149520	1153480	beyond bottom up molecular mechanisms.
1153480	1158320	So the kind of inspiration for how to think about this
1158320	1161040	we took directly from neuroscience.
1161040	1163760	In neuroscience, this story of course
1163760	1164840	will be familiar to everybody.
1164840	1166760	The hardware is simple.
1166760	1169160	You have a collection of cells.
1169160	1172280	Each cell has ion channels in the plasma membrane.
1172280	1174840	They set voltage values across.
1174840	1177560	That's the resting potential, which can go up and down.
1177560	1179560	And it can propagate to the neighbors
1179560	1181520	via these electrical synapses.
1181520	1183840	So that's what's there.
1183840	1188760	And those kind of networks underlie this amazing software.
1188760	1191760	And here you can see this physiology
1191760	1195600	in a living zebrafish brain as the fish is undergoing
1195600	1198240	whatever cognitive activities zebrafish can do.
1198240	1202480	And you can see here the electrical activity.
1202480	1204640	And the commitment of neuroscience
1204640	1207640	is that if we were able to decode this,
1207640	1209800	if we understood how to read this information,
1209800	1212600	we should be able to, through a computational approach,
1212600	1214040	we should be able to figure out
1214040	1215920	what the animal is remembering,
1215920	1216760	what it's thinking about,
1216760	1218680	what decisions it's making.
1218680	1222480	The semantic and functional cognitive structures
1222520	1225600	are to be read out from the electrical activity of the brain.
1225600	1227320	That's what we believe.
1227320	1231000	Well, it turns out that actually all cells do this.
1231000	1232720	All cells have ion channels.
1232720	1234840	Most cells have electrical synapses
1234840	1236960	known as gap junctions to their neighbors.
1236960	1241000	And we have undertaken this project
1241000	1243400	to try to do the same kind of decoding.
1243400	1245080	So here's an embryo.
1245080	1247960	And we would like to read all the electrical conversations
1247960	1251360	that bind the individual cells into a collective
1251360	1255880	that can undergo anatomical homeostasis
1255880	1258800	towards large states like build a limb,
1258800	1260920	build a kidney and so on.
1260920	1262000	And on the one hand,
1262000	1264560	it's strange and surprising to many people
1264560	1266280	to think about somatic cells
1266280	1270320	as having this kind of neuroscience-like aspect to them
1270320	1271920	as if they're processing information,
1271920	1274360	they're having goal states and so on.
1274360	1276800	On the other hand, if you ask where did neurons come from,
1276800	1278840	of course, they didn't just appear out of nowhere.
1279840	1281840	The evolution just speed optimized
1281840	1284600	things that cells have been doing for a really long time
1284600	1287600	since around the time of bacterial biofilms.
1287600	1290520	All of the components of neurons
1290520	1292120	that are really important for this,
1292120	1294680	the channels, the neurotransmitter machinery,
1294680	1298720	all this stuff existed even before multicellularity.
1298720	1300560	And even bacteria were using this
1300560	1304040	to coordinate information across the film.
1304040	1306800	So we developed some tools to study this.
1307640	1310760	The first is just how to detect and model them.
1310760	1314080	This is a voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye,
1314080	1317840	which basically just reveals in the living state,
1317840	1319960	non-invasively, so you don't have to poke the cells
1319960	1323360	with electrophysiological tools.
1323360	1326000	Every cell is now reporting around its membrane,
1326000	1326840	all the voltages.
1326840	1331640	This is an early frog embryo in time-lapse sorting out
1331640	1333160	which cells are gonna be left and right
1333160	1335000	and dorsal ventral and so on.
1335000	1336600	And in addition to that,
1336600	1338440	we do a lot of computational modeling.
1338440	1341640	So try to say, well, if we know what ion channels
1341640	1343080	and pumps are in the membrane,
1343080	1345680	can we explain why the voltage is the way it is
1345680	1348640	and why it changes as a function of time the way it does?
1348640	1352000	And so let me show you a couple of native bioelectrical patterns.
1352000	1353920	This is what we call the electric face.
1353920	1356920	This was discovered by Danny Adams in my group
1356920	1360960	and she used voltage dyes to look at the frog embryo
1360960	1362440	putting its face together, okay?
1362440	1364200	And so this is, of course, is a time-lapse.
1364200	1367520	And what you can see, this is one frame taken from that movie.
1367520	1371480	What you can see is that long before the genes come on
1371480	1373960	to regionalize the face into the eye, the mouth,
1373960	1375040	and everything else,
1375040	1380040	all of the bioelectrical properties set up a pre-pattern,
1380320	1383040	a scaffold that tell you where everything is going to be.
1383040	1385160	So here's where the animal's right eye is going to be.
1385160	1386840	The left eye will come in shortly.
1386840	1390440	Here is the mouth, here are some placodes.
1390440	1391760	This bioelectrical pattern
1391760	1395920	is a native instructive pattern for gene expression
1395920	1396800	and for anatomy.
1396800	1398600	And the reason we know it's instructive
1398600	1401080	is because if you go in, let's say with optogenetics
1401080	1404600	or with other tools and change this electrical pattern,
1404600	1406800	not move any cells, but just change the pattern,
1406800	1409400	then you can get, for example, those Picasso tadpoles.
1409400	1411960	You can move organs around at will.
1411960	1414000	And I'm going to show you that in a minute.
1414000	1418480	So this is a normal pattern that is necessary
1418480	1421280	for correct craniofacial development.
1421280	1422640	Here's a pathological pattern.
1422640	1425640	So this embryo was injected with a human oncogene.
1425640	1429120	And so something like a KRAS mutation
1429120	1430120	or something like that.
1430120	1432360	And here it's going to form a tumor, right?
1432360	1434280	And the tumor is going to start to spread.
1434280	1435560	But before that happens,
1435560	1437840	before it becomes histologically apparent,
1437840	1439760	you can already see with this voltage dye,
1439760	1442080	here are the cells that have depolarized
1442080	1444800	and shut off the electrical connections to their neighbors
1444800	1447680	in a way that's going to basically revert them back
1447680	1449960	to their unicellular ancient lifestyle.
1449960	1452520	Once you're electrically disconnected from this grid,
1452520	1455320	the rest of the animal becomes just external environment,
1455320	1457040	that computational boundary,
1457040	1458400	whereas before it was large,
1458400	1462520	it was a group working on a liver or a kidney
1462520	1463480	or something like that.
1463480	1465800	It now shrinks to the level of a single cell
1465800	1468320	and all your goals become single cell goals,
1468320	1470760	proliferate, migrate to where life is good and so on.
1470760	1473440	And this ends up being metastasis
1473440	1476120	and conversion of metastasis.
1476120	1478240	So this is a pathological pattern.
1478240	1480880	So what we then developed was a set of tools
1480880	1484200	that were designed to allow us
1484200	1487760	to manipulate these bioelectrical gradients in vivo.
1487760	1489480	So if we thought they were functional,
1489480	1491320	we ought to be able to control them
1491320	1493920	to get the collective to do something different.
1493920	1495520	And so this is important to say
1495520	1498600	that we do not do any external field application.
1498600	1501440	We don't have any electromagnetic components here.
1501440	1503680	There are no electrodes, there are no waves,
1503680	1504800	there's no magnetism.
1504800	1507680	It's all molecular physiology
1507680	1509960	and the way it works is you can,
1509960	1511840	you have two things you can control in any tissue.
1511840	1514560	You can control which cells electrically
1514560	1515880	coupled to which other cells.
1515880	1517400	And so we target these gap junctions,
1517400	1519720	we can mutate them, we can open them, close them.
1519720	1522120	Or, and this is basically synaptic,
1522120	1524240	the controlling synaptic plasticity,
1524240	1527920	or we can control the various ion channels opening,
1527920	1529400	again, opening and closing them
1529400	1532280	to actually set the voltage of the individual cells.
1532280	1533320	And this would be the equivalent
1533320	1534840	of some sort of intrinsic plasticity
1534840	1536400	if this was neuroscience.
1536400	1540520	And again, we can use dominant mutations of channels,
1540520	1544360	we can use drugs, we can use optogenetics, light and so on.
1544360	1546280	And so when you do this,
1546280	1548360	something very interesting happens now.
1548360	1551360	When I first, this was, you know, back,
1551360	1554360	while around the year 2000,
1555520	1556760	I was first setting up these tools
1556760	1561760	and we wanted to control these bioelectric states.
1561880	1563320	It was thought that resting potential
1563320	1564720	is a housekeeping parameter.
1564720	1566320	And basically the standard assumption
1566320	1569680	was that if we perturbed the cells would die
1569680	1571920	and you would get uninterpretable toxicity,
1571920	1573240	that was the thought.
1573240	1574160	So I'm gonna show you that,
1574160	1575720	in fact, that's not at all what happens
1575720	1579800	because these bioelectrical states are not just readouts
1579800	1581080	and they're not just,
1582800	1584920	just yet more molecular machinery,
1584920	1587880	but they're actually the information bearing medium
1587880	1590760	for these large scale modifications.
1590760	1593720	So one thing you can do is you can take some cells
1593720	1595520	in the frog that are going to become gut.
1595520	1597120	So they're endodermal cells
1597120	1600600	and you can inject one of several types of ion channels
1600600	1602920	that will set up or in this region
1602920	1604480	that's going to be part of the gut,
1604480	1607600	will set up a voltage pattern, a distribution of voltage
1607600	1609720	that's very similar to what happens
1609720	1611320	when the native eyes come in.
1611320	1612160	And sure enough,
1612160	1614400	if you recapitulate that pattern somewhere else,
1614400	1615920	the cells are using that pattern
1615920	1618360	to decide what they're going to build
1618360	1620040	and that pattern tells them to build an eye.
1620040	1620880	And here they go,
1620880	1623320	they will build an eye out of endodermal cells.
1623320	1625600	Now in the textbook,
1625600	1628640	we'll say that only anterior ectoderm is competent
1628640	1630080	to become eye up here.
1630080	1630920	And that's true,
1630920	1633560	if you use canonical inducers like PAC-6,
1633560	1637040	the master regulator transcription factor,
1637040	1638720	but if you go upstream of that
1638720	1641240	and actually re-specify the bioelectric pattern,
1641240	1643560	then you can induce these eyes anywhere on the tail
1643560	1645160	and the gut anywhere you want.
1645160	1648160	And if you make these tails, these eyes rather,
1648160	1652160	they can have all of the same components
1652160	1653000	that normalize have.
1653000	1655760	So they'll have lens and retina and optic nerve and so on.
1655760	1657520	And here's an interesting thing.
1657520	1659760	If you label the cells
1659760	1661920	that you've directly injected with the scion channel,
1661920	1664280	let's say we'll label them with beta galactosidase,
1664280	1665480	so they're blue.
1665480	1667200	And this is a cross-section through a lens
1667200	1668880	sitting out in the flank somewhere.
1668880	1672120	What you'll see is that there are two inductions here.
1672120	1674440	The first induction is by us
1674440	1679440	putting in imposing a particular bioelectrical state
1679880	1682200	that causes these cells to decide to become a lens.
1682200	1683400	That's the first induction.
1683400	1685840	The second induction is that these cells
1685840	1687760	with their aberrant voltage potential
1687760	1689800	actually recruit their neighbors.
1689800	1691600	The brown cells here, which are not labeled,
1691600	1693920	which were never directly modified by us,
1693920	1695520	recruit them into this project
1695520	1698320	of building this larger scale structure,
1698320	1700000	this nice round lens.
1700000	1702120	So it's a non-cell autonomous effect.
1702120	1703640	And when we see this again and again,
1703640	1707520	that there's this ability of these bioelectrical signals
1707520	1711040	to not just to specify cell fate,
1711040	1713720	but to actually specify organ type and position
1713720	1714760	and things like that.
1714760	1716840	So we can make eyes, we can make ectopic hearts.
1716840	1718240	Here's a secondary heart.
1718240	1721240	We can make limbs and brains and some other things
1721240	1723560	and then many things that we can't yet make.
1723560	1726680	Now, let's look at another example.
1726680	1728160	Here's a planarian.
1728160	1730000	And one of the most interesting things
1730000	1732000	is that if you chop off the head and the tail,
1732000	1734040	this middle fragment knows exactly
1734040	1735400	how many heads it's supposed to have.
1735400	1736720	It puts one head here.
1736720	1738080	It puts a tail here.
1738080	1741360	And the way it does that is because as soon as you amputate,
1741360	1743560	there's this voltage gradient that's set up
1743560	1746440	where the red, the depolarized region tells the worm
1746440	1748360	how many heads it's supposed to have.
1748360	1751080	So what we can do is we can go in and target this region
1751080	1754320	using drugs, using basically ion channel modifying drugs
1754320	1756400	to depolarize this region.
1756400	1758480	And when you do that, you get a two-headed animal.
1758480	1760560	These cells are perfectly happy to make a head.
1760560	1762960	The information of how many heads you're supposed to have
1762960	1764320	comes from this electrical gradient.
1764360	1766880	If you change the gradient, they'll happily make two heads.
1766880	1768520	You can make two-headed animals.
1768520	1770520	You can make no-headed animals.
1770520	1772400	All kinds of interesting behavioral experiments
1772400	1775720	to be done that we can discuss if there's time.
1775720	1781080	But what's important here is that there are much like...
1781080	1783120	There's no genomic editing here.
1783120	1786960	So this is purely physiological.
1786960	1789200	And not only can I ask this animal
1789200	1792640	to make a second head of the correct type,
1792640	1795200	I can actually ask it to make heads belonging
1795200	1796600	to other species.
1796600	1799480	So here's we started off with a triangular-headed worm
1799480	1802040	like this, amputate the head per-turb
1802040	1804000	for about 48 hours, the ability of cells
1804000	1805680	to talk to each other electrically.
1805680	1807880	And what happens is the electric circuit is unable
1807880	1810240	to settle to the correct attractor.
1810240	1812320	And when they do settle stochastically,
1812320	1814600	sometimes they settle to the correct shape,
1814600	1817560	but sometimes they make round heads or flat heads.
1817560	1821840	And in doing so, they recapitulate the state
1821840	1824120	of flat-headed species like this Pifolina
1824120	1827160	or round-headed species like this S-Mediterranean.
1827160	1828600	It's not just the shape of the head,
1828600	1831640	it's also the shape of the brain
1831640	1833520	and the distribution of stem cells
1833520	1836480	that is exactly like these other species.
1836480	1840120	Again, no genomic editing here, perfectly wild-type genome.
1840120	1843240	And these animals, once the electric circuit settles,
1843240	1845040	there's a good chance that it'll settle
1845040	1847120	into an inappropriate attractor
1847120	1850040	that's actually associated with a completely different head
1850040	1853520	shape that in fact other species are using natively.
1853520	1856560	Now, you can also knock the system into attractors
1856560	1859360	that are not being used to my knowledge by any system.
1859360	1864360	And you can really get far from the normal planarian shape.
1864880	1867960	You can make animals that are spiky like this.
1867960	1870680	You can make animals that are cylindrical like this
1870680	1872680	or a combination of a flat animal
1872680	1875760	with a tube growing out into the third dimension.
1875760	1877800	Now, I'm gonna show you in a minute
1877840	1880360	that what this is all about
1880360	1882960	is predictive control over large-scale anatomy.
1882960	1887960	This is not about making weird aberrant teratologies and so on.
1888400	1891400	The idea is that we can show how much of this
1891400	1893680	is actually under bioelectrical control
1893680	1895800	and then use computational techniques
1895800	1900360	to gain good predictive control over it.
1900360	1904920	And so this is a good time to think about the role
1904920	1909560	of the genome in the anatomy of this whole process.
1909560	1912440	The typical metaphor that we hear is that
1913320	1915720	the DNA or the genome is the software
1915720	1918640	and that the cell is the hardware that interprets this.
1918640	1922080	And that's not a bad analogy at the single cell level
1922080	1924720	when you're thinking about phenotypes of proteins
1924720	1927800	and pathways, but at the level of anatomy,
1927800	1930720	I would suggest a different metaphor.
1930720	1932360	And the different metaphor that works better
1933120	1936040	to understand anatomical control is this.
1936040	1940960	Actually, what the genome does is specify all of the hardware
1940960	1942320	that the cell gets to have.
1942320	1945120	So all of the specific ion channels that are here
1945120	1948160	are determined by the gene expression.
1948160	1951760	But we know from basic neuroscience
1951760	1953920	and also from computer technology
1953920	1956160	that if you make a very simple circuit,
1956160	1958040	this is a flip-flop circuit right here,
1958040	1959880	if you nail down the hardware,
1959880	1961280	what you can have is a circuit
1961280	1965760	that can store multiple different pieces of information
1965760	1967880	depending on the current flow through the system
1967880	1970640	and store it stably, which is a memory,
1970640	1972560	a flip-flop is a basic kind of memory.
1972560	1975360	And you don't need to move or change any of the hardware
1975360	1978400	in order to store a zero or a one
1978400	1981360	in this very simple electrical circuit.
1981360	1982840	So in fact, with our modeling,
1982840	1985480	you can see that the same thing is true
1985480	1989120	if you set up a field of cells with a particular
1989120	1991120	where every single cell is expressing
1991120	1993360	exactly the same set of ion channels,
1993360	1995800	what you actually make is an excitable tissue
1995800	1998720	where very rich patterning can take place.
1998720	2001440	It's a little bit like touring patterns, right?
2001440	2003640	There's self-spontaneous symmetry breaking
2003640	2005040	and self-organization,
2005040	2008400	but all of this happens with a completely constant proteome.
2008400	2010600	You don't need to change these ion channels
2010600	2011920	because they can open and close.
2011920	2013400	And so now all of the dynamics
2013400	2015080	are at the electrical circuit level,
2015080	2018040	not with the proteins underneath.
2018040	2020640	And so the prediction of this way of thinking about it
2020640	2023320	is this, you should be able to edit the software,
2023320	2026240	meaning change the information stored in the system
2026240	2028560	while keeping the hardware constant.
2028560	2030520	And in particular, just to remind you,
2030520	2034480	the piece of information that we want to change
2034480	2035680	is the set point.
2035680	2037920	We want to change the set point towards
2037920	2042040	which cells are working in this error minimization scheme.
2042040	2044120	So let's think about how to do that.
2044120	2045720	So here's our normal planarian.
2045720	2047320	We've cut off the head and the tail.
2047320	2048440	We got the middle fragment.
2048440	2049880	We perturbed the electric circuit
2049880	2052120	according to this model that we've developed.
2052120	2054000	And here's your two-headed animal.
2054000	2055960	Now we ask a simple question.
2055960	2057160	Here's our two-headed animal.
2057160	2062200	We give it a couple of weeks to get everything settled down,
2062200	2064200	cut off the primary head,
2064200	2066880	cut off this crazy ectopic secondary head.
2066880	2069640	Some people think, oh, you somehow epigenetically reprogram
2069640	2070680	this posterior tissue.
2070680	2072760	Fine, we'll cut it off, we'll throw it away.
2072760	2076400	All that remains is a normal middle fragment here
2076400	2078520	that didn't have any head tissue in it.
2078520	2079720	We do this in plain water,
2079720	2081760	no more manipulations of any kind.
2081760	2082960	The genome is wild type.
2082960	2086080	We haven't edited the genomic sequence at all.
2086080	2090080	So surely the prediction would be that you should have,
2090080	2091640	but you should get back to a single-headed worm.
2091640	2093080	Once you cut off this thing,
2093080	2095640	you should be back to a single-headed worm.
2095640	2098040	Now the interesting thing is that if you actually model
2098040	2101040	the state space of the electric circuit that's involved here,
2101040	2103960	what you find is that there are multiple stable points.
2104000	2106600	One is here, a very stable point
2106600	2109120	around the single-headed shape like this,
2109120	2110680	but there's another stable point
2110680	2113120	around the double-headed shape.
2113120	2115040	And so that suggests an interesting idea
2115040	2117920	that is it possible that when you amputate this thing,
2117920	2120320	the bioelectrical circuit will still remember
2120320	2122200	that it needs to make two heads.
2122200	2125040	And sure enough, that's exactly what happens.
2125040	2127160	When you amputate these in perpetuity,
2127160	2128760	as far as we can tell forever,
2128760	2131320	two-headed animals will continue to give rise
2131320	2132600	to two-headed animals,
2132600	2135440	even despite their wild-type genome in plain water,
2135440	2136720	no more manipulation.
2136720	2138560	And we can, in fact, if we want to,
2138560	2141760	we can set the bioelectric circuit back to normal
2141760	2144160	and it goes back to being a single-headed animal.
2144160	2149160	So a normal planarian body, as you're going to see,
2150440	2152960	is able to store a couple of different,
2152960	2154200	at least probably more,
2154200	2156760	but we've nailed down to ideas
2156760	2159680	of what a correct planarian is supposed to look like.
2159680	2162960	And this is how you can see this.
2162960	2165240	So here's a single-headed planarian.
2165240	2167120	And if we look at the molecular markers,
2167120	2170200	the anterior marker is here in the head, not in the tail.
2170200	2171120	And if you amputate,
2171120	2174280	you get a perfectly normal single-headed animal, fine.
2174280	2176320	Here's another anatomically normal animal.
2176320	2178040	Again, molecular markers are all normal,
2178040	2181000	anterior in the head, no anterior back here,
2181000	2182880	that no anterior marker back here.
2182880	2184800	But if you amputate this one,
2184800	2186200	suddenly you get a two-headed animal.
2186200	2187640	Why would you get a two-headed animal?
2187640	2190480	Because in the meantime, what we've done
2190480	2194800	is we've bioelectrically changed the stable pattern
2194800	2197120	to say, no, now you need to have two heads.
2197120	2199880	Now, here's the critical part of this.
2199880	2201760	This electrical map here
2201760	2204600	is not a map of this two-headed animal.
2204600	2208120	This electrical map is a map of this one-headed animal,
2208120	2211720	meaning that the bioelectricity distribution
2211720	2214600	is not simply a map of whatever the anatomy is doing.
2214600	2217480	The same single-headed anatomy
2217480	2220080	can store at least one of two different
2220080	2222840	stable representations of what it's going to do
2222840	2224720	if it gets injured in the future.
2224720	2226120	If you're interested in neuroscience
2226120	2229400	and how counterfactuals are remembered in the brain,
2229400	2232600	this, I think, is sort of the evolutionary precursor
2232600	2236360	to being able to remember things that are not happening now,
2236360	2237840	either things that happened before
2237840	2239000	or might happen in the future.
2239000	2240440	It's a counterfactual memory.
2240440	2244160	It's the ability to store a representation of a worm
2244160	2246480	towards which the fragment is going to build
2246480	2247600	if it gets injured.
2247600	2249040	So it sits perfectly comfortably
2249040	2252200	as a single-headed animal with this pattern until you cut.
2252200	2256280	And at that point, that memory is no longer latent
2256280	2257560	and it's actually becomes functional.
2257560	2262120	And that's how we get this propagation
2262120	2263440	of these two-headed worms.
2263440	2268520	So we are building some very sort of quantitative,
2268520	2271040	molecular, biophysical models
2271040	2273800	to really understand the state space of the circuit,
2273800	2277480	to understand how the circuit minimizes free energy
2277480	2279360	and eventually lands in one of these attractors,
2279360	2280280	hopefully the right one,
2280280	2282120	but not necessarily the right one,
2282120	2285400	and tying it into exactly the same formalism
2285400	2289400	for how people in machine learning think about networks,
2289400	2292120	electrical networks that can store patterns
2292120	2295400	and can actually repair those patterns
2295400	2297040	when pieces of the information are missing.
2297040	2301320	This is all very well-trodden ground in machine learning.
2301320	2303840	And we think that some of these same strategies
2303840	2307600	that we use now were discovered by evolution long ago.
2307600	2312600	And beyond worms, this is the beginnings of our roadmap
2316520	2319240	for regenerative medicine.
2319240	2321760	Because what we found is that, for example,
2321760	2325200	if you have a frog and the frogs do not regenerate their legs
2325200	2327480	the way that salamanders do, you amputate the leg.
2327480	2330320	45 days later, there's basically nothing.
2330320	2333080	There's no blastema and there's no regenerate.
2333080	2334880	What we can do is we can apply a cocktail
2334880	2339800	of ion channel drugs that serve as a stimulus
2339800	2342760	to kickstart a very complex cascade.
2342760	2346640	So what you see here is immediately the MSX-1
2346640	2348920	blastema marker becomes turned on.
2348920	2351760	The leg starts growing.
2351760	2355360	Already you have the toes and here's a toenail
2355360	2357800	and eventually you get a very respectable leg here
2357800	2360280	and it's touch sensitive and motile.
2360280	2362480	Okay, so the animal can use it.
2362480	2364080	There's a couple of interesting things about this.
2364080	2367080	One, is that much like when we created an eye
2367080	2370640	or induced a second head on the planarian,
2370640	2374040	inducing this leg, we don't provide all the information
2374040	2376200	to micromanage the process, right?
2376200	2378640	We have no idea how to build a planarian head from scratch
2378640	2380480	or how to make an eye or how to make a leg.
2380480	2383840	What we have found is a trigger for a subroutine
2383840	2387600	that this tissue already knows
2387600	2390960	how to do and the decision for what it's going to do,
2390960	2393960	scar or produce various types of organs can be,
2393960	2396320	is part of an electric circuit that we can guide.
2396320	2398080	We can manage.
2398080	2399600	So that's the first interesting thing.
2399600	2403280	The second thing is that in keeping with this idea
2403280	2406160	from the beginning that one of the hallmarks
2406160	2408000	of the collective intelligence of these cells
2408000	2412240	and responding to novel situations is that they can get
2412240	2417000	to the final outcome through novel paths.
2417000	2419880	And if you actually look at this intermediate stage
2419880	2423320	of this leg, this is nothing like what frog legs look like
2423320	2425040	when they're developing in the first place.
2425040	2428240	So it eventually gets to a very good frog leg shape here,
2428240	2430440	basically indistinguishable from the control,
2430440	2432640	but the intermediate path through morpho space,
2432640	2434280	the ability of the system to navigate
2434280	2436880	that anatomical morpho space is amazing
2436880	2439320	because it does not follow the same path
2439320	2442000	that frog limbs normally follow where they make a paddle
2442000	2443680	and then they, you know, there's apoptosis
2443680	2446760	that kills off the space between the digits and so on.
2446800	2447640	It's not what they do.
2447640	2450200	They grow, it's almost like a plant meristem
2450200	2452120	where you get the central stalk with this nail
2452120	2454240	and then off to the side, you get these toes
2454240	2456400	and eventually the whole thing remodels into a leg.
2456400	2459640	So the remarkable ability to get its job done
2459640	2461720	in a different way.
2461720	2466720	So now we, this is not just things that apply
2466760	2470280	to frog and worm, we've done some work with David Kaplan
2470280	2474520	and Lauren Black and others on human mesenchymal stem cells
2474520	2475960	and cardiomyocytes.
2475960	2478280	And you can control the kinds of things
2478280	2480480	that you can see in vitro differentiation,
2480480	2482080	proliferation, wound healing,
2482080	2484760	but I think that's not what the bioelectricity is for.
2484760	2486480	What the bioelectricity is really for
2486480	2488240	in terms of why evolution uses it
2488240	2490080	and why we should be interested in
2490080	2494600	is because it allows us to exploit the modular nature
2494600	2496400	of the anatomical decision-making
2496400	2499200	because we can control very large scale outcomes
2499200	2502440	not micromanage the details.
2502440	2505080	And here I have to do a disclosure.
2505120	2509160	So David Kaplan and I are both co-founders
2509160	2511000	of this company called Morphosuticals Inc.
2511000	2513480	where we're trying to take the things that we learned
2513480	2517280	about frog leg regeneration and move them towards mammals.
2517280	2519320	So our goal is where we're now in rodents
2519320	2521960	trying for limb regeneration using the same strategies
2521960	2524440	and using these wearable bioreactors.
2524440	2527520	And the idea is to again, kickstart regeneration,
2527520	2530600	not micromanage it, not try to babysit all of the
2530600	2533000	different cell types and growth factors
2533000	2534280	and everything else has to go in.
2535040	2537320	But kickstart a trigger very early on
2537320	2540400	and convince the cells with an aqueous protective environment
2540400	2544240	that it's basically that regeneration can proceed
2544240	2546280	in the way that it would in a salamander
2546280	2551280	or in an embryonic mammal during this adult phase.
2552400	2556760	So that's kind of where one of the research programs is going.
2557560	2562120	I should point out this that it is already known
2562120	2565000	how it is that voltage change impacts
2565000	2567040	the transcriptional machinery.
2567040	2570600	People often sort of say that it would be great
2570600	2573400	if we understood how voltage controls gene expression.
2573400	2577440	We basically do, we already know about six ways
2577440	2580520	that voltage change transduces down
2580520	2583600	into second messenger pathways and controls gene expression.
2584760	2587400	And this has typical mechanisms like calcium,
2587400	2590160	which neuroscience is very familiar with,
2590160	2593360	other things like voltage sensitive phosphatases,
2593360	2594880	neurotransmitter transporters.
2594880	2598400	We already know how this works at a single cell level.
2598400	2602040	This transduction machinery has been dissected.
2602040	2604440	In fact, also some of the downstream targets
2604440	2605480	have been identified.
2605480	2607880	So the genes that are controlled by this,
2607880	2612480	all of your favorite BMPs, sonic hedgehogs, FGFs,
2612480	2614200	all of these kinds of things are in fact,
2614200	2615840	the redistribution of morphogens
2615840	2617920	and the examples that I showed you.
2617920	2621800	All of this is known both from specific candidates
2621800	2624720	and through unbiased, let's say RNA-seq
2624720	2627760	and the microarray types of things.
2627760	2630320	We know this, but what's interesting is that
2630320	2634000	these answers as to how it works on a single cell level
2634000	2639000	have been fairly unhelpful in understanding
2639120	2641680	the large scale picture that we're really interested in.
2641680	2643080	And it's very much analogous
2643080	2645000	to this multi-scale problem in neuroscience.
2645000	2647600	You can track the pathway and we do.
2647600	2649080	And in every paper, you have to sort of go
2649080	2650960	from the channel to the transduction machinery,
2650960	2653120	which genes are downstream, so you can do all this.
2653120	2656560	But that actually leaves open some much deeper questions
2656560	2658280	about how the collective makes decisions.
2658280	2662520	And so for that reason, we've made the simulator,
2662520	2664960	and this was created by our center member
2664960	2666760	and collaborator, Alexis Pytak.
2666760	2669920	And what allows us to do is to build models
2669920	2673600	of both molecular networks like GRNs
2673640	2678240	together with the various biophysics steps that happen.
2678240	2681800	And you can simulate every cell having these various circuits.
2681800	2684440	And then you can try to build a full stack model
2684440	2687720	that integrates from the molecular steps
2687720	2689480	to the tissue level physiology,
2689480	2691160	like every cell has various channels.
2691160	2692480	What is the electrical pattern
2692480	2694000	and they're gonna be in this tissue?
2694000	2696840	What does that look like on an axial polarity level?
2696840	2698640	You know, where's the head, where's the tail?
2698640	2701520	And then can we extract from this
2701520	2703800	the actual rules of the decision-making?
2703800	2706440	Can we turn this into a kind of algorithmic description
2706440	2708800	that looks like this that makes it much easier
2708800	2710440	for us to control the process?
2710440	2711720	Because now this is almost to like
2711720	2713960	a high level programming language where we can see,
2713960	2715480	okay, here are the measurables
2715480	2718120	and here are the decision points that the circuit is using
2718120	2721400	to control large scale patterning modules
2721400	2722600	like make a head, make an eye.
2722600	2727600	And so what we're doing is literally integrating
2727840	2730080	every part of this so that you can build it up
2730080	2732600	and then exert all your manipulations at this level.
2732600	2735760	So you could have your simulator and ask questions like,
2735760	2738680	why does the head-tail gradient rescale
2738680	2740440	when you cut the planarian into four pieces?
2740440	2741520	You know, how does that work?
2741520	2745040	And you can't see that by drilling down into single cells.
2745040	2748640	You have to come back out with that information
2748640	2753000	and build these collective kinds of models.
2753000	2754560	And the other nice thing about these models
2754560	2756520	is that they are the perfect fodder
2756520	2759040	for machine learning approaches
2759040	2762360	to do two things, to infer better models from data.
2762360	2765480	Okay, and we've done some of that.
2765480	2769400	And also then to interrogate those models for interventions.
2769400	2773200	And so here's some software that anyone can play with
2773200	2776240	if you want to download and kind of simulate all this.
2776240	2778840	And we've shown that you can actually use machine learning
2778840	2781120	to find models that are really good
2781120	2783560	at explaining functional data sets.
2783560	2785640	In other words, you know, you did something to the system
2785640	2787760	and then something else happened.
2787760	2789480	What is a model explains that?
2789480	2792480	And then find these kind of needle in a haystack interventions
2792480	2795280	that are ways in which you could perturb it
2795280	2796560	to get it to do what you want.
2796560	2799760	Okay, so that I think is the kind of the future
2799760	2801840	of using this for regenerative medicine.
2801840	2805560	So let's talk specifically about a couple of applications
2805560	2807280	in the last few minutes.
2808680	2811920	The first thing is again, the cancer issue.
2811920	2815880	So I've shown you that you can track the
2817800	2822400	shrinking of these kinds of computational boundaries
2822400	2825840	from data for the organ or whole body scale to single cells.
2825840	2829400	And you can use this as an obvious application here
2829400	2832800	as a kind of diagnostic modality, right?
2832800	2834640	It's screening for cancer and so on.
2834640	2838320	But functionally, what's really important is that first of all,
2838320	2843320	you can induce basically a conversion of normal melanocytes.
2844080	2846200	So here they are, these little black dots
2846200	2848520	are pigment cells, they're melanocytes.
2848520	2851320	If you depolarize a very specific cell population
2851320	2853360	in the animal, not the melanocytes themselves,
2853360	2854960	but a different cell population,
2854960	2857360	we call them instructor cells for an obvious reason.
2857360	2859880	They, those cells tell the melanocytes what to do,
2859880	2864080	in particular to stay nice cooperative melanocytes
2864080	2867320	under control, if you block their ability to signal,
2867320	2869880	what happens is basically metastatic melanoma.
2869880	2873000	These normal melanocytes convert to these crazy
2873960	2877760	really, really kind of a long stringy things
2877760	2879640	that start to crawl away.
2879640	2882160	They dig into the brain, they dig into the neural tube,
2882160	2884920	they start to invade.
2884920	2886920	Here they are all through the blood vessels.
2886920	2890560	This is basically exactly like a melanoma type of behavior.
2890560	2892600	And you can see here, these blue cells,
2892600	2894760	these are the ones that we actually depolarized.
2894760	2896160	They are the ones that are now failing
2896160	2898800	to keep the normal melanocytes behaving correctly.
2898800	2900440	And the melanocytes are just at this point,
2900440	2902600	they're going on their own.
2902600	2905520	So it's a voltage change in the environment.
2905520	2907640	There's nothing genetically wrong with these animals.
2907640	2908480	There are no oncogenes.
2908480	2913240	There were no carcinogens, nothing like that.
2914120	2917760	But this voltage change is a physiological switch
2917760	2921240	away from the cooperation of cells toward embryogenesis
2921240	2924520	and towards single cell behavior.
2924520	2926960	Now, what's cool is that you can override this.
2926960	2929680	So if we inject an oncogene and they make these tumors,
2929680	2932280	of course they're labeled with the red fluorescent protein,
2932280	2934320	what you can do is co-inject the channel
2934320	2935720	and you can force these cells
2935720	2937640	to stay electrically coupled to their neighbors,
2937640	2939960	despite what the oncogene is trying to get them to do.
2939960	2943760	And here, while that dominant negative KRAS P53,
2943760	2946800	whatever, while they're blazingly expressed,
2946800	2948320	there's no tumor, it's the same animal.
2948320	2950720	There's no tumor because these cells
2950720	2952920	are coupled to this electrical network
2952920	2957840	that forces them towards a proper tissue fate.
2957840	2961840	So that's where our sort of cancer applications are going,
2962800	2965080	and we've done this with light, with optogenetics and so on.
2965080	2969800	And now we're in human cells to try to use this
2969800	2973760	to target carcinogenic behavior in human cells.
2973760	2976240	The other thing that is important is, again,
2976240	2978280	to think about the level of control
2978280	2979480	that's possible with this.
2980600	2982720	Here is a normal tadpole brain.
2982720	2985200	So you see forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain.
2985200	2988960	And what you can do is if you, for example,
2988960	2991080	introduce a mutated notch protein.
2991080	2993400	So notch is a very important neurogenesis gene.
2993400	2996120	You can mutate it and introduce a dominant mutation.
2996120	2998320	You can see forebrain is basically gone,
2998320	3000400	midbrain and hindbrain and just a bubble.
3000400	3003320	These animals have no behavior to speak of.
3003320	3006360	They, you know, they lay there, they do nothing.
3006360	3008520	You can do the same thing with alcohol, nicotine,
3008520	3010440	various teratogen exposures.
3010440	3012840	What you can do is build a computational model.
3012840	3015960	And again, this is the work of Alexis Paytak,
3015960	3018560	Pay, who's a staff scientist in my group
3018560	3021000	and a few collaborators.
3021000	3023640	What you can do is you can build a computational model
3023640	3025040	that asks a simple question.
3025040	3028080	What determines the shape and size of the brain?
3028080	3030040	And there's a particular bioelectrical pattern
3030040	3031840	that's required for the brain.
3031840	3034720	And then on these backgrounds of teratogens
3034720	3038040	or even notch mutation, you can ask the model a question.
3038040	3041040	You can say, if this pattern is disturbed,
3041040	3044040	such as it is here, what channels would I have to open
3044040	3047440	or close to get back to the correct pattern?
3047440	3049480	And the model told us and it said,
3049480	3051440	there's a particular channel HCN2,
3051440	3053640	which can help us sharpen these boundaries,
3053640	3056640	even though there are massive defects in the notch signaling
3056640	3059480	and, you know, with these various other pathways,
3059480	3062800	you can still reinforce these boundaries by opening HCN2.
3062800	3065280	And sure enough, if you do it with drugs,
3065280	3068440	or if you do, or if you just mis-express HCN2,
3068440	3071640	you can get back to a normal brain shape,
3071640	3074400	a normal brain gene expression, and in fact, normal IQ.
3074400	3075920	These animals get their behaviors back
3075920	3077920	and their learning rates back.
3077920	3079400	So here's what this is.
3079400	3082800	This is using a very specific computational model
3082800	3087360	to rationally manipulate the electrical signaling
3087360	3091480	to get back to a very complex organ morphogenesis.
3091480	3095360	And so the whole sort of roadmap
3095360	3096720	looks a little bit like this.
3096720	3100640	If we already have expression data, profiling data,
3100640	3103600	on which tissues in the body express which channels,
3103600	3104840	so that's already known.
3104840	3107080	This needs a lot more work,
3107080	3109400	which is if you knew what the voltage pattern
3109400	3111360	was supposed to be in various healthy tissues
3111360	3112600	under various conditions,
3112600	3115280	so basically physiomic profiling is needed.
3115280	3120280	Then we have this computational simulation engine,
3120920	3124520	which is able to say if you want to go
3124520	3127320	from the incorrect pattern to the correct pattern,
3127320	3129800	which of these channels would you have to open and close?
3129800	3131560	Okay, and that tells you immediately
3131560	3136120	what cocktail of ion channel drugs you would need to use.
3136120	3140000	And so we've developed this pipeline.
3140000	3142720	You can, again, you can play with it here
3142720	3145600	and choose your tissue and so on.
3145600	3149000	And the idea is that something like 20% of all drugs
3149000	3150440	are ion channel drugs.
3150440	3153720	And these things form an incredibly convenient toolkit
3153720	3155680	of what we call them electroseuticals,
3155680	3159240	because if you have the right computational model,
3159240	3160840	you can repurpose these,
3160840	3164760	which and the human safety data is done on these things.
3164800	3167640	People already take them for all kinds of uses
3167640	3169600	and they have a massive applicability
3169600	3172440	in tweaking the bioelectrical signals.
3172440	3175080	Now, another nice thing about this kind of approach
3175080	3178760	is that once the bioelectric circuit has made its decision,
3178760	3181320	the downstream steps that are in second messengers,
3181320	3183240	then gene expression, everything else,
3183240	3184560	you can be as long as you want.
3184560	3186840	So for example, in the case of the frog,
3186840	3190920	a one day 24 hour application of a particular cocktail
3190920	3194560	gives you 13 months of leg growth, right?
3194560	3199160	And you don't have to micromanage that whole process.
3199160	3202000	It's just figuring out what electrical state
3202000	3205440	is gonna shift the tissue towards a particular goal state
3205440	3207640	that all of the cells are going to work towards.
3207640	3211360	So I'm just gonna close here and summarize as follows.
3211360	3213200	There's this really important layer
3213200	3215320	of physiological decision-making
3215320	3217880	that sits between the genotype and the anatomy.
3217880	3220840	And it's becoming a really tractable target for biomedicine
3220840	3222800	and also synthetic bioengineering,
3222800	3226880	because we can now see how the electrical dynamics
3226880	3229680	that are operating in that tissue encode
3229680	3232040	particular anatomical layouts
3232040	3234640	towards which the cells continue to build.
3234640	3237120	And evolution apparently discovered very early on
3237120	3240440	that this electrical signaling is a really convenient medium
3240440	3242560	for computation and global decision-making.
3242560	3245960	It's not an accident that all nervous systems use it
3245960	3248760	and all of our computer technology uses it.
3249600	3253960	Ion channels, especially the voltage-gated ion channels
3253960	3256400	are basically voltage-gated current conductances.
3256400	3257840	They're transistors, right?
3257840	3260600	And that's a very powerful architecture
3260600	3262600	that evolution found long before we did
3262600	3265840	for forming feedback loops, memory circuits, and so on.
3265840	3268960	And we think that cracking this bioelectric code
3268960	3270920	can help reveal how cell networks
3270920	3273200	make decisions in large-scale anatomy,
3273200	3275920	not just how individual cells decide
3275920	3277320	what type of cell they're going to be,
3277320	3281040	but actually the real question of growth and form,
3281040	3284200	where do these complex patterns reside?
3284200	3286120	And we can now rewrite some of these patterns,
3286120	3290360	such as, for example, in the planarian or in the frog.
3290360	3293360	And new machine learning tools are coming online
3293360	3295280	to help us design strategies
3295280	3298440	for all kinds of applications.
3298440	3301680	So I would like to thank the people in my group
3301680	3302760	who did the work.
3302760	3305280	These are all the postdocs and students.
3306240	3309880	And others who did the work that I showed you today.
3309880	3312560	Here are some of our collaborators
3312560	3313840	who are working with us.
3313840	3315640	Of course, the model systems that we work with,
3315640	3317440	all kinds of animals.
3317440	3320960	And our funders, very grateful to them.
3320960	3323360	Again, Disclosure, Morphosuticals Inc.
3323360	3326240	is the company for our frog limb regeneration work.
3326240	3327640	And just in the end,
3327640	3331080	I always like to show a video of these two-headed animals.
3331080	3333440	The first time I reported these data at a meeting,
3333440	3334400	someone stood up and said,
3334440	3336400	that's impossible, those animals can't exist.
3336400	3339120	And so now I make sure that I bring a video.
