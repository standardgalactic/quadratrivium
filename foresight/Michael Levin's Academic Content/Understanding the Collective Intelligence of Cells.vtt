WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
Okay, so it's a great pleasure today for me to introduce Professor Michael Levin.

00:07.400 --> 00:13.360
He's a distinguished professor at Tufts University, as well as the Vannevar Bush professor.

00:13.360 --> 00:19.520
And he's also director of the Allen Discovery Center and the Tufts Center for Regenerative

00:19.520 --> 00:23.080
and Developmental Biology.

00:23.080 --> 00:31.920
And I'm sure everyone here have heard about his work on Xenobots, which I've been told

00:31.920 --> 00:34.320
there'll be some of that at the end of his talks.

00:34.320 --> 00:42.440
So Michael has requested that we refrain from asking deep questions until the end.

00:42.440 --> 00:46.000
So just clarification questions throughout the talk so that we can get to the really

00:46.000 --> 00:47.400
exciting parts.

00:47.400 --> 00:51.200
Okay, so take it away.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.200
Thank you.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.200
Thank you so much.

00:53.200 --> 00:57.960
And thank you for having me and giving me the opportunity to share some ideas with you.

00:57.960 --> 01:03.120
All of the details and if you would like to contact me, which would be great, you can

01:03.120 --> 01:05.800
find me at these two websites.

01:05.800 --> 01:11.560
So what I want to talk about today is our sort of perspective on collective intelligence

01:11.560 --> 01:15.840
and in particular cellular behavior as a kind of collective intelligence.

01:15.840 --> 01:22.760
So I often start by thinking about Alan Turing, who of course needs no introduction, was very

01:22.760 --> 01:29.480
interested in intelligence, in cognition and various embodiments, and in particular in

01:29.480 --> 01:36.240
problem-solving machines, this idea that intelligence can be manifest through plasticity or reprogrammability.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.800
And so we all know that.

01:38.800 --> 01:43.600
Some people may or may not know that he was also interested in morphogenesis, the generation

01:43.600 --> 01:45.760
of biological shape.

01:45.760 --> 01:49.880
And it's often, one might wonder, why would the same person who was interested in intelligence

01:49.880 --> 01:55.640
be interested in the kinds of questions that biologists tend to, developmental biologists

01:55.640 --> 01:57.640
in particular tend to deal with.

01:57.640 --> 02:03.640
And I think he saw a very deep symmetry between these two fields, which is, I think, very

02:03.640 --> 02:08.840
important and still not really appreciated sufficiently.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.400
So this is what we work on.

02:10.400 --> 02:14.000
In particular, the idea of problem-solving living machines.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.200
And one thing that we have to think about as we drill down in the biology and we look

02:19.200 --> 02:25.440
to see what we are all made of is this idea that this traditional distinction between,

02:25.440 --> 02:30.760
we look at things like termite mounds and bee colonies and blard flocks and we say, okay,

02:30.760 --> 02:36.880
that's perhaps a kind of collective intelligence, but we are true sort of centralized intelligences.

02:36.880 --> 02:43.040
And of course, the idea is that actually all intelligence, certainly in biology as well

02:43.040 --> 02:47.640
as collective intelligence, because we are all made of parts and components.

02:47.640 --> 02:51.800
And in fact, the Ambricard Sole calls this kind of thing a liquid brain in the sense

02:51.800 --> 02:56.480
that the components are not fixed with respect to their spatial relationships.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.120
So this is the sort of thing of which we are made.

02:59.120 --> 03:00.440
This is a single cell.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.440
This is called a lacrimaria.

03:01.440 --> 03:06.200
Of course, this is a free-living organism.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.200
It's one cell.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.200
It has no brain.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.720
It has no nervous system.

03:09.720 --> 03:15.000
It is extremely competent in its local sort of environment with its local goals.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
So it's physiological.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
It's anatomical.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.600
It's behavioral goals.

03:18.600 --> 03:23.880
It's very competent without the typical things that we associate with intelligence.

03:23.880 --> 03:30.520
And the really critical part is to realize is that all of us make this amazing journey

03:30.520 --> 03:34.440
from what people call just physics to cognition.

03:34.440 --> 03:41.280
So we were all at one point a quiescent oocyte, so a little pile of chemicals doing something

03:41.280 --> 03:45.480
like this where specific molecules interact with other molecules.

03:45.480 --> 03:49.400
But eventually, through this process of embryonic development, we become something like this

03:49.400 --> 03:51.560
or maybe even something like that.

03:51.560 --> 03:56.440
And so the thing about this process is that it's extremely slow and gradual.

03:56.440 --> 04:01.960
There is no special point at which a magic lightning flash sort of says, okay, now you

04:01.960 --> 04:02.960
are cognitive.

04:02.960 --> 04:03.960
Before that, you were just physics.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.080
In chemistry, now you are a true cognitive individual.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.080
That doesn't happen.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.560
So we need to understand this scale up.

04:09.560 --> 04:14.200
We need to understand what happens from the time that we are this to the time that we

04:14.200 --> 04:15.200
are that.

04:15.200 --> 04:21.420
So the main points today that I would like to talk about is this idea of biology's multi-scale

04:21.420 --> 04:26.520
competency architecture, which is a set of nested problem solvers in different spaces.

04:26.520 --> 04:30.600
And one kind of invariant to all of this is navigation.

04:30.600 --> 04:35.720
I want to spend the most of my time on this example, although there are many other examples,

04:35.720 --> 04:39.680
of anatomical control and specifically this idea of navigating morpho space.

04:39.680 --> 04:46.280
And I will talk a lot about bioelectrical networks as not only the mediator of kind

04:46.280 --> 04:54.080
of the coagum, the glue that binds the neurons together into a coherent emergent intelligence,

04:54.080 --> 04:58.000
but also of a much more ancient roles for that same mechanism.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.840
And this has many applications, for example, on biomedicine.

05:01.840 --> 05:06.320
And at the end, I want to talk a little bit about synthetic bioengineering.

05:06.320 --> 05:10.440
I want to show you some novel creatures that have never existed before and talk a little

05:10.440 --> 05:14.720
bit about what this means for evolution and for many other fields.

05:14.720 --> 05:19.200
So single cells come in all shapes and sizes.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.200
This is a single cell.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.200
So this is a diatom.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.200
They are very tiny.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.760
So this is a single cell.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.000
This is also a single cell.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.840
This thing, which looks like a plant, it has a nice cap and a stalk and some roots here.

05:29.840 --> 05:34.200
It's actually an alga, the whole thing could be up to 10 centimeters in size.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.680
It's also a single cell.

05:35.680 --> 05:40.800
So if you're interested in morphogenesis by differentiating cells into different types,

05:40.800 --> 05:44.680
we already start to see that there's structure well below that.

05:44.680 --> 05:50.840
This thing has one nucleus and it manages to make this amazing shape without any differentiation.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.320
Cells are also competent in behavioral spaces.

05:53.320 --> 05:57.360
So what you're looking at here, this is a slime mold called physarum polycephalum.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.920
It has many nuclei, but it's still one cell.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.560
The whole thing is one cell.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.520
And what you can do is you can do this.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.360
You can put some objects in its vicinity.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.280
These white things are glass discs.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.240
They have no chemical on them, no food, nothing.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.640
They're completely inert.

06:10.640 --> 06:16.240
And if you put three on one side and one on the other, it will consistently choose to

06:16.240 --> 06:17.640
travel towards the three.

06:17.640 --> 06:22.680
What it's actually doing as we showed in this paper is it's actually sensing strain angle

06:22.680 --> 06:23.680
in the medium.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.480
It is incredibly sensitive to it.

06:25.480 --> 06:29.520
And it's pulsing, which you can't see here, but it's pulsing as a kind of sonar to build

06:29.520 --> 06:33.640
a map of its surroundings and migrate towards the heavier object.

06:33.640 --> 06:37.480
And what's kind of cool is that at this point here, for the first four hours, it sort of

06:37.480 --> 06:39.840
grows in all directions.

06:39.840 --> 06:44.400
And this is the point at which it's got enough information and now, boom, now it knows where

06:44.400 --> 06:45.560
to go at that point.

06:45.560 --> 06:49.000
But right here, you still can't really, you don't really know.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.440
But at this point, bang, it starts to.

06:51.440 --> 06:55.560
So there are all sorts of, so this is kind of the field of basal cognition and trying

06:55.560 --> 07:01.520
to understand how biology was solving various problems long before brains and neurons appeared.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.920
So I want to talk about three or four things today.

07:04.920 --> 07:09.880
The first thing I want to do is I want to twist some knobs on traditional cognitive

07:09.880 --> 07:18.040
science and talk about some unconventional agents that we can start thinking about.

07:18.040 --> 07:25.520
So this kind of picture, this is the classic painting of Adam naming the animals in the

07:25.520 --> 07:27.280
Garden of Eden.

07:27.280 --> 07:32.400
This kind of picture is really pretty prevalent in a lot of discussions, in the sense that

07:32.400 --> 07:40.280
people really think about finished adult organisms as the subjects of their study.

07:40.280 --> 07:44.520
So intelligence, they say the human brain or the rat or something like this.

07:44.520 --> 07:48.760
And what I want to do is stretch this in a number of dimensions, both in terms of the

07:48.760 --> 07:56.000
time evolution, the fact that everything comes from one cell at one point, and also the fact

07:56.000 --> 08:01.280
that drawing boundaries between different types of creatures is actually very difficult

08:01.280 --> 08:05.520
because of the interoperability of life and the ability to make chimeras.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.400
So the first thing we can think about is this.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.360
This is a caterpillar.

08:09.360 --> 08:13.560
This is a kind of soft-bodied robot that crawls around and it chews plants and it lives in

08:13.560 --> 08:15.440
a two-dimensional world.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.080
It has to turn into this.

08:17.080 --> 08:23.120
This is a completely different hard-bodied kind of creature which has to fly in a three-dimensional

08:23.120 --> 08:24.120
world.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.560
It doesn't care about leaves anymore, but it does want nectar.

08:26.560 --> 08:31.480
And so the behavioral and all of these repertoires are completely different.

08:31.480 --> 08:36.120
So during this time, what happens is the brain basically liquefies.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.920
Most of the connections are broken.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.360
Most of the neurons die.

08:39.360 --> 08:43.920
It gets reassembled and rebuilt into a brand new brain suitable for driving, this kind

08:43.920 --> 08:45.320
of creature.

08:45.320 --> 08:49.000
And one of the most amazing things is, and there are many examples that you can read

08:49.000 --> 08:55.040
about here, is that if you train this animal to have particular memories, those memories

08:55.040 --> 08:57.720
are recovered in the moth or butterfly that comes out.

08:57.720 --> 09:02.420
So despite the complete rewiring of the brain here, those memories remain.

09:02.420 --> 09:05.920
So as computer scientists, we can start thinking about, okay, what kind of medium could we

09:05.920 --> 09:14.000
have that is able to store information that survives radical remodeling of the structure

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
of the medium.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.560
But this metamorphosis is very interesting because this is not just evolutionary timescales.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.160
This is a single individual.

09:22.160 --> 09:26.480
So if you're into philosophy of mind and you wonder what's it like to be a caterpillar

09:26.480 --> 09:29.480
or a butterfly, here's kind of the next level question.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.800
What's it like to be a caterpillar turning into a butterfly?

09:33.480 --> 09:38.880
What is the experience of this process as your cognitive medium is being completely reshaped?

09:38.880 --> 09:40.640
Biology goes even further.

09:40.640 --> 09:41.640
These are plenaria.

09:41.640 --> 09:42.640
These are flatworms.

09:42.640 --> 09:45.120
You'll hear lots more about them later.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.400
Interesting thing about them, well, several interesting things.

09:47.400 --> 09:51.560
One is that you can cut them into pieces and every piece regenerates and becomes a completely

09:51.560 --> 09:52.840
normal worm.

09:52.840 --> 09:56.640
But what you could, and so they have a true brain, all the same neurotransmitters that

09:56.640 --> 10:00.480
you and I have centralized nervous system.

10:00.480 --> 10:05.560
What you can do is you can train them to expect food on these little laser-etched kind of

10:05.560 --> 10:09.000
a bumpy surfaces, cut off their heads.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.920
The tail sits there doing nothing for about 10 days and then they regrow a brand new brain

10:13.920 --> 10:18.080
and then you find out that the animal actually remembers where to find the food.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.840
So the memory survives complete decapitation.

10:20.840 --> 10:25.160
So the interesting thing about that is, okay, somehow it's stored in the rest of the tissue,

10:25.160 --> 10:27.960
maybe neural, maybe not neural, we don't know, fine.

10:27.960 --> 10:34.040
But also that information has to be imprinted onto the new brain that is constructed from

10:34.040 --> 10:35.040
scratch.

10:35.040 --> 10:42.360
So this idea of moving information around and what happens to cognitive information as

10:42.360 --> 10:45.400
anatomical information is being processed is really interesting, right?

10:45.400 --> 10:48.280
That's the nexus at which we do most of our work.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.040
And so now, finally, I want to show you an example.

10:51.040 --> 10:56.560
This bears on some of the evolutionary topics where this is a tadpole of a frog.

10:56.560 --> 11:00.160
So here are the nostrils, here's the mouth, here's the brain, here's the gut, here's the

11:00.160 --> 11:01.160
tail.

11:01.160 --> 11:04.680
Now you'll notice something very strange is that here with the eyes should be here, but

11:04.680 --> 11:05.680
they're missing.

11:05.680 --> 11:06.680
Instead, there's one on the tail.

11:06.680 --> 11:09.600
And we engineered it this way and I can talk later about how that's done.

11:09.600 --> 11:13.760
But the interesting thing is that when you make a tadpole with an eye on its tail, despite

11:13.760 --> 11:18.720
the fact that for millions of years, everything was perfectly set up to expect visual input

11:18.720 --> 11:23.120
from two regions right here into the optic tectum, these animals can see quite well.

11:23.120 --> 11:28.200
So we can do a tadpole, we made a machine that tests their learning and visual assays.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.240
This eye, in fact, makes an optic nerve.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.840
It synapses on the spinal cord, not on the brain.

11:33.840 --> 11:38.120
And that apparently is sufficient for the brain to recognize this.

11:38.120 --> 11:43.320
So you can imagine this weird sort of information bus onto which this organ is putting some

11:43.320 --> 11:46.320
sort of data and the brain says, oh yes, I know what that is.

11:46.320 --> 11:49.760
That's visual data, even though it's coming in from a completely bizarre location.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.200
No problem, right?

11:51.200 --> 11:57.160
So that kind of plasticity is going to be a major, major theme today because one of

11:57.160 --> 12:03.360
the things that I think is a constant theme in biology is that it does not over-train

12:03.360 --> 12:10.720
on priors, meaning that it plays the hands that it's dealt at any given moment.

12:10.720 --> 12:18.160
What evolution is making is hardware that is very good at dealing with a novelty because

12:18.160 --> 12:23.240
it doesn't actually have exact expectations and we'll get to some of that later.

12:23.240 --> 12:27.120
So the interesting thing, what I think makes all of that work, which of course is very

12:27.120 --> 12:31.280
challenging, we're still struggling to make technology like that, what makes all of this

12:31.280 --> 12:38.440
work is this multi-scale competency architecture where not only is biology nested dolls kind

12:38.440 --> 12:41.080
of at the structural level, that's obvious, everybody knows that.

12:41.080 --> 12:47.760
But actually, not only functionally but computationally, every level is solving different problems

12:47.760 --> 12:49.360
in their own space.

12:49.360 --> 12:55.120
And so I've been working on a framework, which I don't have time to really get into the details,

12:55.120 --> 13:00.880
but if anybody's interested, I can give you a link, that is going to enable us to think

13:00.880 --> 13:05.640
about very diverse intelligences, not only the kinds of things that people typically

13:05.640 --> 13:11.080
think about, but also to weird creatures, colonial swarms and bacterial mats and engineered

13:11.080 --> 13:16.160
new life forms and AIs and maybe alien life forms, whatever.

13:16.160 --> 13:23.200
And it's based in part on this kind of approach where, and this is from an old paper in the

13:23.200 --> 13:29.720
40s about setting up a scale of cognitive sophistication all the way from very simple

13:29.720 --> 13:35.240
to quite advanced, with the idea being that there's nothing here about nerves and brains

13:35.240 --> 13:39.800
and whatnot, it's a cybernetic approach that's very substrate independent and I think that's

13:39.800 --> 13:44.040
really important as we start to come up with frameworks that are really enable us to, for

13:44.040 --> 13:48.400
example, recognize alien intelligences.

13:48.400 --> 13:53.080
So what we think about is competency in diverse spaces.

13:53.080 --> 13:57.240
Now, the thing that human beings are very good at is recognizing intelligence of medium

13:57.240 --> 14:01.920
sized objects moving at medium speeds through three dimensional space, all our sense organs

14:01.920 --> 14:04.320
are sort of pointed that way, we're good at recognizing that.

14:04.320 --> 14:08.400
So we know when crows and things are doing intelligent navigation of three dimensional

14:08.400 --> 14:12.880
space, but actually life is navigating all kinds of really interesting spaces.

14:12.880 --> 14:17.600
So there's the space of possible gene expressions, and there's the space of possible physiological

14:17.600 --> 14:18.600
states.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.800
And then there's this, which we'll spend the most time talking about, which is morphospace.

14:21.800 --> 14:25.520
This is the space of possible anatomical configurations.

14:25.520 --> 14:34.200
So what I want to do next is talk about morphogenesis, the generation of body structure as the behavior

14:34.200 --> 14:37.720
of a collective intelligence of cells in this morphospace.

14:37.720 --> 14:41.520
So we want to think a little bit differently here.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.160
Let's ask a fundamental question.

14:44.160 --> 14:47.160
This is a cross section through a human torso.

14:47.160 --> 14:52.520
Look at this amazing order, all of this, the tissues, the organs, everything is in exactly

14:52.520 --> 14:56.000
the right place, the right orientation, relative to the right size.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.760
Where does this structure come from?

14:57.760 --> 15:01.720
You would think that it would take an incredible amount of information to specify all this.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.360
And by the way, what would that information even look like?

15:04.360 --> 15:06.600
What would the encoding and decoding be?

15:06.600 --> 15:10.160
Because we all start life like this as a collection of embryonic plastomeres.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.520
So I ask where is this information?

15:12.520 --> 15:16.440
And people intuitively nowadays will say, well, it's in the DNA, it's in the genome.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.440
But we can read genomes now, and we know what's in the genome.

15:19.440 --> 15:24.880
What's in the genome are protein sequences, the specification of a micro-level hardware

15:24.880 --> 15:26.160
that every cell gets to have.

15:26.160 --> 15:29.400
There's nothing in the genome directly about any of this.

15:29.400 --> 15:37.280
And so there's really a very deep set of questions about how does the cellular collective know

15:37.280 --> 15:38.280
what to make?

15:38.280 --> 15:39.720
How does it know when to stop?

15:39.720 --> 15:43.960
If a piece is missing as regenerative medicine workers, we would like to know how to convince

15:43.960 --> 15:45.640
the cells to build it again.

15:45.640 --> 15:49.480
And as engineers, and we'll get to this in the last part of the talk, we might ask, well,

15:49.480 --> 15:51.840
what else is possible given those exact same cells?

15:51.840 --> 15:54.920
What else can we get them to build with the same hardware?

15:54.920 --> 16:01.400
And so the reason that this kind of question is important is this.

16:01.400 --> 16:06.000
In addition to all the basic stuff, for the biology audiences, I always point out that

16:06.000 --> 16:10.200
pretty much every aspect of medicine with the exception of infectious disease, everything

16:10.200 --> 16:15.040
else, birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would

16:15.040 --> 16:19.560
be completely solved if we knew how to tell collections of cells what to build.

16:19.560 --> 16:23.000
If we could specify what three-dimensional structure we wanted the cells to build, all

16:23.000 --> 16:24.240
of this would go away.

16:24.240 --> 16:29.520
And so we can think about the future where this is kind of the end game for this whole

16:29.520 --> 16:32.800
field is what we really want as a kind of anatomical compiler.

16:32.800 --> 16:38.040
We want to sit down and draw the animal or plant that we want, not at the level of gene

16:38.040 --> 16:39.240
pathways or anything like that.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.560
You want to be able to draw the final goal here.

16:41.560 --> 16:46.800
I want a three-headed platform like this and with this kind of nervous system.

16:46.800 --> 16:47.880
This is what I want.

16:47.880 --> 16:52.000
And if we knew what we were doing, this compiler would take that description and convert it

16:52.000 --> 16:56.800
to a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells to get them to build exactly

16:56.800 --> 16:57.800
that.

16:57.800 --> 17:01.080
Now, we don't have anything remotely like this, despite all the incredible progress in

17:01.080 --> 17:02.320
genetics and biology.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.320
Why not?

17:03.320 --> 17:07.440
Well, here's one simple example.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.920
This is a baby axolotl.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.440
So axolotls are kind of salamander.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.320
This is a baby axolotl.

17:13.320 --> 17:14.760
Baby axolotls have legs.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.280
This is the tadpole of a frog.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.280
Frogs don't have legs.

17:17.280 --> 17:20.080
Now, one of the things you can make is you can make a chimeric embryo.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.280
We call it a frog-a-lottel.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.000
We're making these in our lab.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.240
And so I would pose this challenge.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.140
We have the genome for the axolotl.

17:29.140 --> 17:30.360
We have the genome for the frog.

17:30.360 --> 17:31.720
We have all the genetic information.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.160
Now, I ask a simple question.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.800
Will frog-a-lottels have legs or not?

17:35.800 --> 17:40.560
And there are no models in the field that will help you answer that question, none.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.160
Because even though we know a lot about the molecular pathways that are involved at the

17:44.160 --> 17:48.320
cellular level, we really don't understand very well how large-scale decisions are made.

17:48.320 --> 17:52.400
And in particular, not only can't we tell what the chimer is going to do, to be honest,

17:52.400 --> 17:54.320
we can't even tell what the individual is going to do.

17:54.320 --> 17:59.080
If you didn't already know what an axolotl was or you were able to compare that genome

17:59.080 --> 18:05.120
to other genomes, you would have no idea what the shape or the other properties of the animal

18:05.120 --> 18:07.120
were by looking at the genome.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.480
So where we are is this in biology.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.240
We're very good at this kind of thing.

18:11.240 --> 18:15.120
We're very good at manipulating cells and molecules and getting this kind of information.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.320
What we really want is something like this.

18:17.320 --> 18:21.000
We would like to be able to control large-scale anatomy.

18:21.000 --> 18:27.560
And to me, it reminds me of where computer science was a long time ago, where really

18:27.560 --> 18:31.640
one of the things you had to do was you always had to interact at the hardware level.

18:31.640 --> 18:35.080
So you would rewire the thing to get it to do something different.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.400
And this is where modern molecular medicine is.

18:37.400 --> 18:41.400
All of the exciting approaches are CRISPR genome editing.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.880
It's basically this.

18:42.880 --> 18:46.040
It's trying to manipulate the absolute lowest level.

18:46.040 --> 18:50.120
And I think we can do way better than that because evolution doesn't do this.

18:50.120 --> 18:56.440
Evolution exploits these amazing higher-level interfaces that we can now exploit as well.

18:56.440 --> 19:01.480
That give you access to all kinds of computation, modularity, and all kinds of other interesting

19:01.480 --> 19:02.480
things.

19:02.480 --> 19:07.200
So one of the things that we're interested in is a degree of intelligence.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.880
And by intelligence, I don't mean, of course, human-level intelligence.

19:09.880 --> 19:16.120
I mean something along the lines of that cybernetic kind of scale that Weiner gave us.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.760
And William James agreed.

19:17.760 --> 19:21.880
He said that intelligence is the ability to reach the same goal by different means.

19:21.880 --> 19:26.960
So this is, again, a very substrate-independent kind of functional definition.

19:26.960 --> 19:31.040
And so what I want to talk about in terms of this anatomy is this idea of an anatomical

19:31.040 --> 19:32.200
morphospace.

19:32.200 --> 19:37.400
So it's a virtual space of possible anatomical configurations.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.560
This is a simple example.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.040
These are snail shells.

19:40.040 --> 19:43.560
And every kind of a shell can be generated by an equation with three parameters.

19:43.560 --> 19:47.320
So you can build a three-dimensional kind of space.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.200
And every existing snail shell is somewhere in this space.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.560
And then there are lots of regions.

19:51.560 --> 19:56.200
And we can sort of argue about why those regions aren't populated by real organisms and so on.

19:56.200 --> 20:03.920
And so let's think about how much, if any, intelligence does a collection of cells have

20:03.920 --> 20:06.120
in navigating this morphospace.

20:06.120 --> 20:11.680
Well, here's the very kind of simplest thing you can do is you can take an early embryo.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.200
You can cut it in half.

20:13.200 --> 20:18.200
And what you don't get are two half bodies.

20:18.200 --> 20:22.320
What you actually get are two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.

20:22.320 --> 20:28.000
So you start to get this idea that development is reliable, but it isn't hardwired because

20:28.000 --> 20:30.840
if you introduce changes, it can still get to where it's going.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.960
So there are a variety of starting states.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.720
Maybe there are some local minima.

20:35.720 --> 20:39.280
But what it knows how to do is get around and get to a correct final state.

20:39.280 --> 20:43.880
This is being cut in half is not the normal state of affairs for embryos, but no problem.

20:43.880 --> 20:47.320
They can still get there even when half the cells are missing.

20:47.320 --> 20:51.640
Now this is a regeneration which works in a similar fashion.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.520
There's our axolotl.

20:53.520 --> 20:57.600
Axolotl's regenerate their eyes, their limbs, their jaws, which is absolutely amazing.

20:57.600 --> 21:01.980
And so what you can do is you can cut this limb anywhere along the length.

21:01.980 --> 21:06.160
It will build exactly what's missing, no more, no less, and then it stops.

21:06.160 --> 21:09.680
That's maybe the most amazing part of this process is this idea that it actually knows

21:09.680 --> 21:11.600
when to stop.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.600
When does it stop?

21:12.600 --> 21:14.880
Well, it stops when a correct salamander arm has been produced.

21:14.920 --> 21:21.000
So this is some kind of means and thing going on here where when the error is low enough,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
that's when it stops.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.800
And by the way, humans of course are not like axolotl's, but we can regenerate something.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.480
So the liver is highly regenerative.

21:29.480 --> 21:35.320
Human children regenerate their fingertips below a certain age, and deer regenerate huge

21:35.320 --> 21:38.160
amounts of bone and vasculature and innervation every year.

21:38.160 --> 21:41.360
So you can think about some of these examples.

21:41.360 --> 21:47.960
Now the other kind of competency that these cells have is really amazing, which is that

21:47.960 --> 21:52.760
I've shown you that as an embryo, you can't count on how many cells you have.

21:52.760 --> 21:57.400
So you have to be able to produce embryogenesis even when behalf of your cells are missing.

21:57.400 --> 22:02.560
But it turns out you can't even count on how much DNA you have or how big your cells are.

22:02.560 --> 22:07.440
So one thing you can do, this is kind of one of my favorite examples, this is a cross-section

22:07.440 --> 22:13.720
through a kidney tubule in a nuke, and normally it's 8 to 10 cells and they sort of work together

22:13.720 --> 22:18.280
to build this kind of tube, and here's a cross-section through that.

22:18.280 --> 22:21.720
What you can do, you can do this trick where early on in development you can prevent the

22:21.720 --> 22:26.040
cells from dividing for a bit, the DNA accumulates, every cell ends up with multiple copies of

22:26.040 --> 22:31.960
the genome, and then you let it go, and then development proceeds, but the cells are now

22:31.960 --> 22:32.960
much larger.

22:32.960 --> 22:33.960
They're huge.

22:34.200 --> 22:39.880
So no problem, despite the fact that you have too many copies of all your instructions

22:39.880 --> 22:44.720
in every cell, and the cells are huge, what will happen is a smaller number of those cells

22:44.720 --> 22:48.640
will work together to give you exactly the same structure, so they adjust to the cell

22:48.640 --> 22:49.640
size.

22:49.640 --> 22:54.000
But even better than that, if you make the cells truly gigantic by having eight times

22:54.000 --> 23:00.560
the amount of DNA in the original egg, what will happen is one cell will bend around itself,

23:00.560 --> 23:03.280
leaving a hole in the middle and give you the exact same tubule.

23:03.280 --> 23:07.600
Now what's cool about this is that this is top-down causation.

23:07.600 --> 23:13.800
This is the idea that cells will choose different molecular mechanisms to get the same job done

23:13.800 --> 23:15.120
at the anatomical level.

23:15.120 --> 23:19.160
So in service of getting the same large-scale structure, here what the cells are harnessing

23:19.160 --> 23:23.840
are cell-to-cell communication, here what the harnessing is cytoskeletal bending, completely

23:23.840 --> 23:27.000
different molecular mechanisms to get to the same step.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.760
So the idea is that this hardware that evolution has given us is able to make up for drastic

23:32.760 --> 23:36.520
changes of its component parts.

23:36.520 --> 23:41.540
And the final example, and so that last example was known since the 40s, it was discovered

23:41.540 --> 23:48.360
a long time ago, this is recent here, this is our work, and it's just a simple example

23:48.360 --> 23:53.200
of this kind of navigating morpho space.

23:53.200 --> 23:56.760
So here's your tadpole here, now this one has normal eyes, this is a normal tadpole,

23:56.760 --> 23:58.720
and it becomes a normal frog.

23:58.720 --> 24:02.200
But in order to do that, it has to rearrange its face, so the jaws have to move, the eyes

24:02.240 --> 24:06.080
have to move forward, the nostrils have to extend, like everything has to move.

24:06.080 --> 24:09.840
The traditional way of thinking about this was that, well, somehow the genome encodes

24:09.840 --> 24:14.000
some hard-wired cell behaviors so that every tissue moves the right direction in the right

24:14.000 --> 24:18.020
amount, and then you get your normal frog from the normal starting position.

24:18.020 --> 24:21.840
So we wanted to test this hypothesis, and we thought that actually, no, probably it's

24:21.840 --> 24:23.440
much more clever than that.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.400
So what we did was we created what we call Picasso tadpoles.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.040
So everything is in the wrong place, the eyes are in the side of the head, the mouth is

24:29.040 --> 24:32.160
on top, everything is scrambled.

24:32.160 --> 24:37.160
And the amazing thing is that these scrambled tadpoles still become pretty normal frogs,

24:37.160 --> 24:42.160
because all of these organs starting off at the incorrect position will move around until

24:42.160 --> 24:45.360
they get to where they're going, in fact, sometimes they go too far and actually have

24:45.360 --> 24:49.720
to double back, but everything will move around until it lands in this correct orientation,

24:49.720 --> 24:50.720
and then it stops.

24:50.720 --> 24:55.560
So what evolution actually gave us is some kind of an error minimization scheme that

24:55.560 --> 24:58.840
is able to make up for drastic defects.

24:58.840 --> 25:03.640
This has massive implications for evolution, because it means that if you have mutations

25:03.640 --> 25:08.480
that move your mouth off kilter or move your eye to your tail or do some kind of crazy

25:08.480 --> 25:11.760
thing like this, it isn't necessarily the end.

25:11.760 --> 25:16.560
And if they have other kinds of positive implications elsewhere in the body, now you get to explore

25:16.560 --> 25:20.960
those, because these organs are fairly competent in getting where they need to go, connecting

25:20.960 --> 25:24.400
up in the however they need to connect up and giving you some kind of functionality.

25:24.400 --> 25:28.280
It tends to smooth the evolutionary landscape by a massive amount.

25:28.840 --> 25:37.320
This whole kind of homeostatic process suggests that this basic emergent story that molecular

25:37.320 --> 25:43.120
biology tells in the textbooks, basically that the standard view of things is this,

25:43.120 --> 25:47.320
is that it's a feed-forward emergent process, basically that there are genes interacting

25:47.320 --> 25:51.680
with each other, some of them make proteins that do things, they're sticky or they diffuse

25:51.680 --> 25:56.480
or something, so there's this physics, and then there's this process of emergence.

25:56.520 --> 26:01.880
So simple rules, executed in parallel over massive amounts of tiny agents give you an

26:01.880 --> 26:02.880
emergent outcome.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.040
And this is true, of course this is true, all of this does happen, but I think it's

26:06.040 --> 26:12.400
massively incomplete, because one of the problems with this feed-forward kind of story is that

26:12.400 --> 26:18.160
in addition to evolutionary issues, if you as an engineer or a bio-worker in regenerative

26:18.160 --> 26:25.080
medicine, if you wanted to make a change up here, and this was truly a feed-forward process,

26:25.080 --> 26:28.840
you would have no idea what to do back here, because reversing this is impossible, this

26:28.840 --> 26:34.160
is a terrible inverse problem, and if you decided that you know I like this ax a little

26:34.160 --> 26:38.880
but it's missing a leg, or instead I want it to be a three-fold symmetry instead of

26:38.880 --> 26:41.200
bilateral symmetry, what genes would you change?

26:41.200 --> 26:45.560
We have absolutely no idea how to reverse this, I don't think it's a solvable problem.

26:45.560 --> 26:50.040
And as a result, the gains of things like genomic editing and CRISPR and so on, I think

26:50.040 --> 26:54.520
are going to hit a glass ceiling, because for the vast majority of problems, we don't

26:54.520 --> 26:56.320
know what to do down here.

26:56.320 --> 27:01.640
So what we focus on in our group is these feedback loops, the idea that what's actually

27:01.640 --> 27:07.760
going on here is that there are systems that measure error, they measure deviation from

27:07.760 --> 27:11.960
a set point, and then they activate both at the genetic level and at the level of physics,

27:11.960 --> 27:17.480
and this is what we'll talk about for the next bit, they try to get you closer to your

27:17.480 --> 27:18.480
set point.

27:18.480 --> 27:22.680
Now on the one hand, biologists of course know all about homeostasis and set points,

27:23.680 --> 27:27.680
but there are two weird things going on here.

27:27.680 --> 27:32.480
One is that the set point, unlike a typical biological set point, which might be metabolic

27:32.480 --> 27:37.360
level or pH or temperature or something like that, this is a complex data structure, this

27:37.360 --> 27:41.560
is some kind of anatomical descriptor of what this thing is supposed to look like.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.520
How do you store that kind of set point?

27:43.520 --> 27:48.920
The other thing is that it suggests that this whole system in a certain sense is goal-directed.

27:48.920 --> 27:55.640
Now not magically so, but in a cybernetic sense, like a thermostat, but still, biology

27:55.640 --> 28:01.800
doesn't, molecular biology and so on doesn't love discussing goals and things like that,

28:01.800 --> 28:07.320
even though we now have a perfectly good engineering science of it.

28:07.320 --> 28:10.960
What this kind of view does though is that it makes a very strong prediction, it predicts

28:10.960 --> 28:15.240
that if we wanted to make changes up here, if this is all true and there is some kind

28:15.240 --> 28:20.480
of a set point being stored and it's not purely feed-forward emergence, then what we

28:20.480 --> 28:26.080
should be able to do is find how that set point is being stored, learn to read it, learn

28:26.080 --> 28:30.480
to rewrite it, and then the cells would build something else without having to make any

28:30.480 --> 28:32.240
changes to the hardware down here.

28:32.240 --> 28:36.040
In other words, if it's true that there's some degree of reprogrammability, this idea

28:36.040 --> 28:41.720
that the collective compares to a pattern memory, builds to that pattern, we could change

28:41.720 --> 28:44.040
the pattern and not have to actually rewire the machine.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.200
How general is this?

28:45.200 --> 28:46.640
What else can these cells do?

28:46.640 --> 28:52.560
You can see this now tying back into the themes that I started off with, touring and such.

28:52.560 --> 28:57.960
For the next part of the talk, I want to show you an example of how this works because we've

28:57.960 --> 29:03.160
been looking for this and we think we found it and we've started to learn to read and

29:03.160 --> 29:04.840
write it.

29:04.840 --> 29:10.320
The medium of all of this, maybe not terribly surprising for any neuroscientist, is bioelectricity.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.760
How does this work in the brain?

29:12.760 --> 29:17.360
Real quick, just the hardware looks like this, there's a collection of cells in the network.

29:17.360 --> 29:23.040
They have ion channels which enable voltage states to exist and maybe propagate to their

29:23.040 --> 29:27.840
neighbors via these electrical synapses known as gap junctions, so that's the hardware.

29:27.840 --> 29:33.320
The commitment of neuroscience is that all of the electrophysiology that goes on, and

29:33.320 --> 29:40.400
so this group made an amazing video of zebrafish brain activity in a live fish thinking about

29:40.520 --> 29:45.960
whatever it is that fish think about, that the idea is that all of the memories, the

29:45.960 --> 29:54.640
goals, the cognitive content of that mind is embedded in this electrical activity and

29:54.640 --> 29:57.080
thus there's the idea of neural decoding.

29:57.080 --> 30:01.160
If we understood the encoding, we should be able to read out the physiological activity

30:01.160 --> 30:08.600
and then understand what the animal was thinking about or what its memories were and that kind

30:08.600 --> 30:09.600
of thing.

30:09.680 --> 30:15.560
It turns out that this same exact system works everywhere in your body, so this is an extremely

30:15.560 --> 30:18.920
ancient set of tools that the evolution uses.

30:18.920 --> 30:22.600
Every cell in your body has ion channels, most cells in your body have the exact same

30:22.600 --> 30:28.800
electrical synapses, there are neural transmitter signaling in most tissues of the body and

30:28.800 --> 30:31.400
so we can now think about a similar project.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.400
What about neuroscience outside of neurons?

30:34.400 --> 30:39.360
What if we could decode the electrical conversations that other cells were having with each other

30:39.360 --> 30:47.840
and understand how this kind of electrical glue was functioning outside of the brain

30:47.840 --> 30:53.680
and so this is an early frog embryo using very similar technology, we developed voltage-sensitive

30:53.680 --> 30:58.800
dye imaging, so the colors are voltages, they're of course very slowly changing compared to

30:58.800 --> 31:04.640
this, but you can, this is a time lapse over about 12 hours, you can see all the electrical

31:04.640 --> 31:08.480
conversations that the cells have with each other and all the patterning that goes on.

31:09.440 --> 31:15.080
Now we know what brains think about, they think about behavior in three-dimensional spaces

31:15.080 --> 31:20.720
and maybe linguistic spaces, what does the rest of the body think about using that same

31:20.720 --> 31:22.720
process?

31:22.720 --> 31:29.200
Well, whereas in the brain what you have here is you have an electrical network issuing

31:29.200 --> 31:35.400
commands to muscles to move the body through three-dimensional space, there's a very isomorphic

31:35.400 --> 31:41.080
kind of picture where actually long before that what the system was doing was issuing

31:41.080 --> 31:47.200
commands to individual cells to move the configuration of your body through morpho space, right?

31:47.200 --> 31:53.720
So what we think evolution did was this was first and then what it simply did was to pivot

31:53.720 --> 31:58.080
this whole thing to motion spaces instead of anatomical spaces.

31:58.080 --> 32:02.920
So we started, we got our inspiration from neuroscience, we steal a lot of tools and

32:02.920 --> 32:08.760
concepts from the neuroscientists and so here are some of the tools we use.

32:08.760 --> 32:13.560
First of all, we can do the imaging to see what the electrical activity is, we do a lot

32:13.560 --> 32:19.000
of quantitative simulation to understand how the voltages arise from the various ion channel

32:19.000 --> 32:24.560
activity, here's what some of these things look like, this is an early frog embryo putting

32:24.560 --> 32:29.520
its face together and one of the things you can see and so the grayscale here is the

32:29.560 --> 32:39.560
bioelectric voltage potentials across the tissue and this is one frame from that tissue,

32:39.560 --> 32:44.800
from that video, what you can see is that long before the genes turn on to actually pattern

32:44.800 --> 32:51.600
the face and long before the face really appears, you can already read out a pre-pattern, a

32:51.600 --> 32:55.920
bioelectrical pre-pattern of what the future face is going to look like, here's where the

32:55.920 --> 32:59.480
mouth is going to be, here's where the eye is going to be, here are the placodes, I'm

32:59.480 --> 33:03.640
showing you this one because it's the most obvious one to understand, there's other patterns

33:03.640 --> 33:07.720
that we need a lot of decoding but this one's kind of simple, you can see exactly what it's

33:07.720 --> 33:13.640
going to do and this pattern is functional, if I change the electrical properties of this,

33:13.640 --> 33:19.880
if I draw using either optogenetics or other tools to draw on this, I can wipe out this

33:19.880 --> 33:23.760
eye, I can put it somewhere else, I can change the location of the mouth, all of this is

33:23.760 --> 33:30.560
actually determinative, this is the set point that guides future cell activity, so that's

33:30.560 --> 33:35.120
a natural bioelectrical pattern, this is a pathological one, we'll talk about that momentarily

33:35.120 --> 33:40.760
but this is the one, there's an incipient tumor which we injected a human oncogene and

33:40.760 --> 33:46.800
before that tumor appears, you can already see the disruption where these cells are basically,

33:46.800 --> 33:51.360
that oncogene causes them to electrically isolate from their neighbors and basically

33:51.360 --> 33:55.040
at that point they're just amoebas treating the rest of the animal as external environment,

33:55.040 --> 33:59.360
they just disconnect from everything, so we use the same tools that neuroscientists use

33:59.360 --> 34:05.680
to control these electrical states, we can target the ion channels here, we can target

34:05.680 --> 34:10.360
the gap junction, so we can control the topology of the electrical network, we can control

34:10.360 --> 34:17.240
the specific states using optogenetics, using drugs, using ion channel mutations, no electric

34:17.240 --> 34:23.240
fields, applications, no waves, no magnets, no electromagnetics, this is exactly what

34:23.240 --> 34:29.400
neuroscientists do by controlling, by exploiting the actual interface that the system gives

34:29.400 --> 34:33.920
us to manipulate the computations that it does, so how do we know this is of any use,

34:33.920 --> 34:38.280
what happens when you do this, well there's one simple example, what we can do is I showed

34:38.280 --> 34:43.240
you a bioelectrical pattern that tells the animal where to put its eye, so well we can

34:43.240 --> 34:48.000
reproduce that pattern somewhere else by injecting ion channel genes, specific let's

34:48.000 --> 34:51.600
say potassium channels somewhere else, and so you can introduce that pattern onto the

34:51.600 --> 34:55.880
gut and that tells the gut cells, hey you need to make an eye here, and if you section

34:55.880 --> 35:00.560
that eye you get all the right lens, right in the optic nerve, you get all that stuff,

35:00.560 --> 35:05.360
now couple of interesting things, one is that the modularity is amazing because what we

35:05.360 --> 35:11.040
actually introduce is a very low information content signal, we don't give all the information

35:11.040 --> 35:14.240
that you need to know how to make an eye, what are all the 30 different cell types that

35:14.240 --> 35:17.560
are inside the eye, we don't produce any of that, it's very modular, it's a subroutine

35:17.560 --> 35:23.520
call, we say build an eye here and everything else, all the molecular cascades that actually

35:23.520 --> 35:28.600
require to build an eye and make retinal cells and all that, all that's downstream, so that's

35:28.600 --> 35:33.120
the first thing, it's highly modular, the second thing is that it has a really interesting

35:33.120 --> 35:40.820
competency, one of them is that in this case what you're looking at, this is a cross section

35:40.820 --> 35:45.660
of a lens, right here, sitting out in the tail somewhere of a tackle, and the blue cells

35:45.660 --> 35:51.140
are the ones that we actually injected with our ion channel, so we told these blue cells

35:51.140 --> 35:55.160
you need to make an eye, but there's not enough of them to make an eye, so very much like

35:55.160 --> 35:59.100
ants in an ant colony, what they do is they know how to recruit their neighbors, what

35:59.100 --> 36:02.100
they did is recruit a bunch of these brown cells which themselves were never touched

36:02.100 --> 36:06.780
by us, they're completely normal body cells and they're able to say to these cells, we

36:06.780 --> 36:09.980
need to make a lens here, there's not enough of us to make a lens, you're now going to

36:09.980 --> 36:14.300
participate, and that same thing is studied by people who work on collective insects and

36:14.300 --> 36:22.060
so on, this ability to gauge the sort of size of the project you're embarking on and recruit

36:22.060 --> 36:25.940
other members of the swarm to work with you, so these cells certainly have the ability

36:25.940 --> 36:32.220
to do that, you can make, using that same modulation we've discovered the code for things

36:32.220 --> 36:40.500
like inner ear organs, so otocysts, hearts, so inducing ectopic hearts, extra forebrain,

36:40.500 --> 36:44.660
extra limbs, here are some six-legged frogs here that you can see, and fins, now this

36:44.660 --> 36:48.820
is interesting, tadpoles aren't supposed to have fins, that's more of a fish thing,

36:48.820 --> 36:53.100
we'll get to that momentarily, and so one thing that we can do with this now that we're

36:53.100 --> 36:56.900
starting to sort of uncover some of the native subroutines that are there is we can use this

36:56.900 --> 37:01.820
in a regenerative medicine setting, so here's a frog, normally if a frog loses a leg here

37:01.820 --> 37:06.020
by 45 days later there's nothing, frogs don't regenerate their legs at this stage on like

37:06.020 --> 37:10.420
salamanders, but what we can do now is we can give it the signal that says hey you need

37:10.420 --> 37:16.340
to rebuild this leg, and what happens here is that the way we do that is with a drug

37:16.340 --> 37:21.700
that opens specific iron channels at the wound, it turns on the genes that you need to get

37:21.700 --> 37:26.220
started on regeneration, by 45 days you've already got some toes, you've got a toenail,

37:26.220 --> 37:31.460
eventually a very nice leg, which is touch sensitive and multile, so it's a very simple

37:31.460 --> 37:36.820
approach to, again we're not reprogramming stem cells, we're not 3D printing any tissues,

37:36.820 --> 37:41.060
this is that point about the programming I made earlier on, we do not want to interact

37:41.060 --> 37:47.140
with the system at the lowest level by telling molecular pathways or cells what to do, we

37:47.140 --> 37:51.100
want to discover the large scale subroutines and the large scale control structure that

37:51.100 --> 37:59.220
allows us to say build a leg, so we are at this point in trials in rodents, I have to

37:59.220 --> 38:04.460
do a disclosure here because this is Dave Kaplan and I are co-founders of Morphosuticals which

38:04.460 --> 38:10.460
seeks to apply this kind of approach to regenerative medicine hopefully someday for humans, so

38:10.460 --> 38:16.300
you can see that, that's kind of the applied side of the work, I want to switch to an amazing

38:16.300 --> 38:20.780
example, which really is going to help us understand some more aspects of this, which

38:20.780 --> 38:25.860
are that, these are the plenary, you can cut them into as many pieces as you want, I think

38:25.860 --> 38:32.180
the record is like 275 or something like that, they're immortal, they have no lifespan limit,

38:32.180 --> 38:37.820
they do not age, they're extremely resistant to cancer and they have the world's worst

38:37.820 --> 38:44.540
genome, we can talk about what that means later on if we have time, but they have incredible

38:44.580 --> 38:52.380
capacity for morphogenetic control, one of the interesting things is that, remember that

38:52.380 --> 38:59.460
I promised you at the beginning that we would be able to look for the pattern memory, we

38:59.460 --> 39:04.220
would look for that encoding of the set point, that anatomical set point that tells the cells

39:04.220 --> 39:09.260
what do we build and when are we complete, so I want to show you a story where we can

39:09.260 --> 39:12.900
rewrite that pattern memory and I've kind of shown you examples already, the thing with

39:12.940 --> 39:17.140
the face and the eye is kind of an example, but I think this is even better, so here's

39:17.140 --> 39:21.580
our plenary, it has one head and one tail, the anterior genes are up here, turned on

39:21.580 --> 39:25.860
at the head, turned off at the tail, fine, and if I amputate head and tail, this middle

39:25.860 --> 39:31.940
fragment reliably 100% of the time gives us a nice worm, now one of the things that we

39:31.940 --> 39:36.500
did was to discover a bioelectric circuit that actually told the cells, this fragment, well

39:36.500 --> 39:40.380
how many heads are you supposed to have, once the head and the tail are chopped off, which

39:40.460 --> 39:45.740
end is the head or maybe both should be the head, how would you know, so we discovered

39:45.740 --> 39:50.820
this electrical circuit and what we were able to do is to convert this perfectly normal

39:50.820 --> 39:56.740
one headed animal to a state that once we cut it, it makes a two headed worm, this is

39:56.740 --> 40:02.660
not Photoshop, these are real live animals and here's how it works, it's because if you

40:02.660 --> 40:08.580
look at this fragment, it has this bio electrical pattern that says one head, one tail and that's

40:08.620 --> 40:12.860
what the cells build, but what we can do is we can take using various ways to modulate

40:12.860 --> 40:18.940
ion channels, we can convert this pattern to this pattern, now it's a little messy,

40:18.940 --> 40:22.940
but you can see here the technology is still very much being worked out, but you can see

40:22.940 --> 40:27.780
what's happening here, there are two, now the codes is two heads and sure enough, if

40:27.780 --> 40:32.740
I now cut this animal, there he is, now here's a very important point that we need to understand,

40:32.740 --> 40:38.700
this electrical map is not a map of this two headed creature, this electrical map is

40:38.700 --> 40:44.020
a map of this one headed animal in which we have manipulated the electric circuit such

40:44.020 --> 40:50.060
that the voltage looks like this, it sits there being one headed until it's injured

40:50.060 --> 40:53.980
and at that point the cells consult this map and build this two headed worm, so the bio

40:53.980 --> 40:58.620
electrical pattern is not a read out of the current anatomy, this is a, you can think

40:58.620 --> 41:02.700
about this as a primitive counterfactual memory, this is a memory of something that is not

41:02.740 --> 41:07.580
happening right now, in fact may never happen, but if it does, if we get injured, this is

41:07.580 --> 41:11.780
what a correct worm is supposed to look like and we will keep rebuilding until this is

41:11.780 --> 41:17.940
the pattern we get, so this is an encoded set point, a single headed planarian body can

41:17.940 --> 41:22.980
encode at least one of two different ideas of what a planarian is supposed to look like,

41:22.980 --> 41:27.980
maybe no doubt more, we just said we found it, we found two, so this is very important,

41:27.980 --> 41:32.540
this is the basics of counterfactual memory, this electric circuit can hold at least one

41:32.580 --> 41:37.580
of two different representations of what correct planarian should look like and upon injury

41:37.580 --> 41:41.420
the cells don't, this is their reference point, they have nothing else to gauge by, now why

41:41.420 --> 41:45.860
do I keep calling it a memory, because like every good memory, it is not only rewritable

41:45.860 --> 41:52.020
but it's long term stable, so if I take these two headed worms and now I amputate the head

41:52.020 --> 41:57.060
and I amputate this other topic head and I leave just the nice normal mid fragment, no

41:57.060 --> 42:01.300
more treatments of any kind, plain water, the genetics haven't been changed, we never

42:01.340 --> 42:04.620
edited the genome, there's nothing wrong with the genetics of this animal, so you might think

42:04.620 --> 42:08.580
that okay well once you've cut this off, now you'll go back to normal, and that's not what

42:08.580 --> 42:15.900
happens, so these animals forever in perpetuity now generate two headed worms, so where is

42:15.900 --> 42:20.580
the fact, where is it stored that they're now two headed worms, it is stored in the

42:20.580 --> 42:25.140
electrical pattern distributed over the cells, that pattern has a memory property, once you've

42:25.140 --> 42:29.380
changed it, it holds and in fact now we know how to change it back, so we can take that

42:29.380 --> 42:33.620
pattern, change it back to a one headed and then you get a line of one headed animals,

42:33.620 --> 42:41.660
so the answer to how, what determines how many heads Plinaria have is not really nailed

42:41.660 --> 42:45.980
down by the genetics, what the genetics does is it gives you an electric circuit that by

42:45.980 --> 42:52.060
default says one head, but that circuit is reprogrammable, you can change it to say two

42:52.060 --> 42:57.420
heads and it will hold state as far as we can tell forever, and then you can sort of

42:57.540 --> 43:01.820
flip it back and forth, so you can think of this as a distributed flip flop, and here

43:01.820 --> 43:10.980
are these two headed Plinaria in their native habitat, so what we're doing now, so there's

43:10.980 --> 43:14.500
a lot of computational work that needs to happen, one thing is that we're trying to map

43:14.500 --> 43:20.380
out the bioelectric state space of that circuit to understand why certain parts of it correspond

43:20.380 --> 43:25.460
to one head, two head and so on, and view that kind of regeneration as a kind of energy

43:25.500 --> 43:28.900
minimization process, where basically what you're doing, and this will be familiar to

43:28.900 --> 43:34.180
all of you who study this kind of stuff, to recover these pattern memories when they are

43:34.180 --> 43:43.780
damaged, and so we really want to see if some of the tools of connectionist kinds of computer

43:43.780 --> 43:47.540
science can help us understand what's going on here, the link between the physics of the

43:47.540 --> 43:52.660
circuit and the information processing of memory, of recall, of energy minimization and so on.

43:52.740 --> 43:57.220
Now, I want to show you how far we can go with this, so here I've shown you one head,

43:57.220 --> 44:01.740
two head, I mean that's pretty cool, but these are normal heads that belong to these animals

44:01.740 --> 44:06.060
anyway, but one thing you can do is you can push them into further attractors in that state

44:06.060 --> 44:11.300
space that belong to other species, so I can take this triangular shaped worm with no genetic

44:11.300 --> 44:17.100
change whatsoever, with completely normal hardware I can cause, just by disrupting that

44:17.100 --> 44:20.940
electrical decision making when you cut off the head, they have to decide what the head

44:21.420 --> 44:25.900
shape is, I can make flat heads like the Pifelina, we can make round heads like an S-Mediterranean,

44:25.900 --> 44:31.180
or of course we can make the normal ones. The shape of the brain becomes just like these other

44:31.180 --> 44:37.420
species, the distribution of stem cells in the brain becomes just like these other species,

44:37.420 --> 44:44.140
they can access, a genetically normal set of cells can access other morphological attractors

44:44.940 --> 44:48.780
if you push them that way along this bioelectrical interface.

44:49.740 --> 44:53.820
You can even push them further and you can make, you can reach shapes that don't belong to

44:53.820 --> 44:58.380
plenary at all, so you can make these kind of hybrid forms, you can make radially symmetrical,

44:58.380 --> 45:03.900
you know sort of ski cap looking things, you can make these weird spiky forms, there's a tremendous

45:03.900 --> 45:10.620
variety of anatomical forms that you can achieve if you interfere with the ability of these cells

45:10.620 --> 45:15.580
to navigate morpho space, what they want to do is to reach this region of the morpho space,

45:15.580 --> 45:19.420
and they're very good at it, but now that we found this electrical process by which they

45:19.420 --> 45:27.420
navigate, we can push them into other areas. So what we're doing now is we're building some,

45:27.420 --> 45:33.900
so we have a very biorealistic computational simulator of electrical activity, so we can

45:33.900 --> 45:39.660
sort of look at the circuits at the tissue level, how do they rescale and all of that,

45:39.660 --> 45:46.300
and then we're trying, the goal, long-term goal, is this kind of full stack model where we start

45:46.300 --> 45:51.340
with the facts of which ion channels are expressed, so that's where the genetics plays out, and that's

45:51.340 --> 45:56.140
your hardware, but then at the tissue level, what are all the voltage dynamics? They're really not

45:56.140 --> 46:01.020
obvious because all of these channels, a lot of them are voltage gated, that's a voltage gated

46:01.020 --> 46:04.940
current conductance, that's a transistor, so when you put these things into circuits,

46:05.820 --> 46:11.100
all kinds of symmetry breaking loops, they have all, they can do memory as I just shown you,

46:11.100 --> 46:16.220
they have all kinds of interesting computations, but very nonlinear, hard to predict, and so then

46:16.220 --> 46:22.300
we want to understand this decision making of head versus tail versus what else, and to the point

46:22.300 --> 46:26.140
where we get to an algorithmic model, so we're using some machine learning approaches to try and

46:26.140 --> 46:31.740
extract actually kind of white box algorithmic models, so that then at this point we can say,

46:31.740 --> 46:37.660
okay, but what would we need to do if we wanted a fatter worm or three heads or, you know,

46:37.660 --> 46:41.980
somebody needed a new finger or a new eye or something like that? Okay, so for the last bit,

46:41.980 --> 46:46.140
I'm just gonna finish up with a couple of things. I want to talk about very quickly

46:47.820 --> 46:54.300
this idea of, because what I've shown you is the collective intelligence of individual cells

46:54.300 --> 46:59.100
solving a very large-scale problem, they solve a problem that the individual cells don't have,

46:59.100 --> 47:04.940
so I want to talk about this idea of scaling. This is what evolution does. Evolution takes

47:04.940 --> 47:13.180
this kind of creature and enables them to connect with each other to solve problems

47:13.180 --> 47:17.420
at the level of anatomical morphospace, so for example, if we don't have enough fingers,

47:17.420 --> 47:21.500
we will know that the tissue knows that and can regenerate the right number of fingers,

47:21.500 --> 47:25.340
then it stops. Individual cells have no idea what a finger is or how many fingers there are

47:25.340 --> 47:29.900
or anything like that, but the collective does, and so what evolution does is this amazing scaling

47:29.900 --> 47:35.340
up, but that process has a failure mode. That failure mode is known as cancer, so what happens in

47:35.340 --> 47:42.220
cancer is that when individual cells disconnect from this electrical network, they go back to being

47:42.220 --> 47:48.060
a single cell amoebas where their goals are now maximal proliferation and maximal metabolic gain

47:48.060 --> 47:53.100
instead of having goals in anatomical morphospace, so this is human glioblastoma, these are cells,

47:53.420 --> 47:59.900
crawling around in culture with no inclination to work hard towards these kinds of things.

47:59.900 --> 48:06.300
So what happens is that the magic here is in these electrical connections, these gap junctions

48:06.300 --> 48:11.820
that allow cells to share information very tightly, and in particular, their synapses,

48:11.820 --> 48:16.780
they're called synapses because they are open and closed by prior experiences, meaning that

48:16.780 --> 48:21.980
the information that moves through a particular synapse also feeds back because of their voltage

48:21.980 --> 48:26.780
sensitivity to open and close that synapse, so you have this kind of activity-dependent memory,

48:26.780 --> 48:33.580
and so that allows a tissue to have much larger cognitive light cones in terms of how much do

48:33.580 --> 48:38.620
they remember, how much can they anticipate, how much can they measure than individual cells,

48:38.620 --> 48:44.620
that's the scale-up, and so another biomedical application that we're working on is to force

48:44.620 --> 48:50.220
that connection, so here is this, we inject an oncogene, so normally it would make a tumor,

48:50.220 --> 48:54.140
here it is, the oncogene is blazingly expressed, in fact it's all over the place here,

48:54.140 --> 48:58.860
but there is no tumor because what we've done is we've co-injected a very specific ion channel

48:58.860 --> 49:03.020
that forces that cell to remain an electrical connection with their neighbors, so when you

49:03.020 --> 49:06.700
force them, even if the genetics are screwed up, so I've shown you a number of examples where

49:06.700 --> 49:12.940
the genetics is diverting from the actual outcome, what the hardware says is one thing,

49:12.940 --> 49:16.700
but you can make changes, and we have lots of other examples of fixing birth defects and other

49:16.700 --> 49:22.620
things in software by temporary electrical states that push the system in a way that

49:23.900 --> 49:29.100
it normally wouldn't have done, and so this is a tumor normalization technology that we're also

49:29.100 --> 49:34.300
trying to move to a medical outcome, so what we're trying, the big mystery here, what we're

49:34.300 --> 49:42.300
trying to do now is to make computational models of local homeostatic loops that started out in

49:42.300 --> 49:49.180
bacteria by managing pH and metabolics and things like that, and show how by connecting these, so

49:49.180 --> 49:52.700
basically what you have is a network of homeostats, so you have a network of these things that are

49:52.700 --> 50:04.700
able to control local variables towards set points, and by connecting them you are enabling the

50:04.700 --> 50:09.900
collective to now do the same thing, but in a much much different space, and so this is the

50:09.900 --> 50:14.780
kind of big area where we need to understand lots more, and so these are the kind of models

50:14.780 --> 50:19.020
that we're thinking about. Okay, so for the last kind of couple of minutes, I want to talk about

50:19.660 --> 50:27.020
this idea of novel organisms, so we wanted, oh, and I have to do another disclosure, this is we

50:27.020 --> 50:33.020
also have a spin-off company for biorebotics called Fauna Systems, and this is all the work

50:33.020 --> 50:37.740
with Josh Baumgart at University of Vermont, with whom we've started this thing, the Institute for

50:37.740 --> 50:43.900
Computationally Designed Organisms. We wanted to ask a simple question, how far does this plasticity

50:43.900 --> 50:49.660
go? I've shown you that normal embryos are able to adapt to changes of cell number, cell shape,

50:49.660 --> 50:57.740
amount of DNA, but also you can push them to make, you can make worms with the heads that belong to

50:57.740 --> 51:03.740
other species and worm bodies that are just not normal plenaria worms, so how far does that plasticity

51:03.740 --> 51:10.140
go? And in particular, if you take cells away from their normal context, can they reboot their

51:10.140 --> 51:15.180
multicellularity? What will they do? And so we did this experiment, I'm going to pause this right

51:15.180 --> 51:21.100
here, so this is a frog embryo in cross-section, if you take off this top part here, these all of

51:21.100 --> 51:25.580
these cells up here are going to be skin, they're all faded to be different kinds of epidermis,

51:26.380 --> 51:30.460
and so we asked this question, if I take these cells, I disassociate them,

51:31.180 --> 51:37.180
I put a little drop of them in a separate environment away from all of this stuff, so

51:37.180 --> 51:44.380
I'm not, we're not adding any kind of, and by the way the person who physically does this is

51:44.380 --> 51:48.940
Doug Blackiston in our group, he's a staff scientist who perfected a lot of these protocols,

51:49.580 --> 51:53.900
we're not adding synthetic biology constructs, we're not changing the DNA, we're not putting

51:53.900 --> 51:58.700
any weird nano materials, we're engineering by subtraction, we're taking away the instructive

51:58.700 --> 52:03.580
signals from all of this stuff, and so what would they do? Well, they might die, they might spread

52:03.580 --> 52:07.500
out and sort of crawl away from each other, they might form a two-dimensional monolayer like cell

52:07.500 --> 52:12.620
culture, we don't know, but those are some things they might do, instead what they do is, so here

52:12.620 --> 52:17.740
these are loose cells, this is time-lapse, so overnight they sort of come together and they

52:17.740 --> 52:22.380
merge into this little thing, this little round thing, the flashes or calcium flashes, we'll talk

52:22.380 --> 52:27.980
about that momentarily, what does it do? So this is a little ball of skin, what does a little ball

52:27.980 --> 52:33.260
of skin do? Well the first thing it does is, it takes little hairs that are normally used on the

52:33.260 --> 52:39.020
skin to move the mucus down the body of the animal, and it uses those hairs to swim, it rose

52:39.660 --> 52:46.300
through the media by pushing the little hairs in opposite directions to the left and right of a

52:46.300 --> 52:52.860
midline that it can organize, here you can see some behaviors, so they can go in circles, they can

52:52.860 --> 52:59.180
sort of patrol back and forth, they can hear some tracking data on group behavior, so this guy's going

52:59.180 --> 53:05.740
on kind of a long journey, these are interacting with each other, then sometimes they sit still

53:05.740 --> 53:10.300
for long periods of time, they have autonomous motion, this is what they look like in a maze,

53:10.300 --> 53:14.620
so this is a water maze, there's no flow, there are no gradients, it's just still spring water,

53:14.620 --> 53:19.420
it goes down here, it takes the corner without having to bump into the outside wall, so it doesn't

53:19.500 --> 53:24.540
have to bump into anything, it just follows the corner, and then around this at this point, let's

53:24.540 --> 53:28.060
play it again, so remember this is just skin, there are no brain, there's no brain, there's no nervous

53:28.060 --> 53:33.660
system, so it takes this corner, and at this point for some reason that we don't know, internal

53:33.660 --> 53:37.420
behaviors, it turns around and goes back where it came from, doesn't want to keep going anymore,

53:37.420 --> 53:42.540
so they have a range of behaviors, if you ask what does the calcium signaling look like, again no

53:42.540 --> 53:49.180
neurons here, but the skin is actually very active with very brain-like dynamics, which we are now

53:49.180 --> 53:53.100
analyzing using information theory and things like that, to see what's going on and whether they

53:53.100 --> 53:57.340
might be talking to each other, they have regenerative capacity, so if I cut it in half,

53:57.340 --> 54:03.020
they will try to fold up to their new xenobot shape, with the amazing force to the 180-degree hinge

54:03.020 --> 54:08.620
that they have to deploy to fold themselves up, and the most amazing thing that they do is this,

54:08.620 --> 54:17.180
this is, so Josh and his student Sam Creedman did computational simulations of these guys in a

54:17.180 --> 54:21.820
virtual world with different shapes that we, you know, that Doug was able to actually make,

54:21.820 --> 54:26.940
and we saw something very interesting that in the computational kind of simulation,

54:26.940 --> 54:34.140
one of the things they do is they rearrange the particles in their environment

54:34.140 --> 54:39.340
into specific shapes, that was a prediction of the simulation, so we tried, we gave them some

54:39.340 --> 54:43.580
particles, what did we give them, we gave them cells, loose cells, this is the white stuff,

54:43.660 --> 54:47.980
the snow here, that those are loose cells, and what you see is that the xenobots run around,

54:47.980 --> 54:58.220
they corral these particles into little piles, and then they sort of continue to polish those

54:58.220 --> 55:02.780
little piles until they become kind of these circular things, and then because what we did

55:02.780 --> 55:08.060
was we gave them skin cells, these little piles became the next generation of xenobots, and so

55:08.060 --> 55:12.700
guess what, when they matured, they went and did the same thing, and they created the next generation

55:12.700 --> 55:19.100
of xenobots, so this is Von Neumann's dream, this is a machine that runs around and makes copies

55:19.100 --> 55:24.300
of itself from particles that it, or the parts that it finds in its environment, the only reason

55:24.300 --> 55:29.100
this trick works, of course, is because like evolution, and like us, it's working within a

55:29.100 --> 55:35.020
gentle material, it's working with cells that are not passive pebbles, but are actually materials

55:35.020 --> 55:40.300
that when you collect them into a little pile, they already have the competency of becoming

55:40.300 --> 55:46.620
a xenobot, so it actually takes very little to get this reproductive cycle happening,

55:46.620 --> 55:51.420
so the last couple of things I just want to say is this, we can learn some interesting things from

55:51.420 --> 55:57.820
this, this is the standard Xenopus lavas genome, the standard frog, if you only observe standard

55:57.820 --> 56:03.180
development, you are really lulled into a false sense of security, you're given the idea that,

56:03.180 --> 56:09.420
well, acorns always make oak trees, frog eggs always make frogs, the genome determines morphology,

56:09.420 --> 56:14.300
this is what they can make, they make an embryo that has a certain set of developmental sequences

56:14.300 --> 56:21.820
and then a certain behaviors, that's what this hardware makes. Actually, if you liberate these

56:21.820 --> 56:25.740
skin cells, so what do skin cells know how to do? Well, of course, they know how to be a boring

56:25.740 --> 56:31.340
two-dimensional outer layer on this animal, keep out the bacteria, that's it, well, that's what

56:31.340 --> 56:36.620
they do when the other cells sort of bully them into that role, the instructive interactions

56:36.620 --> 56:41.580
from the other cells are what's constraining the capacity of these skin cells to sit quietly as

56:41.580 --> 56:47.740
the outer layer and that's that. On their own, given the ability to escape these instructive

56:47.740 --> 56:51.820
interactions, they're actually capable of much more, they make a xenobite, they undergo a

56:51.820 --> 56:55.260
developmental sequence over the next two months, they become this thing, I don't know what the

56:55.260 --> 57:03.740
heck this is, they have their own kind of weird developmental trajectory and their behaviors

57:03.740 --> 57:09.740
are things like making copies of themselves via kinematic self-replication. Now, this is interesting

57:09.740 --> 57:15.340
because for every other creature on earth, if you were to ask why does it have a certain shape,

57:15.340 --> 57:20.140
a certain behavior, how does it be able to do whatever it is that it does, the answer is always

57:20.140 --> 57:24.540
the same, well, years of selection, right, eons of evolutionary pressure to do this or that,

57:25.180 --> 57:28.780
there's never been any xenobots, there's never been any evolutionary pressure to be a good

57:28.780 --> 57:35.180
xenobot, to do kinematic self-replication to any of the behaviors that they do and the morphology,

57:35.180 --> 57:39.340
there's never been any pressure for that. So, where does this come from, right, this plasticity,

57:39.340 --> 57:45.820
this amazing fact that evolution gave us this genome that very reliably does this, but it also

57:45.820 --> 57:49.740
can do this and who knows what else, right, I think we're just scratching the surface. So,

57:49.740 --> 57:55.100
I'm going to end here and just say that the main points, I think, that are emerging from all our

57:55.100 --> 58:00.940
work, including many things I didn't show you, is this. Evolution tends to build generic problem

58:00.940 --> 58:07.580
solving machines, which because of this kind of compression of complex bodies into a single cell

58:07.580 --> 58:14.540
during sexual reproduction, really enables some amazing hardware that exploits aspects of physics

58:14.540 --> 58:20.060
and computation that doesn't try to pre-code everything. And development shows us that these

58:20.060 --> 58:26.220
kind of agents in morphospace and in other spaces really have to deal with whatever they're given

58:26.220 --> 58:33.580
at the beginning. They are not, in the large part, they are not tied to a very specific, very tight

58:33.580 --> 58:39.660
set of initial conditions. And we can also talk about, there's this intelligence ratchet that's

58:39.660 --> 58:45.820
formed because that competency actually hides a lot of genomic fitness information from evolution.

58:45.820 --> 58:50.060
So, a lot of the effort goes into that competency, actually, as opposed to the hardware.

58:50.940 --> 58:56.780
And the physiology, especially the bioelectrics, can navigate various problem spaces with all

58:56.780 --> 59:01.580
kinds of competencies, all kinds of interesting competencies. And then, synthetic bioengineering

59:01.580 --> 59:10.380
tells us that life, because of all of this, life is extremely interoperable. We can make any kind of

59:11.020 --> 59:19.180
combination of hardware, software. This is one of my favorite kind of videos. This is an early

59:19.180 --> 59:23.020
baby mantle, discovering for the first time what kinds of effectors it has. Look at this,

59:23.020 --> 59:28.220
I've got legs, I've got arms, amazing. So, one of the, they don't know. You see, you don't know

59:28.220 --> 59:33.580
ahead of time when embryos are born into this world, much like Josh Bongard's robots.

59:35.180 --> 59:39.900
They don't know right away what they have, where their boundaries with the outside world is.

59:39.900 --> 59:44.300
All of that has to be computationally defined spontaneously. So, if we're thinking about

59:46.940 --> 59:51.020
how intelligence has come into this world, here's what the biology is telling us.

59:51.020 --> 59:55.660
Multiscale competencies, lots of levels, as Daniel was talking about at the very beginning,

59:55.660 --> 01:00:01.020
competing and cooperating with each other. Spontaneous emergence of boundaries, energy

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:07.020
constraints, which require you to do core, coarse graining on your inputs. Self-modeling,

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:11.580
all of this kind of stuff is what biology is telling us. And because of this interoperability,

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:17.820
everything that we know in the natural world, all of the Darwin's endless forms, most beautiful,

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:23.580
are just the tiny corner of this option space. Every combination of evolved material,

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:30.300
designed machinery, and software is some kind of agent. And a lot of this already exists.

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:36.620
So, hybrid, cyborgs, all kinds of things where the future is going to look like this. And that

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:41.900
really means that we have to redefine a lot of our old categories that started out by looking at

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:46.620
this picture of the Garden of Eden, where you have a standard human, you have some standard animals,

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:51.900
and that's it. And you can draw a simple line and you know what's going on. That picture is gone.

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:55.980
So, I'm just going to close here. There are some papers that if anybody's interested in

01:00:55.980 --> 01:01:00.860
diving further into these issues, here's some papers I could send you. I want to thank all

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:06.540
the people that did the work. So, Doug and Sam did all the Xenobot work. Here are the other

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:11.260
students and postdocs that contributed to this stuff, our collaborators, our funders,

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:15.740
most of all, our model systems, the animals do most of the heavy lifting here.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.580
And that's it. Thank you for listening and I will take any questions.

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:23.100
Oh, thank you for a truly marvelous talk.

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:24.460
Thank you.

01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:32.620
So, yes. And yeah, so we have a few minutes for questions. I think you said we have about

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:42.380
10 minutes left. So, yeah, okay. Yes, Daniel, I think you were first.

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:47.980
Hey, if I start asking, nobody else will have time. So, I'll leave the others and

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.780
leave my mind for the last.

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.180
Okay, Christoph, I thought I saw your hand.

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.580
Oh, sorry, I was just clapping.

01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:06.540
Oh, okay, okay. Well, anyone else before I start asking questions as well.

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:18.060
So, okay, in that case, I have too many questions and I don't know enough about it.

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:24.380
And I'd really like to know more about these bioelectrical patterns and how you, I don't know,

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:31.900
for instance, seem to have gained control over how to manipulate those, say for, you know,

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:37.660
you fix the genetics and you give it the somehow the phenotype of a different creature,

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:43.980
a different animal entirely. That is absolutely mind blowing, I have to say. And how,

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:49.660
I mean, it almost seems like, you know, you could make the phenotype of,

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:57.020
it almost seems like the genetics isn't as important as we, as we thought it, I mean,

01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:03.420
yeah, as we thought it would be. I mean, it's just, yeah, to how, to what extent can you get

01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:09.180
something with a sort of drastically, how drastically different can the phenotype end up?

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:16.620
I think, I think that, well, look, in the, in the plan area, it's 150 million years difference

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:21.420
between the animals that we start with and the ones that we can make. And it's equivalent to

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:26.860
150 million years of evolutionary distance to these other species. Plus, of course, we can make

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:30.780
shapes that never existed, that never existed. So, you know, I don't know what the distance

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:36.460
there would be. But I think it's a very important point. I think absolutely the role of the genome

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:42.700
is not what we thought it was. You know, one of the, one of the key things here is though,

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:45.420
is that I think, and a lot of people get very suspicious about, you know,

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:49.260
sort of computer science analogies, but I think, I think the part that is actually very,

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:55.100
very useful is the distinction between hardware and software. So I think that tells us what,

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:59.660
you know, the genome, this, this, there's the, you know, some of our students are taught this,

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:04.380
this that, well, you know, the cell is the, is the hardware that interprets the genome and the

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:08.300
genome is the software of this. I think that's, that's completely wrong. I think what, what the

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:12.460
genome actually does is nail down the hardware of the cell. The genome tells you what channels

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:16.620
you're going to have. If your genome does not give you a voltage-gated ion channel,

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:20.620
there's very limited, you don't have those transistors, there's very limited things you can

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:26.540
do. So the hardware is critical because it, it, it, it facilitates or forbids certain kinds of

01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:31.980
behavior modes. But we all know now that knowing the hardware does not tell you all of the

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.260
interesting things you need to know about what this thing is going to be able to do.

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:40.220
Not only does it, that is, that can the same hardware run many different kinds of, of, of

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:46.540
behavior modes, but also it means that the way you interact with it does not have to be at the

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:51.420
hardware level, right? That, that's kind of the huge, the huge insight to me of, of, of, of, of

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:55.580
computer science is this idea of reprogrammability. There, there are certain, that once you get beyond

01:04:55.580 --> 01:05:01.580
a certain capacity, and I think biological systems are way beyond that, you can, you can interact

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:07.020
with it via inputs, via stimuli, via communication, via, you know, who knows how high that goes,

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:13.980
not just by rewiring it. And so I think that all of this, you know, the focus on, on the DNA,

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:19.020
both as the source of the information and as the optimal control knob, right, all the excitement

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:23.260
over genomic editing and everything else, those things I think are, are misplaced. But that's

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:26.380
not to say that the genome isn't important. I mean, you need to have the right hardware. If you

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:29.420
don't have the right hardware, it's not, you're not, you're not going to be able to do certain

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:34.300
things. So it's like there's a whole area of interaction with physics, what this hardware

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:40.220
can do that, you know, there is some physics that it exploits, and that doesn't need to be in the

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:48.060
genome. And yeah, it's, yeah. Yeah, that's, that's a very profound, that's a very profound idea,

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:53.580
which is that, and people have been thinking about this actually in, in, in mathematics for the longest

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:58.460
time. So, so where do the truths of number theory live, right, where, where, you know, you could

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:02.780
change all the facts of, of the initial conditions of the universe, and the number theory would

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:07.980
still be what it is, right? And so, so think about this, right? If you were to try to evolve a

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:12.620
triangle, so you evolve the first angle, you evolve the second angle, but guess what, you don't

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:16.540
need to evolve the third angle, you know what it is, right? Where does that come from, that, that,

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:22.860
you know, that's an amazing kind of free lunch, you know, as the physicists would say, right?

01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:26.940
And, and the same thing with computation. So once you evolve that ion channel,

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:30.700
that's basically a transistor. So now you get to have logic gates and truth tables.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:35.020
Did you have to evolve a truth table? No, you got that for free. Where do truth tables live?

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:38.780
You know, I don't know, but that's kind of beyond my pay grade. But, but, but, but, but I think

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:44.540
you're absolutely right is that what evolution does is it builds machines that couple to these

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:50.860
amazing affordances, right? So, so, so, so when, you know, in the behavioral ecology, they would

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:56.940
call these affordances, these incredible affordances provided by physics, by computation, by geometry,

01:06:56.940 --> 01:07:01.900
by mechanics, you know, who knows what else is out there. Yeah, I think, I think that's,

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:07.260
that's, that's really an important way to look at evolution. Oh, that's, yeah. Daniel, yes.

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:15.100
I can't hold myself any longer. But first of all, this is an amazing talk. I wish we could

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:19.740
now sit together and talk for the rest of the afternoon, which neither you nor I can do. But

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:27.660
that we should definitely continue talking. And one thing that I, I find we, I could, first

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:33.660
of all, completely agree with this point about the triangle. So I just recently said to somebody

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:39.100
that mathematics is neither discovered, nor constructed, but it's something in between.

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:45.260
Right. And basically, you construct some things and then there are constraints that emerge and

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:50.700
they are implicit to whatever you do. It's a bit like what I call a box of oranges,

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.940
you fill the box of oranges and you get these hexagonal patterns once you're dense enough.

01:07:54.940 --> 01:08:01.660
And this is not something you created. It's a aspect of the space that forces this upon us.

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:06.380
But we still have choices between different crystal patterns, for example, in the dimensions,

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:11.980
for example, there are 14 crystal patterns. What I was wondering, I mean, to me, it looks like

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:18.700
there's an element of holography in the whole thing. So where information is not fully localized.

01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:24.060
And I felt that's the most strong reaction in your example with the brain, with double,

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:34.300
reconstructed brain. Because the question is how much information can you retain holographically?

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:39.820
So when you take this plan on one, and I think there wasn't even the experiment where even mice,

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:45.980
I think mice got. The question is, well, how much information can you retain when my language,

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:51.500
I would say, how many bits can you retain in this delocalized form?

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:59.180
Yeah, that's a great point. I have no idea how much information. We can't do the bits thing

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:03.340
because we don't know what the encoding and decoding of the message is. So that's hard.

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:08.540
But you're absolutely right. There's holography here in two ways. One is the sort of lateral way,

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:13.340
which is that, yeah, most of this information is distributed spatially across the whole animal.

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:19.020
So the bioelectric code and what enables us to do these various things is not a single cell

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:24.220
code. This is not something that tells individual cells what cell type they should be. This is

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:30.140
spread across the whole tissue. And of course, you can cut it both spatially and behaviorally.

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:36.540
It rescales the information onto every piece retains it. So that's kind of lateral holography.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:40.860
There's also a vertical one, which is interesting in a very important sense.

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:46.860
A lot of the same rules that operate in controlling the morphology of large scale

01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:57.500
bodies, like ours, some of those same rules are playing out in the shaping of single cells.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:04.380
So there are weird kind of mathematical aspects of morphology that work the same way

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:11.420
in multicellular bodies, but also in single cells that are completely low at a much lower scale.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:14.940
And other people have found the same thing in patterning of ant colonies and so on.

01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:23.100
So there's also this kind of almost a fractal kind of idea that the same things repeat themselves

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:26.700
again and again at different scales, despite the fact that the material implementation is quite

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:34.620
different at that point. That's really very interesting because I do think that there might

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:44.460
be ways of actually quantifying that. And I very much like this attractor vision of genetic coding,

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:49.020
because we know that embodiment can change a lot. I mean, the talk that I give with you,

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:54.140
I think I mentioned that very, very primitive example of how you can totally change the amount

01:10:54.220 --> 01:11:01.820
of information you need to do something if you change embodiment. So it's really drastically

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:08.140
different than the big question is how much can you associate to the embodiment? How much can

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:14.300
you associate to, in your case, the genome? I see the Stavros question. So I just go silent.

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:17.500
We can discuss another time. So let Stavros go ahead. Sorry.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:27.820
Stavros? Yeah, I'll take the question with I apologize in about three minutes. I do have to run.

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:37.180
Yeah, sorry. Sorry to interrupt you, Daniel. Thanks for your talk. I'll be very quick. I've seen you

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:41.420
in other talks sort of talk about using the language of affect to kind of describe like,

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:47.340
you know, navigating this morphological spaces and kind of extending the concept of affect.

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:55.500
Beyond what it's usually used to describe these morphological spaces. Can you talk more on that?

01:11:56.300 --> 01:12:04.060
Yeah, I think that's a very long discussion. But the short version of it is that we have been

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:11.740
trying to map as many concepts in cognitive neuroscience as we can onto this, for example,

01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:19.180
navigating morphospace. So all kinds of issues that people normally attribute to. So, you know,

01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:26.620
goal seeking behavior, rewards, punishments, different different types of learning and memory,

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:32.780
different types of so affect all these kinds of things, perceptual by stability, visual illusions,

01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:37.500
all of these things can be mapped very, very nicely. And in fact, I have I have tables in

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.860
a couple of papers, which I'm happy to send, where it just goes side by side. And it shows

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:46.140
you exactly what the what the mapping is. And so there are mappings for, for affect and for many,

01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:49.020
you know, for many, many of these terms. And I'm not saying all of them are going to map,

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:53.820
but so far, it's the symmetry has worked, you know, kind of very nicely. So you can define

01:12:53.820 --> 01:13:02.220
these things in other spaces. So incredible. Thank you. Thank you so much. Drop me an email,

01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:08.940
and I'll send you I'll send you the paper where we go into this. Okay. So are there any more

01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:13.340
questions? I don't know if there's actually time for any more questions, but it's I wish there were,

01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:20.380
but it's, yeah. So take this opportunity once more to thank the speaker for a wonderful talk.
