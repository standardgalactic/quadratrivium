WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.720
Yeah, thanks so much for joining me. How are you doing?

00:02.360 --> 00:04.680
Awesome. And thank you very, very much for having me. I'm

00:04.680 --> 00:06.280
excited. This is going to be fun.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.960
Yeah, yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. Yeah, I want I

00:09.960 --> 00:12.160
want to shine the light on some of the younger people that are

00:12.160 --> 00:14.200
doing some amazing stuff. And I'm really excited about your

00:14.200 --> 00:14.760
work. So

00:15.440 --> 00:17.040
thank you. Yeah, me too.

00:18.160 --> 00:21.320
Cool. Yeah, so maybe maybe just, you know, introduce yourself

00:21.320 --> 00:23.800
where you are now. And we'll we'll go from there.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.880
Totally. So I am Ali Hansen and I'm in Raphael Usain Lab here at

00:28.880 --> 00:34.120
Columbia. And how did I don't know that it's time yet to go into

00:34.120 --> 00:36.480
a full background, but I'll just suffice it to say that I've

00:36.480 --> 00:41.000
completed my psychiatry residency. But my background was in

00:41.000 --> 00:47.600
sort of selling of developmental biology, and sort of jumped

00:47.600 --> 00:50.720
into the field of neuroscience and using Hydra as a model

00:50.720 --> 00:55.240
system to sort of study, let's say, to be able to see the whole

00:55.280 --> 00:59.200
nervous system at once. And from there, what really interested

00:59.200 --> 01:03.360
me is the role of spontaneous neural activity, neural activity

01:03.360 --> 01:06.760
that's going on when the animal is not behaving. So I'm now a

01:06.760 --> 01:10.960
postdoc finishing that and in the process of figuring out where

01:10.960 --> 01:12.840
I'll go next to start my own group.

01:14.280 --> 01:16.960
Yeah, yeah, why don't you maybe talk a little bit about your

01:16.960 --> 01:19.840
background and just kind of your journey as far back as makes

01:19.840 --> 01:21.240
sense of how you got here.

01:21.640 --> 01:27.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I mean, I think, I think maybe far, far

01:27.840 --> 01:32.800
back, I'll just broad overview of a person from Iowa thinking, I

01:32.800 --> 01:34.680
don't know, no one else is probably paying attention to

01:34.680 --> 01:37.920
basketball, but Caitlin Clark, it went to my high school and

01:37.920 --> 01:41.360
she's the newest phenom. And so I thought, I wrote on my thing,

01:41.360 --> 01:44.440
I was going to play basketball in the WNBA and then I never

01:44.440 --> 01:51.000
grew, but ended up playing basketball in college, and studied

01:51.000 --> 01:54.720
molecular biology, and ended up doing MD PhD program. And my

01:54.720 --> 01:58.240
PhD at that point was in, yeah, so cell and developmental

01:58.240 --> 02:00.560
biology and the molecular mechanisms of wind signaling, so

02:00.560 --> 02:05.640
very, very molecular. And so I got sort of trained in that,

02:05.680 --> 02:11.880
that belief system that molecules are king. And that sort of

02:11.880 --> 02:15.240
explains, you know, not only how cells work, but how

02:15.240 --> 02:19.600
development works. And so my thesis was on that sort of the

02:19.600 --> 02:21.880
molecular mechanisms of wind signaling and ubiquit relation

02:21.880 --> 02:25.280
and these kinds of things. But then luckily, someone clued me

02:25.280 --> 02:29.800
in to the physiology course at the MBL in Woods Hole, which sort

02:29.800 --> 02:33.280
of was like, Oh, there's a whole other way to do this, you can

02:33.280 --> 02:36.760
sort of really zoom out and interact with other people, and

02:36.800 --> 02:39.480
in many other different disciplines, right? So there I

02:39.480 --> 02:43.480
was with peer mathematicians, physicists, computational

02:44.560 --> 02:47.600
scientists and people who had no experience with biology and I

02:47.600 --> 02:50.240
was the biologist coming in. And so it was like this awesome

02:50.480 --> 02:54.440
thing, right? Where you go and you do two weeks with different

02:54.440 --> 02:56.040
scientists on different projects and get really

02:56.040 --> 03:00.000
exposed to totally different ways of thinking. And in that, I

03:00.000 --> 03:03.280
ended up with Goudon's Danizer, actually, as one of my mentors,

03:03.280 --> 03:05.840
and I did a two week course on modeling three proteins in the

03:05.840 --> 03:09.640
wind pathway. And I was like, Oh, wow, like you can really start

03:09.640 --> 03:13.080
learning something really counterintuitive, something that

03:13.080 --> 03:16.240
you wouldn't know by just saying, Hey, you're going to draw

03:16.800 --> 03:19.480
the cell signaling pathway in a two dimensional piece of paper

03:19.480 --> 03:21.400
and draw a bunch of arrows and that's understanding. I was

03:21.400 --> 03:24.000
like, Oh, shit, that doesn't actually explain anything, right?

03:24.160 --> 03:27.520
So yeah, that that was sort of my first worry. And then of

03:27.520 --> 03:30.480
course, the likes of like Mark Kirschner and Andrew Murray were

03:30.480 --> 03:33.240
on the chalkboard doing all kinds of these things. And it was

03:33.240 --> 03:35.760
like, Oh, there's a different way to do this to find the

03:35.760 --> 03:38.920
simplest system possible, and try to model as much of it as you

03:38.920 --> 03:41.880
can to gain some understanding. And of course, that was right

03:41.880 --> 03:44.880
the end my PhD. So I didn't have time to sort of implement that

03:44.880 --> 03:48.800
and then went back to do medical training. And then I took

03:48.800 --> 03:51.760
another foray, which I think is important to how I ended up

03:51.760 --> 03:56.640
doing this kind of resume right now, which is art. So I left

03:57.040 --> 04:00.000
in the middle of my MD PhD training to go study painting in

04:00.000 --> 04:04.320
Santa Fe, New Mexico, with an amazing person who is Tony

04:04.320 --> 04:07.600
Rider, and that totally changed sort of, this is going to sound

04:07.600 --> 04:14.480
nuts, but how I see and the way I think it sort of opened up my

04:14.480 --> 04:19.840
mind to like, how you approach reality with a fixed idea. And

04:19.840 --> 04:22.320
so I went in there and I'm like, Oh, I got to paint here was so

04:22.320 --> 04:24.280
it was it was classical realism. So you're trying to be

04:24.280 --> 04:27.440
portraiture and nude models drawing and painting. I didn't

04:27.440 --> 04:29.720
have any experience with this really at all, except for you

04:29.720 --> 04:34.920
know, childhood classes or something. And going in there

04:34.920 --> 04:38.640
just for an example of like, Oh, a shadow is dark, just black,

04:38.840 --> 04:42.040
or something is like, no, as long as you have this belief,

04:42.480 --> 04:45.560
you'll never paint a shadow as it actually is because there's

04:45.560 --> 04:48.360
no such thing as pure black in nature, or reality, right?

04:48.360 --> 04:50.640
There's always some amount of light, some amount of color,

04:50.640 --> 04:53.680
something. And I remember so Ted South Jacobs was Tony's

04:53.680 --> 04:56.640
teacher is a very similar sort of lineage in art and science,

04:57.400 --> 05:00.080
who wrote a whole book on the anatomy of human forms. Like if

05:00.080 --> 05:03.080
you paint a human eyeball that looks like an almond with a

05:03.080 --> 05:07.400
circle in it, you'll never ever paint an eyeball that is true to

05:07.400 --> 05:09.720
reality. So it's kind of like, Oh, all of these concepts that

05:09.760 --> 05:13.360
I'm laying on top of these things are not real. Like it can I

05:13.360 --> 05:16.400
get rid of those things? That was part of that exercise for two

05:16.400 --> 05:21.120
years of trying to like, unlearn all of the things I had been

05:21.120 --> 05:25.920
told about what a human, you know, is and the features of it in

05:25.920 --> 05:28.320
order to paint what it actually is. And at the same time, there

05:28.320 --> 05:33.480
was a upaya Zen Center was in the back yard of this place. So I

05:33.480 --> 05:37.080
learned Zen brain, which is about conscious complex adaptive

05:37.080 --> 05:39.320
systems and all of this kind of stuff. Also Santa Fe

05:39.360 --> 05:42.080
Institute was there. So I was just all over doing all this

05:42.080 --> 05:46.520
stuff and taking all kinds of classes around all of that. And

05:46.520 --> 05:49.720
ultimately sort of, you know, I was I was debating, do I go

05:49.720 --> 05:52.440
paint full time? Do I do a postdoc? And if I was going to

05:52.440 --> 05:55.120
just do a straight postdoc, I was going to do on the origin of

05:55.120 --> 05:59.240
multicellularity, right? Like, how do you go from one cell to a

05:59.240 --> 06:02.080
group of cells? That was what I was interested in. But then, you

06:02.080 --> 06:05.320
know, I got interested in like, I really want to help people in

06:05.320 --> 06:09.920
quotes. And I want to do that through sort of psychiatry. So

06:09.920 --> 06:12.520
it's our way to put all of that stuff together. And I was like,

06:12.520 --> 06:14.560
well, shit, now I'm going to have to switch fields and study

06:14.560 --> 06:19.400
neuroscience. Which I was like, that's not at the time, I'm

06:19.400 --> 06:21.680
sorry, any neuroscience is out there. But like, that's not

06:21.680 --> 06:25.000
science. That's not molecular. What is that? It's, it's a you're

06:25.000 --> 06:27.520
putting a human in fMRI skin, you're looking at blood flowing

06:27.520 --> 06:29.320
all around. You're not even looking at neural activity. It

06:29.320 --> 06:31.200
was like, this isn't understanding. This isn't

06:31.200 --> 06:34.120
mechanism. Because for me, mechanism, what's the amino

06:34.120 --> 06:37.520
acid on the protein? That that's a mechanism, right? That was the

06:37.520 --> 06:40.320
kind of thinking. But going to that Zen brain conference

06:40.320 --> 06:42.840
actually was was one of those things we're like, oh, some of

06:42.840 --> 06:45.840
these questions, you just can't reduce to an amino acid and a

06:45.840 --> 06:49.360
protein, like that that model that that way of thinking doesn't

06:49.520 --> 06:53.640
doesn't compute here. So there was a lot of, you know, things

06:53.640 --> 06:59.000
going all around. But then, yeah, deciding, okay, I'm going to

06:59.000 --> 07:01.840
pursue a residency in psychiatry and try to figure out what is

07:01.840 --> 07:03.800
neuroscience. And so like, you had to do all these interviews,

07:03.800 --> 07:06.360
and I was just essentially using the residency interview as a

07:06.360 --> 07:10.040
postdoc interview to say, who's doing neuroscience? Where? What

07:10.040 --> 07:13.200
are they up to? And what level of scalar people studying all of

07:13.200 --> 07:19.720
this? I was just trying to see the lay of the land. Yeah, and I

07:19.720 --> 07:23.000
remember, I think, actually, at one point, somehow got a hold of

07:23.000 --> 07:26.280
Sidney Brenner, when he was in the hospital in Singapore, and

07:26.280 --> 07:29.560
I was like, Hey, what level scale do you think we should be

07:29.560 --> 07:32.400
doing this? You know, studying the nervous system? And I'm

07:32.400 --> 07:34.720
pretty sure I can't even remember his answer, but it was like

07:34.720 --> 07:37.800
single cells, you could go down, you can go up and this kind of

07:37.800 --> 07:42.720
thing. And so that kind of question of, of where, how do

07:42.720 --> 07:46.560
you tackle this problem? And then I ended up reading Rafa's

07:46.560 --> 07:48.520
articles, George Church and Scientific American around that

07:48.520 --> 07:51.240
time of like, you know, using complex adaptive systems theory

07:51.240 --> 07:53.200
to study the brain, you need to see the whole thing. I'm like,

07:53.200 --> 07:59.320
Yes. So on that interview, I then talked to Rafa, and he had a

07:59.320 --> 08:02.000
hydra on the screen, and it was just one of those moments where

08:02.040 --> 08:06.840
I'm like, No way. This is amazing. This is this is exactly

08:06.840 --> 08:09.400
what I've been looking for, like all of my dreams coming true on

08:09.400 --> 08:14.040
the screen, like it's a simple system. You can see the whole

08:14.040 --> 08:17.480
thing, you know, I don't know. And it's like, it has a lot of

08:17.480 --> 08:19.920
it, you know, obviously, rich history and cell and developmental

08:19.920 --> 08:23.160
biology, evolution, like it was all together. And one thing

08:23.160 --> 08:27.520
I'm like, All right, that's what I'm gonna have to do. And,

08:27.920 --> 08:32.120
yeah, in early saw that there was this spontaneous neural

08:32.120 --> 08:34.920
activity in that animal. And I was like, What is this? Right?

08:34.920 --> 08:37.560
What is that? And that got me very curious about where else that

08:37.560 --> 08:39.640
was found, which leads to the human brain and all of these

08:39.640 --> 08:43.800
things and, and the self and all of that. So it sort of all was

08:43.800 --> 08:46.280
coming together. And then I was sort of, you know, seeing

08:46.280 --> 08:50.120
patients as a resident. And then had a little bit of research

08:50.120 --> 08:52.280
time. So I was like, really reading and thinking and looking

08:52.280 --> 08:56.680
and, and all of that. Yeah, and I mean, I'll just disclose to

08:56.680 --> 08:59.760
you that I'm a, I'm a Zen student. And so it was also a

08:59.760 --> 09:03.160
scientist of my own mind. So I've been, you know, exploring it

09:03.160 --> 09:10.080
from that angle. A lot. So first person point of view and third

09:10.080 --> 09:14.160
person with patience. And then, you know, the in quotes, third

09:14.160 --> 09:17.600
person objective view of the system too. So there's all of

09:17.600 --> 09:23.720
that at play all the time. So yeah, that's the longest version

09:23.720 --> 09:24.600
I can muster.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.320
Yeah, yes, very interesting. The art at the art angle, I think

09:29.320 --> 09:33.680
is also is also quite quite interesting. I do know, you know,

09:33.680 --> 09:36.600
I can't draw anything like that. But I do a bunch of photography

09:36.600 --> 09:39.600
and I agree with you that that watching the light and like

09:40.080 --> 09:42.640
trying to trying to capture what you actually see or what you

09:42.640 --> 09:47.600
think you see is an interesting component of it. Yeah. How do

09:47.600 --> 09:51.600
you, how do you think about I'm curious, since you have you have

09:51.600 --> 09:55.080
a background in molecular genetics and also now neuroscience?

09:56.040 --> 09:59.120
How do you think about the kinds of things that those systems

09:59.120 --> 10:02.160
are good at? Like how are how are molecular dynamics and the

10:02.160 --> 10:04.800
kinds of things you get out of those different from what you

10:04.800 --> 10:08.520
can get out of out of, you know, for example, electrophysiology,

10:08.520 --> 10:10.800
you know, in terms of the computations, the usage, like

10:10.800 --> 10:12.880
how are the how what's different about those systems?

10:13.880 --> 10:17.000
You mean like sort of at the cellular level versus the system

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
level or like the neural?

10:19.560 --> 10:22.040
I mean, I mean, if you were going to if you were going to

10:22.040 --> 10:26.000
build things and your options were gene regulatory networks

10:26.000 --> 10:30.400
and diffusion versus electrical networks and synaptic kinds of

10:30.400 --> 10:35.400
things, what are the different, you know, dynamics that you can

10:35.400 --> 10:37.520
expect to get out of those systems? How are they different

10:37.520 --> 10:38.080
functionally?

10:38.440 --> 10:43.760
Yes, great question. I mean, ultimately, this is what I sort

10:43.760 --> 10:48.120
of, I mean, this isn't any big idea or anything. It's just like

10:48.160 --> 10:55.120
one of them is slower, right? So like molecules diffusing limits

10:55.120 --> 11:00.280
you I think in space and time. Whereas electricity, right,

11:00.480 --> 11:05.320
allows speed and distance. So it just speeds up processes, right?

11:05.320 --> 11:07.440
So I don't think there's anything particularly special

11:07.440 --> 11:13.560
about neurons. I think you agree with that, right? They did. I

11:13.560 --> 11:16.440
don't know. And if we're talking about, let's say memory or

11:16.440 --> 11:18.720
computation, any of those things, those can be implemented in

11:18.720 --> 11:22.640
any, any material, right? There's nothing special about

11:22.640 --> 11:25.840
neurons, this can happen in those molecules, if you put them

11:25.840 --> 11:28.800
together in certain ways, and you maintain a pattern, right,

11:28.800 --> 11:31.080
that's relevant to the organism, that can be implemented in the

11:31.080 --> 11:37.080
molecules. But it just sort of limits, I would say, yeah, the

11:37.080 --> 11:40.760
space and time of that that molecules are on a shorter like

11:40.760 --> 11:47.160
length scale, obviously, and take longer to move and

11:47.160 --> 11:50.400
communicate, whereas you can send electricity much faster over

11:50.400 --> 11:56.080
a longer distance. So yeah, I don't know if that's answering

11:56.120 --> 12:00.240
what you're asking, but that's sort of how I think about it.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree. That's that's definitely, that's

12:03.600 --> 12:06.240
definitely an important, an important feature. You know,

12:06.240 --> 12:09.320
people people sometimes ask me like, what's what's magical

12:09.320 --> 12:11.280
about bio electricity, like what's different about

12:11.280 --> 12:14.520
electrical networks, that's harder, or maybe even even not

12:14.520 --> 12:18.200
doable in typical molecular, you know, the kinds of kinds of

12:18.200 --> 12:19.320
networks. Yeah.

12:19.600 --> 12:23.360
Right. And I mean, because I, what I mean, I'm just thinking of

12:23.360 --> 12:27.840
this, like, intuitively, at some point of like, you know, what

12:27.840 --> 12:30.840
do we as human beings use to communicate, we use electricity

12:30.840 --> 12:33.440
because it's the fastest thing, use the smallest thing in

12:33.440 --> 12:36.880
electron that can go the fastest, right? And that's how we

12:36.920 --> 12:40.840
connect globally via the internet and all of this. So of

12:40.840 --> 12:45.160
course, nature would be using the same thing. And I remember

12:45.160 --> 12:48.160
looking it's up at some point in one of your papers, right, of

12:48.160 --> 12:51.320
like, when you get a wound, the first thing that happens is

12:51.320 --> 12:53.800
electrical communication, and then the molecules. And then I

12:53.800 --> 12:56.320
was at some point thinking like, one of the things I did, I

12:56.320 --> 12:59.640
mean, shit, every day all day was running Jell-O-Lusher

12:59.640 --> 13:03.520
freezes in a lab, right? Yeah, you're generating an electric

13:03.520 --> 13:08.480
field to put your proteins where you want them. Why would it

13:08.480 --> 13:12.840
nature be doing that, right? Itself, organizing itself using

13:12.840 --> 13:16.000
electricity. So the molecules are sort of, you know, and as you

13:16.000 --> 13:20.480
know, it's both bottom off and top down. But that, you know,

13:20.480 --> 13:22.560
you're using electricity because it's the fastest way to

13:22.560 --> 13:25.960
communicate from head to tail, let's say, in this organism,

13:25.960 --> 13:29.400
some things up on this end, and then you bring the molecules

13:29.400 --> 13:35.680
over there. Yeah. So for me, it's about sort of, yeah, speed

13:35.680 --> 13:38.640
and distance. That's what I would say. Yeah.

13:39.200 --> 13:43.240
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, so what kind of what are you working on

13:43.240 --> 13:46.320
now, talk to, you know, talk about? Totally. Yeah. And I

13:46.320 --> 13:51.320
mean, I don't know, I have a few slides I could go up, bring up

13:51.320 --> 14:04.480
here. Yeah. If you can see, I can't see that. Right. So this

14:04.480 --> 14:07.800
isn't, we don't really have to do a formal formal thing, but

14:07.920 --> 14:11.440
don't do as much as you want. Yeah, this is sort of the gist of

14:11.440 --> 14:15.040
it, right? As I've alluded to is what is going on with this

14:15.040 --> 14:19.960
spontaneous neural activity. And this would be an outline of

14:19.960 --> 14:22.480
like sort of why somebody like me, mostly interested in

14:22.480 --> 14:25.520
studying something like the human brain is some interested

14:25.520 --> 14:28.880
in studying as something as simple as this hydra. And then

14:28.920 --> 14:31.120
sort of that brings us into some kind of history of the

14:31.120 --> 14:34.440
spontaneous neural activity, what it might be doing, the tools

14:34.440 --> 14:37.360
needed to study that hydra and some of these future directions.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.520
And so I don't know how much we have time for, but I'll just

14:39.560 --> 14:44.440
kind of go as quickly as possible. And this is one of my

14:44.440 --> 14:47.520
favorite things to start with to say, like, just imagine that

14:47.520 --> 14:50.040
you're a scientist, and you're the first person to ever see an

14:50.040 --> 14:53.000
image that looks like this, which is exactly what happened to

14:53.000 --> 14:55.760
Golgi when he put the Golgi sound neural, like a nervous system

14:55.760 --> 14:57.840
for the first time, and you're trying to make sense of what is

14:57.840 --> 15:03.080
this. And he thought that this is just one giant reticular

15:03.080 --> 15:06.080
mesh work. It's all one thing. And other people at this time

15:06.080 --> 15:08.840
looked at basically the same image and saw something else. And

15:08.840 --> 15:11.800
they zoomed in on these little shapes here would look like

15:11.800 --> 15:14.560
these little pyramidal things. So Sherrington and Ramonica Hall

15:14.560 --> 15:17.000
say, Oh, what about these little pyramidal things? Like, what

15:17.120 --> 15:19.440
those are how this works? What are those are the functional

15:19.440 --> 15:21.160
units of this system?

15:21.320 --> 15:25.400
By the way, sorry, could I ask the Golgi stain? Was that random?

15:25.400 --> 15:27.920
Was he just trying random chemicals? Or did he have some

15:27.920 --> 15:30.080
idea that that was going to stain something interesting?

15:30.360 --> 15:32.720
I have no idea. Honestly, I would have to look that's a great

15:32.720 --> 15:36.000
question that he like why how that ended up happening. But

15:36.000 --> 15:40.080
before that, like, there was no ability to sort of see what it

15:40.080 --> 15:42.560
looked like. So there was all kinds of speculations, I think

15:42.560 --> 15:45.880
on behavior and all of that, but no real way to see or

15:45.880 --> 15:50.840
visualize the nervous system. And then what you do, then you've

15:50.840 --> 15:53.080
got to make sense of it, right? I think like, this is just a

15:53.080 --> 15:55.840
fundamental thing about science. It's like, first of all, the

15:55.840 --> 15:58.080
method that you use to view the thing will determine what you

15:58.080 --> 16:01.840
see. And this is exactly what happens in Neil Thies. We'll

16:01.840 --> 16:05.320
talk about this. And so this was happening at the same time as

16:07.600 --> 16:10.360
you know, cell theory with Schleiden Schwann, because at

16:10.360 --> 16:13.840
that time, they see cell boundaries, they see lipid

16:13.840 --> 16:16.600
membranes. And so they're like, Oh, what the functional unit of

16:16.600 --> 16:20.880
that system of non neural tissues is cells. But Neil will make

16:20.880 --> 16:24.000
the point, if you had just had a nuclear stain, what you would

16:24.000 --> 16:27.840
have seen is just a bunch of dots floating in liquid, you

16:27.840 --> 16:29.280
wouldn't have known that there were these things called

16:29.280 --> 16:32.600
membranes as you had sort of an Eastern conception of what's the

16:32.600 --> 16:36.280
functional unit of tissue, right? It would be like, Oh, it's

16:36.280 --> 16:39.680
fluid with a bunch of dots floating in it. So here, you

16:39.680 --> 16:42.820
have this at the beginning, right, like this whole picture of a

16:42.820 --> 16:47.860
nervous system. And then you're arbitrarily deciding which

16:47.860 --> 16:52.420
parts are separate from the rest. And so the decision at that

16:52.420 --> 16:55.380
point was sort of, we're going to go with cell theory, and the

16:55.380 --> 16:57.900
neuron doctrine that these little pyramidal shaped things are

16:57.900 --> 17:02.660
the units. And at the same time, Sherrington was going nuts on

17:02.700 --> 17:08.700
in reflex arcs. So that sort of solidified this idea that the

17:08.740 --> 17:11.340
not only the structural unit might be a single neuron, but

17:11.340 --> 17:13.740
the functional one, because you hit your knee, you get one

17:13.740 --> 17:16.780
sensory neuron that goes in synapses on another motor neuron

17:16.780 --> 17:19.940
your spinal cord, and that's your reflex, right? So that sort

17:19.940 --> 17:23.940
of gave them two ideas. A, that single neurons are the

17:23.940 --> 17:26.060
functional units. And that B, the nervous system is doing

17:26.060 --> 17:28.940
nothing unless you stimulate it from the outside. So those are

17:28.940 --> 17:33.940
just these two sort of major paradigms taken from mostly

17:33.940 --> 17:36.980
spinal cord peripheral nervous system is sort of applied to the

17:36.980 --> 17:42.140
cortex. And that must be how it works. But I would argue that

17:42.140 --> 17:45.700
those two major ideas have left us in a situation where you

17:45.700 --> 17:49.700
still don't really know the true functional unit, at least of

17:49.700 --> 17:54.460
cortex or non spinal cord peripheral nervous systems

17:54.580 --> 17:58.460
really are. Is it multiple neurons? Is it all one thing? Is

17:58.460 --> 18:01.540
it some amount of, let's say, ensemble, how many neurons are

18:01.540 --> 18:04.700
in ensemble? How do those things interact to generate

18:04.740 --> 18:08.060
complex cognitive states? And how do those go awry in

18:08.060 --> 18:09.340
neuropsychiatric disorders?

18:09.740 --> 18:13.380
Do you think that? Do you think there's a single objective

18:13.380 --> 18:16.420
answer to that question? Like, is there a, you know, the the

18:16.420 --> 18:20.660
optimal subunit or is that where do you think it's more of a

18:20.860 --> 18:22.820
observer dependent kind of, you know,

18:23.220 --> 18:27.420
Oh my God, yes, we got to skip his head till like 20 slides

18:27.420 --> 18:27.900
from now. But

18:28.340 --> 18:29.660
no problem. Keep keep keep going.

18:29.660 --> 18:32.660
Totally. And yeah, and I think I think it's I think there's

18:32.780 --> 18:35.660
again, what I'm most interested in, which I think most people

18:35.660 --> 18:38.140
are, are general principles. And I think this is going to be,

18:38.260 --> 18:40.500
there'll be general principles in that there's not one answer of

18:40.500 --> 18:42.860
like, what a functional unit is in a particular system, but the

18:42.860 --> 18:47.940
general way that that works, I think will probably be general.

18:50.260 --> 18:52.980
And so yeah, I don't need to introduce a complex adaptive

18:52.980 --> 18:58.020
system to you, but maybe other people, if anyone ever sees

18:58.020 --> 19:02.260
this would be interested. So basically, it's just you have a

19:02.260 --> 19:05.980
bunch of individual simple systems or subunits, right at this

19:05.980 --> 19:10.300
level of scale. And I should just say that why am I talking about

19:10.300 --> 19:12.940
that? I'm saying because if the brain is actually this complex

19:12.940 --> 19:16.340
adaptive system, maybe we're studying at the wrong level of

19:16.340 --> 19:18.420
scale, we can't see the functional units because we're

19:18.420 --> 19:21.900
studying one thing at a time. So this is a bunch of units,

19:21.900 --> 19:23.580
right, these can be anything, these can be electrons in the

19:23.580 --> 19:26.020
magnet, water molecules and water, ants and ant colony birds

19:26.020 --> 19:28.660
and flock or neurons in a nervous system. The key is you put

19:28.660 --> 19:31.100
enough of them together and they follow simple rules. And if we

19:31.100 --> 19:34.060
just think of this as an electron simplest example, you

19:34.060 --> 19:36.220
have an electron that spin up and its neighbors spin down and

19:36.220 --> 19:38.860
it needs to become a spin down. And you put enough of them

19:38.860 --> 19:40.980
together and critically that won't happen with one electron or

19:40.980 --> 19:43.940
10 electrons and it's a property of many electrons, you get this

19:43.980 --> 19:46.140
emergent phenomenon of the higher level scale. In this case,

19:46.140 --> 19:49.380
it'd be like magnetism, right? And then that higher level scale

19:49.380 --> 19:53.260
can feedback down and coordinate and constrain the lower lower

19:53.260 --> 19:56.180
level. And the key here right is that you you're never going to

19:56.180 --> 19:59.300
see magnetism if you're looking at this level here at this

19:59.300 --> 20:02.660
single electron, you're only going to see it up here if

20:02.660 --> 20:05.020
you're looking at a higher level of scale. And that level of

20:05.020 --> 20:07.540
scale also is going to be following sort of totally

20:07.540 --> 20:10.900
different rules than this level of scale. So if that's what

20:10.900 --> 20:13.020
we're trying to do in neuroscience in general, we

20:13.020 --> 20:17.500
think of this as a TV screen. Like, you know, for the most of

20:17.500 --> 20:19.180
the history of neuroscience, we've been doing these single

20:19.180 --> 20:21.900
pixels at a time, you know, single unit electrophysiology,

20:21.900 --> 20:24.860
which of course is critical, we need to do that, we had to

20:24.860 --> 20:28.140
understand what a neuron is, and doing that one at a time, but

20:28.140 --> 20:31.660
you can't really see the whole picture at once. Alternatively,

20:31.740 --> 20:36.340
you can zoom out and do things like I was saying MRI, EEG, MEG,

20:36.340 --> 20:39.180
these kinds of things, you get a global view, but it's very low

20:39.180 --> 20:41.500
spatial temporal resolution. So you can sort of tell that

20:41.500 --> 20:44.100
something's happening. But it's hard to sort of see what that

20:44.100 --> 20:47.660
is. So the ultimate goal then, right, is to just look at that

20:47.660 --> 20:51.380
TV screen with single pixel resolution to sort of see, okay,

20:51.500 --> 20:53.660
now that we can see all these individual neurons, what picture

20:53.660 --> 20:56.220
is emerging at this higher level scale, what can we see by just

20:56.220 --> 21:00.420
looking at it, right? And again, I'm interested in this big

21:00.420 --> 21:03.420
thing here, the human brain, given that I'm interested in the

21:03.420 --> 21:07.180
human mind and helping these kinds of folks. But it's huge,

21:07.180 --> 21:10.100
it's 86 billion neurons with trillions of connections, it's

21:10.100 --> 21:12.300
not going to fit under the microscope and all of that. So

21:12.300 --> 21:15.500
you can simplify that problem, you can do it in a mouse brain,

21:15.620 --> 21:17.260
right? But even here, how are you going to get all this

21:17.260 --> 21:19.700
hardware in here, record all those neurons, and even if you

21:19.700 --> 21:23.060
do that optically, if I don't know, right now, we're up to,

21:23.060 --> 21:26.300
let's say, let's be generous, I think I'm really arresting by

21:26.300 --> 21:30.380
saying 20,000 neurons, that's out of 71 million. So it's just

21:30.380 --> 21:35.460
really not much of the whole TV screen, let's say. So you could

21:35.460 --> 21:39.260
simplify this even further. And you can do zebrafish, right?

21:39.300 --> 21:41.980
And Drosophila and even CL again, but even these systems are

21:41.980 --> 21:45.380
still quite complex. Depending on the, you know, developed stage

21:45.380 --> 21:47.900
of the zebrafish, you can have up to 10 million neurons still

21:47.900 --> 21:51.100
and lots of different cell types, and they're all, I think,

21:51.220 --> 21:54.980
importantly, sort of shoved together in these complex brains

21:54.980 --> 21:58.700
and ganglia that are also sort of hard to disentangle. So

21:58.700 --> 22:03.580
Sidney Brenner sat down with my mentor, Rafa, who we all know,

22:03.580 --> 22:08.060
Sidney was the one who pioneered the work on C. elegans. And he

22:08.060 --> 22:11.020
said, that's even still too complicated, right? What if we

22:11.020 --> 22:13.900
try something even simpler? Let's do Hydra, which has 200 to

22:13.900 --> 22:16.260
2000 neurons, depending on the size of the animal. And

22:16.380 --> 22:19.460
depending on how you cut off the cell sequencing, single cell

22:19.460 --> 22:23.060
sequencing data, you get 11 to 12, maybe 13 different neural

22:23.060 --> 22:27.580
cell types. And it doesn't have a true brain or ganglia as you'll

22:27.580 --> 22:33.860
see momentarily. I gotta get that off there. Okay, I say. Right.

22:33.860 --> 22:38.220
So then it also not only is it simple, but it's an interesting

22:38.220 --> 22:40.620
position on the evolutionary tree, at least as far as I'm

22:40.620 --> 22:45.820
concerned, it's right after and quotes the non neural lineage,

22:45.820 --> 22:48.380
and then right before the bilaterians, which is the branch

22:48.380 --> 22:52.740
of life that we're sort of used to studying. And neuroscience,

22:52.820 --> 22:54.940
where you have a central midline structure structure and a

22:54.940 --> 22:58.940
left and a right side. Whereas the Nigerians are sort of

22:58.940 --> 23:01.300
totally radially symmetric, they don't have any of those

23:01.300 --> 23:04.700
things. So it's it's another instance where you can sort of

23:04.700 --> 23:07.100
say, Hey, what are these general principles? This nervous

23:07.100 --> 23:10.220
system looks nothing like that one. And yet it's able to

23:10.220 --> 23:14.100
generate complex behavior. Does it matter what the

23:14.100 --> 23:17.180
architecture of this nervous system is? Because it's

23:17.180 --> 23:20.100
seemingly, right? Everyone's very interested and obsessed with

23:20.100 --> 23:23.660
getting those the circuit diagrams, right? But does that

23:23.660 --> 23:25.820
matter? Can you get complete essentially the same

23:25.820 --> 23:30.700
functionality out of completely different architectures? And I

23:30.700 --> 23:36.500
think that's probably what we'll find if we look. How do I go

23:36.500 --> 23:40.100
forward? Oh, there we go. So, so this is just what an actual

23:40.100 --> 23:43.620
hydra looks like with its mouth, tentacles, foot, and then this

23:43.620 --> 23:47.820
hydra buds. So this is going to be important in a second,

23:47.820 --> 23:51.700
because hydra can reproduce asexually. So hydra essentially

23:51.700 --> 23:54.860
just can clone itself with it. You keep feeding these animals

23:54.860 --> 23:58.340
instead of them just getting infinitely big or long. They

23:58.500 --> 24:02.020
start budding and reproducing and making a genetically

24:02.020 --> 24:06.900
identical copy, right? I think it's critical for you. And then

24:06.900 --> 24:11.060
they can also reproduce sexually too. So the same

24:11.060 --> 24:16.660
animal can their stem cells can then generate testes or ovaries

24:17.340 --> 24:23.220
or an egg here and reproduce sexually. So either way. And

24:23.220 --> 24:29.140
then right, so again, it has essentially not exactly the same

24:29.140 --> 24:33.940
but 20,000 genes very similar to our genome, right? So the genes

24:33.940 --> 24:38.380
here are are essentially the same thing as your eye and yet

24:38.380 --> 24:41.860
it's building something completely different. And then

24:41.860 --> 24:44.540
it's small so it can be anywhere from 500 or one, one and a

24:44.540 --> 24:46.540
half centimeters. And I'm currently sort of figuring out

24:46.540 --> 24:51.100
what's the smallest one we can get to to make so that we can fit

24:51.100 --> 24:54.700
that really under the field of view. Transparent, robust, you

24:54.700 --> 24:57.220
can do all kinds of things to this thing. And then

24:57.260 --> 24:59.300
interestingly also is that it completely regenerates its

24:59.300 --> 25:02.620
nervous system every 20 days. So it's constantly making this

25:02.620 --> 25:09.260
nervous system and maintaining itself somehow. Right. A lot

25:09.260 --> 25:11.420
of molecular tools being developed. And then it has

25:11.420 --> 25:14.660
these well-defined behaviors. So these are just so it's

25:14.660 --> 25:18.020
resting, right? Just laying there doing nothing. And then

25:18.020 --> 25:20.700
can just do a very simple longitudinal contraction where

25:20.700 --> 25:23.340
it goes from long to short. And then the opposite of that is

25:23.340 --> 25:27.060
elongation. So it goes from short to long. And then it has

25:27.060 --> 25:29.660
complex behaviors. I mean, these are arbitrary words I'm

25:29.660 --> 25:32.420
defining. I'm just saying these are more complex. And this one

25:32.420 --> 25:36.060
is eating. So in lab, you feed hydra, artemianopoly, just

25:36.060 --> 25:39.380
brine shrimp. And this is just glutathione, reduced glutathione

25:39.380 --> 25:42.180
will also have them do this feeding response. So they'll

25:42.180 --> 25:45.460
rip open. So they'll use their tentacles to capture shrimp,

25:45.900 --> 25:48.980
rip open, rip open in their mouth and shove a bunch of them

25:48.980 --> 25:53.340
inside of their body. And then the most complex, I would say is

25:53.340 --> 25:56.500
somersalting. So it will reach out, stick its head and

25:56.500 --> 26:00.180
tentacles down, contract, release its foot, flip over, and

26:00.180 --> 26:02.260
then put its foot back down. So in this way, it can sort of

26:02.300 --> 26:05.660
in quotes, walk. So it can do all of this with a very, very

26:05.660 --> 26:09.460
simple nervous system. And so this is just some quick, yep.

26:09.580 --> 26:13.020
Sorry, sorry, could I just ask on the on the behavior side? Does

26:13.020 --> 26:19.140
anybody do? Has anybody checked various learning training? Can

26:19.140 --> 26:20.540
you teach these things anything?

26:20.780 --> 26:25.580
Right. So this is this is the new frontier. But there it's also

26:25.580 --> 26:30.020
the new old frontier. So as is all science, that that there were

26:30.060 --> 26:33.540
some old studies, I think some of the first was 1900 and then

26:33.540 --> 26:41.060
1950 of habituation in Hydra. So if you just sort of if you

26:41.060 --> 26:43.740
pinch them, or even stick an electrode in them, they'll

26:43.740 --> 26:47.740
contract. And if if you keep doing that over and over again,

26:47.740 --> 26:51.060
with it with the proper inter stimulus interval, they'll

26:51.060 --> 26:56.060
stop, they'll habituate. But that hasn't there hasn't been like,

26:56.580 --> 27:01.460
in the last, I don't know, 50 years, any of that has not been

27:01.460 --> 27:06.260
repeated. And and I don't think it's because people have tried

27:06.260 --> 27:09.220
and failed. I think most people haven't really revisited that.

27:10.580 --> 27:18.300
But yeah, that's, that's on the docket. Yeah, and, and I mean,

27:18.300 --> 27:21.660
there's so I guess, was I think it was nematostellas showing

27:21.660 --> 27:24.340
associative learning there. So other Nigerians now have been

27:24.340 --> 27:29.220
shown to be doing, you know, more complex things than meet the

27:29.220 --> 27:36.340
eye. Right. So you get this hypostome. This is just a cartoon

27:36.340 --> 27:40.020
of the same thing, this nerve net, the tentacles. This is where

27:40.020 --> 27:42.700
they would have the buds coming off. This is the basal disc. And

27:42.700 --> 27:46.340
this is the tissue. So it's a just two layers. It's not a true

27:46.340 --> 27:49.020
three layer thing. There's no true mesoderm. There's just the

27:49.020 --> 27:52.060
endoderm on the inside and the extra term on the outside. And

27:52.100 --> 27:56.220
it's thought that all of these, these are also myo epithelial

27:56.220 --> 27:59.780
cells, they're epithelial cells with, let's just go over there

27:59.780 --> 28:03.100
like muscle processes at the bottom. So they're sort of a

28:03.100 --> 28:05.740
dual cell type. And then it's thought that all of those are

28:05.740 --> 28:09.620
connected by gap junctions. And then you have your nerve net in

28:09.620 --> 28:12.940
the endoderm with sensory neurons poking into the inside of

28:12.940 --> 28:16.020
the gut, and then ganglion neurons in the ectoderm with

28:16.020 --> 28:18.860
sensory neurons poking out to the outside environment. And it's

28:18.860 --> 28:21.500
thought that these do not communicate. But I think that

28:21.500 --> 28:25.780
might not be accurate. But that's the current idea. And then

28:26.180 --> 28:28.420
these three different cell types, you have eye cells, which are

28:28.420 --> 28:31.300
the stem cells that make the germ cells, the gland cells,

28:31.300 --> 28:36.060
nomadicides, which are specific to, to Nigeria are super cool cell

28:36.060 --> 28:40.380
type that shoot out darts, like with toxins, essentially, and

28:40.380 --> 28:45.940
then neurons. And then these all cell-free new. So the eye cells

28:45.940 --> 28:48.140
make these four and the ectoderm and endoderm cell-free

28:48.140 --> 28:52.180
new themselves also. So that's sort of just the gist of that.

28:52.180 --> 28:54.860
And then this is the current view of sort of the connectome, if

28:54.860 --> 28:59.300
you will, of Hydra. So this is from Charlie David at LMU using

28:59.300 --> 29:03.020
anti-kid heron antibody that they've just shown sort of stains

29:03.020 --> 29:06.020
all of the neurons in the animal. And it looks, you know,

29:06.020 --> 29:09.060
like, again, this could just diffuse nerve net. And in the

29:09.060 --> 29:13.820
ectoderm, it's sort of this north-south highway where you

29:13.820 --> 29:18.100
have more of a bipolar neuron. And in the endoderm, it's a

29:18.140 --> 29:20.620
more multipolar thing that's sort of going more radially

29:20.620 --> 29:23.820
around the animal. And then again, this is from Rob Steele at

29:23.820 --> 29:28.660
Irvine, where this is just GFP expressed in eye cells. And you

29:28.660 --> 29:31.420
can see that there appears to be a little bit of a condensation

29:31.420 --> 29:34.580
of neurons in the, in the foot and in the head. And again, I

29:34.580 --> 29:37.580
think this is another thing to keep in mind that what we're

29:37.580 --> 29:40.580
seeing is depending on the tool that we're using to look at this

29:40.580 --> 29:45.020
thing. So which is true. Yes, they're both true. But when you

29:45.020 --> 29:48.340
look at that, it's unclear, like how that there's no obvious

29:48.340 --> 29:52.260
circuitry, there's no anything that you say that would really

29:52.260 --> 29:54.980
tell you just looking at that structure, how that's going to

29:54.980 --> 29:57.780
function. Is it functioning as one thing as many things who

29:57.780 --> 30:03.060
knows, until Christoph put in G camp six. So this is a molecule

30:03.060 --> 30:07.420
that will fluoresce every time the neuron fires. And you, he

30:07.420 --> 30:10.140
made a transgenic animal expressing this in the eye

30:10.140 --> 30:14.180
cells. So all of the neurons had G camp six expressed, he then

30:14.220 --> 30:17.420
put the hydra in between two cover slips. So this is just a

30:17.420 --> 30:20.620
hundred micron spacer, it's swimming around in hydra media,

30:20.620 --> 30:22.940
so it can still behave in two dimensions. And then just put

30:22.940 --> 30:26.940
this on a normal white field microscope, and came up with a

30:26.940 --> 30:30.860
movie that looks like this. So it's sort of, you know, this

30:31.100 --> 30:33.500
can you see all the pixels in the movie at the same time. And

30:33.500 --> 30:37.380
when you do, what do you see? Are they all firing completely

30:37.380 --> 30:41.140
independently, total chaos? No, and are they all firing as one

30:41.140 --> 30:44.020
thing? No, it's, it's something else. And in order to figure

30:44.020 --> 30:47.260
out what the something else was, Christoph had to painstakingly

30:47.460 --> 30:51.660
circle every one of those neurons and track it over time to

30:51.660 --> 30:55.940
analyze that data and figure out what, what is happening here

30:55.940 --> 30:59.020
and came up with this sort of general model, and saying that

30:59.020 --> 31:01.860
out of that seemingly simple nerve net, you have these three

31:01.860 --> 31:05.340
independent sort of units, ensembles or circuits, however

31:05.340 --> 31:08.220
you want to call that groups of neurons that are co firing

31:08.220 --> 31:13.180
together. And the one that's most consistently associated with

31:13.220 --> 31:16.940
muscle activity is CB, where every time it fires, you get a

31:16.940 --> 31:19.500
longitudinal contraction. So it gets shorter. That's very, very

31:19.500 --> 31:22.700
clear that that's motor. These other two are less clear rhythm

31:22.700 --> 31:25.220
potential one and rhythm potential two. But the potential

31:25.220 --> 31:28.900
two in that early paper was most associated with radial

31:28.900 --> 31:31.700
contraction. So that's in the end of the animal, when that

31:31.700 --> 31:34.780
fires, it gets skinnier and can do some ingestion. So it will

31:34.780 --> 31:38.060
spit its food out or water, let's say from its mouth. And then

31:38.060 --> 31:42.780
rhythm potential one is in the ectoderm. And when it fires in

31:42.780 --> 31:47.940
that paper was correlated with elongation toward light. But

31:47.940 --> 31:50.340
what was most interesting to me was that this was also

31:50.340 --> 31:52.940
happening when the when the animals just sitting there

31:52.940 --> 31:57.340
doing nothing, just there. And that again, is not new. We're

31:57.340 --> 32:01.820
noticing a thing. Reading literature is helpful. So that

32:02.420 --> 32:04.940
this was found in the 60s by Pisano and McCullough, where

32:04.940 --> 32:07.140
they were just sticking an electrode into Hydra. And they

32:07.140 --> 32:11.860
found the same thing that there was this rhythmic, you know,

32:11.860 --> 32:15.340
firing of some kind of neural network in the animal, they

32:15.340 --> 32:17.900
didn't have access to, they just knew that this was happening

32:18.060 --> 32:20.700
with their electrode when the animals doing nothing. And they

32:20.700 --> 32:23.300
were called this cryptic activity, they said, What the

32:23.300 --> 32:26.260
hell is this doing? Right? Because again, at the time, the

32:26.260 --> 32:28.780
idea is that the nervous system is there to generate

32:28.780 --> 32:33.500
behavior. Otherwise, it's off. Why at the base of the Tree of

32:33.500 --> 32:36.100
Life, the simplest nervous system, are we seeing all kinds of

32:36.100 --> 32:39.660
activity going on? If it's not generating behavior? And so

32:39.700 --> 32:42.660
he hypothesized in one of his early papers, that is this

32:42.660 --> 32:46.260
thing, coordinating the nervous system, sort of the

32:46.260 --> 32:48.580
quarterback of the thing, the conductor, whatever metaphor you

32:48.580 --> 32:52.420
want to use. And I've been told that he went off and started

32:52.420 --> 32:56.020
selling bikes. And so never finished that work. And so we

32:56.020 --> 32:59.740
don't know. But it was discovered there, right with

32:59.740 --> 33:02.100
an electrode, and it was discovered rediscovered, let's

33:02.100 --> 33:05.340
say with calcium. So it's method independent that you find the

33:05.340 --> 33:09.060
same sort of thing. And that is what got me interested and

33:09.060 --> 33:11.620
brings us to this very brief history of what we know about

33:11.620 --> 33:14.580
simultaneous neural activity, which is very little. Because as

33:14.580 --> 33:17.460
I was saying, Sherrington at that time, the big mantra was

33:17.460 --> 33:21.220
reflexive brain, it's doing nothing. Otherwise, but his

33:21.220 --> 33:24.780
own student actually was finding something very different

33:24.780 --> 33:28.260
than that. And he sort of, he cut the head off of a cat and

33:28.500 --> 33:32.820
deafferented the cat, no sensory input whatsoever, zero input to

33:32.820 --> 33:37.020
a nervous system, he had all kinds of activity going on to

33:37.060 --> 33:39.860
the point where the cat could still walk. So this was clearly

33:39.860 --> 33:42.420
internally generated neural activity had nothing to do with

33:42.420 --> 33:45.420
outside input. But that was just ignored. I was like, whatever,

33:45.420 --> 33:50.500
that guy's nuts. Whatever he's up to, let him do that. And then

33:50.540 --> 33:52.700
at the same time, or around the same time, Hans Berger was

33:52.700 --> 33:57.500
inventing the EEG, EEG, we have humans. I'm just sitting in a

33:57.500 --> 34:00.700
chair, all kinds of electrical activity going on there as well.

34:00.980 --> 34:04.020
And like I was saying, so it wasn't just Poisson and McCulloch

34:04.020 --> 34:06.100
discovering this spontaneous activity in hydra, it was sort

34:06.140 --> 34:08.860
of anybody looking at any Nigeria, we're sort of discovering

34:08.860 --> 34:12.140
this kind of thing going on. But of course, no one's talking to

34:12.140 --> 34:15.060
each other. And so no one knows. And so it wasn't, of course,

34:15.060 --> 34:19.940
until the 2000s when Raeckel and others at WashU put humans into

34:19.940 --> 34:25.740
fMRI scanners. And at the time, right, it's sort of what was

34:25.740 --> 34:29.300
interesting is the task evoked activity. Anything else that you

34:29.300 --> 34:31.740
couldn't explain was seen as noise, like white noise on the

34:31.740 --> 34:34.700
TV, get rid of it. What we're interested in is what happens to

34:34.700 --> 34:38.980
the brain when you go to do the task. But at some point, he was

34:38.980 --> 34:42.820
like, Hey, all of those areas in the brain that are active at

34:42.820 --> 34:46.660
rest seem to be specific. And they're specifically inhibited

34:46.660 --> 34:50.020
when the person is going to do the task. So he called up this

34:50.020 --> 34:54.180
default mode network, which became like, you know, a very hot

34:54.220 --> 34:57.940
topic, and has reignited interest in study of spontaneous

34:57.940 --> 35:02.460
neural activity, which we now know is one of the most highly

35:02.500 --> 35:05.660
conserved aspects of all brains. And so this is from

35:05.660 --> 35:09.220
Busacchi's review, and that spans a wide range of frequencies

35:09.220 --> 35:13.660
to 600 Hertz, very ultra pass all the way down to ultra slow of

35:13.660 --> 35:16.740
like the point one to point one Hertz. And this is something

35:16.740 --> 35:21.380
that's found in all mammalian brains, regardless of size or

35:21.380 --> 35:26.060
structure, you find this, right? And I think the current idea is

35:26.060 --> 35:28.860
that that's just noise, right? That's reverb, you have a

35:28.860 --> 35:32.100
complex enough electrical system, you're going to get

35:32.100 --> 35:34.780
oscillations, it's not functional, it's not relevant,

35:34.780 --> 35:38.340
it's an epiphenomenon of the system. It's not doing anything.

35:39.740 --> 35:43.980
And I think one of the reasons that that still is the idea is

35:43.980 --> 35:48.220
because you can't really image it or manipulate them in a

35:48.220 --> 35:51.660
specific way to determine if you if you manipulate this

35:51.700 --> 35:55.860
oscillation, in particular, does that do anything? Or what

35:55.860 --> 36:00.540
does it do? But again, it's taking 20% total body energy and

36:00.540 --> 36:02.980
one of the most highly conserved aspects of all brains that we've

36:02.980 --> 36:07.180
looked at. So the question is why or what is it doing? And

36:07.180 --> 36:09.980
again, one of the most highly studied is the default mode

36:09.980 --> 36:14.700
network in humans. And this is related to the self in theory.

36:14.700 --> 36:17.180
So it's most active at rest, it's going on all the time and its

36:17.180 --> 36:20.340
function continues to be debated. But it's thought to be

36:20.340 --> 36:23.140
involved when you're internally focused. So you're either

36:23.220 --> 36:26.900
remembering your past, thinking about yourself right now or

36:26.900 --> 36:30.380
contemplating your future. And the same sort of midline

36:30.380 --> 36:33.540
structures that I'll show you in a second appear to be

36:33.540 --> 36:39.300
activated when you're doing self related processing. So if I'm

36:39.300 --> 36:42.300
shown a picture of a stranger versus myself, the default mode

36:42.300 --> 36:44.460
network lights up when I'm looking at something related to

36:44.460 --> 36:47.500
the self. And that's in any modality, whether that's pictures,

36:47.500 --> 36:52.900
whether that's hearing my voice, those kinds of things. So and

36:52.900 --> 36:55.220
then also it's linked to a number of neuropsychiatric

36:55.220 --> 36:57.980
disorders. And so you can't throw like a dart at PubMed right

36:57.980 --> 37:01.420
now and not see the default mode network link to something. And

37:01.420 --> 37:05.420
the way I'm simplifying that is to say that the general idea

37:05.420 --> 37:09.900
seems to be that you have states like depression and anxiety

37:09.900 --> 37:12.100
when you're too internally focused, the default mode network

37:12.100 --> 37:14.620
is too active. This is associated with rumination and

37:14.620 --> 37:19.420
worry and depression and anxiety and vice versa. When in

37:19.420 --> 37:22.020
states like psychosis, psychedelic meditation, when

37:22.060 --> 37:25.020
you disrupt the default mode network, this leads to in quotes

37:25.020 --> 37:29.860
ego dissolution. So some of the best data that there are in human

37:29.860 --> 37:33.260
studies are when you put humans in and that they can self

37:33.260 --> 37:37.900
report, you know, on either psilocybin, LSD or DMT, that

37:37.900 --> 37:40.620
whatever they think they are sort of dissolved, and then you

37:40.620 --> 37:44.220
can see what happened in the MRI scanner. And that correlates

37:44.220 --> 37:48.260
with disruption of the default mode network. So the question is

37:48.260 --> 37:51.300
how how why or how would that have anything to do with the

37:51.300 --> 37:53.180
self? What would be the mechanism by which the

37:53.180 --> 37:55.100
development network could implement something like a

37:55.100 --> 37:59.620
self? And there's sort of, you know, the structural argument

37:59.620 --> 38:02.100
and the functional argument, the structural argument being that

38:02.100 --> 38:04.980
it's a central midline structure. So medial prefrontal

38:04.980 --> 38:09.060
cortex, the posterior cingulate, the medial temporal lobes, that

38:09.060 --> 38:12.740
these are sort of these major rich hubs in the brain that are

38:12.740 --> 38:16.460
connecting regions that would otherwise be segregated, right?

38:16.460 --> 38:19.340
So you can imagine if you had a brain where the visual cortex

38:19.340 --> 38:21.500
was not talking to the auditory cortex is not talking to the

38:21.500 --> 38:23.540
olfactory cortex, and it was not talking to the internal

38:23.540 --> 38:28.700
brainstem system, that you know, that would be a disintegrated

38:28.700 --> 38:32.220
system. So is this this sort of central midline superhighway

38:32.220 --> 38:35.700
with these thickly malignated axons connecting all of those

38:35.700 --> 38:38.740
brain areas sort of getting input from all of them and then

38:38.860 --> 38:43.740
maybe getting sending information back. So that's sort of

38:43.740 --> 38:47.420
the structural thing. And then the functional piece is that

38:47.420 --> 38:49.300
it's one of the lowest frequency oscillators in the brain of

38:49.300 --> 38:54.300
0.01 to 0.1 Hertz. And this is where we got to go real crazy.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.740
And this is now finally going to answer your question about the

38:56.740 --> 39:03.860
observers in the brain, which is so Buzaki was saying, right,

39:03.860 --> 39:08.820
like, this is what we've been doing as a neuroscientist is

39:08.820 --> 39:12.540
looking at things from a quote unquote, third party, third

39:12.540 --> 39:15.060
party objective view, you're looking at a brain with a bunch

39:15.060 --> 39:17.740
of squiggly activity, and then you're looking at its output,

39:17.740 --> 39:20.780
this behavior, and you're correlating those two things. And

39:20.780 --> 39:23.900
you can say, Okay, if I see this squiggly activity, then I

39:23.900 --> 39:26.860
can predict that the animal, whatever organism is going to

39:26.860 --> 39:30.060
do this behavior. And that's helpful for us. And that's very

39:30.060 --> 39:33.980
useful clinically, right, we could use that. But that's not

39:33.980 --> 39:37.700
understanding. That's not what the brain is doing. The brain has

39:37.700 --> 39:40.580
to observe itself, the neurons have to observe their own

39:40.580 --> 39:46.220
information, and then decide sort of in quotes, decide what what

39:46.220 --> 39:52.860
to do. So, right, so if you think of neuron A, B, and C

39:52.860 --> 39:56.380
here, neuron A has to sort of observe the upstream activity

39:56.780 --> 40:00.780
from its inputs neurons one, five, and nine. And in order to do

40:00.780 --> 40:02.980
that, it has to be integrating that information over a certain

40:02.980 --> 40:06.860
period of time. And let's just say that's 100 milliseconds. So

40:06.900 --> 40:12.420
it reads that information and decides and not decides whatever

40:12.420 --> 40:17.060
word you want to use, will fire or not, right? Based on that

40:17.100 --> 40:20.260
that upstream input and same thing with B and C. So you can

40:20.260 --> 40:22.860
think of those as sort of the highest frequency oscillators in

40:22.860 --> 40:27.300
the system, the letters, if you want, in the neural code. Then

40:27.340 --> 40:31.220
the downstream observer of A, B, and C is Q, let's say it has to

40:31.220 --> 40:34.420
read out the input from A, B, and C, and therefore has to be

40:34.420 --> 40:37.660
integrating that input over a longer period of time to give

40:37.660 --> 40:41.060
time to for A, B, and C to give it its input. So that would then

40:41.060 --> 40:44.380
say integrate over 200 milliseconds. So it then reads

40:44.380 --> 40:48.260
out A, B, and C. And so reading out, let's say, cab a neural

40:48.260 --> 40:52.820
word. So looking over here, that would be like this frequency.

40:53.060 --> 40:55.500
And so you could say you would go from letters to neural words,

40:55.620 --> 40:57.740
and then this is going to read over a longer time scale to get

40:57.740 --> 41:01.100
inputs from those to form sentences, and then paragraphs

41:01.100 --> 41:03.660
and all the way down. And so is it possible that you have this

41:03.660 --> 41:07.060
thing that's the lowest frequency oscillator, getting all of

41:07.060 --> 41:10.180
the input on the longest time scale in the entire nervous

41:10.180 --> 41:14.900
system to read all of that information out? And so this is

41:14.900 --> 41:19.180
just sort of a picture of what that might look like, placed on

41:19.180 --> 41:21.420
top of the brain. And I like to think of this in terms of the

41:21.420 --> 41:25.220
visual cortex is sort of the easiest for me to conceptualize.

41:25.780 --> 41:30.020
And if we think of this little red thing here as the highest

41:30.020 --> 41:32.940
frequency oscillator, sort of the letter of the neural code, if

41:32.940 --> 41:35.140
that's coding in the visual cortex, at least for the

41:35.140 --> 41:40.100
simplest thing like edges in the visual field, then the next

41:40.100 --> 41:44.060
layer, layer two is getting input from that layer. And that

41:44.060 --> 41:46.860
has to be reading that over a longer period of time. So it

41:46.860 --> 41:49.700
has enough time to get input from, let's say two edges for it

41:49.700 --> 41:52.460
to read out a higher level abstract concept or shape that

41:52.460 --> 41:57.780
looks like this. And then the next lowest layer, lower

41:57.780 --> 42:01.180
frequency reading out the input from layer two, right over a

42:01.180 --> 42:03.540
longer time scale, so that it has time to read out this shape

42:03.540 --> 42:06.260
and this shape to form a higher level abstract concept of this

42:06.260 --> 42:09.740
shape, all the way down, right, to the lowest frequency

42:09.740 --> 42:12.940
oscillator, the, let's say in this case, the default network

42:12.940 --> 42:15.180
that's reading out all of the visual information, the auditory

42:15.180 --> 42:18.020
information, the somatosensory information, the factory and

42:18.020 --> 42:22.220
internal state of the organism. And in that way, getting all of

42:22.220 --> 42:25.540
the highest level view, the highest abstract view of both

42:25.540 --> 42:27.780
the external environment, the world in the internal

42:27.780 --> 42:34.140
environment of the organism or the self. Right. So that's sort

42:34.620 --> 42:38.340
of, okay, can it, can it be the reader, sort of the integrator

42:38.340 --> 42:41.580
of the information, but then can it also be the coordinator top

42:41.580 --> 42:45.860
down? And in this way, we sort of went through that diagram, but

42:45.860 --> 42:49.380
in this case, if we're thinking, is it possible that these low

42:49.380 --> 42:54.780
frequency oscillators can essentially organize higher

42:54.780 --> 42:57.380
frequency oscillators through various mechanisms of cross

42:57.380 --> 43:00.180
frequency coupling of like phase phase coupling, phase

43:00.180 --> 43:03.140
amplitude coupling and these kinds of things. So is it possible

43:03.140 --> 43:05.340
that this lowest frequency oscillator is essentially sort

43:05.340 --> 43:07.620
of critical for setting up this hierarchy of oscillators and

43:07.620 --> 43:11.460
organizing them in sort of space and time in the brain, such

43:11.460 --> 43:15.580
that if you get rid of it, that organization, that hierarchy

43:15.700 --> 43:19.980
might disappear. And there's some evidence, right, that when you

43:19.980 --> 43:23.900
give humans psychedelics, the brain goes into a more disordered

43:23.900 --> 43:28.140
or chaotic state. And it's unclear totally. If, if you get

43:28.140 --> 43:30.540
rid of this default mode network, do you get something like

43:30.540 --> 43:32.420
this, where you have all these other oscillators that are all

43:32.420 --> 43:35.460
like this or do the oscillators themselves go completely out of

43:35.460 --> 43:38.980
order and you just get complete chaos, right? And it seems to

43:38.980 --> 43:41.860
me that it's not the latter of that complete chaos, because it

43:41.860 --> 43:44.060
seems like, you know, if people report psychedelic

43:44.060 --> 43:46.500
experiences, it's like, they're still having some kind of

43:46.500 --> 43:49.580
experience, it's just less order that you might be having those

43:49.580 --> 43:52.580
ensembles playing in a different order than you normally would.

43:54.060 --> 43:57.460
So all this is complete speculation, right? And so it's

43:57.460 --> 43:59.660
because it's very difficult, like I said, to image or

43:59.660 --> 44:02.660
manipulate human brain. So luckily, this thing appears to be

44:02.660 --> 44:07.180
highly conserved. So you have humans, monkeys, rats, a hierarchy

44:07.180 --> 44:09.820
of brain white oscillations have been found a bunch of insects

44:09.820 --> 44:13.380
also. And then this gets into some, you know, really out there

44:13.380 --> 44:16.640
stuff where we're talking about finding these things in even in

44:16.640 --> 44:19.220
systems that don't have a nervous system. So people have

44:19.220 --> 44:21.580
been looking at this kind of thing in plants for a long

44:21.580 --> 44:24.300
time, when you just put a microelectrode array in their

44:24.300 --> 44:30.740
root, and you see these kinds of, let's say electrical spikes in

44:30.740 --> 44:34.540
plants that Belusca and others have been saying for a long time

44:34.540 --> 44:36.140
might be involved in information integration and

44:36.140 --> 44:41.280
communication plant wide. And then Adamatsky putting this, these

44:41.280 --> 44:44.860
electrodes into oyster mushrooms, and just finding the same

44:44.860 --> 44:52.060
thing, like, yeah, these, these global organism wide electrical

44:52.060 --> 44:56.860
spikes. Yeah, and this animal that he's doing all kinds of

44:56.860 --> 44:59.420
interesting things to about is this is this is a fungal

44:59.420 --> 45:03.300
language. And that kind of thing. And then same thing with

45:03.300 --> 45:08.180
amoeba, finding these low frequency, I guess, electrical

45:08.180 --> 45:11.580
like oscillations or spikes, it's unclear what they're made of,

45:11.620 --> 45:14.780
right, in that case, and then bacteria here in single cells

45:14.780 --> 45:18.700
when I'm going first made the voltage indicators of putting

45:18.700 --> 45:21.280
those into single cells, and seeing that even bacteria are

45:21.280 --> 45:25.280
having these low frequency electrical oscillations, that

45:25.280 --> 45:28.560
then if you play that movie too, and you didn't, and I didn't

45:28.560 --> 45:30.840
tell you that those are bacteria, you might think that those

45:30.840 --> 45:37.240
aren't like a dish of neurons, you know, flashing. And then,

45:37.440 --> 45:41.680
once you put them together, as you know, into a biofilm, right,

45:41.680 --> 45:45.120
so those individual bacteria, you put them together, they, they

45:45.120 --> 45:50.720
generate these global sort of biofilm wide potassium waves

45:50.720 --> 45:54.760
that help them coordinate themselves as one giant unit,

45:54.800 --> 45:56.800
and then not only can they do that with themselves, but they

45:56.800 --> 46:01.160
can do this, you know, long range. So biofilm one wants to

46:01.160 --> 46:05.280
eat, and biofilm two wants to eat. If there's enough nutrients,

46:05.480 --> 46:09.440
they eat at the same time. But if there's not, they can

46:09.440 --> 46:13.280
coordinate nutrient sharing, and then they sort of oscillate in

46:13.280 --> 46:17.360
anti phase. So the general idea then just being that are these

46:17.360 --> 46:21.760
low frequency electrical oscillations, right, ways to

46:21.760 --> 46:26.000
coordinate otherwise autonomous units into coherent holes, no

46:26.000 --> 46:30.160
matter where you are with or without a nervous system. Right,

46:30.160 --> 46:33.120
so this, this gets a little bit, you got to take a lot of drugs

46:33.120 --> 46:37.160
to watch this, but this is, this is what I just showed you,

46:37.160 --> 46:40.000
right, we're all very used to this, the neural tissue being

46:40.000 --> 46:44.560
electrical, you get ions flowing through. And, and that's how

46:44.560 --> 46:46.600
you, you know, you generate action potentials, we're all

46:46.600 --> 46:52.320
used to that. But this is where people get confused, okay, hung

46:52.320 --> 46:56.360
up, where you're leading the chart, this is, this is what

46:56.360 --> 46:59.480
yeah, like when I when I learned of your stuff, I was like, no

46:59.480 --> 47:03.800
way. So yeah, it's like, of course, this is how this works.

47:04.080 --> 47:07.320
Um, it's just a different, it's just slower, right, people for

47:07.320 --> 47:09.680
really hard time. And I think this is going to be out there,

47:09.680 --> 47:12.680
but like, I'm excited to think of like, different scales of

47:12.680 --> 47:15.360
like, planetary or really small, we can't deal with. And it's

47:15.360 --> 47:17.560
like, even in the biological sphere, we can't deal with like

47:17.560 --> 47:22.520
different spatial stuff. But yeah, this is just, it's just

47:22.520 --> 47:25.400
slower. So you can have ions flowing through gap junctions

47:25.400 --> 47:30.760
and non neural tissue. And this, you know, I'd be very curious

47:30.760 --> 47:35.120
to know what you think or what you're finding in terms of any

47:35.120 --> 47:42.440
of these, let's say, non neural bioelectric networks. If, if

47:42.440 --> 47:45.160
you're finding anything of the sort, if there are, there are

47:45.160 --> 47:48.960
any kind of like, you know, higher frequency oscillations or

47:48.960 --> 47:51.640
lower frequency oscillations, and if there's any of that, that

47:51.640 --> 47:56.400
that's sort of organizing even the non neural tissue, we can get

47:56.400 --> 47:58.920
there in a second. But that would be the idea is it's a very

47:58.920 --> 48:03.640
similar thing as I was just saying up here that, yeah, you

48:03.640 --> 48:07.080
have individual cells that would be, you know, that the voltage

48:07.080 --> 48:10.280
there, if there's some kind of fluctuation would be also

48:10.440 --> 48:13.960
some higher frequency. And those can be sort of put into

48:13.960 --> 48:17.720
groups of a lower frequency to form, let's say, a subunit, like

48:17.720 --> 48:20.840
an arm, and then you can have a bunch of those arms being read

48:20.840 --> 48:30.440
out, right? Yeah, okay. What time is it? Okay, yeah, yeah. And,

48:30.440 --> 48:35.000
and, and on up to sort of, to sort of like build chunks of

48:35.000 --> 48:40.760
bodies based on on a similar, let's say principle of these

48:40.760 --> 48:46.360
voltage circuits, being read out by lower and lower frequency

48:46.360 --> 48:50.760
oscillators. And then in single cells, is this possible that

48:50.760 --> 48:53.720
instead of proteins being sort of just the structural units of

48:53.720 --> 48:57.000
cells, which is what I've been taught my whole life, is it

48:57.000 --> 49:00.040
possible that these things are actually themselves conducting

49:00.760 --> 49:04.600
electricity, which is what I'm forgetting his name now, Stuart

49:04.600 --> 49:08.600
Lindsay at Arizona has shown that you get like nano semen

49:08.600 --> 49:11.720
currents flowing through all proteins, no matter he just

49:11.720 --> 49:15.320
picked six at random, like BSA, collagen, some things that you

49:15.320 --> 49:17.560
just wouldn't be like, oh, that's conducting electricity, why

49:17.560 --> 49:23.320
would it be? So is it the case that cells are actually true

49:23.320 --> 49:27.560
little living computer chips, where the proteins are forming

49:28.280 --> 49:31.560
electrical circuits on and off, and that metabolism itself

49:31.560 --> 49:34.280
we've been taught is sort of generating ATP and energy, but

49:34.280 --> 49:36.920
it's also generating a bunch of hydrogen ions. And so is it

49:36.920 --> 49:40.520
also just giving us a pool of hydrogen ions to be flowing

49:40.520 --> 49:43.160
through the computer chip. So that's, that's out there, but

49:43.160 --> 49:47.000
that's, that's what I was thinking on that one. Okay, so

49:47.000 --> 49:48.680
right, so you can build all these things in these different

49:48.680 --> 49:51.160
ways at these different scales. And, and so what might they be

49:51.160 --> 49:53.720
doing again, could they be sort of maintaining systems out on

49:53.800 --> 49:58.680
your criticality, right? If in the human brain, for example,

49:58.680 --> 50:01.000
with the default mode network around is thought to be at

50:01.000 --> 50:06.600
criticality, where I can sort of help the system form patterns

50:06.600 --> 50:13.080
at a useful time scale. But you imagine, you can also then

50:13.080 --> 50:15.960
have a system that's totally on or totally off, you either

50:15.960 --> 50:19.960
have brain death, or totally on speed is a tonic chronic

50:20.040 --> 50:24.440
seizure, or totally disordered, in terms of total total chaos.

50:24.440 --> 50:27.320
And this appears to be what happens, you go towards chaos,

50:27.320 --> 50:29.640
if you get rid of this organizer and at least the human

50:29.640 --> 50:32.120
brain. So I don't know what happens in any of these other

50:32.120 --> 50:35.240
systems, if you get rid of that. So again, integrating all the

50:35.240 --> 50:38.040
bottom of electrical information in the system, and then

50:38.040 --> 50:43.240
coordinating at top down. And so very quickly on that, not

50:43.240 --> 50:48.200
only with this thing sort of maybe maintained the overall

50:48.280 --> 50:51.880
electrical sort of organization or structure of the system,

50:51.880 --> 51:00.120
but then it's the spikes of that oscillator are not totally

51:00.120 --> 51:02.680
constant, like a mechanical clock that you get, you know,

51:02.680 --> 51:06.760
every 60 seconds, it's variable. And I think that would be

51:06.760 --> 51:10.040
variable in terms of like, external and internal input,

51:10.040 --> 51:13.160
so that it can sort of coordinate the entire system top

51:13.160 --> 51:16.040
down and provide some kind of information about the overall

51:16.120 --> 51:19.560
state of the system by how frequently it's firing. And so

51:19.560 --> 51:22.440
that's complete speculation there. Low frequency, you're

51:22.440 --> 51:25.800
sort of saying, okay, within a range of frequencies, everyone

51:25.800 --> 51:28.680
that's local gets some kind of global piece of information

51:28.680 --> 51:33.000
that's giving everyone that that knowledge that this is this

51:33.000 --> 51:35.720
frequency means everything is cool, keep doing your local

51:35.720 --> 51:39.160
job, however you do it. And a higher frequency signal means

51:39.160 --> 51:43.720
something else to the local function. And there maybe need

51:43.720 --> 51:48.760
to speed up their processes. Right. So, so again, is this is

51:48.760 --> 51:52.200
this thing conserved in Hydra? And so that's sort of what I

51:52.200 --> 51:54.520
want to do is just start testing this thing there. And to

51:54.520 --> 51:57.080
just speed this up is to just say, does the does the Hydra

51:57.080 --> 51:59.480
cell phone serve as the organizer? Sorry, organisms

51:59.480 --> 52:02.600
unifier, an ultimate integrator of both its internal and

52:02.600 --> 52:04.920
external input to generate coherent behavior, i.e. a

52:04.920 --> 52:08.360
unified self, and I'll just breeze through. So again, just

52:08.360 --> 52:11.160
to quickly say that first of all how to do all this manual

52:11.240 --> 52:14.600
tracking by hand. And so what I've been spending my time

52:14.600 --> 52:17.960
doing is trying to get all this automatic working with a

52:17.960 --> 52:21.320
group of people in Rafa's lab to sort of make a I don't know

52:21.320 --> 52:25.640
if people can see this or what, but the dual color animals so

52:25.640 --> 52:28.040
that you can use that nucleus that never disappears while

52:28.040 --> 52:30.280
the animals moving because keep in mind in all other neural

52:30.280 --> 52:32.360
systems, you're putting a microscope on the head of the

52:32.360 --> 52:38.120
thing. And it's not moving much, but this entire system is

52:38.120 --> 52:39.640
moving. So you have to figure out a way to track it and

52:39.640 --> 52:42.440
extract all of those calcium signals from each neuron and

52:42.440 --> 52:46.440
end up down here with individual spikes from each of

52:46.440 --> 52:49.240
those neurons. And what's another interesting or I think

52:49.240 --> 52:52.440
potentially unique thing about Hydra is from Christos

52:52.440 --> 52:55.240
initial work when he put an electrode in, at least in one

52:55.240 --> 52:57.720
of the particular neurons in Hydra does appear that one

52:57.720 --> 53:00.600
calcium spike equates to about one active potential. So just

53:00.600 --> 53:04.120
using optical information from this animal, you can

53:04.120 --> 53:07.960
essentially capture every spike from every neuron and get a

53:07.960 --> 53:11.080
real clear picture because in other systems, a calcium is

53:11.080 --> 53:15.400
equate to many, many active potentials in the mouse, for

53:15.400 --> 53:20.840
example. So it's hard to have that as you only read out.

53:20.840 --> 53:24.440
Okay, right. So I'll just show you really quickly this beautiful

53:24.440 --> 53:30.520
movie. This is right. So those are the all of the the TD

53:30.520 --> 53:33.720
Tomato and then the G Camp seven neurons there. So then you

53:33.800 --> 53:39.560
can track all of that and do the signal analysis. And then you

53:39.560 --> 53:44.040
can write then you can also do these automatic behavior

53:44.040 --> 53:47.160
tracking using deep block cut so that you can do automated

53:47.160 --> 53:49.560
behavior and automated neural signal and start making sense

53:49.560 --> 53:53.080
of this stuff. And so with that, I'll just I'll just end with a

53:53.080 --> 53:55.400
few like teasers, right? So like this is just to show you

53:55.400 --> 53:59.560
prove that Hydra's lays there and rests and it still has this

53:59.560 --> 54:01.560
neural activity which will flash in a second right there. So

54:01.640 --> 54:04.360
you can start asking. So what is the relationship between

54:04.360 --> 54:06.920
that network and its other two networks? Is that network

54:06.920 --> 54:09.880
actually predictive of global neural activity in this animal

54:09.880 --> 54:12.600
and all of those kinds of studies? What's really I think

54:12.600 --> 54:15.160
unique about Hydra is this, right? These two other things

54:15.160 --> 54:18.760
that you can do where this is the parent animal, this is the

54:18.760 --> 54:20.840
foot in the head and this is a bud. This is an early bud

54:20.840 --> 54:22.920
coming off and you can start to say, okay, this is again,

54:22.920 --> 54:25.480
this is genetically identical animal. This is one slab of

54:25.480 --> 54:28.120
tissue. But at some point, the genetically identical thing

54:28.120 --> 54:31.240
becomes two individuals, right? And how does that happen? You

54:31.240 --> 54:35.960
can like so, right? At this point at this stage, their

54:35.960 --> 54:39.400
global neural activity is essentially looking the same

54:39.400 --> 54:41.960
and their behavior is essentially the same. But at some

54:41.960 --> 54:45.560
point, that tissue becomes three different individuals. So

54:45.560 --> 54:49.080
this is a bud here, a bud here and the parent here, and

54:49.080 --> 54:52.360
they're flashing so asynchronously, right? Like

54:52.360 --> 54:54.440
different Christmas trees and they start to develop

54:54.440 --> 54:56.920
completely independent behavior. So you can sort of, you

54:56.920 --> 54:59.720
know, go to town on all of those kinds of questions. And

54:59.720 --> 55:02.520
then you can also do all kinds of other crazy shit, which is

55:02.520 --> 55:04.760
cut, make these two animals with two heads and you would

55:04.760 --> 55:06.920
expect sort of like a split brain patient. You're sharing one

55:06.920 --> 55:11.080
body, you have two heads, one foot. In this case, these, I

55:11.080 --> 55:14.200
would have predicted they're gonna, you know, act

55:14.200 --> 55:16.840
independently. But it's also the case that it looks like

55:16.840 --> 55:20.680
Hydra's brain like the plant might be in its foot. So these

55:20.680 --> 55:25.160
actually start acting basically the same. But you can, and I

55:25.160 --> 55:26.680
didn't know if this would be possible, you can actually

55:26.680 --> 55:31.800
break a Hydra. So if you make a split foot, then it starts

55:31.800 --> 55:35.880
acting. So this was contracting independently of this foot.

55:35.880 --> 55:38.840
And then all of its sort of nervousness was sort of broken

55:38.840 --> 55:41.800
that it's not, it is no longer one coherent thing. So even

55:41.800 --> 55:45.480
the tentacles, it's sort of the body here is, is, is, let's

55:45.480 --> 55:48.520
say, flashing independently of this foot independently of

55:48.520 --> 55:52.120
that one. And so it's sort of having a hard time trying to

55:52.120 --> 55:58.840
coordinate itself as one coherent thing. Right. Right. So

55:58.840 --> 56:02.200
yeah, so just to conclude that these things, you know, low

56:02.200 --> 56:04.200
frequency electrical oscillations are found through the

56:04.200 --> 56:06.520
living world. We don't really know what they're doing. This

56:06.520 --> 56:09.640
crazy hypothesis is that are they, you know, overall

56:09.640 --> 56:12.120
electrical organism organizers that can do these three

56:12.120 --> 56:14.920
jobs, maintaining systems out of near criticality that if you

56:14.920 --> 56:19.480
get rid of them, you go more towards chaos disorder. And

56:19.480 --> 56:23.480
then are they integrating the little information and then

56:23.480 --> 56:27.000
from that top level view, coordinating everything from

56:27.000 --> 56:29.480
the top down. And then I'm going to start trying to test

56:29.480 --> 56:32.840
these things out. These tools have been built. So there's the

56:32.840 --> 56:35.880
the world one tour. And I'd like to thank all those people

56:35.880 --> 56:39.480
that have contributed all this. And you for sitting here.

56:39.480 --> 56:43.720
Yeah. That was awesome. Thank you so much. Yes. Super

56:43.720 --> 56:45.480
interesting. We're going to have to, we're going to have to

56:45.480 --> 56:49.400
schedule a part two because there's a bunch of things I

56:49.400 --> 56:52.520
want to I want to ask you and and and also talk about this

56:52.520 --> 56:56.120
the cell phone concept, both in cells and embryos and then

56:56.120 --> 57:00.360
outside of electrophysiology in general, because we're

57:00.360 --> 57:02.520
starting to see something similar in other systems that

57:02.520 --> 57:05.560
are not natively electrophysiological at all. Yeah.

57:05.560 --> 57:08.360
So so I think this is this is a more, you know, what you've

57:08.360 --> 57:12.280
got here is a very kind of profound generic concept that

57:12.280 --> 57:15.560
I think could apply to a lot of things. Yeah, awesome. Love

57:15.640 --> 57:21.160
it. Yeah. All right. Thank you so much. Yeah. Great. Yeah.

57:21.160 --> 57:26.280
We'll talk soon. All right. See you. Okay. Thanks.
