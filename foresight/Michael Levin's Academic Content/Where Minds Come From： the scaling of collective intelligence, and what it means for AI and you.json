{"text": " So thanks everybody for being here and letting me share some some ideas with you. If anybody's interested in the details of it, you can track them down at this website. Here's all the papers, the software, the data sets, everything. Here is where I put some more speculative kinds of things where I talk about what I think the papers mean and so on. So you're welcome to welcome to check them out. What I'm going to talk to you about today is kind of a weird topic. I'm going to talk about a little bit about AI and the right way to understand AI through the lens of collective intelligence. In other words, we're going to take a kind of a deep dive into where minds come from so that we can actually talk about this notion of whether artificial minds have the same status as biologically evolved ones and so on. And so we're going to look at those kind of questions. So the main points of today, what I'd like to do is this. We're going to look under the hood of biology a little bit to kind of clear out some viewpoints and some terminology that's persisted with us for centuries, basically, but I think are going to have to change and this idea of discrete natural kinds in biology. So we'll talk about that. We'll talk about diverse intelligence in particular collective intelligence. So very kind of unconventional minds and unconventional cognitive systems. And I'm going to argue that all the things that people argue about today in terms of artificial intelligence are basically kind of an off ramp to a much deeper, more difficult discussion about the really deep philosophical questions about what we are, what about freedom of embodiment and things like that. It's actually much more, it's a much more complicated set of questions than just to focus on kind of today's AIs. And so we'll talk a little bit at the end about the ethics and the future of humanity and things like that. So let's start with this. This is a well-known painting. It's called Adam Names the Animals in the Garden of Eden. Here he is. So this is the old Judeo-Christian story where animals are showing up and Adam gets to name them. Now, something important about that story is that actually it was on Adam to name the animals. God couldn't do it. The angels couldn't do it. Adam was the one that had to name them. I think that's a very interesting part of that story. And I think for us it has two lessons. One that we're going to have to break, I think, as the future moves on. And the other one that's actually very deep and that we're going to have to dive into. The part that has to be given up is this notion that all of these species are discrete. They're natural kinds. Everybody knows what each of these are. They're separate from the others. In fact, Adam is also a discrete entity and completely different from all of the others. And this idea that you can sort of number and categorize very, very specific types of beings. And that's what they're, you can sort of count the animals in your environment. As you'll see in a minute, I think that idea has to go. But what's deep is this notion that Adam, because he is the one that has to live with him, he is the one that has to give them names. Now, in these old traditions, giving something a name was very deep and spiritual. It meant that you've discovered their true nature. Knowing the name of something means you know their true nature. And as I'm going to show you at the end of this talk, because of synthetic biology and bioengineering and some other disciplines, we are going to have to name or discover the true nature of all kinds of unusual creatures that you guys will all be living with in your lifetime. So let's start there. Here's the part that has to break. So here's a normal modern human. Lots of philosophy talks about the human mind that does this and that and humans have responsibilities and rights and all the interesting things. But we know that now, because of evolution and also because of developmental biology, that this is not a sharp category. In other words, if you just track backwards in time, these modern humans are at a particular point in the evolution of a lineage that goes all the way back to single cell organisms. So if you have something to say about humans, you might ask yourself, well, what about the humans of a couple of hundred thousand years ago? What about the hominids of a couple million years ago? What about them? And just understand that all these changes are slow and gradual. And the same thing about development. Whatever you think is true of humans with their true hopes and dreams and cognitive responsibilities and so on. At one point, they were a single cell and this process is again very slow and gradual. And so we know now that there's this continuum, right? It's not just a discreet human, but actually a whole continuum of forms that you might have to decide what is the status of these other forms. Not only that, but there's this other continuum going horizontal here in my diagram, where we know that humans are going to be modified and improved. So for various health applications, but also for augmentation technologies, there's no particular reason why anybody is going to want to be stuck in the body that random vagaries of evolution left them with. So, you know, I don't think anybody really thinks that a mature, modern humanity, you know, a hundred years from now is going to be susceptible to the same dumb diseases, lower back pain, astigmatism, viruses. You know, presumably all that is going to get fixed. There's nothing magic about where evolution happened to have dropped us. And so there are technological modifications. There are biological modifications that will be made. And that's because at every level of organization in our bodies from subcellular materials all the way up, you can introduce different kinds of novel engineered components. And so all of this is now possible. And again, if you have thoughts about what a human is versus what a machine is, you have to ask yourself, how are you going to distinguish this when you are confronted with all sorts of beings along this continuum? You know, you're going to need to find ways to relate to them. And so one of the things that I've been working on for some years now is a framework to be able to recognize, to create, and to ethically relate to truly diverse intelligences that we can have relationships with regardless of their composition, meaning what they're made of, or their origin story, where they evolved, did they come out of a factory or some combination of those. And that means that we need to think about all of these things. So familiar kinds of creatures like primates and birds and maybe an octopus and so on. But also all kinds of weird organisms like colonial organisms, swarms, synthetic engineered new life forms, artificial intelligence is whether robotic, meaning embodied or pure software AI, and maybe even someday aliens, right, there's probably some sort of exobiological life form out there somewhere with that at some point we'll confront. Now, we need to be able to think about all of these in the same way, regardless of where they came from or what they're made of. Now, I'm not the first person to try for this. So here's Rosenbluth, Wiener and Bigelow in 1943, trying for this scale all the way from passive matter. So, you know, rocks and sand and things like that, all the way up to different kinds of active matter, and then various kinds of computational matter, and agential materials, which is what I'm going to be talking about today, all the way up to some sort of human metacognition, you know, complex, complex human kinds of minds and beyond. And the goal of this kind of framework is not just it's not philosophy. The goal is to first of all, move experimental work forward. So, part of my framework is a very strong insistence that when you look at something and you say that's not real cognition or that, you know, that is real, you know, this thing really does have intelligence. The goal of this is not just to have philosophical feelings about it, it's to have a toolkit for interacting with these systems that is beneficial, that gives us new, brings new discoveries, new capabilities, biomedicine, engineering, and so on. And also puts ethics on a better footing, because these old categories that we've had for a really long time for how we deal with other beings are really not going to be of use anymore, and the details are all here if you want to follow that. So, a basic fact from developmental biology is that we all make this amazing journey from what people call just physics. I really don't like that phrase, but people use it. So, just physics to a complex mind. So, each of us started life here as a single cell, a little blob of chemicals, and slowly and gradually it became something like this, or even something like this. So, you know, a complex metacognitive being who's going to say things about not being a machine and so on. This process is gradual. You need to understand developmental biology gives us no magic bright line at which point, boom, you know, you were just chemistry and physics, but bang, there, there, that this is where the mind appears. There isn't anything like that. It's a very slow and gradual process. And so, what that means is that scientists and philosophers need to develop a story of scaling. We need to understand how the properties of this thing, which follows the laws of chemistry and physics, ends up being something that's also describable by the laws of psychology and psychoanalysis and things like that. The reason that this is possible is because we are all made of an agential material, unlike legos and wood and metal and things like that, that basically just stay where you put them. We are made of a material with agendas. And so, this is the kind of thing we're made of. This is a single cell, okay? This happens to be a free-living organism called a lacrimaria. You can see that it's extremely competent in its local unicellular goals. So, there's no brain, there's no nervous system, there are no stem cells. But this thing is doing everything it needs to maintain its physiological, its metabolic, and behavioral goals. So, the first kind of shocking thing to some people that you need to realize is that we are all made of this interesting kind of stuff that has its own agendas. I don't have time to tell you about it today, but the reality is these things, ourselves, can learn. They can actually have pretty complex problem-solving capacities in different kinds of environments. And so, we are a very interesting construction of a very unusual type of material with which we are just now starting to learn how to engineer. But at least, you might think, at least we are a true unified intelligence, right? So, maybe you can call an ant colony some kind of collective intelligence, but we have a brain where we feel like a single unified being. So, at least we are a true unified intelligence. And in fact, Ren\u00e9 Descartes really liked the pineal gland because there's only one of them in the brain. And he thought that that's where the human experience was centralized because there's no multiple aspects of it, there's just one in the brain. But if he had had access to a microscope, he would have discovered that inside this pineal gland is all this stuff, it's a bunch of cells, and inside of each of those cells is all this stuff, okay? There isn't one of anything in the brain, and all of us are collective intelligences. We are all made of parts that do things. And the real trick here, again, is that scaling story is to tell a convincing, to give a convincing account of how it is that all these parts give rise to something that is a centralized, that has the feeling of being a centralized unified self. And so, this is what my group works on. Now, it's interesting that Alan Turing, who is basically the father of modern computer science, he was very interested in machine intelligence and in computation and programmability and things like this. And so, everybody knows that part. But one weird thing is that he also published this paper called The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, which was basically an attempt to understand how the chemicals of an embryo organize into order from their initial disorder. Now, you might wonder why would a guy who's interested in computation and intelligence and machine minds and things like that, why would he be studying the chemicals in an embryo? And I think that, although he didn't write about it, I think that Turing saw a very profound truth, which is that the process by which bodies come to be in this physical universe, by which your body was self-organized from a bunch of chemicals in the other side, is very closely related in a profound way to the question of where minds come from. So, the origin of the self-assembly of your mind and of your body are very related stories, even though they're treated by completely different communities. So, neuroscience and the behavioral sciences versus developmental biology, molecular biology, cell biology, typically those folks do not think they're studying the same thing. And I think they're studying exactly the same thing just in different components. So, to look a little further into where we come from. So, this is an embryonic blastoderm. So, that's basically a flat sheet of cells. So, in the beginning, what will happen is that the egg will get fertilized, it will divide, and then eventually flatten out and give rise to, at least in amniotes like us, it will give rise to a flat sheet of cells. So, you can think about like a little disk or something like that. That's just a couple cell layers thick. And so, here's your disk. And so, let's just imagine there's about 50,000 cells at this point in this disk. And we look at it and we say, ah, there's an embryo, maybe a human embryo or a mouse embryo or something. Actually, mice have a different structure than this. They're kind of weird, but let's say rabbit. So, human or rabbit or some other amniotes. You look at that and you say, there's one embryo, but there's 50,000 cells. What are you actually counting when you say there's one embryo? Well, what you're counting is, you're really counting alignment. You're counting the fact that all of those cells are committed to the same story of what they're going to do in anatomical space. They're all going to collaborate to build a very particular kind of embryo. They are all connected together and they are all going to cooperate to do one specific thing, which is to build that. That's what makes this an embryo. What makes this an embryo is that all of these cells are committed to the same plan. That doesn't have to be the case. And so, this is some work that was first done in the 40s. I did it again when I was a grad student in the 96 or so. When you take a duck embryo and you use a little needle to scratch some scratches into it like that, what you'll see is these little islands here for the next few hours before they rejoin again, each of these islands doesn't realize the other one is there. So, what they do is they self-organize a new embryo. Each one of them thinks they're the only one, so they make an embryo. And when they do heal up, you end up with this kind of conjoined twin or triplet. You end up with a few individual animals coming out of the same blastoderm. So, the question of how many beings, how many cells are actually in an embryo is tricky. It's not fixed by the genetics. It's anywhere from zero to probably half a dozen or more depending on what happens. The cells arise in this medium, this cellular blastoderm in real time as a process of physiology. It's not hard-coded. And what that means is that a self has to put itself together. It has to figure out a border between itself and the outside world. So, here's three embryonic fields sitting there. Each of these cells has to decide, am I part of this one, or am I part of that one, or who am I part of? And this kind of thing, this medium that can fragment or come together to form some number of coherent individuals is not just for development. This happens in the brain as well. So, we have split brain patients that have a cut between their two hemispheres that actually end up having, you then find out that they have actually, in an important sense, there are two individuals in there that have different opinions and so on. You can have lots of dissociative identity disorders and various other phenomena that make it clear that it's not so simple as the brain has one cognitive owner and the body has one embryo. It's actually not that simple. And you learn about this when you think about something like this. So, here's a rat. You train the rat to press the lever and get a delicious reward. But the thing is that there are cells in this rat that interact with the lever. There are cells in this gut that get the sugar, but there is no single cell that has both experiences. So, who is it that owns this associative memory, the fact that the pellet is associated with pressing the lever? Who owns that? Well, the owner of that memory is not any individual cell. It's the entire rat. It has to be because no cell has that experience. And there's a kind of cognitive glue that operates in this rat, which we know as the nervous system, which allows the rat to know things the individual cells don't know, such as that these two facts are connected. So, that cognitive glue is a very interesting thing. We're going to study that more of that momentarily. But I want to be clear that these animals that you typically hear about are not the only game in town as far as some very interesting aspects of what the biology is trying to tell you. I'm going to show you a couple of these examples just to sort of expand our horizons about what we need to understand. So, here's a caterpillar. This caterpillar lives in a two-dimensional world. It's a soft-bodied creature. It has a controller, a specific brain that's very well suited for driving this kind of soft body around. But it needs to turn into this. This is a flying kind of creature with hard elements and the brain basically, during this metamorphosis process, when the caterpillar turns into the butterfly, what happens is that the brain is pretty much dissolved. So, most of the connections are broken. Most of the cells are killed off. Huge refactoring, remodeling, new cells, new brain is built, quite different, and there's your butterfly. So, that already is kind of amazing. And you can imagine the sort of philosophical question of what's it like? Never mind what's it like to be a caterpillar. What's it like to be a caterpillar changing into a butterfly in real time? Not just on an evolutionary timescale, but in your lifetime drastically. Never mind puberty. This is a major change. So, that's the first thing. But the second thing is that it turns out that memories persist through this process. So, a caterpillar that learns something will still remember it as a butterfly. So, that's amazing. How do memories persist when the brain is basically getting radically refactored? But it's even more than that because, let's say, what they did was to train caterpillars to look for leaves at a particular color disc. That kind of information is completely useless to the butterfly because, first of all, the butterfly doesn't crawl. It flies. And also, it doesn't eat leaves. So, this process has to be not just the storage of memory. It has to actively remap from what's important to the caterpillar to what's important to the butterfly. It has to generalize from the concept of leaves to the concept of food and from specific crawling motions that you might think is what this simple animal is remembering to something much more complex, a navigational process that will actually be implemented by flying here, by completely different muscles and a different architecture. So, this radical process of change, and you might think about what happens to the individual identity of this organism and what it would be like if the caterpillar knew what was coming and said, well, you're going to change radically, but don't worry, you'll still have some of your memories. It's just your priorities will be different. You love leaves now, but you're not going to care about leaves at all later and you'll want this weird nectar. What is that like? And we'll come back to this at the end of the talk. How would you convince a creature like this that this is a perfectly fine thing for them to go through and are they still here? Is this organism actually still here by the time you get to this stage? And the reason this is important for us is because humanity is going to change in a way that's somewhat reminiscent of this. So, that's one kind of example. Another example are these. These are amazing creatures called planaria, they're flatworms, and when you train them to expect food on these little bumpy circles, they will remember, and if you cut off their heads with their brain, the tail will sit there doing nothing. Eventually, the tail will regrow a brand new head, so they regenerate, every piece will regenerate, and eventually, when they regenerate, you find that they still remember the original information. So, the memory, not only does this tell you that the memory can be stored outside the brain, but also that it can be imprinted onto a new brain as the brain develops, so the movement of memories through tissues. So, all of this is possible because we have this amazing multi-scale competency architecture. At every scale in your body, from the molecular networks to the organs and tissues and even groups, these different layers are not just biological scales, but actually, they have the ability to solve problems. In other words, they have competencies in different spaces. In the space of possible gene expressions and physiological states and anatomical layouts, all of these things have the ability to solve problems. I don't have time to show you a whole bunch of examples today, but there are some amazing examples of these things solving various problems. Now, the thing to keep in mind is that we humans are pretty terrible at detecting intelligence. I mean, we do okay with middle-sized objects moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space, crows and birds and maybe a dolphin or something like that. We can kind of recognize those as intelligence, but there are other spaces in which complex creatures navigate and spend effort and try to achieve goals and so on. There are gene expression spaces and physiological spaces. I want to focus today on what's known as anatomical morpho space. It's just basically a multi-dimensional space of all the different shapes that any structure can have. So, in this particular case, here's a planarian head and it can have different shapes, and these different shapes correspond to the different settings of these two control knobs, and so you have this two-dimensional space that shows you where all the different planarian shapes are. The actuality is for complex organisms, very high-dimensional space. What I want to look at is, I've told you that we're all made of cells, that these cells underlie the emergence or the self-assembly of a unified self, both of them, cognitively and morphologically, and I want to look at how that works. So, here we are. We start life as a collection of embryonic cells. This is a cross-section through a human torso. So, just imagine where does this incredible order come from, the structure. Everything is in the right place, the right shape, the right size, next to the right thing. Where does this order come from? And at that point, even, I mean, I've given the version of this talk to middle schoolers, and even nine-year-olds will immediately say, well, it's in the genome. We know where it is. It's in the human genome. But, of course, we can read genomes now, and we know that that isn't what the genome specifies at all. The genome talks about proteins. The genome specifies the tiny molecular hardware that every cell gets to have. This isn't directly in the genome anymore than the structure of a termite nest or the shape of a spider web is in the genome of those species. All of this is the outcome of physiology and behavior. It's the outcome of these cells doing their thing with the hardware that they've been given by their genetics. So, if the DNA specifies the hardware, how do these cells actually know what to build? How do they know when to stop? If we want to convince them to repair something that's been damaged, how do we communicate that to them? And as engineers, we can ask, actually, what else is possible? What else can we convince them to build? Same exact hardware, but what more could they build? So, I want to give you a couple of examples of the amazing nature of this process, because, see, when you look at this, you might think that, well, the biggest thing this thing has going for it is reliability, that basically it happens the same every single time. And that's true. Reliability is amazing here, but I want to show you that it's actually much more than that. What you're looking at here is the cross-section of a little tubule leading to the kidneys of a psalmander. And normally, there's about eight to 10 of these cells that work together, and they form this little structure with a space in the middle. You can do this weird trick where you cause multiple copies of the genetic material to build up in the very early embryo. And so, when that happens, you still get a normal animal, and it's normal size, but the cells are bigger. And when you take a cross-section, you find out that, well, the cells are bigger, and so now, fewer of them created the same kind of lumen. So, let's see where we are so far. Multiple copies of your chromosome, no problem. Weird cell size, no problem, because you'll scale it to the number of cells. And most of all, if you make truly gigantic cells, and you do these, these are, I think, 5N or 6N polyploid newts, when you do this, one single cell bends around itself to give you the exact same kind of structure. Now, that's remarkable because this is a different molecular mechanism. This is cell-to-cell communication. This is some sort of cytoskeletal bending. And so, what this means is that in the service of a particular high-level anatomical structure, these cells can call on different molecular mechanisms to solve their problem. Okay? So, they're using different tools in their toolkit to get to where they're going. That is a very good definition of intelligence, to reuse the affordances you have in the service of a goal when things change. So, when you're a salamander coming into the world, you don't know how many copies of your genetic material you're going to have. You don't know how many cells you're going to have or what the size of the cells are going to be. You still need to be able to get the job done. So, this is not a matter of just being reliable with fixed parts. This is the idea that what evolution is making is problem-solving agents. It's making a system that is ready for many, many unexpected things. And not just environment, not just when somebody bites your leg off and the salamander regenerates it. No, this is unreliability of your own parts. This is not even being sure of what you're made of. You really can't depend on much. And that's an amazing thing. And it's quite different than what you normally get in a biology curriculum where they tell you that your genome, the purpose of your genome is to carry information from a long time away with maximal fidelity and to minimize errors. And every cell is going to do whatever the genome says. And in the end, you get this emergent thing. Actually, that's not at all what's happening here. Here's another example. We discovered this a few years ago. These tadpoles need to become frogs. In order for this tadpole face to make a frog face, all the organs have to move. So, the eyes have to move, the jaws have to move, and so on. And they normally do this quite reliably. But it was thought to be a hardwired process. You know, people thought that, well, every organ just moves in the right direction, this fixed amount, and that's it. What we did was we created these so called Picasso frogs because we wanted to test how much intelligence is actually in that process, how much, what kind of problems can it solve? So, we scrambled everything. You can see here, the eyes on the top of the head, the mouth is off to the side, everything is just a complete mess. And these guys still become normal frogs because all of these organs will move now in novel paths, paths that these guys don't do, until they get to a correct frog face, and then they stop. And so, what evolution actually has given you is not a hardwired set of instructions, but a system for error minimization. Okay, for a way of wherever you happen to start out, do whatever you have to do to end up in this particular location. This again, this kind of goal-directedness is something else that you're not going to see in your developmental biology textbook. This is not emergence, and this is not simply an increase of complexity. This is problem-solving. And that raises an obvious question about how does it know what the correct face looks like? Where is the memory for that set point of that homeostatic process? I want to show you a couple of other things related to the plasticity of this. So, just so you understand how much play there is between the fixed hardware of your genetics and the actual outcomes. First of all, this here, you might think this is a photoshop or something. I didn't believe it the first time I saw it, but this fly is running a stripped-down ant morphogenetic program on its wings. It's running a virtual ant on its wings, and the idea is that it wiggles its wings to simulate these ants scurrying about, and that keeps the predators away because they don't want to deal with ants. And this is amazing, of course, and it's striking that it has this pattern, but it's no more striking than the much more intricate pattern of the actual fly. I mean, all of these are specific morphogenetic patterns, whether 2D or 3D, carried out on this kind of hardware. And you might think that the outcomes are pretty fixed. I mean, here's an acorn, and you know that all the time what these acorns give rise to is these oak leaves. And you might think that you know what the oak genome actually does. It encodes this particular shape, but along comes a bioengineer, and this is a non-human bioengineer. This is a little wasp, and what these wasps do is they provide some signals that prompt the rest of the tissue to build something like this. They're hacking the morphogenetic competencies of this leaf. They're not changing the genome, and what they're doing is providing some instructions that cause the leaf cells to adopt a different set point in anatomical space. Now, would you ever have any idea looking at these flat green leaves, and how reliable they are? Would you have any idea that they're capable of building something like this? I mean, we have no idea. So that just reminds us that this whole notion of developmental constraint is really probably a constraint in our thinking. It's not a constraint in the biology. The option space for morphogenesis is enormous, and what we need to do is to discover the prompts, the language that we can use to get them to build other things, and it clearly doesn't require modifying the hardware. The genetics of this thing are still completely intact. So now comes kind of the meat of the talk, which is that if morphogenesis is the behavior of a collective intelligence operating in anatomical space, that's what I've been getting at for the last few slides, is the idea that the act of creating complex anatomical shapes is really behavior. It's behavior in an anatomical space of possibilities, and it's done by a collective intelligence, which just like us, we're all collective intelligences, but that collective intelligence thinks about shape as opposed to moving around in 3D space. So now we need to ask, how do we communicate with that intelligence? I mean, the WASP did it through millions of years of evolution. We would like to do it faster. And where does it store its memories? These are some things that we've been looking at. Well, we know that one way to store memories and communicate with a collective intelligence is through the nervous system. Now, the nervous system does it via computations in an electrical network, and you can actually try to decode those. This is the work of people doing a neural decoding to try to read the electrical activity of the brain and to know what thoughts and preferences and memories and so on the system has. Well, it turns out that this system, this ability to store memories in an electrical network, to use an electrical network to integrate information across many, many, many cells, both in space and in time, is something that evolution discovered a really long time ago. It is way older than nerve and muscle. Bacterial biofilms were probably the first to do this, so long predating multicellularity. And what we've done is to develop some of the first tools to read and write the mind of the collective intelligence of your body. So by taking a lot of the concepts from neuroscientists and really emphasizing this idea that neuroscience isn't about neurons at all. Neuroscience is really about scaling of information from tiny competent subunits into much larger coherent cells that have higher intelligence in other spaces. That's really what this is about. And that doesn't just work in the brain, that works in your entire body. So the first thing I want to show you is some of the techniques that can be used. One thing we have is this thing we develop called voltage sensitive fluorescent dye imaging. And that means that without having to poke the cells with electrodes, you can get in real time, this is a time lapse of a frog embryo, this is a frog putting its face together, you can get a map of all the electrical states and thus you can try to learn to decode what the system is trying to build. What are the computations that they're doing? We call this the electric face. This is a bioelectric map of the face ectoderm long before any of these organs actually appear. You can see that cells already know here's where we're going to place the eye, the left eye actually comes in a little bit later, here's where the mouth is going to go, here are the placodes. This is you are literally seeing the way you would with a brain scan, you are literally seeing the content of the collective intelligence of morphogenesis in the body of these animals. So these are normal patterns, in fact these are required for normal development as I'll show you momentarily. But here's a pathological pattern, and this is induced by injecting a human oncogene into these embryos which eventually will make a tumor. But these tumors have an aberrant bioelectrical profile because what happens, the first thing that happens with this oncogene is that it causes an electrical disconnection from cells from their environment. And when cells disconnect, they immediately lose the ability to remember these large grandiose goals that they were working on, so making complex organs and fixing defects and so on, they're just amoebas now. That boundary between self and world has now shrunk, that cognitive lycone where before the goal was the size of an organ or maybe the whole organism, now it's down to the size of a single cell, and to them the rest of the body is just an environment now. So this is where you get metastasis and progression because as far as they're concerned, they're just amoebas living in an environment, and they go where they want and they reproduce as much as they want. And so once you understand that, you can try for really interesting cancer therapeutics, which is what we're doing in our lab. Don't try to kill the cells with toxic chemotherapy. What if we reinflate their sense of self? What if we reconnect them, forcibly reconnect them to the large electrical network that can remember what a proper organ is? And so when you do that, so this is the same animal. Here's the oncoprotein has this red fluorescence on it. You can see it's blazingly strongly expressed. In fact, it's all over the place, but there's no tumor. And there's no tumor because we co-injected an ion channel that modulates, it's an RNA that modulates the electrical property of the cell to force them to remain in connection, despite what the oncogene is saying. And after that, it doesn't matter that they have this genetic defect, they behave appropriately and they build nice organs and so on. So that's a story at the level of single cells, how you scale individual cells into a larger set of goals. But I want to show you something even larger scale than that, which is we saw in that electric phase, there's a little eye spot which tells the animal that that's where the eye is going to go. So we can ask a simple question, what happens if you reproduce that bioelectric pattern somewhere else? Can you tell this group of cells to build an eye somewhere else? And it turns out you can. Here it is, we injected some potassium ion channel RNA into a location that normally would make a gut. So here's this is a tadpole, here's the mouth, here's the eye, here's the gut. And if you tell these cells using an appropriate voltage signal that, hey, you should be making an eye, boom, that's what they do. And these eyes have normal lens, right, an optic nerve, all the same stuff. And you might see in your developmental biology textbook that only cells in the anterior and erected are here are competent to make eye. So that isn't true, that's only true if you try to prompt them with the so-called master eye gene. So if you put in PAC-6 the master eye gene, yes, that's true, only these cells can do it. But again, that limitation of competency isn't in the embryo, that's on us. That's because we didn't know the community, didn't know the right way to talk to these cells. Once you understand the bioelectric code, actually it turns out that almost any region in this embryo is competent to make eye. And if you should happen to only inject a few cells, so here this is a lens sitting out in the tail of a tadpole somewhere, if you only inject a few cells, these blue cells are the ones we injected, then they know there's not enough of them to make a good eye, so what do they do? They recruit a bunch of their neighbors to work with them to make an eye, just like ants and termites will recruit their buddies to solve a problem. So now you can see that what we're doing is providing signals. We didn't tell these cells how to build an eye, we didn't say anything about the stem cells or the gene expression, we have no idea how to build an eye. What we did find was a message that we can transmit through this bioelectrical interface that says build an eye here. And once you get the cells by in so that they are convinced that that in fact is what they should be building, after that you don't need to do anything, they will do what they do best, they'll build to a morphogenetic spec. We know this, I want to show you, there's just a couple of things left here, I want to show you another kind of pattern memory in these planaria, so here's a normal flatworm. These guys, you can cut them into pieces and they will always regenerate correctly, so every piece normally makes a nice one-headed worm 100% of the time. But there's a bioelectric pattern there that we were able to read out and then we were able to modify it. And when you modify that pattern, you make two-headed worms. And when you make these two-headed worms, what happens is that you have rewritten the memory of what a correct worm is supposed to look like, so that when these fragments, when these middle fragments go to regenerate, they consult the pattern to see what what should a normal worm look like, they see that it says two heads, and they go ahead and they build two heads. These two-headed worms now in plain water, meaning no more manipulation of any kind, are now forever two-headed. If you keep cutting them, they will just continue to regenerate as two-headed. We have permanently changed the target morphology, the pattern to which they regenerate, but we never touch the DNA, there's nothing wrong with the genetics here. If we were to throw these guys into the Charles River, 100 years later some scientists would come along, they'd scoop up some single-headed worms and some double-headed worms, they'd say, oh, cool, a speciation event, let's sequence the genome and see what made the difference. There's nothing wrong with their genome, that's not where the information is. And so that's really important to understand that much as we've been learning from computer science for a really long time now, the hardware, if it's good hardware, does not fully constrain what the software is able to do. And so this is a kind of pattern memory, it's long-term stable, it's rewriteable because we can turn these guys back to one-headed, there you can see what these two-headed guys are doing when they're hanging out. And so the question of how many heads should a plenarian have is not written in the DNA, what is written in the DNA is the construction of some biological material that by default will develop a pattern memory that says one head, so that's what it does by default, very reliably, but you can change it, you can rewrite it. And the fact that biological tissue is reprogrammable in this way is hugely important for biomedicine and for other things. And so I hope you're starting to see that all the emphasis on genetics and on the genome and all that, it's all very important because you have to understand your hardware, but it's just the beginning. It's the same, the reason that on your laptop, if you want to switch from Photoshop to Microsoft Word, you don't get out your soldering iron and start rewiring because it's reprogrammable. Neither does biology. Biology is using an incredibly reprogrammable medium that solves problems and can be communicated with using various interfaces, for example, this bioelectrical interface. So we've talked about the reliability of development and what things do by default. We've talked about various ways to hack, communicate with and reprogram the collective intelligence of cells so they can build other variants on the form. But where do these goals actually come from? So when we called up a second head here, the second head looks just like the first head. Where are these patterns really? If it's not in the DNA, what's the space of possible patterns? What else can we do? And by the way, I didn't show you, but we can actually turn these worms into heads of other species, about 100 to 150 million years' distance. So triangular worms become round, become flat, but you can make the hardware go to other regions of that space that normally belong to other species. But okay, those are all evolutionarily defined forms. Is that it? Is that where the forms come from? They're basically selected for and then there's a finite set of forms that can be implemented by the hardware. Well, we decided to look at this in a synthetic kind of bioengineering way. And what we did was we took some cells, some skin cells from frog embryos, and we let them kind of reboot their multicellularity. We took them aside, we liberated them from their normal interactions with other cells. And what they did, they could have done many things. They could have died, they could have crawled away from each other, they could have made a flat monolayer like cell culture. What they did instead is they merged into something we then named xenobots. Xenobot because Xenopus lavus is the name of the frog, and we think this is a biorebotics platform. So they start to swim. They have little silly, little hairs that are normally used to distribute mucus down the side of the frog, but here they row. So these guys are rowing to the left, these cells are rowing to the right, and as a result, this thing moves forward. They can go in circles like this, they can kind of patrol back and forth like that. They have various collective behaviors. These two are sort of dancing around. This one's going on some sort of long journey. These ones are doing nothing. They have some very rich calcium signaling. You can see that here, which is usually a sign of some information processing that's going on in these cells. Here's one that is navigating this maze. So it's going to take this corner without bumping into the opposite wall. So there it is. And then here spontaneously, for some reason that we don't know, it turns around and goes back where it came from. It has spontaneous behavior. Again, remember, this is just skin. These are just epithelial cells. And they have lots of interesting behaviors that we can talk about. But one of the most amazing things they do is called kinematic replication. So just imagine, we've made it completely impossible for these things to reproduce the normal froggy fashion. They don't have any of the reproductive organs, they don't have any of that. But in this novel configuration, they figured out a way to make copies of themselves. And here's how they do it. If you provide them with loose skin cells, this loose material, what they do is they run around and they sort of collect those loose skin cells into little balls like this. And because what they're working with is an agential material, meaning these are not passive pellets, these are cells, for the same reason that we were able to make xenobots, they make the second generation of xenobots. And these little balls that they make mature, and guess what they do? They run around and make the next generation of xenobots and so on. And this is kinematic replication. It's kind of von Neumann's dream of a robot that went around and made copies of itself from materials it finds in the environment. I mean, just think this, there's never been any xenobots. There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot. This is not in the lineage of frogs. Where does this come from? Their shape, their behaviors, the kinematic self-replication, all the other things they can do. Where does that come from? It's very hard to say that this was the subject of selection. So again, I come back to this theme that while the hardware was absolutely selected for, I don't think it was selected to make frogs. I don't think that what evolution does is create solutions for specific problems or things that are fit in a specific environment. I think what evolution does is make creative problem-solving agents that they'll do the same thing under default conditions, but once you start making changes and challenging them, they often rise to the occasion and solve problems in very novel ways that reflect dynamics that they've not seen before. And lest you think this is some trick of, you know, unique to frogs or embryos, I mean, when we first published all this stuff, some people said, well, frogs, amphibians are pretty plastic and embryos are especially plastic. So maybe this is some kind of a specific thing in frog embryology. So the last thing I want to show you is this. So here's this little guy running around and I will ask you what this is. And you might think that this is something I got off the bottom of a pond somewhere, right, some sort of primitive organism. And then I can tell you that, well, we've sequenced its genome and you'll say, oh, what's the genome? What does it look like? And I'll say, well, this is 100% Homo sapiens. These are adult human cells. There's no embryonics here. This is adult tracheal cells taken from human donors. Most of them elderly in their 70s and 80s. And when given the chance, they reboot themselves and have a new life as these things. We call them anthropots for obvious reasons. And they have all kinds of novel shapes and behaviors. I call this kind of a technology for personalized agential interventions because if you ask, what can these things do? Well, one thing they can do is this. If you take human neurons and plate them on a dish and put a big scratch through them, these anthropots can settle down. We call this a super bot because there's probably 10 of them here. They'll settle down and within a few days you lift them up and you see that what they did was they took the two sides of the wound and they knitted the nerves together. So they have the ability to repair these kind of neural wounds. I mean, who would have thought that your tracheal cells, which normally sit quietly in your airway for decades, that given the opportunity taken out of the body, they would actually reassemble themselves into a new kind of creature with these new capacities. And so this is, I think, hugely important for the future of medicine because just imagine, once we understand what kind of healing effects these guys can have, they can be injected into your body. They do not require immune suppression because they're made of your own cells. So personalized medicine in that way. They share with your body all the priors about what health is, what diseases, inflammation, cancer. You don't have to build all those detectors from scratch like you would with some sort of engineered nanobot because these are your own cells. They already understand all those things. And so again, you start to see this plasticity. Again, what you just saw is not some embryonic developmental stage that they're recovering back in their history. There is no such stage. This is completely novel set of behaviors. And so now I'm going to finish up here with kind of some big picture thinking here. What I've been telling you about all of these stories and all of their kind of biomedical implications for cancer and birth defects and regenerative medicine, there's a bigger picture here, which is that what we're talking about is an example of how to recognize and how to communicate with an unconventional intelligence. It is not just philosophy that thinking about groups of cells as decision making, memory having goal directed beings has led us to lots of discoveries that were not made by the standard paradigm, which sees them as simple machines. So my point is that along this spectrum, I call this the spectrum of persuadability because it's all about what kind of tools you're going to use to communicate and control these various systems. So here it's hardware rewiring and maybe some control theory and cybernetics with things like thermostats. And then here maybe behavioral science and training and things like that. And then here you have some sort of rich relationship with cogent reasoning and so on. The idea is that we can't just have philosophical feelings about where things fit on this continuum. Most people assume that cells are somewhere down here, that they're basically simple machines that need to be treated that way. And that leaves a lot on the table because we're doing all kinds of interesting things with cell training and really taking advantage of the problem solving competencies of these things. And so we have to do experiments. And so that brings us back to the issue of AI because the question of AI isn't about today's language models. Today, it's pretty easy to say, well, GPT-4 isn't really like a human mind and so on. No, it isn't. And it doesn't matter for two reasons. First, because there are many interesting minds that are not human minds and some of them are quite alien. And second, because the whole point is that you can't just assume these things. You have to do experiments. You have to ask yourself, do I know where intelligence comes from? Why do simple things? And we've studied some very simple things that have amazing, unexpected, emergent, intelligent behaviors. Do we know where that comes from and how to recognize them? And I'll tell you that at this moment we don't. So this is the science of diverse intelligence. And we need to be extremely careful. And I think this is where the ethics comes in. We need to be extremely careful about not denying moral worth and various kinds of ethical protections to beings because they don't look like us. Humans have a very long history of trying to make separations between in-group and out-group based on really pretty ridiculous, very surfacing characteristics. And in your lifetime, you are going to be confronted with all sorts of novel beings. So all of Darwin's endless forms, most beautiful here on Earth, are like a tiny corner of this whole space. You know, hybrids and cyborgs and all kinds of non-neurotypical humans with implants and different kinds of connections to other creatures and to other technical systems. You know, pretty much any combination of evolved material, engineered material and software is some kind of being. Okay, there are going to be chimeras and cyborgs. And so it's not about the language models of today. It's about beings that are nowhere with you on the tree of life. You cannot decide how you're going to relate to them in the old ways, which was to, you know, sort of knock on it. And if you hear a metallic clanging sound, you say, aha, so you were made in the factory and you're boring and I can take you apart. And that's okay. Whereas if you heard like this soft, woolly thud, you would say, ah, well, you're a real being like me and I have to treat you well, even though we're not even very good at that as humans. But the point is that those kinds of categories are going to be worthless because the space of possible bodies and minds is extending radically. And we're going to have to develop much better ethical frameworks for kind of, you know, I'm sure you've heard of symbiosis, I think what we're really talking about is a kind of synthbiosis, where we have to learn how to relate to beings that are different than us. And that, you know, we're going to have to figure out how you how you detect where things are on this continuum, so that we find appropriate balance points between objectophilia. Objectophilia is the thing where people fall in love with bridges and, you know, they think the Eiffel Tower is, you know, married to them and so on. Right. So, things down here, you're not going to have that deep relationship with things up here, but other people are really trapped in the other end of the continuum where they see things that are not like today's standard humans. And they say, you know, those are not real minds worthy of care and respect and so on. And that very quickly devolves to a kind of idea that's basically love only your own kind. And I think that's that's that's probably lots much worse than this. So, we really need to, and if anybody has questions we can talk about it, we really need to ask, you know, given all of these facts, what are what is a human actually? And I have a kind of a weird answer to that. And if you were going on on a long journey and you wanted a companion, what is it that you actually care about? You know, when you say, you know, you don't want a Roomba, that's that's not enough. But what do you actually care about? It's not the DNA. It's I don't think anybody has any allegiance to our particular human DNA or the specific set of organs. What is it that you do want, you know, in a rich human level relationship? That's that's very worth thinking about. So, okay, so I'm going to I'm going to stop here. I'm anybody who's interested in this stuff. Here's a bunch of papers that go into all of this in great detail. Most importantly, I need to thank all the people who did the work that I showed you today. So, here are all the all the postdocs and students and everybody else who who contributed. We have lots of amazing collaborators. Our funding comes from all kinds of people have to do a disclosure here because there are three companies that have spun out of our lab that are supporting some of our work. So there's some business connections here. But most of all, I always thank the model system because because the various animals and plants do all of the heavy lifting in teaching us about biology and about ourselves. So thank you so much.
