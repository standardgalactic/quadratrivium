0	1240	Thank you so much.
1240	2280	Thank you for having me here.
2280	5240	It's a huge, huge pleasure to be able to share some ideas
5240	6400	with you all.
6400	8440	I've never been to this conference before
8440	12240	and I'm very gonna really enjoy saying some things
12240	17240	that are actually fairly, let's say not as radical
17700	19700	as some other things that probably people have said.
19700	21840	So that's a new experience for me.
21840	24640	And so if anybody's interested in the kinds of things I do,
24640	27160	you can find all of that here.
27160	30760	I want to say right up front to set expectations.
30760	34560	I don't particularly work on consciousness per se.
34560	38200	I work on cognition, agency, intelligence, things like that.
38200	40000	And I do think they have implications
40000	43720	and so I will kind of go out on the ledge here today.
43720	46160	But I'm gonna make a fairly modest claim.
46160	48360	I'm not going to try to produce a new theory
48360	51440	of consciousness, I'm not going to try to support
51440	53920	one specific theory of consciousness with data.
53920	55960	Here's what I'm going to try to do.
56080	58360	I'm gonna try to make a fairly simple argument
58360	62080	that if we use composition and behavior
62080	64680	as evidence of consciousness in other systems
64680	66920	when addressing the problem of other minds,
66920	69160	that is if our criteria include things like
69160	72080	what are you made of, what are your behavioral competencies
72080	74200	and so on, if that's how we address it,
74200	75960	then for the exact same reasons
75960	78000	that we tend to associate consciousness
78000	80760	with complex brains, we need to take very seriously
80760	84120	the possibility of consciousness in many body structures.
84960	87600	That's a very controversial claim in some audiences,
87600	90240	maybe it won't be particularly controversial here.
90240	92920	But what I'd really like to do is to widen
92920	95200	the set of systems about which we think
95200	97840	when we think about consciousness and related issues
97840	100840	beyond human brains, when we talk about AI,
100840	102360	I don't want to think specifically
102360	104160	about just is it human-like
104160	107480	because it's actually much more interesting than that.
107480	112000	So one of the key things is that I think
112000	115400	we have to move beyond these kind of conventional
115400	118040	intelligences, there's a famous painting of Adam
118040	120040	naming the animals in the Garden of Eden
120040	122680	and if you think that there are these
122680	124720	very sort of discreet natural kinds,
124720	127560	then one can have these binary categories
127560	131400	of which things do and do not have consciousness.
131400	132840	People are pretty sure about Adam,
132840	134240	not so sure about some of the stuff
134240	138160	that's not shown here, paramecia, slime molds,
138160	140180	they are various other things.
140180	142980	So the reason that we have to think about these things
142980	145020	is that the standard human,
145020	147780	which features prominently in philosophical accounts
147780	149220	of consciousness and so on,
149220	154220	is really just one point on two continua
155340	157340	or four, depending on how you want to count.
157340	162180	But this kind of conscious or agential glow is,
162180	164220	you have to sort of decide what happens to it
164220	166860	as you walk backwards from a modern adult human
166900	170900	all the way back to the oocyte that all of us once were.
170900	173540	You can also walk it back on an evolutionary timescale
173540	175620	and ask what happens all the way back
175620	177900	because all of these things are smooth and continuous.
177900	180780	And in fact, with modern bioengineering
180780	183140	and synthetic biology, it's now very clear
183140	185740	that both using biological means
185740	187940	and sort of hybrid technological means,
187940	192660	we can create hybrids and chimeras in every possible way
192660	195140	and really extend the typical embodiment
195140	196500	in very diverse directions.
196500	200180	And so we'll get back to this more towards the end of the talk.
200180	202340	And so what I've been working on is a framework,
202340	203860	which I call TAME,
203860	207180	or stands for technological approach for mind everywhere.
207180	210380	And the idea is to be able to recognize, create,
210380	213700	and ethically relate to truly diverse intelligences.
213700	215300	So regardless of composition,
215300	217740	meaning what you're made of or origin story,
217740	220300	meaning whether you were produced the natural way
220300	222500	or engineered or some combination thereof.
222500	226100	And I want to be able to handle all of these kinds of things.
226100	228340	And the familiar creatures, all kinds of weird colonial
228340	230300	and synthetic organisms,
230300	232740	AIs, whether software or hardware,
232740	235140	and potentially exobiological agents.
235140	238420	And so of course, people have tried before for these kinds of,
238420	242340	so this is a Rosenbluth et al from the 1940s,
242340	245780	trying for a scale of these kinds of things
245780	248340	that are not particularly bound to embodiments,
248340	249700	let's say brains and things like that,
249700	252140	very kind of cybernetic definition.
252140	254220	And I've been working on a model that has to do
254220	256300	with what I call a cognitive light cone,
256300	259980	which is this idea that all agents have one thing in common,
259980	262060	no matter what they're made of or how they got here,
262060	265940	which is the ability to pursue certain goals
265940	268620	in certain spaces and the size of those goals,
268620	272180	the literal spatial temporal size of the largest goal
272180	273500	that an agent can pursue,
273500	275100	is one way that we can classify
275100	278180	and compare very diverse intelligences.
278180	280220	And the critical thing is that,
280220	282740	as I'm primarily a developmental biologist,
283500	286340	the thing that always just astounds me
286340	288220	is that all of us were once,
288220	290460	what people call, quote unquote, just physics.
290460	294260	We were all a quiescent oocyte, a little blob of chemicals,
294260	297940	and slowly, gradually, without any magical lightning flash
297940	300260	that comes in at any particular point during development,
300260	301860	we become one of these things,
301860	303660	or perhaps even something like this
303660	305500	that can reason back and make comments
305500	307260	about not being a machine
307260	309140	or being more than physics and something like that.
309140	312660	So this process is very slow and gradual,
312660	314260	and what we're interested in
314260	318500	is that process and the scaling of competencies
318500	320740	of very simple, minimal matter,
320740	323980	chemical signals, systems and cells and tissues,
323980	327980	the scaling up of the tiny little goals of single cells,
327980	330980	so metabolic and transcriptional goals
330980	332020	and things like this,
332020	334500	into collective systems that have very large goals,
334500	336260	I'll talk about this momentarily,
336260	341260	and the kinds of failure modes that the system has,
341380	344060	which is a breakdown of that collectivity into cancer,
344060	346820	back down to cells that have little tiny goals
346820	348380	about proliferation and migration,
348380	349220	and that's it,
349220	351660	and they no longer care about the rest of the system.
351660	354100	So the meat of our research program
354100	356140	has to do with understanding the scaling,
356140	357780	understanding that cognitive light cone
357780	360660	and how it actually scales up from that of a single cell,
360660	362260	and in fact, below that in some other work
362260	365340	that we've done with Chris Fields and Carl Friston,
365340	367540	and up, up and up.
367540	369820	And one of the things that happens in development,
369820	371260	which is kind of interesting,
371260	375900	is the auto-poeses or self-construction
375900	380580	of a single individual from a kind of a pool of potentiality,
380580	381980	and it looks like this,
381980	383420	this is an early blastoderm,
383420	386880	let's say of a human or a chicken or many other animals.
386880	389220	We see, let's say 50,000 cells,
389220	391020	and we say there's an embryo.
391020	393060	What are we counting when we say that's one embryo?
393060	395020	I mean, there really isn't one of anything physical,
395020	396340	there are many, many cells.
396340	397460	What is there one of?
397460	399520	And this is gonna become an individual.
399520	401400	Well, what there's one of is alignment,
401400	406400	both physical alignment and kind of functional alignment
407560	408760	towards a particular goal.
408760	412560	That alignment is the creation of a particular target
412560	414920	morphology, a particular anatomical structure.
414920	417080	As I'll show you momentarily, if you try to deviate it,
417080	418520	it will find new ways to get there.
418520	422760	So it's definitely this kind of homeostatic system.
422760	425120	But there doesn't have to be just one.
425120	428920	And if you make temporary scratches in this blastoderm,
428920	431320	what you end up with, each of these regions
431320	433520	not being able to feel the other self-organizes
433520	434360	into an embryo.
434360	437160	And eventually you end up with twins, triplets,
437160	438920	and many other cells.
438920	442600	So the question of how many individuals are in an embryo
442600	443600	is actually not clear.
443600	445040	It's not set up by the genetics,
445040	448320	it's a physiological self-organizational process.
448320	450640	And what it means is that each one of these individuals
450640	453240	has to, on the fly, every single time
453240	455180	that they arise in this physical world,
455180	457020	they have to solve this important problem.
457020	460420	Where do I end, and where does the environment begin?
460420	462260	Every cell is some other cell's environment.
462260	465180	How do these cells know what they belong to?
465180	468900	And so as I think Turing actually recognized,
468900	472060	this question of how bodies self-organize
472060	474700	is probably fundamentally the same
474700	476860	as the question of how minds self-organize.
476860	480100	And we see these kinds of dynamics in split-brain patients
480100	481660	and dissociative disorders and so on.
481660	483500	This question of how many individuals
483500	486940	are present within a particular amount of medium
486980	488420	that underlies it.
488420	491260	And so then people who think about these things
491260	493740	often think, well, okay, we have these,
493740	495300	what we call collective intelligences,
495300	497860	colonies of ants and termites and so on.
497860	501300	But at least we are a true unified intelligence, right?
501300	503900	We sort of, many people think that there's
503900	506580	a fundamental difference between these cases.
506580	509940	But of course, and for example,
509940	511580	Descartes really liked the pineal gland
511580	513340	because it's an unpaired structure,
513340	516240	and he felt that was suitable to the unified
516240	517360	human experience.
517360	519200	But if he had had access to good microscopy,
519200	521120	he would have noticed that there isn't one
521120	522560	of anything here either.
522560	525080	This is what the pineal gland tissues look like
525080	526680	inside of each one of these cells.
526680	527840	You get all of this stuff.
527840	531560	So there's an incredible multi-scale organization.
531560	533440	And so the fact of the matter is, I think,
533440	536320	that we are all collective intelligences.
536320	539060	We are made of this kind of agential material.
539060	541520	So this is a lacrimary, it's a single cell.
541520	545160	It has no brain, it has no nervous system.
545200	547280	It's very good at taking care of local goals
547280	549440	in terms of its anatomical structure,
549440	552000	in terms of metabolism and so on.
552000	556760	And when we talk about machines and living organisms
556760	560160	and consciousness, we have to remember
560160	562040	that whatever theories we make,
562040	564960	have to make a ruling on things like this.
564960	566080	What happens here?
566080	569840	I mean, certainly people have a very chemistry-based
569840	571960	views of these things, but this is
571960	573240	what we are actually made of.
573800	576920	We may not feel like a collective of competent,
576920	579760	tiny little cells that are managing perception,
579760	581760	action, loops towards emergent goals
581760	583640	and weird problem spaces.
583640	586560	But in fact, I think that is exactly
586560	588840	what it feels like to be that kind of a system.
588840	591520	So I think we do, in fact, feel like exactly that.
591520	594160	And so the research program that we and others
594160	597360	are embarked upon is to discover the scaling rules.
597360	600040	How do we go from the individual competencies
600040	604160	of our components to rotating those goals and competencies
604160	606040	into novel spaces?
606040	610360	And so in bodies, not just human, but all bodies,
610360	613480	biology uses this kind of multi-scale competency
613480	617280	architecture, this idea that we are not only nested dolls
617280	620440	structurally, cells, molecular networks,
620440	624040	made of making up cells and tissues and organs and so on.
624040	625800	But actually, each one of these layers
625800	628720	has its own problem-solving capacity.
628720	632160	They are all solving problems in different spaces,
632160	635320	anatomical morpho space, the space of gene expression,
635320	636800	the space of physiological states,
636800	639280	and of course, familiar old three-dimensional behavioral
639280	639960	space.
639960	643480	And so that, I really like William James's definition
643480	645800	of intelligence, which is the ability
645800	648480	to reach the same end by different means
648480	650560	using some degree of sophistication.
650560	656080	So it's very good because it's, again, substrate invariant.
656080	660840	It really talks about the idea of a spectrum of competencies,
660840	664000	and it's kind of agnostic about what space we're working.
664000	665920	And that becomes important because, for example,
665920	668920	in conversations about AIs and other things,
668920	670480	when we say they're not embodied,
670480	673680	I think we really need to expand our understanding of what
673680	675600	spaces we could be embodied in.
675600	678880	And so we and many other animals are
678880	681760	pretty good at recognizing intelligence
681760	685280	in familiar three-dimensional space, so good old behavior.
685320	688600	And this medium-sized objects moving
688600	690760	at medium speeds in three-dimensional space
690760	693640	were kind of familiar with birds and primates
693640	695560	and other things doing that.
695560	698400	But biology does the same thing in other spaces.
698400	700080	So there are transcriptional spaces
700080	703440	where cells are able to solve very interesting problems.
703440	705160	Same thing with physiological space.
705160	707280	I don't have time today, but I could give you
707280	710960	some amazing examples of cells exerting
710960	714480	novel problem-solving behaviors by navigating these spaces.
714480	716040	What I will focus on for a few minutes
716040	718440	is this anatomical morphospace.
718440	722440	So this is basically the space of all possible configurations
722440	723600	of a group of cells.
723600	727680	So Darcy Thompson in the 40s was, I think, the first
727680	732000	to really get an idea of this idea of embryos
732000	737600	and other morphogenetic systems navigating that morphospace.
737600	739240	And I think we really have to get into the idea
739240	742280	that beings can be embodied and can have consciousness
742280	743960	in these other spaces.
743960	746400	I think that while we're very good at this,
746400	749600	if you could imagine if you had an innate, immediate sense
749600	751440	of your blood chemistry, let's say,
751440	753720	I think you would have no problem recognizing
753720	755360	that you live in a higher-dimensional space
755360	757640	and that your liver, your kidneys, and other organs
757640	760480	are, in fact, problem-solving intelligent agents
760480	763480	that are navigating that space exactly the way
763480	765520	you navigate three-dimensional space.
765520	767960	So let's focus on morphospace and talk for a few minutes
767960	772040	about what the competencies are of this.
772520	775400	What we argue is that, actually, morphogenesis
775400	777720	is the behavior of a collective intelligence.
777720	779520	It's the collective intelligence of cells
779520	783080	trying to achieve a particular anatomical structure.
783080	784840	One thing we know is that development
784840	787280	is incredibly robust and reliable,
787280	788560	but it is not hardwired.
788560	791200	So if I cut an early embryo in half,
791200	792720	I don't get two half bodies.
792720	795600	I get two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.
795600	799000	And so there's this notion of different starting states
799000	801400	being able to lead to the same goal state,
801440	804720	this ensemble in morphospace that we equate
804720	806960	to a normal target morphology,
806960	810400	and they can avoid certain local minimum.
810400	813240	Here's an example that we discovered some years ago.
813240	816400	This is a tappel here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain.
816400	818240	And tappels need to become frogs.
818240	819520	And in order to become frogs, they
819520	821080	have to rearrange their face.
821080	824800	So the eyes, the nostrils, everything has to move around.
824800	827240	And so it was thought that this was a hardwired process,
827240	829600	that every organ just moves in the right direction
829600	830800	the right amount.
830800	833640	What we decided to test that and to see
833640	836080	how much intelligence actually is there.
836080	838440	And so we created what we call Picasso tappels.
838440	839520	Everything is scrambled.
839520	841280	The eyes on the back of the head, the jaws are off
841280	843640	to the side, everything is kind of mixed around.
843640	845200	And what we found is that these tappels
845200	847240	become largely normal frogs.
847240	849240	Because in fact, genetics does not specify
849240	850480	hardwired rearrangements.
850480	852840	What it gives you is a problem-solving machine
852840	857040	where every organ now moves in novel, unexpected paths
857040	858200	to get to where it's going.
858200	860680	Sometimes it actually overshoots and has to come back.
860680	862640	But it'll stop when it's done.
862640	864920	So what you really have here is a machine
864920	867040	that can do a kind of error minimization scheme
867040	869400	and start off in different configurations,
869400	873560	but always get to that same place in morphospace.
873560	876200	And this is of course what happens in regeneration.
876200	877840	This guy is an axolotl.
877840	880040	They regenerate their legs, their eyes, their jaws,
880040	880760	and so on.
880760	882920	And you can amputate the limb anywhere.
882920	887120	And these cells will build exactly what's needed
887120	889520	until they get to a correct salamander limb
889520	890720	and then they stop.
890720	894040	This, of course, is the most amazing thing about this.
894040	895680	This process is that it stops.
895680	898560	When does it stop when a correct limb has been formed?
898560	900680	Individual cells don't know anything about what a limb is
900680	902360	or how many fingers you're supposed to have,
902360	903960	but the collective absolutely does.
903960	905440	And it can stop when you get there,
905440	907320	no matter where you started.
907320	910640	It goes beyond this process of problem-solving
910640	914640	goes beyond damage to an existing structure
914640	917320	to what I think of as a good example of really
917360	919760	basal, creative problem-solving.
919760	921240	And it looks like this.
921240	925880	This is a cross-section of a kidney tubule in a nut.
925880	928880	And so usually about eight to 10 cells work together
928880	931160	to create these little tubules.
931160	933920	But if you artificially make the cells very large,
933920	935240	so this is different than damage.
935240	938200	This is not something that normally happens in evolution.
938200	940040	Nuts lose their arms all the time,
940040	941960	but this is quite different.
941960	944640	We've artificially made these cells to be gigantic.
944640	947480	And so what happens is then fewer of them get together
947480	950360	and they make the exact same size lumen.
950360	952680	And the most remarkable thing is that you can make these cells
952680	955320	truly enormous, and the way you do this, by the way,
955320	956320	is you make them polyploid.
956320	959680	So they have multiple copies of their genetic material,
959680	961600	and so the cells get bigger and bigger.
961600	965480	And in that case, one single cell will wrap around itself
965480	967160	and give you the whole lumen.
967160	969400	What's amazing about this example is a couple of things.
969400	973120	Number one, scaling of number to size,
973120	974800	so you can wrap your head around that.
974800	977280	But what's happening here is a completely different molecular
977280	977960	mechanism.
977960	979600	Instead of cell to cell communication,
979600	981680	you're now using cytoskeletal bending.
981680	985080	So this is a good example of top-down causation,
985080	988600	where in the service of a particular anatomical goal,
988600	990400	different molecular mechanisms will
990400	993600	get called up to solve the problem,
993600	995200	to give you the same outcome.
995200	996480	And the second cool thing about this
996480	1000240	is that this is really an example of unreliable hardware.
1000240	1002680	As an embryo, you can't count on how many
1002680	1004600	copies of your genetic material you have.
1004600	1007640	You can't count on what the size of your cells are going to be.
1007640	1010000	You have to figure out how to get the job done,
1010000	1013600	despite massive amounts of novelty, injuries, uncertainty,
1013600	1015640	and your own parts and in the environment.
1015640	1020360	So this is very basal kind of collective problem solving.
1020360	1022080	And how does all this happen?
1022080	1023080	How can they do this?
1023080	1026360	And so amazingly, or maybe looking backwards,
1026360	1029760	not so amazingly, it happens using the same mechanisms
1029800	1033200	that the nervous system uses to perform these functions.
1033200	1034800	So I don't have to tell anybody here
1034800	1036360	what the hardware and software looks like,
1036360	1040400	but this idea of ion channels setting up various states
1040400	1043480	that then drive the physiology that
1043480	1048520	is thought to underlie various aspects of cognition
1048520	1049960	and consciousness.
1049960	1053120	And neuroscience has this project of neural decoding,
1053120	1055280	where we're going to try to read all of these things
1055280	1058000	and infer what the creature is thinking,
1058000	1059920	remembering, experiencing, and so on.
1059920	1064560	So the kind of salient effect here
1064560	1068840	is that this system did not arise when brains and neurons came
1068840	1069360	on the scene.
1069360	1071640	This is evolutionarily ancient.
1071640	1074640	And even back at the time of bacterial biofilms,
1074640	1076360	through the work of Goral Sol, we now
1076360	1078800	know that even back then, already evolution
1078800	1082120	was using electrically-based computations
1082120	1084240	to coordinate across space and time
1084240	1088280	and to drive specific goal states from collective systems.
1088280	1092600	And so what we've done is now develop
1092600	1096080	some of the first tools that are able to read and write
1096080	1097800	this kind of electrical information out
1097800	1099360	of non-neural tissues.
1099360	1101520	So we want to do exactly what neuroscientists try
1101520	1105000	to do in the brain, but we look at other unconventional
1105000	1108600	intelligences solving problems in anatomical morphospace.
1108600	1113880	And so this is a voltage map of a time lapse of a frog embryo
1113880	1116160	organizing its primary axes.
1116160	1118720	And we can literally, using these voltage-sensitive dyes,
1118720	1121720	we can see, interpret, and modify
1121720	1124320	all of the integrated information
1124320	1126000	and all the communication that goes on
1126000	1128960	to enable them to reach collective goals.
1128960	1132160	And so it's a very parallel system, very much the way
1132160	1136400	that the bioelectrical events in the brain
1136400	1138640	are controlling muscles to move you
1138640	1140600	through three-dimensional space.
1140600	1142680	This more ancient system is using
1142680	1145280	bioelectrical events elsewhere in the body, right,
1145280	1149480	from the moment of fertilization to control all of the cells
1149480	1152840	to move the configuration of the body through morphospace.
1152840	1153720	It's the same thing.
1153720	1155720	And what we think evolution does is basically pivot
1155720	1158840	the same set of tricks across various spaces.
1158840	1161560	And so what we can do is we can, of course, we can image this.
1161560	1164240	And so this is, again, voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes.
1164240	1168400	This is a video of a frog embryo putting its face together.
1168400	1169840	And this is one frame.
1169840	1175680	And long before the genes and the anatomical rearrangements
1175680	1178840	of the cells begin to form the frog face,
1178840	1181280	you can already read out this pre-pattern.
1181280	1183000	Here's you, and I'm showing you this one
1183000	1184440	because it's the easiest one to decode.
1184440	1187440	We have others that are a real bear to make sense of.
1187440	1188840	But this one is pretty obvious.
1188840	1190080	Here's the animal's right eye.
1190080	1190760	Here's the mouth.
1190760	1191840	Here are the placodes.
1191840	1196080	You can already read the pattern memory in this tissue
1196080	1199480	that is going to guide the collective activity of the cells
1199480	1203640	to be able to reach that normal frog target morphology.
1203640	1205040	And so this is the normal pattern.
1205040	1206720	This pattern is required for development.
1206720	1209760	If I perturb this memory, I'll show you in a minute
1209760	1211360	what you get.
1211360	1213280	This is a pathological example.
1213280	1215640	So this is a human oncogene that's
1215640	1219280	going to basically cause the cells ultimately
1219280	1221720	to electrically disconnect from their neighbors,
1221720	1224360	roll back to a unicellular lifestyle,
1224360	1226160	and their cognitive light cone shrinks
1226160	1229520	from that of a large organ down to individual cells.
1229520	1231080	And now, as far as they're concerned,
1231080	1233200	the rest of the body is just external environment.
1233200	1235120	They're no longer part of this collective,
1235120	1238080	and that's tumor genesis and metastasis.
1238080	1240240	And you can detect this quite readily, this shift.
1240240	1242360	You can actually see it happening now.
1242360	1244160	So the way we manipulate these things,
1244160	1247200	we don't use any kind of electrodes
1247200	1250040	or applied magnetic fields or anything like that.
1250040	1252840	We use the native interface that the cells are normally
1252880	1255160	using to control each other's behavior
1255160	1258720	and link up into this larger scale intelligence that's
1258720	1262880	able to move in morphospace and other spaces like that.
1262880	1265920	So what that means is we can target these gap junctions,
1265920	1267040	these electrical synapses.
1267040	1270680	We can control the voltage states directly
1270680	1272720	using optogenetics, using drugs that
1272720	1274920	open and close these channels.
1274920	1276680	We can control the neurotransmitter movement
1276680	1278080	through these networks.
1278080	1281680	All the same familiar tools of neuroscience
1281680	1283760	really do not distinguish between neural tissue
1283760	1284480	and other tissues.
1284480	1285200	Everything works.
1285200	1287000	The tools work, the concepts work.
1287000	1289880	Everything is readily portable, and so that's what we do.
1289880	1291120	So I want to show you an example,
1291120	1294240	and this is just one of many examples of what happens.
1294240	1295920	I showed you that electric face picture,
1295920	1298240	and one of the things there was an eye spot.
1298240	1300200	It was a particular pattern of voltage
1300200	1301400	that corresponds to an eye.
1301400	1304720	And we said, what happens if we recreate that same pattern
1304720	1306200	memory somewhere else in the body?
1306200	1309280	And so what we did was we injected ion channel RNA
1309280	1310720	encoding a potassium channel that
1310760	1312880	sets that particular voltage state.
1312880	1313600	We encoded it.
1313600	1315840	We stuck it in some cells that are normally
1315840	1317280	going to be gut here.
1317280	1318600	So this is endoderm.
1318600	1320840	And when you do that, those cells
1320840	1322560	are happily enough make an eye.
1322560	1324720	And this eye has all the right lens, and retina,
1324720	1326640	and optic nerve, and all of that stuff.
1326640	1328800	Many things we could say about that.
1328800	1331120	One of the most interesting things about it
1331120	1335120	is that very much like the kind of scaling
1335120	1337400	that you see in other collective intelligences,
1337400	1339000	it has the following property.
1339440	1342600	This is a lens sitting out in the tail of a tadpole somewhere.
1342600	1345880	The blue cells are the ones that we actually injected.
1345880	1348200	But there's not enough of them to make a proper eye.
1348200	1349080	And they know this.
1349080	1350960	And what they've done is they've recruited
1350960	1353200	a bunch of their neighbors, these unmarked,
1353200	1355520	because they were not directly modified by us,
1355520	1358080	cells to participate in this eye building project.
1358080	1359520	So what's happening here is these are all
1359520	1361080	native competencies of the tissue.
1361080	1363040	We didn't have to do size control.
1363040	1364880	We didn't have to tell them how to build an eye,
1364880	1367880	what all the different gene expressions and cell types.
1367880	1368880	We have to do any of that.
1368920	1372840	We put in a very simple prompt or stimulus,
1372840	1374120	build an eye here.
1374120	1376800	And all the stuff that's downstream of that,
1376800	1379240	including the way ants recruit their neighbors
1379240	1381440	when they have a task that's too big for them,
1381440	1383080	all of that works.
1383080	1386040	And so we're starting to see some of these properties
1386040	1388800	and how to interface with them in the body.
1388800	1390720	And one of the most important things
1390720	1394600	is the ability to literally rewrite these pattern memories.
1394600	1396880	So this is a planarian, these flatworms.
1396880	1398460	The most amazing thing about them
1398500	1400220	is that you can cut them into pieces.
1400220	1401900	And if I cut off the head and the tail,
1401900	1404180	this middle fragment 100% of the time
1404180	1406580	regenerates into a nice one-headed worm.
1406580	1407540	So you can ask the question,
1407540	1409940	how does it know how many heads it's supposed to have?
1409940	1412140	And if you actually look at the bioelectrical pattern,
1412140	1416180	you see this interesting pattern that says one head, one tail.
1416180	1418380	And what we can do now is we can rewrite that pattern.
1418380	1419220	This is kind of messy.
1419220	1421340	The technology is still being worked on.
1421340	1423660	But you can see what we've done is we've said two heads.
1423660	1426820	And if you cut this animal, now you get a two-headed worm.
1426820	1427780	And this is not Photoshop.
1428260	1429340	These are real animals.
1429340	1431780	Now, notice something very interesting.
1431780	1434700	This bioelectrical map that is the map of this
1434700	1439500	perfectly normal anatomical structure, one-headed creature.
1439500	1441460	The gene expression is in the right place.
1441460	1442900	The anatomy is in the right place.
1442900	1445380	What we've changed is the internal representation
1445380	1447700	of what a correct planarian looks like.
1447700	1449940	And they stay normal until you injure them.
1449940	1453340	If you injure them, then all the cells consult this pattern
1453340	1455820	and they end up building this different pattern.
1455820	1458180	So that question that I asked at the very beginning,
1458180	1460940	how do the regenerating cells know what to make?
1460940	1464460	They literally store a memory of where in morphospace
1464460	1465540	they're supposed to go.
1465540	1467260	That memory is rewritable.
1467260	1471300	And you can think of this as a very primitive precursor
1471300	1478300	to our amazing mental time travel capacities
1478300	1480780	being able to imagine things that haven't happened yet
1480780	1483140	and remember things that are not happening now.
1483140	1485180	Because this bioelectrical pattern
1485180	1487020	is not a map of this two-headed creature.
1487020	1490620	This is a map of this perfectly normal one-headed animal.
1490620	1493540	So a single planarian body is able to store at least
1493540	1495460	two different representations of what
1495460	1497180	a correct planarian is supposed to look like.
1497180	1498660	And I'm sure there's lots more.
1498660	1501100	But this is the one we've nailed down.
1501100	1505260	So it's a very primitive example of a counterfactual memory.
1505260	1508460	What would I build if I were to be cut at a future time?
1508460	1509860	Not what's going on right now.
1509860	1512540	What's going on right now is this, one head, one tail.
1512540	1513700	Now, I keep calling it a memory.
1513700	1514220	Why is that?
1514220	1516060	Because it has all the properties of memory.
1516060	1518660	So if I take these two-headed animals, which, by the way,
1518660	1520460	are genetically perfectly normal.
1520460	1523660	So the question of what sets the number of heads
1523660	1525700	in the planarium is not very simple.
1525700	1528100	It's not that the answer is non-genetics.
1528100	1529620	Because if I take this two-headed animal
1529620	1531700	with a perfectly wild type genome,
1531700	1533300	I can cut him again and again.
1533300	1535940	And in perpetuity, he will continue
1535940	1539020	to regenerate as two-headed forms until we set him back.
1539020	1542060	We know how to rewrite it back to the one-headed state.
1542060	1543860	And so this question of how many heads
1543860	1547020	are supposed to be formed, that memory of where do you
1547020	1549100	go in morphospace to the one-headed region
1549100	1552100	or the two-headed region, is stored physiologically,
1552100	1552940	not genetically.
1552940	1554580	It is long-term stable.
1554580	1555700	It is rewritable.
1555700	1558900	I showed you the latency a minute ago, conditional recall,
1558900	1560780	and it has discrete behaviors.
1560780	1563420	And here you can see what these two-headed guys do
1563420	1566060	in terms of when they're hanging out.
1566060	1568700	So not only can we control head shape this way
1568700	1572020	by putting these literally false memories
1572020	1576260	into this collective agent, we can actually think about,
1576260	1579460	as well, we can actually think about head shape.
1579460	1581380	So whereas normally, the species would
1581380	1583180	make a triangular head shape, if we
1583180	1586660	perturb the network topology, while it's
1586660	1591700	regenerating just for 48 hours, they can make these normal heads.
1591700	1595300	But they can also make round heads like an S-Mediterranean
1595300	1596900	or flat heads like a Pifelina.
1596900	1599260	These are other species of planaria.
1599260	1602860	They are, again, genetically untouched,
1602860	1605940	but there's about 100 million years of genetic distance
1605940	1607540	between these animals.
1607540	1610980	And so this, of course, includes the shape of the brain,
1610980	1612260	the distribution of stem cells.
1612260	1614340	They become just like these other animals.
1614340	1617820	And so the same exact hardware can be pushed
1617820	1621580	to visit other regions of that morphospace.
1621580	1624500	This is very much like behavior in three-dimensional space.
1624500	1626460	The hardware can learn many different things.
1626460	1628860	It doesn't always do the same thing.
1628860	1631380	And of course, you can get them to hallucinate
1631380	1635140	kinds of morphologies that are not even
1635140	1637020	typical for any species of planaria,
1637020	1639220	such as the spiky forms, cylindrical forms,
1639220	1640660	and sort of combinations.
1640660	1642700	So the exact same hardware can be pushed
1642700	1645740	into lots of different domains.
1645740	1647300	And so for the last couple of minutes,
1647300	1649620	I just want to show you one thing.
1649620	1653540	We were just talking about this anatomical morphospace
1653540	1656500	and the different shapes that are there and the species that
1656500	1660140	naturally know how to get to particular regions
1660140	1664780	and then how you push other types of implementations
1664780	1665900	into those regions.
1665900	1669000	But what does the space of possibilities
1669000	1670980	look like for totally new beings?
1670980	1673740	So let's make something that has not existed on Earth
1673740	1675340	before and see what happens.
1675340	1678540	So this is a project that we did with Josh Bongard's lab
1678540	1679620	at the University of Vermont.
1679620	1681540	And Doug Blackeston did all the biology
1681540	1682980	that I'm showing you here.
1682980	1684700	So this is an early frog embryo.
1684740	1688460	At this stage, we take the animal-cap ectoderm.
1688460	1689100	This is skin.
1689100	1691100	These are all of these cells are going to become skin.
1691100	1696820	We dissociate them, cut them away from the embryo,
1696820	1699420	dissociate them, and put them on their own.
1699420	1700420	They could do many things.
1700420	1701340	They could die.
1701340	1702300	They could spread out.
1702300	1704060	They could form a two-dimensional monolayer.
1704060	1705220	They could do nothing.
1705220	1709820	Instead, what they do is they gather together.
1709820	1714100	And over the next 24 hours, they're going to come together
1714140	1716940	and they're going to make this little interesting thing,
1716940	1718180	which we call a xenobot.
1718180	1720940	Xenobot because Xenopus laevis is the name of the frog,
1720940	1722780	and it's a biorebotics platform.
1722780	1725220	So the interesting thing is that the frog genome certainly
1725220	1726220	knows how to make this.
1726220	1727700	This is what we typically see, and this
1727700	1730060	is what we typically think the frog genome encodes,
1730060	1733300	a set of developmental stages, and then some behaviors.
1733300	1735460	But they can also encode this.
1735460	1737740	This is a xenobot, and it has its own interesting
1737740	1740060	developmental sequence.
1740060	1742860	It's never been seen before, and it has interesting behaviors.
1742860	1743900	What are the behaviors?
1743900	1745660	Well, the first thing these things do
1745660	1749020	is they repurpose their little cilia, the little hairs that
1749020	1751540	normally redistribute mucus down the body of the frog,
1751540	1752740	and they start to swim.
1752740	1753940	And they can go in circles.
1753940	1756140	They can go back and forth like this.
1756140	1757380	They have collective behaviors.
1757380	1759020	They have individual behaviors.
1759020	1760620	Here's one navigating a maze.
1760620	1763140	So you can see here, remember, there's no nervous system.
1763140	1765420	This is just skin.
1765420	1766780	It takes the corner without having
1766780	1768340	to bump into the opposite wall.
1768340	1771540	And then here, for no reason that we understand yet,
1771540	1774300	it has the spontaneous change of heart,
1774300	1777540	and it turns around and goes back where it comes from.
1777540	1780380	So these are spontaneously, motile organisms
1780380	1782700	that have different behaviors.
1782700	1784540	Here's one amazing behavior.
1784540	1787860	If you provide them with loose skin cells,
1787860	1791100	they will run around and collect those skin cells
1791100	1792380	into little piles.
1792380	1794220	They will compact them like this.
1794220	1796660	And because they're dealing with an agential material that
1796660	1799780	is not passive particles but cells,
1799780	1802700	these little piles mature into xenobots themselves,
1802700	1803940	and that's the next generation.
1803940	1804580	And guess what they do?
1804580	1806140	They go on and they do the exact same thing,
1806140	1808140	producing the next generation than the next.
1808140	1809940	This is called kinematic self-replication.
1809940	1813260	No other animal on Earth, to our knowledge, does this.
1813260	1817900	This is completely novel with this kind of construction.
1817900	1820220	And so they don't have neurons, but they
1820220	1822340	do have a lot of calcium spiking.
1822340	1824140	And you can imagine doing all of the things
1824140	1826260	that neuroscientists do with looking
1826260	1828900	for transferentropy and mutual information,
1828900	1831340	all these kinds of things.
1831340	1833460	So we can ask, what do the cells say to each other?
1833460	1835860	What do two xenobots say to each other?
1835860	1838700	We don't know their cognitive capacities.
1838700	1839900	We're investigating that now.
1839900	1840700	What can they learn?
1840700	1841820	What are their preferences?
1841820	1844380	Really important that we can't make armchair claims about this.
1844380	1845980	This has to be empirical studies.
1845980	1848980	So I'm just going to end here with two slides
1848980	1853860	to say that because biology has to solve all these problems
1853860	1856060	every time that a being arises into the swirl.
1856060	1857620	It has to set its boundaries, figure out
1857620	1859780	what the effectors are, what the sensors are.
1859780	1862060	And nothing can really be assumed.
1862060	1863860	It's so interoperable that pretty much
1863860	1867380	any combination of evolved material at any scale,
1867380	1871420	designed material, and software, is some kind of agent.
1871420	1874340	And people are already making cyborgs and hybrids
1874340	1877740	and every possible combination, which has implications.
1877740	1879900	We are going to be living in the next few decades
1879900	1885180	in a huge option space of new bodies and new minds.
1885180	1887420	Darwin said endless forms are the most beautiful
1887420	1888660	about the natural forms.
1888660	1890980	They're a tiny corner of this space.
1890980	1892620	We're going to have to come up with ways
1892620	1895940	to relate to beings that are nowhere on our tree of life.
1895940	1897940	So these old criteria of what do you look like
1897940	1900980	and how did you get here are not going to be useful anymore.
1900980	1902940	And all of these binary categories
1902940	1905500	are going to wash away as well.
1905500	1908420	Because when people make claims about machines and robots
1908420	1911540	and organisms, it's just very difficult to support
1911540	1913980	any kind of clean separation.
1914020	1917740	I'm going to stop here and just summarize what I've
1917740	1922260	tried to say is that biological systems solve and operate
1922260	1924780	in all kinds of spaces.
1924780	1926780	They have behavioral competencies that
1926780	1929180	include memory and learning and problem solving,
1929180	1933260	navigation, representation, perceptible by stability,
1933260	1934940	active inference, and so on.
1934940	1936780	The underlying mechanisms are also the same.
1936780	1939980	They use ion channels, electrical synapses, neurotransmitters,
1939980	1941460	microtubules, electric fields.
1941460	1943740	All of that is present in all of the structures
1944100	1945100	of bodies.
1945100	1946580	And if these are the kinds of things
1946580	1948980	that we think are associated with consciousness,
1948980	1951620	we have to take very seriously the possibility
1951620	1953180	that there are other unconventional
1953180	1956020	consciousnesses in our bodies and increasingly
1956020	1960420	being made by engineering kinds of efforts.
1960420	1964780	And to me, just taking a step back of how
1964780	1967500	we think about these things, all agency claims
1967500	1970740	are really protocol claims for how you can optimally relate
1970740	1971780	to that system.
1971780	1975260	And so as an engineer, I want to guess correctly
1975260	1978300	for various systems is where I am on this spectrum.
1978300	1980220	But of course, it's not just about engineering.
1980220	1981860	It's also about relationships.
1981860	1985100	And people are trying to develop sort of proof of humanity
1985100	1986420	certificates and so on.
1986420	1988820	And the question then becomes, what do you really
1988820	1990300	want when you have proof of humanity?
1990300	1992780	Are you looking for proof of native DNA?
1992780	1995340	Are you looking for proof of native anatomical structure
1995340	1997900	or something that we explore here, which is really
1997900	2000820	a kind of competency for compassion that maybe that's
2000820	2001900	the more important thing?
2001900	2003580	And this is an example.
2003580	2005140	Midjourney is an AI system that I
2005140	2009740	asked to draw its vision of two synthetic organisms in love.
2009740	2011900	And this is what it drew.
2011900	2016140	So if anybody's interested, especially these two papers
2016140	2018660	are relevant, but there's a whole bunch of work on this.
2018660	2021700	And I want to thank all the people who
2021700	2023060	did the work that I showed you today
2023060	2026620	and all our many collaborators, of course, and our funders.
2026620	2027700	And I thank you for listening.
2030820	2031820	Thank you.
