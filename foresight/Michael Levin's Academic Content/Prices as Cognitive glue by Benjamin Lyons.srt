1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
So this is going to be conceptually pretty similar to what we talked about last time,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,840
but it's a little more condensed and focused onto just the core price economics are the absolute

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,360
basics of understanding the economics of collective intelligence. And so I'm just going

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,840
to basically go through it. It's fairly dry and abstract, but the idea is if you can understand

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,120
everything in this talk, then you've got the bare minimum. And anytime you want to jump in,

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,280
just feel free. And we'll just go through it. It's about 20 or so slides. It should take about

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,720
half an hour. And then we can discuss for the rest of the time. Great. Yeah, go for it. Fantastic.

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,720
Cool. So this is a talk of prices as cognitive glue and introduction to the economics of

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,880
collective intelligence. So here are our goals. Our primary goal is to learn the bare minimum

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,280
economics for understanding the general abstract principles of collective intelligence.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,520
So there's a couple of things going on there. First, regarding bare minimum. So obviously,

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,000
I don't know a lot about biology, but I do know some absolute basics. I have a basic concept of

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,360
what a cell is, a basic concept of what DNA is. And this is helpful for understanding your work.

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,960
Similarly, what this presentation should do is give you the absolute bare minimum for understanding

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,360
the basic economics of collective intelligence. If you can basically grasp everything in this

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,640
presentation, then you should be good to go. And regarding the abstract side of things. So biology

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,960
is very useful for understanding collective intelligence because it lets you see concretely

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,200
that, you know, you start as a single cell, you're just physics and there's no magical transition

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,600
where you become like a real intelligence or something like that. Economics allows us to do

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,920
the complete opposite where it naturally gives us a bird's eye view and we can see the whole forest

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,760
without having to navigate through all the trees. And so that's going to bring in the other side of

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,800
this and having the concrete and the abstract is going to be very powerful. So specifically,

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,920
we're going to understand three ideas. The first is that economic production, even building something

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,560
as simple as a pencil, is actually incredibly complicated. You have to coordinate across millions

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,760
of people, dozens of countries and tens of years. You obviously need some way of managing that.

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,320
The way that gets managed is through the price system. The price system is the cognitive glue

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,720
that makes this possible by connecting people across space and time. And mostly what we're

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,920
going to be focused on is how the price system works within emphasis on the idea that prices

29
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,000
erase the distinction between other people, stresses and rewards and your own, turning one

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,760
person's problem into everyone's problem. And so the hypothesis backgrounding this talk, which I

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,080
cannot prove, but I think is quite plausible, is that all collective intelligences work according

32
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,560
to the same basic economic principles. So on the surface, they might seem very different, like a

33
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,520
cell versus a person versus an economy. But I think underneath the hood, it's all just the same

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,400
economics. So let's get into it. So let's talk about making a pencil. This is a very familiar

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,360
object, which we're hopefully all familiar with. This down here is a little diagram of what happens

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,600
once you've got a nice block of wood. And it seems very easy, you know, you cut down a tree,

37
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,360
you, you know, sort of divide up the wood into these slats, you slide some graphite in,

38
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,840
you glue the slats back together, then you, you know, dice it up, and you attach some brass and

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,720
rubber at the end, and you get some nice lettering for Dixon, Ticonderoga, who are not sponsoring

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,760
this, but just a little free advertising. So it seems very easy to do. But in reality, making a

41
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,240
pencil actually requires an immense degree of coordination. That seems virtually impossible

42
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,720
once you start breaking it down. So to chop down a tree, you need a saw. So to make a saw, you need

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,960
some ore, and these are going to be in different places. So maybe your trees in like Oregon,

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,680
but your ores in like West Virginia. So all of a sudden you're on like opposite sides of the country.

45
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,640
And so then you need refining processes to take that ore and make it into steel and manufacturing

46
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,800
processes to take that steel and turn it into saws and helmets and so forth. And just as you

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,120
keep iterating, it grows like this. All of these processes are very complex. They take a lot of

48
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,840
people, a lot of training, a lot of knowledge, and somehow all of it has to come together

49
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,960
in a very complicated way. And this isn't just true for chopping down trees, but it's true for

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,680
the graphite, the brass, et cetera. All of the elements of a pencil are very complicated to

51
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,160
actually acquire. And each and every one of them requires an immense degree of coordination. And

52
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,360
not only are they individually very complex, but they all have to come together at the same point

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,560
in space and time so that you can actually combine it into a pencil. So they all need to be coordinated

54
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,360
with each other. And in the modern age, these processes don't even exist in the same country.

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,840
So you might have manufacturing in China, wood from Brazil, your rubber from Mexico, et cetera.

56
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,040
These processes take years to complete and they're not on any kind of shared timetable. So managing

57
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,320
this process seems incredibly complex. And you have to manage it without a pencil because you

58
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,400
haven't built a pencil yet. So you can't even write things down. So the question is, how are you

59
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,720
able to do this? And what's most incredible about this process is that the degree of coordination

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,080
necessary is achieved with so much robustness and reliability. But I can take this incredible

61
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,560
pencil, which we now know takes millions of people and decades to produce. I can snap in a half and

62
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,440
nobody cares because these pencils are so widely available. The system works so well that its outputs

63
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,640
are entirely unremarkable. And you can easily predict that you're going to have access to them.

64
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,360
So there has to be some kind of system managing everything. We obviously can't leave this up

65
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,360
to random chance. And whatever that managing system is, it seems reasonable to call it intelligence

66
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,680
because it does what we expect intelligence to do, which is to navigate around obstacles to

67
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,760
reach a goal space. So like when COVID-19 broke out, you didn't rush to the store to buy a bunch of

68
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,640
pencils because you knew there would be pencils if you ever needed one. One hypothesis is that

69
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,880
there might just be a set of instructions in the economy somewhere telling everyone what to do.

70
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,320
But in economics, there is nothing analogous to DNA where we might think a set of instructions are

71
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,200
hiding. There are just R-no instructions full stop. So then we've got to really figure out

72
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,840
how is this possible? And the answer to that is the price system. So this is going to be our

73
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,320
primary focus for this talk is just the basics of how the price system works. So this is the

74
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,560
famous supply and demand graph. This is going to be the supply and demand for pencils. All the

75
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,240
numbers are made up just to illustrate. And so the basic way this graph works is on our y-axis,

76
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,120
we have the price of pencils. And on the x-axis, we have the quantity of pencils. And the graph

77
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,800
is done backwards for historical reasons. So the y-axis is going to be our independent variable.

78
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,080
The x-axis is our dependent variable. So quantity is a function of price. And we've got our two

79
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,720
curves here, our demand curve in red and our supply curve in green. And how each of these

80
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,360
curves work is, first of all, the demand curve is the sum of everyone's plans to buy pencils

81
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,760
at every price point. So how this curve is constructed, if you could just like peer inside

82
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,200
everyone's mind, what you would do is you would say, okay, at a price of five dollars,

83
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,520
how many pencils does everyone plan to buy? And the total amount of that is the market

84
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,160
demand for pencils at five dollars. Then you just iterate down. So the demand curve slopes down,

85
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,440
because as the price goes down, people, of course, want to buy more. So the price goes down and the

86
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,040
quantity goes up as we shift out to the right. And then the supply curve is the same in the

87
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,720
other direction. It is the sum of everyone's plans to sell pencils at every price. So you do

88
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,360
the same thing. You just take the total amount of pencils that everyone plans to sell at each price.

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,840
And the supply curve is going to slope up because as the price goes up, people naturally want to

90
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,040
sell more pencils and make more money. And there's one special point here, the equilibrium point for

91
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,240
supply and demand intersect. This is the point where everyone's plans match up. No one is trying

92
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,720
to sell a pencil that can't be sold or buy a pencil that can't be bought. So you can see

93
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,360
that the quantity of supply and the quantity of demand are the same at this equilibrium point.

94
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,280
And this right here, it's a very simple graph, but I think it actually does illustrate the basic

95
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,360
concept of how you could have a system that could build a pencil and how you could have a system

96
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,080
that's a collective intelligence, because if you can arrange a system so that everyone's plans are

97
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,440
mutually consistent, or even in the limit, if everyone has the same plan, that's the key to

98
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,640
large-scale coordination. Everyone is going to be naturally working together rather than conflicting

99
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,360
or at odds with each other. One final thing to notice is that the reasons behind the plans

100
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,160
don't matter, your goals stay private. So why you might want to buy a pencil or why you might want

101
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,920
to sell a pencil, none of that matters. So maybe you want to write something down, maybe you're

102
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,720
making pencil art, it doesn't matter. Like this system works for any kind of plans, any kind of

103
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,200
goals, it doesn't need that information. Given your plans, which only you need to know, it's

104
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,960
able to coordinate everyone regardless. So this is the basic concept of how prices enable this

105
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,640
sort of large-scale coordination. But the question is, why would an individual be interested in

106
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,400
participating in this system? It's good for the collective, is it good for the individual?

107
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,160
And the answer is yes, because prices help you plan. So to plan effectively, you need to know how

108
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,240
available one resource is relative to another. Like if you want to eat fruit and you're thinking

109
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,200
if I want an apple or an orange, you need to know how available are apples relative to oranges.

110
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,280
If they're very available, they're probably easier to get, and so you'll have to give up less time

111
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,200
and less energy to acquire one. Maybe you like the other one more, but you need to know how the

112
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,440
trade-off works. So what economists say is that when a resource is less available, it is more scarce,

113
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,320
and the scarcity of one resource relative to another is called relative scarcity. And the

114
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,280
brilliant thing about prices is that prices track relative scarcity. So when people plan to buy more

115
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,760
of something, which is demand, or plan to sell less of that, which is supply, the resource becomes

116
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,640
less available and therefore more scarce. And so by planning on price, you can plan based on

117
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,600
scarcity. So it would be hard for you as an individual to figure out how available are apples

118
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,280
relative to oranges, but it's very easy for you to figure out how costly, what's the price of

119
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,520
apples relative to oranges, because you can just go to the store and see that. And just to see that

120
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,040
in this graph here. So this is our original equilibrium point that we saw previously, where

121
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,600
they supply and demand curve intersects. So if demand goes up, it now intersects here. So the

122
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,480
price is higher, or if supply goes down, it intersects here. So again, the price is higher.

123
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,280
So when things become more scarce, because people are trying to use it more or make it less available,

124
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,000
the price goes up. And similarly, if the demand were to go down or supply would go up, that would

125
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,160
make it more available and therefore cheaper. So prices naturally track relative scarcity,

126
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,480
which is what you need to know. And the elegance of this system is that you can plan based on your

127
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,960
budget. So you have an amount of money, let's just say like $100 or something, you can naturally

128
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,520
combine that budget with the existing set of prices that you can easily observe at the store

129
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,600
to tell you every possible bundle of resources you can purchase, right? It's all just,

130
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,520
at that point, very elementary linear algebra. You can just see all the combinations you can buy.

131
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,600
So at that point, it's just up to you and your competencies to pick the best of all available

132
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,480
combinations of resources that you want to purchase, which is in fact, what intelligence is all about.

133
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,800
You have a lot of alternative ways of achieving a goal state, and you're trying to pick the best

134
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,200
one. And the price system makes that very easy. You just say, how much money do I have? How much

135
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,720
does everything cost? And that really simplifies the problem. And so if equilibrium prices actually

136
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,120
do reflect relative scarcities, then that allows you as an individual to confidently choose your

137
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,240
favorite available bundle of resources, secure in the knowledge that your plan will not conflict

138
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,560
with other people's plans, as long as the prices are in fact accurate. And we'll talk about what

139
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,760
happens when they're not. So what happens if plants are wrong? So we know that the price

140
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,160
should be at this equilibrium point where they intersect so that what everyone wants to do

141
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,240
is consistent with what everyone else wants to do. What happens if the price is too high?

142
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,800
Let's say it's at $4 here. What we can see by going over to the right here is that the demand

143
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,320
for pencils people want to buy or plan to buy, about 20 of them, and people plan to sell about

144
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,040
30 of them. So what this means is that sellers are going to have this issue where they're planning to

145
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,120
sell all these pencils and they're going to use that money to do other things, and no one's going

146
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,760
to buy these pencils because they're too expensive. So you're going to have an issue where people can't

147
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,680
accomplish their plans. And similarly, if the price is too low, it's a $2, sellers want to sell

148
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,320
maybe only 16 or so, but buyers want to buy about 35. So you're going to have an issue,

149
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,480
this creates what economists call a shortage. Everyone wants to buy a pencil and there just

150
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,200
literally aren't enough for everyone to accomplish their plan. So the systems and conflict people's

151
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,920
plans aren't consistent with each other. And that makes it difficult to achieve allostasis.

152
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,920
So there, this is really matters in real life. It's not just abstract graphs. So this is an image

153
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,760
of the famous 1970s gas lines. I don't know if this is something you necessarily, yeah, but so this

154
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,080
is hopefully a familiar image to some people. And you can see what this issue was in the 1970s.

155
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,120
The price of gasoline was kept too low. There were some price controls on it. And so people were

156
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,320
seeing low prices and planning to buy a lot of gas, but people weren't planning to sell a lot of gas.

157
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,640
And so you had these issues where people were waiting in line for hours to buy gas,

158
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,920
and then often they couldn't even buy gas because the place had run out. So when you get the price

159
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,720
wrong, you really do have this issue where people's plans are in conflict with each other. Not everyone

160
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,040
can accomplish their goals simultaneously. And the system really gets jammed up in a very physical

161
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,880
way because people are trying to do things that don't make sense based on what other people are

162
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,200
trying to do. So we know why it's useful for prices to reach equilibrium, but why would they reach

163
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,040
equilibrium? And the answer is simply because of people's self-interest. So if you're a seller

164
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,280
and you're trying to sell pencils, but the price is too high, you actually want to lower the price

165
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,200
so that you can make at least some money selling the pencils. You make zero money selling the pencils

166
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,480
for too high of a price. So sellers want to lower the price. And buyers, if the price is too low,

167
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,920
actually want to raise the price because if you're offering too low of a price,

168
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,000
the seller just won't sell to you. So you want to raise the price so you can get something. So

169
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,880
sellers are pushing the price down. Buyers are pushing the price up. And the only logical stopping

170
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,280
point is equilibrium. So just by people's natural self-interest, the price is going to be pushed

171
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,720
to the equilibrium point. And the basic idea here of what's going on is that your plans are

172
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,520
functions of other people's plans. And so to accomplish your plans, you need to make your plan

173
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,240
consistent with everyone else's plan, not because you care about them, but just because you're selfish.

174
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,640
And the price is the variable you can manipulate to make everyone's plans congruent with everyone

175
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,160
else's. So everyone's just naturally trying to bring things to equilibrium.

176
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,360
So what happens if there's a new stress? And this is really going to be kind of the key

177
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,680
section here. So let's say that you are writing something down and all of a sudden your pencil

178
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,480
breaks and you need to go buy a new one. If the system's in equilibrium, then as we saw,

179
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,720
every pencil plan to be sold is already planned to be bought. So there's not an easy way for you

180
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,080
to get a pencil based on existing prices. So what you need to do is bid up the price of pencils to

181
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,120
outcompete other buyers. You need to convince a seller to sell you a pencil by raising that price.

182
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,480
And so what we get is this diagram. So this was the old demand. And then because you want to buy

183
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,720
more pencils now, there's new demand based on your new plan. And there are two key facts about this.

184
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,880
One is you can see the intersection point, which is the equilibrium price has moved up.

185
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,960
And the quantity of pencils in the market has also gone up as well from about 25 to about 30 or so.

186
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,720
So price goes up and quantity goes up when you plan to buy more pencils.

187
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,080
And what this does is this is the stress sharing mechanic. So you bid up the price of pencils,

188
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,160
just because it helps you gives you better chances of acquiring a pencil. But because you're connected

189
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,440
to everyone else, the price system, this transmits your stress to them. So an increase in price

190
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,040
stresses out buyers, right? They see the higher price, they go, whoa, I was planning to buy a

191
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,000
bunch of pencils. Now that's harder to do. So I don't want to buy as many pencils, which is

192
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,040
exactly what you need. That leaves more pencils available for you. And similarly, an increase in

193
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,960
price excites sellers, they go, oh boy, I want to sell a bunch of pencils now and make money,

194
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,680
which again, makes more pencils available for you to buy. So just by bidding up the price of

195
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,720
pencils, you're communicating your stress to everybody without you necessarily even realizing

196
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,200
you're doing so it just happens anyway. And it looks like they're generously choosing to help

197
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,920
you out. But in reality, what's going on is they just can't tell is this stress mine or his. In fact,

198
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,200
they don't even know about you. So they're not even asking that question. They're just seeing

199
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,400
I'm stressed out. So I got to behave differently. And that takes care of you. And so this is the

200
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,520
diagram, right? So your stressed out price goes up, everyone stressed out. So if this diagram

201
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,080
makes intuitive sense at this point, then we basically accomplished the primary goal.

202
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,120
So what we can see is that prices achieve mind melding and the expansion of perceptual fields,

203
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,960
which is what we need for large scale collective intelligence. So as we've seen when you bid up

204
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,320
the price of a pencil, your stress becomes the buyer stress and the reward you would receive

205
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,840
from a pencil becomes the reward of sellers because they make more money. So we've got stress

206
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,720
sharing, we have reward sharing. And what this does is it causes perceptual fields to get bigger.

207
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,480
Everyone acts as if they know about your plans and they change their behavior to fit with what

208
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,280
you're doing just because the price went up. And this is basically what lets people make pencils.

209
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:37,040
The task of creating a pencil is too large for any one individual on their own to understand.

210
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,360
But because of the way that perceptual fields get expanded, everyone's able to see

211
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,120
what they need to see to make the system work. And one important thing as well is that the system

212
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,640
depends on competition among the subunits to achieve this cooperative outcome. So suppose a

213
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,600
pencil seller tries to cheat the system and pretend that there's a new stress in the economy and

214
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,080
raise the price of pencils to make more money. What this would immediately do is incentivize

215
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,800
all of the other pencil sellers to undercut them and steal their customers. So lying and

216
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,040
trying to cheat the system in some way, immediately you get punished by your competition, we're going

217
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,920
to take advantage of your poor decision to make more money. And so my hypothesis is that all

218
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,640
collective intelligence has worked this way. We're all bound together by cognitive blues,

219
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,960
such as bioelectricity that are in some way mathematically analogous to the price system.

220
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,760
I think there's one way to do this. It's this basic abstract economic system. So

221
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:36,000
what justifies calling this I think a collective intelligence is a shared model perspective.

222
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,880
So prices are a set of publicly available electronically transmitted numbers that condense

223
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,000
a huge amount of decentralized information, which means they constitute a model of relative

224
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,800
scarcities. And it's a shared model because we all see the same set of prices. And so if we just

225
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,640
think about like an active inference internal model thing, it seems like you can associate a

226
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,840
self to an internal model. So if everyone has the same model, then everyone's part of the same

227
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,200
self. So it's a collective intelligence. And what this enables to happen because everyone's

228
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,840
sharing the same model is everyone perceives the predictions and an active inference sense of the

229
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,720
expected perceptions and planned behaviors of everyone else, which makes it very easy to figure

230
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,520
out how to achieve your goals while not interfering with and therefore being interfered with by

231
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,920
other people's goals. So to return to the original question of how we're able to build a pencil,

232
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,800
this is the basic picture of how that works. So all of the facts necessary to coordinate people

233
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,200
across space and time are things that some individual is aware of. Maybe it's someone,

234
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,960
a worker on the ground, or a CEO high up in the company, but everyone has some piece of the puzzle

235
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,960
and they incorporate that piece of the puzzle into their plans because they're just that's what

236
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,920
people do. They take their information and they plan on that basis. Then those plans, as we've

237
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,880
seen through supply and demand, are condensed into prices such that updates to relevant information

238
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,240
cause updates to plans, which cause updates to prices. So this is this diagram. So information

239
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,560
causes plans, causes prices, and then changes in information yield changes in plans, which make

240
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,800
changes in prices. And so then all people have to do rather than having to think, how do I make

241
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,040
my information congruent with Mike's or how to make my plan congruent with his? All I need to do

242
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,200
is make my plan congruent with prices, which is easy to do because I know what the prices are,

243
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,000
and I know how much money I have, which then unwittingly makes my behavior congruent with your

244
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,920
behavior as well. And so the simple signaling system allows everyone, you know, in the US,

245
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,040
Mexico, Brazil, China, et cetera, to coordinate with each other without realizing they're doing so.

246
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,640
And fascinatingly, this causes a massive scaling of plans and goals. So an ordinary human on their

247
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,960
own just plans to like acquire food and shelter so they don't get eaten. But when you combine people

248
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,200
into the system, all of a sudden people start planning to create millions of commercial grade

249
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,960
pencils every year. So this system really scales up people's goals by making it highly attainable

250
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,760
to achieve those goals. One interesting note about this is that if you can prove that this

251
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,480
is how organisms work, then you would prove that cells are agents, because one obvious way to think

252
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,360
about agents is that agents are entities that take information and turn those agents, turn that

253
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,400
information into plans. So if you can see that the biological system is doing this, then the only

254
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,400
way to make sense that would be that cells are agents. So just a fun little note there. So one

255
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,360
important point as well. So we can see how helpful prices are to us. Why are they so helpful to us?

256
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,280
And the answer, of course, is their own self-interest. They're just trying to help themselves.

257
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,560
So the price system has two goals. It's to be an accurate model, and it's to be a rational model

258
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,720
of the relative scarcities of all goods. And I suspect that's the goal of all models to be

259
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,880
rational and accurate. So just a reminder, scarcity is the availability of a good relative to people's

260
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,080
plans. The more people plan to use it, the less of the more scarcities. Relative scarcity is the

261
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,720
scarcity of one good compared to the scarcity of another good. So what accuracy means in this

262
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,720
context is that if apples are priced twice as high as oranges, so if apples cost $2 and oranges cost

263
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,920
$1, then accuracy means that apples are actually twice as scarce as oranges. The prices really

264
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,720
are attracting the relative scarcities. And rationality just means rationality in the Bayesian

265
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,280
sense, like prices should update as a random walk, not moving in a predictable direction.

266
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,760
And the way we know prices have these goals is because they pay people to improve its accuracy

267
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,320
and rationality. If you're a stock trader or a commodity trader or something, and you can make

268
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,960
the system more accurate or make the system more rational, you can become very wealthy. So the price

269
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,080
system effectively pays us to make it more accurate and rational, which is exactly what we need in

270
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,880
turn to enable a large-scale coordination. So this takes us to a primary conclusion, and then we'll

271
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,000
have a couple of miscellaneous slides after. So what I think is the basic things you need to have

272
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,240
collective intelligence, and I think this should be a universal principle. You need some kind of

273
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,600
system that collects all relevant information and condenses it into a single shared set of

274
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,800
mathematically useful objects, like prices, which are numbers. Numbers are very convenient.

275
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,200
You want these objects to be something that interacts with the subunits of the collective,

276
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,920
such as the humans or the cells, whatever, such that they persuade people to behave in the intended

277
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,840
way, which then allow you to manipulate these prices or whatever other objects to get the

278
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,040
system to do anything it can conceivably do, as we'll see on the next slide. You need the system

279
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,160
to incorporate new and updated information and have that transmit rapidly and accurately through

280
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,760
the system, which is what the stock market does. You also need a process for inducing honesty and

281
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,360
accuracy in communicating information, such as competition. And the result of all of this needs

282
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,680
to be a shared model that is an accurate and rational model of relative scarcities,

283
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,560
relative scarcities being what sums up the congruences and conflicts between everyone's plans.

284
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,080
So if everyone can see something that models the relative scarcities,

285
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,320
everyone's going to be able to act in ways that are consistent with how everyone else is acting.

286
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,800
So this right here, I think, is the basic details any collective intelligence needs to

287
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:09,200
have and is going to have. So a few couple miscellaneous points here. So I'm arguing prices

288
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,920
are analogous to bioelectricity, which means they should be the morphological code of the economy,

289
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,280
and indeed they are. So this is an example I got off Twitter. So taxes are like an artificial way

290
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,520
of manipulating the price system. You can raise the price above what it would otherwise be.

291
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,160
And as we can see, if you tax windows, you don't get many windows. If you tax roofs,

292
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,080
you don't get many roofs. If you tax frontage, you don't get a lot of frontage.

293
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,120
And if you tax finished buildings, you don't get a lot of finished buildings.

294
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,600
So economists believe that in principle, you can get the economy to do anything that could

295
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,720
conceivably do just by manipulating the prices up and down, which is very convenient if all you

296
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,280
have to do is manipulate prices, because that leaves the problem solving up to the subunits.

297
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:55,600
So a high price says supply more of this and buy less of this, but how to supply more of it and how

298
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,400
to live with less of it is left up to the subunits and their competencies. So just as an example,

299
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,560
if you want less carbon dioxide in the air, as we all should, then you can just raise,

300
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,360
put a tax on carbon dioxide. And then the challenge of how to adjust to that new price

301
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,160
is left up to people's and businesses. So managing the system in principle is very easy,

302
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,760
as long as you can move prices up and down. And then the final point here is what if there's

303
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,760
a flaw in the system? What if there's a missing link? So the system works very well as long as

304
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,200
everything relevant is being tracked, accounted for, and condensed into the price system. But what

305
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,440
if there's something that doesn't get into the price system for whatever reason? Whatever that is,

306
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,480
it's called an externality. So an example is just, you know, carbon dioxide like we just saw,

307
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,280
it's not priced properly. So the effects of it aren't included in the price. So people end up

308
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,920
doing stuff they shouldn't do, like over consuming, like buying SUVs and things like that.

309
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,360
I believe that externality is analogous to cancer. Cancer is an example of externality.

310
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,560
So a firm producing excess pollution is doing so because that activity isn't tied to the rest of

311
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,600
the economy via the price system. So it treats the rest of the economy like the external environment

312
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,960
as something to dump waste into rather than to take care of. So I believe basically externality

313
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,160
explains economic tumors and relatedly, externality causes developmental disorders.

314
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,840
So if there's something like weird going on in the firm, that doesn't make sense. Or if the

315
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,080
economy is creating goods and services that it shouldn't create, that's always going to be because

316
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,560
of an externality. And externality is kind of my thing. So if externality interests you, check

317
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,520
out my paper on my website, the problem of externality in 2024 for more information about

318
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,760
how that works. That takes me to the end of this. Thank you very much for sitting through this.

319
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,520
Here's my contact information. And if this sort of theme interests you,

320
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,760
I have an essay on my website, Prices as Memories, which goes into more detail about

321
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,440
some of what's going on here. So thanks very much for sitting through that. I hope that was

322
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,120
interesting and educational. And I'll just turn it over to you now. What do you want to discuss?

323
00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:02,880
Thanks. Wow. Yeah, extremely interesting. A couple of things. First of all, in this system,

324
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,200
which we consistently with our multi-scale competency architectures, the individual subunits

325
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,560
that are acting on the price, buying and selling, they're rational agents. So they have a little

326
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:20,720
bit of intelligence themselves that allows them to execute these policies based on the price.

327
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,840
Can we talk a little bit about, or say what you think about, what's the minimal set of

328
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,480
things that they need to know and be able to do for this all to work? How smart do they actually

329
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:40,400
need to be? I believe it's extremely minimal. So the basic concept of rationality is a preference

330
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:47,200
order. Let me see if I can draw something for you. Maybe this is unnecessary, but let me

331
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,200
pull up, and I don't need to do it on a computer. Let me just show you. So the basic concept of

332
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,400
rationality is you have preferences as set, and then rationality is a complete and transitive

333
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,640
order. So I'm just drawing something here. If this is, I don't know if this is visible,

334
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,960
but if you can just see these three dots connected by these lines, this is a rational preference

335
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,240
order. This is an extremely simple structure that exists literally everywhere. If you have this,

336
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,520
you have rationality. This is the minimal competence necessary.

337
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:29,360
So yeah, part of why, this is something that I noticed very early in undergrad,

338
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,560
and part of why I'm attracted to your work. It's like, rationality should be everywhere.

339
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,880
It's in no way restricted to humans at its core. It's a very simple, very basic thing.

340
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,200
So yeah, so I can see, can you just connect the dots a little bit more? Definitely a

341
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,440
preference order is something that is common in biology. Why do you get from preference order to

342
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,840
draw the loop for me? So the price, you have a sensor that can sense the current price,

343
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,640
something like that. You have some kind of an other interstate that says, how much do I need,

344
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,920
whatever this is. Can we just sketch out what's the minimal agent here that you need to participate

345
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:12,240
in the system? Yes. So you would have preferences over, well, in principle, potentially every

346
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,400
possible state of the world, but at least when we're considering a standard shopping example,

347
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,560
preferences over different bundles of goods. You've got the amount of money you have,

348
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,480
and then let's say you've got $10 and like apples are $1 and oranges are $2. You could buy like 10

349
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,280
apples and zero oranges or like, you know, four apples and three oranges, et cetera. And so

350
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:37,440
the basics of economics is you arrange all of those possible bundles into an order based on

351
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,240
preference where you're most preferred at the top all the way down, then you just buy your most

352
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,960
preferred options. That's the basic competence. Can you take your options such as your shopping

353
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,840
bundles and arrange them in a list where you can then select your favorite one on that list?

354
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,840
And if you have any ability to do that in any sense, and actually working on a couple of papers

355
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:02,160
arguing that that power does exist to a much greater degree than people realize. So actually,

356
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,360
this is interesting. I'm working on some stuff about how human beings are diverse cognition

357
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,200
in human beings themselves. Cognition does not work the way people think it does.

358
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,600
And economics exists in human beings in places where people don't realize. So

359
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,800
you don't necessarily need to see people making like shopping lists, as long as there's some

360
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,760
ability to create an ordering over things that in some way map to options, you're good to go.

361
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,080
But presumably there's some, if you were trying to implement this,

362
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,760
somebody makes an offer, I want to sell you this for this price, and you can compare that with

363
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,640
what's the, what's the calculus that you then do to decide what are you actually willing to pay?

364
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,040
So there's two things there. So the basic calculus is you're really comparing it

365
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:54,080
to your opportunity cost. You're comparing it to your other best option and saying,

366
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,440
is this worth doing? If I do this, I don't do something else. Is that worth doing? So that's

367
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,480
what you're comparing is your two different plans, your two different predictions. The price itself

368
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,880
is all relative. So this is actually a key point. I'm glad you brought it up.

369
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,520
Prices just track relative scarcities. So the only thing that matters is the relative prices.

370
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,600
So if apples are $2 and oranges cost $1, or if apples are $4 and oranges cost $2,

371
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,160
it's the same situation. So the price is almost secondary in a way. The only thing that matters

372
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:30,000
is that it should be in some way a mirror of the relative scarcities as an ordering.

373
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,840
But in order to, that's very interesting, but in order to do what you just said to say this

374
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,400
over that, you have to have what? Counterfactuals. You have to have the ability to consider

375
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:49,440
counterfactuals or store memories of other options or like. Yes. So what I'm basically

376
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,360
working on in these papers, do you know, Paul, I think it's pronounced cheesek, Paul cheesek's

377
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,280
work at all? Sure. Yeah. So he's got this action selection hypothesis, I think is really congruent

378
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,920
with some, some recent findings in neuroscience. And basically what's happening in the human brain,

379
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,080
and I suspect similarly in other organisms, though I don't know, is you are, when you're

380
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,240
considering an option, you're actually constructing several options simultaneously. So like a motor

381
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,120
behavior, I'm constructing a bunch of different possible motor behaviors all at once in my brain

382
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:23,520
and anticipating how they're going to plan out. And basically very, very quickly, the brain compares

383
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,680
all of these different options by just, they, they, they compete with each other like literally

384
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,000
in your head and like kind of fight almost for dominance over the brain, whichever one wins

385
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,640
that competition is probably your best option. And then that gets implemented as a result of

386
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,680
winning that competition. So you do literally construct alternatives and have them compete.

387
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,000
And this is actually interesting because economists for a long time, you don't feel

388
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,600
yourself doing that. So economists thought, well, this is just like an as if you're not

389
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,080
really doing this, but it's just useful for modeling you. I think actually neuroscience

390
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,400
shows that this is literally happening. And so I'm actually, I have a paper title,

391
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,680
beyond as if kind of describing some of this stuff. So I do think this literally happens.

392
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,000
You do construct alternatives in your head. I suspect cells do the same thing, although I,

393
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,280
I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, it may, it may well be, I'm thinking now we should take a look at how to

394
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,680
cash out that kind of model in terms of, for example, transcriptional decisions, physiological

395
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,080
decisions. What does it look like to be teeing up a bunch of different transcripts like gene

396
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,680
expression, change responses in, in, in a following some sort of stimulus or a stressor

397
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,040
or something, and then having to choose one in this, in the idea that they can compete with

398
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,160
each other. It's, it's, it's interesting. Well, we'll have to, we'll have to see what that would

399
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:41,520
look like for, for cells. Okay, let's see what else. It's really interesting to me that

400
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,080
that the pricier plays a number of different roles, which is much like what we've been

401
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,800
thinking about for some of the things in, in, in the biology, the kind of morphogenesis field,

402
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,520
which is, so in a certain sense, it's this, it's, it's the middle node of some kind of bowtie,

403
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,840
right? Because it encompasses in a, in a very compressed representation, a huge amount of

404
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,880
other information, but also from that, it has all these fan out consequences that it sort of

405
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,560
encodes, encodes that. To what extent, so, okay, so, so, so there's that, then, then there's a

406
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,800
thing you pointed out about the shared model, right, that it, that it's also encode some kind of

407
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,760
shared, shared view of, of the world and it's binding, binding everybody together into the

408
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:28,000
same, same picture of the world. At the same time, it's a control knob, because by impacting,

409
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,160
I probably should get to have all sorts of interesting consequences more widely. And as

410
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,840
you point out at the end, it's, it also has a perspective and a degree of agency because the

411
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,560
price itself has, has certain interests in this, which I think is one of the most interesting

412
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:49,120
things that, that aspect, like watching how things can run that spectrum and can be simultaneously

413
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,080
though, all of the play, you know, play all of those roles, I think is, is, is very interesting.

414
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:02,080
And I wonder, you know, I wonder if we can say more, could we, could we say I'm in the system

415
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,280
you've described, there are a number of layers that you can try to imagine taking the perspective

416
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,280
of, right? So obviously, the easiest for us is the individual humans that are the individual pieces

417
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,640
that react to the, to the price. But could we say, for example, what does the world look like

418
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:19,920
from the perspective of the price itself? Right? What is its world? And I'm, I'm talking about

419
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:26,000
the kind of thing that, you know, when, when, when Randy Beier does this cognitive domain

420
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,920
of a glider, that kind of thing, when you, when you're looking at, at really unconventional

421
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,360
agents and minimal patterns and things like that and asking what does the world look like from

422
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:40,080
their perspective? Yeah. What, why don't we just start there? What do you think the world looks

423
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,960
like if you, if you're the price? Yes, I have given that some thought. I don't think I've come up

424
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,800
with anything terribly useful. But what does occur to me is that, you know, what the price

425
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,120
seems to naturally want to do is to preserve itself. It wants to preserve its relationship

426
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:01,120
with other prices. It doesn't want to change in any kind of predictable way, just like an organism.

427
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,400
And it naturally achieves that just by the equilibrium price just incentivizes people

428
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,960
not to mess with it, except as new information comes in, which then should update the equilibrium

429
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:21,920
price. So it does seem to me there is at least some kind of minimal model which you can think of

430
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:37,440
about prices, something like an organism that's trying to maintain allostasis and buyer. I have

431
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:45,120
no idea with that. Did I cut out? Yeah, there's something I can, but there's something going on

432
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:54,080
with your Wi-Fi, I think. Yeah, it might be a little unstable. It seems better now. I mean,

433
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,360
did I cut off there? Did you get all that? I think, I think I got it. Yeah.

434
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,120
Is there, is there any notion of, you know, like right now the price is a single scalar

435
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,960
and that's great for many things because it's an enormous compression into a simple thing.

436
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,920
Is there any idea about what would happen if it were richer, some kind of a higher dimensional

437
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,880
concept? Yeah, people have talked about that. I'm not too familiar with any specific models.

438
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,520
Right now, just getting everything incorporated into the scalars is hard enough. I do think that's

439
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:42,240
a rich area for potential exploration, but I don't have any specific ideas about it.

440
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,760
Okay. And similar to the question about the perspective of the price itself, what do you

441
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,640
think, you know, usually in biology what we have is we have the organism and then we sort of start

442
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,400
asking questions about the cognitive blue and how the pieces actually add up. So in this case,

443
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,040
we're kind of going backwards because everybody believes that the individuals are our agents,

444
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,680
but then, you know, there's this cognitive glue that you've identified that binds them together.

445
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,880
What do you think the collective is doing? In other words, again, looking at it from the

446
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,720
perspective of the collective, having been bound together by this, by this economic model,

447
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,560
what are the goals, the preferences, the competencies, what does it, you know, the economy,

448
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,480
I guess is what we're talking about. What do you think, what does the world look like from its

449
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:35,840
perspective? I think the answer to that is analogous to the answer for an individual,

450
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,800
which is less semantically clear than people believe. Like as an individual, when we talk

451
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,200
about our goals, it's easy to say, oh, my goal is to like do some economics thing.

452
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,560
But in reality, that's not really what's going on. My goal is to achieve allostasis by managing my

453
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,200
metabolism and like energy regulating the ins and outs of what's going on with my body. I think

454
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,880
that's also true of the price system. You could say, oh, like it's trying to make pencils or

455
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,840
trying to do this or that. Really, it's trying to achieve allostasis, which it does by coordinating

456
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,960
all of the subunits, getting everything to work together. That is in principle, its only goal,

457
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,720
I believe. Do you think that there's the active inference perspective, like something like

458
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:21,360
surprise minimization would be applicable to that agent? Absolutely. And I borrowed a lot from that

459
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,760
perspective. And it was moving away from economics to some neuroscience, like I keep bringing up

460
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,120
Lisa Feldman Barrett. I have a quote I have to mention my name once every time we talk.

461
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,760
Her work helped me make a lot of progress and then prepared me to understand your work as well.

462
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,480
So I think that's big and I wish more economists were aware of that.

463
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:46,800
Do you think that the system as a whole is trainable? In other words, is there a notion

464
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,480
of memory here that you could, you know, future behavior, some kind of hysteresis,

465
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,880
historicity, like future behavior would be different based on the history of prior stimuli?

466
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,920
Yes, it's a bit tricky to give a clear answer to this because I think it gets so mixed up with

467
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,440
the trainability of humans and firms. Like the economy is trainable, but that's not surprising

468
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,080
to economists because people are trainable. So there is a great deal of research about how firms

469
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,760
learn and like based on previous instances, they'll then change how they're going to behave

470
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:25,360
in the future. The trainability of just the price system itself, I suppose it's conceivable that

471
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:32,480
maybe certain, I don't know, like elasticities might be influenced by past behavior, but I don't

472
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,880
have any specific ideas. So right now I'd say it's a little tricky to disambiguate that

473
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,880
from just the trainability of people and people made organizations such as businesses.

474
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,400
I think we actually, so this might be an interesting thing for us to do some research on

475
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,040
because I think actually you can disambiguate it by analogy to what we did in gene regulatory

476
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,280
networks. So if you have a model of gene regulatory networks, which is just a set of

477
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,360
coupled differential equations that say how each gene turns the other genes on and off,

478
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,880
we showed six different kinds of learning, including pavlovian conditioning in that model,

479
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:13,520
but specifically the pieces A were completely dumb, so they did not learn. So unlike in what

480
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,880
you're talking about now, the nodes themselves have zero learning capacity, all they have is state,

481
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,440
so they just have whatever their current, they don't have any memory, they don't have any of that,

482
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:29,760
they just have whatever my current state is, that's all I know. So zero memory. And that's A

483
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,640
and B, what you're also not allowed to do in these models is change the topology of the network. In

484
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,200
other words, how strong are the connections? So the typical things you would do to train a network

485
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,920
like that, which is to adjust the synaptic weight, right? And the connections between the nodes,

486
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,400
you're not allowed to change that, the network is completely fixed. So no intelligence in the

487
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:56,640
nodes, no changes of the topology. And yet, just from the dynamical systems behavior of that,

488
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,800
of certain not all, it's not a universal thing, the way that you know, some of like, for example,

489
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,640
Stu Kaufman's origins of order in that network stuff is which is just like widely applicable

490
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,880
to random networks. This isn't like that random networks don't do this as well as biological

491
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,160
networks. So I think evolution actually has probably selected for ones that are good at this,

492
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,040
but nevertheless, there are plenty of networks that can learn without with the pieces being

493
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,480
being completely done. So, so I wonder, I wonder if we had an economic model where you clamp so

494
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,560
an in silico computational economic model, you clamp the behavior of the individual so they

495
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:39,520
cannot learn. Probably we can even we can even clamp the relationships between them. But we

496
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,280
examine the behavior of the system after stimuli that are patterned in the way that behavioral

497
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,040
scientists do it for, you know, for testing habituation sensitization, pathology and conditioning,

498
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,280
whatever. I wonder if we would if we would see learning there my conjecture is that that we would

499
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,480
I think this this my guess is that this is a very widespread capacity. And I think we could

500
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,720
potentially show that if you if you if you clamp, you know, if you clamp the behavior of the individuals.

501
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,000
I'd be inclined to agree because I do just think these systems should be analogous.

502
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,440
I'm wondering now so there's a Nobel Prize winner Vernon Smith who became sort of known for doing

503
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,880
economic experiments which we usually can't do very well. I wonder if there are some analogies

504
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,160
in his work. So maybe I'll try to read up a little bit on the gene regulatory stuff

505
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,920
and see if I can find any connections to anything Vernon Smith has done.

506
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,920
Maybe not, but it's exploring. Yeah, yeah, that's cool. You know, and I wonder as you look at the

507
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,200
GRN stuff, I wonder if we can define, for example, in these networks, what would be the equivalent

508
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:50,080
of the price? Right? Could we say that by watching their behavior? Actually, how about this? Do you

509
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:58,480
think that watching it's like a it's like a weird touring test. If if if I showed a bunch of economists

510
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:05,520
the behavior of some system, some distributed system, could they say that hey, this absolutely

511
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,640
looks like any like an economy or no, it does not. Is that something that or or can you make

512
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,400
anything look like an economy in which case we could actually do the mapping and figure out,

513
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,480
you know, what what does the price? What is the price in this in this GRN?

514
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,560
That's an interesting question. I never thought about that. I suspect that most economists would

515
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,640
just because you know, their academics just be cautious about drawing any conclusions that

516
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,640
haven't been like hard verified. But that's an interesting question. I'd be very interested

517
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,320
in seeing the results. Yeah, I don't know. That's very interesting. It's that's worth exploring for

518
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:45,280
sure. Yeah, I mean, one one one way to get started with that is if you identify for me,

519
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,560
what does it what does an economic data set look like? That is, what does an economist

520
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:57,120
fix? So if you were going to say to a colleague, okay, I'm going to show you the the parameters

521
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,200
of this economic system, what do they expect to see? You know, what what does the what does the

522
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,160
data look like? What what what are they looking for? Is it, you know, prices over time or distributed

523
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,880
buys and sells or what are they looking for? I bet if we understood the format of that,

524
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,320
I could give you a data set. I would, you know, we could do a blind thing where I wouldn't tell

525
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,560
you what it really was. You can show it to people and they say, oh, a classic case of,

526
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,240
you know, an economy of this type. And then we could find out that actually this is this is,

527
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,160
you know, a bunch of cells communicating during, I don't know, axial determination or something.

528
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,800
I think I think it would be interesting to to to to use that as a as a way of finding these

529
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,080
kinds of mappings, you know. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. I will look into that. That's a really

530
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:48,320
good idea. I think that'd be fun. All right. And I guess, okay, the last question that came to my

531
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:55,600
mind is this, does all of this does everything we've you've said today, assume a perfect efficiency,

532
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:00,080
like, like, like immediate, you know, instantaneous transfer of information, all that kind of stuff.

533
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:10,960
No, but of course, you won't, you won't achieve like perfect outcomes without it. But no, you

534
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,080
don't need that to have something that the perfection within a body, but I still feel like

535
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,200
myself. And I believe the same is true of the economy. And then as technology improves, we will,

536
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,840
of course, improve the efficiency of it. Right now, a tremendous amount of people are not terribly

537
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:28,720
bound into the economy. I mean, billions people are in poverty and so on. And so over time, that

538
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,520
will increase greatly. But yeah, in the first world, like, certainly the stock market or something

539
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,680
like that is bound together tightly enough. I think it's reasonable to think of it this way.

540
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,840
And I'll tell you why I asked, but I'm also thinking about, you know, kind of information

541
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,240
efficiencies, like, you're when you buy and again, I'm I know nothing about economics. So this

542
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,640
could be nonsense. But to me, it seems like when you're when you're when you're when you're

543
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,040
selling something, you want to get rid of it. And you think it's a good idea to get rid of it.

544
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,560
For that to work, somebody else needs to disagree with you and think that it's a good idea to buy

545
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:05,600
it. And so right, so there are going to be differences in how informed people are. And

546
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:10,000
somebody's going to make money because they're more informed than somebody else. And, and of course,

547
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
then people can make bets on what's going to happen with the economy and things like that.

548
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,720
Right. So, so the reason I bring this up is because if you think about, so let's think about

549
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,360
the biological case, you got a, you got a set of cells, and the cells are now coupled by gap

550
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:29,200
gap junctions, right? Now, so, so that's a kind of cognitive blue, because the biotech signals

551
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,640
are now spreading through the through the continued through the through the tissue. And

552
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,600
it's now harder for any one cell to be an ally or in terms of its memories, and it's a model of

553
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:45,200
the world because it's sharing physiological parameters exactly directly with its neighbors.

554
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:50,000
But in the real world, it takes time for information to propagate through that tissue.

555
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,480
And so much like, you know, the speed of light is a kind of like this limit in the in the in

556
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,120
physics that binds the ties together space and time, there's going to be a constant like that

557
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:04,480
in any tissue that basically tells you how fast can information propagate, right? And how fast it

558
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,760
can, it can can can can signals and information get across the thing. So you're going to have

559
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,680
scenarios where for some amount of time, there are going to be regions. So let's say so, so, so,

560
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,720
so here's your cellular network, your tissue, something happens over here to trigger it,

561
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,320
there's going to be some time where the ones over here know about it and the ones back here don't

562
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:32,720
yet. So I wonder to what extent, and you can also think about that delta, having something to do

563
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,200
with the thickness of the cognitive now moment, right, that that you're not instantaneous, there's

564
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,040
about a couple of hundred milliseconds in neuroscience, they tell you that that is when when

565
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,280
the things are propagated. And below that, you can't really answer questions. Did I see it? You

566
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,240
know, am I was I aware of it? You only you can only answer those questions from the definitively

567
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,600
from the perspective of the larger, larger cognitive agent from a certain, you know,

568
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,040
after the information has had a chance to propagate and all the subsystems have had their say,

569
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,360
and eventually you can say yes, you did, or you didn't. So there's a temporal resolution,

570
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,840
right, below which you can't really slice yourself that temporal thickness. So I wonder if

571
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:15,680
something like this is going on here, and I wonder if it's also helpful, if there's any kind of a

572
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,600
helpful mapping, if the things that economists, I assume economists know a lot about what happens

573
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:26,240
when there are discrepancies in information in the in the economy and ability to act and so on.

574
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,480
I wonder if some of those things could help us understand development or morphogenesis more

575
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,400
roughly. I suspect so. I mean, information asymmetry is a huge field of research where

576
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,600
like you're trading with someone who knows more than you about the good. So you have to ask like,

577
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,280
why are they selling this to me? And that can make it very challenging to create markets.

578
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,440
You also have things like no trade theorems, where like if we're all, you know, trading the

579
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,120
stock market, potentially the only reason you're selling to me is because you think it's going

580
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:58,400
down. It's like, why would I buy it? So there are instances where differences in information can

581
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,640
really make it very difficult to trade, even though at the same time, the whole point of

582
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,120
trading is to ultimately bring everyone's information into sync with each other. So yes,

583
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:12,240
there is a tremendous amount of research about that in both finance and information asymmetry,

584
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:30,480
economics. That's absolutely something that could be incorporated in some way.

585
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,120
Okay, yeah, the Wi-Fi is really good. Maybe I cut out again. Yeah, yeah, it's really

586
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:43,440
accurate. I guess the last thing I'll just suggest, and this is something we can do in later work,

587
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,760
is like I think you've painted an amazing picture of the parallels between the two systems.

588
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:53,360
And I think the other complementary thing we can do is look at the parallels of the disorders.

589
00:49:53,360 --> 00:50:04,800
Yeah, so the various ways that economics goes bad and has various breakdowns of optimal functioning.

590
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:11,440
I wonder if we can map that onto specific disorders in other spaces in living systems.

591
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,680
I wonder if there's a version of, I don't know, developmental defects, cancer,

592
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:22,480
failure to repair, all those kinds of things. Yeah, I think cancer is an externality,

593
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,520
and externality is sort of the generalization of all of those issues. Currently, economists

594
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,560
have a very hard time talking about externality. It's actually hard to make it consistent with

595
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,960
economics. So I have a paper on my website talking about that issue, actually citing some of your

596
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,200
work as to how we could try to make progress on that. So I believe those parallels are definitely

597
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,920
there, and I have been thinking about it. And what we might actually need is biologists to

598
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,400
figure out cancer and then use that so we can solve externality. So the direction might flow that way.

599
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:56,320
Yeah, I think that's very interesting to think about which direction, probably both, but the

600
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:01,920
insights could flow. I mean, we've had some luck normalizing cancer, at least in the amphibian

601
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,400
models, we're moving on to mammals now, and to human cells now, but we've had some really good

602
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,920
luck in frog models. So we could think about what that might be. But I think in general, some

603
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,480
research that we could do together would be to get hold of a computational model. I assume

604
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:26,480
there are computer models of simple or maybe not simple economic systems that people can play with.

605
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,080
So actually, computational models have not been huge in economics because they haven't been able

606
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:36,400
to tell us anything that's surprising. And so actually, what I've been thinking about, because

607
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,040
you mentioned this before, is maybe they could make like a comeback, because it would be surprising

608
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:47,200
just to see economics in biology. And so I'm not familiar at all with computational economics,

609
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,960
but I do believe that is a very useful path. And relatedly, one thing I've been thinking about is

610
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,680
there's a field called economic geography, which explains like why does finance end up in New

611
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,000
York and like tech end up in San Francisco. I think that could be useful for explaining like

612
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,080
why does your heart end up here and like your kidney end up where it is. So I think computational

613
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:10,400
models could be interesting in that context, but I currently don't know anything about them. So I

614
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,000
definitely have to do some studying. Yeah, let me know what you what you turn up. I think it would

615
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,240
be cool. I mean, I remember, you know, from 100 years ago, like lemonade stand, right? Like you

616
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:23,440
could easily something as simple as that. And probably that one, I'm guessing is too simple,

617
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,400
but there must be things for students to play with. And that where if we, if we, you know, rip

618
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,680
the graphic interface off of it and use the underlying computations, we could test things like

619
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:39,760
can we can we induce and repair various disorders in the biology focus way? Can we try the learning

620
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:45,200
and the training? Can we use it to generate data sets to compare to other things and see if

621
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,320
economists can actually pick out which one's the economy and which one's the

622
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,320
morphogenetic signaling, all those things. I think we should we should look into it.

623
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,200
Absolutely. I think so too. Yeah, that'd be super cool.
