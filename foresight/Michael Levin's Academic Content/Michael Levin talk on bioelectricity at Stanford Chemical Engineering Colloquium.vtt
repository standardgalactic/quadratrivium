WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
Thank you for the opportunity to speak to all of you

00:04.320 --> 00:07.440
and to share some work and get your feedback.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.840
So if anyone would like more details

00:10.840 --> 00:13.280
or to get in touch with me, all the papers,

00:13.280 --> 00:16.520
everything else is at these websites here.

00:16.520 --> 00:19.460
And so there are four basic points

00:19.460 --> 00:21.700
that I would like to get across today.

00:21.700 --> 00:23.440
The first is that there are really

00:23.440 --> 00:25.200
some very significant knowledge gaps

00:25.200 --> 00:28.880
about the control of large scale anatomical homeostasis.

00:28.880 --> 00:33.880
And this is roughly, it encompasses our understanding

00:34.040 --> 00:36.600
of the relationship between the genome and the anatomy.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.640
And I'll show you why things are quite puzzling there.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.800
And I will claim that fundamental advances

00:43.800 --> 00:46.120
and new biomedicine are going to require

00:46.120 --> 00:48.840
not only understanding the molecular mechanisms

00:48.840 --> 00:51.600
that are required for this process to happen,

00:51.600 --> 00:54.000
but actually also the decision making

00:54.000 --> 00:57.600
by cellular collectives that is sufficient for it to happen.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.000
And that a key medium for computation and living tissue

01:01.000 --> 01:04.640
is something that is called non-neural bioelectricity.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.280
Now we've developed some techniques

01:06.280 --> 01:10.000
to manipulate this layer of basically physiological software

01:10.000 --> 01:11.800
and I'll show you why I say that.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.040
And fundamentally looking towards the future,

01:14.040 --> 01:17.240
I will argue that cracking this bioelectric code

01:17.240 --> 01:21.120
that will enable a kind of novel approach

01:21.120 --> 01:24.920
using electroseuticals for applications in birth defects,

01:24.920 --> 01:28.640
regenerative medicine, cancer and synthetic bioengineering.

01:28.640 --> 01:32.320
And boiling down the whole talk into basically two sentences,

01:32.320 --> 01:34.800
what I'm going to tell you is that like the brain,

01:34.800 --> 01:37.040
your body tissues form electrical networks

01:37.040 --> 01:38.320
that make decisions.

01:38.320 --> 01:41.000
These are decisions about dynamic anatomy

01:41.000 --> 01:43.800
and that we now have the ability to target the system

01:43.800 --> 01:45.680
to control large scale editing

01:45.680 --> 01:49.480
that can even override all kinds of genomic default states

01:49.480 --> 01:51.920
with lots of advantages and opportunities

01:51.920 --> 01:54.680
for regenerative medicine and synthetic bioengineering.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.200
And I show you one of our five-legged frogs

01:57.200 --> 01:59.320
to just point out that you're going to see

01:59.320 --> 02:01.000
all kinds of weird creatures today.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.080
None of this is Photoshop.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.000
These are all actual living things

02:04.000 --> 02:07.920
that represent our attempt to test some of the models

02:07.920 --> 02:09.600
that we have.

02:09.600 --> 02:13.200
So let's look at these knowledge gaps.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.640
If we think about what is the end game of our field?

02:16.640 --> 02:17.760
Where are we going?

02:17.760 --> 02:19.760
At what point can we all go home?

02:19.760 --> 02:23.440
What we would like to have is something

02:23.440 --> 02:25.920
that we call the anatomical compiler.

02:25.920 --> 02:29.600
The deal is that you ought to be able to sit down

02:29.600 --> 02:33.200
and draw the animal or plant that you would like to have

02:33.200 --> 02:34.760
at the level of the anatomy.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.120
So not at the level of pathways,

02:36.120 --> 02:37.600
but at the level of final anatomy,

02:37.600 --> 02:40.960
the way that we do with machine parts and things like this,

02:40.960 --> 02:43.880
then you would be able to draw this three-headed worm.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.120
And if we knew what we were doing,

02:46.120 --> 02:49.760
we would have the capability of having the software

02:49.760 --> 02:53.760
which would then compile this anatomical description down

02:53.760 --> 02:56.680
into a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells

02:56.680 --> 02:58.800
that would cause them to produce whatever it was

02:58.800 --> 02:59.640
that you just drew.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.920
So here's this three-headed flat worm.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.640
Now, the reason that this is fundamentally important

03:05.640 --> 03:09.800
is that almost all of the problems of biomedicine,

03:09.800 --> 03:12.080
so except for infectious disease,

03:12.080 --> 03:14.320
pretty much everything else, birth defects,

03:14.320 --> 03:16.840
traumatic injury, cancer, aging,

03:16.840 --> 03:19.600
all of these things would be solved

03:19.640 --> 03:22.760
if we had the ability to tell cells what to build.

03:22.760 --> 03:27.240
If we had the knowledge to control what it is

03:27.240 --> 03:30.360
that cellular collectives cooperate towards building.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.560
So all of these things are in some important sense,

03:32.560 --> 03:34.760
problems of information processing.

03:34.760 --> 03:38.200
How is it that cells work together to build these things?

03:38.200 --> 03:40.320
And so, of course, we are very far

03:40.320 --> 03:42.680
from having anything like this.

03:42.680 --> 03:46.640
And only in a few very special cases do we know anything

03:46.640 --> 03:50.720
about how to make specific shapes come up.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.160
So let's think about why that is.

03:52.160 --> 03:55.160
So where is anatomy specified?

03:55.160 --> 03:58.040
I mean, we all start life roughly like this.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.960
So this is a collection of embryonic blastomeres.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.320
And then shortly thereafter,

04:02.320 --> 04:03.760
you get something like this.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.240
This is a cross-section through a human torso.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.480
So look at this incredible invariant order.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.640
All of these organs are the correct shape, size,

04:13.080 --> 04:18.080
position, orientation, everything is next to the right stuff.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.320
It's absolutely staggering amount of order.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.280
And so we would like to know, first of all,

04:24.280 --> 04:26.760
where is this information coming from?

04:26.760 --> 04:28.480
We're tempted to say DNA,

04:28.480 --> 04:30.720
but of course we know what genomes specify.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.200
The DNA specifies proteins.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.480
There's nothing directly in there

04:33.480 --> 04:35.320
that specifies any of this.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.080
So we would like to know how is it

04:37.080 --> 04:40.240
that cells use the genomically specified hardware

04:40.240 --> 04:42.400
that they have to know what to make.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.680
And when to stop.

04:43.680 --> 04:44.960
In regenerative medicine,

04:44.960 --> 04:46.960
we would like to know if a piece of this is missing,

04:46.960 --> 04:48.920
how do we get the cells to rebuild it?

04:48.920 --> 04:49.840
And as engineers,

04:49.840 --> 04:52.920
we ask what's actually possible to build

04:52.920 --> 04:55.800
given any particular default genome.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.800
And so the reason that in my group,

04:57.800 --> 05:00.000
we frame this thing as a basically

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
a collective intelligence problem

05:02.000 --> 05:05.480
is that individual cells are extremely competent.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.080
So here you see one cell.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.560
This is a single cell organism.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.440
This is called the lacrimaria.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.440
And there is no brain.

05:12.440 --> 05:13.520
There's no nervous system.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.520
There are no stem cells.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.360
There's no cell-to-cell communication.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.480
Just one cell handling all of its local goals.

05:19.480 --> 05:24.560
So it's handling its physiological goals, anatomical,

05:24.560 --> 05:27.720
control, metabolic, behavioral.

05:27.720 --> 05:31.120
Everything is handled by this one cell in real time, okay?

05:31.120 --> 05:34.200
And so the amazing thing is that these cells,

05:34.200 --> 05:36.480
which are extremely competent in their local,

05:36.480 --> 05:38.640
very small sort of environment,

05:38.640 --> 05:41.160
when they work together to make a metazoin body,

05:41.160 --> 05:43.320
they can work on much bigger goals.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.160
So what you see is an inflation, not only of body size,

05:46.160 --> 05:49.160
but actually of their ability to pursue states

05:49.160 --> 05:51.680
in various kinds of problem spaces,

05:51.680 --> 05:53.880
including anatomical morpho space,

05:53.880 --> 05:55.600
physiological space and so on.

05:55.600 --> 06:00.360
So a single cell can give rise to a collection of cells

06:00.360 --> 06:04.680
that self-assembles into some incredibly complex morphology.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.720
And we know that simply understanding

06:07.720 --> 06:10.040
stem cell biology is not going to be enough

06:10.040 --> 06:11.720
because here we have a teratoma

06:11.720 --> 06:14.320
and this thing might have hair and teeth and bone

06:14.320 --> 06:15.960
and muscle and skin.

06:15.960 --> 06:20.960
And so the work of the stem cells has proceeded fine.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.400
You have all your derivatives.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.440
You have your various tissues.

06:24.440 --> 06:27.280
What you don't have is this three-dimensional structures.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.440
We need to understand how this works.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.960
And in a standard developmental biology,

06:31.960 --> 06:33.360
the story that we're told

06:33.360 --> 06:37.040
is a kind of a feed-forward open-loop system

06:37.040 --> 06:40.600
which is very much based around emergence.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.640
So the idea is that there are gene regulatory networks,

06:43.640 --> 06:45.400
so genes turn each other on and off.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.280
Some of these genes are effector code for effector proteins.

06:49.280 --> 06:50.880
So they are sticky or they diffuse

06:50.880 --> 06:52.960
or they exert force or something like this.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.240
And then there's this physical process

06:55.240 --> 06:57.560
where all of these things interact with each other

06:57.560 --> 07:00.360
and then through the things that are studied

07:00.360 --> 07:02.960
by the science of complexity and so on,

07:02.960 --> 07:06.840
outcome these amazingly complex results.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.800
So like the salamander here.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.000
So this now, the story is certainly true

07:12.000 --> 07:14.520
in the sense that these things all happen,

07:14.520 --> 07:16.560
but it's incomplete, I think,

07:16.560 --> 07:18.640
and it has a fundamental difficulty

07:18.640 --> 07:20.400
which is this inverse problem.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.240
The idea is that if we're committed

07:22.240 --> 07:24.560
to this feed-forward emergent story,

07:24.560 --> 07:27.440
then making changes here require us

07:27.440 --> 07:31.240
to exert our interventions down here

07:31.240 --> 07:33.960
at the, for example, at the genetic level.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.000
And that means that we have to try to invert

07:36.000 --> 07:37.200
this process of emergence

07:37.200 --> 07:40.080
which is fundamentally insolvable.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.480
So most of these inverse problems

07:41.480 --> 07:43.600
are just too difficult to solve.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.720
How do you know what genes to tweak

07:45.720 --> 07:47.200
to make desire changes

07:47.200 --> 07:50.000
at the three-dimensional anatomy level?

07:50.000 --> 07:53.080
So the current state of affairs is basically this.

07:53.080 --> 07:54.600
We're very good at things like this,

07:54.600 --> 07:57.160
at figuring out the lowest hardware level

07:57.160 --> 07:59.440
of which genes and proteins interact

07:59.440 --> 08:01.040
with which other genes and proteins.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.600
But what we'd really like to understand

08:02.600 --> 08:03.440
are things like this,

08:03.440 --> 08:06.600
the ability of planaria to regenerate from pieces,

08:06.600 --> 08:09.680
the shape of the hand and the shape of the foot

08:09.680 --> 08:10.840
and why they're different

08:10.840 --> 08:12.520
and what you would have to do

08:12.520 --> 08:14.960
to get these specific shapes back.

08:14.960 --> 08:18.120
It's very not obvious what you would do at this level.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.240
So the amazing thing is that

08:20.240 --> 08:22.640
some animals are very good at this

08:22.640 --> 08:25.960
and their bodies show remarkable plasticity

08:25.960 --> 08:28.720
in this kind of collective activity of the cell.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.560
So for example here, this animal is a salamander.

08:31.560 --> 08:35.040
It regenerates its limbs, its eyes, its jaws,

08:35.040 --> 08:37.720
its portions of the brain and the heart.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.080
So if they're amputated, they will grow back.

08:40.080 --> 08:43.560
And what's cool is that not only

08:43.560 --> 08:45.480
is this process incredibly flexible,

08:45.480 --> 08:47.280
meaning if you amputate at the shoulder,

08:47.280 --> 08:48.520
you grow the whole thing.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.000
If you amputate at the wrist,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.920
you start here and you just grow the parts you need.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.440
But then it stops.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.640
And that's the most remarkable part of all of this.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.080
And so lots of people work on trying

08:58.080 --> 08:59.480
to kickstart regeneration,

08:59.480 --> 09:01.520
but actually how does it know when to stop?

09:01.520 --> 09:03.200
Because when it stops is when it has built

09:03.200 --> 09:05.560
a correct salamander arm, that's when it stops.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.920
How does the system know

09:06.920 --> 09:09.240
when it's built a correct salamander arm?

09:09.240 --> 09:10.880
Now, it's important to note

09:10.880 --> 09:14.280
that this is not just some weird quirk of salamanders.

09:14.280 --> 09:17.600
So the human mammals can do some of this.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.240
The human liver is highly regenerative.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.280
That's been known for a long time, unclear to me

09:21.280 --> 09:23.840
how the ancient Greeks knew that, but they clearly did.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.520
The human liver is regenerative.

09:26.440 --> 09:30.360
Deer regenerate huge amounts of bone

09:30.360 --> 09:33.520
up to a centimeter and a half of new bone per day, okay?

09:33.520 --> 09:36.000
Every day over a centimeter of bone growth.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.280
So bone, vasculature, innervation, skin,

09:40.280 --> 09:43.080
and even human children can regrow fingertips.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.480
Usually it stops at a particular age,

09:45.480 --> 09:46.480
but if you just keep it clean,

09:46.480 --> 09:47.600
the amputation will give rise

09:47.600 --> 09:49.880
to a cosmetically perfect finger.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.320
So the champions of this process

09:53.640 --> 09:56.080
are these guys, these are planaria, these are flatworms.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.480
They have a true brain, central nervous system,

09:58.480 --> 10:01.520
the same neurotransmitters that you and I have.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.480
And the amazing thing about them

10:03.480 --> 10:05.680
is that you can cut them into lots of pieces.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.840
The record is 275.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.520
And every piece will regrow exactly what's missing,

10:11.520 --> 10:12.360
no more, no less,

10:12.360 --> 10:14.360
to give you a perfect tiny little worm.

10:14.360 --> 10:15.840
While the new stuff is growing,

10:15.840 --> 10:18.120
the remaining tissue is actually shrinking

10:18.120 --> 10:21.120
so that they will as quickly as possible

10:21.120 --> 10:23.680
get to correct proportionality.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.040
And the other thing about them is they're immortal.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.880
There's no such thing as an old planarian.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.320
So if you're interested in aging or these ideas

10:30.320 --> 10:33.000
that things inevitably wind down and accumulate errors

10:33.000 --> 10:35.680
and so on, planaria are telling us

10:35.680 --> 10:37.600
that that is not absolutely required.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.600
Here's a life form that's basically immortal.

10:40.600 --> 10:44.080
And the thing to understand about all of this

10:44.080 --> 10:46.880
is that we really are,

10:46.880 --> 10:49.680
not despite all the amazing progress in molecular genetics,

10:49.680 --> 10:51.520
we're really not very far along

10:51.520 --> 10:54.080
in understanding how the cellular collectives

10:54.080 --> 10:55.480
make decisions.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.680
And one of the easiest ways to see that

10:57.680 --> 11:00.800
is to just think about chimeric organisms.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.360
So here's a simple example,

11:02.360 --> 11:04.440
which we're making in my lab right now.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.840
Here's an axolotl larvae, axolotl larvae have legs.

11:07.840 --> 11:11.120
Here's a frog larvae, a tadpole, tadpoles do not have legs.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.800
And one can ask a simple question.

11:12.800 --> 11:17.440
If I combine axolotl tissue with early frog tissue,

11:17.440 --> 11:19.280
so in early embryogenesis,

11:19.280 --> 11:22.360
I make a chimeric embryo, they're perfectly healthy.

11:22.360 --> 11:24.240
These are, we call them frog allotls.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.800
We have the genomes, we have the axolotl gene

11:26.800 --> 11:28.440
and we have the frog genome.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.920
And now we ask a simple question

11:29.920 --> 11:32.440
to frog allotls have legs, right?

11:32.440 --> 11:33.920
And even though we have all this information,

11:33.920 --> 11:36.520
we actually have no idea how to predict in advance

11:36.520 --> 11:38.080
whether frog allotls will have legs.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.960
And if so, will they be made entirely of axolotl cells

11:40.960 --> 11:43.240
or both types of cells or what?

11:43.240 --> 11:44.240
So these are the kinds of things

11:44.240 --> 11:47.280
that we would actually like to understand.

11:47.280 --> 11:49.560
And one thing that's very important

11:49.560 --> 11:52.520
as part of this process is specifically the algorithm

11:52.520 --> 11:56.080
that enables robustness and the handling of novelty.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.240
And I'll show you a simple example of that.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.160
So we discovered this a few years ago.

12:00.160 --> 12:04.280
So here is a tadpole and it has eyes here,

12:04.280 --> 12:06.600
it has nostrils and a mouth down here.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.560
All of these things have to move around

12:08.560 --> 12:10.480
in order to get to a frog face, okay?

12:10.480 --> 12:13.080
So during metamorphosis, the face has to deform.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.440
The jaws have to come out, the eyes have to move forward,

12:15.440 --> 12:16.760
everything has to move.

12:16.760 --> 12:20.040
So it was thought that somehow what the genome did

12:20.040 --> 12:24.080
was to give each piece of the face a particular direction

12:24.080 --> 12:25.360
and amount of movement.

12:25.360 --> 12:28.640
And that way standard tadpoles become standard frogs.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.440
What we did was we created what we call Picasso tadpoles.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.520
So everything's in the wrong position.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.720
The eyes are on top of the head,

12:34.720 --> 12:38.840
the mouth is off to the side, everything is mixed up.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.480
I'll show you in a minute how we do it.

12:40.480 --> 12:43.680
But the amazing thing is that these animals become

12:43.680 --> 12:45.600
pretty much normal frogs

12:45.600 --> 12:48.360
because all of these different organs move around

12:48.360 --> 12:51.440
through unnatural paths and sometimes they go too far

12:51.440 --> 12:52.680
and actually have to back up,

12:52.680 --> 12:54.520
but everything moves around until it gets

12:54.520 --> 12:58.280
to a correct frog face and then the remodeling stops.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.760
So in fact, what the genetics does specify

13:00.760 --> 13:03.640
is not a bunch of hardwired rearrangements,

13:03.640 --> 13:04.960
but a system that executes

13:04.960 --> 13:07.600
a really flexible error minimization scheme.

13:07.600 --> 13:12.120
It's able to start off at incorrect or abnormal positions

13:12.120 --> 13:14.640
and still get to where it needs to be.

13:14.640 --> 13:17.600
This apparently matches William James's definition

13:17.600 --> 13:20.360
of intelligence, which is the ability to reach

13:20.360 --> 13:23.000
the same outcome despite perturbations

13:23.000 --> 13:26.480
and starting from novel, starting configurations.

13:26.480 --> 13:30.240
So how does this system know what a correct face is

13:30.240 --> 13:31.920
and how do we get there?

13:31.920 --> 13:34.720
So we've been thinking about this problem

13:34.720 --> 13:37.480
and we would like to, my background is computer science.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.960
And so to me, all of this looks like a problem

13:39.960 --> 13:42.240
of information processing at different levels.

13:42.280 --> 13:47.200
And what I would love to know is could we go beyond

13:47.200 --> 13:49.640
the hardware and operating at this level

13:49.640 --> 13:50.840
and ask about the algorithms?

13:50.840 --> 13:52.720
How are these decisions being made?

13:52.720 --> 13:55.040
What do the cellular collectives measure?

13:55.040 --> 13:58.520
What are their modules or subroutines?

13:58.520 --> 14:02.440
How are these global patterning goals specified and stored?

14:02.440 --> 14:04.400
And in particular, how reprogrammable

14:04.400 --> 14:06.720
is any piece of biological hardware?

14:06.720 --> 14:09.520
So in computer science, there was this really interesting

14:09.520 --> 14:12.840
journey that we took from, this is what programming

14:12.840 --> 14:15.040
looked like in the 1940s and 50s.

14:15.040 --> 14:18.000
In order to get the computer to do something different,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.120
you physically had to rewire it.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.480
You had to rearrange the hardware,

14:21.480 --> 14:22.880
you had to move the wires.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.480
But what computer scientists realized is that

14:25.480 --> 14:27.480
if your hardware is good enough,

14:27.480 --> 14:29.160
and I'm gonna argue that biological hardware

14:29.160 --> 14:30.480
is definitely good enough,

14:30.480 --> 14:32.120
what you can do is something really interesting.

14:32.120 --> 14:35.200
You can reprogram the machine without touching the hardware

14:35.200 --> 14:38.080
basically by giving it stimuli or experiences,

14:38.080 --> 14:39.400
basically inputs.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.000
And that will allow you to program

14:41.000 --> 14:42.480
in a much higher level language,

14:42.480 --> 14:45.680
where you're not drowned in the details of the hardware

14:45.680 --> 14:47.080
or even the machine language,

14:47.080 --> 14:48.920
which are actually able to take advantage

14:48.920 --> 14:53.000
of some really high level types of programming strategies

14:54.120 --> 14:56.560
to get very complex kinds of outcomes.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.760
And I'm certainly not arguing that living things

14:58.760 --> 15:01.440
are computers in the sense that they're,

15:01.440 --> 15:03.440
of course they're not built to the same architectures

15:03.440 --> 15:05.520
that our current computers are.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.880
But this idea of reprogrammable hardware

15:07.880 --> 15:12.880
and of controlling a system by inputs and stimuli

15:12.920 --> 15:15.680
as opposed to physical rewiring is very powerful.

15:15.680 --> 15:20.680
So what we try to do is to come up with a scheme

15:20.760 --> 15:23.440
where there's more feedback here.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.080
So that basically when the system is deviated

15:26.080 --> 15:28.120
from its normal target morphology,

15:28.120 --> 15:31.320
be that with injury or teratogenic drugs

15:31.320 --> 15:34.360
or pathogens or whatever,

15:34.360 --> 15:36.760
when the system is deviated from this,

15:36.800 --> 15:38.000
feedback loops kick in,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.720
both at the level of genetics and physics,

15:39.720 --> 15:41.680
and we're gonna talk about this physical one here,

15:41.680 --> 15:43.440
that try to minimize the error,

15:43.440 --> 15:46.200
the delta between where we are now and where we need to be.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.000
This is a classic homeostatic loop.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.760
It's what the thermostat in your house does.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.480
It measures against the set point.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.040
And if error is beyond the tolerable amount,

15:54.040 --> 15:56.240
it will undertake corrective action.

15:56.240 --> 15:59.120
So several things to note here.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.480
The first is that, of course,

16:00.480 --> 16:01.920
feedbacks are not new in biology.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.840
Everybody knows we have feedbacks.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.320
But there's something different here.

16:05.320 --> 16:08.240
The first is that the set point of this process

16:08.240 --> 16:10.880
and every homeostatic system has to have a set point

16:10.880 --> 16:13.000
towards which it tries to reduce error.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.040
The set point here is not a single number

16:15.040 --> 16:19.280
or a scalar like pH or a metabolic hunger rate,

16:19.280 --> 16:22.280
is a hunger range or something like that.

16:22.280 --> 16:25.520
It's actually a fairly complex set of information

16:25.520 --> 16:28.120
that in some rough course-grained way

16:28.120 --> 16:31.120
describes what a correct anatomy should be.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.160
So it's kind of a complex piece of information.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.320
The other thing is that

16:34.320 --> 16:36.840
this is very much a goal-directed process.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.280
Now, when I say goal-directed,

16:38.280 --> 16:41.680
I don't mean something magical or mysterious.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.800
It's goal-directed in the cybernetic sense.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.640
We've had devices that are goal-directed agents

16:46.640 --> 16:49.280
for since the 40s and 50s.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.040
And all it means is that it's able

16:51.040 --> 16:53.640
to execute this error minimization loop.

16:53.640 --> 16:56.240
But the cool thing about systems that work like this

16:56.240 --> 16:57.320
is the following.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.680
When you want to change what they do,

16:59.680 --> 17:03.040
you don't have to be rewiring the hardware back here.

17:03.040 --> 17:05.720
If you understood how the set point was encoded,

17:05.720 --> 17:06.920
you could change the set point

17:06.920 --> 17:09.640
and get the exact same cells to build something different.

17:09.640 --> 17:13.240
And that's the amazing thing about any system

17:13.240 --> 17:15.400
that utilizes this kind of architecture

17:15.400 --> 17:17.040
that you can actually make changes

17:17.040 --> 17:18.480
without even necessarily knowing

17:18.480 --> 17:20.080
how all the parts of the loop works.

17:20.080 --> 17:24.080
All you have to do is rewrite the set point.

17:24.080 --> 17:27.800
And so our strategy for some years now was this.

17:27.800 --> 17:31.760
We tried to identify some of the mechanisms that work here

17:31.760 --> 17:34.640
in particular, understand the homeostatic set point.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.880
How does the tissue store the pattern

17:36.880 --> 17:38.840
towards which it tries to remodel?

17:38.840 --> 17:42.400
And let's rewrite that pattern and let the cells build.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.720
And that's part of trying to decode this aspect

17:46.720 --> 17:50.320
of the collective behavior of these cells.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.760
So let's talk about how we've been doing it.

17:52.760 --> 17:56.920
So we have started looking at something called

17:56.920 --> 17:58.720
developmental bioelectricity.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.080
And what I'm going to show you now are,

18:01.080 --> 18:01.920
first of all, the methods.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.440
So how do we do this?

18:03.440 --> 18:06.560
And then show you some proof of principle application.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.360
So why is this interesting?

18:08.360 --> 18:11.440
And I want to point out at the beginning that,

18:11.440 --> 18:16.440
all cells in vivo sit within this complex morphogenetic field

18:16.600 --> 18:18.640
of information that tells them what to do

18:18.640 --> 18:20.440
as part of a larger unit.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.560
This information comes in many flavors.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.640
So chemical, extracellular matrix,

18:24.640 --> 18:27.560
tensions and stresses or biomechanics,

18:27.560 --> 18:28.400
all kinds of things.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.320
And of course, bioelectricity.

18:29.320 --> 18:32.080
So bioelectricity doesn't do this alone.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.560
It works with all of this other stuff.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.600
I'm just going to focus today on bioelectricity

18:35.600 --> 18:40.600
because I think it has a particular aspect to it,

18:40.720 --> 18:43.760
which is that it's not just another piece of physics

18:43.760 --> 18:46.720
that you need to know to understand anatomies.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.200
It's actually a computational layer

18:49.200 --> 18:51.120
that gives some privileged access

18:51.120 --> 18:54.200
to the control of complex anatomical features.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.680
It is the medium in which the computations are being made

18:57.680 --> 19:00.480
to make decisions about the length and the size

19:00.480 --> 19:01.320
and the shape of things.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.800
And so accessing this bioelectricity

19:03.800 --> 19:08.800
gives you a remarkable insight into what's going on

19:09.520 --> 19:13.480
beyond bottom up molecular mechanisms.

19:13.480 --> 19:18.320
So the kind of inspiration for how to think about this

19:18.320 --> 19:21.040
we took directly from neuroscience.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.760
In neuroscience, this story of course

19:23.760 --> 19:24.840
will be familiar to everybody.

19:24.840 --> 19:26.760
The hardware is simple.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.160
You have a collection of cells.

19:29.160 --> 19:32.280
Each cell has ion channels in the plasma membrane.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.840
They set voltage values across.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.560
That's the resting potential, which can go up and down.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.560
And it can propagate to the neighbors

19:39.560 --> 19:41.520
via these electrical synapses.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.840
So that's what's there.

19:43.840 --> 19:48.760
And those kind of networks underlie this amazing software.

19:48.760 --> 19:51.760
And here you can see this physiology

19:51.760 --> 19:55.600
in a living zebrafish brain as the fish is undergoing

19:55.600 --> 19:58.240
whatever cognitive activities zebrafish can do.

19:58.240 --> 20:02.480
And you can see here the electrical activity.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.640
And the commitment of neuroscience

20:04.640 --> 20:07.640
is that if we were able to decode this,

20:07.640 --> 20:09.800
if we understood how to read this information,

20:09.800 --> 20:12.600
we should be able to, through a computational approach,

20:12.600 --> 20:14.040
we should be able to figure out

20:14.040 --> 20:15.920
what the animal is remembering,

20:15.920 --> 20:16.760
what it's thinking about,

20:16.760 --> 20:18.680
what decisions it's making.

20:18.680 --> 20:22.480
The semantic and functional cognitive structures

20:22.520 --> 20:25.600
are to be read out from the electrical activity of the brain.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.320
That's what we believe.

20:27.320 --> 20:31.000
Well, it turns out that actually all cells do this.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.720
All cells have ion channels.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.840
Most cells have electrical synapses

20:34.840 --> 20:36.960
known as gap junctions to their neighbors.

20:36.960 --> 20:41.000
And we have undertaken this project

20:41.000 --> 20:43.400
to try to do the same kind of decoding.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.080
So here's an embryo.

20:45.080 --> 20:47.960
And we would like to read all the electrical conversations

20:47.960 --> 20:51.360
that bind the individual cells into a collective

20:51.360 --> 20:55.880
that can undergo anatomical homeostasis

20:55.880 --> 20:58.800
towards large states like build a limb,

20:58.800 --> 21:00.920
build a kidney and so on.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.000
And on the one hand,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.560
it's strange and surprising to many people

21:04.560 --> 21:06.280
to think about somatic cells

21:06.280 --> 21:10.320
as having this kind of neuroscience-like aspect to them

21:10.320 --> 21:11.920
as if they're processing information,

21:11.920 --> 21:14.360
they're having goal states and so on.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.800
On the other hand, if you ask where did neurons come from,

21:16.800 --> 21:18.840
of course, they didn't just appear out of nowhere.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.840
The evolution just speed optimized

21:21.840 --> 21:24.600
things that cells have been doing for a really long time

21:24.600 --> 21:27.600
since around the time of bacterial biofilms.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.520
All of the components of neurons

21:30.520 --> 21:32.120
that are really important for this,

21:32.120 --> 21:34.680
the channels, the neurotransmitter machinery,

21:34.680 --> 21:38.720
all this stuff existed even before multicellularity.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.560
And even bacteria were using this

21:40.560 --> 21:44.040
to coordinate information across the film.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.800
So we developed some tools to study this.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.760
The first is just how to detect and model them.

21:50.760 --> 21:54.080
This is a voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye,

21:54.080 --> 21:57.840
which basically just reveals in the living state,

21:57.840 --> 21:59.960
non-invasively, so you don't have to poke the cells

21:59.960 --> 22:03.360
with electrophysiological tools.

22:03.360 --> 22:06.000
Every cell is now reporting around its membrane,

22:06.000 --> 22:06.840
all the voltages.

22:06.840 --> 22:11.640
This is an early frog embryo in time-lapse sorting out

22:11.640 --> 22:13.160
which cells are gonna be left and right

22:13.160 --> 22:15.000
and dorsal ventral and so on.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.600
And in addition to that,

22:16.600 --> 22:18.440
we do a lot of computational modeling.

22:18.440 --> 22:21.640
So try to say, well, if we know what ion channels

22:21.640 --> 22:23.080
and pumps are in the membrane,

22:23.080 --> 22:25.680
can we explain why the voltage is the way it is

22:25.680 --> 22:28.640
and why it changes as a function of time the way it does?

22:28.640 --> 22:32.000
And so let me show you a couple of native bioelectrical patterns.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.920
This is what we call the electric face.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.920
This was discovered by Danny Adams in my group

22:36.920 --> 22:40.960
and she used voltage dyes to look at the frog embryo

22:40.960 --> 22:42.440
putting its face together, okay?

22:42.440 --> 22:44.200
And so this is, of course, is a time-lapse.

22:44.200 --> 22:47.520
And what you can see, this is one frame taken from that movie.

22:47.520 --> 22:51.480
What you can see is that long before the genes come on

22:51.480 --> 22:53.960
to regionalize the face into the eye, the mouth,

22:53.960 --> 22:55.040
and everything else,

22:55.040 --> 23:00.040
all of the bioelectrical properties set up a pre-pattern,

23:00.320 --> 23:03.040
a scaffold that tell you where everything is going to be.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.160
So here's where the animal's right eye is going to be.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.840
The left eye will come in shortly.

23:06.840 --> 23:10.440
Here is the mouth, here are some placodes.

23:10.440 --> 23:11.760
This bioelectrical pattern

23:11.760 --> 23:15.920
is a native instructive pattern for gene expression

23:15.920 --> 23:16.800
and for anatomy.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.600
And the reason we know it's instructive

23:18.600 --> 23:21.080
is because if you go in, let's say with optogenetics

23:21.080 --> 23:24.600
or with other tools and change this electrical pattern,

23:24.600 --> 23:26.800
not move any cells, but just change the pattern,

23:26.800 --> 23:29.400
then you can get, for example, those Picasso tadpoles.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.960
You can move organs around at will.

23:31.960 --> 23:34.000
And I'm going to show you that in a minute.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.480
So this is a normal pattern that is necessary

23:38.480 --> 23:41.280
for correct craniofacial development.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.640
Here's a pathological pattern.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.640
So this embryo was injected with a human oncogene.

23:45.640 --> 23:49.120
And so something like a KRAS mutation

23:49.120 --> 23:50.120
or something like that.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.360
And here it's going to form a tumor, right?

23:52.360 --> 23:54.280
And the tumor is going to start to spread.

23:54.280 --> 23:55.560
But before that happens,

23:55.560 --> 23:57.840
before it becomes histologically apparent,

23:57.840 --> 23:59.760
you can already see with this voltage dye,

23:59.760 --> 24:02.080
here are the cells that have depolarized

24:02.080 --> 24:04.800
and shut off the electrical connections to their neighbors

24:04.800 --> 24:07.680
in a way that's going to basically revert them back

24:07.680 --> 24:09.960
to their unicellular ancient lifestyle.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.520
Once you're electrically disconnected from this grid,

24:12.520 --> 24:15.320
the rest of the animal becomes just external environment,

24:15.320 --> 24:17.040
that computational boundary,

24:17.040 --> 24:18.400
whereas before it was large,

24:18.400 --> 24:22.520
it was a group working on a liver or a kidney

24:22.520 --> 24:23.480
or something like that.

24:23.480 --> 24:25.800
It now shrinks to the level of a single cell

24:25.800 --> 24:28.320
and all your goals become single cell goals,

24:28.320 --> 24:30.760
proliferate, migrate to where life is good and so on.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.440
And this ends up being metastasis

24:33.440 --> 24:36.120
and conversion of metastasis.

24:36.120 --> 24:38.240
So this is a pathological pattern.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.880
So what we then developed was a set of tools

24:40.880 --> 24:44.200
that were designed to allow us

24:44.200 --> 24:47.760
to manipulate these bioelectrical gradients in vivo.

24:47.760 --> 24:49.480
So if we thought they were functional,

24:49.480 --> 24:51.320
we ought to be able to control them

24:51.320 --> 24:53.920
to get the collective to do something different.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.520
And so this is important to say

24:55.520 --> 24:58.600
that we do not do any external field application.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.440
We don't have any electromagnetic components here.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.680
There are no electrodes, there are no waves,

25:03.680 --> 25:04.800
there's no magnetism.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.680
It's all molecular physiology

25:07.680 --> 25:09.960
and the way it works is you can,

25:09.960 --> 25:11.840
you have two things you can control in any tissue.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.560
You can control which cells electrically

25:14.560 --> 25:15.880
coupled to which other cells.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.400
And so we target these gap junctions,

25:17.400 --> 25:19.720
we can mutate them, we can open them, close them.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.120
Or, and this is basically synaptic,

25:22.120 --> 25:24.240
the controlling synaptic plasticity,

25:24.240 --> 25:27.920
or we can control the various ion channels opening,

25:27.920 --> 25:29.400
again, opening and closing them

25:29.400 --> 25:32.280
to actually set the voltage of the individual cells.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.320
And this would be the equivalent

25:33.320 --> 25:34.840
of some sort of intrinsic plasticity

25:34.840 --> 25:36.400
if this was neuroscience.

25:36.400 --> 25:40.520
And again, we can use dominant mutations of channels,

25:40.520 --> 25:44.360
we can use drugs, we can use optogenetics, light and so on.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.280
And so when you do this,

25:46.280 --> 25:48.360
something very interesting happens now.

25:48.360 --> 25:51.360
When I first, this was, you know, back,

25:51.360 --> 25:54.360
while around the year 2000,

25:55.520 --> 25:56.760
I was first setting up these tools

25:56.760 --> 26:01.760
and we wanted to control these bioelectric states.

26:01.880 --> 26:03.320
It was thought that resting potential

26:03.320 --> 26:04.720
is a housekeeping parameter.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.320
And basically the standard assumption

26:06.320 --> 26:09.680
was that if we perturbed the cells would die

26:09.680 --> 26:11.920
and you would get uninterpretable toxicity,

26:11.920 --> 26:13.240
that was the thought.

26:13.240 --> 26:14.160
So I'm gonna show you that,

26:14.160 --> 26:15.720
in fact, that's not at all what happens

26:15.720 --> 26:19.800
because these bioelectrical states are not just readouts

26:19.800 --> 26:21.080
and they're not just,

26:22.800 --> 26:24.920
just yet more molecular machinery,

26:24.920 --> 26:27.880
but they're actually the information bearing medium

26:27.880 --> 26:30.760
for these large scale modifications.

26:30.760 --> 26:33.720
So one thing you can do is you can take some cells

26:33.720 --> 26:35.520
in the frog that are going to become gut.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.120
So they're endodermal cells

26:37.120 --> 26:40.600
and you can inject one of several types of ion channels

26:40.600 --> 26:42.920
that will set up or in this region

26:42.920 --> 26:44.480
that's going to be part of the gut,

26:44.480 --> 26:47.600
will set up a voltage pattern, a distribution of voltage

26:47.600 --> 26:49.720
that's very similar to what happens

26:49.720 --> 26:51.320
when the native eyes come in.

26:51.320 --> 26:52.160
And sure enough,

26:52.160 --> 26:54.400
if you recapitulate that pattern somewhere else,

26:54.400 --> 26:55.920
the cells are using that pattern

26:55.920 --> 26:58.360
to decide what they're going to build

26:58.360 --> 27:00.040
and that pattern tells them to build an eye.

27:00.040 --> 27:00.880
And here they go,

27:00.880 --> 27:03.320
they will build an eye out of endodermal cells.

27:03.320 --> 27:05.600
Now in the textbook,

27:05.600 --> 27:08.640
we'll say that only anterior ectoderm is competent

27:08.640 --> 27:10.080
to become eye up here.

27:10.080 --> 27:10.920
And that's true,

27:10.920 --> 27:13.560
if you use canonical inducers like PAC-6,

27:13.560 --> 27:17.040
the master regulator transcription factor,

27:17.040 --> 27:18.720
but if you go upstream of that

27:18.720 --> 27:21.240
and actually re-specify the bioelectric pattern,

27:21.240 --> 27:23.560
then you can induce these eyes anywhere on the tail

27:23.560 --> 27:25.160
and the gut anywhere you want.

27:25.160 --> 27:28.160
And if you make these tails, these eyes rather,

27:28.160 --> 27:32.160
they can have all of the same components

27:32.160 --> 27:33.000
that normalize have.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.760
So they'll have lens and retina and optic nerve and so on.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.520
And here's an interesting thing.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.760
If you label the cells

27:39.760 --> 27:41.920
that you've directly injected with the scion channel,

27:41.920 --> 27:44.280
let's say we'll label them with beta galactosidase,

27:44.280 --> 27:45.480
so they're blue.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.200
And this is a cross-section through a lens

27:47.200 --> 27:48.880
sitting out in the flank somewhere.

27:48.880 --> 27:52.120
What you'll see is that there are two inductions here.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.440
The first induction is by us

27:54.440 --> 27:59.440
putting in imposing a particular bioelectrical state

27:59.880 --> 28:02.200
that causes these cells to decide to become a lens.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.400
That's the first induction.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.840
The second induction is that these cells

28:05.840 --> 28:07.760
with their aberrant voltage potential

28:07.760 --> 28:09.800
actually recruit their neighbors.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.600
The brown cells here, which are not labeled,

28:11.600 --> 28:13.920
which were never directly modified by us,

28:13.920 --> 28:15.520
recruit them into this project

28:15.520 --> 28:18.320
of building this larger scale structure,

28:18.320 --> 28:20.000
this nice round lens.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.120
So it's a non-cell autonomous effect.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.640
And when we see this again and again,

28:23.640 --> 28:27.520
that there's this ability of these bioelectrical signals

28:27.520 --> 28:31.040
to not just to specify cell fate,

28:31.040 --> 28:33.720
but to actually specify organ type and position

28:33.720 --> 28:34.760
and things like that.

28:34.760 --> 28:36.840
So we can make eyes, we can make ectopic hearts.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.240
Here's a secondary heart.

28:38.240 --> 28:41.240
We can make limbs and brains and some other things

28:41.240 --> 28:43.560
and then many things that we can't yet make.

28:43.560 --> 28:46.680
Now, let's look at another example.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.160
Here's a planarian.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.000
And one of the most interesting things

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
is that if you chop off the head and the tail,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.040
this middle fragment knows exactly

28:54.040 --> 28:55.400
how many heads it's supposed to have.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.720
It puts one head here.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.080
It puts a tail here.

28:58.080 --> 29:01.360
And the way it does that is because as soon as you amputate,

29:01.360 --> 29:03.560
there's this voltage gradient that's set up

29:03.560 --> 29:06.440
where the red, the depolarized region tells the worm

29:06.440 --> 29:08.360
how many heads it's supposed to have.

29:08.360 --> 29:11.080
So what we can do is we can go in and target this region

29:11.080 --> 29:14.320
using drugs, using basically ion channel modifying drugs

29:14.320 --> 29:16.400
to depolarize this region.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.480
And when you do that, you get a two-headed animal.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.560
These cells are perfectly happy to make a head.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.960
The information of how many heads you're supposed to have

29:22.960 --> 29:24.320
comes from this electrical gradient.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.880
If you change the gradient, they'll happily make two heads.

29:26.880 --> 29:28.520
You can make two-headed animals.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.520
You can make no-headed animals.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.400
All kinds of interesting behavioral experiments

29:32.400 --> 29:35.720
to be done that we can discuss if there's time.

29:35.720 --> 29:41.080
But what's important here is that there are much like...

29:41.080 --> 29:43.120
There's no genomic editing here.

29:43.120 --> 29:46.960
So this is purely physiological.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.200
And not only can I ask this animal

29:49.200 --> 29:52.640
to make a second head of the correct type,

29:52.640 --> 29:55.200
I can actually ask it to make heads belonging

29:55.200 --> 29:56.600
to other species.

29:56.600 --> 29:59.480
So here's we started off with a triangular-headed worm

29:59.480 --> 30:02.040
like this, amputate the head per-turb

30:02.040 --> 30:04.000
for about 48 hours, the ability of cells

30:04.000 --> 30:05.680
to talk to each other electrically.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.880
And what happens is the electric circuit is unable

30:07.880 --> 30:10.240
to settle to the correct attractor.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.320
And when they do settle stochastically,

30:12.320 --> 30:14.600
sometimes they settle to the correct shape,

30:14.600 --> 30:17.560
but sometimes they make round heads or flat heads.

30:17.560 --> 30:21.840
And in doing so, they recapitulate the state

30:21.840 --> 30:24.120
of flat-headed species like this Pifolina

30:24.120 --> 30:27.160
or round-headed species like this S-Mediterranean.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.600
It's not just the shape of the head,

30:28.600 --> 30:31.640
it's also the shape of the brain

30:31.640 --> 30:33.520
and the distribution of stem cells

30:33.520 --> 30:36.480
that is exactly like these other species.

30:36.480 --> 30:40.120
Again, no genomic editing here, perfectly wild-type genome.

30:40.120 --> 30:43.240
And these animals, once the electric circuit settles,

30:43.240 --> 30:45.040
there's a good chance that it'll settle

30:45.040 --> 30:47.120
into an inappropriate attractor

30:47.120 --> 30:50.040
that's actually associated with a completely different head

30:50.040 --> 30:53.520
shape that in fact other species are using natively.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.560
Now, you can also knock the system into attractors

30:56.560 --> 30:59.360
that are not being used to my knowledge by any system.

30:59.360 --> 31:04.360
And you can really get far from the normal planarian shape.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.960
You can make animals that are spiky like this.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.680
You can make animals that are cylindrical like this

31:10.680 --> 31:12.680
or a combination of a flat animal

31:12.680 --> 31:15.760
with a tube growing out into the third dimension.

31:15.760 --> 31:17.800
Now, I'm gonna show you in a minute

31:17.840 --> 31:20.360
that what this is all about

31:20.360 --> 31:22.960
is predictive control over large-scale anatomy.

31:22.960 --> 31:27.960
This is not about making weird aberrant teratologies and so on.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.400
The idea is that we can show how much of this

31:31.400 --> 31:33.680
is actually under bioelectrical control

31:33.680 --> 31:35.800
and then use computational techniques

31:35.800 --> 31:40.360
to gain good predictive control over it.

31:40.360 --> 31:44.920
And so this is a good time to think about the role

31:44.920 --> 31:49.560
of the genome in the anatomy of this whole process.

31:49.560 --> 31:52.440
The typical metaphor that we hear is that

31:53.320 --> 31:55.720
the DNA or the genome is the software

31:55.720 --> 31:58.640
and that the cell is the hardware that interprets this.

31:58.640 --> 32:02.080
And that's not a bad analogy at the single cell level

32:02.080 --> 32:04.720
when you're thinking about phenotypes of proteins

32:04.720 --> 32:07.800
and pathways, but at the level of anatomy,

32:07.800 --> 32:10.720
I would suggest a different metaphor.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.360
And the different metaphor that works better

32:13.120 --> 32:16.040
to understand anatomical control is this.

32:16.040 --> 32:20.960
Actually, what the genome does is specify all of the hardware

32:20.960 --> 32:22.320
that the cell gets to have.

32:22.320 --> 32:25.120
So all of the specific ion channels that are here

32:25.120 --> 32:28.160
are determined by the gene expression.

32:28.160 --> 32:31.760
But we know from basic neuroscience

32:31.760 --> 32:33.920
and also from computer technology

32:33.920 --> 32:36.160
that if you make a very simple circuit,

32:36.160 --> 32:38.040
this is a flip-flop circuit right here,

32:38.040 --> 32:39.880
if you nail down the hardware,

32:39.880 --> 32:41.280
what you can have is a circuit

32:41.280 --> 32:45.760
that can store multiple different pieces of information

32:45.760 --> 32:47.880
depending on the current flow through the system

32:47.880 --> 32:50.640
and store it stably, which is a memory,

32:50.640 --> 32:52.560
a flip-flop is a basic kind of memory.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.360
And you don't need to move or change any of the hardware

32:55.360 --> 32:58.400
in order to store a zero or a one

32:58.400 --> 33:01.360
in this very simple electrical circuit.

33:01.360 --> 33:02.840
So in fact, with our modeling,

33:02.840 --> 33:05.480
you can see that the same thing is true

33:05.480 --> 33:09.120
if you set up a field of cells with a particular

33:09.120 --> 33:11.120
where every single cell is expressing

33:11.120 --> 33:13.360
exactly the same set of ion channels,

33:13.360 --> 33:15.800
what you actually make is an excitable tissue

33:15.800 --> 33:18.720
where very rich patterning can take place.

33:18.720 --> 33:21.440
It's a little bit like touring patterns, right?

33:21.440 --> 33:23.640
There's self-spontaneous symmetry breaking

33:23.640 --> 33:25.040
and self-organization,

33:25.040 --> 33:28.400
but all of this happens with a completely constant proteome.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.600
You don't need to change these ion channels

33:30.600 --> 33:31.920
because they can open and close.

33:31.920 --> 33:33.400
And so now all of the dynamics

33:33.400 --> 33:35.080
are at the electrical circuit level,

33:35.080 --> 33:38.040
not with the proteins underneath.

33:38.040 --> 33:40.640
And so the prediction of this way of thinking about it

33:40.640 --> 33:43.320
is this, you should be able to edit the software,

33:43.320 --> 33:46.240
meaning change the information stored in the system

33:46.240 --> 33:48.560
while keeping the hardware constant.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.520
And in particular, just to remind you,

33:50.520 --> 33:54.480
the piece of information that we want to change

33:54.480 --> 33:55.680
is the set point.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.920
We want to change the set point towards

33:57.920 --> 34:02.040
which cells are working in this error minimization scheme.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.120
So let's think about how to do that.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.720
So here's our normal planarian.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.320
We've cut off the head and the tail.

34:07.320 --> 34:08.440
We got the middle fragment.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.880
We perturbed the electric circuit

34:09.880 --> 34:12.120
according to this model that we've developed.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.000
And here's your two-headed animal.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.960
Now we ask a simple question.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.160
Here's our two-headed animal.

34:17.160 --> 34:22.200
We give it a couple of weeks to get everything settled down,

34:22.200 --> 34:24.200
cut off the primary head,

34:24.200 --> 34:26.880
cut off this crazy ectopic secondary head.

34:26.880 --> 34:29.640
Some people think, oh, you somehow epigenetically reprogram

34:29.640 --> 34:30.680
this posterior tissue.

34:30.680 --> 34:32.760
Fine, we'll cut it off, we'll throw it away.

34:32.760 --> 34:36.400
All that remains is a normal middle fragment here

34:36.400 --> 34:38.520
that didn't have any head tissue in it.

34:38.520 --> 34:39.720
We do this in plain water,

34:39.720 --> 34:41.760
no more manipulations of any kind.

34:41.760 --> 34:42.960
The genome is wild type.

34:42.960 --> 34:46.080
We haven't edited the genomic sequence at all.

34:46.080 --> 34:50.080
So surely the prediction would be that you should have,

34:50.080 --> 34:51.640
but you should get back to a single-headed worm.

34:51.640 --> 34:53.080
Once you cut off this thing,

34:53.080 --> 34:55.640
you should be back to a single-headed worm.

34:55.640 --> 34:58.040
Now the interesting thing is that if you actually model

34:58.040 --> 35:01.040
the state space of the electric circuit that's involved here,

35:01.040 --> 35:03.960
what you find is that there are multiple stable points.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.600
One is here, a very stable point

35:06.600 --> 35:09.120
around the single-headed shape like this,

35:09.120 --> 35:10.680
but there's another stable point

35:10.680 --> 35:13.120
around the double-headed shape.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.040
And so that suggests an interesting idea

35:15.040 --> 35:17.920
that is it possible that when you amputate this thing,

35:17.920 --> 35:20.320
the bioelectrical circuit will still remember

35:20.320 --> 35:22.200
that it needs to make two heads.

35:22.200 --> 35:25.040
And sure enough, that's exactly what happens.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.160
When you amputate these in perpetuity,

35:27.160 --> 35:28.760
as far as we can tell forever,

35:28.760 --> 35:31.320
two-headed animals will continue to give rise

35:31.320 --> 35:32.600
to two-headed animals,

35:32.600 --> 35:35.440
even despite their wild-type genome in plain water,

35:35.440 --> 35:36.720
no more manipulation.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.560
And we can, in fact, if we want to,

35:38.560 --> 35:41.760
we can set the bioelectric circuit back to normal

35:41.760 --> 35:44.160
and it goes back to being a single-headed animal.

35:44.160 --> 35:49.160
So a normal planarian body, as you're going to see,

35:50.440 --> 35:52.960
is able to store a couple of different,

35:52.960 --> 35:54.200
at least probably more,

35:54.200 --> 35:56.760
but we've nailed down to ideas

35:56.760 --> 35:59.680
of what a correct planarian is supposed to look like.

35:59.680 --> 36:02.960
And this is how you can see this.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.240
So here's a single-headed planarian.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.120
And if we look at the molecular markers,

36:07.120 --> 36:10.200
the anterior marker is here in the head, not in the tail.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.120
And if you amputate,

36:11.120 --> 36:14.280
you get a perfectly normal single-headed animal, fine.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.320
Here's another anatomically normal animal.

36:16.320 --> 36:18.040
Again, molecular markers are all normal,

36:18.040 --> 36:21.000
anterior in the head, no anterior back here,

36:21.000 --> 36:22.880
that no anterior marker back here.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.800
But if you amputate this one,

36:24.800 --> 36:26.200
suddenly you get a two-headed animal.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.640
Why would you get a two-headed animal?

36:27.640 --> 36:30.480
Because in the meantime, what we've done

36:30.480 --> 36:34.800
is we've bioelectrically changed the stable pattern

36:34.800 --> 36:37.120
to say, no, now you need to have two heads.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.880
Now, here's the critical part of this.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.760
This electrical map here

36:41.760 --> 36:44.600
is not a map of this two-headed animal.

36:44.600 --> 36:48.120
This electrical map is a map of this one-headed animal,

36:48.120 --> 36:51.720
meaning that the bioelectricity distribution

36:51.720 --> 36:54.600
is not simply a map of whatever the anatomy is doing.

36:54.600 --> 36:57.480
The same single-headed anatomy

36:57.480 --> 37:00.080
can store at least one of two different

37:00.080 --> 37:02.840
stable representations of what it's going to do

37:02.840 --> 37:04.720
if it gets injured in the future.

37:04.720 --> 37:06.120
If you're interested in neuroscience

37:06.120 --> 37:09.400
and how counterfactuals are remembered in the brain,

37:09.400 --> 37:12.600
this, I think, is sort of the evolutionary precursor

37:12.600 --> 37:16.360
to being able to remember things that are not happening now,

37:16.360 --> 37:17.840
either things that happened before

37:17.840 --> 37:19.000
or might happen in the future.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.440
It's a counterfactual memory.

37:20.440 --> 37:24.160
It's the ability to store a representation of a worm

37:24.160 --> 37:26.480
towards which the fragment is going to build

37:26.480 --> 37:27.600
if it gets injured.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.040
So it sits perfectly comfortably

37:29.040 --> 37:32.200
as a single-headed animal with this pattern until you cut.

37:32.200 --> 37:36.280
And at that point, that memory is no longer latent

37:36.280 --> 37:37.560
and it's actually becomes functional.

37:37.560 --> 37:42.120
And that's how we get this propagation

37:42.120 --> 37:43.440
of these two-headed worms.

37:43.440 --> 37:48.520
So we are building some very sort of quantitative,

37:48.520 --> 37:51.040
molecular, biophysical models

37:51.040 --> 37:53.800
to really understand the state space of the circuit,

37:53.800 --> 37:57.480
to understand how the circuit minimizes free energy

37:57.480 --> 37:59.360
and eventually lands in one of these attractors,

37:59.360 --> 38:00.280
hopefully the right one,

38:00.280 --> 38:02.120
but not necessarily the right one,

38:02.120 --> 38:05.400
and tying it into exactly the same formalism

38:05.400 --> 38:09.400
for how people in machine learning think about networks,

38:09.400 --> 38:12.120
electrical networks that can store patterns

38:12.120 --> 38:15.400
and can actually repair those patterns

38:15.400 --> 38:17.040
when pieces of the information are missing.

38:17.040 --> 38:21.320
This is all very well-trodden ground in machine learning.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.840
And we think that some of these same strategies

38:23.840 --> 38:27.600
that we use now were discovered by evolution long ago.

38:27.600 --> 38:32.600
And beyond worms, this is the beginnings of our roadmap

38:36.520 --> 38:39.240
for regenerative medicine.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.760
Because what we found is that, for example,

38:41.760 --> 38:45.200
if you have a frog and the frogs do not regenerate their legs

38:45.200 --> 38:47.480
the way that salamanders do, you amputate the leg.

38:47.480 --> 38:50.320
45 days later, there's basically nothing.

38:50.320 --> 38:53.080
There's no blastema and there's no regenerate.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.880
What we can do is we can apply a cocktail

38:54.880 --> 38:59.800
of ion channel drugs that serve as a stimulus

38:59.800 --> 39:02.760
to kickstart a very complex cascade.

39:02.760 --> 39:06.640
So what you see here is immediately the MSX-1

39:06.640 --> 39:08.920
blastema marker becomes turned on.

39:08.920 --> 39:11.760
The leg starts growing.

39:11.760 --> 39:15.360
Already you have the toes and here's a toenail

39:15.360 --> 39:17.800
and eventually you get a very respectable leg here

39:17.800 --> 39:20.280
and it's touch sensitive and motile.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.480
Okay, so the animal can use it.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.080
There's a couple of interesting things about this.

39:24.080 --> 39:27.080
One, is that much like when we created an eye

39:27.080 --> 39:30.640
or induced a second head on the planarian,

39:30.640 --> 39:34.040
inducing this leg, we don't provide all the information

39:34.040 --> 39:36.200
to micromanage the process, right?

39:36.200 --> 39:38.640
We have no idea how to build a planarian head from scratch

39:38.640 --> 39:40.480
or how to make an eye or how to make a leg.

39:40.480 --> 39:43.840
What we have found is a trigger for a subroutine

39:43.840 --> 39:47.600
that this tissue already knows

39:47.600 --> 39:50.960
how to do and the decision for what it's going to do,

39:50.960 --> 39:53.960
scar or produce various types of organs can be,

39:53.960 --> 39:56.320
is part of an electric circuit that we can guide.

39:56.320 --> 39:58.080
We can manage.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.600
So that's the first interesting thing.

39:59.600 --> 40:03.280
The second thing is that in keeping with this idea

40:03.280 --> 40:06.160
from the beginning that one of the hallmarks

40:06.160 --> 40:08.000
of the collective intelligence of these cells

40:08.000 --> 40:12.240
and responding to novel situations is that they can get

40:12.240 --> 40:17.000
to the final outcome through novel paths.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.880
And if you actually look at this intermediate stage

40:19.880 --> 40:23.320
of this leg, this is nothing like what frog legs look like

40:23.320 --> 40:25.040
when they're developing in the first place.

40:25.040 --> 40:28.240
So it eventually gets to a very good frog leg shape here,

40:28.240 --> 40:30.440
basically indistinguishable from the control,

40:30.440 --> 40:32.640
but the intermediate path through morpho space,

40:32.640 --> 40:34.280
the ability of the system to navigate

40:34.280 --> 40:36.880
that anatomical morpho space is amazing

40:36.880 --> 40:39.320
because it does not follow the same path

40:39.320 --> 40:42.000
that frog limbs normally follow where they make a paddle

40:42.000 --> 40:43.680
and then they, you know, there's apoptosis

40:43.680 --> 40:46.760
that kills off the space between the digits and so on.

40:46.800 --> 40:47.640
It's not what they do.

40:47.640 --> 40:50.200
They grow, it's almost like a plant meristem

40:50.200 --> 40:52.120
where you get the central stalk with this nail

40:52.120 --> 40:54.240
and then off to the side, you get these toes

40:54.240 --> 40:56.400
and eventually the whole thing remodels into a leg.

40:56.400 --> 40:59.640
So the remarkable ability to get its job done

40:59.640 --> 41:01.720
in a different way.

41:01.720 --> 41:06.720
So now we, this is not just things that apply

41:06.760 --> 41:10.280
to frog and worm, we've done some work with David Kaplan

41:10.280 --> 41:14.520
and Lauren Black and others on human mesenchymal stem cells

41:14.520 --> 41:15.960
and cardiomyocytes.

41:15.960 --> 41:18.280
And you can control the kinds of things

41:18.280 --> 41:20.480
that you can see in vitro differentiation,

41:20.480 --> 41:22.080
proliferation, wound healing,

41:22.080 --> 41:24.760
but I think that's not what the bioelectricity is for.

41:24.760 --> 41:26.480
What the bioelectricity is really for

41:26.480 --> 41:28.240
in terms of why evolution uses it

41:28.240 --> 41:30.080
and why we should be interested in

41:30.080 --> 41:34.600
is because it allows us to exploit the modular nature

41:34.600 --> 41:36.400
of the anatomical decision-making

41:36.400 --> 41:39.200
because we can control very large scale outcomes

41:39.200 --> 41:42.440
not micromanage the details.

41:42.440 --> 41:45.080
And here I have to do a disclosure.

41:45.120 --> 41:49.160
So David Kaplan and I are both co-founders

41:49.160 --> 41:51.000
of this company called Morphosuticals Inc.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.480
where we're trying to take the things that we learned

41:53.480 --> 41:57.280
about frog leg regeneration and move them towards mammals.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.320
So our goal is where we're now in rodents

41:59.320 --> 42:01.960
trying for limb regeneration using the same strategies

42:01.960 --> 42:04.440
and using these wearable bioreactors.

42:04.440 --> 42:07.520
And the idea is to again, kickstart regeneration,

42:07.520 --> 42:10.600
not micromanage it, not try to babysit all of the

42:10.600 --> 42:13.000
different cell types and growth factors

42:13.000 --> 42:14.280
and everything else has to go in.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.320
But kickstart a trigger very early on

42:17.320 --> 42:20.400
and convince the cells with an aqueous protective environment

42:20.400 --> 42:24.240
that it's basically that regeneration can proceed

42:24.240 --> 42:26.280
in the way that it would in a salamander

42:26.280 --> 42:31.280
or in an embryonic mammal during this adult phase.

42:32.400 --> 42:36.760
So that's kind of where one of the research programs is going.

42:37.560 --> 42:42.120
I should point out this that it is already known

42:42.120 --> 42:45.000
how it is that voltage change impacts

42:45.000 --> 42:47.040
the transcriptional machinery.

42:47.040 --> 42:50.600
People often sort of say that it would be great

42:50.600 --> 42:53.400
if we understood how voltage controls gene expression.

42:53.400 --> 42:57.440
We basically do, we already know about six ways

42:57.440 --> 43:00.520
that voltage change transduces down

43:00.520 --> 43:03.600
into second messenger pathways and controls gene expression.

43:04.760 --> 43:07.400
And this has typical mechanisms like calcium,

43:07.400 --> 43:10.160
which neuroscience is very familiar with,

43:10.160 --> 43:13.360
other things like voltage sensitive phosphatases,

43:13.360 --> 43:14.880
neurotransmitter transporters.

43:14.880 --> 43:18.400
We already know how this works at a single cell level.

43:18.400 --> 43:22.040
This transduction machinery has been dissected.

43:22.040 --> 43:24.440
In fact, also some of the downstream targets

43:24.440 --> 43:25.480
have been identified.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.880
So the genes that are controlled by this,

43:27.880 --> 43:32.480
all of your favorite BMPs, sonic hedgehogs, FGFs,

43:32.480 --> 43:34.200
all of these kinds of things are in fact,

43:34.200 --> 43:35.840
the redistribution of morphogens

43:35.840 --> 43:37.920
and the examples that I showed you.

43:37.920 --> 43:41.800
All of this is known both from specific candidates

43:41.800 --> 43:44.720
and through unbiased, let's say RNA-seq

43:44.720 --> 43:47.760
and the microarray types of things.

43:47.760 --> 43:50.320
We know this, but what's interesting is that

43:50.320 --> 43:54.000
these answers as to how it works on a single cell level

43:54.000 --> 43:59.000
have been fairly unhelpful in understanding

43:59.120 --> 44:01.680
the large scale picture that we're really interested in.

44:01.680 --> 44:03.080
And it's very much analogous

44:03.080 --> 44:05.000
to this multi-scale problem in neuroscience.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.600
You can track the pathway and we do.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.080
And in every paper, you have to sort of go

44:09.080 --> 44:10.960
from the channel to the transduction machinery,

44:10.960 --> 44:13.120
which genes are downstream, so you can do all this.

44:13.120 --> 44:16.560
But that actually leaves open some much deeper questions

44:16.560 --> 44:18.280
about how the collective makes decisions.

44:18.280 --> 44:22.520
And so for that reason, we've made the simulator,

44:22.520 --> 44:24.960
and this was created by our center member

44:24.960 --> 44:26.760
and collaborator, Alexis Pytak.

44:26.760 --> 44:29.920
And what allows us to do is to build models

44:29.920 --> 44:33.600
of both molecular networks like GRNs

44:33.640 --> 44:38.240
together with the various biophysics steps that happen.

44:38.240 --> 44:41.800
And you can simulate every cell having these various circuits.

44:41.800 --> 44:44.440
And then you can try to build a full stack model

44:44.440 --> 44:47.720
that integrates from the molecular steps

44:47.720 --> 44:49.480
to the tissue level physiology,

44:49.480 --> 44:51.160
like every cell has various channels.

44:51.160 --> 44:52.480
What is the electrical pattern

44:52.480 --> 44:54.000
and they're gonna be in this tissue?

44:54.000 --> 44:56.840
What does that look like on an axial polarity level?

44:56.840 --> 44:58.640
You know, where's the head, where's the tail?

44:58.640 --> 45:01.520
And then can we extract from this

45:01.520 --> 45:03.800
the actual rules of the decision-making?

45:03.800 --> 45:06.440
Can we turn this into a kind of algorithmic description

45:06.440 --> 45:08.800
that looks like this that makes it much easier

45:08.800 --> 45:10.440
for us to control the process?

45:10.440 --> 45:11.720
Because now this is almost to like

45:11.720 --> 45:13.960
a high level programming language where we can see,

45:13.960 --> 45:15.480
okay, here are the measurables

45:15.480 --> 45:18.120
and here are the decision points that the circuit is using

45:18.120 --> 45:21.400
to control large scale patterning modules

45:21.400 --> 45:22.600
like make a head, make an eye.

45:22.600 --> 45:27.600
And so what we're doing is literally integrating

45:27.840 --> 45:30.080
every part of this so that you can build it up

45:30.080 --> 45:32.600
and then exert all your manipulations at this level.

45:32.600 --> 45:35.760
So you could have your simulator and ask questions like,

45:35.760 --> 45:38.680
why does the head-tail gradient rescale

45:38.680 --> 45:40.440
when you cut the planarian into four pieces?

45:40.440 --> 45:41.520
You know, how does that work?

45:41.520 --> 45:45.040
And you can't see that by drilling down into single cells.

45:45.040 --> 45:48.640
You have to come back out with that information

45:48.640 --> 45:53.000
and build these collective kinds of models.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.560
And the other nice thing about these models

45:54.560 --> 45:56.520
is that they are the perfect fodder

45:56.520 --> 45:59.040
for machine learning approaches

45:59.040 --> 46:02.360
to do two things, to infer better models from data.

46:02.360 --> 46:05.480
Okay, and we've done some of that.

46:05.480 --> 46:09.400
And also then to interrogate those models for interventions.

46:09.400 --> 46:13.200
And so here's some software that anyone can play with

46:13.200 --> 46:16.240
if you want to download and kind of simulate all this.

46:16.240 --> 46:18.840
And we've shown that you can actually use machine learning

46:18.840 --> 46:21.120
to find models that are really good

46:21.120 --> 46:23.560
at explaining functional data sets.

46:23.560 --> 46:25.640
In other words, you know, you did something to the system

46:25.640 --> 46:27.760
and then something else happened.

46:27.760 --> 46:29.480
What is a model explains that?

46:29.480 --> 46:32.480
And then find these kind of needle in a haystack interventions

46:32.480 --> 46:35.280
that are ways in which you could perturb it

46:35.280 --> 46:36.560
to get it to do what you want.

46:36.560 --> 46:39.760
Okay, so that I think is the kind of the future

46:39.760 --> 46:41.840
of using this for regenerative medicine.

46:41.840 --> 46:45.560
So let's talk specifically about a couple of applications

46:45.560 --> 46:47.280
in the last few minutes.

46:48.680 --> 46:51.920
The first thing is again, the cancer issue.

46:51.920 --> 46:55.880
So I've shown you that you can track the

46:57.800 --> 47:02.400
shrinking of these kinds of computational boundaries

47:02.400 --> 47:05.840
from data for the organ or whole body scale to single cells.

47:05.840 --> 47:09.400
And you can use this as an obvious application here

47:09.400 --> 47:12.800
as a kind of diagnostic modality, right?

47:12.800 --> 47:14.640
It's screening for cancer and so on.

47:14.640 --> 47:18.320
But functionally, what's really important is that first of all,

47:18.320 --> 47:23.320
you can induce basically a conversion of normal melanocytes.

47:24.080 --> 47:26.200
So here they are, these little black dots

47:26.200 --> 47:28.520
are pigment cells, they're melanocytes.

47:28.520 --> 47:31.320
If you depolarize a very specific cell population

47:31.320 --> 47:33.360
in the animal, not the melanocytes themselves,

47:33.360 --> 47:34.960
but a different cell population,

47:34.960 --> 47:37.360
we call them instructor cells for an obvious reason.

47:37.360 --> 47:39.880
They, those cells tell the melanocytes what to do,

47:39.880 --> 47:44.080
in particular to stay nice cooperative melanocytes

47:44.080 --> 47:47.320
under control, if you block their ability to signal,

47:47.320 --> 47:49.880
what happens is basically metastatic melanoma.

47:49.880 --> 47:53.000
These normal melanocytes convert to these crazy

47:53.960 --> 47:57.760
really, really kind of a long stringy things

47:57.760 --> 47:59.640
that start to crawl away.

47:59.640 --> 48:02.160
They dig into the brain, they dig into the neural tube,

48:02.160 --> 48:04.920
they start to invade.

48:04.920 --> 48:06.920
Here they are all through the blood vessels.

48:06.920 --> 48:10.560
This is basically exactly like a melanoma type of behavior.

48:10.560 --> 48:12.600
And you can see here, these blue cells,

48:12.600 --> 48:14.760
these are the ones that we actually depolarized.

48:14.760 --> 48:16.160
They are the ones that are now failing

48:16.160 --> 48:18.800
to keep the normal melanocytes behaving correctly.

48:18.800 --> 48:20.440
And the melanocytes are just at this point,

48:20.440 --> 48:22.600
they're going on their own.

48:22.600 --> 48:25.520
So it's a voltage change in the environment.

48:25.520 --> 48:27.640
There's nothing genetically wrong with these animals.

48:27.640 --> 48:28.480
There are no oncogenes.

48:28.480 --> 48:33.240
There were no carcinogens, nothing like that.

48:34.120 --> 48:37.760
But this voltage change is a physiological switch

48:37.760 --> 48:41.240
away from the cooperation of cells toward embryogenesis

48:41.240 --> 48:44.520
and towards single cell behavior.

48:44.520 --> 48:46.960
Now, what's cool is that you can override this.

48:46.960 --> 48:49.680
So if we inject an oncogene and they make these tumors,

48:49.680 --> 48:52.280
of course they're labeled with the red fluorescent protein,

48:52.280 --> 48:54.320
what you can do is co-inject the channel

48:54.320 --> 48:55.720
and you can force these cells

48:55.720 --> 48:57.640
to stay electrically coupled to their neighbors,

48:57.640 --> 48:59.960
despite what the oncogene is trying to get them to do.

48:59.960 --> 49:03.760
And here, while that dominant negative KRAS P53,

49:03.760 --> 49:06.800
whatever, while they're blazingly expressed,

49:06.800 --> 49:08.320
there's no tumor, it's the same animal.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.720
There's no tumor because these cells

49:10.720 --> 49:12.920
are coupled to this electrical network

49:12.920 --> 49:17.840
that forces them towards a proper tissue fate.

49:17.840 --> 49:21.840
So that's where our sort of cancer applications are going,

49:22.800 --> 49:25.080
and we've done this with light, with optogenetics and so on.

49:25.080 --> 49:29.800
And now we're in human cells to try to use this

49:29.800 --> 49:33.760
to target carcinogenic behavior in human cells.

49:33.760 --> 49:36.240
The other thing that is important is, again,

49:36.240 --> 49:38.280
to think about the level of control

49:38.280 --> 49:39.480
that's possible with this.

49:40.600 --> 49:42.720
Here is a normal tadpole brain.

49:42.720 --> 49:45.200
So you see forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain.

49:45.200 --> 49:48.960
And what you can do is if you, for example,

49:48.960 --> 49:51.080
introduce a mutated notch protein.

49:51.080 --> 49:53.400
So notch is a very important neurogenesis gene.

49:53.400 --> 49:56.120
You can mutate it and introduce a dominant mutation.

49:56.120 --> 49:58.320
You can see forebrain is basically gone,

49:58.320 --> 50:00.400
midbrain and hindbrain and just a bubble.

50:00.400 --> 50:03.320
These animals have no behavior to speak of.

50:03.320 --> 50:06.360
They, you know, they lay there, they do nothing.

50:06.360 --> 50:08.520
You can do the same thing with alcohol, nicotine,

50:08.520 --> 50:10.440
various teratogen exposures.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.840
What you can do is build a computational model.

50:12.840 --> 50:15.960
And again, this is the work of Alexis Paytak,

50:15.960 --> 50:18.560
Pay, who's a staff scientist in my group

50:18.560 --> 50:21.000
and a few collaborators.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.640
What you can do is you can build a computational model

50:23.640 --> 50:25.040
that asks a simple question.

50:25.040 --> 50:28.080
What determines the shape and size of the brain?

50:28.080 --> 50:30.040
And there's a particular bioelectrical pattern

50:30.040 --> 50:31.840
that's required for the brain.

50:31.840 --> 50:34.720
And then on these backgrounds of teratogens

50:34.720 --> 50:38.040
or even notch mutation, you can ask the model a question.

50:38.040 --> 50:41.040
You can say, if this pattern is disturbed,

50:41.040 --> 50:44.040
such as it is here, what channels would I have to open

50:44.040 --> 50:47.440
or close to get back to the correct pattern?

50:47.440 --> 50:49.480
And the model told us and it said,

50:49.480 --> 50:51.440
there's a particular channel HCN2,

50:51.440 --> 50:53.640
which can help us sharpen these boundaries,

50:53.640 --> 50:56.640
even though there are massive defects in the notch signaling

50:56.640 --> 50:59.480
and, you know, with these various other pathways,

50:59.480 --> 51:02.800
you can still reinforce these boundaries by opening HCN2.

51:02.800 --> 51:05.280
And sure enough, if you do it with drugs,

51:05.280 --> 51:08.440
or if you do, or if you just mis-express HCN2,

51:08.440 --> 51:11.640
you can get back to a normal brain shape,

51:11.640 --> 51:14.400
a normal brain gene expression, and in fact, normal IQ.

51:14.400 --> 51:15.920
These animals get their behaviors back

51:15.920 --> 51:17.920
and their learning rates back.

51:17.920 --> 51:19.400
So here's what this is.

51:19.400 --> 51:22.800
This is using a very specific computational model

51:22.800 --> 51:27.360
to rationally manipulate the electrical signaling

51:27.360 --> 51:31.480
to get back to a very complex organ morphogenesis.

51:31.480 --> 51:35.360
And so the whole sort of roadmap

51:35.360 --> 51:36.720
looks a little bit like this.

51:36.720 --> 51:40.640
If we already have expression data, profiling data,

51:40.640 --> 51:43.600
on which tissues in the body express which channels,

51:43.600 --> 51:44.840
so that's already known.

51:44.840 --> 51:47.080
This needs a lot more work,

51:47.080 --> 51:49.400
which is if you knew what the voltage pattern

51:49.400 --> 51:51.360
was supposed to be in various healthy tissues

51:51.360 --> 51:52.600
under various conditions,

51:52.600 --> 51:55.280
so basically physiomic profiling is needed.

51:55.280 --> 52:00.280
Then we have this computational simulation engine,

52:00.920 --> 52:04.520
which is able to say if you want to go

52:04.520 --> 52:07.320
from the incorrect pattern to the correct pattern,

52:07.320 --> 52:09.800
which of these channels would you have to open and close?

52:09.800 --> 52:11.560
Okay, and that tells you immediately

52:11.560 --> 52:16.120
what cocktail of ion channel drugs you would need to use.

52:16.120 --> 52:20.000
And so we've developed this pipeline.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.720
You can, again, you can play with it here

52:22.720 --> 52:25.600
and choose your tissue and so on.

52:25.600 --> 52:29.000
And the idea is that something like 20% of all drugs

52:29.000 --> 52:30.440
are ion channel drugs.

52:30.440 --> 52:33.720
And these things form an incredibly convenient toolkit

52:33.720 --> 52:35.680
of what we call them electroseuticals,

52:35.680 --> 52:39.240
because if you have the right computational model,

52:39.240 --> 52:40.840
you can repurpose these,

52:40.840 --> 52:44.760
which and the human safety data is done on these things.

52:44.800 --> 52:47.640
People already take them for all kinds of uses

52:47.640 --> 52:49.600
and they have a massive applicability

52:49.600 --> 52:52.440
in tweaking the bioelectrical signals.

52:52.440 --> 52:55.080
Now, another nice thing about this kind of approach

52:55.080 --> 52:58.760
is that once the bioelectric circuit has made its decision,

52:58.760 --> 53:01.320
the downstream steps that are in second messengers,

53:01.320 --> 53:03.240
then gene expression, everything else,

53:03.240 --> 53:04.560
you can be as long as you want.

53:04.560 --> 53:06.840
So for example, in the case of the frog,

53:06.840 --> 53:10.920
a one day 24 hour application of a particular cocktail

53:10.920 --> 53:14.560
gives you 13 months of leg growth, right?

53:14.560 --> 53:19.160
And you don't have to micromanage that whole process.

53:19.160 --> 53:22.000
It's just figuring out what electrical state

53:22.000 --> 53:25.440
is gonna shift the tissue towards a particular goal state

53:25.440 --> 53:27.640
that all of the cells are going to work towards.

53:27.640 --> 53:31.360
So I'm just gonna close here and summarize as follows.

53:31.360 --> 53:33.200
There's this really important layer

53:33.200 --> 53:35.320
of physiological decision-making

53:35.320 --> 53:37.880
that sits between the genotype and the anatomy.

53:37.880 --> 53:40.840
And it's becoming a really tractable target for biomedicine

53:40.840 --> 53:42.800
and also synthetic bioengineering,

53:42.800 --> 53:46.880
because we can now see how the electrical dynamics

53:46.880 --> 53:49.680
that are operating in that tissue encode

53:49.680 --> 53:52.040
particular anatomical layouts

53:52.040 --> 53:54.640
towards which the cells continue to build.

53:54.640 --> 53:57.120
And evolution apparently discovered very early on

53:57.120 --> 54:00.440
that this electrical signaling is a really convenient medium

54:00.440 --> 54:02.560
for computation and global decision-making.

54:02.560 --> 54:05.960
It's not an accident that all nervous systems use it

54:05.960 --> 54:08.760
and all of our computer technology uses it.

54:09.600 --> 54:13.960
Ion channels, especially the voltage-gated ion channels

54:13.960 --> 54:16.400
are basically voltage-gated current conductances.

54:16.400 --> 54:17.840
They're transistors, right?

54:17.840 --> 54:20.600
And that's a very powerful architecture

54:20.600 --> 54:22.600
that evolution found long before we did

54:22.600 --> 54:25.840
for forming feedback loops, memory circuits, and so on.

54:25.840 --> 54:28.960
And we think that cracking this bioelectric code

54:28.960 --> 54:30.920
can help reveal how cell networks

54:30.920 --> 54:33.200
make decisions in large-scale anatomy,

54:33.200 --> 54:35.920
not just how individual cells decide

54:35.920 --> 54:37.320
what type of cell they're going to be,

54:37.320 --> 54:41.040
but actually the real question of growth and form,

54:41.040 --> 54:44.200
where do these complex patterns reside?

54:44.200 --> 54:46.120
And we can now rewrite some of these patterns,

54:46.120 --> 54:50.360
such as, for example, in the planarian or in the frog.

54:50.360 --> 54:53.360
And new machine learning tools are coming online

54:53.360 --> 54:55.280
to help us design strategies

54:55.280 --> 54:58.440
for all kinds of applications.

54:58.440 --> 55:01.680
So I would like to thank the people in my group

55:01.680 --> 55:02.760
who did the work.

55:02.760 --> 55:05.280
These are all the postdocs and students.

55:06.240 --> 55:09.880
And others who did the work that I showed you today.

55:09.880 --> 55:12.560
Here are some of our collaborators

55:12.560 --> 55:13.840
who are working with us.

55:13.840 --> 55:15.640
Of course, the model systems that we work with,

55:15.640 --> 55:17.440
all kinds of animals.

55:17.440 --> 55:20.960
And our funders, very grateful to them.

55:20.960 --> 55:23.360
Again, Disclosure, Morphosuticals Inc.

55:23.360 --> 55:26.240
is the company for our frog limb regeneration work.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.640
And just in the end,

55:27.640 --> 55:31.080
I always like to show a video of these two-headed animals.

55:31.080 --> 55:33.440
The first time I reported these data at a meeting,

55:33.440 --> 55:34.400
someone stood up and said,

55:34.440 --> 55:36.400
that's impossible, those animals can't exist.

55:36.400 --> 55:39.120
And so now I make sure that I bring a video.
