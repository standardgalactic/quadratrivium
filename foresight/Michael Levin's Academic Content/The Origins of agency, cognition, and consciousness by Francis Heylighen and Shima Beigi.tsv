0	9600	I already told Michael this is a little bit improvised. I was supposed to give this last
9600	16400	week but then I was also I could be paid and in the meantime I have done a bit of hope but
16400	22320	still not as much as I would have liked to do but I think it will be interesting.
22320	28240	So what I'm trying to do here is for the first time to do a research but
28240	36160	I've been busy with one on the origin of goldite, one on the origin of human consciousness.
40160	49760	So what the two projects have in common is that they're both about agency which is a topic I think
49760	57040	that in your lawyer you also have been thinking about. So agency first of all means it's gold
58000	66800	that are moving to the goal in order that they need to be able to mess up the conditions in
66800	74880	which they should be able to make the right actions. That is the main theme but then I want to go to
74880	82240	a higher level of agency the human consciousness where you're not only acting reflexively but
82240	88320	you are able to choose between different different causes of action and that will allow me to put a
88320	95120	first attempt tackling the psychological heart problem of consciousness. So that's briefly what
95120	101920	I want to go out on. So let's start the first part which is about a goal directedness or
101920	110240	actually about a life. So all living systems are there because they have survived natural selection
110240	115440	means they have been selected to be fit and to be fit that means that they should be able to
115440	123520	survive and go. If they are not capable to achieve that goal of surviving and going well they simply
123520	131040	simply are elated. So we can assume all living systems have this imbalal of survival and survival
132000	140080	survival they can maintain their metabolism is of perturbed patients because the world is not
140720	149760	always the same. So this I will summarize as agency living systems have the implicit role of
149760	156560	wanting to survive and to maintain themselves in order to do that they need to that means they need
156560	163600	to be able to support opportunities of surpassing perturbed patients and in order to act they need
163600	170880	to have some kind of implicit cognition namely they need to know what action is appropriate for
170880	177600	what perturbed patients. So that's the basic framework let's now go into more detail about
177600	187920	how that could have evolved. So the best definition of living systems that I know is the
187920	197120	famous one of Maturana eila autopoiesis. Autopoiesis means the existing is self-proloding it forms
197760	206960	it's a network of processes that reconstitutes all and Maturana and Varela automatically
206960	213680	connect this notion of cognition to their notion of autopoiesis because each system should be able
213680	220640	to produce itself it should also be able to withstand any perturbations that may push it to
220640	227520	want the self-maintenance so it needs to have this cognition. The theory of autopoiesis Maturana eila
228000	239840	is I would say very difficult abstract sometimes confusing so I have tried to make a simpler
239840	252000	version of it that is a version where that is based on a network of processes where processes
252000	262480	then can be defined formally. Autopoietic system network of processes is something that some input
263600	272480	transforms that input into some output so it produces new components it consumes other components
272480	278720	or it transforms certain components into other components and then the definition of autopoiesis
279040	285520	is that the components being produced by these processes are such that they never generate the
285520	293440	same processes that started them so they very simply put the processes on the poetic system
293440	301360	system produce components while the components produce the person the whole thing is self-generating
301360	312800	self-producing. So to make that clear I start from what I call a process on poetry that means
312800	321360	I do not at assume that universe is constituted of objects where objects are inert materials
322400	328480	which ultimately people tend to tend to see as particles. I see the universe consisting out of
328960	337280	process and a process is something that we can describe formally as action a reaction meaning
337280	345040	you have some input things some they react with each other and you get an output and then a system
345040	351920	such as an poetic system then becomes appellate network of processes so instead of start on
352000	360240	stable elements of I assume it's stability is the result of process that somehow some are debiliters
367920	374800	so what are reactions a reaction is kind of like the minimal element of my apology
375760	382480	a reaction assumes that there are conditions which are distinguishable states of it's over there
382480	388960	condition can be the presence of particular molecule of part of biological species but also
388960	396720	be something much much more a social condition of worlds or over this anything that can be
396720	404080	distinguished from its absence is a condition and then processes represented by arrows could be
404080	412560	for example that a distinguishable condition appears a is formed and this variable condition
412560	419360	disappears a condition is transformed into a different condition and some some combinations
419360	428720	decisions react react to form a combination of conditions so this is very similar to the world
428720	435040	to the one you think they are in element elementary partition but the ABCDs that are right here they
435040	443600	can be any distinguishable conditions so it wasn't an elementary a poetic system it's a system that
443600	450160	produce itself but of course it must be term thermodynamically open that means it must have
450160	456800	input from outside and there will be some some dissipation with some waste so in this case I
456800	463200	need to have need to have some in a of a some outlay of b and then a and a and being themselves
463200	470480	now that's of course much too simple to have a living system so let's look at it and somewhat
470480	477520	more complicated example complicated example in the sense that I have still an input I still have
477520	483440	still still have an input in between I have a net of reaction that's that's much more complicated
483440	490720	but that but that is such that every everything every every component we condition the the base
490720	499120	the cities there is always always some produces it but in appears in disappears nothing nothing
499120	504720	enough nothing everything is produced by some reaction and the whole reaction thing is keeping
504720	511440	itself going so so uh for those who are interested describe a mathematical model
511440	516640	all the chemical organization is something called chemical chemical organizing theory in which
516640	524800	which you can at the conditions and a network of reactions becomes also auto poetic meaning
524800	531360	meaning self meaning and closed closed that whatever is consumed is produced whatever is produced is
531360	541200	consumed so now uh where does auto is come from that's kind of the assumption of my ontology
541200	547840	that is that process self of organize into more more complicated organizations since
547840	554720	so how I have that that in the simplest I start with a random reaction sections random content
554720	561040	means any any a plus b c plus d's we have we have payments with that we have just generated
561040	566480	random that random network sign then we have seen what's seen what happens is typically
566480	574160	that itself organizes into the kind of auto poetic how does that happen to start with
574880	580000	number of components that are available components of our conditions have the reactions
580800	586560	the reactors form the components into components which come themselves out as something something
586560	593200	the new components are on when you see you start with a number of components components you produce
593920	598800	you add you add the new one up to the point that you point that you can alone do once because
598800	605040	there is no material available to available to add anything there yet on the other hand some of
605040	610400	the some of the kind of consumed but they are not produced or not produced enough to keep the whole
610400	617360	thing going so you remove them in the end what are you left with with components that are being
617360	625280	produced that are being consumed but such that that they are they are being consumed and consumed
625280	632640	at the same time so this is a follow-up that I'm going to schedule quickly for this institute you
632640	639360	can look at look at my papers the chemical organization the apoyosis is what is that a
639360	645760	self-maintenance of reactors is an attractor of the dynamics that means that if you let the dynamics
645760	652640	hold on its own eventually you will get something that resembles an autopoietic system or in most
652640	659760	cases that the apopoietic system will trivial but in principle you can generate an apoyotic system
659760	668960	like that to self-organization now what one thing to get to is that the apopoietic system should
668960	676240	not maintain itself in real circumstances that mean ideal circumstances where all the input
677280	686000	components are not there but in the presence of an environment where things are not always
686000	692480	available sometimes there are conditions that are interfering with your reactions sometimes the
692480	701840	conditions you need for your reactions are not there so I've said that the apoyotic regime is
701840	707200	an attractor but there will be the patients that will be pushing the system out of its
707200	714000	attractor so if we think about the apopoietic system as a kind of a very primitive organism that
714000	721040	organ lacks food so even at the moment there's not enough impotence it will die on the other
721040	729280	hands it it may die because of toxin that means components that interfere with the reactions
729280	740560	that are necessary to the whole thing align so first stage is the system of organisms into
740560	746480	something self-maintaining second age that self-maintaining system being thrown around by
746480	755200	perturbants most most of them are killed by perturbations but eventually we may assume
755200	763120	evolution will lead to another system that's resilient resilient that means that it is able
763120	769360	to bounce back from these perturbations that there are all kinds of changes happening in the
769360	775520	environment it can somehow compensate for these perturbations that means for example
776560	783360	some some components of you that's previously worked as toxins that means they are perturbing
783360	791280	the metabolism your version apopoietic system the more resilient and will have some way to
791280	799440	neutralize these toxins since if for example the food is not available maybe it will have developed
799440	807920	some internal reactions to digest a different type of food so i'm assuming that if the process of
807920	813360	evolution goes on long enough the system will become more and more and more resilient we have
813360	819600	done a number of simulations with these networks and indeed you see that if you give it enough time
819600	824480	the time it tends to become more resilient so so what does it mean resilient in terms of
824480	833600	dynamic systems it means that the auto system is an attracter it's basic basic of attack means
833600	841920	all all the options that lead to the attracter become exciting will become wider it will have
841920	851200	a wider range of viability so let's imagine this the dark green that you see is the attracter that
851200	859440	means that is the autopoietic regime which the system tries to turn the light is the base that
859440	866720	means all of the different regulations from which the autopoietic system can back to its
866720	876080	its regime of sitenance a partition then means means any unregulated change that makes the system
876080	883360	move from one position to another as long as the perturbations remain inside the basin they
883360	889760	will automatically be compensated because as long as the system is in the basin it will on its own
889760	896880	go to the reactor if on the other hand perturbation can push the system outside of the basin then it
896880	902640	will no longer go with the attracter which means that basically the autopoietic system
902640	908800	longer autopoietic that cannot maintain itself what could potentially potentially happen is
908800	914960	also a different attracter attracter potentially could be could be even better let's not discuss that here
919040	927200	so that allows me now to define directness as resilient autopoiesis
928160	935120	autopoiesis is the attracter as autopoiesis this means if you perturb it from the attracter if
935120	944160	you put it out of the attracter it will come back it has a one basin and basin is is a growing
944160	953760	process of self-made so it's not an equilibrium like a thermo system versus thermo thermodynamic
953840	960080	equilibrium that is not a living system a living system is a process that is actively
960080	968240	self-maintaining that is consuming and producing so operation what does that mean a goal-directed
968240	974720	system if it's not in goal it will move towards the goal if it's in the goal it will stay in goal
976080	980880	if it perturbed it means if it's pushed off its goal it will it will perform
980880	988000	action that requires energy so as so as to return to that so that we might kind of a
988000	994960	minimal thing of goldness in living living systems a basic basic form of aid
996320	1004720	now we come to the issue of cognition so goal-directed activity we can say requires
1004720	1011600	a minimal form of cognition because it needs to be able to compensate the deviations from the rule
1012640	1021520	so if we look from the inside autopoietic system it undergoes a deviation it should it should somehow
1021520	1026480	do something that there is that there is a deviation that that means it needs some ability
1026480	1032320	ability of person of something thing and it should also have an ability to perform an action that
1032320	1040480	means one of its repertoire of reactions should switch on so as to neutralize the deviation
1041600	1049760	and implicit in this whole dynamic is the notion of knowledge namely action that still gets
1049760	1054640	by the sun's condition should be appropriate for that to that condition so the sun should
1054640	1062960	somehow know which action to perform for which condition and that now model model with additional
1064160	1074640	format is used in AI action rules so function rules you have an agent the agent has a number of
1074640	1079680	condition action rules that means it recognizes a certain condition for example it
1080640	1089200	senses that is condition X and it knows if I'm in condition X then I should perform action Y
1090160	1097920	and we can help with that simply as a process X to Y that process in one of the processes inside
1097920	1102800	this complex network processes that in a poetic system system
1102960	1110640	now cognition are lots of definitions of cognition and we need to be
1110640	1117280	to be careful about what we mean by cognition so one of the more interesting results from
1117280	1126000	cyber ethics is so-called the law of regulatory models proposed by Conant and Ashby and it says
1126800	1132720	if you want to have a directed system standard girl direct system must include some mapping
1132720	1139680	which they call a model namely it should map all the potential deviation perturbations
1140240	1148000	the right action that means for deviation there should one specific action that mapping exists
1148000	1158000	then the system is able to control to reach girl and that's model we might say implement the
1158000	1164800	systems like now model is a common term when thinking about evolution the system has a model
1164800	1170880	of its environment but that is not the way the way that Maturana Varela interpreted
1170880	1179600	Ryan and Varela and size it what Conant and Ashby call it is not a representation of the
1179600	1186880	environment what they say is the is the audit system is autonomous it functions functions
1187440	1195120	it does not know what is going on in the external world the only thing that we can know is
1196720	1204640	the deviations its senses it has a metabolism it has a network processes when one of its processes
1205440	1212720	is functioning the way it should be the whole whole poetic system is perturbances that
1212960	1220640	there is something wrong but it does not know what lost the deviation so Maturana Varela
1220640	1229520	emphasized that this kind of knowledge is subjective the auto poetic system knows only
1229520	1237360	the things that affect its own auto poetic auto poetic it does not represent the environment
1237360	1246400	in some objective way so now we become to the further evolution so we only have a system that
1246400	1255920	is almost that is girl like that has some level of cognitive but but he can think this cognition
1255920	1263600	mission should accept the system be able to adapt adapt these conditions and and lots of
1264560	1271040	if there is a lot of variation in the environment the conditions will change so that means the
1271040	1277520	system should be able to sense emotions should be able to interpret the conditions it should be
1277520	1284080	able to make sense of the conditions that its senses so it requires that it has some elementary
1284160	1290160	awareness not not really of what objectively going on in the environment but
1292320	1299840	in what in what way are changing in the environment so that it affects itself so
1299840	1310000	so we let let evolution its role the system will need to become more aware more and more and more
1310080	1318160	in so that it can recognize a wider range of of conditions and can interpret them and perform
1318160	1327360	the right types of actions so so now this is a scheme that you probably seen which I borrow from
1327760	1341600	Michael he called the cognitive viability I have only the cone of OS so if an agent that is
1341600	1349840	situated somewhere in the middle of that of that cone agent will to some extent be aware of
1350720	1357840	what is going on in its environment from this purely specific point of view but still it will
1357840	1368160	to some degree be aware of conditions in the past in the future in the neighborhood so the cone
1368160	1375280	kind of kind of represents the range of awareness the kind of kind of range of the system the
1375280	1384640	potential makes sense the more advanced the system the wider the cone so here is another picture
1384640	1392640	that I took from Michael here are some examples of cones a very small creature like a pig will have
1392640	1400320	a very small cone a human can have a very big cone and a dog can have something in between
1400320	1409200	but now I come I make a very very big jump I started by it by explaining how the boy has
1409200	1418480	this this which is the organization of a single like a big theorem and now I'm making a jump
1418480	1430320	in human consciousness so let's forget about all the stages model the cellularity animals
1430880	1436880	nervous systems etc but what is the essence of the different between the cognition of a
1436880	1445360	vacuum and the cognition of human or in bacteria the way I use the con the the cognition is
1445360	1451280	deterministic the the being sense is a part is a particular con performs a part of a particular
1452480	1459360	always the same condition leads to same action now we're speaking about higher organisms organisms
1459360	1466640	and we humans are there but probably others probably apes talking sense other mammals and
1466640	1474880	maybe both are also there but there is an intermediate decision making stage that means
1474880	1482400	there is a condition that the organism senses and then there is a state here I have called reflection
1483040	1492800	of considering different of all ways of reacting to that condition condition means that the action
1492880	1501280	follows so a part of reflection action and actually there is no action I I make some of
1501280	1507760	the conditionation in women I can decide I need to act in this way or I can decide there is no
1507760	1517360	action words taking so this is what's called free will we humans have the ability to consider
1517360	1524320	many different forces and to choose one of them and that is typically what we will
1524320	1529840	will call conscious ability of considering different possibilities
1531680	1540880	now define it's easiest to distinguish conscious or subconsciousness so we humans
1540880	1549680	still have the same level of subconscious reactions like bacteria and like simple organism we have
1549680	1558480	this kind of automatic involuntary reflex for example if I put my hand on a hot so I will
1558480	1567520	pull it away immediately I don't need to think about what this is hot if my hand on it on it
1567520	1572800	then it will burn therefore I should pull it pull away my I will just pull away my way my
1572800	1581440	and I may not feel the heat of the of the stuff so that process implemented in the brain it's
1582880	1588960	modeled as what is not a speed forward process it's a process that goes straight from
1589680	1597840	sense condition to action they stay immediate way there are no details now what's the difference
1597840	1605200	with with the conscious process a conscious process is a process that we can monitor we can in
1605200	1613040	our mind minds we know what we are thinking we can I mean our thoughts also redirect our
1613360	1621040	for example I may distract this and tell myself no you should be busy with that you should be
1621040	1628560	doing that so conscious processes are processes I define as processes in the mind that can be
1628560	1635600	monitored that can be examined and that can be redirected of all the different different
1635600	1640560	many different theories of consciousness though that I like the most the one that I think
1641280	1647120	explained this is also was was complete is so-called global neural space theory
1647120	1656240	theory and the most active active research is stony stony slas and what the global
1656240	1666480	neural workspace analysis is that it is some kind of a special network the workspace which
1666480	1673360	functions a bit like a kind of a forum or a meeting space where lots of different
1673360	1683120	process is coming from and part of the building come together and the process in that workspace
1683120	1693760	they are all what all circulate the other term other people people call it really
1694080	1701200	or recurrence resonance but the main idea is it's a process a forward process that means
1701200	1709360	a process that goes in one direction it's a process that that cycles around and what is the
1709360	1717760	reason for the cycling problem with activation of neurons in the brain is that activation
1717760	1724720	passed on new neurons do remain activated so you want to keep some keep some new working memory
1725760	1732240	you need to recreate the activation and you can and you can only by having the active activation
1732240	1740320	come back to the space and then that's for me now the essence of what creates the consciousness
1740320	1749040	by keeping this total of this perception active in your memory you can inspect this
1750000	1755760	and if you can inspect it that means other parts of the brain can look at this other
1755760	1762160	other part of the brain intervening and is now what will create a free so I will
1762800	1772080	it's best explained with owing so this is the scheme for the conscious processing the feet forward
1772080	1781040	propagation so what you have is just a line the sensors some some condition there are a number
1781040	1788080	of immediate new neural modules that process information for example if I see something
1788080	1795600	there are different layers in my visual cortex that will first recognize light and dark and then
1795600	1803760	recognize edges and then they will recognize shapes and then they recognize objects it leads
1803760	1813920	a particular conclusion in the example I gave the of the hand on a hot stove
1814000	1822240	here probably it may not even reach the brain it may just go to the spinal cord but
1822880	1831200	the sensors send a signal that that eventually be pulled away by hands it just a fourth process
1835760	1843120	so now of course processing that is what I call all circuiting active activation we have the
1843120	1851840	sensors here on the bottom left left the sun provide input input the effect effectors my muscles
1852640	1861120	are put on the system but before it reaches the effectors the activation circulates in what
1861120	1869040	called the global workspace which is some kind of a a suit to be a network of on-range connections
1869040	1877680	in the cortex and then you have the diff modules which are specialized circuits that for example
1877680	1888960	recognize sounds or look openings or or make equations or or fractions the the most can be
1889760	1897840	very diverse very specialist but these models now interact with what's going on in the workspace
1897840	1904720	that means that what happens in the workspace the activation that's circulating can go to a
1905920	1913760	to one of the modules which the module doesn't do anything with it on the other hand it can go to
1913760	1920320	a module module reacts so it's an interaction action or there can be a module that receives
1920320	1926720	infusion from a different part of the brain and that some some input in our workspace space so
1926720	1934160	our workspace is seen as a kind of a form a kind of a public or all these specialized
1934160	1940960	best circuits and they're in a kind of a discussion it's as if they are talking together in this
1940960	1949280	global workspace space so here here there are some examples of from the of the where they are
1949280	1957680	doing experiments with all these and you can give them here so-called sub-subliminals that
1957680	1963840	means something that I think that a visual stimulus and disappears so quickly quickly that
1963840	1969840	the monkey doesn't have the unconscious of it of it and you see this kind of a field of field
1969840	1977840	activity that means that for the input the the the the neurons get directly activated and they pass
1978800	1985600	their output to another of neurons but it moves basically in one direction on the other hand if
1985600	1992320	you leave the stimulus for a long enough time that the monkey becomes conscious of it now that's
1992320	1999200	what they call reverberation what I call circulation now you see that the different created neurons
1999600	2004960	the sensation back and forth everything is keeping itself self-indulgent
2008640	2016640	that is a standard model of consciousness or what is called access consciousness the
2016640	2023760	consciousness in the sense that you have access to what's going on in your mind you have the ability
2024080	2031360	to examine to monitor to read whatever is going on in your mind but now there is another aspect
2031360	2037280	of consciousness that is subjective experience and associated with this with this whole
2037280	2046720	problem of consciousness what is a subjective experience it is feeling that that is something
2046720	2053600	that you are conscious and that subjective experience I personally prefer the term
2053600	2061280	subjective experience but some other terms you may have heard are qualia acqua is an individual
2061280	2069040	subjective experience it's also called phenomenal consciousness and a most common phase define what
2069040	2077760	what a qualia or a subjective subjective experience that what is it like like to for example what what
2077760	2084960	is it to see see hurt now typically typical example loss of his health healthness is subjective
2084960	2092800	experiences is something else as an input but you have the subjective experience of healthness
2093760	2101280	so the heart problem of consciousness is what precisely are these subjective experience
2101280	2108880	why do we have these subjective experiences and the famous uh thought experiment that kind of
2108880	2114640	hind the whole heart heart problem of conscious was uh discussed by the philosopher david
2114640	2121600	charmer it's the zombie thought experiment so so what he does david david charmers he thinks that
2121600	2129840	there are certain speech he calls zombies that behave just like any normal being but they don't
2129840	2140080	have subjective experience so he imagines that the zombie would put his hands on a hot stove and the
2140080	2148160	zombie would he would pull away his hands and ask the zombie what happens the the zombie will tell
2148160	2156000	i felt hot pain but actually the zombie didn't feel any so the thought experiment is that the zombie
2156000	2160080	behaves like a normal normal human being but actually he doesn't doesn't have subjective
2160080	2167120	experience and then the heart problem is since by definition we cannot cannot see between a zombie
2167120	2174720	and in a human being we cannot do a scientific experiment that we explain what the human being
2174720	2182640	has subjective experience what the zombie likes yeah to me that is a meaningless thought
2182640	2188480	experiment because if there is really no way that that i can distinguish only from a human human being
2189760	2196320	all all of you can be or none of you of you can be zombies any of you can be a zombie to me that is
2196320	2205440	not not a good way to good way to define it so let's explain something subjective explain
2205440	2212800	my point the point of view first question a question that philosophers to my surprise
2212800	2221840	have a lot of difficulties with why is experience subjective why i can't be just objectively see
2221840	2228480	the way things things are so so for me it appears humans are autoplay systems
2229120	2236880	autoplay systems as i said in me cannot objectively believe the world they do have access
2236880	2245920	to opt out in the in the world they only have access to her perterops their self-maintaining
2245920	2252160	processes whatever interferes with their metabolism if something interferes with my
2252160	2257280	metabolism that means for for example that it leads to the releases of newer transmitters
2257280	2267360	if in particle cells then i can feel that perturbation of my metabolism but but i do not access
2268160	2270000	to think itself though
2272640	2279520	the thing that follows so much from my theory of poyesis is is that autopoietic processes by
2279520	2287920	definition they are not neutral they care about what happens to them they distinguish between
2287920	2295200	good things and bad things whatever helps them to maintain themselves such as food
2295840	2303280	they see as positive whatever interferes with the autopoietic such as a plate that can burn them
2303280	2311280	they will see as negative so from an autopoietic point of view all all experiments of course
2311280	2319600	happen from an internal thousand perspective i can only perceive the world from inside my own body
2319600	2328400	inside my own brain and what i i perceive as neutral is not objective it is colored by
2328400	2337440	my goals which is to stay alive and that is why for example have a different perception between
2337440	2347040	let's say a butterfly and a wasp i butterflies i don't like wasps i know that wasps can be
2347040	2355040	which will which will interfere with my autopoiesis so and biology might say you should be more you
2355040	2362640	should be objective objective butterflies wasps are just insects but i'm likely to kill the
2364080	2366320	the the wasp and not the butterfly
2366400	2369120	so now
2371120	2379200	so the subjective experience affects my autopoietic process so what does that mean
2379200	2385760	effect i'm using using effect now so in the psychology also an effect is something that
2385760	2393680	acts on all that means it pushes or pulls me pulls me towards it like for example for example it's
2393680	2399360	if there is food i will be attracted to the food on the other hand it will push me away away from
2399360	2406400	things are dangerous from disturbances it will push me away from the hot plate or from the wasp
2407680	2414080	and that is a typical old world directed system there is a classic example of bacteria
2414400	2422960	taxis bacteria can substance food molecules and toxin models and and they are to follow
2423440	2428800	a gradient towards the food or away from the toxins so that's what we
2430000	2438480	define elementary entry agency of the world directedness bacteria are affected by what
2438480	2445680	happened at one effect there but there is not that conscious effects so now i finally
2445680	2454480	turn to my solution of the heart problem of business it's what i call local field model
2454480	2462640	i've also been the local prospect model so effects are equivalent to four these things that push push
2462640	2471840	or pull on the other hand godness tells me that i don't just just immediately react react take the
2471840	2478240	time to come to consider our different different process that push and pull in different direction
2478240	2487760	so there is a range of potential actions now a range is something like a space if i put a force
2487760	2494640	across a range i get what in mathematics or in physics called a field i could have presented
2494640	2502320	as a kind of a vector field across a space of potential potentiality that means potential
2502320	2510320	reactions i i would have but but this i do not do not know what one under all circumstances
2510320	2516720	there is this cognitive the field the field is flow emanates from the here the here now
2517360	2528880	and the farther away in space of time the less my my idea will be what what the field is
2530800	2539120	so how how can we even this local field in the brain i go back to my to my picture of the
2539120	2544800	workspace there is a circling activation so in the global space there is this this
2544800	2551920	phase activation but the activation to some the greeks it's a process process spreading
2551920	2560240	activation in uh in psychomes i think that are are asserts that are related to that are in the
2560240	2567280	global workspace will receive some leaking activation and that leaking activation in a
2567280	2574560	sense pairs the way for potentially the next action or the next total or the next interpretation
2575360	2583440	so the diffusing activation diffusing from the global workspace that's a sense forms
2583440	2590160	the local the local post which to to be is the subjective experience
2591120	2594080	uh we'll skip that that one
2596080	2604240	so this local field it's a conceptual model the reason that nowadays i prefer to call it local
2604240	2609440	prospect is that that's the first time i started explaining it to people working consciousness
2610160	2616800	everybody i assumed that i was imagining some some kind of a mechanical field
2616880	2624160	emanating from my my brain and the field is purely a mathematical concept or a
2624160	2629440	conceptual model it's not a physical physical field on the other hand on the other hand i'm using
2629440	2634720	field because because field is something you can explain matter in matter so that means that
2634720	2641600	potentially i hope that they will eventually be able to make a mathematical model or computer
2641600	2645520	model of what the subjective experience would be
2648480	2655600	so in consciousness we speak about about so-called neural correlates of core consciousness
2656160	2662640	the subjective experience that you feel the neural correlates the activity that is actually
2662640	2670320	not noticeable in the brain and this neural correlate format for me it's a term that i took
2670320	2679600	from uh the neural uh uh that was steven goes i call it an adaptive resonance resonance because
2679600	2686800	it is kind of self-maintaining circulation of activity adaptive because it constantly adapts
2686800	2694000	to things to inputs and outputs so there's activation that is kind of self-maintaining
2694000	2701280	within work memory in the global global workspace that activation in and out of out of the resonance
2701280	2708960	like that it moved one direction action all year and initially the activation again can
2708960	2716800	do the different actions and then and then it assists it choose the action rather than
2716800	2722400	the other potential it's a little bit available to the collapse of the wave function in quantum
2722480	2729120	mechanics if your field of activation is diffusing can be seen as a wave then at a certain moment
2729120	2735680	when you make a decision to do this or that it's like like the wave of it but then immediately
2735680	2748640	when it starts spreading again so five free willful uh i see brain as a elective specialized
2748640	2756000	modules these as modules or circuits we can see them as kind of agents within the society of mind
2756800	2764640	these agents interact they have a discussion the discussion takes place in these global
2764640	2773200	workspaces and why is the world free because you can say beforehand what the art of discussion
2773200	2780080	will be it's as if you different different people with different unions and different different
2780080	2788400	backgrounds ever to get about whatever whatever political problem you do not know beforehand
2788400	2793760	what solution they will come out on art because they are they are confronted with perspectives
2793760	2800640	that have not been confronted before as each speaks in turn that means there is a very strong
2800640	2808320	effect of who speaks when timing state date etc you cannot predict what discussion will be
2810160	2815520	it's a non-linear process that means that it's subject to what's called it's called the butterfly
2815520	2822080	effect meaning meaning that very differences in activation of timing can can lead to these outcomes
2822880	2829120	in other words whole process isn't predictable why we call it for it free it is not it's not
2829120	2838560	deterministic so again the same picture the society of mind now now we look at the modules
2838560	2844240	as if they are agents each agent has certain opinions certain things that are particularly
2844240	2851840	important certain things you know certain things it's good at and that's agent is is
2852480	2859520	some of its opinion in the workspace is where all the agents can react to it and their opinion
2859520	2866720	opinion to it whole thing is is evaluated in interaction different agents agency
2868400	2875760	so here i go back to the picture i i took from michael where he speaks about compound intelligence
2875920	2883920	is cells together have a higher level of intelligent cognition than individual cells
2883920	2890640	be because they interact act because they are in this kind of kind of discussion the same thing
2890640	2897280	for for organisms like arms same for you or humans at each level each level we can
2897760	2901280	cognition mission is beauty is collective if
2903280	2910000	so the the moments are different agents that become coupled that means that they are in some
2910000	2916000	relationship that's relatively stable i know that they will exchange new information because one
2916000	2922160	will react what the other one does the orbit of the one becomes becomes the input of the other
2922160	2930560	and vice versa cells travel from from agent to agent and and that allows a more this or
2930560	2940080	collective intelligent my first example was a bacterial cell apopoietic network network that
2940080	2945680	consists of actions each of the action of the action of the molecules is you might say a very
2946000	2951840	primitive that is in acting with all the others to gather they form apopoietic network
2952720	2959360	when i look at the human brain i the agents are different models that are helping putting their
2959360	2965280	discussion in the global workspace and finally in society we might say different people are
2965280	2970640	discussing in what we call the northern north sphere the worldwide crop crop the
2971600	2975440	uh gen genitals fee in which communications are
2978080	2988640	fine finally in russian what i have to do is to do a kind of a natural history of agency starting
2988640	2995760	from the very simplest agents which are the outcome of reaction networks that self-organize
2996400	3001520	these reaction networks tend to become but close and self-containing meaning that they are
3001520	3010320	autopoietic as simple apopoietic systems are uh uh they're going for the innovations they need to
3010320	3016160	learn to adapt to adapt that means they need to learn to learn to condition action action rules
3016160	3021600	you know in this in this condition i need to perform perform this action to survive fine
3022320	3027920	and in human brains we have the additional stage of consciousness that means that the
3027920	3034560	condition action rules are no longer automatic condition automatically leading to action
3034560	3042400	thus we will get an intermediate stage of of circulation where activate thoughts feelings
3042400	3049120	are serrating in what's called the global journal workspace that circulation defines
3049120	3055440	a local possible possible development months out of these these potential demands
3056480	3062080	eventually chosen and the one that is one that is is chosen collectively collaboratively
3062880	3072320	by the different models are discussing so uh i think we still have time for a few questions
3072320	3078960	great thank you um any questions
3081840	3089280	sure i'll ask a question this is chris um thanks thanks for your talk
3091600	3095680	you characterize the environment as a source of perturbations
3095920	3104960	and you also mentioned that autopoiesis is an attractor in the state space of a complex system
3105920	3110800	so do you consider the environment to be itself an autopoietic system
3113120	3122000	uh that's an interesting term uh this is part of a broader perspective which are relational
3122000	3128880	agency if if you look at an ecosystem you can see the system as a as a whole as a
3128880	3136560	poetic system in the in the sense that there are flows of uh was it being consumed consumed
3136560	3143040	and produced so an ecosystem a whole would also be an autopoietic system in that sense
3144880	3149600	okay great thank you
3152000	3154880	anyone else
3157360	3164880	um hi uh i do i do have a question um could you elaborate a little bit about uh your response
3164880	3171840	to the zombie criticism or are you are you thinking that uh a zombie autopoietic system
3171840	3181600	cannot exist uh what exactly are your thoughts there this curious okay uh uh it's it's a kind
3181600	3189040	of a metaphysical assumption uh which which light means the identity of the indistinguishables
3189680	3197200	so what's given by that is if you cannot distinguish two things if there is no no you can say
3198160	3203200	i have only here and i have a human here i can distinguish the one from the other some way
3204080	3210720	then the identity of the distinctions zombies are humans so so for me
3210720	3217600	isolating a distinction lead to any other the other distinction is meaningless yes another way
3217600	3223200	to formulate it is it's called the difference that makes it if you start by postulating a
3223200	3228880	difference between zombies and humans then it should make some other difference just postulating
3228880	3235920	a difference that does not lead to any any difference to me it's useful that it's making
3235920	3245920	things complicated that shouldn't be made complicated so the the main question really
3245920	3250880	for me is is why do we subjective experience experience why do we something for example
3251360	3259440	if we look at and and we feel because the as the color is a signal that has certain meaning
3259440	3266320	for us that we have associated for example with the warm or with action and that makes us do certain
3266320	3273760	things harder than others so the color that will influence me in a different way than the color
3273760	3282000	blue and that is what the subjective experience is yeah i the way i always understood the zombie
3282000	3288880	criticism was that subjective experiences is not necessary to do the kind of things that
3290160	3295600	organisms as complex as humans can do but we do have subjective experience which
3296560	3301840	is it may have been a product of evolution and maybe it plays a a role
