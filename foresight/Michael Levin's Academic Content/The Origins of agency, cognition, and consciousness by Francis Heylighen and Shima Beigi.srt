1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
I already told Michael this is a little bit improvised. I was supposed to give this last

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,400
week but then I was also I could be paid and in the meantime I have done a bit of hope but

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,320
still not as much as I would have liked to do but I think it will be interesting.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,240
So what I'm trying to do here is for the first time to do a research but

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:36,160
I've been busy with one on the origin of goldite, one on the origin of human consciousness.

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:49,760
So what the two projects have in common is that they're both about agency which is a topic I think

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:57,040
that in your lawyer you also have been thinking about. So agency first of all means it's gold

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,800
that are moving to the goal in order that they need to be able to mess up the conditions in

9
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:14,880
which they should be able to make the right actions. That is the main theme but then I want to go to

10
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,240
a higher level of agency the human consciousness where you're not only acting reflexively but

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,320
you are able to choose between different different causes of action and that will allow me to put a

12
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,120
first attempt tackling the psychological heart problem of consciousness. So that's briefly what

13
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,920
I want to go out on. So let's start the first part which is about a goal directedness or

14
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:50,240
actually about a life. So all living systems are there because they have survived natural selection

15
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,440
means they have been selected to be fit and to be fit that means that they should be able to

16
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:03,520
survive and go. If they are not capable to achieve that goal of surviving and going well they simply

17
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,040
simply are elated. So we can assume all living systems have this imbalal of survival and survival

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,080
survival they can maintain their metabolism is of perturbed patients because the world is not

19
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:29,760
always the same. So this I will summarize as agency living systems have the implicit role of

20
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,560
wanting to survive and to maintain themselves in order to do that they need to that means they need

21
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,600
to be able to support opportunities of surpassing perturbed patients and in order to act they need

22
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:50,880
to have some kind of implicit cognition namely they need to know what action is appropriate for

23
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:57,600
what perturbed patients. So that's the basic framework let's now go into more detail about

24
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:07,920
how that could have evolved. So the best definition of living systems that I know is the

25
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:17,120
famous one of Maturana eila autopoiesis. Autopoiesis means the existing is self-proloding it forms

26
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:26,960
it's a network of processes that reconstitutes all and Maturana and Varela automatically

27
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:33,680
connect this notion of cognition to their notion of autopoiesis because each system should be able

28
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,640
to produce itself it should also be able to withstand any perturbations that may push it to

29
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,520
want the self-maintenance so it needs to have this cognition. The theory of autopoiesis Maturana eila

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:59,840
is I would say very difficult abstract sometimes confusing so I have tried to make a simpler

31
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:12,000
version of it that is a version where that is based on a network of processes where processes

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,480
then can be defined formally. Autopoietic system network of processes is something that some input

33
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:32,480
transforms that input into some output so it produces new components it consumes other components

34
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,720
or it transforms certain components into other components and then the definition of autopoiesis

35
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,520
is that the components being produced by these processes are such that they never generate the

36
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:53,440
same processes that started them so they very simply put the processes on the poetic system

37
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:01,360
system produce components while the components produce the person the whole thing is self-generating

38
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:12,800
self-producing. So to make that clear I start from what I call a process on poetry that means

39
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:21,360
I do not at assume that universe is constituted of objects where objects are inert materials

40
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,480
which ultimately people tend to tend to see as particles. I see the universe consisting out of

41
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:37,280
process and a process is something that we can describe formally as action a reaction meaning

42
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:45,040
you have some input things some they react with each other and you get an output and then a system

43
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,920
such as an poetic system then becomes appellate network of processes so instead of start on

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,240
stable elements of I assume it's stability is the result of process that somehow some are debiliters

45
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:14,800
so what are reactions a reaction is kind of like the minimal element of my apology

46
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,480
a reaction assumes that there are conditions which are distinguishable states of it's over there

47
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,960
condition can be the presence of particular molecule of part of biological species but also

48
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:36,720
be something much much more a social condition of worlds or over this anything that can be

49
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:44,080
distinguished from its absence is a condition and then processes represented by arrows could be

50
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:52,560
for example that a distinguishable condition appears a is formed and this variable condition

51
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,360
disappears a condition is transformed into a different condition and some some combinations

52
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:08,720
decisions react react to form a combination of conditions so this is very similar to the world

53
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,040
to the one you think they are in element elementary partition but the ABCDs that are right here they

54
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:23,600
can be any distinguishable conditions so it wasn't an elementary a poetic system it's a system that

55
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:30,160
produce itself but of course it must be term thermodynamically open that means it must have

56
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,800
input from outside and there will be some some dissipation with some waste so in this case I

57
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,200
need to have need to have some in a of a some outlay of b and then a and a and being themselves

58
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:50,480
now that's of course much too simple to have a living system so let's look at it and somewhat

59
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:57,520
more complicated example complicated example in the sense that I have still an input I still have

60
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,440
still still have an input in between I have a net of reaction that's that's much more complicated

61
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,720
but that but that is such that every everything every every component we condition the the base

62
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:19,120
the cities there is always always some produces it but in appears in disappears nothing nothing

63
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,720
enough nothing everything is produced by some reaction and the whole reaction thing is keeping

64
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,440
itself going so so uh for those who are interested describe a mathematical model

65
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,640
all the chemical organization is something called chemical chemical organizing theory in which

66
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,800
which you can at the conditions and a network of reactions becomes also auto poetic meaning

67
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,360
meaning self meaning and closed closed that whatever is consumed is produced whatever is produced is

68
00:08:51,360 --> 00:09:01,200
consumed so now uh where does auto is come from that's kind of the assumption of my ontology

69
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,840
that is that process self of organize into more more complicated organizations since

70
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:14,720
so how I have that that in the simplest I start with a random reaction sections random content

71
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,040
means any any a plus b c plus d's we have we have payments with that we have just generated

72
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,480
random that random network sign then we have seen what's seen what happens is typically

73
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:34,160
that itself organizes into the kind of auto poetic how does that happen to start with

74
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,000
number of components that are available components of our conditions have the reactions

75
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,560
the reactors form the components into components which come themselves out as something something

76
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,200
the new components are on when you see you start with a number of components components you produce

77
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,800
you add you add the new one up to the point that you point that you can alone do once because

78
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,040
there is no material available to available to add anything there yet on the other hand some of

79
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,400
the some of the kind of consumed but they are not produced or not produced enough to keep the whole

80
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:17,360
thing going so you remove them in the end what are you left with with components that are being

81
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:25,280
produced that are being consumed but such that that they are they are being consumed and consumed

82
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:32,640
at the same time so this is a follow-up that I'm going to schedule quickly for this institute you

83
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,360
can look at look at my papers the chemical organization the apoyosis is what is that a

84
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,760
self-maintenance of reactors is an attractor of the dynamics that means that if you let the dynamics

85
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,640
hold on its own eventually you will get something that resembles an autopoietic system or in most

86
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:59,760
cases that the apopoietic system will trivial but in principle you can generate an apoyotic system

87
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:08,960
like that to self-organization now what one thing to get to is that the apopoietic system should

88
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:16,240
not maintain itself in real circumstances that mean ideal circumstances where all the input

89
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:26,000
components are not there but in the presence of an environment where things are not always

90
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,480
available sometimes there are conditions that are interfering with your reactions sometimes the

91
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:41,840
conditions you need for your reactions are not there so I've said that the apoyotic regime is

92
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,200
an attractor but there will be the patients that will be pushing the system out of its

93
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,000
attractor so if we think about the apopoietic system as a kind of a very primitive organism that

94
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,040
organ lacks food so even at the moment there's not enough impotence it will die on the other

95
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:09,280
hands it it may die because of toxin that means components that interfere with the reactions

96
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:20,560
that are necessary to the whole thing align so first stage is the system of organisms into

97
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,480
something self-maintaining second age that self-maintaining system being thrown around by

98
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:35,200
perturbants most most of them are killed by perturbations but eventually we may assume

99
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:43,120
evolution will lead to another system that's resilient resilient that means that it is able

100
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,360
to bounce back from these perturbations that there are all kinds of changes happening in the

101
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,520
environment it can somehow compensate for these perturbations that means for example

102
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:03,360
some some components of you that's previously worked as toxins that means they are perturbing

103
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:11,280
the metabolism your version apopoietic system the more resilient and will have some way to

104
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:19,440
neutralize these toxins since if for example the food is not available maybe it will have developed

105
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:27,920
some internal reactions to digest a different type of food so i'm assuming that if the process of

106
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,360
evolution goes on long enough the system will become more and more and more resilient we have

107
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,600
done a number of simulations with these networks and indeed you see that if you give it enough time

108
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,480
the time it tends to become more resilient so so what does it mean resilient in terms of

109
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:53,600
dynamic systems it means that the auto system is an attracter it's basic basic of attack means

110
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:01,920
all all the options that lead to the attracter become exciting will become wider it will have

111
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:11,200
a wider range of viability so let's imagine this the dark green that you see is the attracter that

112
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:19,440
means that is the autopoietic regime which the system tries to turn the light is the base that

113
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,720
means all of the different regulations from which the autopoietic system can back to its

114
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:36,080
its regime of sitenance a partition then means means any unregulated change that makes the system

115
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:43,360
move from one position to another as long as the perturbations remain inside the basin they

116
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,760
will automatically be compensated because as long as the system is in the basin it will on its own

117
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,880
go to the reactor if on the other hand perturbation can push the system outside of the basin then it

118
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,640
will no longer go with the attracter which means that basically the autopoietic system

119
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,800
longer autopoietic that cannot maintain itself what could potentially potentially happen is

120
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,960
also a different attracter attracter potentially could be could be even better let's not discuss that here

121
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:27,200
so that allows me now to define directness as resilient autopoiesis

122
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:35,120
autopoiesis is the attracter as autopoiesis this means if you perturb it from the attracter if

123
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:44,160
you put it out of the attracter it will come back it has a one basin and basin is is a growing

124
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:53,760
process of self-made so it's not an equilibrium like a thermo system versus thermo thermodynamic

125
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,080
equilibrium that is not a living system a living system is a process that is actively

126
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:08,240
self-maintaining that is consuming and producing so operation what does that mean a goal-directed

127
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,720
system if it's not in goal it will move towards the goal if it's in the goal it will stay in goal

128
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,880
if it perturbed it means if it's pushed off its goal it will it will perform

129
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:28,000
action that requires energy so as so as to return to that so that we might kind of a

130
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,960
minimal thing of goldness in living living systems a basic basic form of aid

131
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:44,720
now we come to the issue of cognition so goal-directed activity we can say requires

132
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,600
a minimal form of cognition because it needs to be able to compensate the deviations from the rule

133
00:16:52,640 --> 00:17:01,520
so if we look from the inside autopoietic system it undergoes a deviation it should it should somehow

134
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,480
do something that there is that there is a deviation that that means it needs some ability

135
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,320
ability of person of something thing and it should also have an ability to perform an action that

136
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:20,480
means one of its repertoire of reactions should switch on so as to neutralize the deviation

137
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:29,760
and implicit in this whole dynamic is the notion of knowledge namely action that still gets

138
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,640
by the sun's condition should be appropriate for that to that condition so the sun should

139
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:42,960
somehow know which action to perform for which condition and that now model model with additional

140
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:54,640
format is used in AI action rules so function rules you have an agent the agent has a number of

141
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,680
condition action rules that means it recognizes a certain condition for example it

142
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:09,200
senses that is condition X and it knows if I'm in condition X then I should perform action Y

143
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,920
and we can help with that simply as a process X to Y that process in one of the processes inside

144
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,800
this complex network processes that in a poetic system system

145
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:30,640
now cognition are lots of definitions of cognition and we need to be

146
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,280
to be careful about what we mean by cognition so one of the more interesting results from

147
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:46,000
cyber ethics is so-called the law of regulatory models proposed by Conant and Ashby and it says

148
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,720
if you want to have a directed system standard girl direct system must include some mapping

149
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,680
which they call a model namely it should map all the potential deviation perturbations

150
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:08,000
the right action that means for deviation there should one specific action that mapping exists

151
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:18,000
then the system is able to control to reach girl and that's model we might say implement the

152
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,800
systems like now model is a common term when thinking about evolution the system has a model

153
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,880
of its environment but that is not the way the way that Maturana Varela interpreted

154
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:39,600
Ryan and Varela and size it what Conant and Ashby call it is not a representation of the

155
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,880
environment what they say is the is the audit system is autonomous it functions functions

156
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:55,120
it does not know what is going on in the external world the only thing that we can know is

157
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:04,640
the deviations its senses it has a metabolism it has a network processes when one of its processes

158
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,720
is functioning the way it should be the whole whole poetic system is perturbances that

159
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,640
there is something wrong but it does not know what lost the deviation so Maturana Varela

160
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:29,520
emphasized that this kind of knowledge is subjective the auto poetic system knows only

161
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:37,360
the things that affect its own auto poetic auto poetic it does not represent the environment

162
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:46,400
in some objective way so now we become to the further evolution so we only have a system that

163
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:55,920
is almost that is girl like that has some level of cognitive but but he can think this cognition

164
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:03,600
mission should accept the system be able to adapt adapt these conditions and and lots of

165
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:11,040
if there is a lot of variation in the environment the conditions will change so that means the

166
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:17,520
system should be able to sense emotions should be able to interpret the conditions it should be

167
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:24,080
able to make sense of the conditions that its senses so it requires that it has some elementary

168
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:30,160
awareness not not really of what objectively going on in the environment but

169
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:39,840
in what in what way are changing in the environment so that it affects itself so

170
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:50,000
so we let let evolution its role the system will need to become more aware more and more and more

171
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:58,160
in so that it can recognize a wider range of of conditions and can interpret them and perform

172
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:07,360
the right types of actions so so now this is a scheme that you probably seen which I borrow from

173
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:21,600
Michael he called the cognitive viability I have only the cone of OS so if an agent that is

174
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:29,840
situated somewhere in the middle of that of that cone agent will to some extent be aware of

175
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,840
what is going on in its environment from this purely specific point of view but still it will

176
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:48,160
to some degree be aware of conditions in the past in the future in the neighborhood so the cone

177
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:55,280
kind of kind of represents the range of awareness the kind of kind of range of the system the

178
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:04,640
potential makes sense the more advanced the system the wider the cone so here is another picture

179
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:12,640
that I took from Michael here are some examples of cones a very small creature like a pig will have

180
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:20,320
a very small cone a human can have a very big cone and a dog can have something in between

181
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:29,200
but now I come I make a very very big jump I started by it by explaining how the boy has

182
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:38,480
this this which is the organization of a single like a big theorem and now I'm making a jump

183
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:50,320
in human consciousness so let's forget about all the stages model the cellularity animals

184
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,880
nervous systems etc but what is the essence of the different between the cognition of a

185
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:05,360
vacuum and the cognition of human or in bacteria the way I use the con the the cognition is

186
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,280
deterministic the the being sense is a part is a particular con performs a part of a particular

187
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,360
always the same condition leads to same action now we're speaking about higher organisms organisms

188
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,640
and we humans are there but probably others probably apes talking sense other mammals and

189
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:34,880
maybe both are also there but there is an intermediate decision making stage that means

190
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:42,400
there is a condition that the organism senses and then there is a state here I have called reflection

191
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:52,800
of considering different of all ways of reacting to that condition condition means that the action

192
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:01,280
follows so a part of reflection action and actually there is no action I I make some of

193
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:07,760
the conditionation in women I can decide I need to act in this way or I can decide there is no

194
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:17,360
action words taking so this is what's called free will we humans have the ability to consider

195
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:24,320
many different forces and to choose one of them and that is typically what we will

196
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,840
will call conscious ability of considering different possibilities

197
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:40,880
now define it's easiest to distinguish conscious or subconsciousness so we humans

198
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:49,680
still have the same level of subconscious reactions like bacteria and like simple organism we have

199
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:58,480
this kind of automatic involuntary reflex for example if I put my hand on a hot so I will

200
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:07,520
pull it away immediately I don't need to think about what this is hot if my hand on it on it

201
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,800
then it will burn therefore I should pull it pull away my I will just pull away my way my

202
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:21,440
and I may not feel the heat of the of the stuff so that process implemented in the brain it's

203
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,960
modeled as what is not a speed forward process it's a process that goes straight from

204
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:37,840
sense condition to action they stay immediate way there are no details now what's the difference

205
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:45,200
with with the conscious process a conscious process is a process that we can monitor we can in

206
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:53,040
our mind minds we know what we are thinking we can I mean our thoughts also redirect our

207
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:01,040
for example I may distract this and tell myself no you should be busy with that you should be

208
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:08,560
doing that so conscious processes are processes I define as processes in the mind that can be

209
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:15,600
monitored that can be examined and that can be redirected of all the different different

210
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,560
many different theories of consciousness though that I like the most the one that I think

211
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:27,120
explained this is also was was complete is so-called global neural space theory

212
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:36,240
theory and the most active active research is stony stony slas and what the global

213
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:46,480
neural workspace analysis is that it is some kind of a special network the workspace which

214
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:53,360
functions a bit like a kind of a forum or a meeting space where lots of different

215
00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:03,120
process is coming from and part of the building come together and the process in that workspace

216
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:13,760
they are all what all circulate the other term other people people call it really

217
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:21,200
or recurrence resonance but the main idea is it's a process a forward process that means

218
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:29,360
a process that goes in one direction it's a process that that cycles around and what is the

219
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:37,760
reason for the cycling problem with activation of neurons in the brain is that activation

220
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:44,720
passed on new neurons do remain activated so you want to keep some keep some new working memory

221
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,240
you need to recreate the activation and you can and you can only by having the active activation

222
00:28:52,240 --> 00:29:00,320
come back to the space and then that's for me now the essence of what creates the consciousness

223
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:09,040
by keeping this total of this perception active in your memory you can inspect this

224
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,760
and if you can inspect it that means other parts of the brain can look at this other

225
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,160
other part of the brain intervening and is now what will create a free so I will

226
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:32,080
it's best explained with owing so this is the scheme for the conscious processing the feet forward

227
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:41,040
propagation so what you have is just a line the sensors some some condition there are a number

228
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:48,080
of immediate new neural modules that process information for example if I see something

229
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:55,600
there are different layers in my visual cortex that will first recognize light and dark and then

230
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:03,760
recognize edges and then they will recognize shapes and then they recognize objects it leads

231
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:13,920
a particular conclusion in the example I gave the of the hand on a hot stove

232
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:22,240
here probably it may not even reach the brain it may just go to the spinal cord but

233
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:31,200
the sensors send a signal that that eventually be pulled away by hands it just a fourth process

234
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:43,120
so now of course processing that is what I call all circuiting active activation we have the

235
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:51,840
sensors here on the bottom left left the sun provide input input the effect effectors my muscles

236
00:30:52,640 --> 00:31:01,120
are put on the system but before it reaches the effectors the activation circulates in what

237
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:09,040
called the global workspace which is some kind of a a suit to be a network of on-range connections

238
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:17,680
in the cortex and then you have the diff modules which are specialized circuits that for example

239
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:28,960
recognize sounds or look openings or or make equations or or fractions the the most can be

240
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:37,840
very diverse very specialist but these models now interact with what's going on in the workspace

241
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,720
that means that what happens in the workspace the activation that's circulating can go to a

242
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:53,760
to one of the modules which the module doesn't do anything with it on the other hand it can go to

243
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,320
a module module reacts so it's an interaction action or there can be a module that receives

244
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,720
infusion from a different part of the brain and that some some input in our workspace space so

245
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:14,160
our workspace is seen as a kind of a form a kind of a public or all these specialized

246
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:20,960
best circuits and they're in a kind of a discussion it's as if they are talking together in this

247
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:29,280
global workspace space so here here there are some examples of from the of the where they are

248
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:37,680
doing experiments with all these and you can give them here so-called sub-subliminals that

249
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:43,840
means something that I think that a visual stimulus and disappears so quickly quickly that

250
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,840
the monkey doesn't have the unconscious of it of it and you see this kind of a field of field

251
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:57,840
activity that means that for the input the the the the neurons get directly activated and they pass

252
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:05,600
their output to another of neurons but it moves basically in one direction on the other hand if

253
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:12,320
you leave the stimulus for a long enough time that the monkey becomes conscious of it now that's

254
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:19,200
what they call reverberation what I call circulation now you see that the different created neurons

255
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,960
the sensation back and forth everything is keeping itself self-indulgent

256
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:36,640
that is a standard model of consciousness or what is called access consciousness the

257
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:43,760
consciousness in the sense that you have access to what's going on in your mind you have the ability

258
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:51,360
to examine to monitor to read whatever is going on in your mind but now there is another aspect

259
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,280
of consciousness that is subjective experience and associated with this with this whole

260
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:06,720
problem of consciousness what is a subjective experience it is feeling that that is something

261
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,600
that you are conscious and that subjective experience I personally prefer the term

262
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:21,280
subjective experience but some other terms you may have heard are qualia acqua is an individual

263
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:29,040
subjective experience it's also called phenomenal consciousness and a most common phase define what

264
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:37,760
what a qualia or a subjective subjective experience that what is it like like to for example what what

265
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,960
is it to see see hurt now typically typical example loss of his health healthness is subjective

266
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:52,800
experiences is something else as an input but you have the subjective experience of healthness

267
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,280
so the heart problem of consciousness is what precisely are these subjective experience

268
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,880
why do we have these subjective experiences and the famous uh thought experiment that kind of

269
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,640
hind the whole heart heart problem of conscious was uh discussed by the philosopher david

270
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,600
charmer it's the zombie thought experiment so so what he does david david charmers he thinks that

271
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:29,840
there are certain speech he calls zombies that behave just like any normal being but they don't

272
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:40,080
have subjective experience so he imagines that the zombie would put his hands on a hot stove and the

273
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:48,160
zombie would he would pull away his hands and ask the zombie what happens the the zombie will tell

274
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:56,000
i felt hot pain but actually the zombie didn't feel any so the thought experiment is that the zombie

275
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,080
behaves like a normal normal human being but actually he doesn't doesn't have subjective

276
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:07,120
experience and then the heart problem is since by definition we cannot cannot see between a zombie

277
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:14,720
and in a human being we cannot do a scientific experiment that we explain what the human being

278
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:22,640
has subjective experience what the zombie likes yeah to me that is a meaningless thought

279
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,480
experiment because if there is really no way that that i can distinguish only from a human human being

280
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,320
all all of you can be or none of you of you can be zombies any of you can be a zombie to me that is

281
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:45,440
not not a good way to good way to define it so let's explain something subjective explain

282
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,800
my point the point of view first question a question that philosophers to my surprise

283
00:36:52,800 --> 00:37:01,840
have a lot of difficulties with why is experience subjective why i can't be just objectively see

284
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:08,480
the way things things are so so for me it appears humans are autoplay systems

285
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:16,880
autoplay systems as i said in me cannot objectively believe the world they do have access

286
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:25,920
to opt out in the in the world they only have access to her perterops their self-maintaining

287
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:32,160
processes whatever interferes with their metabolism if something interferes with my

288
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,280
metabolism that means for for example that it leads to the releases of newer transmitters

289
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:47,360
if in particle cells then i can feel that perturbation of my metabolism but but i do not access

290
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,000
to think itself though

291
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:59,520
the thing that follows so much from my theory of poyesis is is that autopoietic processes by

292
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:07,920
definition they are not neutral they care about what happens to them they distinguish between

293
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:15,200
good things and bad things whatever helps them to maintain themselves such as food

294
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:23,280
they see as positive whatever interferes with the autopoietic such as a plate that can burn them

295
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:31,280
they will see as negative so from an autopoietic point of view all all experiments of course

296
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:39,600
happen from an internal thousand perspective i can only perceive the world from inside my own body

297
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:48,400
inside my own brain and what i i perceive as neutral is not objective it is colored by

298
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:57,440
my goals which is to stay alive and that is why for example have a different perception between

299
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:07,040
let's say a butterfly and a wasp i butterflies i don't like wasps i know that wasps can be

300
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:15,040
which will which will interfere with my autopoiesis so and biology might say you should be more you

301
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:22,640
should be objective objective butterflies wasps are just insects but i'm likely to kill the

302
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,320
the the wasp and not the butterfly

303
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,120
so now

304
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:39,200
so the subjective experience affects my autopoietic process so what does that mean

305
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,760
effect i'm using using effect now so in the psychology also an effect is something that

306
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:53,680
acts on all that means it pushes or pulls me pulls me towards it like for example for example it's

307
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,360
if there is food i will be attracted to the food on the other hand it will push me away away from

308
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:06,400
things are dangerous from disturbances it will push me away from the hot plate or from the wasp

309
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,080
and that is a typical old world directed system there is a classic example of bacteria

310
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:22,960
taxis bacteria can substance food molecules and toxin models and and they are to follow

311
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,800
a gradient towards the food or away from the toxins so that's what we

312
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,480
define elementary entry agency of the world directedness bacteria are affected by what

313
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:45,680
happened at one effect there but there is not that conscious effects so now i finally

314
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:54,480
turn to my solution of the heart problem of business it's what i call local field model

315
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:02,640
i've also been the local prospect model so effects are equivalent to four these things that push push

316
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:11,840
or pull on the other hand godness tells me that i don't just just immediately react react take the

317
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:18,240
time to come to consider our different different process that push and pull in different direction

318
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:27,760
so there is a range of potential actions now a range is something like a space if i put a force

319
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,640
across a range i get what in mathematics or in physics called a field i could have presented

320
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:42,320
as a kind of a vector field across a space of potential potentiality that means potential

321
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:50,320
reactions i i would have but but this i do not do not know what one under all circumstances

322
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:56,720
there is this cognitive the field the field is flow emanates from the here the here now

323
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:08,880
and the farther away in space of time the less my my idea will be what what the field is

324
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:19,120
so how how can we even this local field in the brain i go back to my to my picture of the

325
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,800
workspace there is a circling activation so in the global space there is this this

326
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,920
phase activation but the activation to some the greeks it's a process process spreading

327
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:40,240
activation in uh in psychomes i think that are are asserts that are related to that are in the

328
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:47,280
global workspace will receive some leaking activation and that leaking activation in a

329
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:54,560
sense pairs the way for potentially the next action or the next total or the next interpretation

330
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:03,440
so the diffusing activation diffusing from the global workspace that's a sense forms

331
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:10,160
the local the local post which to to be is the subjective experience

332
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,080
uh we'll skip that that one

333
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:24,240
so this local field it's a conceptual model the reason that nowadays i prefer to call it local

334
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,440
prospect is that that's the first time i started explaining it to people working consciousness

335
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:36,800
everybody i assumed that i was imagining some some kind of a mechanical field

336
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:44,160
emanating from my my brain and the field is purely a mathematical concept or a

337
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,440
conceptual model it's not a physical physical field on the other hand on the other hand i'm using

338
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,720
field because because field is something you can explain matter in matter so that means that

339
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:01,600
potentially i hope that they will eventually be able to make a mathematical model or computer

340
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,520
model of what the subjective experience would be

341
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:15,600
so in consciousness we speak about about so-called neural correlates of core consciousness

342
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:22,640
the subjective experience that you feel the neural correlates the activity that is actually

343
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:30,320
not noticeable in the brain and this neural correlate format for me it's a term that i took

344
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:39,600
from uh the neural uh uh that was steven goes i call it an adaptive resonance resonance because

345
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:46,800
it is kind of self-maintaining circulation of activity adaptive because it constantly adapts

346
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:54,000
to things to inputs and outputs so there's activation that is kind of self-maintaining

347
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,280
within work memory in the global global workspace that activation in and out of out of the resonance

348
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:08,960
like that it moved one direction action all year and initially the activation again can

349
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:16,800
do the different actions and then and then it assists it choose the action rather than

350
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,400
the other potential it's a little bit available to the collapse of the wave function in quantum

351
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:29,120
mechanics if your field of activation is diffusing can be seen as a wave then at a certain moment

352
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:35,680
when you make a decision to do this or that it's like like the wave of it but then immediately

353
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:48,640
when it starts spreading again so five free willful uh i see brain as a elective specialized

354
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:56,000
modules these as modules or circuits we can see them as kind of agents within the society of mind

355
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:04,640
these agents interact they have a discussion the discussion takes place in these global

356
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:13,200
workspaces and why is the world free because you can say beforehand what the art of discussion

357
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:20,080
will be it's as if you different different people with different unions and different different

358
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:28,400
backgrounds ever to get about whatever whatever political problem you do not know beforehand

359
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,760
what solution they will come out on art because they are they are confronted with perspectives

360
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:40,640
that have not been confronted before as each speaks in turn that means there is a very strong

361
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:48,320
effect of who speaks when timing state date etc you cannot predict what discussion will be

362
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,520
it's a non-linear process that means that it's subject to what's called it's called the butterfly

363
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:02,080
effect meaning meaning that very differences in activation of timing can can lead to these outcomes

364
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:09,120
in other words whole process isn't predictable why we call it for it free it is not it's not

365
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:18,560
deterministic so again the same picture the society of mind now now we look at the modules

366
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:24,240
as if they are agents each agent has certain opinions certain things that are particularly

367
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:31,840
important certain things you know certain things it's good at and that's agent is is

368
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:39,520
some of its opinion in the workspace is where all the agents can react to it and their opinion

369
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:46,720
opinion to it whole thing is is evaluated in interaction different agents agency

370
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:55,760
so here i go back to the picture i i took from michael where he speaks about compound intelligence

371
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:03,920
is cells together have a higher level of intelligent cognition than individual cells

372
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:10,640
be because they interact act because they are in this kind of kind of discussion the same thing

373
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:17,280
for for organisms like arms same for you or humans at each level each level we can

374
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,280
cognition mission is beauty is collective if

375
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:30,000
so the the moments are different agents that become coupled that means that they are in some

376
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
relationship that's relatively stable i know that they will exchange new information because one

377
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,160
will react what the other one does the orbit of the one becomes becomes the input of the other

378
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:50,560
and vice versa cells travel from from agent to agent and and that allows a more this or

379
00:48:50,560 --> 00:49:00,080
collective intelligent my first example was a bacterial cell apopoietic network network that

380
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:05,680
consists of actions each of the action of the action of the molecules is you might say a very

381
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,840
primitive that is in acting with all the others to gather they form apopoietic network

382
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:19,360
when i look at the human brain i the agents are different models that are helping putting their

383
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:25,280
discussion in the global workspace and finally in society we might say different people are

384
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,640
discussing in what we call the northern north sphere the worldwide crop crop the

385
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,440
uh gen genitals fee in which communications are

386
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:48,640
fine finally in russian what i have to do is to do a kind of a natural history of agency starting

387
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:55,760
from the very simplest agents which are the outcome of reaction networks that self-organize

388
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,520
these reaction networks tend to become but close and self-containing meaning that they are

389
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:10,320
autopoietic as simple apopoietic systems are uh uh they're going for the innovations they need to

390
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:16,160
learn to adapt to adapt that means they need to learn to learn to condition action action rules

391
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,600
you know in this in this condition i need to perform perform this action to survive fine

392
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:27,920
and in human brains we have the additional stage of consciousness that means that the

393
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:34,560
condition action rules are no longer automatic condition automatically leading to action

394
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:42,400
thus we will get an intermediate stage of of circulation where activate thoughts feelings

395
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:49,120
are serrating in what's called the global journal workspace that circulation defines

396
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:55,440
a local possible possible development months out of these these potential demands

397
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:02,080
eventually chosen and the one that is one that is is chosen collectively collaboratively

398
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:12,320
by the different models are discussing so uh i think we still have time for a few questions

399
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:18,960
great thank you um any questions

400
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:29,280
sure i'll ask a question this is chris um thanks thanks for your talk

401
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,680
you characterize the environment as a source of perturbations

402
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:44,960
and you also mentioned that autopoiesis is an attractor in the state space of a complex system

403
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,800
so do you consider the environment to be itself an autopoietic system

404
00:51:53,120 --> 00:52:02,000
uh that's an interesting term uh this is part of a broader perspective which are relational

405
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,880
agency if if you look at an ecosystem you can see the system as a as a whole as a

406
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:16,560
poetic system in the in the sense that there are flows of uh was it being consumed consumed

407
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:23,040
and produced so an ecosystem a whole would also be an autopoietic system in that sense

408
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,600
okay great thank you

409
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,880
anyone else

410
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:44,880
um hi uh i do i do have a question um could you elaborate a little bit about uh your response

411
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:51,840
to the zombie criticism or are you are you thinking that uh a zombie autopoietic system

412
00:52:51,840 --> 00:53:01,600
cannot exist uh what exactly are your thoughts there this curious okay uh uh it's it's a kind

413
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:09,040
of a metaphysical assumption uh which which light means the identity of the indistinguishables

414
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:17,200
so what's given by that is if you cannot distinguish two things if there is no no you can say

415
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:23,200
i have only here and i have a human here i can distinguish the one from the other some way

416
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:30,720
then the identity of the distinctions zombies are humans so so for me

417
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:37,600
isolating a distinction lead to any other the other distinction is meaningless yes another way

418
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:43,200
to formulate it is it's called the difference that makes it if you start by postulating a

419
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,880
difference between zombies and humans then it should make some other difference just postulating

420
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:55,920
a difference that does not lead to any any difference to me it's useful that it's making

421
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:05,920
things complicated that shouldn't be made complicated so the the main question really

422
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,880
for me is is why do we subjective experience experience why do we something for example

423
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:19,440
if we look at and and we feel because the as the color is a signal that has certain meaning

424
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:26,320
for us that we have associated for example with the warm or with action and that makes us do certain

425
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:33,760
things harder than others so the color that will influence me in a different way than the color

426
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:42,000
blue and that is what the subjective experience is yeah i the way i always understood the zombie

427
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,880
criticism was that subjective experiences is not necessary to do the kind of things that

428
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:55,600
organisms as complex as humans can do but we do have subjective experience which

429
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:01,840
is it may have been a product of evolution and maybe it plays a a role
