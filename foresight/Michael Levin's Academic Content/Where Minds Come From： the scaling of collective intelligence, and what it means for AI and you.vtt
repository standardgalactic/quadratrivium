WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
So thanks everybody for being here and letting me share some some ideas with you. If anybody's

00:06.000 --> 00:11.360
interested in the details of it, you can track them down at this website. Here's all the papers,

00:11.360 --> 00:17.680
the software, the data sets, everything. Here is where I put some more speculative kinds of things

00:17.680 --> 00:22.160
where I talk about what I think the papers mean and so on. So you're welcome to welcome to check

00:22.160 --> 00:28.080
them out. What I'm going to talk to you about today is kind of a weird topic. I'm going to talk about

00:29.040 --> 00:34.720
a little bit about AI and the right way to understand AI through the lens of collective

00:34.720 --> 00:40.880
intelligence. In other words, we're going to take a kind of a deep dive into where minds come from

00:40.880 --> 00:47.680
so that we can actually talk about this notion of whether artificial minds have the same status as

00:47.680 --> 00:52.320
biologically evolved ones and so on. And so we're going to look at those kind of questions.

00:52.400 --> 00:59.680
So the main points of today, what I'd like to do is this. We're going to look under the hood

00:59.680 --> 01:07.600
of biology a little bit to kind of clear out some viewpoints and some terminology that's

01:07.600 --> 01:13.040
persisted with us for centuries, basically, but I think are going to have to change and this idea

01:13.040 --> 01:20.560
of discrete natural kinds in biology. So we'll talk about that. We'll talk about diverse intelligence

01:20.560 --> 01:25.840
in particular collective intelligence. So very kind of unconventional minds and unconventional

01:25.840 --> 01:30.880
cognitive systems. And I'm going to argue that all the things that people argue about today in

01:30.880 --> 01:37.520
terms of artificial intelligence are basically kind of an off ramp to a much deeper, more difficult

01:37.520 --> 01:42.640
discussion about the really deep philosophical questions about what we are, what about freedom

01:42.640 --> 01:47.200
of embodiment and things like that. It's actually much more, it's a much more complicated set of

01:47.200 --> 01:53.280
questions than just to focus on kind of today's AIs. And so we'll talk a little bit at the end

01:53.280 --> 01:59.760
about the ethics and the future of humanity and things like that. So let's start with this.

01:59.760 --> 02:03.600
This is a well-known painting. It's called Adam Names the Animals in the Garden of Eden.

02:05.360 --> 02:11.680
Here he is. So this is the old Judeo-Christian story where animals are showing up and Adam

02:11.680 --> 02:16.800
gets to name them. Now, something important about that story is that actually it was on Adam

02:16.800 --> 02:20.160
to name the animals. God couldn't do it. The angels couldn't do it. Adam was the one that

02:20.160 --> 02:24.080
had to name them. I think that's a very interesting part of that story. And I think for us it has

02:24.080 --> 02:30.160
two lessons. One that we're going to have to break, I think, as the future moves on. And the other

02:30.160 --> 02:34.880
one that's actually very deep and that we're going to have to dive into. The part that has to be

02:34.880 --> 02:41.040
given up is this notion that all of these species are discrete. They're natural kinds. Everybody

02:41.040 --> 02:46.080
knows what each of these are. They're separate from the others. In fact, Adam is also a discrete

02:46.080 --> 02:51.760
entity and completely different from all of the others. And this idea that you can sort of

02:51.760 --> 02:56.560
number and categorize very, very specific types of beings. And that's what they're,

02:56.560 --> 03:02.800
you can sort of count the animals in your environment. As you'll see in a minute,

03:02.800 --> 03:09.920
I think that idea has to go. But what's deep is this notion that Adam, because he is the one

03:09.920 --> 03:15.680
that has to live with him, he is the one that has to give them names. Now, in these old traditions,

03:15.680 --> 03:20.000
giving something a name was very deep and spiritual. It meant that you've discovered

03:20.000 --> 03:24.480
their true nature. Knowing the name of something means you know their true nature. And as I'm

03:24.480 --> 03:29.360
going to show you at the end of this talk, because of synthetic biology and bioengineering and some

03:29.360 --> 03:34.800
other disciplines, we are going to have to name or discover the true nature of all kinds of unusual

03:34.800 --> 03:41.760
creatures that you guys will all be living with in your lifetime. So let's start there. Here's

03:41.760 --> 03:49.520
the part that has to break. So here's a normal modern human. Lots of philosophy talks about the

03:49.520 --> 03:54.640
human mind that does this and that and humans have responsibilities and rights and all the

03:54.640 --> 04:00.960
interesting things. But we know that now, because of evolution and also because of developmental

04:00.960 --> 04:06.560
biology, that this is not a sharp category. In other words, if you just track backwards in time,

04:07.120 --> 04:13.680
these modern humans are at a particular point in the evolution of a lineage that goes all the

04:13.680 --> 04:18.720
way back to single cell organisms. So if you have something to say about humans, you might ask yourself,

04:18.720 --> 04:24.160
well, what about the humans of a couple of hundred thousand years ago? What about the hominids of a

04:24.160 --> 04:31.120
couple million years ago? What about them? And just understand that all these changes are slow

04:31.120 --> 04:35.040
and gradual. And the same thing about development. Whatever you think is true of humans with their

04:35.040 --> 04:42.880
true hopes and dreams and cognitive responsibilities and so on. At one point, they were a single cell

04:42.880 --> 04:48.240
and this process is again very slow and gradual. And so we know now that there's this continuum,

04:48.240 --> 04:53.280
right? It's not just a discreet human, but actually a whole continuum of forms that you might have

04:53.280 --> 04:58.640
to decide what is the status of these other forms. Not only that, but there's this other continuum

04:58.640 --> 05:05.920
going horizontal here in my diagram, where we know that humans are going to be modified and

05:05.920 --> 05:10.960
improved. So for various health applications, but also for augmentation technologies,

05:11.680 --> 05:16.960
there's no particular reason why anybody is going to want to be stuck in the body that random vagaries

05:16.960 --> 05:21.840
of evolution left them with. So, you know, I don't think anybody really thinks that a mature,

05:21.840 --> 05:26.800
modern humanity, you know, a hundred years from now is going to be susceptible to the same dumb

05:26.800 --> 05:31.680
diseases, lower back pain, astigmatism, viruses. You know, presumably all that is going to get

05:31.680 --> 05:37.680
fixed. There's nothing magic about where evolution happened to have dropped us. And so there are

05:37.680 --> 05:43.200
technological modifications. There are biological modifications that will be made. And that's because

05:43.200 --> 05:48.960
at every level of organization in our bodies from subcellular materials all the way up,

05:48.960 --> 05:54.080
you can introduce different kinds of novel engineered components. And so all of this is

05:54.080 --> 05:59.040
now possible. And again, if you have thoughts about what a human is versus what a machine is,

05:59.040 --> 06:03.760
you have to ask yourself, how are you going to distinguish this when you are confronted with

06:03.760 --> 06:09.280
all sorts of beings along this continuum? You know, you're going to need to find ways to relate to

06:09.280 --> 06:14.080
them. And so one of the things that I've been working on for some years now is a framework to

06:14.080 --> 06:21.120
be able to recognize, to create, and to ethically relate to truly diverse intelligences that we

06:21.120 --> 06:25.360
can have relationships with regardless of their composition, meaning what they're made of,

06:25.360 --> 06:30.640
or their origin story, where they evolved, did they come out of a factory or some combination of

06:30.640 --> 06:35.600
those. And that means that we need to think about all of these things. So familiar kinds of creatures

06:35.600 --> 06:40.880
like primates and birds and maybe an octopus and so on. But also all kinds of weird organisms

06:40.880 --> 06:46.720
like colonial organisms, swarms, synthetic engineered new life forms, artificial intelligence

06:46.720 --> 06:52.080
is whether robotic, meaning embodied or pure software AI, and maybe even someday aliens,

06:52.080 --> 06:57.680
right, there's probably some sort of exobiological life form out there somewhere with that at some

06:57.680 --> 07:02.240
point we'll confront. Now, we need to be able to think about all of these in the same way,

07:02.240 --> 07:07.200
regardless of where they came from or what they're made of. Now, I'm not the first person to try for

07:07.200 --> 07:14.000
this. So here's Rosenbluth, Wiener and Bigelow in 1943, trying for this scale all the way from

07:14.000 --> 07:18.720
passive matter. So, you know, rocks and sand and things like that, all the way up to different

07:18.720 --> 07:24.080
kinds of active matter, and then various kinds of computational matter, and agential materials,

07:24.080 --> 07:28.560
which is what I'm going to be talking about today, all the way up to some sort of human

07:28.560 --> 07:34.400
metacognition, you know, complex, complex human kinds of minds and beyond. And the goal of this

07:34.400 --> 07:39.600
kind of framework is not just it's not philosophy. The goal is to first of all, move experimental

07:39.600 --> 07:46.240
work forward. So, part of my framework is a very strong insistence that when you look at something

07:46.240 --> 07:52.080
and you say that's not real cognition or that, you know, that is real, you know, this thing really

07:52.080 --> 07:56.480
does have intelligence. The goal of this is not just to have philosophical feelings about it,

07:56.480 --> 08:04.000
it's to have a toolkit for interacting with these systems that is beneficial, that gives us new,

08:04.080 --> 08:09.680
brings new discoveries, new capabilities, biomedicine, engineering, and so on. And also puts

08:09.680 --> 08:14.000
ethics on a better footing, because these old categories that we've had for a really long time

08:14.800 --> 08:20.240
for how we deal with other beings are really not going to be of use anymore, and the details are

08:20.240 --> 08:27.600
all here if you want to follow that. So, a basic fact from developmental biology is that we all

08:27.600 --> 08:32.000
make this amazing journey from what people call just physics. I really don't like that phrase,

08:32.000 --> 08:37.920
but people use it. So, just physics to a complex mind. So, each of us started life here as a single

08:37.920 --> 08:44.160
cell, a little blob of chemicals, and slowly and gradually it became something like this, or even

08:44.160 --> 08:48.720
something like this. So, you know, a complex metacognitive being who's going to say things about

08:48.720 --> 08:53.520
not being a machine and so on. This process is gradual. You need to understand developmental

08:53.520 --> 08:58.960
biology gives us no magic bright line at which point, boom, you know, you were just chemistry

08:58.960 --> 09:03.120
and physics, but bang, there, there, that this is where the mind appears. There isn't anything

09:03.120 --> 09:08.080
like that. It's a very slow and gradual process. And so, what that means is that scientists and

09:08.080 --> 09:14.560
philosophers need to develop a story of scaling. We need to understand how the properties of this

09:14.560 --> 09:18.480
thing, which follows the laws of chemistry and physics, ends up being something that's also

09:18.480 --> 09:23.440
describable by the laws of psychology and psychoanalysis and things like that.

09:24.400 --> 09:30.880
The reason that this is possible is because we are all made of an agential material, unlike legos

09:30.880 --> 09:35.760
and wood and metal and things like that, that basically just stay where you put them. We are

09:35.760 --> 09:40.160
made of a material with agendas. And so, this is the kind of thing we're made of. This is a single

09:40.160 --> 09:46.640
cell, okay? This happens to be a free-living organism called a lacrimaria. You can see that

09:46.640 --> 09:51.600
it's extremely competent in its local unicellular goals. So, there's no brain, there's no nervous

09:51.840 --> 09:57.040
system, there are no stem cells. But this thing is doing everything it needs to maintain its

09:57.040 --> 10:04.720
physiological, its metabolic, and behavioral goals. So, the first kind of shocking thing to

10:04.720 --> 10:12.320
some people that you need to realize is that we are all made of this interesting kind of

10:12.320 --> 10:16.880
stuff that has its own agendas. I don't have time to tell you about it today, but the reality is

10:16.880 --> 10:22.560
these things, ourselves, can learn. They can actually have pretty complex problem-solving

10:22.560 --> 10:29.600
capacities in different kinds of environments. And so, we are a very interesting construction of a

10:29.600 --> 10:33.680
very unusual type of material with which we are just now starting to learn how to engineer.

10:34.240 --> 10:39.520
But at least, you might think, at least we are a true unified intelligence, right? So,

10:39.520 --> 10:44.960
maybe you can call an ant colony some kind of collective intelligence, but we have a brain

10:44.960 --> 10:50.400
where we feel like a single unified being. So, at least we are a true unified intelligence.

10:50.400 --> 10:56.400
And in fact, René Descartes really liked the pineal gland because there's only one of them

10:56.400 --> 11:01.600
in the brain. And he thought that that's where the human experience was centralized because

11:01.600 --> 11:07.200
there's no multiple aspects of it, there's just one in the brain. But if he had had access to a

11:07.200 --> 11:11.680
microscope, he would have discovered that inside this pineal gland is all this stuff, it's a bunch

11:11.680 --> 11:17.600
of cells, and inside of each of those cells is all this stuff, okay? There isn't one of anything

11:17.600 --> 11:22.480
in the brain, and all of us are collective intelligences. We are all made of parts that do

11:22.480 --> 11:27.840
things. And the real trick here, again, is that scaling story is to tell a convincing,

11:28.880 --> 11:33.040
to give a convincing account of how it is that all these parts give rise to something that is a

11:33.040 --> 11:39.040
centralized, that has the feeling of being a centralized unified self. And so, this is what

11:39.040 --> 11:44.640
my group works on. Now, it's interesting that Alan Turing, who is basically the father of

11:44.640 --> 11:54.000
modern computer science, he was very interested in machine intelligence and in computation and

11:54.000 --> 11:59.200
programmability and things like this. And so, everybody knows that part. But one weird thing

11:59.200 --> 12:04.320
is that he also published this paper called The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, which was

12:04.320 --> 12:08.880
basically an attempt to understand how the chemicals of an embryo organize into order

12:08.880 --> 12:14.560
from their initial disorder. Now, you might wonder why would a guy who's interested in

12:14.560 --> 12:20.640
computation and intelligence and machine minds and things like that, why would he be studying

12:20.640 --> 12:24.320
the chemicals in an embryo? And I think that, although he didn't write about it,

12:24.320 --> 12:31.680
I think that Turing saw a very profound truth, which is that the process by which bodies come

12:31.680 --> 12:36.160
to be in this physical universe, by which your body was self-organized from a bunch of chemicals

12:36.160 --> 12:42.880
in the other side, is very closely related in a profound way to the question of where minds come

12:42.880 --> 12:48.880
from. So, the origin of the self-assembly of your mind and of your body are very related stories,

12:49.760 --> 12:57.520
even though they're treated by completely different communities. So, neuroscience and the

12:57.600 --> 13:03.040
behavioral sciences versus developmental biology, molecular biology, cell biology, typically those

13:03.040 --> 13:06.960
folks do not think they're studying the same thing. And I think they're studying exactly the

13:06.960 --> 13:14.080
same thing just in different components. So, to look a little further into where we come from.

13:14.080 --> 13:20.880
So, this is an embryonic blastoderm. So, that's basically a flat sheet of cells. So, in the

13:20.880 --> 13:25.760
beginning, what will happen is that the egg will get fertilized, it will divide, and then eventually

13:25.760 --> 13:30.400
flatten out and give rise to, at least in amniotes like us, it will give rise to a

13:30.400 --> 13:35.760
flat sheet of cells. So, you can think about like a little disk or something like that. That's just

13:35.760 --> 13:40.080
a couple cell layers thick. And so, here's your disk. And so, let's just imagine there's about

13:40.080 --> 13:44.560
50,000 cells at this point in this disk. And we look at it and we say, ah, there's an embryo,

13:44.560 --> 13:48.080
maybe a human embryo or a mouse embryo or something. Actually, mice have a different

13:48.080 --> 13:52.000
structure than this. They're kind of weird, but let's say rabbit. So, human or rabbit or some other

13:52.880 --> 13:57.920
amniotes. You look at that and you say, there's one embryo, but there's 50,000 cells. What are you

13:57.920 --> 14:01.840
actually counting when you say there's one embryo? Well, what you're counting is,

14:03.200 --> 14:07.280
you're really counting alignment. You're counting the fact that all of those cells

14:07.280 --> 14:13.600
are committed to the same story of what they're going to do in anatomical space. They're all

14:13.600 --> 14:19.520
going to collaborate to build a very particular kind of embryo. They are all connected together

14:19.520 --> 14:23.760
and they are all going to cooperate to do one specific thing, which is to build that.

14:23.760 --> 14:27.600
That's what makes this an embryo. What makes this an embryo is that all of these cells are

14:27.600 --> 14:34.880
committed to the same plan. That doesn't have to be the case. And so, this is some work that was

14:34.880 --> 14:42.480
first done in the 40s. I did it again when I was a grad student in the 96 or so. When you take a

14:42.480 --> 14:49.120
duck embryo and you use a little needle to scratch some scratches into it like that, what you'll see

14:49.200 --> 14:54.240
is these little islands here for the next few hours before they rejoin again, each of these

14:54.240 --> 14:58.240
islands doesn't realize the other one is there. So, what they do is they self-organize a new

14:58.240 --> 15:01.520
embryo. Each one of them thinks they're the only one, so they make an embryo. And when they do

15:01.520 --> 15:08.240
heal up, you end up with this kind of conjoined twin or triplet. You end up with a few individual

15:08.240 --> 15:14.240
animals coming out of the same blastoderm. So, the question of how many beings, how many cells

15:14.400 --> 15:19.440
are actually in an embryo is tricky. It's not fixed by the genetics. It's anywhere from zero to

15:19.440 --> 15:26.560
probably half a dozen or more depending on what happens. The cells arise in this medium, this

15:26.560 --> 15:35.200
cellular blastoderm in real time as a process of physiology. It's not hard-coded. And what that

15:35.200 --> 15:41.200
means is that a self has to put itself together. It has to figure out a border between itself

15:41.200 --> 15:46.320
and the outside world. So, here's three embryonic fields sitting there. Each of these cells has

15:46.320 --> 15:52.080
to decide, am I part of this one, or am I part of that one, or who am I part of? And this kind of

15:52.080 --> 15:58.240
thing, this medium that can fragment or come together to form some number of coherent individuals

15:58.240 --> 16:04.000
is not just for development. This happens in the brain as well. So, we have split brain patients

16:04.000 --> 16:10.240
that have a cut between their two hemispheres that actually end up having, you then find out that

16:10.320 --> 16:14.400
they have actually, in an important sense, there are two individuals in there that have different

16:14.400 --> 16:19.760
opinions and so on. You can have lots of dissociative identity disorders and various other phenomena

16:19.760 --> 16:26.960
that make it clear that it's not so simple as the brain has one cognitive owner and the body

16:26.960 --> 16:34.960
has one embryo. It's actually not that simple. And you learn about this when you think about

16:34.960 --> 16:39.520
something like this. So, here's a rat. You train the rat to press the lever and get a delicious

16:39.520 --> 16:44.880
reward. But the thing is that there are cells in this rat that interact with the lever. There are

16:44.880 --> 16:50.960
cells in this gut that get the sugar, but there is no single cell that has both experiences. So,

16:50.960 --> 16:56.320
who is it that owns this associative memory, the fact that the pellet is associated with pressing

16:56.320 --> 17:01.200
the lever? Who owns that? Well, the owner of that memory is not any individual cell. It's the entire

17:01.200 --> 17:06.480
rat. It has to be because no cell has that experience. And there's a kind of cognitive

17:06.480 --> 17:10.960
glue that operates in this rat, which we know as the nervous system, which allows the rat to know

17:10.960 --> 17:16.240
things the individual cells don't know, such as that these two facts are connected. So, that cognitive

17:16.240 --> 17:22.480
glue is a very interesting thing. We're going to study that more of that momentarily. But I want

17:22.480 --> 17:29.440
to be clear that these animals that you typically hear about are not the only game in town as far

17:29.440 --> 17:33.840
as some very interesting aspects of what the biology is trying to tell you. I'm going to show

17:33.840 --> 17:39.840
you a couple of these examples just to sort of expand our horizons about what we need to understand.

17:40.560 --> 17:45.280
So, here's a caterpillar. This caterpillar lives in a two-dimensional world. It's a soft-bodied

17:45.280 --> 17:49.920
creature. It has a controller, a specific brain that's very well suited for driving this kind of

17:49.920 --> 17:56.400
soft body around. But it needs to turn into this. This is a flying kind of creature with hard elements

17:56.400 --> 18:03.120
and the brain basically, during this metamorphosis process, when the caterpillar turns into the

18:03.120 --> 18:08.320
butterfly, what happens is that the brain is pretty much dissolved. So, most of the connections are

18:08.320 --> 18:13.600
broken. Most of the cells are killed off. Huge refactoring, remodeling, new cells, new brain

18:13.600 --> 18:19.680
is built, quite different, and there's your butterfly. So, that already is kind of amazing.

18:19.680 --> 18:25.600
And you can imagine the sort of philosophical question of what's it like? Never mind what's it

18:25.600 --> 18:30.400
like to be a caterpillar. What's it like to be a caterpillar changing into a butterfly in real

18:30.400 --> 18:34.800
time? Not just on an evolutionary timescale, but in your lifetime drastically. Never mind

18:34.800 --> 18:40.800
puberty. This is a major change. So, that's the first thing. But the second thing is that

18:40.800 --> 18:46.400
it turns out that memories persist through this process. So, a caterpillar that learns

18:46.400 --> 18:51.920
something will still remember it as a butterfly. So, that's amazing. How do memories persist when

18:51.920 --> 18:58.320
the brain is basically getting radically refactored? But it's even more than that because, let's say,

18:58.720 --> 19:03.280
what they did was to train caterpillars to look for leaves at a particular color disc.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.160
That kind of information is completely useless to the butterfly because, first of all, the

19:08.160 --> 19:13.520
butterfly doesn't crawl. It flies. And also, it doesn't eat leaves. So, this process has to be

19:14.080 --> 19:20.080
not just the storage of memory. It has to actively remap from what's important to the

19:20.080 --> 19:24.880
caterpillar to what's important to the butterfly. It has to generalize from the concept of leaves

19:24.880 --> 19:29.200
to the concept of food and from specific crawling motions that you might think is what this

19:29.200 --> 19:33.760
simple animal is remembering to something much more complex, a navigational process that will

19:33.760 --> 19:38.400
actually be implemented by flying here, by completely different muscles and a different

19:38.400 --> 19:45.360
architecture. So, this radical process of change, and you might think about what happens to the

19:45.360 --> 19:51.840
individual identity of this organism and what it would be like if the caterpillar knew what was

19:51.840 --> 19:55.520
coming and said, well, you're going to change radically, but don't worry, you'll still have

19:55.520 --> 19:59.040
some of your memories. It's just your priorities will be different. You love leaves now, but you're

19:59.040 --> 20:04.080
not going to care about leaves at all later and you'll want this weird nectar. What is that like?

20:04.080 --> 20:08.080
And we'll come back to this at the end of the talk. How would you convince a creature like this

20:08.080 --> 20:13.040
that this is a perfectly fine thing for them to go through and are they still here? Is this organism

20:13.040 --> 20:17.440
actually still here by the time you get to this stage? And the reason this is important for us

20:17.440 --> 20:22.800
is because humanity is going to change in a way that's somewhat reminiscent of this.

20:23.680 --> 20:28.320
So, that's one kind of example. Another example are these. These are amazing creatures called

20:28.320 --> 20:33.600
planaria, they're flatworms, and when you train them to expect food on these little bumpy circles,

20:34.240 --> 20:39.040
they will remember, and if you cut off their heads with their brain, the tail will sit there

20:39.040 --> 20:43.680
doing nothing. Eventually, the tail will regrow a brand new head, so they regenerate, every piece

20:43.680 --> 20:48.160
will regenerate, and eventually, when they regenerate, you find that they still remember

20:48.160 --> 20:53.120
the original information. So, the memory, not only does this tell you that the memory can be

20:53.120 --> 20:58.640
stored outside the brain, but also that it can be imprinted onto a new brain as the brain develops,

20:58.640 --> 21:05.120
so the movement of memories through tissues. So, all of this is possible because we have this

21:05.120 --> 21:11.440
amazing multi-scale competency architecture. At every scale in your body, from the molecular

21:11.440 --> 21:17.520
networks to the organs and tissues and even groups, these different layers are not just

21:18.080 --> 21:23.280
biological scales, but actually, they have the ability to solve problems. In other words,

21:23.280 --> 21:28.240
they have competencies in different spaces. In the space of possible gene expressions and

21:28.240 --> 21:36.800
physiological states and anatomical layouts, all of these things have the ability to solve problems.

21:36.800 --> 21:41.600
I don't have time to show you a whole bunch of examples today, but there are some amazing

21:41.600 --> 21:47.680
examples of these things solving various problems. Now, the thing to keep in mind is that we humans

21:47.680 --> 21:54.560
are pretty terrible at detecting intelligence. I mean, we do okay with middle-sized objects

21:54.560 --> 22:01.120
moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space, crows and birds and maybe a dolphin

22:01.120 --> 22:06.400
or something like that. We can kind of recognize those as intelligence, but there

22:06.800 --> 22:13.680
are other spaces in which complex creatures navigate and spend effort and try to achieve

22:13.680 --> 22:20.320
goals and so on. There are gene expression spaces and physiological spaces. I want to focus today

22:20.320 --> 22:27.360
on what's known as anatomical morpho space. It's just basically a multi-dimensional space

22:27.360 --> 22:32.560
of all the different shapes that any structure can have. So, in this particular case, here's a

22:32.560 --> 22:36.400
planarian head and it can have different shapes, and these different shapes correspond to the

22:36.400 --> 22:41.120
different settings of these two control knobs, and so you have this two-dimensional space that

22:41.120 --> 22:47.360
shows you where all the different planarian shapes are. The actuality is for complex organisms,

22:47.360 --> 22:53.520
very high-dimensional space. What I want to look at is, I've told you that we're all made of cells,

22:53.520 --> 23:00.160
that these cells underlie the emergence or the self-assembly of a unified self, both of

23:01.040 --> 23:06.640
them, cognitively and morphologically, and I want to look at how that works.

23:07.680 --> 23:13.840
So, here we are. We start life as a collection of embryonic cells. This is a cross-section

23:13.840 --> 23:21.600
through a human torso. So, just imagine where does this incredible order come from, the structure.

23:21.600 --> 23:26.000
Everything is in the right place, the right shape, the right size, next to the right thing.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.320
Where does this order come from? And at that point, even, I mean, I've given the version of this talk

23:30.320 --> 23:34.640
to middle schoolers, and even nine-year-olds will immediately say, well, it's in the genome.

23:34.640 --> 23:39.680
We know where it is. It's in the human genome. But, of course, we can read genomes now, and we know

23:39.680 --> 23:44.880
that that isn't what the genome specifies at all. The genome talks about proteins. The genome

23:44.880 --> 23:51.120
specifies the tiny molecular hardware that every cell gets to have. This isn't directly in the genome

23:51.120 --> 23:56.800
anymore than the structure of a termite nest or the shape of a spider web is in the genome of

23:56.800 --> 24:01.680
those species. All of this is the outcome of physiology and behavior. It's the outcome of

24:01.680 --> 24:05.600
these cells doing their thing with the hardware that they've been given by their genetics.

24:06.160 --> 24:12.400
So, if the DNA specifies the hardware, how do these cells actually know what to build?

24:12.400 --> 24:16.400
How do they know when to stop? If we want to convince them to repair something that's been

24:16.400 --> 24:22.000
damaged, how do we communicate that to them? And as engineers, we can ask, actually, what

24:22.000 --> 24:26.560
else is possible? What else can we convince them to build? Same exact hardware, but what more could

24:26.560 --> 24:33.040
they build? So, I want to give you a couple of examples of the amazing nature of this process,

24:33.040 --> 24:36.800
because, see, when you look at this, you might think that, well, the biggest thing this thing

24:36.800 --> 24:41.760
has going for it is reliability, that basically it happens the same every single time. And that's

24:41.760 --> 24:46.000
true. Reliability is amazing here, but I want to show you that it's actually much more than that.

24:46.880 --> 24:53.200
What you're looking at here is the cross-section of a little tubule leading to the kidneys of a

24:53.200 --> 25:00.480
psalmander. And normally, there's about eight to 10 of these cells that work together, and they

25:00.480 --> 25:05.120
form this little structure with a space in the middle. You can do this weird trick where you

25:05.120 --> 25:10.800
cause multiple copies of the genetic material to build up in the very early embryo. And so,

25:10.800 --> 25:15.600
when that happens, you still get a normal animal, and it's normal size, but the cells are bigger.

25:15.600 --> 25:19.680
And when you take a cross-section, you find out that, well, the cells are bigger, and so now,

25:20.320 --> 25:26.320
fewer of them created the same kind of lumen. So, let's see where we are so far.

25:27.600 --> 25:33.840
Multiple copies of your chromosome, no problem. Weird cell size, no problem, because you'll scale

25:33.840 --> 25:39.280
it to the number of cells. And most of all, if you make truly gigantic cells, and you do these,

25:39.360 --> 25:46.640
these are, I think, 5N or 6N polyploid newts, when you do this, one single cell bends around itself

25:46.640 --> 25:51.520
to give you the exact same kind of structure. Now, that's remarkable because this is a different

25:51.520 --> 25:55.760
molecular mechanism. This is cell-to-cell communication. This is some sort of cytoskeletal

25:55.760 --> 26:00.880
bending. And so, what this means is that in the service of a particular high-level anatomical

26:00.880 --> 26:06.720
structure, these cells can call on different molecular mechanisms to solve their problem.

26:06.720 --> 26:10.640
Okay? So, they're using different tools in their toolkit to get to where they're going.

26:10.640 --> 26:16.160
That is a very good definition of intelligence, to reuse the affordances you have in the service

26:16.160 --> 26:21.440
of a goal when things change. So, when you're a salamander coming into the world, you don't know

26:21.440 --> 26:25.920
how many copies of your genetic material you're going to have. You don't know how many cells you're

26:25.920 --> 26:30.480
going to have or what the size of the cells are going to be. You still need to be able to get the

26:30.480 --> 26:36.640
job done. So, this is not a matter of just being reliable with fixed parts. This is the idea

26:36.640 --> 26:42.800
that what evolution is making is problem-solving agents. It's making a system that is ready for

26:42.800 --> 26:46.880
many, many unexpected things. And not just environment, not just when somebody bites your

26:46.880 --> 26:52.000
leg off and the salamander regenerates it. No, this is unreliability of your own parts. This is not

26:52.000 --> 26:56.640
even being sure of what you're made of. You really can't depend on much. And that's an amazing thing.

26:56.640 --> 27:00.080
And it's quite different than what you normally get in a biology curriculum where they tell you

27:00.080 --> 27:06.320
that your genome, the purpose of your genome is to carry information from a long time away with

27:06.320 --> 27:11.440
maximal fidelity and to minimize errors. And every cell is going to do whatever the genome

27:11.440 --> 27:17.440
says. And in the end, you get this emergent thing. Actually, that's not at all what's happening here.

27:18.800 --> 27:25.440
Here's another example. We discovered this a few years ago. These tadpoles need to become frogs.

27:25.440 --> 27:30.320
In order for this tadpole face to make a frog face, all the organs have to move. So, the eyes

27:30.320 --> 27:35.200
have to move, the jaws have to move, and so on. And they normally do this quite reliably. But it

27:35.200 --> 27:39.120
was thought to be a hardwired process. You know, people thought that, well, every organ just moves

27:39.120 --> 27:44.320
in the right direction, this fixed amount, and that's it. What we did was we created these so

27:44.320 --> 27:49.040
called Picasso frogs because we wanted to test how much intelligence is actually in that process,

27:49.040 --> 27:53.280
how much, what kind of problems can it solve? So, we scrambled everything. You can see here,

27:53.280 --> 27:56.960
the eyes on the top of the head, the mouth is off to the side, everything is just a complete mess.

27:57.520 --> 28:03.040
And these guys still become normal frogs because all of these organs will move now in novel paths,

28:03.040 --> 28:08.240
paths that these guys don't do, until they get to a correct frog face, and then they stop.

28:08.240 --> 28:14.320
And so, what evolution actually has given you is not a hardwired set of instructions,

28:14.320 --> 28:19.360
but a system for error minimization. Okay, for a way of wherever you happen to start out,

28:19.360 --> 28:23.280
do whatever you have to do to end up in this particular location. This again,

28:23.280 --> 28:27.280
this kind of goal-directedness is something else that you're not going to see in your

28:27.280 --> 28:32.720
developmental biology textbook. This is not emergence, and this is not simply an increase

28:32.720 --> 28:38.400
of complexity. This is problem-solving. And that raises an obvious question about how does it know

28:38.400 --> 28:44.160
what the correct face looks like? Where is the memory for that set point of that homeostatic

28:44.160 --> 28:48.880
process? I want to show you a couple of other things related to the plasticity of this. So,

28:48.880 --> 28:55.520
just so you understand how much play there is between the fixed hardware of your genetics

28:55.520 --> 29:00.240
and the actual outcomes. First of all, this here, you might think this is a photoshop or

29:00.240 --> 29:05.600
something. I didn't believe it the first time I saw it, but this fly is running a stripped-down

29:05.600 --> 29:11.520
ant morphogenetic program on its wings. It's running a virtual ant on its wings, and the idea

29:11.520 --> 29:18.240
is that it wiggles its wings to simulate these ants scurrying about, and that keeps the predators

29:18.240 --> 29:25.120
away because they don't want to deal with ants. And this is amazing, of course, and it's striking

29:25.120 --> 29:30.240
that it has this pattern, but it's no more striking than the much more intricate pattern

29:30.240 --> 29:36.560
of the actual fly. I mean, all of these are specific morphogenetic patterns, whether 2D

29:36.560 --> 29:43.760
or 3D, carried out on this kind of hardware. And you might think that the outcomes are pretty

29:43.760 --> 29:49.520
fixed. I mean, here's an acorn, and you know that all the time what these acorns give rise to is

29:49.520 --> 29:56.240
these oak leaves. And you might think that you know what the oak genome actually does. It encodes

29:56.240 --> 30:02.160
this particular shape, but along comes a bioengineer, and this is a non-human bioengineer. This is a

30:02.160 --> 30:10.000
little wasp, and what these wasps do is they provide some signals that prompt the rest of the

30:10.000 --> 30:16.560
tissue to build something like this. They're hacking the morphogenetic competencies of this leaf.

30:16.560 --> 30:21.920
They're not changing the genome, and what they're doing is providing some instructions that cause

30:21.920 --> 30:28.160
the leaf cells to adopt a different set point in anatomical space. Now, would you ever have any idea

30:28.160 --> 30:32.560
looking at these flat green leaves, and how reliable they are? Would you have any idea that

30:32.560 --> 30:37.680
they're capable of building something like this? I mean, we have no idea. So that just reminds us

30:37.680 --> 30:42.960
that this whole notion of developmental constraint is really probably a constraint in our thinking.

30:42.960 --> 30:48.400
It's not a constraint in the biology. The option space for morphogenesis is enormous,

30:48.400 --> 30:53.440
and what we need to do is to discover the prompts, the language that we can use to get

30:53.440 --> 30:57.680
them to build other things, and it clearly doesn't require modifying the hardware.

30:58.480 --> 31:04.960
The genetics of this thing are still completely intact. So now comes kind of the meat of the

31:04.960 --> 31:10.720
talk, which is that if morphogenesis is the behavior of a collective intelligence operating

31:10.720 --> 31:16.960
in anatomical space, that's what I've been getting at for the last few slides, is the idea that

31:18.880 --> 31:24.400
the act of creating complex anatomical shapes is really behavior. It's behavior in an anatomical

31:24.400 --> 31:29.280
space of possibilities, and it's done by a collective intelligence, which just like us,

31:29.280 --> 31:33.120
we're all collective intelligences, but that collective intelligence thinks about shape as

31:33.120 --> 31:37.600
opposed to moving around in 3D space. So now we need to ask, how do we communicate with that

31:37.600 --> 31:42.560
intelligence? I mean, the WASP did it through millions of years of evolution. We would like

31:42.560 --> 31:48.000
to do it faster. And where does it store its memories? These are some things that we've been

31:48.000 --> 31:54.000
looking at. Well, we know that one way to store memories and communicate with a collective

31:54.000 --> 32:00.000
intelligence is through the nervous system. Now, the nervous system does it via computations

32:00.000 --> 32:06.240
in an electrical network, and you can actually try to decode those. This is the work of people

32:06.240 --> 32:10.720
doing a neural decoding to try to read the electrical activity of the brain and to know

32:10.720 --> 32:15.840
what thoughts and preferences and memories and so on the system has. Well, it turns out that

32:16.880 --> 32:22.960
this system, this ability to store memories in an electrical network, to use an electrical

32:22.960 --> 32:28.480
network to integrate information across many, many, many cells, both in space and in time,

32:28.480 --> 32:32.720
is something that evolution discovered a really long time ago. It is way older than nerve and

32:32.720 --> 32:39.680
muscle. Bacterial biofilms were probably the first to do this, so long predating multicellularity.

32:40.880 --> 32:46.640
And what we've done is to develop some of the first tools to read and write the mind of the

32:46.640 --> 32:52.800
collective intelligence of your body. So by taking a lot of the concepts from neuroscientists and

32:52.800 --> 32:58.480
really emphasizing this idea that neuroscience isn't about neurons at all. Neuroscience is really

32:58.480 --> 33:04.720
about scaling of information from tiny competent subunits into much larger coherent cells that

33:04.720 --> 33:09.760
have higher intelligence in other spaces. That's really what this is about. And that doesn't just

33:09.760 --> 33:13.440
work in the brain, that works in your entire body. So the first thing I want to show you is

33:13.440 --> 33:20.000
some of the techniques that can be used. One thing we have is this thing we develop called

33:20.000 --> 33:25.280
voltage sensitive fluorescent dye imaging. And that means that without having to poke the cells

33:25.280 --> 33:30.720
with electrodes, you can get in real time, this is a time lapse of a frog embryo, this is a frog

33:30.720 --> 33:36.720
putting its face together, you can get a map of all the electrical states and thus you can try to

33:36.720 --> 33:42.800
learn to decode what the system is trying to build. What are the computations that they're

33:42.800 --> 33:52.320
doing? We call this the electric face. This is a bioelectric map of the face ectoderm long before

33:52.320 --> 33:56.080
any of these organs actually appear. You can see that cells already know here's where we're

33:56.080 --> 34:00.480
going to place the eye, the left eye actually comes in a little bit later, here's where the

34:00.480 --> 34:04.880
mouth is going to go, here are the placodes. This is you are literally seeing the way you

34:04.880 --> 34:11.040
would with a brain scan, you are literally seeing the content of the collective intelligence of

34:11.040 --> 34:16.720
morphogenesis in the body of these animals. So these are normal patterns, in fact these are

34:16.720 --> 34:22.640
required for normal development as I'll show you momentarily. But here's a pathological pattern,

34:23.280 --> 34:27.760
and this is induced by injecting a human oncogene into these embryos which eventually

34:27.760 --> 34:33.600
will make a tumor. But these tumors have an aberrant bioelectrical profile because what happens,

34:33.600 --> 34:38.160
the first thing that happens with this oncogene is that it causes an electrical disconnection

34:39.200 --> 34:45.360
from cells from their environment. And when cells disconnect, they immediately lose the ability

34:45.360 --> 34:50.720
to remember these large grandiose goals that they were working on, so making complex organs and

34:50.720 --> 34:56.160
fixing defects and so on, they're just amoebas now. That boundary between self and world has now

34:56.160 --> 35:01.760
shrunk, that cognitive lycone where before the goal was the size of an organ or maybe the whole

35:01.760 --> 35:05.840
organism, now it's down to the size of a single cell, and to them the rest of the body is just

35:05.840 --> 35:11.760
an environment now. So this is where you get metastasis and progression because as far as

35:11.760 --> 35:16.320
they're concerned, they're just amoebas living in an environment, and they go where they want and

35:16.320 --> 35:21.280
they reproduce as much as they want. And so once you understand that, you can try for really

35:21.280 --> 35:26.960
interesting cancer therapeutics, which is what we're doing in our lab. Don't try to kill the cells

35:26.960 --> 35:32.400
with toxic chemotherapy. What if we reinflate their sense of self? What if we reconnect them,

35:32.400 --> 35:38.240
forcibly reconnect them to the large electrical network that can remember what a proper organ is?

35:38.240 --> 35:43.600
And so when you do that, so this is the same animal. Here's the oncoprotein has this red

35:43.600 --> 35:47.520
fluorescence on it. You can see it's blazingly strongly expressed. In fact, it's all over the

35:47.520 --> 35:51.760
place, but there's no tumor. And there's no tumor because we co-injected an ion channel

35:51.760 --> 35:57.360
that modulates, it's an RNA that modulates the electrical property of the cell to force them

35:57.360 --> 36:01.200
to remain in connection, despite what the oncogene is saying. And after that, it doesn't

36:01.200 --> 36:05.840
matter that they have this genetic defect, they behave appropriately and they build nice organs

36:05.840 --> 36:12.560
and so on. So that's a story at the level of single cells, how you scale individual cells

36:12.560 --> 36:22.720
into a larger set of goals. But I want to show you something even larger scale than that,

36:22.720 --> 36:30.160
which is we saw in that electric phase, there's a little eye spot which tells the animal that

36:30.240 --> 36:34.800
that's where the eye is going to go. So we can ask a simple question, what happens if you

36:35.840 --> 36:41.360
reproduce that bioelectric pattern somewhere else? Can you tell this group of cells to build

36:41.360 --> 36:45.440
an eye somewhere else? And it turns out you can. Here it is, we injected some potassium

36:45.440 --> 36:50.400
ion channel RNA into a location that normally would make a gut. So here's this is a tadpole,

36:50.400 --> 36:55.680
here's the mouth, here's the eye, here's the gut. And if you tell these cells using an appropriate

36:55.680 --> 37:00.160
voltage signal that, hey, you should be making an eye, boom, that's what they do. And these eyes

37:00.160 --> 37:06.080
have normal lens, right, an optic nerve, all the same stuff. And you might see in your developmental

37:06.080 --> 37:12.400
biology textbook that only cells in the anterior and erected are here are competent to make eye.

37:12.400 --> 37:17.200
So that isn't true, that's only true if you try to prompt them with the so-called master eye gene.

37:17.200 --> 37:21.360
So if you put in PAC-6 the master eye gene, yes, that's true, only these cells can do it.

37:21.440 --> 37:25.920
But again, that limitation of competency isn't in the embryo, that's on us. That's because we

37:25.920 --> 37:29.920
didn't know the community, didn't know the right way to talk to these cells. Once you understand

37:29.920 --> 37:34.480
the bioelectric code, actually it turns out that almost any region in this embryo is competent to

37:34.480 --> 37:40.880
make eye. And if you should happen to only inject a few cells, so here this is a lens sitting out

37:40.880 --> 37:45.520
in the tail of a tadpole somewhere, if you only inject a few cells, these blue cells are the ones

37:45.520 --> 37:49.760
we injected, then they know there's not enough of them to make a good eye, so what do they do? They

37:49.760 --> 37:54.320
recruit a bunch of their neighbors to work with them to make an eye, just like ants and

37:54.320 --> 37:59.600
termites will recruit their buddies to solve a problem. So now you can see that what we're

37:59.600 --> 38:04.240
doing is providing signals. We didn't tell these cells how to build an eye, we didn't say anything

38:04.240 --> 38:08.240
about the stem cells or the gene expression, we have no idea how to build an eye. What we did find

38:08.240 --> 38:12.800
was a message that we can transmit through this bioelectrical interface that says build an eye

38:12.800 --> 38:17.440
here. And once you get the cells by in so that they are convinced that that in fact is what they

38:17.440 --> 38:20.800
should be building, after that you don't need to do anything, they will do what they do best,

38:20.800 --> 38:28.800
they'll build to a morphogenetic spec. We know this, I want to show you, there's just a couple

38:28.800 --> 38:34.560
of things left here, I want to show you another kind of pattern memory in these planaria, so here's

38:34.560 --> 38:42.160
a normal flatworm. These guys, you can cut them into pieces and they will always regenerate correctly,

38:42.160 --> 38:47.920
so every piece normally makes a nice one-headed worm 100% of the time. But there's a bioelectric

38:47.920 --> 38:52.960
pattern there that we were able to read out and then we were able to modify it. And when you

38:52.960 --> 38:58.800
modify that pattern, you make two-headed worms. And when you make these two-headed worms, what

38:58.800 --> 39:04.240
happens is that you have rewritten the memory of what a correct worm is supposed to look like,

39:04.240 --> 39:08.080
so that when these fragments, when these middle fragments go to regenerate, they consult the

39:08.080 --> 39:12.320
pattern to see what what should a normal worm look like, they see that it says two heads,

39:12.320 --> 39:17.200
and they go ahead and they build two heads. These two-headed worms now in plain water,

39:17.200 --> 39:22.880
meaning no more manipulation of any kind, are now forever two-headed. If you keep cutting them,

39:22.880 --> 39:28.320
they will just continue to regenerate as two-headed. We have permanently changed the target morphology,

39:28.320 --> 39:32.800
the pattern to which they regenerate, but we never touch the DNA, there's nothing wrong with the

39:32.800 --> 39:37.200
genetics here. If we were to throw these guys into the Charles River, 100 years later some

39:37.200 --> 39:40.640
scientists would come along, they'd scoop up some single-headed worms and some double-headed

39:40.640 --> 39:45.520
worms, they'd say, oh, cool, a speciation event, let's sequence the genome and see what made the

39:45.520 --> 39:48.640
difference. There's nothing wrong with their genome, that's not where the information is.

39:48.640 --> 39:54.400
And so that's really important to understand that much as we've been learning from computer science

39:54.400 --> 40:01.920
for a really long time now, the hardware, if it's good hardware, does not fully constrain

40:01.920 --> 40:06.320
what the software is able to do. And so this is a kind of pattern memory, it's long-term stable,

40:06.880 --> 40:12.080
it's rewriteable because we can turn these guys back to one-headed, there you can see what these

40:12.080 --> 40:17.120
two-headed guys are doing when they're hanging out. And so the question of how many heads should

40:17.120 --> 40:23.840
a plenarian have is not written in the DNA, what is written in the DNA is the construction of

40:25.120 --> 40:30.560
some biological material that by default will develop a pattern memory that says one head,

40:30.560 --> 40:34.480
so that's what it does by default, very reliably, but you can change it, you can rewrite it.

40:34.480 --> 40:40.400
And the fact that biological tissue is reprogrammable in this way is hugely important for biomedicine

40:40.400 --> 40:44.880
and for other things. And so I hope you're starting to see that all the emphasis on

40:46.800 --> 40:51.760
genetics and on the genome and all that, it's all very important because you have to understand

40:51.760 --> 40:56.720
your hardware, but it's just the beginning. It's the same, the reason that on your laptop,

40:56.720 --> 41:01.040
if you want to switch from Photoshop to Microsoft Word, you don't get out your soldering iron and

41:01.520 --> 41:07.920
start rewiring because it's reprogrammable. Neither does biology. Biology is using an

41:07.920 --> 41:13.680
incredibly reprogrammable medium that solves problems and can be communicated with using

41:13.680 --> 41:19.760
various interfaces, for example, this bioelectrical interface. So we've talked about the reliability

41:19.760 --> 41:24.880
of development and what things do by default. We've talked about various ways to hack, communicate

41:24.880 --> 41:31.440
with and reprogram the collective intelligence of cells so they can build other variants on the

41:31.440 --> 41:36.560
form. But where do these goals actually come from? So when we called up a second head here,

41:36.560 --> 41:40.800
the second head looks just like the first head. Where are these patterns really? If it's not in

41:40.800 --> 41:46.880
the DNA, what's the space of possible patterns? What else can we do? And by the way, I didn't

41:46.880 --> 41:53.440
show you, but we can actually turn these worms into heads of other species, about 100 to 150

41:53.520 --> 41:59.760
million years' distance. So triangular worms become round, become flat, but you can make the

41:59.760 --> 42:04.880
hardware go to other regions of that space that normally belong to other species. But okay,

42:04.880 --> 42:11.520
those are all evolutionarily defined forms. Is that it? Is that where the forms come from? They're

42:11.520 --> 42:20.560
basically selected for and then there's a finite set of forms that can be implemented by the hardware.

42:20.640 --> 42:26.800
Well, we decided to look at this in a synthetic kind of bioengineering way. And what we did was

42:26.800 --> 42:33.120
we took some cells, some skin cells from frog embryos, and we let them kind of reboot their

42:33.120 --> 42:38.880
multicellularity. We took them aside, we liberated them from their normal interactions with other

42:38.880 --> 42:43.120
cells. And what they did, they could have done many things. They could have died, they could have

42:43.120 --> 42:47.360
crawled away from each other, they could have made a flat monolayer like cell culture.

42:47.360 --> 42:50.800
What they did instead is they merged into something we then named xenobots.

42:51.600 --> 42:56.240
Xenobot because Xenopus lavus is the name of the frog, and we think this is a biorebotics platform.

42:56.240 --> 43:00.880
So they start to swim. They have little silly, little hairs that are normally used to distribute

43:00.880 --> 43:05.280
mucus down the side of the frog, but here they row. So these guys are rowing to the left, these

43:05.280 --> 43:09.200
cells are rowing to the right, and as a result, this thing moves forward. They can go in circles

43:09.200 --> 43:13.920
like this, they can kind of patrol back and forth like that. They have various collective behaviors.

43:13.920 --> 43:16.960
These two are sort of dancing around. This one's going on some sort of long journey.

43:17.680 --> 43:22.560
These ones are doing nothing. They have some very rich calcium signaling. You can see that here,

43:22.560 --> 43:27.440
which is usually a sign of some information processing that's going on in these cells.

43:28.720 --> 43:34.000
Here's one that is navigating this maze. So it's going to take this corner without bumping

43:34.000 --> 43:39.600
into the opposite wall. So there it is. And then here spontaneously, for some reason that we don't

43:40.160 --> 43:44.160
know, it turns around and goes back where it came from. It has spontaneous behavior. Again,

43:44.160 --> 43:53.840
remember, this is just skin. These are just epithelial cells. And they have lots of interesting

43:55.120 --> 44:02.000
behaviors that we can talk about. But one of the most amazing things they do is called kinematic

44:02.000 --> 44:06.880
replication. So just imagine, we've made it completely impossible for these things to reproduce

44:06.880 --> 44:10.800
the normal froggy fashion. They don't have any of the reproductive organs, they don't have any of

44:10.800 --> 44:15.600
that. But in this novel configuration, they figured out a way to make copies of themselves. And

44:15.600 --> 44:20.720
here's how they do it. If you provide them with loose skin cells, this loose material, what they

44:20.720 --> 44:27.040
do is they run around and they sort of collect those loose skin cells into little balls like this.

44:27.040 --> 44:31.520
And because what they're working with is an agential material, meaning these are not passive

44:31.520 --> 44:36.480
pellets, these are cells, for the same reason that we were able to make xenobots, they make the

44:36.480 --> 44:41.040
second generation of xenobots. And these little balls that they make mature, and guess what they

44:41.040 --> 44:45.840
do? They run around and make the next generation of xenobots and so on. And this is kinematic

44:45.840 --> 44:51.120
replication. It's kind of von Neumann's dream of a robot that went around and made copies of

44:51.120 --> 44:55.360
itself from materials it finds in the environment. I mean, just think this, there's never been any

44:55.360 --> 45:01.360
xenobots. There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot. This is not in the lineage of frogs.

45:02.320 --> 45:08.000
Where does this come from? Their shape, their behaviors, the kinematic self-replication, all

45:08.000 --> 45:13.520
the other things they can do. Where does that come from? It's very hard to say that this was the

45:13.520 --> 45:20.000
subject of selection. So again, I come back to this theme that while the hardware was absolutely

45:20.000 --> 45:25.520
selected for, I don't think it was selected to make frogs. I don't think that what evolution does is

45:25.520 --> 45:30.880
create solutions for specific problems or things that are fit in a specific environment.

45:30.880 --> 45:36.720
I think what evolution does is make creative problem-solving agents that they'll do the same

45:36.720 --> 45:42.000
thing under default conditions, but once you start making changes and challenging them,

45:42.000 --> 45:50.080
they often rise to the occasion and solve problems in very novel ways that reflect dynamics that

45:50.080 --> 45:58.480
they've not seen before. And lest you think this is some trick of, you know, unique to frogs or

45:58.480 --> 46:04.480
embryos, I mean, when we first published all this stuff, some people said, well, frogs, amphibians

46:04.480 --> 46:09.680
are pretty plastic and embryos are especially plastic. So maybe this is some kind of a specific

46:09.680 --> 46:18.800
thing in frog embryology. So the last thing I want to show you is this. So here's this little guy

46:18.800 --> 46:23.040
running around and I will ask you what this is. And you might think that this is something I got

46:23.040 --> 46:27.520
off the bottom of a pond somewhere, right, some sort of primitive organism. And then I can tell

46:27.520 --> 46:33.120
you that, well, we've sequenced its genome and you'll say, oh, what's the genome? What does it

46:33.120 --> 46:38.080
look like? And I'll say, well, this is 100% Homo sapiens. These are adult human cells. There's no

46:38.080 --> 46:45.200
embryonics here. This is adult tracheal cells taken from human donors. Most of them elderly in

46:45.200 --> 46:53.200
their 70s and 80s. And when given the chance, they reboot themselves and have a new life as these

46:53.200 --> 46:58.480
things. We call them anthropots for obvious reasons. And they have all kinds of novel shapes

46:58.480 --> 47:07.520
and behaviors. I call this kind of a technology for personalized agential interventions because

47:07.520 --> 47:14.160
if you ask, what can these things do? Well, one thing they can do is this. If you take human neurons

47:14.160 --> 47:18.960
and plate them on a dish and put a big scratch through them, these anthropots can settle down.

47:18.960 --> 47:25.120
We call this a super bot because there's probably 10 of them here. They'll settle down and within a

47:25.120 --> 47:29.520
few days you lift them up and you see that what they did was they took the two sides of the wound

47:29.520 --> 47:34.320
and they knitted the nerves together. So they have the ability to repair these kind of neural

47:34.320 --> 47:38.320
wounds. I mean, who would have thought that your tracheal cells, which normally sit quietly in your

47:38.320 --> 47:44.320
airway for decades, that given the opportunity taken out of the body, they would actually

47:44.320 --> 47:51.520
reassemble themselves into a new kind of creature with these new capacities. And so this is, I think,

47:51.520 --> 47:56.160
hugely important for the future of medicine because just imagine, once we understand what

47:56.160 --> 48:00.720
kind of healing effects these guys can have, they can be injected into your body. They do not

48:00.720 --> 48:05.440
require immune suppression because they're made of your own cells. So personalized medicine in

48:05.440 --> 48:11.040
that way. They share with your body all the priors about what health is, what diseases,

48:11.040 --> 48:16.720
inflammation, cancer. You don't have to build all those detectors from scratch like you would with

48:16.720 --> 48:22.240
some sort of engineered nanobot because these are your own cells. They already understand all those

48:22.240 --> 48:29.280
things. And so again, you start to see this plasticity. Again, what you just saw is not

48:29.280 --> 48:34.640
some embryonic developmental stage that they're recovering back in their history. There is no

48:34.640 --> 48:41.040
such stage. This is completely novel set of behaviors. And so now I'm going to finish up here

48:41.040 --> 48:46.640
with kind of some big picture thinking here. What I've been telling you about all of these stories

48:46.640 --> 48:51.520
and all of their kind of biomedical implications for cancer and birth defects and regenerative medicine,

48:52.320 --> 48:58.480
there's a bigger picture here, which is that what we're talking about is an example of how to

48:58.480 --> 49:03.120
recognize and how to communicate with an unconventional intelligence. It is not just

49:03.120 --> 49:09.920
philosophy that thinking about groups of cells as decision making, memory having goal directed

49:09.920 --> 49:15.360
beings has led us to lots of discoveries that were not made by the standard paradigm, which sees them

49:15.360 --> 49:21.280
as simple machines. So my point is that along this spectrum, I call this the spectrum of

49:21.280 --> 49:26.240
persuadability because it's all about what kind of tools you're going to use to communicate

49:26.240 --> 49:31.680
and control these various systems. So here it's hardware rewiring and maybe some control theory

49:31.760 --> 49:37.520
and cybernetics with things like thermostats. And then here maybe behavioral science and training

49:37.520 --> 49:42.320
and things like that. And then here you have some sort of rich relationship with cogent reasoning

49:42.320 --> 49:49.040
and so on. The idea is that we can't just have philosophical feelings about where things fit

49:49.040 --> 49:53.840
on this continuum. Most people assume that cells are somewhere down here, that they're basically

49:53.840 --> 50:00.080
simple machines that need to be treated that way. And that leaves a lot on the table because we're

50:00.080 --> 50:05.840
doing all kinds of interesting things with cell training and really taking advantage of the problem

50:05.840 --> 50:10.640
solving competencies of these things. And so we have to do experiments. And so that brings us back

50:10.640 --> 50:18.160
to the issue of AI because the question of AI isn't about today's language models. Today,

50:18.160 --> 50:25.040
it's pretty easy to say, well, GPT-4 isn't really like a human mind and so on. No, it isn't. And it

50:25.040 --> 50:29.520
doesn't matter for two reasons. First, because there are many interesting minds that are not human

50:29.520 --> 50:38.000
minds and some of them are quite alien. And second, because the whole point is that you

50:38.000 --> 50:41.040
can't just assume these things. You have to do experiments. You have to ask yourself,

50:41.920 --> 50:46.960
do I know where intelligence comes from? Why do simple things? And we've studied some very

50:46.960 --> 50:52.400
simple things that have amazing, unexpected, emergent, intelligent behaviors. Do we know

50:52.400 --> 50:56.240
where that comes from and how to recognize them? And I'll tell you that at this moment we don't.

50:56.240 --> 51:01.120
So this is the science of diverse intelligence. And we need to be extremely careful. And I think

51:01.120 --> 51:08.400
this is where the ethics comes in. We need to be extremely careful about not denying moral

51:08.400 --> 51:13.600
worth and various kinds of ethical protections to beings because they don't look like us.

51:14.560 --> 51:20.800
Humans have a very long history of trying to make separations between in-group and out-group

51:20.800 --> 51:34.480
based on really pretty ridiculous, very surfacing characteristics. And in your lifetime, you are

51:34.480 --> 51:41.200
going to be confronted with all sorts of novel beings. So all of Darwin's endless forms, most

51:41.200 --> 51:46.720
beautiful here on Earth, are like a tiny corner of this whole space. You know, hybrids and cyborgs

51:46.720 --> 51:52.720
and all kinds of non-neurotypical humans with implants and different kinds of connections to

51:52.720 --> 51:59.200
other creatures and to other technical systems. You know, pretty much any combination of evolved

51:59.200 --> 52:04.080
material, engineered material and software is some kind of being. Okay, there are going to be

52:04.800 --> 52:10.400
chimeras and cyborgs. And so it's not about the language models of today. It's about beings that

52:10.400 --> 52:15.440
are nowhere with you on the tree of life. You cannot decide how you're going to relate to them

52:15.520 --> 52:19.360
in the old ways, which was to, you know, sort of knock on it. And if you hear a metallic clanging

52:19.360 --> 52:23.520
sound, you say, aha, so you were made in the factory and you're boring and I can take you

52:23.520 --> 52:29.680
apart. And that's okay. Whereas if you heard like this soft, woolly thud, you would say,

52:29.680 --> 52:35.040
ah, well, you're a real being like me and I have to treat you well, even though we're not even very

52:35.040 --> 52:41.040
good at that as humans. But the point is that those kinds of categories are going to be worthless

52:41.040 --> 52:46.800
because the space of possible bodies and minds is extending radically. And we're going to have to

52:46.800 --> 52:51.760
develop much better ethical frameworks for kind of, you know, I'm sure you've heard of symbiosis,

52:51.760 --> 52:56.400
I think what we're really talking about is a kind of synthbiosis, where we have to learn how to

52:56.400 --> 53:02.160
relate to beings that are different than us. And that, you know, we're going to have to figure

53:02.160 --> 53:07.840
out how you how you detect where things are on this continuum, so that we find appropriate balance

53:07.840 --> 53:12.080
points between objectophilia. Objectophilia is the thing where people fall in love with bridges

53:12.080 --> 53:16.880
and, you know, they think the Eiffel Tower is, you know, married to them and so on. Right. So,

53:16.880 --> 53:20.800
things down here, you're not going to have that deep relationship with things up here,

53:20.800 --> 53:24.880
but other people are really trapped in the other end of the continuum where they see things that

53:24.880 --> 53:31.920
are not like today's standard humans. And they say, you know, those are not real minds worthy of

53:32.000 --> 53:38.080
care and respect and so on. And that very quickly devolves to a kind of idea that's basically

53:38.080 --> 53:43.760
love only your own kind. And I think that's that's that's probably lots much worse than this.

53:43.760 --> 53:48.480
So, we really need to, and if anybody has questions we can talk about it, we really need to ask,

53:48.480 --> 53:54.640
you know, given all of these facts, what are what is a human actually? And I have a kind of a weird

53:55.360 --> 54:01.040
answer to that. And if you were going on on a long journey and you wanted a companion,

54:01.040 --> 54:04.560
what is it that you actually care about? You know, when you say, you know, you don't want a

54:04.560 --> 54:09.040
Roomba, that's that's not enough. But what do you actually care about? It's not the DNA. It's I

54:09.040 --> 54:13.440
don't think anybody has any allegiance to our particular human DNA or the specific set of

54:13.440 --> 54:17.920
organs. What is it that you do want, you know, in a rich human level relationship? That's that's

54:17.920 --> 54:21.920
very worth thinking about. So, okay, so I'm going to I'm going to stop here. I'm anybody who's

54:21.920 --> 54:26.320
interested in this stuff. Here's a bunch of papers that go into all of this in great detail.

54:26.960 --> 54:31.520
Most importantly, I need to thank all the people who did the work that I showed you today. So,

54:32.560 --> 54:37.520
here are all the all the postdocs and students and everybody else who who contributed. We

54:37.520 --> 54:42.400
have lots of amazing collaborators. Our funding comes from all kinds of people have to do a

54:42.400 --> 54:47.040
disclosure here because there are three companies that have spun out of our lab that are supporting

54:47.040 --> 54:51.760
some of our work. So there's some business connections here. But most of all, I always

54:51.760 --> 54:56.960
thank the model system because because the various animals and plants do all of the

54:56.960 --> 55:01.520
heavy lifting in teaching us about biology and about ourselves. So thank you so much. I'll take

55:01.520 --> 55:08.560
questions.
