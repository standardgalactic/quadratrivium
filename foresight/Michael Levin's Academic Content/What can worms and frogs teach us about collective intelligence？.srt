1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,600
Thank you so much. That's very kind. And it's been a real honor and a privilege to get to

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,760
know Bill and work together on these projects. So thank you for inviting me here. This is

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,960
a new kind of audience for me. And I've put together a talk that I haven't given before.

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,720
So let's see how it goes. By the way, if anybody's interested afterwards in the details, all

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,080
of the sort of official peer-reviewed kind of stuff, the software, the papers, everything is

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,400
here. And then here are sort of a little bit more personal thoughts about what I think it all means

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,040
and things like that. So let's begin here. This is a well-known painting. It's called Adam Names

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,480
the Animals in the Garden of Eden. And there are two interesting things about this old story.

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,880
One of them, I think, is needs to really be redone and ditched. And the other one is very

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,320
profound. And I think it's going to be important for us going forward. The one that needs to be

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,320
dropped is this idea here that there are discrete natural kinds of beings. We know what they are.

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:14,120
Here are these large, mostly cute sorts of animals. There's Adam. We know what they are.

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,040
They're discrete. They're different from each other. Adam, of course, is different from all of

14
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,320
them. And that, as you're going to see in a minute, does not do justice to the incredible plasticity

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,280
of life. Our attempts to bin it into these categories is not going to fly. What is really

16
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,440
profound here, I think, is that in that original story, you may or may not know that neither God

17
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,000
nor the angels were able to name the animals. It was Adam that had to do it. The job was on him.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,360
And there are a couple of reasons why that might be. One is because in these old traditions,

19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,720
naming something or discovering the name of something means you've discovered something about

20
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,560
its true inner nature. And I think that's important because we, as humans, are going to have to

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,480
discover the inner nature of a very wide set of beings that Adam could not even have begun to dream

22
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,200
of. The other thing is, of course, Adam's the one that has to live with them. And so his understanding

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,800
of his world and the other beings around it is going to be critical for him to develop. So I

24
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,160
want to talk about a few things today. First is some thoughts on information, evolution, and

25
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,200
selves, this notion of collective intelligence and where it comes from. I want to talk about the

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,040
paradox of change and how biology handles it. Now, the paradox of change can be said as follows.

27
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,320
This is scaled to the level of evolution, but I think you will see the obvious implications for

28
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:41,600
personal and possibly company growth and things like that. The paradox is this, if you're a species

29
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,000
and you fail to change, you're going to go extinct. But if you do change, you likewise will, in an

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
important sense, cease to exist. So what does that mean? How do we, as beings, preserve ourselves in

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,640
some sense as we inevitably change? We change physically, we change mentally. If you don't

32
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,720
change mentally, you can't learn. So there's some sense in which profound educational process changes

33
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,200
you so that you're not the same, certainly growing up, but we'll do that and so on. So this is a

34
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,640
really interesting paradox and I'm going to show you how I think biology handles it. And we're

35
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:21,920
going to talk about a few other topics such as plasticity, diverse intelligence, and creative

36
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,880
interpretation, a.k.a. polycomputing that biology uses across scales. And we're going to look at it,

37
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,320
we're going to start our journey here through the eyes of a frog with an eye on its butt. Now,

38
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,400
if anybody asks you in the future, have you ever seen a frog with an eye on its butt, now you can

39
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,080
say yes. This is a frog we have made in our lab. This is not Photoshop. This is not AI. This is

40
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,200
a real eye on its butt. And the reason that these kinds of things are possible is because

41
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:56,000
biology commits to a certain kind of creative process to solve this problem. The way the way

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,120
that frog came to be is that we took a tadpole. So here's a tadpole, here's the brain, the nostrils,

43
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,760
the mouth, the gut, the tail. And what we did was we put some eyes, some eye cell precursor cells

44
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,120
on the back of this tadpole. The cells go ahead and they make an eye. I'll tell you another story

45
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,240
about ectopic eyes in a minute, but that's how we did this is by transplantation. You'll also

46
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,800
note that he doesn't have any primary eyes. So we prevented those from forming, but we put an eye on

47
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,480
his tail. And then we built this machine. This was an incredible ordeal. It took probably five

48
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,400
years, about a million bucks, which is huge for a lab, to build this kind of thing. And what the

49
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,080
machine does is test these tadpoles in visual assays. So basically, there's a little spot of

50
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,880
light and they have to either chase or stay away from the moving light in order to succeed in that

51
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,120
task. And we found out that they can see quite well. These eyes on their backs enable them to

52
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,520
see perfectly well. By the way, here's the optic nerve. You can trace it. It does not go to the

53
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,720
brain. It goes to the spinal cord and then it stops there. So notice what's happened here is that

54
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,920
this animal has a radically different sensory motor architecture. You've got now this weird itchy

55
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,400
patch of tissue on your back that's sending signals to your spinal cord. How does the brain know that

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,400
that's visual data and use it? And in particular, why doesn't that take extra evolutionary cycles?

57
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,280
You know, cycles of mutation, selection, it's just ready to roll. You've drastically changed

58
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,760
this architecture that's been the same for millions of years and suddenly it works. And it

59
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,360
works because evolution doesn't actually make specific solutions to specific problems. It makes

60
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,680
problem-solving agents. And embryos, as I'll point out in a few minutes, can't take much for

61
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,360
granted. They solve these things on the fly, which is why this works. Now, what this has to do with

62
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:54,160
collective intelligence is this. We all started life right here as a single cell. I once pointed

63
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,160
out to somebody, I was doing some expert witness work and they were trying to, one of the attorneys

64
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,160
was trying to say that our work in frog was not relevant to humans. And he said, don't frogs come

65
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,400
from an egg? I said, will you come from an egg? And this was like everybody thought I was insulting

66
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,120
him, you know, the judge bang the thing. But let's remember, we all come from an egg. We all come

67
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,960
from a single cell. And that's a little blob of chemistry and physics. And that slowly and gradually

68
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,640
gives rise to one of these remarkable morphologies. And there is no magic spot, no lightning flash

69
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,520
that says, okay, you wore physics, but now you're a real cognitive individual. Now, mind comes into

70
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,080
the picture. This is slow and gradual. So we, then as scientists and philosophers, do need to understand

71
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,080
how does that scaling work? How do you get from a system that's well-described by chemistry and

72
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,480
physics? And as I'll mention, actually, not with zero cognitive capacity, it's small, but it's not

73
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:57,680
zero. How do you get here? And let's remember that we humans with our magical, agential glow

74
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,280
are not discreetly different from all of these other things. We stand at the intersection of two

75
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:10,480
enormous continuums where you can both, both evolutionarily and developmentally. And then,

76
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,560
you know, through biological change and through technological change, there are all kinds of

77
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,880
interesting beings that we're going to need to get to know. So that's a little disturbing. And a lot

78
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,440
of people, a lot of people, they send me emails about how disturbed they are to find out that

79
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,880
they were basically a scale up from a single cell. But at least we're a true unified intelligence,

80
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,920
right? So like we're not like a collection of ants or termites or something that you can talk

81
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,320
about an ant colony as a collective intelligence, but we're an actual true unified intelligence,

82
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:47,680
right? Well, wrong. So this is Descartes, who really liked the pineal gland. And the reason

83
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,760
he liked the pineal gland is that there's only one of them in the brain. And he felt that our

84
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,200
unified human experience should be associated with a structure in the brain. That's unique, not

85
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,840
bifurcated, not to like the hemispheres or all these other structures. It should be the only one.

86
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,960
Well, if he had had access to good microscopy, he would have looked inside the pineal gland and

87
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,640
you would have seen that, wait a minute, there's not one of anything. It's made of a bunch of cells.

88
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,680
Each one of these cells has all this stuff in it. So look at this. These are all the things that are

89
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,800
inside of each cell. And there's plenty more. This is only what we know to stain at this point.

90
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,280
And so all intelligence is collective intelligence. We are all built of a kind of multi-scale

91
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,240
agential material. This is a single cell. This happens to be a free living organism known as

92
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,880
a lacrimaria. But look, this is what a single cell can do. There's no brain. There's no nervous

93
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:44,240
system. He's handling all of his local needs with, and this is real time. So incredible anatomical,

94
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:52,480
physiological, and metabolic control and so on. And so we're all made of collections of these.

95
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
And the thing about being a collective intelligence is that you need cognitive glue.

96
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,920
Now what I mean by that is, here's a rat that's been trained to press a lever, get a reward.

97
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,400
There is no single cell here that has had both experiences. So the cells at the bottom of the

98
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,080
feet interacted with the lever. The cells in the gut got the delicious sugar reward. But no single

99
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,200
cell had both of these experiences. So who owns the associative memory? Who is it that knows that

100
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,120
these two things are tied? It isn't any individual cell. It is the rat. So you've got this. You've

101
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:30,720
got what you need is a set of mechanisms that are able to provide the system with memories,

102
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,440
preferences, goals, and other cognitive properties that the individual parts don't have.

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,320
Now we're used to thinking about ones like this, and creatures like this are fairly,

104
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,120
the rat doesn't change too much, but there are many other creatures that show us something

105
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:56,320
really remarkable. So here are some flatworms, some plenarium. You can train them to understand

106
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,120
that these little bumpy circles that we've laser etched into the bottom of the dish are where they

107
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,160
get fed. So the liver shows up on these little circles. The other amazing thing about plenaria

108
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,520
is that they regenerate. So you can cut them into pieces. The record is something like 276 pieces,

109
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,960
and if you cut them in half here, this tail will sit there doing nothing for about eight days. It'll

110
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,600
grow a new head, and then behavior begins, and you find out that these animals remember the

111
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,800
original information. So the information is not exclusively in the brain because you can cut off

112
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:34,320
the entire head. It is somewhere else. However, it is imprinted onto the new brain as it develops.

113
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,960
And so you can do all kinds of interesting thought experiments, like the old malfunctioning

114
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,280
transporter, and ask, okay, if we cut them into pieces, who's the original plenaria, and so on.

115
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,640
So right away you get into these issues of personal identity. You get into where is behavioral

116
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,360
information? How does it move through the body? How does it imprint it onto new brains? How do

117
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,000
brains know how to interpret? Just like I showed you in the tadpole, the brain knows how to interpret

118
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,440
information coming off of its spinal cord. How does this brain know that whatever the tail is

119
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,040
telling it is actually behavioral information that the brain can use? But it goes even beyond that.

120
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,280
It's not just about maintaining the information. Here's one of my favorite examples. So here's

121
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,920
a caterpillar, two-dimensional. You can model it as a soft-bodied robot with a particular

122
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,360
controller, and that's suitable for moving soft bodies that have no hard elements, so you can't

123
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,760
push on anything. So these things crawl around and they eat leaves, and they have a brain that's

124
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,960
well suited for that. They have to turn into this. This is a butterfly that flies in three-dimensional

125
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,640
space, doesn't eat leaves, it drinks nectar. And in order to change the brain from this to that,

126
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,840
you basically undergo this remarkable transformation process that dissolves most of the brain.

127
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,000
Many of the cells die, most of the connections are broken, but what you find out is that if you

128
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,560
train the caterpillar to seek out leaves on a particular color disc, the butterfly will do

129
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,640
the same. Now there's a few amazing things here. You can ask questions like, what's it like to be

130
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,800
a creature in the process of changing so radically? Questions like that, and you can ask where is

131
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,800
the memory? If the brain is being refactored, where does it keep those memories? But there's a

132
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:18,160
deeper issue here, which is that butterflies don't eat the same stuff that caterpillars eat,

133
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,760
and they don't move the same way the caterpillars move. So having the exact memories of a caterpillar

134
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,920
is completely useless. What it has to do actually is interpret whatever the engrams, whatever the

135
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:37,040
memory traces that the caterpillar leaves, it has to reinterpret them for its new context. So in its

136
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,480
new higher dimensional life, it doesn't carry the exact memories of its previous life, but it

137
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,360
carries the deep lessons that it's learned. And the trick here is that it has to know how to

138
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,080
remap them onto its own architecture. So you can read a lot more about this in this preprint

139
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:01,520
that I just put up a few days ago. So the interesting thing is that these worms and

140
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,880
caterpillars and so on, we shouldn't just think about them as this sort of bizarre

141
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,000
aspect of biology that has nothing to do with us. Because if you think about the slices of

142
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,440
our own life at any given moment, you don't have access to the past. The only thing you have access

143
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,080
to are the engrams, the traces of past experience that your past self has laid down in your brain,

144
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:32,560
in your body, in notepads, in various outsourced kinds of things. You have to reinterpret those

145
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,240
memories at every point. You have to reconstruct actively the story of who you are, what you are,

146
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:45,200
what your various commitments and beliefs are from the molecules and the energy patterns that are

147
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,600
in your body. And you have to tell a story about what they add up to. This is what our brain does

148
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,960
all the time. One way to think about this is that memories are messages from your past self.

149
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,240
Just the way that you exchange messages laterally with other beings at your current

150
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,880
time point. These memories are messages from a past self. And like any act of communication,

151
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,840
you're not actually required to interpret these messages in the way that the sender intended.

152
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,800
You are free to reinterpret them, however it's best for you. And not only are you free to do that,

153
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,880
you actually have to do that because you will change. Your body will change, the environment

154
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,280
changes. Even for humans, there's turnover. There's molecular turnover and cellular turnover

155
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,480
all the time. So all of these messages have to be turned over. And the way that this works,

156
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:41,440
you can imagine that these engrams, these memory traces are like this middle node, this narrow

157
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,600
little middle node in what this is probably familiar to many of you, this kind of

158
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:53,680
this architecture that's used like an autoencoder kind of thing where it squeezes down

159
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,880
all of the information that's come before because you don't want it to remember the exact data.

160
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,280
You want it to remember patterns. And then you pass the bottleneck, you want this side to

161
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:09,040
reinflate those patterns into whatever makes sense on the other end. Biology has this everywhere in

162
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,000
gene regulatory networks and voltage at the center of bioelectrical circuits in biomechanical

163
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,760
networks. This architecture is absolutely everywhere because this is what enables information to

164
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,600
preserve salience, not accuracy, but salience and utility on the other end. Now this will only work

165
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:35,360
if the two ends of this thing are smart. They have to undertake some effort to interpret

166
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:43,120
and encode what's going on here. So our bodies are made of a multi-scale competency architecture.

167
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,680
Every level of this is in fact smart in the sense that it has a competency to solve various problems.

168
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,960
So whole bodies of course solve problems in three-dimensional space, various kinds of behaviors,

169
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:01,920
but your molecular networks, your subcellular organelles, your cellular components, your organs,

170
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,040
tissues, all of these things solve problems in other kinds of spaces. And in fact, one thing

171
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:14,240
that evolution has done is to pivot some of the same tools and tricks for navigating problem spaces

172
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,480
across these various spaces. So we started off metabolic space and then physiological space and

173
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,120
then genes came along and you could navigate gene expression space and then multicellularity came

174
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,040
along and you could navigate anatomical space, the space of possible large-scale shapes. And then,

175
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,960
of course, brains and muscles showed up and you could do behavioral space and then eventually

176
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,680
linguistic space. And it turns out from some recent work in our group that actually some of

177
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,720
the exact same ideas from navigating these other spaces you can use to help AIs navigate linguistic

178
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:52,480
space and keep track of a story longer and longer and so on. So Alan Turing, who obviously needs

179
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,800
no introduction, who was very interested in minds and intelligence and different embodiments of

180
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,480
intelligence and machines and so on, he was studying intelligence through reprogrammability,

181
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,200
right? He was interested in programmable hardware and plasticity. Interestingly,

182
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,280
he wrote this paper, The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis. It's one of the earliest works on

183
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,800
the mathematics of how order might arise in chemical systems like that egg that I showed you.

184
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:27,120
So he was interested how do you, how does the egg self-assemble? How do the chemicals assume

185
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,760
some sort of order? Now, why would somebody who was interested in mathematics and computer science

186
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,760
and so on be interested in this question? And I think that he saw a very profound kind of

187
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,360
invariance that I think if he had lived longer, both biology and computer science would be much

188
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:50,080
further along because what he realized was that the story of the appearance of minds is fundamentally

189
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,440
the same story as the story of the self-assembly of the body, right? The factors that put together

190
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,400
your body should be really important for understanding where minds come from. So let's

191
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,600
ask where do anatomies come from? So you start life as a collection of embryonic blastomeres.

192
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,240
This is a cross-section through an adult human. Look at the amazing order. All of the organs,

193
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,920
they're the right size, the right shape. Everything is next to the correct thing.

194
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,880
Where does this amazing order come from? Where is this pattern written down? And so if you ask,

195
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,520
even nine-year-olds, I've given talks to middle schools and they will immediately say, well,

196
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,320
it's in the DNA. It's in the genome. But the thing is that we can read genomes now. And actually,

197
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,880
this was apparent long before, but now we know for sure because we can read genomes. None of this

198
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,360
is directly in the genome. What's in the genome are the specifications of the proteins, the tiniest

199
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,800
hardware, the molecular hardware that cells get to have. This pattern, any more than the actual

200
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,560
structure of the termite colony or the precise pattern of a spider web are not in their genome.

201
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,800
This is not directly in our genome either. Where this comes from is the working out of

202
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:03,280
the physiological software that this hardware enables. And so we have to ask a number of questions.

203
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,400
Given that DNA specifies the hardware, where does the anatomy come from? How do cells know

204
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,120
what to make and when to stop? If a piece is missing, people like us want to know how do you

205
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,760
repair it? How do you convince them to regrow what they need to regrow? And as engineers,

206
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,440
we also ask, well, what else are they willing to do if we knew how to communicate with them?

207
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,800
And I could do a whole thing here on the anatomical compiler and some of those ideas.

208
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,280
But if we knew how to communicate with these cells, what else would they be willing to build?

209
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,840
And I'm going to show you some of those towards the end of the talk.

210
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,040
Now, one cool thing about this process is that it's not hardwired. This is not simply the emergence

211
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,480
of complexity. This is actually the emergence of intelligence. What kind of intelligence? Well,

212
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,600
goal-directedness of a certain kind in anatomical space. So here, this is an amazing creature,

213
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,760
this axolotl. And they regenerate their limbs, their eyes, their jaws, portions of the brain

214
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,760
and heart and so on. And if they lose a limb, and they do this all the time, they bite each other's

215
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,600
legs off constantly, wherever they lose the limb, the cells will work very hard to build exactly

216
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,440
what's needed, and then they stop. And that's the most amazing thing about this process is they

217
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,960
know when to stop. How do they know when to stop? Well, they stop when the correct axolotl arm has

218
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,840
been completed. It's a process of anatomical homeostasis. If you deviate them from their goal,

219
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,920
they will get right back there and then they stop. By the way, this is not just for weird organisms.

220
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,320
Mammals are a little bit regenerative, so humans can regenerate their liver.

221
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,680
Kids up to a certain age can regenerate their fingertips. And deer can regenerate bone

222
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,560
and vasculature and innervation up to a centimeter and a half per day of new growth when they're

223
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,960
doing this. So we have some of these capacities, but not terribly much. And I want to show you

224
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,360
one of my favorite examples of this kind of intelligence and what it means to be a being

225
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,920
coming into this world. This is a cross-section through a kidney tubule in the in the in the

226
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:08,240
nude. So normally it's made of eight to ten cells or so. But one trick you can do is by

227
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,640
increasing the number of nuclei of actually genetic material in these cells, you can make

228
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,000
the cells much larger. So the cells will scale to the amount of genetic material,

229
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,520
but the nude stays the same size. And the only way you can do that is by using fewer cells to

230
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,520
build the same structure. And so the first amazing thing is that you could have extra copies of all

231
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,360
your genetic material. No problems. Everything still works. Second, you can have huge cells,

232
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,080
and you will scale the number appropriately. No problem. The most amazing thing happens when

233
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,200
you make truly enormous cells. And at that point, one cell will just bend around itself and give you

234
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,680
that same lumen. Now this is a completely different molecular mechanism than this. This is cell to

235
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:55,120
cell communication. This is cytoskeletal bending. So this is top-down causation. In the service of a

236
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,640
particular journey and anatomical space that that this system needs to make, it can use different

237
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,680
tools in its disposal. It can use different molecular tools to get the job done. And we can ask all

238
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,440
kinds of interesting questions about how did it know that that was the thing to do? But just think

239
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,720
about what it means to be a nude coming into this world. You can't depend on anything. Never mind the

240
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,760
environment. Never mind the injury that somebody else might come along and bite your leg off or

241
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,040
something. You can't even count on your own parts. You don't know how many copies of your chromosomes

242
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,400
you're going to have. You don't know what the size of your cells are going to be. You don't know how

243
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,600
many cells you're going to have. You have to come in and on the fly, you have to take this journey

244
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,360
in anatomical space, and you can't overtrain on your evolutionary priors. You cannot assume any of

245
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,080
the things that were true in evolution going back. Not just about the environment, but about

246
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,640
yourself. So a very long story, very short. We've been studying how all these things work, and what

247
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,120
we basically found out is that the capacities of brains and nervous systems for dealing with novelty,

248
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,480
for intelligence, for navigation, for keeping memories and pursuing goals and all of that,

249
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,680
those capacities are actually incredibly ancient. They're driven by a kind of

250
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,680
electrophysiological software that is produced in the brain by these little ion channels

251
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,080
that set voltages, and these voltages can propagate through the network, and you get

252
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,800
this electrical activity that you can imagine going on in the brain. But that mechanism is

253
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,840
extremely ancient. It's not really specific to brains at all. Evolution discovered it about

254
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,920
the time of bacterial biofilm, so very long ago. And all cells have these ion channels,

255
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,720
most cells have these electrical synapses. Your whole body is a giant electrical network

256
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,840
that has many of the capacities that your brain has, but it does them slower. So if you take almost

257
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,800
any neuroscience paper, and you just do a find, replace, and in fact, we made an AI system to

258
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,440
do just this for people, it basically flips some words around, you know, if instead of neuron,

259
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,000
you say cell, and instead of millisecond, you say hour, you basically get a pretty reasonable

260
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,520
developmental biology paper about how, whereas your brain thinks about moving you in three

261
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,320
dimensional and now linguistic space, the rest of your body has been thinking about how to move

262
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,040
you through anatomical space from being an egg to being, you know, whatever, whatever we become.

263
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,320
So I just want to show you a small piece of what happens when we understand something like this.

264
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,280
This is, this, these electrical networks are literally the cognitive medium of the

265
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,840
collective intelligence of your body cells, whereas you are the product of the collective

266
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,160
intelligence of your neurons, your body is the product of the collective intelligence of the

267
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,440
rest of your cells behaving in anatomical space. And when we learn this interface,

268
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,920
this bioelectrical interface, we get access to an API that's very, very powerful. Here's one

269
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,400
example. And by the way, just to say none of this has to do with applied electric fields,

270
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,280
there are no electrodes, no magnets, no waves or frequencies or anything like that. We're hacking

271
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,080
the natural interface that cells use to shape each other's behavior, which is the set of ion

272
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:07,440
channels and gap junctions on their surface. And so, so we can, we can, for example, insert

273
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,320
some, some potassium channel proteins here to create a particular voltage pattern. And that

274
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,800
voltage pattern is a signal to these cells. And what these cells will do is build an eye. This

275
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,040
is not like the eye I showed you before, that was a transplant. This is not like that. We have said

276
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,600
to these cells, which normally make a gut, we've said, here's a particular voltage pattern. It's,

277
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,680
it happens to be the same pattern that they normally use to make an eye. And the cells see it,

278
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,760
and they build an eye. Okay. And these eyes, if you section them, have the same lens, retina,

279
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,520
optic nerve, all this stuff. Now notice a couple of interesting things. First of all,

280
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,920
like any good subroutine call, we did not have to give it all the information on how to build an

281
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,360
eye. In fact, we don't have any idea of how to build an eye. We don't know how to talk to all the

282
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,800
stem cells, all the genes that are there that have to be turned on eyes very complex. And we don't

283
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:57,920
want to, we want a high level stimulus that prompts the cells to do what they already know

284
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,960
how to do. So that's the first thing. The second thing is, here, this is, this is a lens sitting

285
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,440
out in the flank of a tadpole somewhere. The blue cells are the ones that we actually injected

286
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,840
with our ion channel, but there's not enough of them to make an eye. And so what they've done is

287
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,880
they've recruited all these other normal cells to participate with them to be an eye. And in fact,

288
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,400
we've studied, there's a conversation that happens, these blue cells acquire a new belief. They believe

289
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,400
that they should be an eye and they tell all the other cells, hey, you should be working with us

290
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,880
to make an eye. These other cells, actually, what are they saying? They're saying, no, we should be

291
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,640
skin or gut or whatever. And so they have this back and forth conversation. And sometimes these guys

292
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,160
win and you get an eye. And sometimes the rest of the cells win and they ignore us and stay whatever

293
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,120
tissue they're supposed to be. There are other collective intelligences like ants that do this

294
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,360
when, you know, two ants or a couple of ants discover something that it's too big for them to

295
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,840
carry by themselves. They recruit their neighbors. So all these competencies, you know, this ability

296
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,840
to hold a goal in anatomical space to try to convince others of your goal to get buy into your

297
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,320
story about what should happen and sometimes you win and sometimes you lose that battle. All of these

298
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,440
are native competencies of the tissue. We didn't have to build in any of that. It's already there.

299
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,160
And in the plan area, I told you that they regenerate. And if you cut off the head and the tail,

300
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,440
this middle piece will reliably regenerate this normal worm with the right number of heads.

301
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,600
Here's the bioelectric pattern memory. This is now, we're literally seeing the memories.

302
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,160
Think of it as a brain scan, except not in the brain. We're literally seeing the

303
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,680
representations in this tissue of how many heads a normal planarian should have. So we can go ahead

304
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,960
and change them. We have the technology instead of one head, we can say, no, you should have two

305
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,320
heads. And here's a perfectly normal animal whose tissues, not the animal itself, not the brain,

306
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:55,120
but the tissues have been incepted with a new memory that says that if you should get cut in

307
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,440
the future, so this is a counterfactual. It's not true now, but if you get cut in the future,

308
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,040
a proper worm should have two heads. And so if you cut that worm, this is what you get. And

309
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:09,920
again, not Photoshop. These are real. So a single worm body, a perfectly normal and anatomically

310
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:15,760
normal worm body can store at least two different ideas of what it will do in the future if it

311
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,400
should happen to get injured. And the reason I call this a pattern memory, it's a memory of the

312
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,360
collective intelligence of the body. The reason I call it a memory is because if you then go ahead

313
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:32,080
and you cut these two headed worms in perpetuity, they maintain two headedness with no more change.

314
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,040
And so this has all the properties of memory. It's stable, but it's rewritable. By the way,

315
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,600
not genetic. We haven't touched the genetics. The genetics are completely untouched. So the

316
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,560
question of where is the anatomy of this, the answer, the genome is not really the right answer.

317
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:54,800
Yes, the genome encodes hardware that by default will say one head, but that hardware is reprogrammable

318
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:00,640
and here you can have these nice, you can push it into this other state. And by the way, you could

319
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,920
push it into a state belonging to other species. So this nice triangular headed planarian can make

320
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,280
flat heads like a Pifolina, round heads like an S Mediterranean. This hardware, again, with no genetic

321
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,640
change, this is just by altering the bioelectrical patterns that serve as the memory here. They

322
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,440
will visit these other attractors in the anatomical state space where these other creatures normally

323
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:29,040
live about 100 to 150 million years of evolutionary distance. But that's okay. This hardware can

324
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,360
visit there if pushed. And of course, not just the shape of the head, but actually the shape of

325
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,640
the brain, the distribution of stem cells are all the same like these other species. So what we're

326
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,280
seeing here is the, first of all, the hardware, software distinction in biology, the reprogrammability

327
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:52,720
of biology, the API, once you understand how the cognitive glue works that binds individual cells

328
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,200
into a more global vision of what they should be doing, now you can start communicating with it,

329
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:02,720
rewriting goals, and really collaborating with the material. This is, you know, I do a whole

330
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,720
other talk on engineering with agential materials. This is not metal and Legos. This is an

331
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,640
agential material. You're a collaborator with that material. You're not micromanaging it.

332
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,360
So let's think about where these cells come from. So here's a blaster term. Let's say it's,

333
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,480
you know, 10 or 50,000 cells in the beginning. We look at that and we say, oh, that's one embryo.

334
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,080
What are we counting when we say that's one embryo? What is there really one of?

335
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,600
But what we're really counting is stories. We're counting how many different stories there are

336
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,400
in this tissue that the cells are committed to as far as where they're going to go in anatomical

337
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,520
space. We're counting commitment and they're aligned. All of these, under normal circumstances,

338
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,440
all of these cells are aligned there. They've bought into one single story and this is what

339
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,480
they're going to build. That's what we mean when we say there's one embryo. You might ask a similar

340
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,560
question in the brain. If I showed you a human brain and you didn't know what a human was, you

341
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:03,200
could ask, so how many individual cells fit here? Like, what's the density of cells per, you know,

342
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,480
per unit volume of this medium? And computers, we kind of have some idea of how much information

343
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,480
fits into a certain number of transistors or whatnot. But here we actually don't know.

344
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:21,440
And the amazing thing is that if you take this early embryonic blaster and use a needle to scratch,

345
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,160
put some scratches into it, and I used to do this in duck embryos when I was a grad student,

346
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,120
what happens is that each of these little islands doesn't feel the presence of the others

347
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:37,280
for a while until it heals up. And so it goes and self-organizes an embryo. And then you get conjoined

348
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,320
twins like this. You can get triplets. You can get all sorts of things. And so a couple of interesting

349
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,520
things here. First of all, the number of individuals that come out of this excitable medium is not

350
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,240
known in advance. It's certainly not determined by the genetics. It could be zero, one, probably up to

351
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,360
half a dozen. So how many cells, how many individuals are really in there? Well, you don't know until

352
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,560
they self-organize. And that process of self-organization is critical. One of the things they

353
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,280
have to do is determine boundaries. Where do I end and the outside world begins? Or in this case,

354
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,240
some other embryo begins. Actually, some of the cells at this intersection are a little confused.

355
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,800
That's why in conjoined twins, one of the twins will often have a laterality defect.

356
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:22,480
We actually figured out why in the 96 for the first time. Why conjoined twins tend to have a

357
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,080
laterality of flipping in one of the twins? It's because these cells can't quite tell,

358
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,000
am I the right side of this guy or am I the left side of this guy? But overall,

359
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,920
they have to establish their boundaries. And the analogy to the brain is actually still apropos

360
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,120
because we have lots of examples of split brain patients, dissociative identity disorders,

361
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,920
all of these kinds of things where it's entirely not obvious that our brain is host to just one

362
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:54,240
coherent self. And so one way that I've been working on to start thinking about how to

363
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:02,960
understand beings, goal-directed beings in very different embodiments is to put aside the question

364
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,240
of what you're made of or whether you were engineered or evolved and really just to ask

365
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,800
about the size of your goals. What's the largest goal you're capable of pursuing? And so that gives

366
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,480
rise to this idea of a cognitive light cone. It's kind of like a Minkowski cone except a little

367
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,000
bit upside down. And so if you collapse a space onto this axis and time onto this axis, you can

368
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,920
see that different kinds of creatures can have different scopes to the goals that they can

369
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,600
conceive of. I mean, humans actually may be uniquely, their cognitive light cone is bigger

370
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,560
than their own lifespan. And that may provide some for some interesting psychological pressures.

371
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,400
If you're a goldfish, you may have some goals 20 minutes into the future,

372
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,800
but those goals are probably pretty achievable. It's very likely that you will live for the

373
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,600
next 20 minutes. So all your goals are achievable. For many humans, they know their goals are

374
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,000
guaranteed not achievable because they can see and commit to goals that are bigger than their

375
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:06,320
known lifespan. So for now anyway, this is something that makes humans kind of unique.

376
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,160
And then of course, we are all compound bodies of lots of little subunits that have their own

377
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:18,400
goals in various spaces that compete, cooperate, and interact with each other. Now, this kind of

378
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:24,080
this crazy way of thinking about things as this cognitive light cone has clinical implications.

379
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:30,000
And I like this not just because I want to make advances in biomedicine, but also because this

380
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,240
is how we know that some of this philosophizing is actually on the right track. So this

381
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:43,680
is the tiny cognitive light cone of a single cell. All it really cares about is the state's

382
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:49,600
locally here. But what evolution did is scale it up via mechanisms that I haven't really had time

383
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,920
to talk about, but bioelectricity is one of them. It's now the cognitive light cone is huge. It's

384
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,480
the size of this whole limb. All of these cells, they're not pursuing their own local agendas,

385
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,880
they're pursuing this triangle. But that has a failure mode. And that failure mode is cancer.

386
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,160
So once individual cells disconnect from the network, they roll back to their unicellular

387
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,640
cells. They can't conceive of these grandiose goals anymore. All they can remember is proliferate

388
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,080
as much as you can and eat as much as you can and go wherever life is good. And this is a human

389
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:29,520
glioblastoma. That's cancer. And so one of the things you might do then is on this weird way

390
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,160
of looking at things is instead of targeting the genes or being worried about genetic

391
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,560
defects or trying to kill these cells with toxic chemotherapy, you might say, well,

392
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,080
what if we just forcibly reconnect them to the rest of the organism? So here's a tadpole injected

393
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,960
with a human oncogene. And the bioelectric imaging already tells you, yeah, here's the first thing

394
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,960
that happens when these cells transform is they disconnect electrically from the rest of the

395
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,800
body. They acquire this aberrant voltage pattern. And if we co-inject an ion channel, it doesn't

396
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,840
kill the cells. In fact, you can see here, the red is the oncoprotein. It's very strong. In fact,

397
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,040
it's all over the place. This is the same animal. There's no tumor because even though the hardware

398
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,520
of these guys is a little screwy because they've got this oncoprotein, they're being forced

399
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,600
informationally to be part of this continuum. And that causes them to be part of a collective

400
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:27,120
intelligence that just builds nice organs. Now, again, we're able to do all this, make eyes and

401
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,160
normalize tumors and induce like regeneration in animals that don't regenerate and so on.

402
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,800
Not because we're so smart or we're doing some kind of crazy synthetic biology. All we're doing

403
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,640
is hacking the native competency of the tissue. And by the way, oh, and one other thing I wanted

404
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,520
to say is that these cancer cells are not more selfish than normal cells. There's a lot of game

405
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,040
theory that models cancer is being more selfish. I don't think they're more selfish. I think they

406
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:57,440
have smaller selves. So you can be as selfish as you want as long as your cognitive light cone

407
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,800
is large enough to encompass many possibly all beings and then it's fine.

408
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,960
And so there's this issue and this is something that Bill and our other collaborators are actually

409
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,680
working on this notion of increasing the cone of compassion outwards. So the interesting thing

410
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,720
about us engineering all this is that we are not the only bioengineers. This is another,

411
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,960
this is a non human bioengineer. And look, this is a this is an oak leaf. And you might think that

412
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,920
well, acorns always make oak trees and these leaves, we know what the oak genome does, right?

413
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,800
It makes these flat green things. But but here comes this bioengineer doesn't change the genome,

414
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,400
the hardware is perfectly capable. You don't need to rewire it. I don't have to explain to this crowd

415
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,480
why, you know, you don't use a soldering iron when you want to go from PowerPoint to Microsoft

416
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,600
Word on your laptop. This this this this animal takes advantage of exactly that,

417
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,480
which is that it lays down some signals that prompt the cells to build something completely

418
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,760
different. This is made of the of the plant cells, not the not the not the animal. Would we have any

419
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,920
idea that these cells are capable of building something like this or like this, right? If we

420
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,440
hadn't done this, we would not. And so for that reason, in our lab, we make a number of synthetic

421
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:20,480
creatures to really test the plasticity, the the the ability of these of the hardware to undergo

422
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:28,080
novel novel scenarios. And this is we call these xenobots, because what what happens here is that

423
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,600
some some skin cells are harvested from the top of a frog embryo. They self assemble into this

424
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,840
little thing, which I think is a biorebotics platform. And we are interested in knowing where

425
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:43,280
their goals come from. So here you can see they swim. They can go in circles, they can patrol back

426
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,040
and forth, they have collective behaviors. Here's one going through through a maze. So it comes down

427
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,280
this this arm of the maze over here, it's going to take a turn without bumping into the opposite

428
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,040
wall. So it takes a turn. And at this point, due to some internal mech, who knows why it turns around

429
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,240
and goes back where it came where it came from. Remember, this is just skin. Okay, there's no

430
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,240
there's no nervous system. There's nothing in there. One amazing thing they do is kinematic

431
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,720
replication. So if you provide them with loose skin cells, they will run around and combine them

432
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,360
into these little these little piles and work them and polish them. And because they're working

433
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,760
with an agential material, for the same reason we were able to do this, not because we know how to

434
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,680
how to change the way these cells behave, but we liberated them into a new context. And these

435
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,160
little piles mature into the next generation of xenobots. And guess what they do? They run around

436
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,360
and they make the next generation and the next. This is basically von Neumann's dream of a robot

437
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,320
that makes copies of itself from materials it finds in the environment. And so if you ask,

438
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,920
what does a frog genome know? Well, it certainly knows how to do this how to make this developmental

439
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,160
the hardware that goes through this developmental sequence, and, and then has these these kind

440
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,120
of behaviors, there's some tadpoles. But apparently, it also can do this. And the amazing thing is that

441
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,600
there's never been any xenobots, there's never been any evolutionary pressure to be a good xenobot,

442
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,840
where did all this come from? Why is there this weird developmental stage of this xenobot? This is

443
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:14,000
an 80 year old, 80 day old xenobot, it's changing into something, we have no idea what, they have

444
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,920
their own behaviors, they do this kinematic replication that no one else, as far as we know,

445
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:25,040
no other organism does. So, so this is really the thing when you make, or when you facilitate

446
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,920
novel collective intelligences that have never been here before. And that includes financial

447
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,560
structures, social structures, internet of things, who knows, we make these things all the time.

448
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,600
We really don't know where, where their goals come from, what their goals are going to be,

449
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,080
what their capacity for problem solving is going to be, we need to understand.

450
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,640
And lest you think that this is some special, I mean, these these cells come from an amphibian,

451
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,240
they come from an embryo, you might think amphibians are plastic, embryos are pretty

452
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,480
plastic, this is probably some some crazy embryonic cell thing. Well, here is this little creature,

453
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,480
if I asked you what you thought this was, you might think we got it off the bottom of a pond

454
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,800
somewhere. If you were to sequence its genome, you would see 100% Homo sapiens. This is, these

455
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,280
are human cells, they come from an adult human patient, no embryo stuff, adult human tracheal

456
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,240
epithelial cells, they make something we call anthrobots. We, this is a type of agential intervention,

457
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:28,240
because these anthrobots, remarkably, we found a novel capability. The capability is, and I'm

458
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,280
sure there are many others, is just the first thing we found, is that if you played a bunch of

459
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,960
human neurons and you scratch them, so you make a wound right here, these anthrobots will traverse

460
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,560
down the wound. And when they settle down, what they'll do is they start knitting the two sides

461
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:49,760
together, they heal this this this neural defect. And so who would have known that your tracheal

462
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,200
cells, which sit there quietly in your airway for decades, if you take them out and you let them

463
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,040
have a new life, reboot their multicellularity, have a new life in the new environment,

464
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,000
they become this little motile creature that can run around, by the way, can be injected back into

465
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,240
your body. There's no immune suppression needed because it's your own cells. It shares all the

466
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,880
priors with your own tissues about what health and disease are, what cancer is, what inflammation is.

467
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,360
And among other things, what they can do is they can actually repair neural defects.

468
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,800
And so, so that's just kind of the biomedical side of things, but, but more fundamentally,

469
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,440
and I'm just about done, I know I'm over time a couple minutes.

470
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,640
Just fundamentally, what we see is that what I think these are, and this is not a,

471
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,720
this is not the conventional, you know, view of my colleagues, I don't think, but, but what I think

472
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,960
we're looking at in all of these examples is vehicles for exploring a platonic space or a

473
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,160
latent space of possibilities. When we ask where do the shape and behavior of xenobots,

474
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,640
of anthrobots, of other chimeras, and of the weird things that we make, where do they come from?

475
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,000
Well, evolutionary selection is not where they come from. And I think that what normal embryos do

476
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,920
is exploit a little pinprick, a one single point of interface between this platonic space and the

477
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,240
physical world, and you get your standard reliable body. But, but what we can do is we can start to

478
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,840
enlarge these little holes by making anthrobots and xenobots and other things. We can start making

479
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:19,520
holes and, and looking around and starting to understand the structure of that space. What

480
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,240
else is out there? I, I really think that what we're studying here is, is the structure of this,

481
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,360
of this space that's around us and still very poorly understood. So just, just a couple things

482
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,960
to, to finish up here. First of all, here's what I think the biology teaches us. Everything is going

483
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,880
to change. Your body is going to change, your parts, the environment, everything is going to change.

484
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,520
It's futile to try to hold on to specific details. And in particular, biology uses an extremely

485
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:52,720
unreliable material. Everything is within, within a cell is going to go bad. There's, there's huge

486
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,960
amounts of noise. It's, it's exactly the opposite of what we do in computers, where we make very

487
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,840
reliable parts and we try to insulate each level from the level below. You don't, you know, you,

488
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,360
you just sort of assume the level below is going to work. And then, and then that's how we program.

489
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,600
That is the opposite of what biology does. Biology assumes the material is going to go

490
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,120
wrong in a million ways. Whether you're a genome, whether you're, you're a genome that has to be

491
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,440
reinterpreted by the species as it changes, you know, your parts are going to change. You're going

492
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,840
to be mutated and your environment will change. You have to reinterpret it. Brains do the same

493
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,440
as they change over time. They reinterpret their memories. Intelligence is everywhere.

494
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,720
That's because the only way to do this kind of, this kind of thing, this committing to salience

495
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,400
as opposed to accuracy means that intelligence has to be everywhere. Every part of the body has

496
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,960
to be able to reinterpret, confabulate, tell stories, new stories about what it saw and,

497
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,960
and what information it has to solve whatever the, the new problems are. This is polycomputing,

498
00:44:52,960 --> 00:45:01,520
which, which Josh Barnagar and I work out, work on the idea that biology has is, is just a

499
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,880
huge collection of systems which interpret and reinterpret each other's computations in different

500
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,320
ways. The exact same computation means different things to different observers. So it's an observer

501
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,240
focused view. You can't say, what is it really computing? And from that perspective, each self

502
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,920
is a, is a dynamic construction. It's an ongoing process of sense making of your own memories and

503
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,920
the environment and it's self reinforcing. These are, these are, these are basically

504
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:36,400
points of view. These are self reinforcing, continuously modifying points of view that seek

505
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,880
to perpetuate themselves by making sense of whatever's going on now. And this is, this is a

506
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,240
very deep idea from William James where he said, thoughts are the thinkers. If we sort of dissolve

507
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,760
the idea of the distinction between data and machine, right? And we, and we think that the

508
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:58,000
pattern itself is actually helping construct its niche. So it's constructing the cognitive system

509
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,240
within which it will prosper. Then, then all of us are really very complex bundles of, of thoughts

510
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:10,960
that have sort of closed the loop and learn to contribute to their own persistence within various

511
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:17,360
physical cognitive systems. And because biology is so interoperable, because biology solves all

512
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,880
of this on the fly, it doesn't, doesn't assume anything. Pretty much any combination of evolved

513
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:29,120
material, designed or engineered material and software is some kind of viable agent. So we

514
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,360
already have some cyborgs and we're going to have lots more in there, hybrids and chimeres and

515
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:39,600
all kinds of just different bodies and minds where all of Darwin's endless forms, most beautiful

516
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:46,320
on earth are a tiny little dot in this enormous option space of new bodies and new minds. So,

517
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:53,120
so these, so the need now for a new ethical synthbiosis is clear. This, this old idea that we

518
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,440
can decide how we're going to relate to something based on what does it look like and how did it

519
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,400
get here? Did it come from a factory or was it naturally evolved by the random processes of

520
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,120
evolution? Those two criteria are going to be out the window. We're going to have to deal with

521
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:13,120
beings that are nowhere on the tree of life with us that don't offer us easy answers the way that

522
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,440
for example, current AIs do when, you know, you can, you can kind of distinguish them

523
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,560
strongly from, from biology, but, but boy, we're going to be surrounded by, by beings that are

524
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:29,920
composites and none of those answers will be so, so trivial. And this is Jeremy Gay. He's an amazing

525
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,640
graphic artist who drew this for me. This is kind of a new version of Adam and the, and the Garden

526
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,880
of Eden because we've got our job cut out for us, but it's, it's going to be an amazing journey

527
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:45,360
because we are finally going to, I hope, get better at detecting and, and relating to very

528
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,920
diverse minds all around us. So I'm going to stop here. If you're interested in any of this stuff,

529
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:57,120
it's discussed in various papers here. These are the people I want to thank, a number of postdocs

530
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:03,680
and PhD students that did the work that I showed you today. Lots of our collaborators. These are

531
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,760
the, the people who fund us on disclosures. So these are three spin-off companies for my group

532
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,960
that have funded our work and most thanks of all to the actual animals that we deal with.

533
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,880
So yeah, that's it. Thank you so much for listening.
