0	6000	So thanks everybody for being here and letting me share some some ideas with you. If anybody's
6000	11360	interested in the details of it, you can track them down at this website. Here's all the papers,
11360	17680	the software, the data sets, everything. Here is where I put some more speculative kinds of things
17680	22160	where I talk about what I think the papers mean and so on. So you're welcome to welcome to check
22160	28080	them out. What I'm going to talk to you about today is kind of a weird topic. I'm going to talk about
29040	34720	a little bit about AI and the right way to understand AI through the lens of collective
34720	40880	intelligence. In other words, we're going to take a kind of a deep dive into where minds come from
40880	47680	so that we can actually talk about this notion of whether artificial minds have the same status as
47680	52320	biologically evolved ones and so on. And so we're going to look at those kind of questions.
52400	59680	So the main points of today, what I'd like to do is this. We're going to look under the hood
59680	67600	of biology a little bit to kind of clear out some viewpoints and some terminology that's
67600	73040	persisted with us for centuries, basically, but I think are going to have to change and this idea
73040	80560	of discrete natural kinds in biology. So we'll talk about that. We'll talk about diverse intelligence
80560	85840	in particular collective intelligence. So very kind of unconventional minds and unconventional
85840	90880	cognitive systems. And I'm going to argue that all the things that people argue about today in
90880	97520	terms of artificial intelligence are basically kind of an off ramp to a much deeper, more difficult
97520	102640	discussion about the really deep philosophical questions about what we are, what about freedom
102640	107200	of embodiment and things like that. It's actually much more, it's a much more complicated set of
107200	113280	questions than just to focus on kind of today's AIs. And so we'll talk a little bit at the end
113280	119760	about the ethics and the future of humanity and things like that. So let's start with this.
119760	123600	This is a well-known painting. It's called Adam Names the Animals in the Garden of Eden.
125360	131680	Here he is. So this is the old Judeo-Christian story where animals are showing up and Adam
131680	136800	gets to name them. Now, something important about that story is that actually it was on Adam
136800	140160	to name the animals. God couldn't do it. The angels couldn't do it. Adam was the one that
140160	144080	had to name them. I think that's a very interesting part of that story. And I think for us it has
144080	150160	two lessons. One that we're going to have to break, I think, as the future moves on. And the other
150160	154880	one that's actually very deep and that we're going to have to dive into. The part that has to be
154880	161040	given up is this notion that all of these species are discrete. They're natural kinds. Everybody
161040	166080	knows what each of these are. They're separate from the others. In fact, Adam is also a discrete
166080	171760	entity and completely different from all of the others. And this idea that you can sort of
171760	176560	number and categorize very, very specific types of beings. And that's what they're,
176560	182800	you can sort of count the animals in your environment. As you'll see in a minute,
182800	189920	I think that idea has to go. But what's deep is this notion that Adam, because he is the one
189920	195680	that has to live with him, he is the one that has to give them names. Now, in these old traditions,
195680	200000	giving something a name was very deep and spiritual. It meant that you've discovered
200000	204480	their true nature. Knowing the name of something means you know their true nature. And as I'm
204480	209360	going to show you at the end of this talk, because of synthetic biology and bioengineering and some
209360	214800	other disciplines, we are going to have to name or discover the true nature of all kinds of unusual
214800	221760	creatures that you guys will all be living with in your lifetime. So let's start there. Here's
221760	229520	the part that has to break. So here's a normal modern human. Lots of philosophy talks about the
229520	234640	human mind that does this and that and humans have responsibilities and rights and all the
234640	240960	interesting things. But we know that now, because of evolution and also because of developmental
240960	246560	biology, that this is not a sharp category. In other words, if you just track backwards in time,
247120	253680	these modern humans are at a particular point in the evolution of a lineage that goes all the
253680	258720	way back to single cell organisms. So if you have something to say about humans, you might ask yourself,
258720	264160	well, what about the humans of a couple of hundred thousand years ago? What about the hominids of a
264160	271120	couple million years ago? What about them? And just understand that all these changes are slow
271120	275040	and gradual. And the same thing about development. Whatever you think is true of humans with their
275040	282880	true hopes and dreams and cognitive responsibilities and so on. At one point, they were a single cell
282880	288240	and this process is again very slow and gradual. And so we know now that there's this continuum,
288240	293280	right? It's not just a discreet human, but actually a whole continuum of forms that you might have
293280	298640	to decide what is the status of these other forms. Not only that, but there's this other continuum
298640	305920	going horizontal here in my diagram, where we know that humans are going to be modified and
305920	310960	improved. So for various health applications, but also for augmentation technologies,
311680	316960	there's no particular reason why anybody is going to want to be stuck in the body that random vagaries
316960	321840	of evolution left them with. So, you know, I don't think anybody really thinks that a mature,
321840	326800	modern humanity, you know, a hundred years from now is going to be susceptible to the same dumb
326800	331680	diseases, lower back pain, astigmatism, viruses. You know, presumably all that is going to get
331680	337680	fixed. There's nothing magic about where evolution happened to have dropped us. And so there are
337680	343200	technological modifications. There are biological modifications that will be made. And that's because
343200	348960	at every level of organization in our bodies from subcellular materials all the way up,
348960	354080	you can introduce different kinds of novel engineered components. And so all of this is
354080	359040	now possible. And again, if you have thoughts about what a human is versus what a machine is,
359040	363760	you have to ask yourself, how are you going to distinguish this when you are confronted with
363760	369280	all sorts of beings along this continuum? You know, you're going to need to find ways to relate to
369280	374080	them. And so one of the things that I've been working on for some years now is a framework to
374080	381120	be able to recognize, to create, and to ethically relate to truly diverse intelligences that we
381120	385360	can have relationships with regardless of their composition, meaning what they're made of,
385360	390640	or their origin story, where they evolved, did they come out of a factory or some combination of
390640	395600	those. And that means that we need to think about all of these things. So familiar kinds of creatures
395600	400880	like primates and birds and maybe an octopus and so on. But also all kinds of weird organisms
400880	406720	like colonial organisms, swarms, synthetic engineered new life forms, artificial intelligence
406720	412080	is whether robotic, meaning embodied or pure software AI, and maybe even someday aliens,
412080	417680	right, there's probably some sort of exobiological life form out there somewhere with that at some
417680	422240	point we'll confront. Now, we need to be able to think about all of these in the same way,
422240	427200	regardless of where they came from or what they're made of. Now, I'm not the first person to try for
427200	434000	this. So here's Rosenbluth, Wiener and Bigelow in 1943, trying for this scale all the way from
434000	438720	passive matter. So, you know, rocks and sand and things like that, all the way up to different
438720	444080	kinds of active matter, and then various kinds of computational matter, and agential materials,
444080	448560	which is what I'm going to be talking about today, all the way up to some sort of human
448560	454400	metacognition, you know, complex, complex human kinds of minds and beyond. And the goal of this
454400	459600	kind of framework is not just it's not philosophy. The goal is to first of all, move experimental
459600	466240	work forward. So, part of my framework is a very strong insistence that when you look at something
466240	472080	and you say that's not real cognition or that, you know, that is real, you know, this thing really
472080	476480	does have intelligence. The goal of this is not just to have philosophical feelings about it,
476480	484000	it's to have a toolkit for interacting with these systems that is beneficial, that gives us new,
484080	489680	brings new discoveries, new capabilities, biomedicine, engineering, and so on. And also puts
489680	494000	ethics on a better footing, because these old categories that we've had for a really long time
494800	500240	for how we deal with other beings are really not going to be of use anymore, and the details are
500240	507600	all here if you want to follow that. So, a basic fact from developmental biology is that we all
507600	512000	make this amazing journey from what people call just physics. I really don't like that phrase,
512000	517920	but people use it. So, just physics to a complex mind. So, each of us started life here as a single
517920	524160	cell, a little blob of chemicals, and slowly and gradually it became something like this, or even
524160	528720	something like this. So, you know, a complex metacognitive being who's going to say things about
528720	533520	not being a machine and so on. This process is gradual. You need to understand developmental
533520	538960	biology gives us no magic bright line at which point, boom, you know, you were just chemistry
538960	543120	and physics, but bang, there, there, that this is where the mind appears. There isn't anything
543120	548080	like that. It's a very slow and gradual process. And so, what that means is that scientists and
548080	554560	philosophers need to develop a story of scaling. We need to understand how the properties of this
554560	558480	thing, which follows the laws of chemistry and physics, ends up being something that's also
558480	563440	describable by the laws of psychology and psychoanalysis and things like that.
564400	570880	The reason that this is possible is because we are all made of an agential material, unlike legos
570880	575760	and wood and metal and things like that, that basically just stay where you put them. We are
575760	580160	made of a material with agendas. And so, this is the kind of thing we're made of. This is a single
580160	586640	cell, okay? This happens to be a free-living organism called a lacrimaria. You can see that
586640	591600	it's extremely competent in its local unicellular goals. So, there's no brain, there's no nervous
591840	597040	system, there are no stem cells. But this thing is doing everything it needs to maintain its
597040	604720	physiological, its metabolic, and behavioral goals. So, the first kind of shocking thing to
604720	612320	some people that you need to realize is that we are all made of this interesting kind of
612320	616880	stuff that has its own agendas. I don't have time to tell you about it today, but the reality is
616880	622560	these things, ourselves, can learn. They can actually have pretty complex problem-solving
622560	629600	capacities in different kinds of environments. And so, we are a very interesting construction of a
629600	633680	very unusual type of material with which we are just now starting to learn how to engineer.
634240	639520	But at least, you might think, at least we are a true unified intelligence, right? So,
639520	644960	maybe you can call an ant colony some kind of collective intelligence, but we have a brain
644960	650400	where we feel like a single unified being. So, at least we are a true unified intelligence.
650400	656400	And in fact, René Descartes really liked the pineal gland because there's only one of them
656400	661600	in the brain. And he thought that that's where the human experience was centralized because
661600	667200	there's no multiple aspects of it, there's just one in the brain. But if he had had access to a
667200	671680	microscope, he would have discovered that inside this pineal gland is all this stuff, it's a bunch
671680	677600	of cells, and inside of each of those cells is all this stuff, okay? There isn't one of anything
677600	682480	in the brain, and all of us are collective intelligences. We are all made of parts that do
682480	687840	things. And the real trick here, again, is that scaling story is to tell a convincing,
688880	693040	to give a convincing account of how it is that all these parts give rise to something that is a
693040	699040	centralized, that has the feeling of being a centralized unified self. And so, this is what
699040	704640	my group works on. Now, it's interesting that Alan Turing, who is basically the father of
704640	714000	modern computer science, he was very interested in machine intelligence and in computation and
714000	719200	programmability and things like this. And so, everybody knows that part. But one weird thing
719200	724320	is that he also published this paper called The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, which was
724320	728880	basically an attempt to understand how the chemicals of an embryo organize into order
728880	734560	from their initial disorder. Now, you might wonder why would a guy who's interested in
734560	740640	computation and intelligence and machine minds and things like that, why would he be studying
740640	744320	the chemicals in an embryo? And I think that, although he didn't write about it,
744320	751680	I think that Turing saw a very profound truth, which is that the process by which bodies come
751680	756160	to be in this physical universe, by which your body was self-organized from a bunch of chemicals
756160	762880	in the other side, is very closely related in a profound way to the question of where minds come
762880	768880	from. So, the origin of the self-assembly of your mind and of your body are very related stories,
769760	777520	even though they're treated by completely different communities. So, neuroscience and the
777600	783040	behavioral sciences versus developmental biology, molecular biology, cell biology, typically those
783040	786960	folks do not think they're studying the same thing. And I think they're studying exactly the
786960	794080	same thing just in different components. So, to look a little further into where we come from.
794080	800880	So, this is an embryonic blastoderm. So, that's basically a flat sheet of cells. So, in the
800880	805760	beginning, what will happen is that the egg will get fertilized, it will divide, and then eventually
805760	810400	flatten out and give rise to, at least in amniotes like us, it will give rise to a
810400	815760	flat sheet of cells. So, you can think about like a little disk or something like that. That's just
815760	820080	a couple cell layers thick. And so, here's your disk. And so, let's just imagine there's about
820080	824560	50,000 cells at this point in this disk. And we look at it and we say, ah, there's an embryo,
824560	828080	maybe a human embryo or a mouse embryo or something. Actually, mice have a different
828080	832000	structure than this. They're kind of weird, but let's say rabbit. So, human or rabbit or some other
832880	837920	amniotes. You look at that and you say, there's one embryo, but there's 50,000 cells. What are you
837920	841840	actually counting when you say there's one embryo? Well, what you're counting is,
843200	847280	you're really counting alignment. You're counting the fact that all of those cells
847280	853600	are committed to the same story of what they're going to do in anatomical space. They're all
853600	859520	going to collaborate to build a very particular kind of embryo. They are all connected together
859520	863760	and they are all going to cooperate to do one specific thing, which is to build that.
863760	867600	That's what makes this an embryo. What makes this an embryo is that all of these cells are
867600	874880	committed to the same plan. That doesn't have to be the case. And so, this is some work that was
874880	882480	first done in the 40s. I did it again when I was a grad student in the 96 or so. When you take a
882480	889120	duck embryo and you use a little needle to scratch some scratches into it like that, what you'll see
889200	894240	is these little islands here for the next few hours before they rejoin again, each of these
894240	898240	islands doesn't realize the other one is there. So, what they do is they self-organize a new
898240	901520	embryo. Each one of them thinks they're the only one, so they make an embryo. And when they do
901520	908240	heal up, you end up with this kind of conjoined twin or triplet. You end up with a few individual
908240	914240	animals coming out of the same blastoderm. So, the question of how many beings, how many cells
914400	919440	are actually in an embryo is tricky. It's not fixed by the genetics. It's anywhere from zero to
919440	926560	probably half a dozen or more depending on what happens. The cells arise in this medium, this
926560	935200	cellular blastoderm in real time as a process of physiology. It's not hard-coded. And what that
935200	941200	means is that a self has to put itself together. It has to figure out a border between itself
941200	946320	and the outside world. So, here's three embryonic fields sitting there. Each of these cells has
946320	952080	to decide, am I part of this one, or am I part of that one, or who am I part of? And this kind of
952080	958240	thing, this medium that can fragment or come together to form some number of coherent individuals
958240	964000	is not just for development. This happens in the brain as well. So, we have split brain patients
964000	970240	that have a cut between their two hemispheres that actually end up having, you then find out that
970320	974400	they have actually, in an important sense, there are two individuals in there that have different
974400	979760	opinions and so on. You can have lots of dissociative identity disorders and various other phenomena
979760	986960	that make it clear that it's not so simple as the brain has one cognitive owner and the body
986960	994960	has one embryo. It's actually not that simple. And you learn about this when you think about
994960	999520	something like this. So, here's a rat. You train the rat to press the lever and get a delicious
999520	1004880	reward. But the thing is that there are cells in this rat that interact with the lever. There are
1004880	1010960	cells in this gut that get the sugar, but there is no single cell that has both experiences. So,
1010960	1016320	who is it that owns this associative memory, the fact that the pellet is associated with pressing
1016320	1021200	the lever? Who owns that? Well, the owner of that memory is not any individual cell. It's the entire
1021200	1026480	rat. It has to be because no cell has that experience. And there's a kind of cognitive
1026480	1030960	glue that operates in this rat, which we know as the nervous system, which allows the rat to know
1030960	1036240	things the individual cells don't know, such as that these two facts are connected. So, that cognitive
1036240	1042480	glue is a very interesting thing. We're going to study that more of that momentarily. But I want
1042480	1049440	to be clear that these animals that you typically hear about are not the only game in town as far
1049440	1053840	as some very interesting aspects of what the biology is trying to tell you. I'm going to show
1053840	1059840	you a couple of these examples just to sort of expand our horizons about what we need to understand.
1060560	1065280	So, here's a caterpillar. This caterpillar lives in a two-dimensional world. It's a soft-bodied
1065280	1069920	creature. It has a controller, a specific brain that's very well suited for driving this kind of
1069920	1076400	soft body around. But it needs to turn into this. This is a flying kind of creature with hard elements
1076400	1083120	and the brain basically, during this metamorphosis process, when the caterpillar turns into the
1083120	1088320	butterfly, what happens is that the brain is pretty much dissolved. So, most of the connections are
1088320	1093600	broken. Most of the cells are killed off. Huge refactoring, remodeling, new cells, new brain
1093600	1099680	is built, quite different, and there's your butterfly. So, that already is kind of amazing.
1099680	1105600	And you can imagine the sort of philosophical question of what's it like? Never mind what's it
1105600	1110400	like to be a caterpillar. What's it like to be a caterpillar changing into a butterfly in real
1110400	1114800	time? Not just on an evolutionary timescale, but in your lifetime drastically. Never mind
1114800	1120800	puberty. This is a major change. So, that's the first thing. But the second thing is that
1120800	1126400	it turns out that memories persist through this process. So, a caterpillar that learns
1126400	1131920	something will still remember it as a butterfly. So, that's amazing. How do memories persist when
1131920	1138320	the brain is basically getting radically refactored? But it's even more than that because, let's say,
1138720	1143280	what they did was to train caterpillars to look for leaves at a particular color disc.
1144960	1148160	That kind of information is completely useless to the butterfly because, first of all, the
1148160	1153520	butterfly doesn't crawl. It flies. And also, it doesn't eat leaves. So, this process has to be
1154080	1160080	not just the storage of memory. It has to actively remap from what's important to the
1160080	1164880	caterpillar to what's important to the butterfly. It has to generalize from the concept of leaves
1164880	1169200	to the concept of food and from specific crawling motions that you might think is what this
1169200	1173760	simple animal is remembering to something much more complex, a navigational process that will
1173760	1178400	actually be implemented by flying here, by completely different muscles and a different
1178400	1185360	architecture. So, this radical process of change, and you might think about what happens to the
1185360	1191840	individual identity of this organism and what it would be like if the caterpillar knew what was
1191840	1195520	coming and said, well, you're going to change radically, but don't worry, you'll still have
1195520	1199040	some of your memories. It's just your priorities will be different. You love leaves now, but you're
1199040	1204080	not going to care about leaves at all later and you'll want this weird nectar. What is that like?
1204080	1208080	And we'll come back to this at the end of the talk. How would you convince a creature like this
1208080	1213040	that this is a perfectly fine thing for them to go through and are they still here? Is this organism
1213040	1217440	actually still here by the time you get to this stage? And the reason this is important for us
1217440	1222800	is because humanity is going to change in a way that's somewhat reminiscent of this.
1223680	1228320	So, that's one kind of example. Another example are these. These are amazing creatures called
1228320	1233600	planaria, they're flatworms, and when you train them to expect food on these little bumpy circles,
1234240	1239040	they will remember, and if you cut off their heads with their brain, the tail will sit there
1239040	1243680	doing nothing. Eventually, the tail will regrow a brand new head, so they regenerate, every piece
1243680	1248160	will regenerate, and eventually, when they regenerate, you find that they still remember
1248160	1253120	the original information. So, the memory, not only does this tell you that the memory can be
1253120	1258640	stored outside the brain, but also that it can be imprinted onto a new brain as the brain develops,
1258640	1265120	so the movement of memories through tissues. So, all of this is possible because we have this
1265120	1271440	amazing multi-scale competency architecture. At every scale in your body, from the molecular
1271440	1277520	networks to the organs and tissues and even groups, these different layers are not just
1278080	1283280	biological scales, but actually, they have the ability to solve problems. In other words,
1283280	1288240	they have competencies in different spaces. In the space of possible gene expressions and
1288240	1296800	physiological states and anatomical layouts, all of these things have the ability to solve problems.
1296800	1301600	I don't have time to show you a whole bunch of examples today, but there are some amazing
1301600	1307680	examples of these things solving various problems. Now, the thing to keep in mind is that we humans
1307680	1314560	are pretty terrible at detecting intelligence. I mean, we do okay with middle-sized objects
1314560	1321120	moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space, crows and birds and maybe a dolphin
1321120	1326400	or something like that. We can kind of recognize those as intelligence, but there
1326800	1333680	are other spaces in which complex creatures navigate and spend effort and try to achieve
1333680	1340320	goals and so on. There are gene expression spaces and physiological spaces. I want to focus today
1340320	1347360	on what's known as anatomical morpho space. It's just basically a multi-dimensional space
1347360	1352560	of all the different shapes that any structure can have. So, in this particular case, here's a
1352560	1356400	planarian head and it can have different shapes, and these different shapes correspond to the
1356400	1361120	different settings of these two control knobs, and so you have this two-dimensional space that
1361120	1367360	shows you where all the different planarian shapes are. The actuality is for complex organisms,
1367360	1373520	very high-dimensional space. What I want to look at is, I've told you that we're all made of cells,
1373520	1380160	that these cells underlie the emergence or the self-assembly of a unified self, both of
1381040	1386640	them, cognitively and morphologically, and I want to look at how that works.
1387680	1393840	So, here we are. We start life as a collection of embryonic cells. This is a cross-section
1393840	1401600	through a human torso. So, just imagine where does this incredible order come from, the structure.
1401600	1406000	Everything is in the right place, the right shape, the right size, next to the right thing.
1406000	1410320	Where does this order come from? And at that point, even, I mean, I've given the version of this talk
1410320	1414640	to middle schoolers, and even nine-year-olds will immediately say, well, it's in the genome.
1414640	1419680	We know where it is. It's in the human genome. But, of course, we can read genomes now, and we know
1419680	1424880	that that isn't what the genome specifies at all. The genome talks about proteins. The genome
1424880	1431120	specifies the tiny molecular hardware that every cell gets to have. This isn't directly in the genome
1431120	1436800	anymore than the structure of a termite nest or the shape of a spider web is in the genome of
1436800	1441680	those species. All of this is the outcome of physiology and behavior. It's the outcome of
1441680	1445600	these cells doing their thing with the hardware that they've been given by their genetics.
1446160	1452400	So, if the DNA specifies the hardware, how do these cells actually know what to build?
1452400	1456400	How do they know when to stop? If we want to convince them to repair something that's been
1456400	1462000	damaged, how do we communicate that to them? And as engineers, we can ask, actually, what
1462000	1466560	else is possible? What else can we convince them to build? Same exact hardware, but what more could
1466560	1473040	they build? So, I want to give you a couple of examples of the amazing nature of this process,
1473040	1476800	because, see, when you look at this, you might think that, well, the biggest thing this thing
1476800	1481760	has going for it is reliability, that basically it happens the same every single time. And that's
1481760	1486000	true. Reliability is amazing here, but I want to show you that it's actually much more than that.
1486880	1493200	What you're looking at here is the cross-section of a little tubule leading to the kidneys of a
1493200	1500480	psalmander. And normally, there's about eight to 10 of these cells that work together, and they
1500480	1505120	form this little structure with a space in the middle. You can do this weird trick where you
1505120	1510800	cause multiple copies of the genetic material to build up in the very early embryo. And so,
1510800	1515600	when that happens, you still get a normal animal, and it's normal size, but the cells are bigger.
1515600	1519680	And when you take a cross-section, you find out that, well, the cells are bigger, and so now,
1520320	1526320	fewer of them created the same kind of lumen. So, let's see where we are so far.
1527600	1533840	Multiple copies of your chromosome, no problem. Weird cell size, no problem, because you'll scale
1533840	1539280	it to the number of cells. And most of all, if you make truly gigantic cells, and you do these,
1539360	1546640	these are, I think, 5N or 6N polyploid newts, when you do this, one single cell bends around itself
1546640	1551520	to give you the exact same kind of structure. Now, that's remarkable because this is a different
1551520	1555760	molecular mechanism. This is cell-to-cell communication. This is some sort of cytoskeletal
1555760	1560880	bending. And so, what this means is that in the service of a particular high-level anatomical
1560880	1566720	structure, these cells can call on different molecular mechanisms to solve their problem.
1566720	1570640	Okay? So, they're using different tools in their toolkit to get to where they're going.
1570640	1576160	That is a very good definition of intelligence, to reuse the affordances you have in the service
1576160	1581440	of a goal when things change. So, when you're a salamander coming into the world, you don't know
1581440	1585920	how many copies of your genetic material you're going to have. You don't know how many cells you're
1585920	1590480	going to have or what the size of the cells are going to be. You still need to be able to get the
1590480	1596640	job done. So, this is not a matter of just being reliable with fixed parts. This is the idea
1596640	1602800	that what evolution is making is problem-solving agents. It's making a system that is ready for
1602800	1606880	many, many unexpected things. And not just environment, not just when somebody bites your
1606880	1612000	leg off and the salamander regenerates it. No, this is unreliability of your own parts. This is not
1612000	1616640	even being sure of what you're made of. You really can't depend on much. And that's an amazing thing.
1616640	1620080	And it's quite different than what you normally get in a biology curriculum where they tell you
1620080	1626320	that your genome, the purpose of your genome is to carry information from a long time away with
1626320	1631440	maximal fidelity and to minimize errors. And every cell is going to do whatever the genome
1631440	1637440	says. And in the end, you get this emergent thing. Actually, that's not at all what's happening here.
1638800	1645440	Here's another example. We discovered this a few years ago. These tadpoles need to become frogs.
1645440	1650320	In order for this tadpole face to make a frog face, all the organs have to move. So, the eyes
1650320	1655200	have to move, the jaws have to move, and so on. And they normally do this quite reliably. But it
1655200	1659120	was thought to be a hardwired process. You know, people thought that, well, every organ just moves
1659120	1664320	in the right direction, this fixed amount, and that's it. What we did was we created these so
1664320	1669040	called Picasso frogs because we wanted to test how much intelligence is actually in that process,
1669040	1673280	how much, what kind of problems can it solve? So, we scrambled everything. You can see here,
1673280	1676960	the eyes on the top of the head, the mouth is off to the side, everything is just a complete mess.
1677520	1683040	And these guys still become normal frogs because all of these organs will move now in novel paths,
1683040	1688240	paths that these guys don't do, until they get to a correct frog face, and then they stop.
1688240	1694320	And so, what evolution actually has given you is not a hardwired set of instructions,
1694320	1699360	but a system for error minimization. Okay, for a way of wherever you happen to start out,
1699360	1703280	do whatever you have to do to end up in this particular location. This again,
1703280	1707280	this kind of goal-directedness is something else that you're not going to see in your
1707280	1712720	developmental biology textbook. This is not emergence, and this is not simply an increase
1712720	1718400	of complexity. This is problem-solving. And that raises an obvious question about how does it know
1718400	1724160	what the correct face looks like? Where is the memory for that set point of that homeostatic
1724160	1728880	process? I want to show you a couple of other things related to the plasticity of this. So,
1728880	1735520	just so you understand how much play there is between the fixed hardware of your genetics
1735520	1740240	and the actual outcomes. First of all, this here, you might think this is a photoshop or
1740240	1745600	something. I didn't believe it the first time I saw it, but this fly is running a stripped-down
1745600	1751520	ant morphogenetic program on its wings. It's running a virtual ant on its wings, and the idea
1751520	1758240	is that it wiggles its wings to simulate these ants scurrying about, and that keeps the predators
1758240	1765120	away because they don't want to deal with ants. And this is amazing, of course, and it's striking
1765120	1770240	that it has this pattern, but it's no more striking than the much more intricate pattern
1770240	1776560	of the actual fly. I mean, all of these are specific morphogenetic patterns, whether 2D
1776560	1783760	or 3D, carried out on this kind of hardware. And you might think that the outcomes are pretty
1783760	1789520	fixed. I mean, here's an acorn, and you know that all the time what these acorns give rise to is
1789520	1796240	these oak leaves. And you might think that you know what the oak genome actually does. It encodes
1796240	1802160	this particular shape, but along comes a bioengineer, and this is a non-human bioengineer. This is a
1802160	1810000	little wasp, and what these wasps do is they provide some signals that prompt the rest of the
1810000	1816560	tissue to build something like this. They're hacking the morphogenetic competencies of this leaf.
1816560	1821920	They're not changing the genome, and what they're doing is providing some instructions that cause
1821920	1828160	the leaf cells to adopt a different set point in anatomical space. Now, would you ever have any idea
1828160	1832560	looking at these flat green leaves, and how reliable they are? Would you have any idea that
1832560	1837680	they're capable of building something like this? I mean, we have no idea. So that just reminds us
1837680	1842960	that this whole notion of developmental constraint is really probably a constraint in our thinking.
1842960	1848400	It's not a constraint in the biology. The option space for morphogenesis is enormous,
1848400	1853440	and what we need to do is to discover the prompts, the language that we can use to get
1853440	1857680	them to build other things, and it clearly doesn't require modifying the hardware.
1858480	1864960	The genetics of this thing are still completely intact. So now comes kind of the meat of the
1864960	1870720	talk, which is that if morphogenesis is the behavior of a collective intelligence operating
1870720	1876960	in anatomical space, that's what I've been getting at for the last few slides, is the idea that
1878880	1884400	the act of creating complex anatomical shapes is really behavior. It's behavior in an anatomical
1884400	1889280	space of possibilities, and it's done by a collective intelligence, which just like us,
1889280	1893120	we're all collective intelligences, but that collective intelligence thinks about shape as
1893120	1897600	opposed to moving around in 3D space. So now we need to ask, how do we communicate with that
1897600	1902560	intelligence? I mean, the WASP did it through millions of years of evolution. We would like
1902560	1908000	to do it faster. And where does it store its memories? These are some things that we've been
1908000	1914000	looking at. Well, we know that one way to store memories and communicate with a collective
1914000	1920000	intelligence is through the nervous system. Now, the nervous system does it via computations
1920000	1926240	in an electrical network, and you can actually try to decode those. This is the work of people
1926240	1930720	doing a neural decoding to try to read the electrical activity of the brain and to know
1930720	1935840	what thoughts and preferences and memories and so on the system has. Well, it turns out that
1936880	1942960	this system, this ability to store memories in an electrical network, to use an electrical
1942960	1948480	network to integrate information across many, many, many cells, both in space and in time,
1948480	1952720	is something that evolution discovered a really long time ago. It is way older than nerve and
1952720	1959680	muscle. Bacterial biofilms were probably the first to do this, so long predating multicellularity.
1960880	1966640	And what we've done is to develop some of the first tools to read and write the mind of the
1966640	1972800	collective intelligence of your body. So by taking a lot of the concepts from neuroscientists and
1972800	1978480	really emphasizing this idea that neuroscience isn't about neurons at all. Neuroscience is really
1978480	1984720	about scaling of information from tiny competent subunits into much larger coherent cells that
1984720	1989760	have higher intelligence in other spaces. That's really what this is about. And that doesn't just
1989760	1993440	work in the brain, that works in your entire body. So the first thing I want to show you is
1993440	2000000	some of the techniques that can be used. One thing we have is this thing we develop called
2000000	2005280	voltage sensitive fluorescent dye imaging. And that means that without having to poke the cells
2005280	2010720	with electrodes, you can get in real time, this is a time lapse of a frog embryo, this is a frog
2010720	2016720	putting its face together, you can get a map of all the electrical states and thus you can try to
2016720	2022800	learn to decode what the system is trying to build. What are the computations that they're
2022800	2032320	doing? We call this the electric face. This is a bioelectric map of the face ectoderm long before
2032320	2036080	any of these organs actually appear. You can see that cells already know here's where we're
2036080	2040480	going to place the eye, the left eye actually comes in a little bit later, here's where the
2040480	2044880	mouth is going to go, here are the placodes. This is you are literally seeing the way you
2044880	2051040	would with a brain scan, you are literally seeing the content of the collective intelligence of
2051040	2056720	morphogenesis in the body of these animals. So these are normal patterns, in fact these are
2056720	2062640	required for normal development as I'll show you momentarily. But here's a pathological pattern,
2063280	2067760	and this is induced by injecting a human oncogene into these embryos which eventually
2067760	2073600	will make a tumor. But these tumors have an aberrant bioelectrical profile because what happens,
2073600	2078160	the first thing that happens with this oncogene is that it causes an electrical disconnection
2079200	2085360	from cells from their environment. And when cells disconnect, they immediately lose the ability
2085360	2090720	to remember these large grandiose goals that they were working on, so making complex organs and
2090720	2096160	fixing defects and so on, they're just amoebas now. That boundary between self and world has now
2096160	2101760	shrunk, that cognitive lycone where before the goal was the size of an organ or maybe the whole
2101760	2105840	organism, now it's down to the size of a single cell, and to them the rest of the body is just
2105840	2111760	an environment now. So this is where you get metastasis and progression because as far as
2111760	2116320	they're concerned, they're just amoebas living in an environment, and they go where they want and
2116320	2121280	they reproduce as much as they want. And so once you understand that, you can try for really
2121280	2126960	interesting cancer therapeutics, which is what we're doing in our lab. Don't try to kill the cells
2126960	2132400	with toxic chemotherapy. What if we reinflate their sense of self? What if we reconnect them,
2132400	2138240	forcibly reconnect them to the large electrical network that can remember what a proper organ is?
2138240	2143600	And so when you do that, so this is the same animal. Here's the oncoprotein has this red
2143600	2147520	fluorescence on it. You can see it's blazingly strongly expressed. In fact, it's all over the
2147520	2151760	place, but there's no tumor. And there's no tumor because we co-injected an ion channel
2151760	2157360	that modulates, it's an RNA that modulates the electrical property of the cell to force them
2157360	2161200	to remain in connection, despite what the oncogene is saying. And after that, it doesn't
2161200	2165840	matter that they have this genetic defect, they behave appropriately and they build nice organs
2165840	2172560	and so on. So that's a story at the level of single cells, how you scale individual cells
2172560	2182720	into a larger set of goals. But I want to show you something even larger scale than that,
2182720	2190160	which is we saw in that electric phase, there's a little eye spot which tells the animal that
2190240	2194800	that's where the eye is going to go. So we can ask a simple question, what happens if you
2195840	2201360	reproduce that bioelectric pattern somewhere else? Can you tell this group of cells to build
2201360	2205440	an eye somewhere else? And it turns out you can. Here it is, we injected some potassium
2205440	2210400	ion channel RNA into a location that normally would make a gut. So here's this is a tadpole,
2210400	2215680	here's the mouth, here's the eye, here's the gut. And if you tell these cells using an appropriate
2215680	2220160	voltage signal that, hey, you should be making an eye, boom, that's what they do. And these eyes
2220160	2226080	have normal lens, right, an optic nerve, all the same stuff. And you might see in your developmental
2226080	2232400	biology textbook that only cells in the anterior and erected are here are competent to make eye.
2232400	2237200	So that isn't true, that's only true if you try to prompt them with the so-called master eye gene.
2237200	2241360	So if you put in PAC-6 the master eye gene, yes, that's true, only these cells can do it.
2241440	2245920	But again, that limitation of competency isn't in the embryo, that's on us. That's because we
2245920	2249920	didn't know the community, didn't know the right way to talk to these cells. Once you understand
2249920	2254480	the bioelectric code, actually it turns out that almost any region in this embryo is competent to
2254480	2260880	make eye. And if you should happen to only inject a few cells, so here this is a lens sitting out
2260880	2265520	in the tail of a tadpole somewhere, if you only inject a few cells, these blue cells are the ones
2265520	2269760	we injected, then they know there's not enough of them to make a good eye, so what do they do? They
2269760	2274320	recruit a bunch of their neighbors to work with them to make an eye, just like ants and
2274320	2279600	termites will recruit their buddies to solve a problem. So now you can see that what we're
2279600	2284240	doing is providing signals. We didn't tell these cells how to build an eye, we didn't say anything
2284240	2288240	about the stem cells or the gene expression, we have no idea how to build an eye. What we did find
2288240	2292800	was a message that we can transmit through this bioelectrical interface that says build an eye
2292800	2297440	here. And once you get the cells by in so that they are convinced that that in fact is what they
2297440	2300800	should be building, after that you don't need to do anything, they will do what they do best,
2300800	2308800	they'll build to a morphogenetic spec. We know this, I want to show you, there's just a couple
2308800	2314560	of things left here, I want to show you another kind of pattern memory in these planaria, so here's
2314560	2322160	a normal flatworm. These guys, you can cut them into pieces and they will always regenerate correctly,
2322160	2327920	so every piece normally makes a nice one-headed worm 100% of the time. But there's a bioelectric
2327920	2332960	pattern there that we were able to read out and then we were able to modify it. And when you
2332960	2338800	modify that pattern, you make two-headed worms. And when you make these two-headed worms, what
2338800	2344240	happens is that you have rewritten the memory of what a correct worm is supposed to look like,
2344240	2348080	so that when these fragments, when these middle fragments go to regenerate, they consult the
2348080	2352320	pattern to see what what should a normal worm look like, they see that it says two heads,
2352320	2357200	and they go ahead and they build two heads. These two-headed worms now in plain water,
2357200	2362880	meaning no more manipulation of any kind, are now forever two-headed. If you keep cutting them,
2362880	2368320	they will just continue to regenerate as two-headed. We have permanently changed the target morphology,
2368320	2372800	the pattern to which they regenerate, but we never touch the DNA, there's nothing wrong with the
2372800	2377200	genetics here. If we were to throw these guys into the Charles River, 100 years later some
2377200	2380640	scientists would come along, they'd scoop up some single-headed worms and some double-headed
2380640	2385520	worms, they'd say, oh, cool, a speciation event, let's sequence the genome and see what made the
2385520	2388640	difference. There's nothing wrong with their genome, that's not where the information is.
2388640	2394400	And so that's really important to understand that much as we've been learning from computer science
2394400	2401920	for a really long time now, the hardware, if it's good hardware, does not fully constrain
2401920	2406320	what the software is able to do. And so this is a kind of pattern memory, it's long-term stable,
2406880	2412080	it's rewriteable because we can turn these guys back to one-headed, there you can see what these
2412080	2417120	two-headed guys are doing when they're hanging out. And so the question of how many heads should
2417120	2423840	a plenarian have is not written in the DNA, what is written in the DNA is the construction of
2425120	2430560	some biological material that by default will develop a pattern memory that says one head,
2430560	2434480	so that's what it does by default, very reliably, but you can change it, you can rewrite it.
2434480	2440400	And the fact that biological tissue is reprogrammable in this way is hugely important for biomedicine
2440400	2444880	and for other things. And so I hope you're starting to see that all the emphasis on
2446800	2451760	genetics and on the genome and all that, it's all very important because you have to understand
2451760	2456720	your hardware, but it's just the beginning. It's the same, the reason that on your laptop,
2456720	2461040	if you want to switch from Photoshop to Microsoft Word, you don't get out your soldering iron and
2461520	2467920	start rewiring because it's reprogrammable. Neither does biology. Biology is using an
2467920	2473680	incredibly reprogrammable medium that solves problems and can be communicated with using
2473680	2479760	various interfaces, for example, this bioelectrical interface. So we've talked about the reliability
2479760	2484880	of development and what things do by default. We've talked about various ways to hack, communicate
2484880	2491440	with and reprogram the collective intelligence of cells so they can build other variants on the
2491440	2496560	form. But where do these goals actually come from? So when we called up a second head here,
2496560	2500800	the second head looks just like the first head. Where are these patterns really? If it's not in
2500800	2506880	the DNA, what's the space of possible patterns? What else can we do? And by the way, I didn't
2506880	2513440	show you, but we can actually turn these worms into heads of other species, about 100 to 150
2513520	2519760	million years' distance. So triangular worms become round, become flat, but you can make the
2519760	2524880	hardware go to other regions of that space that normally belong to other species. But okay,
2524880	2531520	those are all evolutionarily defined forms. Is that it? Is that where the forms come from? They're
2531520	2540560	basically selected for and then there's a finite set of forms that can be implemented by the hardware.
2540640	2546800	Well, we decided to look at this in a synthetic kind of bioengineering way. And what we did was
2546800	2553120	we took some cells, some skin cells from frog embryos, and we let them kind of reboot their
2553120	2558880	multicellularity. We took them aside, we liberated them from their normal interactions with other
2558880	2563120	cells. And what they did, they could have done many things. They could have died, they could have
2563120	2567360	crawled away from each other, they could have made a flat monolayer like cell culture.
2567360	2570800	What they did instead is they merged into something we then named xenobots.
2571600	2576240	Xenobot because Xenopus lavus is the name of the frog, and we think this is a biorebotics platform.
2576240	2580880	So they start to swim. They have little silly, little hairs that are normally used to distribute
2580880	2585280	mucus down the side of the frog, but here they row. So these guys are rowing to the left, these
2585280	2589200	cells are rowing to the right, and as a result, this thing moves forward. They can go in circles
2589200	2593920	like this, they can kind of patrol back and forth like that. They have various collective behaviors.
2593920	2596960	These two are sort of dancing around. This one's going on some sort of long journey.
2597680	2602560	These ones are doing nothing. They have some very rich calcium signaling. You can see that here,
2602560	2607440	which is usually a sign of some information processing that's going on in these cells.
2608720	2614000	Here's one that is navigating this maze. So it's going to take this corner without bumping
2614000	2619600	into the opposite wall. So there it is. And then here spontaneously, for some reason that we don't
2620160	2624160	know, it turns around and goes back where it came from. It has spontaneous behavior. Again,
2624160	2633840	remember, this is just skin. These are just epithelial cells. And they have lots of interesting
2635120	2642000	behaviors that we can talk about. But one of the most amazing things they do is called kinematic
2642000	2646880	replication. So just imagine, we've made it completely impossible for these things to reproduce
2646880	2650800	the normal froggy fashion. They don't have any of the reproductive organs, they don't have any of
2650800	2655600	that. But in this novel configuration, they figured out a way to make copies of themselves. And
2655600	2660720	here's how they do it. If you provide them with loose skin cells, this loose material, what they
2660720	2667040	do is they run around and they sort of collect those loose skin cells into little balls like this.
2667040	2671520	And because what they're working with is an agential material, meaning these are not passive
2671520	2676480	pellets, these are cells, for the same reason that we were able to make xenobots, they make the
2676480	2681040	second generation of xenobots. And these little balls that they make mature, and guess what they
2681040	2685840	do? They run around and make the next generation of xenobots and so on. And this is kinematic
2685840	2691120	replication. It's kind of von Neumann's dream of a robot that went around and made copies of
2691120	2695360	itself from materials it finds in the environment. I mean, just think this, there's never been any
2695360	2701360	xenobots. There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot. This is not in the lineage of frogs.
2702320	2708000	Where does this come from? Their shape, their behaviors, the kinematic self-replication, all
2708000	2713520	the other things they can do. Where does that come from? It's very hard to say that this was the
2713520	2720000	subject of selection. So again, I come back to this theme that while the hardware was absolutely
2720000	2725520	selected for, I don't think it was selected to make frogs. I don't think that what evolution does is
2725520	2730880	create solutions for specific problems or things that are fit in a specific environment.
2730880	2736720	I think what evolution does is make creative problem-solving agents that they'll do the same
2736720	2742000	thing under default conditions, but once you start making changes and challenging them,
2742000	2750080	they often rise to the occasion and solve problems in very novel ways that reflect dynamics that
2750080	2758480	they've not seen before. And lest you think this is some trick of, you know, unique to frogs or
2758480	2764480	embryos, I mean, when we first published all this stuff, some people said, well, frogs, amphibians
2764480	2769680	are pretty plastic and embryos are especially plastic. So maybe this is some kind of a specific
2769680	2778800	thing in frog embryology. So the last thing I want to show you is this. So here's this little guy
2778800	2783040	running around and I will ask you what this is. And you might think that this is something I got
2783040	2787520	off the bottom of a pond somewhere, right, some sort of primitive organism. And then I can tell
2787520	2793120	you that, well, we've sequenced its genome and you'll say, oh, what's the genome? What does it
2793120	2798080	look like? And I'll say, well, this is 100% Homo sapiens. These are adult human cells. There's no
2798080	2805200	embryonics here. This is adult tracheal cells taken from human donors. Most of them elderly in
2805200	2813200	their 70s and 80s. And when given the chance, they reboot themselves and have a new life as these
2813200	2818480	things. We call them anthropots for obvious reasons. And they have all kinds of novel shapes
2818480	2827520	and behaviors. I call this kind of a technology for personalized agential interventions because
2827520	2834160	if you ask, what can these things do? Well, one thing they can do is this. If you take human neurons
2834160	2838960	and plate them on a dish and put a big scratch through them, these anthropots can settle down.
2838960	2845120	We call this a super bot because there's probably 10 of them here. They'll settle down and within a
2845120	2849520	few days you lift them up and you see that what they did was they took the two sides of the wound
2849520	2854320	and they knitted the nerves together. So they have the ability to repair these kind of neural
2854320	2858320	wounds. I mean, who would have thought that your tracheal cells, which normally sit quietly in your
2858320	2864320	airway for decades, that given the opportunity taken out of the body, they would actually
2864320	2871520	reassemble themselves into a new kind of creature with these new capacities. And so this is, I think,
2871520	2876160	hugely important for the future of medicine because just imagine, once we understand what
2876160	2880720	kind of healing effects these guys can have, they can be injected into your body. They do not
2880720	2885440	require immune suppression because they're made of your own cells. So personalized medicine in
2885440	2891040	that way. They share with your body all the priors about what health is, what diseases,
2891040	2896720	inflammation, cancer. You don't have to build all those detectors from scratch like you would with
2896720	2902240	some sort of engineered nanobot because these are your own cells. They already understand all those
2902240	2909280	things. And so again, you start to see this plasticity. Again, what you just saw is not
2909280	2914640	some embryonic developmental stage that they're recovering back in their history. There is no
2914640	2921040	such stage. This is completely novel set of behaviors. And so now I'm going to finish up here
2921040	2926640	with kind of some big picture thinking here. What I've been telling you about all of these stories
2926640	2931520	and all of their kind of biomedical implications for cancer and birth defects and regenerative medicine,
2932320	2938480	there's a bigger picture here, which is that what we're talking about is an example of how to
2938480	2943120	recognize and how to communicate with an unconventional intelligence. It is not just
2943120	2949920	philosophy that thinking about groups of cells as decision making, memory having goal directed
2949920	2955360	beings has led us to lots of discoveries that were not made by the standard paradigm, which sees them
2955360	2961280	as simple machines. So my point is that along this spectrum, I call this the spectrum of
2961280	2966240	persuadability because it's all about what kind of tools you're going to use to communicate
2966240	2971680	and control these various systems. So here it's hardware rewiring and maybe some control theory
2971760	2977520	and cybernetics with things like thermostats. And then here maybe behavioral science and training
2977520	2982320	and things like that. And then here you have some sort of rich relationship with cogent reasoning
2982320	2989040	and so on. The idea is that we can't just have philosophical feelings about where things fit
2989040	2993840	on this continuum. Most people assume that cells are somewhere down here, that they're basically
2993840	3000080	simple machines that need to be treated that way. And that leaves a lot on the table because we're
3000080	3005840	doing all kinds of interesting things with cell training and really taking advantage of the problem
3005840	3010640	solving competencies of these things. And so we have to do experiments. And so that brings us back
3010640	3018160	to the issue of AI because the question of AI isn't about today's language models. Today,
3018160	3025040	it's pretty easy to say, well, GPT-4 isn't really like a human mind and so on. No, it isn't. And it
3025040	3029520	doesn't matter for two reasons. First, because there are many interesting minds that are not human
3029520	3038000	minds and some of them are quite alien. And second, because the whole point is that you
3038000	3041040	can't just assume these things. You have to do experiments. You have to ask yourself,
3041920	3046960	do I know where intelligence comes from? Why do simple things? And we've studied some very
3046960	3052400	simple things that have amazing, unexpected, emergent, intelligent behaviors. Do we know
3052400	3056240	where that comes from and how to recognize them? And I'll tell you that at this moment we don't.
3056240	3061120	So this is the science of diverse intelligence. And we need to be extremely careful. And I think
3061120	3068400	this is where the ethics comes in. We need to be extremely careful about not denying moral
3068400	3073600	worth and various kinds of ethical protections to beings because they don't look like us.
3074560	3080800	Humans have a very long history of trying to make separations between in-group and out-group
3080800	3094480	based on really pretty ridiculous, very surfacing characteristics. And in your lifetime, you are
3094480	3101200	going to be confronted with all sorts of novel beings. So all of Darwin's endless forms, most
3101200	3106720	beautiful here on Earth, are like a tiny corner of this whole space. You know, hybrids and cyborgs
3106720	3112720	and all kinds of non-neurotypical humans with implants and different kinds of connections to
3112720	3119200	other creatures and to other technical systems. You know, pretty much any combination of evolved
3119200	3124080	material, engineered material and software is some kind of being. Okay, there are going to be
3124800	3130400	chimeras and cyborgs. And so it's not about the language models of today. It's about beings that
3130400	3135440	are nowhere with you on the tree of life. You cannot decide how you're going to relate to them
3135520	3139360	in the old ways, which was to, you know, sort of knock on it. And if you hear a metallic clanging
3139360	3143520	sound, you say, aha, so you were made in the factory and you're boring and I can take you
3143520	3149680	apart. And that's okay. Whereas if you heard like this soft, woolly thud, you would say,
3149680	3155040	ah, well, you're a real being like me and I have to treat you well, even though we're not even very
3155040	3161040	good at that as humans. But the point is that those kinds of categories are going to be worthless
3161040	3166800	because the space of possible bodies and minds is extending radically. And we're going to have to
3166800	3171760	develop much better ethical frameworks for kind of, you know, I'm sure you've heard of symbiosis,
3171760	3176400	I think what we're really talking about is a kind of synthbiosis, where we have to learn how to
3176400	3182160	relate to beings that are different than us. And that, you know, we're going to have to figure
3182160	3187840	out how you how you detect where things are on this continuum, so that we find appropriate balance
3187840	3192080	points between objectophilia. Objectophilia is the thing where people fall in love with bridges
3192080	3196880	and, you know, they think the Eiffel Tower is, you know, married to them and so on. Right. So,
3196880	3200800	things down here, you're not going to have that deep relationship with things up here,
3200800	3204880	but other people are really trapped in the other end of the continuum where they see things that
3204880	3211920	are not like today's standard humans. And they say, you know, those are not real minds worthy of
3212000	3218080	care and respect and so on. And that very quickly devolves to a kind of idea that's basically
3218080	3223760	love only your own kind. And I think that's that's that's probably lots much worse than this.
3223760	3228480	So, we really need to, and if anybody has questions we can talk about it, we really need to ask,
3228480	3234640	you know, given all of these facts, what are what is a human actually? And I have a kind of a weird
3235360	3241040	answer to that. And if you were going on on a long journey and you wanted a companion,
3241040	3244560	what is it that you actually care about? You know, when you say, you know, you don't want a
3244560	3249040	Roomba, that's that's not enough. But what do you actually care about? It's not the DNA. It's I
3249040	3253440	don't think anybody has any allegiance to our particular human DNA or the specific set of
3253440	3257920	organs. What is it that you do want, you know, in a rich human level relationship? That's that's
3257920	3261920	very worth thinking about. So, okay, so I'm going to I'm going to stop here. I'm anybody who's
3261920	3266320	interested in this stuff. Here's a bunch of papers that go into all of this in great detail.
3266960	3271520	Most importantly, I need to thank all the people who did the work that I showed you today. So,
3272560	3277520	here are all the all the postdocs and students and everybody else who who contributed. We
3277520	3282400	have lots of amazing collaborators. Our funding comes from all kinds of people have to do a
3282400	3287040	disclosure here because there are three companies that have spun out of our lab that are supporting
3287040	3291760	some of our work. So there's some business connections here. But most of all, I always
3291760	3296960	thank the model system because because the various animals and plants do all of the
3296960	3301520	heavy lifting in teaching us about biology and about ourselves. So thank you so much. I'll take
3301520	3308560	questions.
