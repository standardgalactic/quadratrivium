WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
So this is going to be conceptually pretty similar to what we talked about last time,

00:04.240 --> 00:09.840
but it's a little more condensed and focused onto just the core price economics are the absolute

00:09.840 --> 00:15.360
basics of understanding the economics of collective intelligence. And so I'm just going

00:15.360 --> 00:19.840
to basically go through it. It's fairly dry and abstract, but the idea is if you can understand

00:19.840 --> 00:25.120
everything in this talk, then you've got the bare minimum. And anytime you want to jump in,

00:25.120 --> 00:29.280
just feel free. And we'll just go through it. It's about 20 or so slides. It should take about

00:29.280 --> 00:34.720
half an hour. And then we can discuss for the rest of the time. Great. Yeah, go for it. Fantastic.

00:34.720 --> 00:38.720
Cool. So this is a talk of prices as cognitive glue and introduction to the economics of

00:38.720 --> 00:42.880
collective intelligence. So here are our goals. Our primary goal is to learn the bare minimum

00:42.880 --> 00:47.280
economics for understanding the general abstract principles of collective intelligence.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.520
So there's a couple of things going on there. First, regarding bare minimum. So obviously,

00:51.520 --> 00:56.000
I don't know a lot about biology, but I do know some absolute basics. I have a basic concept of

00:56.720 --> 01:01.360
what a cell is, a basic concept of what DNA is. And this is helpful for understanding your work.

01:01.360 --> 01:04.960
Similarly, what this presentation should do is give you the absolute bare minimum for understanding

01:04.960 --> 01:09.360
the basic economics of collective intelligence. If you can basically grasp everything in this

01:09.360 --> 01:14.640
presentation, then you should be good to go. And regarding the abstract side of things. So biology

01:14.640 --> 01:18.960
is very useful for understanding collective intelligence because it lets you see concretely

01:18.960 --> 01:23.200
that, you know, you start as a single cell, you're just physics and there's no magical transition

01:23.200 --> 01:27.600
where you become like a real intelligence or something like that. Economics allows us to do

01:27.600 --> 01:31.920
the complete opposite where it naturally gives us a bird's eye view and we can see the whole forest

01:31.920 --> 01:35.760
without having to navigate through all the trees. And so that's going to bring in the other side of

01:35.760 --> 01:40.800
this and having the concrete and the abstract is going to be very powerful. So specifically,

01:40.800 --> 01:45.920
we're going to understand three ideas. The first is that economic production, even building something

01:45.920 --> 01:50.560
as simple as a pencil, is actually incredibly complicated. You have to coordinate across millions

01:50.560 --> 01:55.760
of people, dozens of countries and tens of years. You obviously need some way of managing that.

01:55.760 --> 02:00.320
The way that gets managed is through the price system. The price system is the cognitive glue

02:00.320 --> 02:04.720
that makes this possible by connecting people across space and time. And mostly what we're

02:04.720 --> 02:09.920
going to be focused on is how the price system works within emphasis on the idea that prices

02:09.920 --> 02:14.000
erase the distinction between other people, stresses and rewards and your own, turning one

02:14.000 --> 02:19.760
person's problem into everyone's problem. And so the hypothesis backgrounding this talk, which I

02:19.760 --> 02:24.080
cannot prove, but I think is quite plausible, is that all collective intelligences work according

02:24.080 --> 02:28.560
to the same basic economic principles. So on the surface, they might seem very different, like a

02:29.200 --> 02:33.520
cell versus a person versus an economy. But I think underneath the hood, it's all just the same

02:33.520 --> 02:38.400
economics. So let's get into it. So let's talk about making a pencil. This is a very familiar

02:38.400 --> 02:43.360
object, which we're hopefully all familiar with. This down here is a little diagram of what happens

02:43.360 --> 02:47.600
once you've got a nice block of wood. And it seems very easy, you know, you cut down a tree,

02:47.600 --> 02:53.360
you, you know, sort of divide up the wood into these slats, you slide some graphite in,

02:53.360 --> 02:57.840
you glue the slats back together, then you, you know, dice it up, and you attach some brass and

02:57.840 --> 03:02.720
rubber at the end, and you get some nice lettering for Dixon, Ticonderoga, who are not sponsoring

03:02.720 --> 03:07.760
this, but just a little free advertising. So it seems very easy to do. But in reality, making a

03:07.760 --> 03:12.240
pencil actually requires an immense degree of coordination. That seems virtually impossible

03:12.240 --> 03:16.720
once you start breaking it down. So to chop down a tree, you need a saw. So to make a saw, you need

03:16.720 --> 03:20.960
some ore, and these are going to be in different places. So maybe your trees in like Oregon,

03:20.960 --> 03:25.680
but your ores in like West Virginia. So all of a sudden you're on like opposite sides of the country.

03:25.680 --> 03:30.640
And so then you need refining processes to take that ore and make it into steel and manufacturing

03:30.640 --> 03:34.800
processes to take that steel and turn it into saws and helmets and so forth. And just as you

03:34.800 --> 03:39.120
keep iterating, it grows like this. All of these processes are very complex. They take a lot of

03:39.120 --> 03:43.840
people, a lot of training, a lot of knowledge, and somehow all of it has to come together

03:44.480 --> 03:48.960
in a very complicated way. And this isn't just true for chopping down trees, but it's true for

03:48.960 --> 03:53.680
the graphite, the brass, et cetera. All of the elements of a pencil are very complicated to

03:53.680 --> 03:58.160
actually acquire. And each and every one of them requires an immense degree of coordination. And

03:58.160 --> 04:03.360
not only are they individually very complex, but they all have to come together at the same point

04:03.360 --> 04:08.560
in space and time so that you can actually combine it into a pencil. So they all need to be coordinated

04:08.560 --> 04:13.360
with each other. And in the modern age, these processes don't even exist in the same country.

04:13.360 --> 04:17.840
So you might have manufacturing in China, wood from Brazil, your rubber from Mexico, et cetera.

04:17.840 --> 04:23.040
These processes take years to complete and they're not on any kind of shared timetable. So managing

04:23.040 --> 04:28.320
this process seems incredibly complex. And you have to manage it without a pencil because you

04:28.320 --> 04:32.400
haven't built a pencil yet. So you can't even write things down. So the question is, how are you

04:32.400 --> 04:38.720
able to do this? And what's most incredible about this process is that the degree of coordination

04:38.800 --> 04:44.080
necessary is achieved with so much robustness and reliability. But I can take this incredible

04:44.080 --> 04:48.560
pencil, which we now know takes millions of people and decades to produce. I can snap in a half and

04:48.560 --> 04:55.440
nobody cares because these pencils are so widely available. The system works so well that its outputs

04:55.440 --> 05:00.640
are entirely unremarkable. And you can easily predict that you're going to have access to them.

05:01.520 --> 05:05.360
So there has to be some kind of system managing everything. We obviously can't leave this up

05:05.360 --> 05:11.360
to random chance. And whatever that managing system is, it seems reasonable to call it intelligence

05:11.360 --> 05:15.680
because it does what we expect intelligence to do, which is to navigate around obstacles to

05:15.680 --> 05:19.760
reach a goal space. So like when COVID-19 broke out, you didn't rush to the store to buy a bunch of

05:19.760 --> 05:24.640
pencils because you knew there would be pencils if you ever needed one. One hypothesis is that

05:24.640 --> 05:28.880
there might just be a set of instructions in the economy somewhere telling everyone what to do.

05:28.880 --> 05:34.320
But in economics, there is nothing analogous to DNA where we might think a set of instructions are

05:34.320 --> 05:39.200
hiding. There are just R-no instructions full stop. So then we've got to really figure out

05:39.200 --> 05:43.840
how is this possible? And the answer to that is the price system. So this is going to be our

05:43.840 --> 05:48.320
primary focus for this talk is just the basics of how the price system works. So this is the

05:48.320 --> 05:52.560
famous supply and demand graph. This is going to be the supply and demand for pencils. All the

05:52.560 --> 05:58.240
numbers are made up just to illustrate. And so the basic way this graph works is on our y-axis,

05:58.240 --> 06:03.120
we have the price of pencils. And on the x-axis, we have the quantity of pencils. And the graph

06:03.120 --> 06:08.800
is done backwards for historical reasons. So the y-axis is going to be our independent variable.

06:08.800 --> 06:14.080
The x-axis is our dependent variable. So quantity is a function of price. And we've got our two

06:14.080 --> 06:18.720
curves here, our demand curve in red and our supply curve in green. And how each of these

06:18.720 --> 06:23.360
curves work is, first of all, the demand curve is the sum of everyone's plans to buy pencils

06:23.360 --> 06:27.760
at every price point. So how this curve is constructed, if you could just like peer inside

06:27.760 --> 06:31.200
everyone's mind, what you would do is you would say, okay, at a price of five dollars,

06:31.200 --> 06:35.520
how many pencils does everyone plan to buy? And the total amount of that is the market

06:35.520 --> 06:40.160
demand for pencils at five dollars. Then you just iterate down. So the demand curve slopes down,

06:40.160 --> 06:45.440
because as the price goes down, people, of course, want to buy more. So the price goes down and the

06:45.440 --> 06:51.040
quantity goes up as we shift out to the right. And then the supply curve is the same in the

06:51.040 --> 06:56.720
other direction. It is the sum of everyone's plans to sell pencils at every price. So you do

06:56.800 --> 07:01.360
the same thing. You just take the total amount of pencils that everyone plans to sell at each price.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.840
And the supply curve is going to slope up because as the price goes up, people naturally want to

07:07.840 --> 07:13.040
sell more pencils and make more money. And there's one special point here, the equilibrium point for

07:13.040 --> 07:18.240
supply and demand intersect. This is the point where everyone's plans match up. No one is trying

07:18.240 --> 07:22.720
to sell a pencil that can't be sold or buy a pencil that can't be bought. So you can see

07:22.720 --> 07:27.360
that the quantity of supply and the quantity of demand are the same at this equilibrium point.

07:27.360 --> 07:31.280
And this right here, it's a very simple graph, but I think it actually does illustrate the basic

07:31.280 --> 07:35.360
concept of how you could have a system that could build a pencil and how you could have a system

07:35.360 --> 07:40.080
that's a collective intelligence, because if you can arrange a system so that everyone's plans are

07:40.080 --> 07:45.440
mutually consistent, or even in the limit, if everyone has the same plan, that's the key to

07:45.440 --> 07:50.640
large-scale coordination. Everyone is going to be naturally working together rather than conflicting

07:50.640 --> 07:55.360
or at odds with each other. One final thing to notice is that the reasons behind the plans

07:55.360 --> 08:00.160
don't matter, your goals stay private. So why you might want to buy a pencil or why you might want

08:00.160 --> 08:03.920
to sell a pencil, none of that matters. So maybe you want to write something down, maybe you're

08:03.920 --> 08:08.720
making pencil art, it doesn't matter. Like this system works for any kind of plans, any kind of

08:08.720 --> 08:13.200
goals, it doesn't need that information. Given your plans, which only you need to know, it's

08:13.200 --> 08:18.960
able to coordinate everyone regardless. So this is the basic concept of how prices enable this

08:18.960 --> 08:24.640
sort of large-scale coordination. But the question is, why would an individual be interested in

08:24.640 --> 08:28.400
participating in this system? It's good for the collective, is it good for the individual?

08:29.440 --> 08:34.160
And the answer is yes, because prices help you plan. So to plan effectively, you need to know how

08:34.160 --> 08:38.240
available one resource is relative to another. Like if you want to eat fruit and you're thinking

08:38.240 --> 08:43.200
if I want an apple or an orange, you need to know how available are apples relative to oranges.

08:43.200 --> 08:47.280
If they're very available, they're probably easier to get, and so you'll have to give up less time

08:47.280 --> 08:51.200
and less energy to acquire one. Maybe you like the other one more, but you need to know how the

08:51.200 --> 08:57.440
trade-off works. So what economists say is that when a resource is less available, it is more scarce,

08:57.440 --> 09:02.320
and the scarcity of one resource relative to another is called relative scarcity. And the

09:02.320 --> 09:07.280
brilliant thing about prices is that prices track relative scarcity. So when people plan to buy more

09:07.280 --> 09:11.760
of something, which is demand, or plan to sell less of that, which is supply, the resource becomes

09:11.760 --> 09:16.640
less available and therefore more scarce. And so by planning on price, you can plan based on

09:16.640 --> 09:21.600
scarcity. So it would be hard for you as an individual to figure out how available are apples

09:21.600 --> 09:27.280
relative to oranges, but it's very easy for you to figure out how costly, what's the price of

09:27.280 --> 09:31.520
apples relative to oranges, because you can just go to the store and see that. And just to see that

09:31.520 --> 09:37.040
in this graph here. So this is our original equilibrium point that we saw previously, where

09:37.040 --> 09:41.600
they supply and demand curve intersects. So if demand goes up, it now intersects here. So the

09:41.680 --> 09:46.480
price is higher, or if supply goes down, it intersects here. So again, the price is higher.

09:46.480 --> 09:51.280
So when things become more scarce, because people are trying to use it more or make it less available,

09:51.280 --> 09:56.000
the price goes up. And similarly, if the demand were to go down or supply would go up, that would

09:56.000 --> 10:00.160
make it more available and therefore cheaper. So prices naturally track relative scarcity,

10:00.160 --> 10:06.480
which is what you need to know. And the elegance of this system is that you can plan based on your

10:06.480 --> 10:10.960
budget. So you have an amount of money, let's just say like $100 or something, you can naturally

10:10.960 --> 10:15.520
combine that budget with the existing set of prices that you can easily observe at the store

10:15.520 --> 10:19.600
to tell you every possible bundle of resources you can purchase, right? It's all just,

10:19.600 --> 10:23.520
at that point, very elementary linear algebra. You can just see all the combinations you can buy.

10:23.520 --> 10:27.600
So at that point, it's just up to you and your competencies to pick the best of all available

10:27.600 --> 10:32.480
combinations of resources that you want to purchase, which is in fact, what intelligence is all about.

10:32.480 --> 10:36.800
You have a lot of alternative ways of achieving a goal state, and you're trying to pick the best

10:36.800 --> 10:41.200
one. And the price system makes that very easy. You just say, how much money do I have? How much

10:41.200 --> 10:46.720
does everything cost? And that really simplifies the problem. And so if equilibrium prices actually

10:46.720 --> 10:51.120
do reflect relative scarcities, then that allows you as an individual to confidently choose your

10:51.120 --> 10:56.240
favorite available bundle of resources, secure in the knowledge that your plan will not conflict

10:56.240 --> 11:00.560
with other people's plans, as long as the prices are in fact accurate. And we'll talk about what

11:00.560 --> 11:05.760
happens when they're not. So what happens if plants are wrong? So we know that the price

11:05.760 --> 11:10.160
should be at this equilibrium point where they intersect so that what everyone wants to do

11:10.160 --> 11:14.240
is consistent with what everyone else wants to do. What happens if the price is too high?

11:14.240 --> 11:18.800
Let's say it's at $4 here. What we can see by going over to the right here is that the demand

11:18.800 --> 11:24.320
for pencils people want to buy or plan to buy, about 20 of them, and people plan to sell about

11:24.320 --> 11:29.040
30 of them. So what this means is that sellers are going to have this issue where they're planning to

11:29.040 --> 11:33.120
sell all these pencils and they're going to use that money to do other things, and no one's going

11:33.200 --> 11:37.760
to buy these pencils because they're too expensive. So you're going to have an issue where people can't

11:37.760 --> 11:43.680
accomplish their plans. And similarly, if the price is too low, it's a $2, sellers want to sell

11:43.680 --> 11:48.320
maybe only 16 or so, but buyers want to buy about 35. So you're going to have an issue,

11:48.320 --> 11:52.480
this creates what economists call a shortage. Everyone wants to buy a pencil and there just

11:52.480 --> 11:57.200
literally aren't enough for everyone to accomplish their plan. So the systems and conflict people's

11:57.200 --> 12:01.920
plans aren't consistent with each other. And that makes it difficult to achieve allostasis.

12:02.480 --> 12:07.920
So there, this is really matters in real life. It's not just abstract graphs. So this is an image

12:07.920 --> 12:13.760
of the famous 1970s gas lines. I don't know if this is something you necessarily, yeah, but so this

12:13.760 --> 12:18.080
is hopefully a familiar image to some people. And you can see what this issue was in the 1970s.

12:18.640 --> 12:23.120
The price of gasoline was kept too low. There were some price controls on it. And so people were

12:23.120 --> 12:28.320
seeing low prices and planning to buy a lot of gas, but people weren't planning to sell a lot of gas.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.640
And so you had these issues where people were waiting in line for hours to buy gas,

12:32.640 --> 12:37.920
and then often they couldn't even buy gas because the place had run out. So when you get the price

12:37.920 --> 12:42.720
wrong, you really do have this issue where people's plans are in conflict with each other. Not everyone

12:42.720 --> 12:47.040
can accomplish their goals simultaneously. And the system really gets jammed up in a very physical

12:47.040 --> 12:50.880
way because people are trying to do things that don't make sense based on what other people are

12:50.880 --> 12:57.200
trying to do. So we know why it's useful for prices to reach equilibrium, but why would they reach

12:57.200 --> 13:03.040
equilibrium? And the answer is simply because of people's self-interest. So if you're a seller

13:03.040 --> 13:07.280
and you're trying to sell pencils, but the price is too high, you actually want to lower the price

13:07.280 --> 13:11.200
so that you can make at least some money selling the pencils. You make zero money selling the pencils

13:11.200 --> 13:16.480
for too high of a price. So sellers want to lower the price. And buyers, if the price is too low,

13:16.480 --> 13:19.920
actually want to raise the price because if you're offering too low of a price,

13:19.920 --> 13:24.000
the seller just won't sell to you. So you want to raise the price so you can get something. So

13:24.000 --> 13:28.880
sellers are pushing the price down. Buyers are pushing the price up. And the only logical stopping

13:28.880 --> 13:33.280
point is equilibrium. So just by people's natural self-interest, the price is going to be pushed

13:33.280 --> 13:38.720
to the equilibrium point. And the basic idea here of what's going on is that your plans are

13:38.720 --> 13:43.520
functions of other people's plans. And so to accomplish your plans, you need to make your plan

13:43.520 --> 13:48.240
consistent with everyone else's plan, not because you care about them, but just because you're selfish.

13:48.240 --> 13:52.640
And the price is the variable you can manipulate to make everyone's plans congruent with everyone

13:52.640 --> 13:56.160
else's. So everyone's just naturally trying to bring things to equilibrium.

13:57.520 --> 14:01.360
So what happens if there's a new stress? And this is really going to be kind of the key

14:01.360 --> 14:05.680
section here. So let's say that you are writing something down and all of a sudden your pencil

14:05.680 --> 14:10.480
breaks and you need to go buy a new one. If the system's in equilibrium, then as we saw,

14:10.480 --> 14:14.720
every pencil plan to be sold is already planned to be bought. So there's not an easy way for you

14:14.720 --> 14:20.080
to get a pencil based on existing prices. So what you need to do is bid up the price of pencils to

14:20.080 --> 14:25.120
outcompete other buyers. You need to convince a seller to sell you a pencil by raising that price.

14:25.120 --> 14:30.480
And so what we get is this diagram. So this was the old demand. And then because you want to buy

14:30.480 --> 14:36.720
more pencils now, there's new demand based on your new plan. And there are two key facts about this.

14:36.720 --> 14:40.880
One is you can see the intersection point, which is the equilibrium price has moved up.

14:41.440 --> 14:46.960
And the quantity of pencils in the market has also gone up as well from about 25 to about 30 or so.

14:46.960 --> 14:50.720
So price goes up and quantity goes up when you plan to buy more pencils.

14:51.280 --> 14:56.080
And what this does is this is the stress sharing mechanic. So you bid up the price of pencils,

14:56.080 --> 15:00.160
just because it helps you gives you better chances of acquiring a pencil. But because you're connected

15:00.160 --> 15:05.440
to everyone else, the price system, this transmits your stress to them. So an increase in price

15:05.440 --> 15:09.040
stresses out buyers, right? They see the higher price, they go, whoa, I was planning to buy a

15:09.040 --> 15:14.000
bunch of pencils. Now that's harder to do. So I don't want to buy as many pencils, which is

15:14.080 --> 15:19.040
exactly what you need. That leaves more pencils available for you. And similarly, an increase in

15:19.040 --> 15:22.960
price excites sellers, they go, oh boy, I want to sell a bunch of pencils now and make money,

15:22.960 --> 15:27.680
which again, makes more pencils available for you to buy. So just by bidding up the price of

15:27.680 --> 15:32.720
pencils, you're communicating your stress to everybody without you necessarily even realizing

15:32.720 --> 15:37.200
you're doing so it just happens anyway. And it looks like they're generously choosing to help

15:37.200 --> 15:41.920
you out. But in reality, what's going on is they just can't tell is this stress mine or his. In fact,

15:41.920 --> 15:45.200
they don't even know about you. So they're not even asking that question. They're just seeing

15:45.200 --> 15:50.400
I'm stressed out. So I got to behave differently. And that takes care of you. And so this is the

15:50.400 --> 15:55.520
diagram, right? So your stressed out price goes up, everyone stressed out. So if this diagram

15:55.520 --> 16:00.080
makes intuitive sense at this point, then we basically accomplished the primary goal.

16:00.960 --> 16:05.120
So what we can see is that prices achieve mind melding and the expansion of perceptual fields,

16:05.120 --> 16:08.960
which is what we need for large scale collective intelligence. So as we've seen when you bid up

16:09.600 --> 16:14.320
the price of a pencil, your stress becomes the buyer stress and the reward you would receive

16:14.320 --> 16:17.840
from a pencil becomes the reward of sellers because they make more money. So we've got stress

16:17.840 --> 16:22.720
sharing, we have reward sharing. And what this does is it causes perceptual fields to get bigger.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.480
Everyone acts as if they know about your plans and they change their behavior to fit with what

16:26.480 --> 16:31.280
you're doing just because the price went up. And this is basically what lets people make pencils.

16:31.280 --> 16:37.040
The task of creating a pencil is too large for any one individual on their own to understand.

16:37.040 --> 16:41.360
But because of the way that perceptual fields get expanded, everyone's able to see

16:42.000 --> 16:47.120
what they need to see to make the system work. And one important thing as well is that the system

16:47.760 --> 16:52.640
depends on competition among the subunits to achieve this cooperative outcome. So suppose a

16:52.640 --> 16:57.600
pencil seller tries to cheat the system and pretend that there's a new stress in the economy and

16:57.600 --> 17:02.080
raise the price of pencils to make more money. What this would immediately do is incentivize

17:02.080 --> 17:06.800
all of the other pencil sellers to undercut them and steal their customers. So lying and

17:06.800 --> 17:11.040
trying to cheat the system in some way, immediately you get punished by your competition, we're going

17:11.040 --> 17:15.920
to take advantage of your poor decision to make more money. And so my hypothesis is that all

17:15.920 --> 17:20.640
collective intelligence has worked this way. We're all bound together by cognitive blues,

17:20.640 --> 17:24.960
such as bioelectricity that are in some way mathematically analogous to the price system.

17:24.960 --> 17:29.760
I think there's one way to do this. It's this basic abstract economic system. So

17:30.560 --> 17:36.000
what justifies calling this I think a collective intelligence is a shared model perspective.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.880
So prices are a set of publicly available electronically transmitted numbers that condense

17:40.880 --> 17:46.000
a huge amount of decentralized information, which means they constitute a model of relative

17:46.000 --> 17:50.800
scarcities. And it's a shared model because we all see the same set of prices. And so if we just

17:50.800 --> 17:54.640
think about like an active inference internal model thing, it seems like you can associate a

17:54.640 --> 17:59.840
self to an internal model. So if everyone has the same model, then everyone's part of the same

17:59.840 --> 18:05.200
self. So it's a collective intelligence. And what this enables to happen because everyone's

18:05.200 --> 18:09.840
sharing the same model is everyone perceives the predictions and an active inference sense of the

18:09.840 --> 18:14.720
expected perceptions and planned behaviors of everyone else, which makes it very easy to figure

18:14.720 --> 18:19.520
out how to achieve your goals while not interfering with and therefore being interfered with by

18:19.520 --> 18:25.920
other people's goals. So to return to the original question of how we're able to build a pencil,

18:25.920 --> 18:30.800
this is the basic picture of how that works. So all of the facts necessary to coordinate people

18:30.800 --> 18:35.200
across space and time are things that some individual is aware of. Maybe it's someone,

18:35.200 --> 18:40.960
a worker on the ground, or a CEO high up in the company, but everyone has some piece of the puzzle

18:40.960 --> 18:44.960
and they incorporate that piece of the puzzle into their plans because they're just that's what

18:44.960 --> 18:49.920
people do. They take their information and they plan on that basis. Then those plans, as we've

18:49.920 --> 18:54.880
seen through supply and demand, are condensed into prices such that updates to relevant information

18:54.880 --> 19:00.240
cause updates to plans, which cause updates to prices. So this is this diagram. So information

19:00.240 --> 19:06.560
causes plans, causes prices, and then changes in information yield changes in plans, which make

19:06.560 --> 19:12.800
changes in prices. And so then all people have to do rather than having to think, how do I make

19:12.800 --> 19:17.040
my information congruent with Mike's or how to make my plan congruent with his? All I need to do

19:17.040 --> 19:21.200
is make my plan congruent with prices, which is easy to do because I know what the prices are,

19:21.200 --> 19:26.000
and I know how much money I have, which then unwittingly makes my behavior congruent with your

19:26.000 --> 19:31.920
behavior as well. And so the simple signaling system allows everyone, you know, in the US,

19:31.920 --> 19:37.040
Mexico, Brazil, China, et cetera, to coordinate with each other without realizing they're doing so.

19:37.040 --> 19:42.640
And fascinatingly, this causes a massive scaling of plans and goals. So an ordinary human on their

19:42.640 --> 19:46.960
own just plans to like acquire food and shelter so they don't get eaten. But when you combine people

19:46.960 --> 19:51.200
into the system, all of a sudden people start planning to create millions of commercial grade

19:51.200 --> 19:56.960
pencils every year. So this system really scales up people's goals by making it highly attainable

19:56.960 --> 20:01.760
to achieve those goals. One interesting note about this is that if you can prove that this

20:01.760 --> 20:06.480
is how organisms work, then you would prove that cells are agents, because one obvious way to think

20:06.480 --> 20:11.360
about agents is that agents are entities that take information and turn those agents, turn that

20:11.360 --> 20:16.400
information into plans. So if you can see that the biological system is doing this, then the only

20:16.400 --> 20:22.400
way to make sense that would be that cells are agents. So just a fun little note there. So one

20:22.400 --> 20:27.360
important point as well. So we can see how helpful prices are to us. Why are they so helpful to us?

20:27.360 --> 20:31.280
And the answer, of course, is their own self-interest. They're just trying to help themselves.

20:31.280 --> 20:36.560
So the price system has two goals. It's to be an accurate model, and it's to be a rational model

20:36.560 --> 20:40.720
of the relative scarcities of all goods. And I suspect that's the goal of all models to be

20:40.720 --> 20:46.880
rational and accurate. So just a reminder, scarcity is the availability of a good relative to people's

20:46.880 --> 20:52.080
plans. The more people plan to use it, the less of the more scarcities. Relative scarcity is the

20:52.080 --> 20:56.720
scarcity of one good compared to the scarcity of another good. So what accuracy means in this

20:56.720 --> 21:02.720
context is that if apples are priced twice as high as oranges, so if apples cost $2 and oranges cost

21:02.720 --> 21:07.920
$1, then accuracy means that apples are actually twice as scarce as oranges. The prices really

21:07.920 --> 21:12.720
are attracting the relative scarcities. And rationality just means rationality in the Bayesian

21:12.720 --> 21:17.280
sense, like prices should update as a random walk, not moving in a predictable direction.

21:17.280 --> 21:23.760
And the way we know prices have these goals is because they pay people to improve its accuracy

21:23.760 --> 21:28.320
and rationality. If you're a stock trader or a commodity trader or something, and you can make

21:28.320 --> 21:32.960
the system more accurate or make the system more rational, you can become very wealthy. So the price

21:32.960 --> 21:38.080
system effectively pays us to make it more accurate and rational, which is exactly what we need in

21:38.080 --> 21:44.880
turn to enable a large-scale coordination. So this takes us to a primary conclusion, and then we'll

21:44.880 --> 21:50.000
have a couple of miscellaneous slides after. So what I think is the basic things you need to have

21:50.000 --> 21:54.240
collective intelligence, and I think this should be a universal principle. You need some kind of

21:54.240 --> 21:59.600
system that collects all relevant information and condenses it into a single shared set of

21:59.600 --> 22:04.800
mathematically useful objects, like prices, which are numbers. Numbers are very convenient.

22:04.800 --> 22:09.200
You want these objects to be something that interacts with the subunits of the collective,

22:09.200 --> 22:13.920
such as the humans or the cells, whatever, such that they persuade people to behave in the intended

22:13.920 --> 22:19.840
way, which then allow you to manipulate these prices or whatever other objects to get the

22:19.840 --> 22:25.040
system to do anything it can conceivably do, as we'll see on the next slide. You need the system

22:25.040 --> 22:30.160
to incorporate new and updated information and have that transmit rapidly and accurately through

22:30.160 --> 22:35.760
the system, which is what the stock market does. You also need a process for inducing honesty and

22:35.760 --> 22:41.360
accuracy in communicating information, such as competition. And the result of all of this needs

22:41.360 --> 22:45.680
to be a shared model that is an accurate and rational model of relative scarcities,

22:45.680 --> 22:50.560
relative scarcities being what sums up the congruences and conflicts between everyone's plans.

22:50.560 --> 22:54.080
So if everyone can see something that models the relative scarcities,

22:54.160 --> 22:58.320
everyone's going to be able to act in ways that are consistent with how everyone else is acting.

22:59.040 --> 23:02.800
So this right here, I think, is the basic details any collective intelligence needs to

23:02.800 --> 23:09.200
have and is going to have. So a few couple miscellaneous points here. So I'm arguing prices

23:09.200 --> 23:13.920
are analogous to bioelectricity, which means they should be the morphological code of the economy,

23:13.920 --> 23:19.280
and indeed they are. So this is an example I got off Twitter. So taxes are like an artificial way

23:19.280 --> 23:23.520
of manipulating the price system. You can raise the price above what it would otherwise be.

23:23.600 --> 23:28.160
And as we can see, if you tax windows, you don't get many windows. If you tax roofs,

23:28.160 --> 23:32.080
you don't get many roofs. If you tax frontage, you don't get a lot of frontage.

23:32.080 --> 23:35.120
And if you tax finished buildings, you don't get a lot of finished buildings.

23:35.120 --> 23:39.600
So economists believe that in principle, you can get the economy to do anything that could

23:39.600 --> 23:44.720
conceivably do just by manipulating the prices up and down, which is very convenient if all you

23:44.720 --> 23:49.280
have to do is manipulate prices, because that leaves the problem solving up to the subunits.

23:49.280 --> 23:55.600
So a high price says supply more of this and buy less of this, but how to supply more of it and how

23:55.600 --> 24:00.400
to live with less of it is left up to the subunits and their competencies. So just as an example,

24:00.400 --> 24:04.560
if you want less carbon dioxide in the air, as we all should, then you can just raise,

24:04.560 --> 24:09.360
put a tax on carbon dioxide. And then the challenge of how to adjust to that new price

24:09.360 --> 24:14.160
is left up to people's and businesses. So managing the system in principle is very easy,

24:14.240 --> 24:19.760
as long as you can move prices up and down. And then the final point here is what if there's

24:19.760 --> 24:23.760
a flaw in the system? What if there's a missing link? So the system works very well as long as

24:23.760 --> 24:29.200
everything relevant is being tracked, accounted for, and condensed into the price system. But what

24:29.200 --> 24:33.440
if there's something that doesn't get into the price system for whatever reason? Whatever that is,

24:33.440 --> 24:38.480
it's called an externality. So an example is just, you know, carbon dioxide like we just saw,

24:38.480 --> 24:43.280
it's not priced properly. So the effects of it aren't included in the price. So people end up

24:43.280 --> 24:47.920
doing stuff they shouldn't do, like over consuming, like buying SUVs and things like that.

24:47.920 --> 24:53.360
I believe that externality is analogous to cancer. Cancer is an example of externality.

24:53.360 --> 24:58.560
So a firm producing excess pollution is doing so because that activity isn't tied to the rest of

24:58.560 --> 25:03.600
the economy via the price system. So it treats the rest of the economy like the external environment

25:03.600 --> 25:08.960
as something to dump waste into rather than to take care of. So I believe basically externality

25:08.960 --> 25:14.160
explains economic tumors and relatedly, externality causes developmental disorders.

25:14.160 --> 25:17.840
So if there's something like weird going on in the firm, that doesn't make sense. Or if the

25:17.840 --> 25:22.080
economy is creating goods and services that it shouldn't create, that's always going to be because

25:22.080 --> 25:26.560
of an externality. And externality is kind of my thing. So if externality interests you, check

25:26.560 --> 25:31.520
out my paper on my website, the problem of externality in 2024 for more information about

25:31.520 --> 25:35.760
how that works. That takes me to the end of this. Thank you very much for sitting through this.

25:35.840 --> 25:39.520
Here's my contact information. And if this sort of theme interests you,

25:39.520 --> 25:43.760
I have an essay on my website, Prices as Memories, which goes into more detail about

25:43.760 --> 25:47.440
some of what's going on here. So thanks very much for sitting through that. I hope that was

25:47.440 --> 25:51.120
interesting and educational. And I'll just turn it over to you now. What do you want to discuss?

25:52.800 --> 26:02.880
Thanks. Wow. Yeah, extremely interesting. A couple of things. First of all, in this system,

26:02.880 --> 26:09.200
which we consistently with our multi-scale competency architectures, the individual subunits

26:09.200 --> 26:14.560
that are acting on the price, buying and selling, they're rational agents. So they have a little

26:14.560 --> 26:20.720
bit of intelligence themselves that allows them to execute these policies based on the price.

26:20.720 --> 26:27.840
Can we talk a little bit about, or say what you think about, what's the minimal set of

26:27.840 --> 26:32.480
things that they need to know and be able to do for this all to work? How smart do they actually

26:32.560 --> 26:40.400
need to be? I believe it's extremely minimal. So the basic concept of rationality is a preference

26:40.400 --> 26:47.200
order. Let me see if I can draw something for you. Maybe this is unnecessary, but let me

26:48.080 --> 26:53.200
pull up, and I don't need to do it on a computer. Let me just show you. So the basic concept of

26:53.200 --> 26:58.400
rationality is you have preferences as set, and then rationality is a complete and transitive

26:58.400 --> 27:04.640
order. So I'm just drawing something here. If this is, I don't know if this is visible,

27:04.640 --> 27:08.960
but if you can just see these three dots connected by these lines, this is a rational preference

27:08.960 --> 27:14.240
order. This is an extremely simple structure that exists literally everywhere. If you have this,

27:14.240 --> 27:17.520
you have rationality. This is the minimal competence necessary.

27:17.760 --> 27:29.360
So yeah, part of why, this is something that I noticed very early in undergrad,

27:29.360 --> 27:32.560
and part of why I'm attracted to your work. It's like, rationality should be everywhere.

27:32.560 --> 27:36.880
It's in no way restricted to humans at its core. It's a very simple, very basic thing.

27:37.840 --> 27:43.200
So yeah, so I can see, can you just connect the dots a little bit more? Definitely a

27:43.200 --> 27:49.440
preference order is something that is common in biology. Why do you get from preference order to

27:51.040 --> 27:55.840
draw the loop for me? So the price, you have a sensor that can sense the current price,

27:55.840 --> 28:00.640
something like that. You have some kind of an other interstate that says, how much do I need,

28:00.640 --> 28:05.920
whatever this is. Can we just sketch out what's the minimal agent here that you need to participate

28:05.920 --> 28:12.240
in the system? Yes. So you would have preferences over, well, in principle, potentially every

28:12.240 --> 28:16.400
possible state of the world, but at least when we're considering a standard shopping example,

28:16.400 --> 28:20.560
preferences over different bundles of goods. You've got the amount of money you have,

28:20.560 --> 28:26.480
and then let's say you've got $10 and like apples are $1 and oranges are $2. You could buy like 10

28:26.480 --> 28:31.280
apples and zero oranges or like, you know, four apples and three oranges, et cetera. And so

28:31.920 --> 28:37.440
the basics of economics is you arrange all of those possible bundles into an order based on

28:37.520 --> 28:42.240
preference where you're most preferred at the top all the way down, then you just buy your most

28:42.240 --> 28:46.960
preferred options. That's the basic competence. Can you take your options such as your shopping

28:46.960 --> 28:51.840
bundles and arrange them in a list where you can then select your favorite one on that list?

28:51.840 --> 28:55.840
And if you have any ability to do that in any sense, and actually working on a couple of papers

28:55.840 --> 29:02.160
arguing that that power does exist to a much greater degree than people realize. So actually,

29:02.160 --> 29:07.360
this is interesting. I'm working on some stuff about how human beings are diverse cognition

29:07.440 --> 29:11.200
in human beings themselves. Cognition does not work the way people think it does.

29:11.200 --> 29:15.600
And economics exists in human beings in places where people don't realize. So

29:16.560 --> 29:20.800
you don't necessarily need to see people making like shopping lists, as long as there's some

29:20.800 --> 29:25.760
ability to create an ordering over things that in some way map to options, you're good to go.

29:26.800 --> 29:30.080
But presumably there's some, if you were trying to implement this,

29:31.520 --> 29:35.760
somebody makes an offer, I want to sell you this for this price, and you can compare that with

29:36.640 --> 29:42.640
what's the, what's the calculus that you then do to decide what are you actually willing to pay?

29:45.360 --> 29:49.040
So there's two things there. So the basic calculus is you're really comparing it

29:49.040 --> 29:54.080
to your opportunity cost. You're comparing it to your other best option and saying,

29:54.640 --> 29:59.440
is this worth doing? If I do this, I don't do something else. Is that worth doing? So that's

29:59.440 --> 30:04.480
what you're comparing is your two different plans, your two different predictions. The price itself

30:04.560 --> 30:08.880
is all relative. So this is actually a key point. I'm glad you brought it up.

30:08.880 --> 30:13.520
Prices just track relative scarcities. So the only thing that matters is the relative prices.

30:13.520 --> 30:19.600
So if apples are $2 and oranges cost $1, or if apples are $4 and oranges cost $2,

30:19.600 --> 30:24.160
it's the same situation. So the price is almost secondary in a way. The only thing that matters

30:24.160 --> 30:30.000
is that it should be in some way a mirror of the relative scarcities as an ordering.

30:30.960 --> 30:37.840
But in order to, that's very interesting, but in order to do what you just said to say this

30:37.840 --> 30:42.400
over that, you have to have what? Counterfactuals. You have to have the ability to consider

30:42.400 --> 30:49.440
counterfactuals or store memories of other options or like. Yes. So what I'm basically

30:49.440 --> 30:53.360
working on in these papers, do you know, Paul, I think it's pronounced cheesek, Paul cheesek's

30:53.360 --> 30:59.280
work at all? Sure. Yeah. So he's got this action selection hypothesis, I think is really congruent

30:59.280 --> 31:03.920
with some, some recent findings in neuroscience. And basically what's happening in the human brain,

31:03.920 --> 31:08.080
and I suspect similarly in other organisms, though I don't know, is you are, when you're

31:08.080 --> 31:12.240
considering an option, you're actually constructing several options simultaneously. So like a motor

31:12.240 --> 31:17.120
behavior, I'm constructing a bunch of different possible motor behaviors all at once in my brain

31:17.120 --> 31:23.520
and anticipating how they're going to plan out. And basically very, very quickly, the brain compares

31:23.520 --> 31:27.680
all of these different options by just, they, they, they compete with each other like literally

31:27.680 --> 31:32.000
in your head and like kind of fight almost for dominance over the brain, whichever one wins

31:32.000 --> 31:36.640
that competition is probably your best option. And then that gets implemented as a result of

31:36.640 --> 31:41.680
winning that competition. So you do literally construct alternatives and have them compete.

31:41.680 --> 31:46.000
And this is actually interesting because economists for a long time, you don't feel

31:46.000 --> 31:49.600
yourself doing that. So economists thought, well, this is just like an as if you're not

31:49.600 --> 31:54.080
really doing this, but it's just useful for modeling you. I think actually neuroscience

31:54.080 --> 31:58.400
shows that this is literally happening. And so I'm actually, I have a paper title,

31:59.360 --> 32:03.680
beyond as if kind of describing some of this stuff. So I do think this literally happens.

32:03.680 --> 32:08.000
You do construct alternatives in your head. I suspect cells do the same thing, although I,

32:08.000 --> 32:13.280
I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, it may, it may well be, I'm thinking now we should take a look at how to

32:13.280 --> 32:17.680
cash out that kind of model in terms of, for example, transcriptional decisions, physiological

32:17.680 --> 32:22.080
decisions. What does it look like to be teeing up a bunch of different transcripts like gene

32:22.080 --> 32:27.680
expression, change responses in, in, in a following some sort of stimulus or a stressor

32:27.680 --> 32:31.040
or something, and then having to choose one in this, in the idea that they can compete with

32:31.040 --> 32:34.160
each other. It's, it's, it's interesting. Well, we'll have to, we'll have to see what that would

32:34.160 --> 32:41.520
look like for, for cells. Okay, let's see what else. It's really interesting to me that

32:43.360 --> 32:48.080
that the pricier plays a number of different roles, which is much like what we've been

32:48.080 --> 32:52.800
thinking about for some of the things in, in, in the biology, the kind of morphogenesis field,

32:52.800 --> 32:57.520
which is, so in a certain sense, it's this, it's, it's the middle node of some kind of bowtie,

32:57.520 --> 33:01.840
right? Because it encompasses in a, in a very compressed representation, a huge amount of

33:01.840 --> 33:06.880
other information, but also from that, it has all these fan out consequences that it sort of

33:06.880 --> 33:12.560
encodes, encodes that. To what extent, so, okay, so, so, so there's that, then, then there's a

33:12.560 --> 33:16.800
thing you pointed out about the shared model, right, that it, that it's also encode some kind of

33:16.800 --> 33:21.760
shared, shared view of, of the world and it's binding, binding everybody together into the

33:21.760 --> 33:28.000
same, same picture of the world. At the same time, it's a control knob, because by impacting,

33:28.000 --> 33:32.160
I probably should get to have all sorts of interesting consequences more widely. And as

33:32.160 --> 33:37.840
you point out at the end, it's, it also has a perspective and a degree of agency because the

33:37.840 --> 33:42.560
price itself has, has certain interests in this, which I think is one of the most interesting

33:42.560 --> 33:49.120
things that, that aspect, like watching how things can run that spectrum and can be simultaneously

33:49.120 --> 33:54.080
though, all of the play, you know, play all of those roles, I think is, is, is very interesting.

33:54.080 --> 34:02.080
And I wonder, you know, I wonder if we can say more, could we, could we say I'm in the system

34:02.080 --> 34:05.280
you've described, there are a number of layers that you can try to imagine taking the perspective

34:05.280 --> 34:09.280
of, right? So obviously, the easiest for us is the individual humans that are the individual pieces

34:09.280 --> 34:14.640
that react to the, to the price. But could we say, for example, what does the world look like

34:14.640 --> 34:19.920
from the perspective of the price itself? Right? What is its world? And I'm, I'm talking about

34:19.920 --> 34:26.000
the kind of thing that, you know, when, when, when Randy Beier does this cognitive domain

34:26.000 --> 34:29.920
of a glider, that kind of thing, when you, when you're looking at, at really unconventional

34:29.920 --> 34:33.360
agents and minimal patterns and things like that and asking what does the world look like from

34:33.360 --> 34:40.080
their perspective? Yeah. What, why don't we just start there? What do you think the world looks

34:40.080 --> 34:44.960
like if you, if you're the price? Yes, I have given that some thought. I don't think I've come up

34:44.960 --> 34:50.800
with anything terribly useful. But what does occur to me is that, you know, what the price

34:50.800 --> 34:55.120
seems to naturally want to do is to preserve itself. It wants to preserve its relationship

34:55.120 --> 35:01.120
with other prices. It doesn't want to change in any kind of predictable way, just like an organism.

35:01.680 --> 35:08.400
And it naturally achieves that just by the equilibrium price just incentivizes people

35:08.400 --> 35:12.960
not to mess with it, except as new information comes in, which then should update the equilibrium

35:12.960 --> 35:21.920
price. So it does seem to me there is at least some kind of minimal model which you can think of

35:21.920 --> 35:37.440
about prices, something like an organism that's trying to maintain allostasis and buyer. I have

35:37.440 --> 35:45.120
no idea with that. Did I cut out? Yeah, there's something I can, but there's something going on

35:45.120 --> 35:54.080
with your Wi-Fi, I think. Yeah, it might be a little unstable. It seems better now. I mean,

35:58.080 --> 36:01.360
did I cut off there? Did you get all that? I think, I think I got it. Yeah.

36:04.640 --> 36:11.120
Is there, is there any notion of, you know, like right now the price is a single scalar

36:12.000 --> 36:16.960
and that's great for many things because it's an enormous compression into a simple thing.

36:16.960 --> 36:23.920
Is there any idea about what would happen if it were richer, some kind of a higher dimensional

36:23.920 --> 36:30.880
concept? Yeah, people have talked about that. I'm not too familiar with any specific models.

36:30.880 --> 36:35.520
Right now, just getting everything incorporated into the scalars is hard enough. I do think that's

36:35.600 --> 36:42.240
a rich area for potential exploration, but I don't have any specific ideas about it.

36:42.240 --> 36:49.760
Okay. And similar to the question about the perspective of the price itself, what do you

36:49.760 --> 36:56.640
think, you know, usually in biology what we have is we have the organism and then we sort of start

36:56.640 --> 37:00.400
asking questions about the cognitive blue and how the pieces actually add up. So in this case,

37:00.400 --> 37:05.040
we're kind of going backwards because everybody believes that the individuals are our agents,

37:05.040 --> 37:09.680
but then, you know, there's this cognitive glue that you've identified that binds them together.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.880
What do you think the collective is doing? In other words, again, looking at it from the

37:12.880 --> 37:18.720
perspective of the collective, having been bound together by this, by this economic model,

37:18.720 --> 37:24.560
what are the goals, the preferences, the competencies, what does it, you know, the economy,

37:24.560 --> 37:28.480
I guess is what we're talking about. What do you think, what does the world look like from its

37:28.480 --> 37:35.840
perspective? I think the answer to that is analogous to the answer for an individual,

37:35.840 --> 37:40.800
which is less semantically clear than people believe. Like as an individual, when we talk

37:40.800 --> 37:45.200
about our goals, it's easy to say, oh, my goal is to like do some economics thing.

37:45.200 --> 37:50.560
But in reality, that's not really what's going on. My goal is to achieve allostasis by managing my

37:50.560 --> 37:55.200
metabolism and like energy regulating the ins and outs of what's going on with my body. I think

37:55.280 --> 37:58.880
that's also true of the price system. You could say, oh, like it's trying to make pencils or

37:58.880 --> 38:03.840
trying to do this or that. Really, it's trying to achieve allostasis, which it does by coordinating

38:03.840 --> 38:08.960
all of the subunits, getting everything to work together. That is in principle, its only goal,

38:08.960 --> 38:14.720
I believe. Do you think that there's the active inference perspective, like something like

38:14.720 --> 38:21.360
surprise minimization would be applicable to that agent? Absolutely. And I borrowed a lot from that

38:21.360 --> 38:25.760
perspective. And it was moving away from economics to some neuroscience, like I keep bringing up

38:25.760 --> 38:29.120
Lisa Feldman Barrett. I have a quote I have to mention my name once every time we talk.

38:29.120 --> 38:33.760
Her work helped me make a lot of progress and then prepared me to understand your work as well.

38:33.760 --> 38:36.480
So I think that's big and I wish more economists were aware of that.

38:39.280 --> 38:46.800
Do you think that the system as a whole is trainable? In other words, is there a notion

38:46.880 --> 38:52.480
of memory here that you could, you know, future behavior, some kind of hysteresis,

38:52.480 --> 38:56.880
historicity, like future behavior would be different based on the history of prior stimuli?

38:58.240 --> 39:03.920
Yes, it's a bit tricky to give a clear answer to this because I think it gets so mixed up with

39:03.920 --> 39:09.440
the trainability of humans and firms. Like the economy is trainable, but that's not surprising

39:09.440 --> 39:14.080
to economists because people are trainable. So there is a great deal of research about how firms

39:14.080 --> 39:17.760
learn and like based on previous instances, they'll then change how they're going to behave

39:17.760 --> 39:25.360
in the future. The trainability of just the price system itself, I suppose it's conceivable that

39:25.360 --> 39:32.480
maybe certain, I don't know, like elasticities might be influenced by past behavior, but I don't

39:32.480 --> 39:36.880
have any specific ideas. So right now I'd say it's a little tricky to disambiguate that

39:37.840 --> 39:42.880
from just the trainability of people and people made organizations such as businesses.

39:43.600 --> 39:48.400
I think we actually, so this might be an interesting thing for us to do some research on

39:48.400 --> 39:53.040
because I think actually you can disambiguate it by analogy to what we did in gene regulatory

39:53.040 --> 39:57.280
networks. So if you have a model of gene regulatory networks, which is just a set of

39:57.280 --> 40:01.360
coupled differential equations that say how each gene turns the other genes on and off,

40:02.160 --> 40:06.880
we showed six different kinds of learning, including pavlovian conditioning in that model,

40:06.880 --> 40:13.520
but specifically the pieces A were completely dumb, so they did not learn. So unlike in what

40:13.520 --> 40:18.880
you're talking about now, the nodes themselves have zero learning capacity, all they have is state,

40:18.880 --> 40:23.440
so they just have whatever their current, they don't have any memory, they don't have any of that,

40:23.440 --> 40:29.760
they just have whatever my current state is, that's all I know. So zero memory. And that's A

40:29.760 --> 40:34.640
and B, what you're also not allowed to do in these models is change the topology of the network. In

40:34.640 --> 40:39.200
other words, how strong are the connections? So the typical things you would do to train a network

40:39.200 --> 40:43.920
like that, which is to adjust the synaptic weight, right? And the connections between the nodes,

40:43.920 --> 40:48.400
you're not allowed to change that, the network is completely fixed. So no intelligence in the

40:48.400 --> 40:56.640
nodes, no changes of the topology. And yet, just from the dynamical systems behavior of that,

40:56.640 --> 41:00.800
of certain not all, it's not a universal thing, the way that you know, some of like, for example,

41:00.880 --> 41:06.640
Stu Kaufman's origins of order in that network stuff is which is just like widely applicable

41:06.640 --> 41:10.880
to random networks. This isn't like that random networks don't do this as well as biological

41:10.880 --> 41:16.160
networks. So I think evolution actually has probably selected for ones that are good at this,

41:16.160 --> 41:21.040
but nevertheless, there are plenty of networks that can learn without with the pieces being

41:21.040 --> 41:26.480
being completely done. So, so I wonder, I wonder if we had an economic model where you clamp so

41:26.560 --> 41:32.560
an in silico computational economic model, you clamp the behavior of the individual so they

41:32.560 --> 41:39.520
cannot learn. Probably we can even we can even clamp the relationships between them. But we

41:39.520 --> 41:45.280
examine the behavior of the system after stimuli that are patterned in the way that behavioral

41:45.280 --> 41:51.040
scientists do it for, you know, for testing habituation sensitization, pathology and conditioning,

41:51.040 --> 41:57.280
whatever. I wonder if we would if we would see learning there my conjecture is that that we would

41:57.280 --> 42:02.480
I think this this my guess is that this is a very widespread capacity. And I think we could

42:02.480 --> 42:06.720
potentially show that if you if you if you clamp, you know, if you clamp the behavior of the individuals.

42:07.920 --> 42:12.000
I'd be inclined to agree because I do just think these systems should be analogous.

42:12.000 --> 42:17.440
I'm wondering now so there's a Nobel Prize winner Vernon Smith who became sort of known for doing

42:17.440 --> 42:22.880
economic experiments which we usually can't do very well. I wonder if there are some analogies

42:22.880 --> 42:26.160
in his work. So maybe I'll try to read up a little bit on the gene regulatory stuff

42:26.960 --> 42:29.920
and see if I can find any connections to anything Vernon Smith has done.

42:30.480 --> 42:35.920
Maybe not, but it's exploring. Yeah, yeah, that's cool. You know, and I wonder as you look at the

42:35.920 --> 42:41.200
GRN stuff, I wonder if we can define, for example, in these networks, what would be the equivalent

42:41.200 --> 42:50.080
of the price? Right? Could we say that by watching their behavior? Actually, how about this? Do you

42:50.080 --> 42:58.480
think that watching it's like a it's like a weird touring test. If if if I showed a bunch of economists

42:59.360 --> 43:05.520
the behavior of some system, some distributed system, could they say that hey, this absolutely

43:05.520 --> 43:10.640
looks like any like an economy or no, it does not. Is that something that or or can you make

43:10.640 --> 43:14.400
anything look like an economy in which case we could actually do the mapping and figure out,

43:14.400 --> 43:18.480
you know, what what does the price? What is the price in this in this GRN?

43:19.760 --> 43:24.560
That's an interesting question. I never thought about that. I suspect that most economists would

43:24.560 --> 43:28.640
just because you know, their academics just be cautious about drawing any conclusions that

43:28.640 --> 43:34.640
haven't been like hard verified. But that's an interesting question. I'd be very interested

43:34.640 --> 43:38.320
in seeing the results. Yeah, I don't know. That's very interesting. It's that's worth exploring for

43:38.320 --> 43:45.280
sure. Yeah, I mean, one one one way to get started with that is if you identify for me,

43:46.080 --> 43:50.560
what does it what does an economic data set look like? That is, what does an economist

43:50.560 --> 43:57.120
fix? So if you were going to say to a colleague, okay, I'm going to show you the the parameters

43:57.120 --> 44:01.200
of this economic system, what do they expect to see? You know, what what does the what does the

44:01.200 --> 44:06.160
data look like? What what what are they looking for? Is it, you know, prices over time or distributed

44:06.240 --> 44:10.880
buys and sells or what are they looking for? I bet if we understood the format of that,

44:10.880 --> 44:16.320
I could give you a data set. I would, you know, we could do a blind thing where I wouldn't tell

44:16.320 --> 44:20.560
you what it really was. You can show it to people and they say, oh, a classic case of,

44:20.560 --> 44:26.240
you know, an economy of this type. And then we could find out that actually this is this is,

44:26.240 --> 44:30.160
you know, a bunch of cells communicating during, I don't know, axial determination or something.

44:30.640 --> 44:36.800
I think I think it would be interesting to to to to use that as a as a way of finding these

44:36.800 --> 44:42.080
kinds of mappings, you know. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. I will look into that. That's a really

44:42.080 --> 44:48.320
good idea. I think that'd be fun. All right. And I guess, okay, the last question that came to my

44:48.320 --> 44:55.600
mind is this, does all of this does everything we've you've said today, assume a perfect efficiency,

44:55.600 --> 45:00.080
like, like, like immediate, you know, instantaneous transfer of information, all that kind of stuff.

45:01.600 --> 45:10.960
No, but of course, you won't, you won't achieve like perfect outcomes without it. But no, you

45:10.960 --> 45:14.080
don't need that to have something that the perfection within a body, but I still feel like

45:14.080 --> 45:19.200
myself. And I believe the same is true of the economy. And then as technology improves, we will,

45:19.200 --> 45:23.840
of course, improve the efficiency of it. Right now, a tremendous amount of people are not terribly

45:23.840 --> 45:28.720
bound into the economy. I mean, billions people are in poverty and so on. And so over time, that

45:28.720 --> 45:33.520
will increase greatly. But yeah, in the first world, like, certainly the stock market or something

45:33.520 --> 45:37.680
like that is bound together tightly enough. I think it's reasonable to think of it this way.

45:39.120 --> 45:43.840
And I'll tell you why I asked, but I'm also thinking about, you know, kind of information

45:43.840 --> 45:48.240
efficiencies, like, you're when you buy and again, I'm I know nothing about economics. So this

45:48.240 --> 45:52.640
could be nonsense. But to me, it seems like when you're when you're when you're when you're

45:53.280 --> 45:57.040
selling something, you want to get rid of it. And you think it's a good idea to get rid of it.

45:57.040 --> 46:00.560
For that to work, somebody else needs to disagree with you and think that it's a good idea to buy

46:00.560 --> 46:05.600
it. And so right, so there are going to be differences in how informed people are. And

46:05.600 --> 46:10.000
somebody's going to make money because they're more informed than somebody else. And, and of course,

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
then people can make bets on what's going to happen with the economy and things like that.

46:14.000 --> 46:18.720
Right. So, so the reason I bring this up is because if you think about, so let's think about

46:18.720 --> 46:23.360
the biological case, you got a, you got a set of cells, and the cells are now coupled by gap

46:23.360 --> 46:29.200
gap junctions, right? Now, so, so that's a kind of cognitive blue, because the biotech signals

46:29.200 --> 46:34.640
are now spreading through the through the continued through the through the tissue. And

46:34.640 --> 46:39.600
it's now harder for any one cell to be an ally or in terms of its memories, and it's a model of

46:39.600 --> 46:45.200
the world because it's sharing physiological parameters exactly directly with its neighbors.

46:45.200 --> 46:50.000
But in the real world, it takes time for information to propagate through that tissue.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.480
And so much like, you know, the speed of light is a kind of like this limit in the in the in

46:54.480 --> 46:59.120
physics that binds the ties together space and time, there's going to be a constant like that

46:59.120 --> 47:04.480
in any tissue that basically tells you how fast can information propagate, right? And how fast it

47:04.480 --> 47:09.760
can, it can can can can signals and information get across the thing. So you're going to have

47:09.760 --> 47:15.680
scenarios where for some amount of time, there are going to be regions. So let's say so, so, so,

47:15.680 --> 47:20.720
so here's your cellular network, your tissue, something happens over here to trigger it,

47:20.720 --> 47:24.320
there's going to be some time where the ones over here know about it and the ones back here don't

47:24.320 --> 47:32.720
yet. So I wonder to what extent, and you can also think about that delta, having something to do

47:32.800 --> 47:37.200
with the thickness of the cognitive now moment, right, that that you're not instantaneous, there's

47:37.200 --> 47:43.040
about a couple of hundred milliseconds in neuroscience, they tell you that that is when when

47:43.040 --> 47:47.280
the things are propagated. And below that, you can't really answer questions. Did I see it? You

47:47.280 --> 47:52.240
know, am I was I aware of it? You only you can only answer those questions from the definitively

47:52.240 --> 47:57.600
from the perspective of the larger, larger cognitive agent from a certain, you know,

47:57.600 --> 48:01.040
after the information has had a chance to propagate and all the subsystems have had their say,

48:01.040 --> 48:05.360
and eventually you can say yes, you did, or you didn't. So there's a temporal resolution,

48:05.360 --> 48:09.840
right, below which you can't really slice yourself that temporal thickness. So I wonder if

48:09.840 --> 48:15.680
something like this is going on here, and I wonder if it's also helpful, if there's any kind of a

48:15.680 --> 48:19.600
helpful mapping, if the things that economists, I assume economists know a lot about what happens

48:19.600 --> 48:26.240
when there are discrepancies in information in the in the economy and ability to act and so on.

48:26.240 --> 48:30.480
I wonder if some of those things could help us understand development or morphogenesis more

48:30.480 --> 48:36.400
roughly. I suspect so. I mean, information asymmetry is a huge field of research where

48:36.400 --> 48:39.600
like you're trading with someone who knows more than you about the good. So you have to ask like,

48:39.600 --> 48:43.280
why are they selling this to me? And that can make it very challenging to create markets.

48:43.920 --> 48:49.440
You also have things like no trade theorems, where like if we're all, you know, trading the

48:49.440 --> 48:53.120
stock market, potentially the only reason you're selling to me is because you think it's going

48:53.120 --> 48:58.400
down. It's like, why would I buy it? So there are instances where differences in information can

48:58.400 --> 49:02.640
really make it very difficult to trade, even though at the same time, the whole point of

49:02.640 --> 49:07.120
trading is to ultimately bring everyone's information into sync with each other. So yes,

49:07.120 --> 49:12.240
there is a tremendous amount of research about that in both finance and information asymmetry,

49:12.240 --> 49:30.480
economics. That's absolutely something that could be incorporated in some way.

49:32.400 --> 49:37.120
Okay, yeah, the Wi-Fi is really good. Maybe I cut out again. Yeah, yeah, it's really

49:37.200 --> 49:43.440
accurate. I guess the last thing I'll just suggest, and this is something we can do in later work,

49:43.440 --> 49:47.760
is like I think you've painted an amazing picture of the parallels between the two systems.

49:47.760 --> 49:53.360
And I think the other complementary thing we can do is look at the parallels of the disorders.

49:53.360 --> 50:04.800
Yeah, so the various ways that economics goes bad and has various breakdowns of optimal functioning.

50:04.800 --> 50:11.440
I wonder if we can map that onto specific disorders in other spaces in living systems.

50:11.440 --> 50:15.680
I wonder if there's a version of, I don't know, developmental defects, cancer,

50:16.320 --> 50:22.480
failure to repair, all those kinds of things. Yeah, I think cancer is an externality,

50:22.480 --> 50:27.520
and externality is sort of the generalization of all of those issues. Currently, economists

50:27.520 --> 50:32.560
have a very hard time talking about externality. It's actually hard to make it consistent with

50:32.640 --> 50:36.960
economics. So I have a paper on my website talking about that issue, actually citing some of your

50:36.960 --> 50:41.200
work as to how we could try to make progress on that. So I believe those parallels are definitely

50:41.200 --> 50:45.920
there, and I have been thinking about it. And what we might actually need is biologists to

50:45.920 --> 50:50.400
figure out cancer and then use that so we can solve externality. So the direction might flow that way.

50:51.120 --> 50:56.320
Yeah, I think that's very interesting to think about which direction, probably both, but the

50:56.320 --> 51:01.920
insights could flow. I mean, we've had some luck normalizing cancer, at least in the amphibian

51:01.920 --> 51:06.400
models, we're moving on to mammals now, and to human cells now, but we've had some really good

51:06.400 --> 51:11.920
luck in frog models. So we could think about what that might be. But I think in general, some

51:13.680 --> 51:18.480
research that we could do together would be to get hold of a computational model. I assume

51:18.480 --> 51:26.480
there are computer models of simple or maybe not simple economic systems that people can play with.

51:27.440 --> 51:32.080
So actually, computational models have not been huge in economics because they haven't been able

51:32.080 --> 51:36.400
to tell us anything that's surprising. And so actually, what I've been thinking about, because

51:36.400 --> 51:41.040
you mentioned this before, is maybe they could make like a comeback, because it would be surprising

51:41.040 --> 51:47.200
just to see economics in biology. And so I'm not familiar at all with computational economics,

51:47.200 --> 51:52.960
but I do believe that is a very useful path. And relatedly, one thing I've been thinking about is

51:53.040 --> 51:57.680
there's a field called economic geography, which explains like why does finance end up in New

51:57.680 --> 52:02.000
York and like tech end up in San Francisco. I think that could be useful for explaining like

52:02.000 --> 52:06.080
why does your heart end up here and like your kidney end up where it is. So I think computational

52:06.080 --> 52:10.400
models could be interesting in that context, but I currently don't know anything about them. So I

52:10.400 --> 52:14.000
definitely have to do some studying. Yeah, let me know what you what you turn up. I think it would

52:14.000 --> 52:18.240
be cool. I mean, I remember, you know, from 100 years ago, like lemonade stand, right? Like you

52:18.560 --> 52:23.440
could easily something as simple as that. And probably that one, I'm guessing is too simple,

52:23.440 --> 52:28.400
but there must be things for students to play with. And that where if we, if we, you know, rip

52:28.400 --> 52:33.680
the graphic interface off of it and use the underlying computations, we could test things like

52:33.680 --> 52:39.760
can we can we induce and repair various disorders in the biology focus way? Can we try the learning

52:39.760 --> 52:45.200
and the training? Can we use it to generate data sets to compare to other things and see if

52:45.440 --> 52:48.320
economists can actually pick out which one's the economy and which one's the

52:48.880 --> 52:52.320
morphogenetic signaling, all those things. I think we should we should look into it.

52:53.040 --> 52:55.200
Absolutely. I think so too. Yeah, that'd be super cool.
