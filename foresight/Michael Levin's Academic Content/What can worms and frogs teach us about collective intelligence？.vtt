WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.600
Thank you so much. That's very kind. And it's been a real honor and a privilege to get to

00:12.600 --> 00:17.760
know Bill and work together on these projects. So thank you for inviting me here. This is

00:17.760 --> 00:21.960
a new kind of audience for me. And I've put together a talk that I haven't given before.

00:21.960 --> 00:27.720
So let's see how it goes. By the way, if anybody's interested afterwards in the details, all

00:27.720 --> 00:33.080
of the sort of official peer-reviewed kind of stuff, the software, the papers, everything is

00:33.080 --> 00:38.400
here. And then here are sort of a little bit more personal thoughts about what I think it all means

00:38.400 --> 00:45.040
and things like that. So let's begin here. This is a well-known painting. It's called Adam Names

00:45.040 --> 00:50.480
the Animals in the Garden of Eden. And there are two interesting things about this old story.

00:50.480 --> 00:56.880
One of them, I think, is needs to really be redone and ditched. And the other one is very

00:56.920 --> 01:01.320
profound. And I think it's going to be important for us going forward. The one that needs to be

01:01.320 --> 01:06.320
dropped is this idea here that there are discrete natural kinds of beings. We know what they are.

01:06.320 --> 01:14.120
Here are these large, mostly cute sorts of animals. There's Adam. We know what they are.

01:14.120 --> 01:17.040
They're discrete. They're different from each other. Adam, of course, is different from all of

01:17.040 --> 01:24.320
them. And that, as you're going to see in a minute, does not do justice to the incredible plasticity

01:24.320 --> 01:30.280
of life. Our attempts to bin it into these categories is not going to fly. What is really

01:30.280 --> 01:36.440
profound here, I think, is that in that original story, you may or may not know that neither God

01:36.440 --> 01:41.000
nor the angels were able to name the animals. It was Adam that had to do it. The job was on him.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.360
And there are a couple of reasons why that might be. One is because in these old traditions,

01:46.360 --> 01:50.720
naming something or discovering the name of something means you've discovered something about

01:50.720 --> 01:55.560
its true inner nature. And I think that's important because we, as humans, are going to have to

01:55.560 --> 02:01.480
discover the inner nature of a very wide set of beings that Adam could not even have begun to dream

02:01.480 --> 02:06.200
of. The other thing is, of course, Adam's the one that has to live with them. And so his understanding

02:06.200 --> 02:11.800
of his world and the other beings around it is going to be critical for him to develop. So I

02:11.800 --> 02:18.160
want to talk about a few things today. First is some thoughts on information, evolution, and

02:18.160 --> 02:23.200
selves, this notion of collective intelligence and where it comes from. I want to talk about the

02:23.200 --> 02:29.040
paradox of change and how biology handles it. Now, the paradox of change can be said as follows.

02:29.040 --> 02:35.320
This is scaled to the level of evolution, but I think you will see the obvious implications for

02:35.320 --> 02:41.600
personal and possibly company growth and things like that. The paradox is this, if you're a species

02:41.600 --> 02:48.000
and you fail to change, you're going to go extinct. But if you do change, you likewise will, in an

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
important sense, cease to exist. So what does that mean? How do we, as beings, preserve ourselves in

02:54.000 --> 02:59.640
some sense as we inevitably change? We change physically, we change mentally. If you don't

02:59.640 --> 03:04.720
change mentally, you can't learn. So there's some sense in which profound educational process changes

03:04.720 --> 03:09.200
you so that you're not the same, certainly growing up, but we'll do that and so on. So this is a

03:09.200 --> 03:14.640
really interesting paradox and I'm going to show you how I think biology handles it. And we're

03:14.960 --> 03:21.920
going to talk about a few other topics such as plasticity, diverse intelligence, and creative

03:21.920 --> 03:28.880
interpretation, a.k.a. polycomputing that biology uses across scales. And we're going to look at it,

03:29.360 --> 03:34.320
we're going to start our journey here through the eyes of a frog with an eye on its butt. Now,

03:34.880 --> 03:38.400
if anybody asks you in the future, have you ever seen a frog with an eye on its butt, now you can

03:38.400 --> 03:44.080
say yes. This is a frog we have made in our lab. This is not Photoshop. This is not AI. This is

03:44.720 --> 03:49.200
a real eye on its butt. And the reason that these kinds of things are possible is because

03:49.200 --> 03:56.000
biology commits to a certain kind of creative process to solve this problem. The way the way

03:56.000 --> 04:01.120
that frog came to be is that we took a tadpole. So here's a tadpole, here's the brain, the nostrils,

04:01.120 --> 04:07.760
the mouth, the gut, the tail. And what we did was we put some eyes, some eye cell precursor cells

04:07.760 --> 04:13.120
on the back of this tadpole. The cells go ahead and they make an eye. I'll tell you another story

04:13.120 --> 04:18.240
about ectopic eyes in a minute, but that's how we did this is by transplantation. You'll also

04:18.240 --> 04:22.800
note that he doesn't have any primary eyes. So we prevented those from forming, but we put an eye on

04:22.800 --> 04:28.480
his tail. And then we built this machine. This was an incredible ordeal. It took probably five

04:28.480 --> 04:34.400
years, about a million bucks, which is huge for a lab, to build this kind of thing. And what the

04:34.400 --> 04:40.080
machine does is test these tadpoles in visual assays. So basically, there's a little spot of

04:40.080 --> 04:46.880
light and they have to either chase or stay away from the moving light in order to succeed in that

04:46.880 --> 04:51.120
task. And we found out that they can see quite well. These eyes on their backs enable them to

04:51.120 --> 04:55.520
see perfectly well. By the way, here's the optic nerve. You can trace it. It does not go to the

04:55.520 --> 05:00.720
brain. It goes to the spinal cord and then it stops there. So notice what's happened here is that

05:00.720 --> 05:05.920
this animal has a radically different sensory motor architecture. You've got now this weird itchy

05:05.920 --> 05:10.400
patch of tissue on your back that's sending signals to your spinal cord. How does the brain know that

05:10.400 --> 05:16.400
that's visual data and use it? And in particular, why doesn't that take extra evolutionary cycles?

05:16.400 --> 05:21.280
You know, cycles of mutation, selection, it's just ready to roll. You've drastically changed

05:21.280 --> 05:25.760
this architecture that's been the same for millions of years and suddenly it works. And it

05:25.760 --> 05:31.360
works because evolution doesn't actually make specific solutions to specific problems. It makes

05:31.360 --> 05:37.680
problem-solving agents. And embryos, as I'll point out in a few minutes, can't take much for

05:37.680 --> 05:43.360
granted. They solve these things on the fly, which is why this works. Now, what this has to do with

05:43.360 --> 05:54.160
collective intelligence is this. We all started life right here as a single cell. I once pointed

05:54.160 --> 06:00.160
out to somebody, I was doing some expert witness work and they were trying to, one of the attorneys

06:00.160 --> 06:06.160
was trying to say that our work in frog was not relevant to humans. And he said, don't frogs come

06:06.160 --> 06:10.400
from an egg? I said, will you come from an egg? And this was like everybody thought I was insulting

06:10.400 --> 06:15.120
him, you know, the judge bang the thing. But let's remember, we all come from an egg. We all come

06:15.120 --> 06:20.960
from a single cell. And that's a little blob of chemistry and physics. And that slowly and gradually

06:21.600 --> 06:28.640
gives rise to one of these remarkable morphologies. And there is no magic spot, no lightning flash

06:28.640 --> 06:33.520
that says, okay, you wore physics, but now you're a real cognitive individual. Now, mind comes into

06:33.520 --> 06:40.080
the picture. This is slow and gradual. So we, then as scientists and philosophers, do need to understand

06:40.080 --> 06:44.080
how does that scaling work? How do you get from a system that's well-described by chemistry and

06:44.080 --> 06:50.480
physics? And as I'll mention, actually, not with zero cognitive capacity, it's small, but it's not

06:50.480 --> 06:57.680
zero. How do you get here? And let's remember that we humans with our magical, agential glow

06:57.760 --> 07:03.280
are not discreetly different from all of these other things. We stand at the intersection of two

07:03.280 --> 07:10.480
enormous continuums where you can both, both evolutionarily and developmentally. And then,

07:10.480 --> 07:14.560
you know, through biological change and through technological change, there are all kinds of

07:14.560 --> 07:20.880
interesting beings that we're going to need to get to know. So that's a little disturbing. And a lot

07:20.880 --> 07:25.440
of people, a lot of people, they send me emails about how disturbed they are to find out that

07:25.440 --> 07:30.880
they were basically a scale up from a single cell. But at least we're a true unified intelligence,

07:30.880 --> 07:35.920
right? So like we're not like a collection of ants or termites or something that you can talk

07:35.920 --> 07:40.320
about an ant colony as a collective intelligence, but we're an actual true unified intelligence,

07:40.320 --> 07:47.680
right? Well, wrong. So this is Descartes, who really liked the pineal gland. And the reason

07:47.680 --> 07:51.760
he liked the pineal gland is that there's only one of them in the brain. And he felt that our

07:51.760 --> 07:57.200
unified human experience should be associated with a structure in the brain. That's unique, not

07:57.200 --> 08:01.840
bifurcated, not to like the hemispheres or all these other structures. It should be the only one.

08:01.840 --> 08:06.960
Well, if he had had access to good microscopy, he would have looked inside the pineal gland and

08:06.960 --> 08:10.640
you would have seen that, wait a minute, there's not one of anything. It's made of a bunch of cells.

08:10.640 --> 08:15.680
Each one of these cells has all this stuff in it. So look at this. These are all the things that are

08:15.680 --> 08:20.800
inside of each cell. And there's plenty more. This is only what we know to stain at this point.

08:20.800 --> 08:27.280
And so all intelligence is collective intelligence. We are all built of a kind of multi-scale

08:27.280 --> 08:32.240
agential material. This is a single cell. This happens to be a free living organism known as

08:32.240 --> 08:36.880
a lacrimaria. But look, this is what a single cell can do. There's no brain. There's no nervous

08:36.880 --> 08:44.240
system. He's handling all of his local needs with, and this is real time. So incredible anatomical,

08:44.240 --> 08:52.480
physiological, and metabolic control and so on. And so we're all made of collections of these.

08:52.480 --> 08:56.480
And the thing about being a collective intelligence is that you need cognitive glue.

08:56.480 --> 09:01.920
Now what I mean by that is, here's a rat that's been trained to press a lever, get a reward.

09:01.920 --> 09:06.400
There is no single cell here that has had both experiences. So the cells at the bottom of the

09:06.400 --> 09:12.080
feet interacted with the lever. The cells in the gut got the delicious sugar reward. But no single

09:12.080 --> 09:17.200
cell had both of these experiences. So who owns the associative memory? Who is it that knows that

09:17.200 --> 09:23.120
these two things are tied? It isn't any individual cell. It is the rat. So you've got this. You've

09:23.120 --> 09:30.720
got what you need is a set of mechanisms that are able to provide the system with memories,

09:30.720 --> 09:35.440
preferences, goals, and other cognitive properties that the individual parts don't have.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.320
Now we're used to thinking about ones like this, and creatures like this are fairly,

09:43.920 --> 09:49.120
the rat doesn't change too much, but there are many other creatures that show us something

09:49.120 --> 09:56.320
really remarkable. So here are some flatworms, some plenarium. You can train them to understand

09:56.320 --> 10:01.120
that these little bumpy circles that we've laser etched into the bottom of the dish are where they

10:01.120 --> 10:06.160
get fed. So the liver shows up on these little circles. The other amazing thing about plenaria

10:06.160 --> 10:11.520
is that they regenerate. So you can cut them into pieces. The record is something like 276 pieces,

10:12.080 --> 10:16.960
and if you cut them in half here, this tail will sit there doing nothing for about eight days. It'll

10:16.960 --> 10:21.600
grow a new head, and then behavior begins, and you find out that these animals remember the

10:21.600 --> 10:26.800
original information. So the information is not exclusively in the brain because you can cut off

10:26.800 --> 10:34.320
the entire head. It is somewhere else. However, it is imprinted onto the new brain as it develops.

10:34.320 --> 10:38.960
And so you can do all kinds of interesting thought experiments, like the old malfunctioning

10:38.960 --> 10:43.280
transporter, and ask, okay, if we cut them into pieces, who's the original plenaria, and so on.

10:43.280 --> 10:48.640
So right away you get into these issues of personal identity. You get into where is behavioral

10:48.640 --> 10:53.360
information? How does it move through the body? How does it imprint it onto new brains? How do

10:53.360 --> 10:58.000
brains know how to interpret? Just like I showed you in the tadpole, the brain knows how to interpret

10:58.000 --> 11:03.440
information coming off of its spinal cord. How does this brain know that whatever the tail is

11:03.440 --> 11:09.040
telling it is actually behavioral information that the brain can use? But it goes even beyond that.

11:09.680 --> 11:15.280
It's not just about maintaining the information. Here's one of my favorite examples. So here's

11:15.280 --> 11:19.920
a caterpillar, two-dimensional. You can model it as a soft-bodied robot with a particular

11:19.920 --> 11:25.360
controller, and that's suitable for moving soft bodies that have no hard elements, so you can't

11:25.360 --> 11:29.760
push on anything. So these things crawl around and they eat leaves, and they have a brain that's

11:29.760 --> 11:34.960
well suited for that. They have to turn into this. This is a butterfly that flies in three-dimensional

11:34.960 --> 11:40.640
space, doesn't eat leaves, it drinks nectar. And in order to change the brain from this to that,

11:40.640 --> 11:45.840
you basically undergo this remarkable transformation process that dissolves most of the brain.

11:45.840 --> 11:50.000
Many of the cells die, most of the connections are broken, but what you find out is that if you

11:50.000 --> 11:56.560
train the caterpillar to seek out leaves on a particular color disc, the butterfly will do

11:56.560 --> 12:00.640
the same. Now there's a few amazing things here. You can ask questions like, what's it like to be

12:00.640 --> 12:06.800
a creature in the process of changing so radically? Questions like that, and you can ask where is

12:06.800 --> 12:10.800
the memory? If the brain is being refactored, where does it keep those memories? But there's a

12:10.800 --> 12:18.160
deeper issue here, which is that butterflies don't eat the same stuff that caterpillars eat,

12:18.160 --> 12:23.760
and they don't move the same way the caterpillars move. So having the exact memories of a caterpillar

12:23.760 --> 12:29.920
is completely useless. What it has to do actually is interpret whatever the engrams, whatever the

12:29.920 --> 12:37.040
memory traces that the caterpillar leaves, it has to reinterpret them for its new context. So in its

12:37.040 --> 12:42.480
new higher dimensional life, it doesn't carry the exact memories of its previous life, but it

12:42.480 --> 12:47.360
carries the deep lessons that it's learned. And the trick here is that it has to know how to

12:48.320 --> 12:54.080
remap them onto its own architecture. So you can read a lot more about this in this preprint

12:54.080 --> 13:01.520
that I just put up a few days ago. So the interesting thing is that these worms and

13:01.520 --> 13:06.880
caterpillars and so on, we shouldn't just think about them as this sort of bizarre

13:06.880 --> 13:14.000
aspect of biology that has nothing to do with us. Because if you think about the slices of

13:14.000 --> 13:19.440
our own life at any given moment, you don't have access to the past. The only thing you have access

13:19.440 --> 13:26.080
to are the engrams, the traces of past experience that your past self has laid down in your brain,

13:26.080 --> 13:32.560
in your body, in notepads, in various outsourced kinds of things. You have to reinterpret those

13:32.560 --> 13:38.240
memories at every point. You have to reconstruct actively the story of who you are, what you are,

13:38.960 --> 13:45.200
what your various commitments and beliefs are from the molecules and the energy patterns that are

13:45.200 --> 13:49.600
in your body. And you have to tell a story about what they add up to. This is what our brain does

13:49.600 --> 13:54.960
all the time. One way to think about this is that memories are messages from your past self.

13:55.680 --> 14:00.240
Just the way that you exchange messages laterally with other beings at your current

14:00.240 --> 14:06.880
time point. These memories are messages from a past self. And like any act of communication,

14:06.880 --> 14:11.840
you're not actually required to interpret these messages in the way that the sender intended.

14:11.840 --> 14:16.800
You are free to reinterpret them, however it's best for you. And not only are you free to do that,

14:16.800 --> 14:20.880
you actually have to do that because you will change. Your body will change, the environment

14:20.880 --> 14:27.280
changes. Even for humans, there's turnover. There's molecular turnover and cellular turnover

14:27.280 --> 14:32.480
all the time. So all of these messages have to be turned over. And the way that this works,

14:32.480 --> 14:41.440
you can imagine that these engrams, these memory traces are like this middle node, this narrow

14:41.440 --> 14:45.600
little middle node in what this is probably familiar to many of you, this kind of

14:45.600 --> 14:53.680
this architecture that's used like an autoencoder kind of thing where it squeezes down

14:54.480 --> 14:58.880
all of the information that's come before because you don't want it to remember the exact data.

14:58.880 --> 15:03.280
You want it to remember patterns. And then you pass the bottleneck, you want this side to

15:03.280 --> 15:09.040
reinflate those patterns into whatever makes sense on the other end. Biology has this everywhere in

15:09.040 --> 15:14.000
gene regulatory networks and voltage at the center of bioelectrical circuits in biomechanical

15:14.000 --> 15:19.760
networks. This architecture is absolutely everywhere because this is what enables information to

15:19.760 --> 15:25.600
preserve salience, not accuracy, but salience and utility on the other end. Now this will only work

15:25.600 --> 15:35.360
if the two ends of this thing are smart. They have to undertake some effort to interpret

15:35.360 --> 15:43.120
and encode what's going on here. So our bodies are made of a multi-scale competency architecture.

15:43.120 --> 15:49.680
Every level of this is in fact smart in the sense that it has a competency to solve various problems.

15:49.680 --> 15:54.960
So whole bodies of course solve problems in three-dimensional space, various kinds of behaviors,

15:54.960 --> 16:01.920
but your molecular networks, your subcellular organelles, your cellular components, your organs,

16:01.920 --> 16:07.040
tissues, all of these things solve problems in other kinds of spaces. And in fact, one thing

16:07.040 --> 16:14.240
that evolution has done is to pivot some of the same tools and tricks for navigating problem spaces

16:14.240 --> 16:18.480
across these various spaces. So we started off metabolic space and then physiological space and

16:18.480 --> 16:23.120
then genes came along and you could navigate gene expression space and then multicellularity came

16:23.120 --> 16:29.040
along and you could navigate anatomical space, the space of possible large-scale shapes. And then,

16:29.040 --> 16:32.960
of course, brains and muscles showed up and you could do behavioral space and then eventually

16:32.960 --> 16:37.680
linguistic space. And it turns out from some recent work in our group that actually some of

16:37.680 --> 16:44.720
the exact same ideas from navigating these other spaces you can use to help AIs navigate linguistic

16:44.720 --> 16:52.480
space and keep track of a story longer and longer and so on. So Alan Turing, who obviously needs

16:52.480 --> 16:58.800
no introduction, who was very interested in minds and intelligence and different embodiments of

16:58.800 --> 17:04.480
intelligence and machines and so on, he was studying intelligence through reprogrammability,

17:04.480 --> 17:09.200
right? He was interested in programmable hardware and plasticity. Interestingly,

17:09.760 --> 17:15.280
he wrote this paper, The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis. It's one of the earliest works on

17:15.280 --> 17:20.800
the mathematics of how order might arise in chemical systems like that egg that I showed you.

17:20.800 --> 17:27.120
So he was interested how do you, how does the egg self-assemble? How do the chemicals assume

17:27.120 --> 17:31.760
some sort of order? Now, why would somebody who was interested in mathematics and computer science

17:31.760 --> 17:37.760
and so on be interested in this question? And I think that he saw a very profound kind of

17:38.560 --> 17:43.360
invariance that I think if he had lived longer, both biology and computer science would be much

17:43.360 --> 17:50.080
further along because what he realized was that the story of the appearance of minds is fundamentally

17:50.080 --> 17:55.440
the same story as the story of the self-assembly of the body, right? The factors that put together

17:55.440 --> 18:00.400
your body should be really important for understanding where minds come from. So let's

18:00.400 --> 18:05.600
ask where do anatomies come from? So you start life as a collection of embryonic blastomeres.

18:05.600 --> 18:10.240
This is a cross-section through an adult human. Look at the amazing order. All of the organs,

18:10.240 --> 18:13.920
they're the right size, the right shape. Everything is next to the correct thing.

18:14.800 --> 18:20.880
Where does this amazing order come from? Where is this pattern written down? And so if you ask,

18:20.880 --> 18:25.520
even nine-year-olds, I've given talks to middle schools and they will immediately say, well,

18:25.520 --> 18:30.320
it's in the DNA. It's in the genome. But the thing is that we can read genomes now. And actually,

18:30.320 --> 18:34.880
this was apparent long before, but now we know for sure because we can read genomes. None of this

18:34.880 --> 18:41.360
is directly in the genome. What's in the genome are the specifications of the proteins, the tiniest

18:41.360 --> 18:46.800
hardware, the molecular hardware that cells get to have. This pattern, any more than the actual

18:46.880 --> 18:52.560
structure of the termite colony or the precise pattern of a spider web are not in their genome.

18:52.560 --> 18:56.800
This is not directly in our genome either. Where this comes from is the working out of

18:56.800 --> 19:03.280
the physiological software that this hardware enables. And so we have to ask a number of questions.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.400
Given that DNA specifies the hardware, where does the anatomy come from? How do cells know

19:08.400 --> 19:13.120
what to make and when to stop? If a piece is missing, people like us want to know how do you

19:13.120 --> 19:19.760
repair it? How do you convince them to regrow what they need to regrow? And as engineers,

19:19.760 --> 19:23.440
we also ask, well, what else are they willing to do if we knew how to communicate with them?

19:23.440 --> 19:28.800
And I could do a whole thing here on the anatomical compiler and some of those ideas.

19:28.800 --> 19:33.280
But if we knew how to communicate with these cells, what else would they be willing to build?

19:33.280 --> 19:35.840
And I'm going to show you some of those towards the end of the talk.

19:35.840 --> 19:41.040
Now, one cool thing about this process is that it's not hardwired. This is not simply the emergence

19:41.040 --> 19:46.480
of complexity. This is actually the emergence of intelligence. What kind of intelligence? Well,

19:46.480 --> 19:51.600
goal-directedness of a certain kind in anatomical space. So here, this is an amazing creature,

19:51.600 --> 19:57.760
this axolotl. And they regenerate their limbs, their eyes, their jaws, portions of the brain

19:57.760 --> 20:01.760
and heart and so on. And if they lose a limb, and they do this all the time, they bite each other's

20:01.760 --> 20:07.600
legs off constantly, wherever they lose the limb, the cells will work very hard to build exactly

20:07.600 --> 20:11.440
what's needed, and then they stop. And that's the most amazing thing about this process is they

20:11.440 --> 20:16.960
know when to stop. How do they know when to stop? Well, they stop when the correct axolotl arm has

20:16.960 --> 20:21.840
been completed. It's a process of anatomical homeostasis. If you deviate them from their goal,

20:21.840 --> 20:27.920
they will get right back there and then they stop. By the way, this is not just for weird organisms.

20:29.360 --> 20:32.320
Mammals are a little bit regenerative, so humans can regenerate their liver.

20:33.280 --> 20:39.680
Kids up to a certain age can regenerate their fingertips. And deer can regenerate bone

20:39.680 --> 20:44.560
and vasculature and innervation up to a centimeter and a half per day of new growth when they're

20:44.560 --> 20:48.960
doing this. So we have some of these capacities, but not terribly much. And I want to show you

20:48.960 --> 20:55.360
one of my favorite examples of this kind of intelligence and what it means to be a being

20:55.360 --> 21:01.920
coming into this world. This is a cross-section through a kidney tubule in the in the in the

21:01.920 --> 21:08.240
nude. So normally it's made of eight to ten cells or so. But one trick you can do is by

21:09.600 --> 21:14.640
increasing the number of nuclei of actually genetic material in these cells, you can make

21:14.640 --> 21:18.000
the cells much larger. So the cells will scale to the amount of genetic material,

21:18.720 --> 21:23.520
but the nude stays the same size. And the only way you can do that is by using fewer cells to

21:23.520 --> 21:29.520
build the same structure. And so the first amazing thing is that you could have extra copies of all

21:29.520 --> 21:35.360
your genetic material. No problems. Everything still works. Second, you can have huge cells,

21:35.360 --> 21:40.080
and you will scale the number appropriately. No problem. The most amazing thing happens when

21:40.080 --> 21:45.200
you make truly enormous cells. And at that point, one cell will just bend around itself and give you

21:45.200 --> 21:49.680
that same lumen. Now this is a completely different molecular mechanism than this. This is cell to

21:49.680 --> 21:55.120
cell communication. This is cytoskeletal bending. So this is top-down causation. In the service of a

21:55.120 --> 22:00.640
particular journey and anatomical space that that this system needs to make, it can use different

22:00.640 --> 22:05.680
tools in its disposal. It can use different molecular tools to get the job done. And we can ask all

22:05.680 --> 22:11.440
kinds of interesting questions about how did it know that that was the thing to do? But just think

22:11.440 --> 22:16.720
about what it means to be a nude coming into this world. You can't depend on anything. Never mind the

22:16.720 --> 22:21.760
environment. Never mind the injury that somebody else might come along and bite your leg off or

22:21.760 --> 22:27.040
something. You can't even count on your own parts. You don't know how many copies of your chromosomes

22:27.040 --> 22:30.400
you're going to have. You don't know what the size of your cells are going to be. You don't know how

22:30.400 --> 22:35.600
many cells you're going to have. You have to come in and on the fly, you have to take this journey

22:35.600 --> 22:41.360
in anatomical space, and you can't overtrain on your evolutionary priors. You cannot assume any of

22:41.360 --> 22:46.080
the things that were true in evolution going back. Not just about the environment, but about

22:46.080 --> 22:52.640
yourself. So a very long story, very short. We've been studying how all these things work, and what

22:52.640 --> 22:59.120
we basically found out is that the capacities of brains and nervous systems for dealing with novelty,

22:59.120 --> 23:04.480
for intelligence, for navigation, for keeping memories and pursuing goals and all of that,

23:05.120 --> 23:09.680
those capacities are actually incredibly ancient. They're driven by a kind of

23:09.680 --> 23:15.680
electrophysiological software that is produced in the brain by these little ion channels

23:16.720 --> 23:20.080
that set voltages, and these voltages can propagate through the network, and you get

23:20.080 --> 23:24.800
this electrical activity that you can imagine going on in the brain. But that mechanism is

23:24.800 --> 23:29.840
extremely ancient. It's not really specific to brains at all. Evolution discovered it about

23:29.840 --> 23:35.920
the time of bacterial biofilm, so very long ago. And all cells have these ion channels,

23:35.920 --> 23:40.720
most cells have these electrical synapses. Your whole body is a giant electrical network

23:40.720 --> 23:45.840
that has many of the capacities that your brain has, but it does them slower. So if you take almost

23:45.840 --> 23:50.800
any neuroscience paper, and you just do a find, replace, and in fact, we made an AI system to

23:50.800 --> 23:55.440
do just this for people, it basically flips some words around, you know, if instead of neuron,

23:55.440 --> 24:00.000
you say cell, and instead of millisecond, you say hour, you basically get a pretty reasonable

24:00.000 --> 24:05.520
developmental biology paper about how, whereas your brain thinks about moving you in three

24:05.520 --> 24:10.320
dimensional and now linguistic space, the rest of your body has been thinking about how to move

24:10.320 --> 24:15.040
you through anatomical space from being an egg to being, you know, whatever, whatever we become.

24:15.760 --> 24:20.320
So I just want to show you a small piece of what happens when we understand something like this.

24:20.320 --> 24:25.280
This is, this, these electrical networks are literally the cognitive medium of the

24:25.280 --> 24:29.840
collective intelligence of your body cells, whereas you are the product of the collective

24:29.840 --> 24:34.160
intelligence of your neurons, your body is the product of the collective intelligence of the

24:34.160 --> 24:39.440
rest of your cells behaving in anatomical space. And when we learn this interface,

24:40.240 --> 24:45.920
this bioelectrical interface, we get access to an API that's very, very powerful. Here's one

24:45.920 --> 24:50.400
example. And by the way, just to say none of this has to do with applied electric fields,

24:50.400 --> 24:55.280
there are no electrodes, no magnets, no waves or frequencies or anything like that. We're hacking

24:55.280 --> 25:00.080
the natural interface that cells use to shape each other's behavior, which is the set of ion

25:00.080 --> 25:07.440
channels and gap junctions on their surface. And so, so we can, we can, for example, insert

25:07.440 --> 25:12.320
some, some potassium channel proteins here to create a particular voltage pattern. And that

25:12.320 --> 25:16.800
voltage pattern is a signal to these cells. And what these cells will do is build an eye. This

25:16.800 --> 25:21.040
is not like the eye I showed you before, that was a transplant. This is not like that. We have said

25:21.040 --> 25:25.600
to these cells, which normally make a gut, we've said, here's a particular voltage pattern. It's,

25:25.600 --> 25:29.680
it happens to be the same pattern that they normally use to make an eye. And the cells see it,

25:29.680 --> 25:33.760
and they build an eye. Okay. And these eyes, if you section them, have the same lens, retina,

25:33.760 --> 25:37.520
optic nerve, all this stuff. Now notice a couple of interesting things. First of all,

25:37.520 --> 25:41.920
like any good subroutine call, we did not have to give it all the information on how to build an

25:41.920 --> 25:45.360
eye. In fact, we don't have any idea of how to build an eye. We don't know how to talk to all the

25:45.360 --> 25:50.800
stem cells, all the genes that are there that have to be turned on eyes very complex. And we don't

25:50.800 --> 25:57.920
want to, we want a high level stimulus that prompts the cells to do what they already know

25:57.920 --> 26:02.960
how to do. So that's the first thing. The second thing is, here, this is, this is a lens sitting

26:02.960 --> 26:07.440
out in the flank of a tadpole somewhere. The blue cells are the ones that we actually injected

26:07.440 --> 26:11.840
with our ion channel, but there's not enough of them to make an eye. And so what they've done is

26:11.840 --> 26:16.880
they've recruited all these other normal cells to participate with them to be an eye. And in fact,

26:16.880 --> 26:22.400
we've studied, there's a conversation that happens, these blue cells acquire a new belief. They believe

26:22.400 --> 26:26.400
that they should be an eye and they tell all the other cells, hey, you should be working with us

26:26.400 --> 26:30.880
to make an eye. These other cells, actually, what are they saying? They're saying, no, we should be

26:30.880 --> 26:36.640
skin or gut or whatever. And so they have this back and forth conversation. And sometimes these guys

26:36.640 --> 26:42.160
win and you get an eye. And sometimes the rest of the cells win and they ignore us and stay whatever

26:42.160 --> 26:47.120
tissue they're supposed to be. There are other collective intelligences like ants that do this

26:47.120 --> 26:51.360
when, you know, two ants or a couple of ants discover something that it's too big for them to

26:51.360 --> 26:55.840
carry by themselves. They recruit their neighbors. So all these competencies, you know, this ability

26:55.920 --> 27:01.840
to hold a goal in anatomical space to try to convince others of your goal to get buy into your

27:01.840 --> 27:06.320
story about what should happen and sometimes you win and sometimes you lose that battle. All of these

27:06.320 --> 27:11.440
are native competencies of the tissue. We didn't have to build in any of that. It's already there.

27:11.440 --> 27:16.160
And in the plan area, I told you that they regenerate. And if you cut off the head and the tail,

27:16.160 --> 27:21.440
this middle piece will reliably regenerate this normal worm with the right number of heads.

27:21.440 --> 27:25.600
Here's the bioelectric pattern memory. This is now, we're literally seeing the memories.

27:25.600 --> 27:30.160
Think of it as a brain scan, except not in the brain. We're literally seeing the

27:32.560 --> 27:37.680
representations in this tissue of how many heads a normal planarian should have. So we can go ahead

27:37.680 --> 27:40.960
and change them. We have the technology instead of one head, we can say, no, you should have two

27:40.960 --> 27:46.320
heads. And here's a perfectly normal animal whose tissues, not the animal itself, not the brain,

27:46.320 --> 27:55.120
but the tissues have been incepted with a new memory that says that if you should get cut in

27:55.120 --> 27:59.440
the future, so this is a counterfactual. It's not true now, but if you get cut in the future,

27:59.440 --> 28:03.040
a proper worm should have two heads. And so if you cut that worm, this is what you get. And

28:03.040 --> 28:09.920
again, not Photoshop. These are real. So a single worm body, a perfectly normal and anatomically

28:09.920 --> 28:15.760
normal worm body can store at least two different ideas of what it will do in the future if it

28:15.760 --> 28:20.400
should happen to get injured. And the reason I call this a pattern memory, it's a memory of the

28:20.400 --> 28:25.360
collective intelligence of the body. The reason I call it a memory is because if you then go ahead

28:25.360 --> 28:32.080
and you cut these two headed worms in perpetuity, they maintain two headedness with no more change.

28:32.080 --> 28:37.040
And so this has all the properties of memory. It's stable, but it's rewritable. By the way,

28:37.040 --> 28:41.600
not genetic. We haven't touched the genetics. The genetics are completely untouched. So the

28:41.600 --> 28:48.560
question of where is the anatomy of this, the answer, the genome is not really the right answer.

28:48.560 --> 28:54.800
Yes, the genome encodes hardware that by default will say one head, but that hardware is reprogrammable

28:54.800 --> 29:00.640
and here you can have these nice, you can push it into this other state. And by the way, you could

29:00.640 --> 29:05.920
push it into a state belonging to other species. So this nice triangular headed planarian can make

29:05.920 --> 29:11.280
flat heads like a Pifolina, round heads like an S Mediterranean. This hardware, again, with no genetic

29:11.280 --> 29:16.640
change, this is just by altering the bioelectrical patterns that serve as the memory here. They

29:16.640 --> 29:21.440
will visit these other attractors in the anatomical state space where these other creatures normally

29:21.440 --> 29:29.040
live about 100 to 150 million years of evolutionary distance. But that's okay. This hardware can

29:29.120 --> 29:35.360
visit there if pushed. And of course, not just the shape of the head, but actually the shape of

29:35.360 --> 29:40.640
the brain, the distribution of stem cells are all the same like these other species. So what we're

29:40.640 --> 29:45.280
seeing here is the, first of all, the hardware, software distinction in biology, the reprogrammability

29:45.280 --> 29:52.720
of biology, the API, once you understand how the cognitive glue works that binds individual cells

29:52.720 --> 29:57.200
into a more global vision of what they should be doing, now you can start communicating with it,

29:57.280 --> 30:02.720
rewriting goals, and really collaborating with the material. This is, you know, I do a whole

30:02.720 --> 30:08.720
other talk on engineering with agential materials. This is not metal and Legos. This is an

30:08.720 --> 30:12.640
agential material. You're a collaborator with that material. You're not micromanaging it.

30:13.440 --> 30:19.360
So let's think about where these cells come from. So here's a blaster term. Let's say it's,

30:19.360 --> 30:24.480
you know, 10 or 50,000 cells in the beginning. We look at that and we say, oh, that's one embryo.

30:24.480 --> 30:28.080
What are we counting when we say that's one embryo? What is there really one of?

30:28.080 --> 30:33.600
But what we're really counting is stories. We're counting how many different stories there are

30:33.600 --> 30:38.400
in this tissue that the cells are committed to as far as where they're going to go in anatomical

30:38.400 --> 30:43.520
space. We're counting commitment and they're aligned. All of these, under normal circumstances,

30:43.520 --> 30:47.440
all of these cells are aligned there. They've bought into one single story and this is what

30:47.440 --> 30:52.480
they're going to build. That's what we mean when we say there's one embryo. You might ask a similar

30:52.480 --> 30:56.560
question in the brain. If I showed you a human brain and you didn't know what a human was, you

30:56.560 --> 31:03.200
could ask, so how many individual cells fit here? Like, what's the density of cells per, you know,

31:03.200 --> 31:08.480
per unit volume of this medium? And computers, we kind of have some idea of how much information

31:08.480 --> 31:14.480
fits into a certain number of transistors or whatnot. But here we actually don't know.

31:14.480 --> 31:21.440
And the amazing thing is that if you take this early embryonic blaster and use a needle to scratch,

31:21.920 --> 31:26.160
put some scratches into it, and I used to do this in duck embryos when I was a grad student,

31:27.040 --> 31:31.120
what happens is that each of these little islands doesn't feel the presence of the others

31:31.120 --> 31:37.280
for a while until it heals up. And so it goes and self-organizes an embryo. And then you get conjoined

31:37.280 --> 31:42.320
twins like this. You can get triplets. You can get all sorts of things. And so a couple of interesting

31:42.320 --> 31:47.520
things here. First of all, the number of individuals that come out of this excitable medium is not

31:47.520 --> 31:52.240
known in advance. It's certainly not determined by the genetics. It could be zero, one, probably up to

31:52.240 --> 31:57.360
half a dozen. So how many cells, how many individuals are really in there? Well, you don't know until

31:57.360 --> 32:02.560
they self-organize. And that process of self-organization is critical. One of the things they

32:02.560 --> 32:07.280
have to do is determine boundaries. Where do I end and the outside world begins? Or in this case,

32:07.280 --> 32:12.240
some other embryo begins. Actually, some of the cells at this intersection are a little confused.

32:12.240 --> 32:16.800
That's why in conjoined twins, one of the twins will often have a laterality defect.

32:16.800 --> 32:22.480
We actually figured out why in the 96 for the first time. Why conjoined twins tend to have a

32:22.480 --> 32:26.080
laterality of flipping in one of the twins? It's because these cells can't quite tell,

32:26.080 --> 32:30.000
am I the right side of this guy or am I the left side of this guy? But overall,

32:30.000 --> 32:35.920
they have to establish their boundaries. And the analogy to the brain is actually still apropos

32:35.920 --> 32:41.120
because we have lots of examples of split brain patients, dissociative identity disorders,

32:41.120 --> 32:45.920
all of these kinds of things where it's entirely not obvious that our brain is host to just one

32:46.800 --> 32:54.240
coherent self. And so one way that I've been working on to start thinking about how to

32:55.920 --> 33:02.960
understand beings, goal-directed beings in very different embodiments is to put aside the question

33:02.960 --> 33:08.240
of what you're made of or whether you were engineered or evolved and really just to ask

33:08.240 --> 33:14.800
about the size of your goals. What's the largest goal you're capable of pursuing? And so that gives

33:14.800 --> 33:18.480
rise to this idea of a cognitive light cone. It's kind of like a Minkowski cone except a little

33:18.480 --> 33:24.000
bit upside down. And so if you collapse a space onto this axis and time onto this axis, you can

33:24.000 --> 33:29.920
see that different kinds of creatures can have different scopes to the goals that they can

33:31.040 --> 33:35.600
conceive of. I mean, humans actually may be uniquely, their cognitive light cone is bigger

33:35.600 --> 33:40.560
than their own lifespan. And that may provide some for some interesting psychological pressures.

33:40.560 --> 33:44.400
If you're a goldfish, you may have some goals 20 minutes into the future,

33:44.400 --> 33:48.800
but those goals are probably pretty achievable. It's very likely that you will live for the

33:48.800 --> 33:53.600
next 20 minutes. So all your goals are achievable. For many humans, they know their goals are

33:53.600 --> 33:58.000
guaranteed not achievable because they can see and commit to goals that are bigger than their

33:58.000 --> 34:06.320
known lifespan. So for now anyway, this is something that makes humans kind of unique.

34:06.320 --> 34:12.160
And then of course, we are all compound bodies of lots of little subunits that have their own

34:12.160 --> 34:18.400
goals in various spaces that compete, cooperate, and interact with each other. Now, this kind of

34:18.400 --> 34:24.080
this crazy way of thinking about things as this cognitive light cone has clinical implications.

34:24.080 --> 34:30.000
And I like this not just because I want to make advances in biomedicine, but also because this

34:30.000 --> 34:36.240
is how we know that some of this philosophizing is actually on the right track. So this

34:36.560 --> 34:43.680
is the tiny cognitive light cone of a single cell. All it really cares about is the state's

34:43.680 --> 34:49.600
locally here. But what evolution did is scale it up via mechanisms that I haven't really had time

34:49.600 --> 34:53.920
to talk about, but bioelectricity is one of them. It's now the cognitive light cone is huge. It's

34:53.920 --> 34:58.480
the size of this whole limb. All of these cells, they're not pursuing their own local agendas,

34:58.480 --> 35:04.880
they're pursuing this triangle. But that has a failure mode. And that failure mode is cancer.

35:04.880 --> 35:10.160
So once individual cells disconnect from the network, they roll back to their unicellular

35:10.160 --> 35:16.640
cells. They can't conceive of these grandiose goals anymore. All they can remember is proliferate

35:16.640 --> 35:22.080
as much as you can and eat as much as you can and go wherever life is good. And this is a human

35:22.080 --> 35:29.520
glioblastoma. That's cancer. And so one of the things you might do then is on this weird way

35:29.520 --> 35:34.160
of looking at things is instead of targeting the genes or being worried about genetic

35:35.200 --> 35:38.560
defects or trying to kill these cells with toxic chemotherapy, you might say, well,

35:38.560 --> 35:44.080
what if we just forcibly reconnect them to the rest of the organism? So here's a tadpole injected

35:44.080 --> 35:48.960
with a human oncogene. And the bioelectric imaging already tells you, yeah, here's the first thing

35:48.960 --> 35:52.960
that happens when these cells transform is they disconnect electrically from the rest of the

35:52.960 --> 35:58.800
body. They acquire this aberrant voltage pattern. And if we co-inject an ion channel, it doesn't

35:58.800 --> 36:03.840
kill the cells. In fact, you can see here, the red is the oncoprotein. It's very strong. In fact,

36:03.840 --> 36:09.040
it's all over the place. This is the same animal. There's no tumor because even though the hardware

36:09.040 --> 36:15.520
of these guys is a little screwy because they've got this oncoprotein, they're being forced

36:15.520 --> 36:21.600
informationally to be part of this continuum. And that causes them to be part of a collective

36:21.600 --> 36:27.120
intelligence that just builds nice organs. Now, again, we're able to do all this, make eyes and

36:27.120 --> 36:32.160
normalize tumors and induce like regeneration in animals that don't regenerate and so on.

36:32.160 --> 36:36.800
Not because we're so smart or we're doing some kind of crazy synthetic biology. All we're doing

36:36.800 --> 36:42.640
is hacking the native competency of the tissue. And by the way, oh, and one other thing I wanted

36:42.640 --> 36:47.520
to say is that these cancer cells are not more selfish than normal cells. There's a lot of game

36:47.520 --> 36:51.040
theory that models cancer is being more selfish. I don't think they're more selfish. I think they

36:51.040 --> 36:57.440
have smaller selves. So you can be as selfish as you want as long as your cognitive light cone

36:57.440 --> 37:04.800
is large enough to encompass many possibly all beings and then it's fine.

37:05.520 --> 37:10.960
And so there's this issue and this is something that Bill and our other collaborators are actually

37:10.960 --> 37:17.680
working on this notion of increasing the cone of compassion outwards. So the interesting thing

37:17.680 --> 37:22.720
about us engineering all this is that we are not the only bioengineers. This is another,

37:22.720 --> 37:28.960
this is a non human bioengineer. And look, this is a this is an oak leaf. And you might think that

37:28.960 --> 37:33.920
well, acorns always make oak trees and these leaves, we know what the oak genome does, right?

37:33.920 --> 37:38.800
It makes these flat green things. But but here comes this bioengineer doesn't change the genome,

37:38.800 --> 37:44.400
the hardware is perfectly capable. You don't need to rewire it. I don't have to explain to this crowd

37:44.400 --> 37:48.480
why, you know, you don't use a soldering iron when you want to go from PowerPoint to Microsoft

37:48.480 --> 37:53.600
Word on your laptop. This this this this animal takes advantage of exactly that,

37:53.600 --> 37:58.480
which is that it lays down some signals that prompt the cells to build something completely

37:58.480 --> 38:03.760
different. This is made of the of the plant cells, not the not the not the animal. Would we have any

38:03.760 --> 38:07.920
idea that these cells are capable of building something like this or like this, right? If we

38:07.920 --> 38:13.440
hadn't done this, we would not. And so for that reason, in our lab, we make a number of synthetic

38:13.440 --> 38:20.480
creatures to really test the plasticity, the the the ability of these of the hardware to undergo

38:20.480 --> 38:28.080
novel novel scenarios. And this is we call these xenobots, because what what happens here is that

38:28.080 --> 38:33.600
some some skin cells are harvested from the top of a frog embryo. They self assemble into this

38:33.600 --> 38:37.840
little thing, which I think is a biorebotics platform. And we are interested in knowing where

38:37.840 --> 38:43.280
their goals come from. So here you can see they swim. They can go in circles, they can patrol back

38:43.280 --> 38:49.040
and forth, they have collective behaviors. Here's one going through through a maze. So it comes down

38:49.040 --> 38:53.280
this this arm of the maze over here, it's going to take a turn without bumping into the opposite

38:53.280 --> 38:59.040
wall. So it takes a turn. And at this point, due to some internal mech, who knows why it turns around

38:59.040 --> 39:04.240
and goes back where it came where it came from. Remember, this is just skin. Okay, there's no

39:04.240 --> 39:08.240
there's no nervous system. There's nothing in there. One amazing thing they do is kinematic

39:08.320 --> 39:14.720
replication. So if you provide them with loose skin cells, they will run around and combine them

39:14.720 --> 39:19.360
into these little these little piles and work them and polish them. And because they're working

39:19.360 --> 39:23.760
with an agential material, for the same reason we were able to do this, not because we know how to

39:24.320 --> 39:29.680
how to change the way these cells behave, but we liberated them into a new context. And these

39:29.680 --> 39:34.160
little piles mature into the next generation of xenobots. And guess what they do? They run around

39:34.160 --> 39:39.360
and they make the next generation and the next. This is basically von Neumann's dream of a robot

39:39.360 --> 39:44.320
that makes copies of itself from materials it finds in the environment. And so if you ask,

39:44.320 --> 39:49.920
what does a frog genome know? Well, it certainly knows how to do this how to make this developmental

39:49.920 --> 39:54.160
the hardware that goes through this developmental sequence, and, and then has these these kind

39:54.160 --> 39:59.120
of behaviors, there's some tadpoles. But apparently, it also can do this. And the amazing thing is that

39:59.120 --> 40:03.600
there's never been any xenobots, there's never been any evolutionary pressure to be a good xenobot,

40:03.600 --> 40:07.840
where did all this come from? Why is there this weird developmental stage of this xenobot? This is

40:07.840 --> 40:14.000
an 80 year old, 80 day old xenobot, it's changing into something, we have no idea what, they have

40:14.000 --> 40:17.920
their own behaviors, they do this kinematic replication that no one else, as far as we know,

40:17.920 --> 40:25.040
no other organism does. So, so this is really the thing when you make, or when you facilitate

40:25.040 --> 40:29.920
novel collective intelligences that have never been here before. And that includes financial

40:29.920 --> 40:34.560
structures, social structures, internet of things, who knows, we make these things all the time.

40:35.120 --> 40:39.600
We really don't know where, where their goals come from, what their goals are going to be,

40:39.600 --> 40:44.080
what their capacity for problem solving is going to be, we need to understand.

40:44.080 --> 40:48.640
And lest you think that this is some special, I mean, these these cells come from an amphibian,

40:48.640 --> 40:52.240
they come from an embryo, you might think amphibians are plastic, embryos are pretty

40:52.240 --> 40:58.480
plastic, this is probably some some crazy embryonic cell thing. Well, here is this little creature,

40:58.560 --> 41:02.480
if I asked you what you thought this was, you might think we got it off the bottom of a pond

41:02.480 --> 41:08.800
somewhere. If you were to sequence its genome, you would see 100% Homo sapiens. This is, these

41:08.800 --> 41:13.280
are human cells, they come from an adult human patient, no embryo stuff, adult human tracheal

41:13.280 --> 41:20.240
epithelial cells, they make something we call anthrobots. We, this is a type of agential intervention,

41:20.240 --> 41:28.240
because these anthrobots, remarkably, we found a novel capability. The capability is, and I'm

41:28.240 --> 41:31.280
sure there are many others, is just the first thing we found, is that if you played a bunch of

41:31.280 --> 41:36.960
human neurons and you scratch them, so you make a wound right here, these anthrobots will traverse

41:36.960 --> 41:42.560
down the wound. And when they settle down, what they'll do is they start knitting the two sides

41:42.560 --> 41:49.760
together, they heal this this this neural defect. And so who would have known that your tracheal

41:49.760 --> 41:55.200
cells, which sit there quietly in your airway for decades, if you take them out and you let them

41:55.200 --> 41:59.040
have a new life, reboot their multicellularity, have a new life in the new environment,

41:59.040 --> 42:04.000
they become this little motile creature that can run around, by the way, can be injected back into

42:04.000 --> 42:08.240
your body. There's no immune suppression needed because it's your own cells. It shares all the

42:08.240 --> 42:12.880
priors with your own tissues about what health and disease are, what cancer is, what inflammation is.

42:12.880 --> 42:17.360
And among other things, what they can do is they can actually repair neural defects.

42:17.360 --> 42:20.800
And so, so that's just kind of the biomedical side of things, but, but more fundamentally,

42:20.800 --> 42:23.440
and I'm just about done, I know I'm over time a couple minutes.

42:25.840 --> 42:30.640
Just fundamentally, what we see is that what I think these are, and this is not a,

42:30.640 --> 42:34.720
this is not the conventional, you know, view of my colleagues, I don't think, but, but what I think

42:34.720 --> 42:40.960
we're looking at in all of these examples is vehicles for exploring a platonic space or a

42:40.960 --> 42:46.160
latent space of possibilities. When we ask where do the shape and behavior of xenobots,

42:46.160 --> 42:50.640
of anthrobots, of other chimeras, and of the weird things that we make, where do they come from?

42:50.640 --> 42:56.000
Well, evolutionary selection is not where they come from. And I think that what normal embryos do

42:56.000 --> 43:01.920
is exploit a little pinprick, a one single point of interface between this platonic space and the

43:01.920 --> 43:08.240
physical world, and you get your standard reliable body. But, but what we can do is we can start to

43:08.240 --> 43:13.840
enlarge these little holes by making anthrobots and xenobots and other things. We can start making

43:13.840 --> 43:19.520
holes and, and looking around and starting to understand the structure of that space. What

43:19.520 --> 43:24.240
else is out there? I, I really think that what we're studying here is, is the structure of this,

43:24.240 --> 43:29.360
of this space that's around us and still very poorly understood. So just, just a couple things

43:29.360 --> 43:34.960
to, to finish up here. First of all, here's what I think the biology teaches us. Everything is going

43:34.960 --> 43:38.880
to change. Your body is going to change, your parts, the environment, everything is going to change.

43:38.880 --> 43:45.520
It's futile to try to hold on to specific details. And in particular, biology uses an extremely

43:45.520 --> 43:52.720
unreliable material. Everything is within, within a cell is going to go bad. There's, there's huge

43:52.720 --> 43:56.960
amounts of noise. It's, it's exactly the opposite of what we do in computers, where we make very

43:56.960 --> 44:01.840
reliable parts and we try to insulate each level from the level below. You don't, you know, you,

44:01.840 --> 44:05.360
you just sort of assume the level below is going to work. And then, and then that's how we program.

44:05.440 --> 44:09.600
That is the opposite of what biology does. Biology assumes the material is going to go

44:09.600 --> 44:15.120
wrong in a million ways. Whether you're a genome, whether you're, you're a genome that has to be

44:15.120 --> 44:19.440
reinterpreted by the species as it changes, you know, your parts are going to change. You're going

44:19.440 --> 44:23.840
to be mutated and your environment will change. You have to reinterpret it. Brains do the same

44:24.400 --> 44:29.440
as they change over time. They reinterpret their memories. Intelligence is everywhere.

44:29.440 --> 44:34.720
That's because the only way to do this kind of, this kind of thing, this committing to salience

44:34.720 --> 44:40.400
as opposed to accuracy means that intelligence has to be everywhere. Every part of the body has

44:40.400 --> 44:46.960
to be able to reinterpret, confabulate, tell stories, new stories about what it saw and,

44:46.960 --> 44:52.960
and what information it has to solve whatever the, the new problems are. This is polycomputing,

44:52.960 --> 45:01.520
which, which Josh Barnagar and I work out, work on the idea that biology has is, is just a

45:02.160 --> 45:06.880
huge collection of systems which interpret and reinterpret each other's computations in different

45:06.880 --> 45:12.320
ways. The exact same computation means different things to different observers. So it's an observer

45:13.040 --> 45:18.240
focused view. You can't say, what is it really computing? And from that perspective, each self

45:18.240 --> 45:23.920
is a, is a dynamic construction. It's an ongoing process of sense making of your own memories and

45:23.920 --> 45:29.920
the environment and it's self reinforcing. These are, these are, these are basically

45:30.080 --> 45:36.400
points of view. These are self reinforcing, continuously modifying points of view that seek

45:36.400 --> 45:40.880
to perpetuate themselves by making sense of whatever's going on now. And this is, this is a

45:40.880 --> 45:46.240
very deep idea from William James where he said, thoughts are the thinkers. If we sort of dissolve

45:46.240 --> 45:51.760
the idea of the distinction between data and machine, right? And we, and we think that the

45:51.760 --> 45:58.000
pattern itself is actually helping construct its niche. So it's constructing the cognitive system

45:58.000 --> 46:04.240
within which it will prosper. Then, then all of us are really very complex bundles of, of thoughts

46:04.240 --> 46:10.960
that have sort of closed the loop and learn to contribute to their own persistence within various

46:10.960 --> 46:17.360
physical cognitive systems. And because biology is so interoperable, because biology solves all

46:17.360 --> 46:22.880
of this on the fly, it doesn't, doesn't assume anything. Pretty much any combination of evolved

46:22.880 --> 46:29.120
material, designed or engineered material and software is some kind of viable agent. So we

46:29.120 --> 46:33.360
already have some cyborgs and we're going to have lots more in there, hybrids and chimeres and

46:33.360 --> 46:39.600
all kinds of just different bodies and minds where all of Darwin's endless forms, most beautiful

46:39.600 --> 46:46.320
on earth are a tiny little dot in this enormous option space of new bodies and new minds. So,

46:46.320 --> 46:53.120
so these, so the need now for a new ethical synthbiosis is clear. This, this old idea that we

46:53.120 --> 46:57.440
can decide how we're going to relate to something based on what does it look like and how did it

46:57.440 --> 47:02.400
get here? Did it come from a factory or was it naturally evolved by the random processes of

47:02.400 --> 47:07.120
evolution? Those two criteria are going to be out the window. We're going to have to deal with

47:07.120 --> 47:13.120
beings that are nowhere on the tree of life with us that don't offer us easy answers the way that

47:13.200 --> 47:17.440
for example, current AIs do when, you know, you can, you can kind of distinguish them

47:17.440 --> 47:22.560
strongly from, from biology, but, but boy, we're going to be surrounded by, by beings that are

47:22.560 --> 47:29.920
composites and none of those answers will be so, so trivial. And this is Jeremy Gay. He's an amazing

47:29.920 --> 47:34.640
graphic artist who drew this for me. This is kind of a new version of Adam and the, and the Garden

47:34.640 --> 47:38.880
of Eden because we've got our job cut out for us, but it's, it's going to be an amazing journey

47:38.880 --> 47:45.360
because we are finally going to, I hope, get better at detecting and, and relating to very

47:45.360 --> 47:49.920
diverse minds all around us. So I'm going to stop here. If you're interested in any of this stuff,

47:49.920 --> 47:57.120
it's discussed in various papers here. These are the people I want to thank, a number of postdocs

47:57.120 --> 48:03.680
and PhD students that did the work that I showed you today. Lots of our collaborators. These are

48:03.680 --> 48:07.760
the, the people who fund us on disclosures. So these are three spin-off companies for my group

48:07.760 --> 48:12.960
that have funded our work and most thanks of all to the actual animals that we deal with.
