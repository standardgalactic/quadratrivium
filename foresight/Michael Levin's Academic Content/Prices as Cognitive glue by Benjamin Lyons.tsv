0	4240	So this is going to be conceptually pretty similar to what we talked about last time,
4240	9840	but it's a little more condensed and focused onto just the core price economics are the absolute
9840	15360	basics of understanding the economics of collective intelligence. And so I'm just going
15360	19840	to basically go through it. It's fairly dry and abstract, but the idea is if you can understand
19840	25120	everything in this talk, then you've got the bare minimum. And anytime you want to jump in,
25120	29280	just feel free. And we'll just go through it. It's about 20 or so slides. It should take about
29280	34720	half an hour. And then we can discuss for the rest of the time. Great. Yeah, go for it. Fantastic.
34720	38720	Cool. So this is a talk of prices as cognitive glue and introduction to the economics of
38720	42880	collective intelligence. So here are our goals. Our primary goal is to learn the bare minimum
42880	47280	economics for understanding the general abstract principles of collective intelligence.
47280	51520	So there's a couple of things going on there. First, regarding bare minimum. So obviously,
51520	56000	I don't know a lot about biology, but I do know some absolute basics. I have a basic concept of
56720	61360	what a cell is, a basic concept of what DNA is. And this is helpful for understanding your work.
61360	64960	Similarly, what this presentation should do is give you the absolute bare minimum for understanding
64960	69360	the basic economics of collective intelligence. If you can basically grasp everything in this
69360	74640	presentation, then you should be good to go. And regarding the abstract side of things. So biology
74640	78960	is very useful for understanding collective intelligence because it lets you see concretely
78960	83200	that, you know, you start as a single cell, you're just physics and there's no magical transition
83200	87600	where you become like a real intelligence or something like that. Economics allows us to do
87600	91920	the complete opposite where it naturally gives us a bird's eye view and we can see the whole forest
91920	95760	without having to navigate through all the trees. And so that's going to bring in the other side of
95760	100800	this and having the concrete and the abstract is going to be very powerful. So specifically,
100800	105920	we're going to understand three ideas. The first is that economic production, even building something
105920	110560	as simple as a pencil, is actually incredibly complicated. You have to coordinate across millions
110560	115760	of people, dozens of countries and tens of years. You obviously need some way of managing that.
115760	120320	The way that gets managed is through the price system. The price system is the cognitive glue
120320	124720	that makes this possible by connecting people across space and time. And mostly what we're
124720	129920	going to be focused on is how the price system works within emphasis on the idea that prices
129920	134000	erase the distinction between other people, stresses and rewards and your own, turning one
134000	139760	person's problem into everyone's problem. And so the hypothesis backgrounding this talk, which I
139760	144080	cannot prove, but I think is quite plausible, is that all collective intelligences work according
144080	148560	to the same basic economic principles. So on the surface, they might seem very different, like a
149200	153520	cell versus a person versus an economy. But I think underneath the hood, it's all just the same
153520	158400	economics. So let's get into it. So let's talk about making a pencil. This is a very familiar
158400	163360	object, which we're hopefully all familiar with. This down here is a little diagram of what happens
163360	167600	once you've got a nice block of wood. And it seems very easy, you know, you cut down a tree,
167600	173360	you, you know, sort of divide up the wood into these slats, you slide some graphite in,
173360	177840	you glue the slats back together, then you, you know, dice it up, and you attach some brass and
177840	182720	rubber at the end, and you get some nice lettering for Dixon, Ticonderoga, who are not sponsoring
182720	187760	this, but just a little free advertising. So it seems very easy to do. But in reality, making a
187760	192240	pencil actually requires an immense degree of coordination. That seems virtually impossible
192240	196720	once you start breaking it down. So to chop down a tree, you need a saw. So to make a saw, you need
196720	200960	some ore, and these are going to be in different places. So maybe your trees in like Oregon,
200960	205680	but your ores in like West Virginia. So all of a sudden you're on like opposite sides of the country.
205680	210640	And so then you need refining processes to take that ore and make it into steel and manufacturing
210640	214800	processes to take that steel and turn it into saws and helmets and so forth. And just as you
214800	219120	keep iterating, it grows like this. All of these processes are very complex. They take a lot of
219120	223840	people, a lot of training, a lot of knowledge, and somehow all of it has to come together
224480	228960	in a very complicated way. And this isn't just true for chopping down trees, but it's true for
228960	233680	the graphite, the brass, et cetera. All of the elements of a pencil are very complicated to
233680	238160	actually acquire. And each and every one of them requires an immense degree of coordination. And
238160	243360	not only are they individually very complex, but they all have to come together at the same point
243360	248560	in space and time so that you can actually combine it into a pencil. So they all need to be coordinated
248560	253360	with each other. And in the modern age, these processes don't even exist in the same country.
253360	257840	So you might have manufacturing in China, wood from Brazil, your rubber from Mexico, et cetera.
257840	263040	These processes take years to complete and they're not on any kind of shared timetable. So managing
263040	268320	this process seems incredibly complex. And you have to manage it without a pencil because you
268320	272400	haven't built a pencil yet. So you can't even write things down. So the question is, how are you
272400	278720	able to do this? And what's most incredible about this process is that the degree of coordination
278800	284080	necessary is achieved with so much robustness and reliability. But I can take this incredible
284080	288560	pencil, which we now know takes millions of people and decades to produce. I can snap in a half and
288560	295440	nobody cares because these pencils are so widely available. The system works so well that its outputs
295440	300640	are entirely unremarkable. And you can easily predict that you're going to have access to them.
301520	305360	So there has to be some kind of system managing everything. We obviously can't leave this up
305360	311360	to random chance. And whatever that managing system is, it seems reasonable to call it intelligence
311360	315680	because it does what we expect intelligence to do, which is to navigate around obstacles to
315680	319760	reach a goal space. So like when COVID-19 broke out, you didn't rush to the store to buy a bunch of
319760	324640	pencils because you knew there would be pencils if you ever needed one. One hypothesis is that
324640	328880	there might just be a set of instructions in the economy somewhere telling everyone what to do.
328880	334320	But in economics, there is nothing analogous to DNA where we might think a set of instructions are
334320	339200	hiding. There are just R-no instructions full stop. So then we've got to really figure out
339200	343840	how is this possible? And the answer to that is the price system. So this is going to be our
343840	348320	primary focus for this talk is just the basics of how the price system works. So this is the
348320	352560	famous supply and demand graph. This is going to be the supply and demand for pencils. All the
352560	358240	numbers are made up just to illustrate. And so the basic way this graph works is on our y-axis,
358240	363120	we have the price of pencils. And on the x-axis, we have the quantity of pencils. And the graph
363120	368800	is done backwards for historical reasons. So the y-axis is going to be our independent variable.
368800	374080	The x-axis is our dependent variable. So quantity is a function of price. And we've got our two
374080	378720	curves here, our demand curve in red and our supply curve in green. And how each of these
378720	383360	curves work is, first of all, the demand curve is the sum of everyone's plans to buy pencils
383360	387760	at every price point. So how this curve is constructed, if you could just like peer inside
387760	391200	everyone's mind, what you would do is you would say, okay, at a price of five dollars,
391200	395520	how many pencils does everyone plan to buy? And the total amount of that is the market
395520	400160	demand for pencils at five dollars. Then you just iterate down. So the demand curve slopes down,
400160	405440	because as the price goes down, people, of course, want to buy more. So the price goes down and the
405440	411040	quantity goes up as we shift out to the right. And then the supply curve is the same in the
411040	416720	other direction. It is the sum of everyone's plans to sell pencils at every price. So you do
416800	421360	the same thing. You just take the total amount of pencils that everyone plans to sell at each price.
422000	427840	And the supply curve is going to slope up because as the price goes up, people naturally want to
427840	433040	sell more pencils and make more money. And there's one special point here, the equilibrium point for
433040	438240	supply and demand intersect. This is the point where everyone's plans match up. No one is trying
438240	442720	to sell a pencil that can't be sold or buy a pencil that can't be bought. So you can see
442720	447360	that the quantity of supply and the quantity of demand are the same at this equilibrium point.
447360	451280	And this right here, it's a very simple graph, but I think it actually does illustrate the basic
451280	455360	concept of how you could have a system that could build a pencil and how you could have a system
455360	460080	that's a collective intelligence, because if you can arrange a system so that everyone's plans are
460080	465440	mutually consistent, or even in the limit, if everyone has the same plan, that's the key to
465440	470640	large-scale coordination. Everyone is going to be naturally working together rather than conflicting
470640	475360	or at odds with each other. One final thing to notice is that the reasons behind the plans
475360	480160	don't matter, your goals stay private. So why you might want to buy a pencil or why you might want
480160	483920	to sell a pencil, none of that matters. So maybe you want to write something down, maybe you're
483920	488720	making pencil art, it doesn't matter. Like this system works for any kind of plans, any kind of
488720	493200	goals, it doesn't need that information. Given your plans, which only you need to know, it's
493200	498960	able to coordinate everyone regardless. So this is the basic concept of how prices enable this
498960	504640	sort of large-scale coordination. But the question is, why would an individual be interested in
504640	508400	participating in this system? It's good for the collective, is it good for the individual?
509440	514160	And the answer is yes, because prices help you plan. So to plan effectively, you need to know how
514160	518240	available one resource is relative to another. Like if you want to eat fruit and you're thinking
518240	523200	if I want an apple or an orange, you need to know how available are apples relative to oranges.
523200	527280	If they're very available, they're probably easier to get, and so you'll have to give up less time
527280	531200	and less energy to acquire one. Maybe you like the other one more, but you need to know how the
531200	537440	trade-off works. So what economists say is that when a resource is less available, it is more scarce,
537440	542320	and the scarcity of one resource relative to another is called relative scarcity. And the
542320	547280	brilliant thing about prices is that prices track relative scarcity. So when people plan to buy more
547280	551760	of something, which is demand, or plan to sell less of that, which is supply, the resource becomes
551760	556640	less available and therefore more scarce. And so by planning on price, you can plan based on
556640	561600	scarcity. So it would be hard for you as an individual to figure out how available are apples
561600	567280	relative to oranges, but it's very easy for you to figure out how costly, what's the price of
567280	571520	apples relative to oranges, because you can just go to the store and see that. And just to see that
571520	577040	in this graph here. So this is our original equilibrium point that we saw previously, where
577040	581600	they supply and demand curve intersects. So if demand goes up, it now intersects here. So the
581680	586480	price is higher, or if supply goes down, it intersects here. So again, the price is higher.
586480	591280	So when things become more scarce, because people are trying to use it more or make it less available,
591280	596000	the price goes up. And similarly, if the demand were to go down or supply would go up, that would
596000	600160	make it more available and therefore cheaper. So prices naturally track relative scarcity,
600160	606480	which is what you need to know. And the elegance of this system is that you can plan based on your
606480	610960	budget. So you have an amount of money, let's just say like $100 or something, you can naturally
610960	615520	combine that budget with the existing set of prices that you can easily observe at the store
615520	619600	to tell you every possible bundle of resources you can purchase, right? It's all just,
619600	623520	at that point, very elementary linear algebra. You can just see all the combinations you can buy.
623520	627600	So at that point, it's just up to you and your competencies to pick the best of all available
627600	632480	combinations of resources that you want to purchase, which is in fact, what intelligence is all about.
632480	636800	You have a lot of alternative ways of achieving a goal state, and you're trying to pick the best
636800	641200	one. And the price system makes that very easy. You just say, how much money do I have? How much
641200	646720	does everything cost? And that really simplifies the problem. And so if equilibrium prices actually
646720	651120	do reflect relative scarcities, then that allows you as an individual to confidently choose your
651120	656240	favorite available bundle of resources, secure in the knowledge that your plan will not conflict
656240	660560	with other people's plans, as long as the prices are in fact accurate. And we'll talk about what
660560	665760	happens when they're not. So what happens if plants are wrong? So we know that the price
665760	670160	should be at this equilibrium point where they intersect so that what everyone wants to do
670160	674240	is consistent with what everyone else wants to do. What happens if the price is too high?
674240	678800	Let's say it's at $4 here. What we can see by going over to the right here is that the demand
678800	684320	for pencils people want to buy or plan to buy, about 20 of them, and people plan to sell about
684320	689040	30 of them. So what this means is that sellers are going to have this issue where they're planning to
689040	693120	sell all these pencils and they're going to use that money to do other things, and no one's going
693200	697760	to buy these pencils because they're too expensive. So you're going to have an issue where people can't
697760	703680	accomplish their plans. And similarly, if the price is too low, it's a $2, sellers want to sell
703680	708320	maybe only 16 or so, but buyers want to buy about 35. So you're going to have an issue,
708320	712480	this creates what economists call a shortage. Everyone wants to buy a pencil and there just
712480	717200	literally aren't enough for everyone to accomplish their plan. So the systems and conflict people's
717200	721920	plans aren't consistent with each other. And that makes it difficult to achieve allostasis.
722480	727920	So there, this is really matters in real life. It's not just abstract graphs. So this is an image
727920	733760	of the famous 1970s gas lines. I don't know if this is something you necessarily, yeah, but so this
733760	738080	is hopefully a familiar image to some people. And you can see what this issue was in the 1970s.
738640	743120	The price of gasoline was kept too low. There were some price controls on it. And so people were
743120	748320	seeing low prices and planning to buy a lot of gas, but people weren't planning to sell a lot of gas.
749200	752640	And so you had these issues where people were waiting in line for hours to buy gas,
752640	757920	and then often they couldn't even buy gas because the place had run out. So when you get the price
757920	762720	wrong, you really do have this issue where people's plans are in conflict with each other. Not everyone
762720	767040	can accomplish their goals simultaneously. And the system really gets jammed up in a very physical
767040	770880	way because people are trying to do things that don't make sense based on what other people are
770880	777200	trying to do. So we know why it's useful for prices to reach equilibrium, but why would they reach
777200	783040	equilibrium? And the answer is simply because of people's self-interest. So if you're a seller
783040	787280	and you're trying to sell pencils, but the price is too high, you actually want to lower the price
787280	791200	so that you can make at least some money selling the pencils. You make zero money selling the pencils
791200	796480	for too high of a price. So sellers want to lower the price. And buyers, if the price is too low,
796480	799920	actually want to raise the price because if you're offering too low of a price,
799920	804000	the seller just won't sell to you. So you want to raise the price so you can get something. So
804000	808880	sellers are pushing the price down. Buyers are pushing the price up. And the only logical stopping
808880	813280	point is equilibrium. So just by people's natural self-interest, the price is going to be pushed
813280	818720	to the equilibrium point. And the basic idea here of what's going on is that your plans are
818720	823520	functions of other people's plans. And so to accomplish your plans, you need to make your plan
823520	828240	consistent with everyone else's plan, not because you care about them, but just because you're selfish.
828240	832640	And the price is the variable you can manipulate to make everyone's plans congruent with everyone
832640	836160	else's. So everyone's just naturally trying to bring things to equilibrium.
837520	841360	So what happens if there's a new stress? And this is really going to be kind of the key
841360	845680	section here. So let's say that you are writing something down and all of a sudden your pencil
845680	850480	breaks and you need to go buy a new one. If the system's in equilibrium, then as we saw,
850480	854720	every pencil plan to be sold is already planned to be bought. So there's not an easy way for you
854720	860080	to get a pencil based on existing prices. So what you need to do is bid up the price of pencils to
860080	865120	outcompete other buyers. You need to convince a seller to sell you a pencil by raising that price.
865120	870480	And so what we get is this diagram. So this was the old demand. And then because you want to buy
870480	876720	more pencils now, there's new demand based on your new plan. And there are two key facts about this.
876720	880880	One is you can see the intersection point, which is the equilibrium price has moved up.
881440	886960	And the quantity of pencils in the market has also gone up as well from about 25 to about 30 or so.
886960	890720	So price goes up and quantity goes up when you plan to buy more pencils.
891280	896080	And what this does is this is the stress sharing mechanic. So you bid up the price of pencils,
896080	900160	just because it helps you gives you better chances of acquiring a pencil. But because you're connected
900160	905440	to everyone else, the price system, this transmits your stress to them. So an increase in price
905440	909040	stresses out buyers, right? They see the higher price, they go, whoa, I was planning to buy a
909040	914000	bunch of pencils. Now that's harder to do. So I don't want to buy as many pencils, which is
914080	919040	exactly what you need. That leaves more pencils available for you. And similarly, an increase in
919040	922960	price excites sellers, they go, oh boy, I want to sell a bunch of pencils now and make money,
922960	927680	which again, makes more pencils available for you to buy. So just by bidding up the price of
927680	932720	pencils, you're communicating your stress to everybody without you necessarily even realizing
932720	937200	you're doing so it just happens anyway. And it looks like they're generously choosing to help
937200	941920	you out. But in reality, what's going on is they just can't tell is this stress mine or his. In fact,
941920	945200	they don't even know about you. So they're not even asking that question. They're just seeing
945200	950400	I'm stressed out. So I got to behave differently. And that takes care of you. And so this is the
950400	955520	diagram, right? So your stressed out price goes up, everyone stressed out. So if this diagram
955520	960080	makes intuitive sense at this point, then we basically accomplished the primary goal.
960960	965120	So what we can see is that prices achieve mind melding and the expansion of perceptual fields,
965120	968960	which is what we need for large scale collective intelligence. So as we've seen when you bid up
969600	974320	the price of a pencil, your stress becomes the buyer stress and the reward you would receive
974320	977840	from a pencil becomes the reward of sellers because they make more money. So we've got stress
977840	982720	sharing, we have reward sharing. And what this does is it causes perceptual fields to get bigger.
982720	986480	Everyone acts as if they know about your plans and they change their behavior to fit with what
986480	991280	you're doing just because the price went up. And this is basically what lets people make pencils.
991280	997040	The task of creating a pencil is too large for any one individual on their own to understand.
997040	1001360	But because of the way that perceptual fields get expanded, everyone's able to see
1002000	1007120	what they need to see to make the system work. And one important thing as well is that the system
1007760	1012640	depends on competition among the subunits to achieve this cooperative outcome. So suppose a
1012640	1017600	pencil seller tries to cheat the system and pretend that there's a new stress in the economy and
1017600	1022080	raise the price of pencils to make more money. What this would immediately do is incentivize
1022080	1026800	all of the other pencil sellers to undercut them and steal their customers. So lying and
1026800	1031040	trying to cheat the system in some way, immediately you get punished by your competition, we're going
1031040	1035920	to take advantage of your poor decision to make more money. And so my hypothesis is that all
1035920	1040640	collective intelligence has worked this way. We're all bound together by cognitive blues,
1040640	1044960	such as bioelectricity that are in some way mathematically analogous to the price system.
1044960	1049760	I think there's one way to do this. It's this basic abstract economic system. So
1050560	1056000	what justifies calling this I think a collective intelligence is a shared model perspective.
1056000	1060880	So prices are a set of publicly available electronically transmitted numbers that condense
1060880	1066000	a huge amount of decentralized information, which means they constitute a model of relative
1066000	1070800	scarcities. And it's a shared model because we all see the same set of prices. And so if we just
1070800	1074640	think about like an active inference internal model thing, it seems like you can associate a
1074640	1079840	self to an internal model. So if everyone has the same model, then everyone's part of the same
1079840	1085200	self. So it's a collective intelligence. And what this enables to happen because everyone's
1085200	1089840	sharing the same model is everyone perceives the predictions and an active inference sense of the
1089840	1094720	expected perceptions and planned behaviors of everyone else, which makes it very easy to figure
1094720	1099520	out how to achieve your goals while not interfering with and therefore being interfered with by
1099520	1105920	other people's goals. So to return to the original question of how we're able to build a pencil,
1105920	1110800	this is the basic picture of how that works. So all of the facts necessary to coordinate people
1110800	1115200	across space and time are things that some individual is aware of. Maybe it's someone,
1115200	1120960	a worker on the ground, or a CEO high up in the company, but everyone has some piece of the puzzle
1120960	1124960	and they incorporate that piece of the puzzle into their plans because they're just that's what
1124960	1129920	people do. They take their information and they plan on that basis. Then those plans, as we've
1129920	1134880	seen through supply and demand, are condensed into prices such that updates to relevant information
1134880	1140240	cause updates to plans, which cause updates to prices. So this is this diagram. So information
1140240	1146560	causes plans, causes prices, and then changes in information yield changes in plans, which make
1146560	1152800	changes in prices. And so then all people have to do rather than having to think, how do I make
1152800	1157040	my information congruent with Mike's or how to make my plan congruent with his? All I need to do
1157040	1161200	is make my plan congruent with prices, which is easy to do because I know what the prices are,
1161200	1166000	and I know how much money I have, which then unwittingly makes my behavior congruent with your
1166000	1171920	behavior as well. And so the simple signaling system allows everyone, you know, in the US,
1171920	1177040	Mexico, Brazil, China, et cetera, to coordinate with each other without realizing they're doing so.
1177040	1182640	And fascinatingly, this causes a massive scaling of plans and goals. So an ordinary human on their
1182640	1186960	own just plans to like acquire food and shelter so they don't get eaten. But when you combine people
1186960	1191200	into the system, all of a sudden people start planning to create millions of commercial grade
1191200	1196960	pencils every year. So this system really scales up people's goals by making it highly attainable
1196960	1201760	to achieve those goals. One interesting note about this is that if you can prove that this
1201760	1206480	is how organisms work, then you would prove that cells are agents, because one obvious way to think
1206480	1211360	about agents is that agents are entities that take information and turn those agents, turn that
1211360	1216400	information into plans. So if you can see that the biological system is doing this, then the only
1216400	1222400	way to make sense that would be that cells are agents. So just a fun little note there. So one
1222400	1227360	important point as well. So we can see how helpful prices are to us. Why are they so helpful to us?
1227360	1231280	And the answer, of course, is their own self-interest. They're just trying to help themselves.
1231280	1236560	So the price system has two goals. It's to be an accurate model, and it's to be a rational model
1236560	1240720	of the relative scarcities of all goods. And I suspect that's the goal of all models to be
1240720	1246880	rational and accurate. So just a reminder, scarcity is the availability of a good relative to people's
1246880	1252080	plans. The more people plan to use it, the less of the more scarcities. Relative scarcity is the
1252080	1256720	scarcity of one good compared to the scarcity of another good. So what accuracy means in this
1256720	1262720	context is that if apples are priced twice as high as oranges, so if apples cost $2 and oranges cost
1262720	1267920	$1, then accuracy means that apples are actually twice as scarce as oranges. The prices really
1267920	1272720	are attracting the relative scarcities. And rationality just means rationality in the Bayesian
1272720	1277280	sense, like prices should update as a random walk, not moving in a predictable direction.
1277280	1283760	And the way we know prices have these goals is because they pay people to improve its accuracy
1283760	1288320	and rationality. If you're a stock trader or a commodity trader or something, and you can make
1288320	1292960	the system more accurate or make the system more rational, you can become very wealthy. So the price
1292960	1298080	system effectively pays us to make it more accurate and rational, which is exactly what we need in
1298080	1304880	turn to enable a large-scale coordination. So this takes us to a primary conclusion, and then we'll
1304880	1310000	have a couple of miscellaneous slides after. So what I think is the basic things you need to have
1310000	1314240	collective intelligence, and I think this should be a universal principle. You need some kind of
1314240	1319600	system that collects all relevant information and condenses it into a single shared set of
1319600	1324800	mathematically useful objects, like prices, which are numbers. Numbers are very convenient.
1324800	1329200	You want these objects to be something that interacts with the subunits of the collective,
1329200	1333920	such as the humans or the cells, whatever, such that they persuade people to behave in the intended
1333920	1339840	way, which then allow you to manipulate these prices or whatever other objects to get the
1339840	1345040	system to do anything it can conceivably do, as we'll see on the next slide. You need the system
1345040	1350160	to incorporate new and updated information and have that transmit rapidly and accurately through
1350160	1355760	the system, which is what the stock market does. You also need a process for inducing honesty and
1355760	1361360	accuracy in communicating information, such as competition. And the result of all of this needs
1361360	1365680	to be a shared model that is an accurate and rational model of relative scarcities,
1365680	1370560	relative scarcities being what sums up the congruences and conflicts between everyone's plans.
1370560	1374080	So if everyone can see something that models the relative scarcities,
1374160	1378320	everyone's going to be able to act in ways that are consistent with how everyone else is acting.
1379040	1382800	So this right here, I think, is the basic details any collective intelligence needs to
1382800	1389200	have and is going to have. So a few couple miscellaneous points here. So I'm arguing prices
1389200	1393920	are analogous to bioelectricity, which means they should be the morphological code of the economy,
1393920	1399280	and indeed they are. So this is an example I got off Twitter. So taxes are like an artificial way
1399280	1403520	of manipulating the price system. You can raise the price above what it would otherwise be.
1403600	1408160	And as we can see, if you tax windows, you don't get many windows. If you tax roofs,
1408160	1412080	you don't get many roofs. If you tax frontage, you don't get a lot of frontage.
1412080	1415120	And if you tax finished buildings, you don't get a lot of finished buildings.
1415120	1419600	So economists believe that in principle, you can get the economy to do anything that could
1419600	1424720	conceivably do just by manipulating the prices up and down, which is very convenient if all you
1424720	1429280	have to do is manipulate prices, because that leaves the problem solving up to the subunits.
1429280	1435600	So a high price says supply more of this and buy less of this, but how to supply more of it and how
1435600	1440400	to live with less of it is left up to the subunits and their competencies. So just as an example,
1440400	1444560	if you want less carbon dioxide in the air, as we all should, then you can just raise,
1444560	1449360	put a tax on carbon dioxide. And then the challenge of how to adjust to that new price
1449360	1454160	is left up to people's and businesses. So managing the system in principle is very easy,
1454240	1459760	as long as you can move prices up and down. And then the final point here is what if there's
1459760	1463760	a flaw in the system? What if there's a missing link? So the system works very well as long as
1463760	1469200	everything relevant is being tracked, accounted for, and condensed into the price system. But what
1469200	1473440	if there's something that doesn't get into the price system for whatever reason? Whatever that is,
1473440	1478480	it's called an externality. So an example is just, you know, carbon dioxide like we just saw,
1478480	1483280	it's not priced properly. So the effects of it aren't included in the price. So people end up
1483280	1487920	doing stuff they shouldn't do, like over consuming, like buying SUVs and things like that.
1487920	1493360	I believe that externality is analogous to cancer. Cancer is an example of externality.
1493360	1498560	So a firm producing excess pollution is doing so because that activity isn't tied to the rest of
1498560	1503600	the economy via the price system. So it treats the rest of the economy like the external environment
1503600	1508960	as something to dump waste into rather than to take care of. So I believe basically externality
1508960	1514160	explains economic tumors and relatedly, externality causes developmental disorders.
1514160	1517840	So if there's something like weird going on in the firm, that doesn't make sense. Or if the
1517840	1522080	economy is creating goods and services that it shouldn't create, that's always going to be because
1522080	1526560	of an externality. And externality is kind of my thing. So if externality interests you, check
1526560	1531520	out my paper on my website, the problem of externality in 2024 for more information about
1531520	1535760	how that works. That takes me to the end of this. Thank you very much for sitting through this.
1535840	1539520	Here's my contact information. And if this sort of theme interests you,
1539520	1543760	I have an essay on my website, Prices as Memories, which goes into more detail about
1543760	1547440	some of what's going on here. So thanks very much for sitting through that. I hope that was
1547440	1551120	interesting and educational. And I'll just turn it over to you now. What do you want to discuss?
1552800	1562880	Thanks. Wow. Yeah, extremely interesting. A couple of things. First of all, in this system,
1562880	1569200	which we consistently with our multi-scale competency architectures, the individual subunits
1569200	1574560	that are acting on the price, buying and selling, they're rational agents. So they have a little
1574560	1580720	bit of intelligence themselves that allows them to execute these policies based on the price.
1580720	1587840	Can we talk a little bit about, or say what you think about, what's the minimal set of
1587840	1592480	things that they need to know and be able to do for this all to work? How smart do they actually
1592560	1600400	need to be? I believe it's extremely minimal. So the basic concept of rationality is a preference
1600400	1607200	order. Let me see if I can draw something for you. Maybe this is unnecessary, but let me
1608080	1613200	pull up, and I don't need to do it on a computer. Let me just show you. So the basic concept of
1613200	1618400	rationality is you have preferences as set, and then rationality is a complete and transitive
1618400	1624640	order. So I'm just drawing something here. If this is, I don't know if this is visible,
1624640	1628960	but if you can just see these three dots connected by these lines, this is a rational preference
1628960	1634240	order. This is an extremely simple structure that exists literally everywhere. If you have this,
1634240	1637520	you have rationality. This is the minimal competence necessary.
1637760	1649360	So yeah, part of why, this is something that I noticed very early in undergrad,
1649360	1652560	and part of why I'm attracted to your work. It's like, rationality should be everywhere.
1652560	1656880	It's in no way restricted to humans at its core. It's a very simple, very basic thing.
1657840	1663200	So yeah, so I can see, can you just connect the dots a little bit more? Definitely a
1663200	1669440	preference order is something that is common in biology. Why do you get from preference order to
1671040	1675840	draw the loop for me? So the price, you have a sensor that can sense the current price,
1675840	1680640	something like that. You have some kind of an other interstate that says, how much do I need,
1680640	1685920	whatever this is. Can we just sketch out what's the minimal agent here that you need to participate
1685920	1692240	in the system? Yes. So you would have preferences over, well, in principle, potentially every
1692240	1696400	possible state of the world, but at least when we're considering a standard shopping example,
1696400	1700560	preferences over different bundles of goods. You've got the amount of money you have,
1700560	1706480	and then let's say you've got $10 and like apples are $1 and oranges are $2. You could buy like 10
1706480	1711280	apples and zero oranges or like, you know, four apples and three oranges, et cetera. And so
1711920	1717440	the basics of economics is you arrange all of those possible bundles into an order based on
1717520	1722240	preference where you're most preferred at the top all the way down, then you just buy your most
1722240	1726960	preferred options. That's the basic competence. Can you take your options such as your shopping
1726960	1731840	bundles and arrange them in a list where you can then select your favorite one on that list?
1731840	1735840	And if you have any ability to do that in any sense, and actually working on a couple of papers
1735840	1742160	arguing that that power does exist to a much greater degree than people realize. So actually,
1742160	1747360	this is interesting. I'm working on some stuff about how human beings are diverse cognition
1747440	1751200	in human beings themselves. Cognition does not work the way people think it does.
1751200	1755600	And economics exists in human beings in places where people don't realize. So
1756560	1760800	you don't necessarily need to see people making like shopping lists, as long as there's some
1760800	1765760	ability to create an ordering over things that in some way map to options, you're good to go.
1766800	1770080	But presumably there's some, if you were trying to implement this,
1771520	1775760	somebody makes an offer, I want to sell you this for this price, and you can compare that with
1776640	1782640	what's the, what's the calculus that you then do to decide what are you actually willing to pay?
1785360	1789040	So there's two things there. So the basic calculus is you're really comparing it
1789040	1794080	to your opportunity cost. You're comparing it to your other best option and saying,
1794640	1799440	is this worth doing? If I do this, I don't do something else. Is that worth doing? So that's
1799440	1804480	what you're comparing is your two different plans, your two different predictions. The price itself
1804560	1808880	is all relative. So this is actually a key point. I'm glad you brought it up.
1808880	1813520	Prices just track relative scarcities. So the only thing that matters is the relative prices.
1813520	1819600	So if apples are $2 and oranges cost $1, or if apples are $4 and oranges cost $2,
1819600	1824160	it's the same situation. So the price is almost secondary in a way. The only thing that matters
1824160	1830000	is that it should be in some way a mirror of the relative scarcities as an ordering.
1830960	1837840	But in order to, that's very interesting, but in order to do what you just said to say this
1837840	1842400	over that, you have to have what? Counterfactuals. You have to have the ability to consider
1842400	1849440	counterfactuals or store memories of other options or like. Yes. So what I'm basically
1849440	1853360	working on in these papers, do you know, Paul, I think it's pronounced cheesek, Paul cheesek's
1853360	1859280	work at all? Sure. Yeah. So he's got this action selection hypothesis, I think is really congruent
1859280	1863920	with some, some recent findings in neuroscience. And basically what's happening in the human brain,
1863920	1868080	and I suspect similarly in other organisms, though I don't know, is you are, when you're
1868080	1872240	considering an option, you're actually constructing several options simultaneously. So like a motor
1872240	1877120	behavior, I'm constructing a bunch of different possible motor behaviors all at once in my brain
1877120	1883520	and anticipating how they're going to plan out. And basically very, very quickly, the brain compares
1883520	1887680	all of these different options by just, they, they, they compete with each other like literally
1887680	1892000	in your head and like kind of fight almost for dominance over the brain, whichever one wins
1892000	1896640	that competition is probably your best option. And then that gets implemented as a result of
1896640	1901680	winning that competition. So you do literally construct alternatives and have them compete.
1901680	1906000	And this is actually interesting because economists for a long time, you don't feel
1906000	1909600	yourself doing that. So economists thought, well, this is just like an as if you're not
1909600	1914080	really doing this, but it's just useful for modeling you. I think actually neuroscience
1914080	1918400	shows that this is literally happening. And so I'm actually, I have a paper title,
1919360	1923680	beyond as if kind of describing some of this stuff. So I do think this literally happens.
1923680	1928000	You do construct alternatives in your head. I suspect cells do the same thing, although I,
1928000	1933280	I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, it may, it may well be, I'm thinking now we should take a look at how to
1933280	1937680	cash out that kind of model in terms of, for example, transcriptional decisions, physiological
1937680	1942080	decisions. What does it look like to be teeing up a bunch of different transcripts like gene
1942080	1947680	expression, change responses in, in, in a following some sort of stimulus or a stressor
1947680	1951040	or something, and then having to choose one in this, in the idea that they can compete with
1951040	1954160	each other. It's, it's, it's interesting. Well, we'll have to, we'll have to see what that would
1954160	1961520	look like for, for cells. Okay, let's see what else. It's really interesting to me that
1963360	1968080	that the pricier plays a number of different roles, which is much like what we've been
1968080	1972800	thinking about for some of the things in, in, in the biology, the kind of morphogenesis field,
1972800	1977520	which is, so in a certain sense, it's this, it's, it's the middle node of some kind of bowtie,
1977520	1981840	right? Because it encompasses in a, in a very compressed representation, a huge amount of
1981840	1986880	other information, but also from that, it has all these fan out consequences that it sort of
1986880	1992560	encodes, encodes that. To what extent, so, okay, so, so, so there's that, then, then there's a
1992560	1996800	thing you pointed out about the shared model, right, that it, that it's also encode some kind of
1996800	2001760	shared, shared view of, of the world and it's binding, binding everybody together into the
2001760	2008000	same, same picture of the world. At the same time, it's a control knob, because by impacting,
2008000	2012160	I probably should get to have all sorts of interesting consequences more widely. And as
2012160	2017840	you point out at the end, it's, it also has a perspective and a degree of agency because the
2017840	2022560	price itself has, has certain interests in this, which I think is one of the most interesting
2022560	2029120	things that, that aspect, like watching how things can run that spectrum and can be simultaneously
2029120	2034080	though, all of the play, you know, play all of those roles, I think is, is, is very interesting.
2034080	2042080	And I wonder, you know, I wonder if we can say more, could we, could we say I'm in the system
2042080	2045280	you've described, there are a number of layers that you can try to imagine taking the perspective
2045280	2049280	of, right? So obviously, the easiest for us is the individual humans that are the individual pieces
2049280	2054640	that react to the, to the price. But could we say, for example, what does the world look like
2054640	2059920	from the perspective of the price itself? Right? What is its world? And I'm, I'm talking about
2059920	2066000	the kind of thing that, you know, when, when, when Randy Beier does this cognitive domain
2066000	2069920	of a glider, that kind of thing, when you, when you're looking at, at really unconventional
2069920	2073360	agents and minimal patterns and things like that and asking what does the world look like from
2073360	2080080	their perspective? Yeah. What, why don't we just start there? What do you think the world looks
2080080	2084960	like if you, if you're the price? Yes, I have given that some thought. I don't think I've come up
2084960	2090800	with anything terribly useful. But what does occur to me is that, you know, what the price
2090800	2095120	seems to naturally want to do is to preserve itself. It wants to preserve its relationship
2095120	2101120	with other prices. It doesn't want to change in any kind of predictable way, just like an organism.
2101680	2108400	And it naturally achieves that just by the equilibrium price just incentivizes people
2108400	2112960	not to mess with it, except as new information comes in, which then should update the equilibrium
2112960	2121920	price. So it does seem to me there is at least some kind of minimal model which you can think of
2121920	2137440	about prices, something like an organism that's trying to maintain allostasis and buyer. I have
2137440	2145120	no idea with that. Did I cut out? Yeah, there's something I can, but there's something going on
2145120	2154080	with your Wi-Fi, I think. Yeah, it might be a little unstable. It seems better now. I mean,
2158080	2161360	did I cut off there? Did you get all that? I think, I think I got it. Yeah.
2164640	2171120	Is there, is there any notion of, you know, like right now the price is a single scalar
2172000	2176960	and that's great for many things because it's an enormous compression into a simple thing.
2176960	2183920	Is there any idea about what would happen if it were richer, some kind of a higher dimensional
2183920	2190880	concept? Yeah, people have talked about that. I'm not too familiar with any specific models.
2190880	2195520	Right now, just getting everything incorporated into the scalars is hard enough. I do think that's
2195600	2202240	a rich area for potential exploration, but I don't have any specific ideas about it.
2202240	2209760	Okay. And similar to the question about the perspective of the price itself, what do you
2209760	2216640	think, you know, usually in biology what we have is we have the organism and then we sort of start
2216640	2220400	asking questions about the cognitive blue and how the pieces actually add up. So in this case,
2220400	2225040	we're kind of going backwards because everybody believes that the individuals are our agents,
2225040	2229680	but then, you know, there's this cognitive glue that you've identified that binds them together.
2229680	2232880	What do you think the collective is doing? In other words, again, looking at it from the
2232880	2238720	perspective of the collective, having been bound together by this, by this economic model,
2238720	2244560	what are the goals, the preferences, the competencies, what does it, you know, the economy,
2244560	2248480	I guess is what we're talking about. What do you think, what does the world look like from its
2248480	2255840	perspective? I think the answer to that is analogous to the answer for an individual,
2255840	2260800	which is less semantically clear than people believe. Like as an individual, when we talk
2260800	2265200	about our goals, it's easy to say, oh, my goal is to like do some economics thing.
2265200	2270560	But in reality, that's not really what's going on. My goal is to achieve allostasis by managing my
2270560	2275200	metabolism and like energy regulating the ins and outs of what's going on with my body. I think
2275280	2278880	that's also true of the price system. You could say, oh, like it's trying to make pencils or
2278880	2283840	trying to do this or that. Really, it's trying to achieve allostasis, which it does by coordinating
2283840	2288960	all of the subunits, getting everything to work together. That is in principle, its only goal,
2288960	2294720	I believe. Do you think that there's the active inference perspective, like something like
2294720	2301360	surprise minimization would be applicable to that agent? Absolutely. And I borrowed a lot from that
2301360	2305760	perspective. And it was moving away from economics to some neuroscience, like I keep bringing up
2305760	2309120	Lisa Feldman Barrett. I have a quote I have to mention my name once every time we talk.
2309120	2313760	Her work helped me make a lot of progress and then prepared me to understand your work as well.
2313760	2316480	So I think that's big and I wish more economists were aware of that.
2319280	2326800	Do you think that the system as a whole is trainable? In other words, is there a notion
2326880	2332480	of memory here that you could, you know, future behavior, some kind of hysteresis,
2332480	2336880	historicity, like future behavior would be different based on the history of prior stimuli?
2338240	2343920	Yes, it's a bit tricky to give a clear answer to this because I think it gets so mixed up with
2343920	2349440	the trainability of humans and firms. Like the economy is trainable, but that's not surprising
2349440	2354080	to economists because people are trainable. So there is a great deal of research about how firms
2354080	2357760	learn and like based on previous instances, they'll then change how they're going to behave
2357760	2365360	in the future. The trainability of just the price system itself, I suppose it's conceivable that
2365360	2372480	maybe certain, I don't know, like elasticities might be influenced by past behavior, but I don't
2372480	2376880	have any specific ideas. So right now I'd say it's a little tricky to disambiguate that
2377840	2382880	from just the trainability of people and people made organizations such as businesses.
2383600	2388400	I think we actually, so this might be an interesting thing for us to do some research on
2388400	2393040	because I think actually you can disambiguate it by analogy to what we did in gene regulatory
2393040	2397280	networks. So if you have a model of gene regulatory networks, which is just a set of
2397280	2401360	coupled differential equations that say how each gene turns the other genes on and off,
2402160	2406880	we showed six different kinds of learning, including pavlovian conditioning in that model,
2406880	2413520	but specifically the pieces A were completely dumb, so they did not learn. So unlike in what
2413520	2418880	you're talking about now, the nodes themselves have zero learning capacity, all they have is state,
2418880	2423440	so they just have whatever their current, they don't have any memory, they don't have any of that,
2423440	2429760	they just have whatever my current state is, that's all I know. So zero memory. And that's A
2429760	2434640	and B, what you're also not allowed to do in these models is change the topology of the network. In
2434640	2439200	other words, how strong are the connections? So the typical things you would do to train a network
2439200	2443920	like that, which is to adjust the synaptic weight, right? And the connections between the nodes,
2443920	2448400	you're not allowed to change that, the network is completely fixed. So no intelligence in the
2448400	2456640	nodes, no changes of the topology. And yet, just from the dynamical systems behavior of that,
2456640	2460800	of certain not all, it's not a universal thing, the way that you know, some of like, for example,
2460880	2466640	Stu Kaufman's origins of order in that network stuff is which is just like widely applicable
2466640	2470880	to random networks. This isn't like that random networks don't do this as well as biological
2470880	2476160	networks. So I think evolution actually has probably selected for ones that are good at this,
2476160	2481040	but nevertheless, there are plenty of networks that can learn without with the pieces being
2481040	2486480	being completely done. So, so I wonder, I wonder if we had an economic model where you clamp so
2486560	2492560	an in silico computational economic model, you clamp the behavior of the individual so they
2492560	2499520	cannot learn. Probably we can even we can even clamp the relationships between them. But we
2499520	2505280	examine the behavior of the system after stimuli that are patterned in the way that behavioral
2505280	2511040	scientists do it for, you know, for testing habituation sensitization, pathology and conditioning,
2511040	2517280	whatever. I wonder if we would if we would see learning there my conjecture is that that we would
2517280	2522480	I think this this my guess is that this is a very widespread capacity. And I think we could
2522480	2526720	potentially show that if you if you if you clamp, you know, if you clamp the behavior of the individuals.
2527920	2532000	I'd be inclined to agree because I do just think these systems should be analogous.
2532000	2537440	I'm wondering now so there's a Nobel Prize winner Vernon Smith who became sort of known for doing
2537440	2542880	economic experiments which we usually can't do very well. I wonder if there are some analogies
2542880	2546160	in his work. So maybe I'll try to read up a little bit on the gene regulatory stuff
2546960	2549920	and see if I can find any connections to anything Vernon Smith has done.
2550480	2555920	Maybe not, but it's exploring. Yeah, yeah, that's cool. You know, and I wonder as you look at the
2555920	2561200	GRN stuff, I wonder if we can define, for example, in these networks, what would be the equivalent
2561200	2570080	of the price? Right? Could we say that by watching their behavior? Actually, how about this? Do you
2570080	2578480	think that watching it's like a it's like a weird touring test. If if if I showed a bunch of economists
2579360	2585520	the behavior of some system, some distributed system, could they say that hey, this absolutely
2585520	2590640	looks like any like an economy or no, it does not. Is that something that or or can you make
2590640	2594400	anything look like an economy in which case we could actually do the mapping and figure out,
2594400	2598480	you know, what what does the price? What is the price in this in this GRN?
2599760	2604560	That's an interesting question. I never thought about that. I suspect that most economists would
2604560	2608640	just because you know, their academics just be cautious about drawing any conclusions that
2608640	2614640	haven't been like hard verified. But that's an interesting question. I'd be very interested
2614640	2618320	in seeing the results. Yeah, I don't know. That's very interesting. It's that's worth exploring for
2618320	2625280	sure. Yeah, I mean, one one one way to get started with that is if you identify for me,
2626080	2630560	what does it what does an economic data set look like? That is, what does an economist
2630560	2637120	fix? So if you were going to say to a colleague, okay, I'm going to show you the the parameters
2637120	2641200	of this economic system, what do they expect to see? You know, what what does the what does the
2641200	2646160	data look like? What what what are they looking for? Is it, you know, prices over time or distributed
2646240	2650880	buys and sells or what are they looking for? I bet if we understood the format of that,
2650880	2656320	I could give you a data set. I would, you know, we could do a blind thing where I wouldn't tell
2656320	2660560	you what it really was. You can show it to people and they say, oh, a classic case of,
2660560	2666240	you know, an economy of this type. And then we could find out that actually this is this is,
2666240	2670160	you know, a bunch of cells communicating during, I don't know, axial determination or something.
2670640	2676800	I think I think it would be interesting to to to to use that as a as a way of finding these
2676800	2682080	kinds of mappings, you know. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. I will look into that. That's a really
2682080	2688320	good idea. I think that'd be fun. All right. And I guess, okay, the last question that came to my
2688320	2695600	mind is this, does all of this does everything we've you've said today, assume a perfect efficiency,
2695600	2700080	like, like, like immediate, you know, instantaneous transfer of information, all that kind of stuff.
2701600	2710960	No, but of course, you won't, you won't achieve like perfect outcomes without it. But no, you
2710960	2714080	don't need that to have something that the perfection within a body, but I still feel like
2714080	2719200	myself. And I believe the same is true of the economy. And then as technology improves, we will,
2719200	2723840	of course, improve the efficiency of it. Right now, a tremendous amount of people are not terribly
2723840	2728720	bound into the economy. I mean, billions people are in poverty and so on. And so over time, that
2728720	2733520	will increase greatly. But yeah, in the first world, like, certainly the stock market or something
2733520	2737680	like that is bound together tightly enough. I think it's reasonable to think of it this way.
2739120	2743840	And I'll tell you why I asked, but I'm also thinking about, you know, kind of information
2743840	2748240	efficiencies, like, you're when you buy and again, I'm I know nothing about economics. So this
2748240	2752640	could be nonsense. But to me, it seems like when you're when you're when you're when you're
2753280	2757040	selling something, you want to get rid of it. And you think it's a good idea to get rid of it.
2757040	2760560	For that to work, somebody else needs to disagree with you and think that it's a good idea to buy
2760560	2765600	it. And so right, so there are going to be differences in how informed people are. And
2765600	2770000	somebody's going to make money because they're more informed than somebody else. And, and of course,
2770000	2774000	then people can make bets on what's going to happen with the economy and things like that.
2774000	2778720	Right. So, so the reason I bring this up is because if you think about, so let's think about
2778720	2783360	the biological case, you got a, you got a set of cells, and the cells are now coupled by gap
2783360	2789200	gap junctions, right? Now, so, so that's a kind of cognitive blue, because the biotech signals
2789200	2794640	are now spreading through the through the continued through the through the tissue. And
2794640	2799600	it's now harder for any one cell to be an ally or in terms of its memories, and it's a model of
2799600	2805200	the world because it's sharing physiological parameters exactly directly with its neighbors.
2805200	2810000	But in the real world, it takes time for information to propagate through that tissue.
2810000	2814480	And so much like, you know, the speed of light is a kind of like this limit in the in the in
2814480	2819120	physics that binds the ties together space and time, there's going to be a constant like that
2819120	2824480	in any tissue that basically tells you how fast can information propagate, right? And how fast it
2824480	2829760	can, it can can can can signals and information get across the thing. So you're going to have
2829760	2835680	scenarios where for some amount of time, there are going to be regions. So let's say so, so, so,
2835680	2840720	so here's your cellular network, your tissue, something happens over here to trigger it,
2840720	2844320	there's going to be some time where the ones over here know about it and the ones back here don't
2844320	2852720	yet. So I wonder to what extent, and you can also think about that delta, having something to do
2852800	2857200	with the thickness of the cognitive now moment, right, that that you're not instantaneous, there's
2857200	2863040	about a couple of hundred milliseconds in neuroscience, they tell you that that is when when
2863040	2867280	the things are propagated. And below that, you can't really answer questions. Did I see it? You
2867280	2872240	know, am I was I aware of it? You only you can only answer those questions from the definitively
2872240	2877600	from the perspective of the larger, larger cognitive agent from a certain, you know,
2877600	2881040	after the information has had a chance to propagate and all the subsystems have had their say,
2881040	2885360	and eventually you can say yes, you did, or you didn't. So there's a temporal resolution,
2885360	2889840	right, below which you can't really slice yourself that temporal thickness. So I wonder if
2889840	2895680	something like this is going on here, and I wonder if it's also helpful, if there's any kind of a
2895680	2899600	helpful mapping, if the things that economists, I assume economists know a lot about what happens
2899600	2906240	when there are discrepancies in information in the in the economy and ability to act and so on.
2906240	2910480	I wonder if some of those things could help us understand development or morphogenesis more
2910480	2916400	roughly. I suspect so. I mean, information asymmetry is a huge field of research where
2916400	2919600	like you're trading with someone who knows more than you about the good. So you have to ask like,
2919600	2923280	why are they selling this to me? And that can make it very challenging to create markets.
2923920	2929440	You also have things like no trade theorems, where like if we're all, you know, trading the
2929440	2933120	stock market, potentially the only reason you're selling to me is because you think it's going
2933120	2938400	down. It's like, why would I buy it? So there are instances where differences in information can
2938400	2942640	really make it very difficult to trade, even though at the same time, the whole point of
2942640	2947120	trading is to ultimately bring everyone's information into sync with each other. So yes,
2947120	2952240	there is a tremendous amount of research about that in both finance and information asymmetry,
2952240	2970480	economics. That's absolutely something that could be incorporated in some way.
2972400	2977120	Okay, yeah, the Wi-Fi is really good. Maybe I cut out again. Yeah, yeah, it's really
2977200	2983440	accurate. I guess the last thing I'll just suggest, and this is something we can do in later work,
2983440	2987760	is like I think you've painted an amazing picture of the parallels between the two systems.
2987760	2993360	And I think the other complementary thing we can do is look at the parallels of the disorders.
2993360	3004800	Yeah, so the various ways that economics goes bad and has various breakdowns of optimal functioning.
3004800	3011440	I wonder if we can map that onto specific disorders in other spaces in living systems.
3011440	3015680	I wonder if there's a version of, I don't know, developmental defects, cancer,
3016320	3022480	failure to repair, all those kinds of things. Yeah, I think cancer is an externality,
3022480	3027520	and externality is sort of the generalization of all of those issues. Currently, economists
3027520	3032560	have a very hard time talking about externality. It's actually hard to make it consistent with
3032640	3036960	economics. So I have a paper on my website talking about that issue, actually citing some of your
3036960	3041200	work as to how we could try to make progress on that. So I believe those parallels are definitely
3041200	3045920	there, and I have been thinking about it. And what we might actually need is biologists to
3045920	3050400	figure out cancer and then use that so we can solve externality. So the direction might flow that way.
3051120	3056320	Yeah, I think that's very interesting to think about which direction, probably both, but the
3056320	3061920	insights could flow. I mean, we've had some luck normalizing cancer, at least in the amphibian
3061920	3066400	models, we're moving on to mammals now, and to human cells now, but we've had some really good
3066400	3071920	luck in frog models. So we could think about what that might be. But I think in general, some
3073680	3078480	research that we could do together would be to get hold of a computational model. I assume
3078480	3086480	there are computer models of simple or maybe not simple economic systems that people can play with.
3087440	3092080	So actually, computational models have not been huge in economics because they haven't been able
3092080	3096400	to tell us anything that's surprising. And so actually, what I've been thinking about, because
3096400	3101040	you mentioned this before, is maybe they could make like a comeback, because it would be surprising
3101040	3107200	just to see economics in biology. And so I'm not familiar at all with computational economics,
3107200	3112960	but I do believe that is a very useful path. And relatedly, one thing I've been thinking about is
3113040	3117680	there's a field called economic geography, which explains like why does finance end up in New
3117680	3122000	York and like tech end up in San Francisco. I think that could be useful for explaining like
3122000	3126080	why does your heart end up here and like your kidney end up where it is. So I think computational
3126080	3130400	models could be interesting in that context, but I currently don't know anything about them. So I
3130400	3134000	definitely have to do some studying. Yeah, let me know what you what you turn up. I think it would
3134000	3138240	be cool. I mean, I remember, you know, from 100 years ago, like lemonade stand, right? Like you
3138560	3143440	could easily something as simple as that. And probably that one, I'm guessing is too simple,
3143440	3148400	but there must be things for students to play with. And that where if we, if we, you know, rip
3148400	3153680	the graphic interface off of it and use the underlying computations, we could test things like
3153680	3159760	can we can we induce and repair various disorders in the biology focus way? Can we try the learning
3159760	3165200	and the training? Can we use it to generate data sets to compare to other things and see if
3165440	3168320	economists can actually pick out which one's the economy and which one's the
3168880	3172320	morphogenetic signaling, all those things. I think we should we should look into it.
3173040	3175200	Absolutely. I think so too. Yeah, that'd be super cool.
