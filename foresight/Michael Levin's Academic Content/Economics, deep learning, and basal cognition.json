{"text": " I appreciate that. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to this. I think you guys both had some great ideas recently, and I'm looking forward to it. Can we just start and maybe, let's see, Ben can go first and then David, just say a couple of words about who you are and what your interests are. I'm a former stockbroker with the background in economics, and I'm currently studying the economics of collective intelligence, looking to put together an understanding of how people get along and accomplish things that no individual can. Cool. I am by training a stockbroker engineer, but I've been into AI ever since the high school reading age of intelligent machines, and then just kept dipping in and out of the AI field and kind of being like, it's not ready, it's not ready. After college, I co-founded one of the first AGI startups with like Shane Legg, one of my co-founders was our first employee. So like back in 2000s, and then went to work at Google and Facebook, and then Asanda, mostly either working on ML, but most of my time has been building like large-scale distributed systems. So really coming at this more from an engineering background, but also about three years ago, I left my job and dove back into AI and came across Carl Friston's work. And I think that's when it kind of all clicked for me. And I was like, wow, we have GPUs now, we have a theory of intelligence that I feel like basically covers. It's like, I don't think there's any more secret sauce. It's like, we kind of, the formulas from active inference look a lot like formulas from traditional reinforcement learning. We have the hardware now, so I just like got really excited about it and have been working on it. So that's like my software and engineering side. I also co-founded Plurality Institute with Glenn Wild, who's like an economist, and that's more on the human collective intelligence side. Essentially, we're trying to create a new field, academic field called Plurality Studies that focuses on human, scaling human cooperation and collaboration, essentially collective intelligence as an academic field. And we've been bringing together researchers from like political science, computer science, economics, peace building. I mean, it's such an interdisciplinary field of like, how do we help humans cooperate and using technology, and now especially AI to bridge people. So that's kind of my other project. But my main research focus is, and I can share a little bit of like the research that I'm working on. And I would love, you know, help and collaboration. And also would love to hear how you guys are thinking about this. And if I can help, because I think this is like the most exciting thing that's happening in the world right now. Cool. Yeah, please go for it. Yeah. Yes. So I will say yes. So Glenn Wild is an interesting name because I think he's got a very important idea, which is that we should be using markets to solve more problems because there's basically a perspective in economics that says, anytime you've got a problem, there's a market that can solve that problem. And people just haven't been creative enough historically about what kind of markets you can use. Like we're just very used to like trading like standard property rights and things. And there's a lot of other ways you could conceive of doing things. I like the fact that Glenn Wild is pushing that I'd be interested in. So I don't actually know what he's doing. So actually, I'm just curious about that. I don't actually know what he does with AI. So can you just tell me a little bit about what he does with the Plurality Institute? Yeah, well, the Plurality Institute is not is more of the academic like collective and human collective intelligence of which AI is like a tool. So for example, and I mean markets are one collective intelligence system. But then there are other ones like even like common sections on forums are collective intelligence mechanism where humans come together to synchronize on epistemology like on things that they know and believe and being able to use LLMs to say automatically deescalate flame wars in common sections and drag people to consensus is like an example. In terms of the more economics things, so using quadratic funding for like public goods funding is something he has been writing about creating identity like trust networks to create identity like social identity so that you can use that as infrastructure for all these other like market mechanisms is another one. There's someone that's working on vector prices. So rather than there being a single price signal, there's a whole basket collection of currencies that you hold and that people can specify their own values for different currencies. And then the way the trading works is basically when you're trading with people that are aligned with you on values, you automatically get discounts because they value your currencies more than they value some. So there's like a whole bunch of them. He just has a book out open source isn't like another like how large open source projects are incentivized and how collaborations occur without like a corporate structure. He has a book out now called plurality with Audrey Tong who is another inspiring person. So I would check that out and that's like is going to cover a lot of different aspects of collect like plurality and collective intelligence. Cool. Is a lot of that just on the plurality website? The plurality instant that instituted website, we like post events and talks and we have the link to the plurality book by the plurality book is like much more detailed. I will check that out. So maybe what I can do then is just kind of give a broad overview of what I think the basics of economics of collective intelligence are and we can see how that relates to our work. So the way I see it is that collective intelligence is all about getting people to communicate in honest ways in honest and relevant ways such that everybody forms a shared model and because everyone's behaving with that same shared model everyone ends up behaving as if they're all following the same you know sort of commands if you will like a dictator or a virtual governor and everyone ends up nicely coordinated to achieve that kind of signaling system. You need something that's analogous to a price system and what that allows you to do is it's principles very similar to what Mike has talked about in some of his work where you get a way of getting an entity to see questions about other people as questions about itself and so like information gets transmitted in such a way where like when someone else is in trouble you perceive that as stress to yourself when something benefits someone else you perceive that as benefit to yourself which we see very easily in the price system like if someone needs more food they'll you know have a demand for food that'll raise the price of food so that stress gets transmitted to everyone else which uses to buy less food or similarly if you help someone get food by supplying some food that they like their benefit becomes your benefit via the revenue you make some money so that very simple system ends up outlining really just the basic functionality of a collective intelligence I think that any collective intelligence probably follows basic price like principles where you need some system where people aren't incentivized to communicate honestly with each other and such that everyone's signals gets condensed into like your own personal situation so just by optimizing for yourself you end up inadvertently taking care of having one else so are things like that when you're looking at like AI and technology and stuff like I don't know what goes on inside a computer it's all magic to me is that is that what's going on with like the transistors do they all have their own like individual model and they end up like communicating to form a shared model you know I mean I guess it's not level everything is doing the longest right everything is like mutually reducing free energy and you can feed every part of the subsystem as an agent so in some in some level yes but I think what you probably mean is more directly in a computational way and like typically what we do now is we train neural networks which are a big pile of math but but essentially it's a thing that like learns function approximations and the way it learns function approximations internally and we're still studying you know what actually happens internally but probably yes things get partitioned into sub processes like sub functions with sparse or communication between them so kind of what you're described if you think like in your model an individual is this like very interconnected system and then it has these sparse connections to other deeply interconnected systems and this is like you know a cell is doing a lot of compute inside but then it's got just like a few membrane exchanges with outside or corporation there's a lot of stuff going on inside but it communicates with the rest of the economy the buying and selling products so in some sense anything that you partition into subsystems is essentially doing this it is using some form of information like sparse information propagation between units in terms of honesty I think that's a lot trickier because it's like the communication doesn't need to be honest it needs to be valuable to like I think there is like a theorem that like for communication to exist it has to benefit both parties and so there has to be some value to it and you can maybe say that that value is the truthiness and so you could like maybe decouple it into like signal and noise so there's like some truth value and then maybe there's like a bunch of a noise value if it's all noise that communication channel is just not going to persist and so in terms of I think when you're like hey there should be honest pricing mechanism I would instead say there should be the two agents or whatever the network of agents there needs to be ways for them to communicate usefully with each other which it may be is the same thing but they kind of co-discover what that is and that doesn't necessarily need to be imposed by a mechanism but if a market mechanism or some communication framework allows honest communication channels then you're making it much easier for them to discover how to use it. I don't know if that if any of that resonated. It does and maybe there's something interesting to work out here so economics has been talking about the importance of getting people to communicate honestly to achieve coordination for a long time and sort of the basic picture of that which is very silly and false in some ways but also maybe important for intuition is if you're trying to centrally plan an economy one conceivable way you do that is you know you have an allocation problem who should get what goods you can just send everyone like a giant questionnaire and say like do you need a new pair of shoes etc and the problem with that is that people could lie and they say yeah I totally need a new pair of shoes and so there's a lot about that picture that's very unrealistic but figuring out ways to get people to honestly is maybe a word that has some some bad connotations because we interpret in terms of like deliberate intention and like moral character it's really more just about like truthfully conveying your intentions so you so basically maybe this is a way of thinking about it you can sort of think of economics as a very complicated version of like a traffic you're just trying to get cars to not crash into each other and that means that each car needs to predict where each other car is going that means each car needs to be sending very clear signals I'm definitely going here and I'm not going to like turn suddenly or something like that so you're trying to get people to convey what their plans are so that everyone knows what everyone else is planning and so then they can pick a plan that's consistent with all those other plans and I guess this is valuable it's like much more of like I guess an information theory kind of take I think there's I think there's another thing that that is missing from that model which is that if you have like a really narrow freeway then some cars are going to get through and some cars are going to have to wait and there's not an easy way to resolve which ones so I think like and this is kind of back to the plurality way that I've been thinking about it is like these are all forms of alignment and I break alignment down into like aligning on action which is kind of what economics in some sense lets you do is like okay we all have common beliefs let's given our beliefs what should we do and how can we coordinate our action how can we all send our like our routes so that we don't like collide so that's kind of aligning on action there's aligning on epistemologies like how do we all come to believe the same world models and then there's aligning on value which is how do we actually like I want one thing you want a different thing they maybe maybe we want opposite things how do we align on that and all of these these three systems are all interdependent because if you actually want different things you're not going to necessarily even align on epistemology because the things you know only things that you care about enough to know and if you care about different things you're not even going to necessarily ask the same questions of the universe to get back the same knowledge and if you have different beliefs you're not going to align on action and they all have to be iterated so like if you can agree on the same epistemology then maybe you can shift both shift your values because what you value depends on what you know and so in some sense it's like you have to pull all of these three systems in and I think try and what that's another cool thing about economics is it also does help value alignment and knowledge alignment because prices are knowledge signals so they tell you know what goods are easier to get when and they're also value alignment mechanisms because they allow you to trade something that you value more for something that you value less so I think there are these pieces but they all have to kind of play together so I want to go in a couple of different directions with that and maybe the first thing I'll mention is actually pulling away from economics a bit and talk about some neuroscience so on a different comment I left on Mike's blog post I talk about the work of Lisa Feldman Barrett who's done super important stuff it's actually her work that really prepared me to understand what Mike's talking about because I don't know anything about biology and the active inference sort of predictive coding view of things that she's really advancing as a way of understanding what the brain does you know sort of we we do often naturally draw these divides between knowledge acting and valuing and the active inference way of viewing things very much pushes all of that together it's actually more like action that drives perception and really your goals are at the base of all of that but also your goals are determined by you know I think of goals as basically like beliefs or measurements that you have like your goals are in a sense your epistemology because your goals are your measurements about the world and your prior expectations it's a weird sounding view and maybe we can talk about that but um that's kind of how I think about that and so I would you know it's very useful sometimes to separate these things out because there's a reason we draw these categories we categorize because there are practical reasons to do so and so that can be useful but also it's I want a fully unified perspective where we're just treating all of that as kind of the same thing in some level and in economics at the end of the day when you're trading something you can disagree very strongly about you know like the trade ends up compressing all of that like if I'm buying shoes and the reasons I'm buying that would make no sense to the shoe seller as long as I like the price you know everything else is fine so yeah I'm not quite sure what the balance is there it's um because sometimes it feels like you do need to address things like that and sometimes it feels like it just takes care of itself when the system is set up right um if you guys are up for it I'd love I made a couple of slides and videos I'd love to share uh uh I don't know if that would be a fun uh is that okay yeah yeah go for it let's let's see cool um okay uh can you see can you see my uh slideshow here yeah we can yeah any chance okay full screen yeah is that better much better go for it cool um and this is uh two different uh ideas that kind of work together that I want to get uh both share and get you guys the feedback on I'll go really fast and then we can drill into something but essentially you know the thing I I'm really interested in is how do we make an AI agent um and uh like uh to define an agent is basically something that takes past uh like a sequence of past observations and then produces the next action so it's just I think of an agent uh I know Mike you think agency has goals uh but those are externally observable the knowledge about an agent uh so uh I think that's interesting to figure out so for this uh thing uh like I think of an agent it's just like some function that given a I think you're breaking up for me yeah me too me too and sorry David I don't know if you can hear me but I'm not getting any of this yeah me too I can't I can't hear what you're saying good technology's not a friend today I guess he'll try again yeah I've noticed that usually happens when something really interesting's about to come out it's because it knows what we're doing and it doesn't want us to make progress on these questions yeah there's a little bit of that is that background somewhere you've been uh yeah this is uh years ago this is Alaska oh nice okay I think I've been to Alaska but many years ago I don't remember much about it yeah yeah it was pretty it was pretty incredible this is my blank beige wall because I have that kind of apartment so yeah cool well yeah hopefully hopefully he'll come back um if not we'll just chat so actually I do have something I should address with you quickly so regarding the paper we've discussed I just want to briefly mention to you I don't know a lot about collaborating on papers and if there's something that you might expect a collaborator to be doing right now while you're working on other things that might not be obvious to me is there anything specific that I should be doing right now uh remind me remind me where it stands you have you you've sent me a draft sent you an outline uh yeah then then it's stuck in my court so I've just been in pain so I will I will get back to you with the next couple of days with it so yeah yeah and no rush I just literally wasn't sure if there was something it's not you it's me I've got a I've got a stack of drafts um on my just because I will get to it yeah okay let's see David is I'll be back can you hear me hi David hey hey sorry my computer decided not to run zoom anymore so I'm on my phone um okay let let me try to just do this without the slides but basically the idea is that like an agent is essentially some function that maps past observations to to the next action and general intelligence is essentially a set of behaviors of like I think in your paper might have this thing where it's like how do we navigate a space uh adaptive how do we adaptively and uh intelligently learn to navigate arbitrary spaces and I think of that as just like a collection of uh algorithms that let you balance exploration exploitation essentially it's active inference but active inference requires perfect Bayesian uh inference and really everything just implements a an approximation so uh the question is like how do you learn or build an approximation of active inference in various spaces and neural networks are function approximators that instead of building you can train given the right uh input output pairs so the idea is uh to basically train a uh a neural network that's a function approximator of uh intelligent space navigation and I think the way to do that is agents are basically duels of their environment so if you want to train uh an agent to do something you need to give it an environment where achieving fitness in that environment uh gives you the the behaviors that you want and so I think if you want an agent that's able to generalize learning you need an environment where there's always something new to learn uh and that the behavior space needs to be dense enough that the agent is able to always discover some new thing that it can learn uh that gives it adaptive fitness to the environment uh and therefore as it is learning how to uh adapt to that particular environment it is also generalizing learning it is meta learning learning so uh the idea is if you can give an agent uh always some new environment where there's something new to learn it's going to learn that and it's also in the process of doing that it's going to learn how to learn it's going to learn how do I balance exploration exploitation what algorithms what sampling algorithms can I apply to this new space how do I uh leave myself and grams uh uh like how do I store memory how do I structure memory how do I interpret memory uh in these various ways and so uh what you want is an environment that essentially gets harder or different as the agent gets smarter and I think the way to do that is make the environment and I think the way evolution did this is make the environment highly multi-agent so that uh what you're like there are there is complexity in the physics of the environment sure but really most of the complexity is in the minds of the other learners and this kind of goes back to economics and capitalism uh where uh you know markets are kind of anti legible as soon as you find out some trick that gives you an advantage in the market that advantage goes away because it gets arbitrage the way by everyone else that learns it and so I think you kind of had this with multi-agent setups you kind of can get into this infinite game where as the minds of agents get more complex you have to get more complex to be fit in that environment and this this is kind of just like creates this intelligent tread intelligence treadmill and I think this has been done in AI so this is how we get like go player or chess players it's like they do self-play against themselves and as they get better the game gets harder and but I think typically this is done in purely adversarial settings uh where and with an fully adversarial setting you basically cannot explore a lot of the behavior space because as soon as you deviate from some dominant strategy you get exploited by all the other players and so it's very easy to just get stuck at local minima because there's not a lot of ways to deviate from uh local maximum you basically have to really discover something new really quickly or you just get out competed by people that are doing the same old thing and I think the fix to that is basically blending this line of what an agent is in this collective intelligence sense I think one really strong technique for that is kinship so if you're in a world where other agents are say a lot of the agents around you are your brothers or your clones or your cousins essentially this whole spectrum of kinship then another way to think about agency is kind of you know if you have two agents that share the same goal you can think of them as one agent uh with just like really bad cognitive architecture where instead of just being it has to like learn how to pass messages to itself so one way to define agency is via uh essentially goals and kinship is this way of aligning agents on goals so if you have an agent that 100 shares the goal with another agent it's basically one agent if it's 70 sharing goals with that agent then you know it's kind of this blended super agent and so the idea is if you have an environment where all these agents are aligned with each other with various different kinship relationships you can create this really high dimensional behavior space where you're not always competing there's a million different ways to cooperate break form coalitions break coalitions established trust and so the idea is you know can we create a relatively simple fast to simulate in silico virtual world full of other agents the agents are aligned with each other in various kinship scenarios and then we scale off neural then we train larger and larger neural networks to drive those agents and get to LLM size you know billion parameter models that instead of predicting the next token are predicting the next action that an agent should take given all of the experience at scene and so the idea would be that if you give an environment like that you're essentially providing a gradient towards increased intelligence and then you're using standard machine learning techniques to train a function approximator for that to follow that gradient so that's kind of the idea behind the like overall environment but then the other thing I wanted to incorporate is this collective intelligence approach and I really wish I could present my slides I don't know what happened with my computer maybe I'll pause for a second let other people speak I don't know if anyone has feedback or thoughts or criticisms and then I'll try to see if I can get this other slide to work meanwhile yeah thank you for that I mean I have certainly heard a somewhat similar sounding theory that evolution evolved or intelligence evolved as some sort of you know social competition that you know primates competing with primates and birds competing with birds is where it comes from rather than trying to like you know build tools and so on um so uh yeah the idea about yeah you need a form of like some kind of protection some ability to innovate I mean there's a lot of aspects of economics where there's this challenging tension between wanting to optimize and wanting to create room for innovations like perfect competitions a classic example like you learned very early on perfect for competition you're going to maximize price maximize output your price is going to be as low as it should be but it's very hard to innovate in perfect competition because the way the model works is whatever new technology you introduce everyone copies that instantly you make no profit so but you're the one who made the investment so that just sucks so a little bit of monopoly can actually be helpful because that way you're making money and then there's even artificial things like you know like patents and stuff that give people monopolies to try to incentivize them to make those investments and innovate so that is a very important uh aspect of intention of any sort of collective intelligence system is trying to encourage parts of your system to improve and do better and trying to protect them from parts of the system might say oh we're going to copy that we're going to take that we're going to steal that um there's a part of this that maybe I know you're trying to get your slides up but um I saw in your talk you talk a little bit about like love and stuff at the end of that when you have you have a talk on YouTube and that's something that I had to bring up because I am working on a couple of papers about moral psychology and neuroscience including a paper on morality as a form of cognitive glue which it isn't really but it's a sort of an interesting counter example in some ways and um basically there's a model in which um kinship let me ask you this if um I suppose that you took all the families and you rearranged them like people didn't know that they were in the wrong families but you had families where no one's actually related to each other genetically uh would the system still work? Yep. Yeah so um I think of this as like I think of this as essentially reward sharing so on a genetic level uh the the genetic optimization process uh gives rise to organisms that care about their kin right so because a gene is present in the kin that it's going to make the organisms that come from it want to help other organisms that have that gene from the gene's perspective it doesn't matter whether you reproduce or your brother reproduces uh twice uh so uh and similar so essentially the the behavior that an organism exhibits that we call love is uh basically what it looks like when the underlying optimization process shares rewards or goal or like uh shares rewards between organisms but then the organism itself one of the things that it evolves or learns or whatever needs is the is some way to recognize who it should care about so we have all of these heuristics for knowing who our kin are um and uh once those things are in place uh it's the heuristics that matter not the underlying gene so uh I think if you train agents that see other agents and you give them a reliable signal that hey helping this agent is actually the same as helping you so every time this agent something good happens to this agent you get part of that reward and here is a marker that tells you who is kin and who is not the agent is going to learn behaviors that are conditioned on that marker and then once you stop training and you just let these agents go around behaving you can change that marker arbitrarily rewards are no longer even there right genetic evolution or whatever has stopped now you're no longer learning new policy now the learning is happening inside the mind of the organism not inside the the genes conditioned behavior on kinship markers does that did that make sense it does and there's a very important paper that anyone interested in this should read it's called the sense of should a biologically based framework for modeling social pressure and in some ways maybe the difference is subtle but I think there's a way of looking at these sorts of morally motivated cooperative behaviors um that does not in fact depend on any kind of evolved pressure to care for or intend to cooperate but instead it's just like something your brain just constructs as a living organism in its environment because it's trying to make it's in its social environment predictable and and so there is something of emerging perspective and my papers are somewhat drawing on this research that's basically saying let's not think about evolution let's not think about long-term cooperation let's just think about trying to make the social environment predictable and that's how we can actually get um these cooperative and moral behaviors and so that just might be something to look at because that's another paper released as a co-author and I just bring up Lisa's stuff as much as possible I mean this is also yeah I mean I go ahead Michael sorry I was just going to say that that also sounds like um uh the the uh imperial model of multicellularity that Chris feels and I published a bunch of years ago which is basically that you know if cells are trying to predict an uncertain environment the least uncertain the least surprising thing around is a copy of yourself and so this this is a this can be a driver for uh making cells stick around after you've divided to to form a you know a predictive of a highly predictive um um uh surrounding for yourself so that you live in this niche and then the frontline infantry is out there facing the uncertainties of the outside world but but you can predict them because they're you and so it's a lot easier that way right so so you can you can think about it that way as well have I talked to you about comparative advantage uh yeah no I don't think I want to go ahead David yeah sorry I had a question about that Michael uh so uh I don't uh so if you have a cell uh and the cell does uh you know given situation a it does random stuff then being surrounded by copies of those cells and you do random stuff and your clones do random stuff being surrounded by cells that in that situation do random stuff is not actually going to help you predict uh the environment so I think there's something more to that it's not that being surrounded by copies of yourself gives you the ability to predict your environment I think it's being surrounded by copies of cells that want to make your environment that want to help you make the environment more predictable that actually uh matters uh right unless you think that a cell by being able to introspect itself can predict the behavior of other copies of itself I mean I I don't think they're likely to be doing random stuff they're probably situations in which the responsiveness is kind of random but but I don't think that's the vast majority of what cells do and so I do think that if if if you're um it's it's easier to uh to anticipate cycles and responses I mean again I mean I think you're right if it's random it's not going to work but I actually don't think that cells are random in that in that way but let's um anyway let's let's let David do his thing oh okay yeah this is just uh so this is uh this this is actually mostly inspired by your work Michael and economics so I'd love to get thoughts on this but okay so this is the standard a reinforcement learning uh formulation right you have an environment you have an agent uh the agent takes an action in the environment it gets back some observation and a reward and then it learns to maximum to act in a way that maximizes reward and uh you can have a dual formulation this is which is the inference where the agent is trying to predict observations but essentially this is the the normal kind of loop and typically the way it's uh we can break this down into like an agent basically there's a bunch of observation states from the environment that go into the mind the mind is going to generate a bunch of actions over actuators uh there's some memory that maybe the mind has that it's reading and writing from uh and it's getting a reward signal so this is how we train agents in reinforcement learning or this could be trained or this could be evolved doesn't really matter and so the way we do this now in the field of RL is you have this giant neural net inside the mind and there's model 3 and model RL so they're like this is skipping over some detail but essentially you're training this big blob of math that you're jiggling using gradient descent to optimize your long-term expected reward and it is learning how to compress and basically how to compress the observations into latent states maybe store the parts of those latent states in its memory that then it can reinterpret and eventually to generate actions and so these networks can be giant in language models there are 100 billions of parameters in reinforcement learning they're much smaller because we just haven't figured out how to do it yet but this is kind of the standard setup and what I am proposing is a different architecture that is essentially instead of there being one mind there are many individual agents each agent is mapped onto some subset of the observation space and some subset of the memory space and some subset of the action space and you know they can be mapped to any or all of them but essentially rather than training one brain I want to train a neuron that in a collection when you put it together in a graph of other neurons knows how to co-organize collectively to solve the overall problem that the brain has so rather than training 100 million model network I want to train one million parameter network that when you copy and paste it and throw it into this soup of other neurons will self-organize into solving the problem and so the idea is rather than having to learn adaptive algorithms so in in this way you know you can imagine that there's an algorithm that you apply to many different parts of the sub problem but this network has to learn how to has to learn that algorithm in a bunch of different places because every sub function call might have the same kind of you know oh this is just like a regression problem but you have to learn how to solve regression in a bunch of different places whereas here this thing can just learn okay you know here is how I divide my problem into sub problems and send those messages out or here is how I you know pay attention to a pattern happening at this time scale and that's my job so the idea is to break down this one big blob of compute into something that can be done on this graph instead and I think and this is why I wanted to talk to you then because I think basically I started out thinking well this is an economy you know if these things were you know if the observations and memory were commodities and these things were like buying and selling those commodities or something like that that would give us so the question is you know the the inside of a neural cell is a neural network that we train but then the question is what is the cognitive glue between all of these neural cells essentially what is the protocol that they use such that when we train train the neural cell on the overall objective they'll learn something useful and the thing I came up with kind of influenced by active inference and collective intelligence is so now this is inside a single neural cell right now now this is an agent that just sees some set of inputs it has its own memory it's going to get some reward signal from the the cognitive glue and it's going to produce some outputs and I think the way to do that is that basically it it should be predicting its inputs active inference essentially learning a world model of its little world inside the brain and then voting on the outputs so that it can and in this case outputs can be inputs to another neural cell or just outputs to an actuator that moves the organism around so I think essentially I'm proposing some kind of a an agent who's that you know receives a set of inputs so this is some subset and it has some memory and then what it's going to do is it's going to predict the output at the next time step along with some bet so it has energy and it has finite energy it's going to bet on what the values of that inputs are going to be at the next time step it's going to vote on what it wants to set the outputs to also using this energy and then at the next time step it's going to see well what were the actual inputs and which bets did it win and then it gets energy in proportion to essentially gets energy back as a reward so the idea here is that these agents are incentivized to only predict the inputs that they have a comparative advantage on over other agents so the same input and output is mapped to multiple cells so as an agent you should learn to only to basically monitor your environment form models about it and then bet on the things where you have a comparative advantage to other cells and then as you get more and more capabilities to model your environment you get more and more energy that you can use to vote on steering around that environment this is all hand wavy and this is where I think I need help and help from economics because I started out with pricing then I had it actually be an auction or your or prediction market add an auction and then I try to simplify it just down to just like straight betting markets but that's basically the idea is can we come up with this like simple cognitive glue for a pool of these agents and then train those agents I'll stop now yeah no that's very interesting I think it's definitely an economy and you definitely should talk to economists I'm afraid I think a practical issue is I'm just not sure economists have actually done a lot to explore this space even in theory for the most part they've been content to just take the economy as it is and try to explain that and there's been I think just kind of a certain lack of creativity there in terms of envisioning other economic spaces and trying to think about building alternative economic systems like this one so I'm afraid I myself don't have a lot of practical things to say right now that might actually be of any specific use to you other than I think just affirmation that you're right that this is economics and that talking to economists is a good idea I think the mechanism design people are the place to start I mean I think that's where Glenn Wilde comes from but I gotta know if like Eric Maskin is reachable at all but like he won a Nobel Prize for that and I had a two-minute conversation with him many years ago it was very influential so you might just want to see if you could send him an email and see what he says yeah I think this is cool I'm afraid I don't think I can help you today with it but we should stay in touch and I'll let you know if if anything comes along because
