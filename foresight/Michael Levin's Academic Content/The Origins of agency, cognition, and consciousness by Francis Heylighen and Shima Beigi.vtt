00:00.000 --> 00:09.600
I already told Michael this is a little bit improvised. I was supposed to give this last

00:09.600 --> 00:16.400
week but then I was also I could be paid and in the meantime I have done a bit of hope but

00:16.400 --> 00:22.320
still not as much as I would have liked to do but I think it will be interesting.

00:22.320 --> 00:28.240
So what I'm trying to do here is for the first time to do a research but

00:28.240 --> 00:36.160
I've been busy with one on the origin of goldite, one on the origin of human consciousness.

00:40.160 --> 00:49.760
So what the two projects have in common is that they're both about agency which is a topic I think

00:49.760 --> 00:57.040
that in your lawyer you also have been thinking about. So agency first of all means it's gold

00:58.000 --> 01:06.800
that are moving to the goal in order that they need to be able to mess up the conditions in

01:06.800 --> 01:14.880
which they should be able to make the right actions. That is the main theme but then I want to go to

01:14.880 --> 01:22.240
a higher level of agency the human consciousness where you're not only acting reflexively but

01:22.240 --> 01:28.320
you are able to choose between different different causes of action and that will allow me to put a

01:28.320 --> 01:35.120
first attempt tackling the psychological heart problem of consciousness. So that's briefly what

01:35.120 --> 01:41.920
I want to go out on. So let's start the first part which is about a goal directedness or

01:41.920 --> 01:50.240
actually about a life. So all living systems are there because they have survived natural selection

01:50.240 --> 01:55.440
means they have been selected to be fit and to be fit that means that they should be able to

01:55.440 --> 02:03.520
survive and go. If they are not capable to achieve that goal of surviving and going well they simply

02:03.520 --> 02:11.040
simply are elated. So we can assume all living systems have this imbalal of survival and survival

02:12.000 --> 02:20.080
survival they can maintain their metabolism is of perturbed patients because the world is not

02:20.720 --> 02:29.760
always the same. So this I will summarize as agency living systems have the implicit role of

02:29.760 --> 02:36.560
wanting to survive and to maintain themselves in order to do that they need to that means they need

02:36.560 --> 02:43.600
to be able to support opportunities of surpassing perturbed patients and in order to act they need

02:43.600 --> 02:50.880
to have some kind of implicit cognition namely they need to know what action is appropriate for

02:50.880 --> 02:57.600
what perturbed patients. So that's the basic framework let's now go into more detail about

02:57.600 --> 03:07.920
how that could have evolved. So the best definition of living systems that I know is the

03:07.920 --> 03:17.120
famous one of Maturana eila autopoiesis. Autopoiesis means the existing is self-proloding it forms

03:17.760 --> 03:26.960
it's a network of processes that reconstitutes all and Maturana and Varela automatically

03:26.960 --> 03:33.680
connect this notion of cognition to their notion of autopoiesis because each system should be able

03:33.680 --> 03:40.640
to produce itself it should also be able to withstand any perturbations that may push it to

03:40.640 --> 03:47.520
want the self-maintenance so it needs to have this cognition. The theory of autopoiesis Maturana eila

03:48.000 --> 03:59.840
is I would say very difficult abstract sometimes confusing so I have tried to make a simpler

03:59.840 --> 04:12.000
version of it that is a version where that is based on a network of processes where processes

04:12.000 --> 04:22.480
then can be defined formally. Autopoietic system network of processes is something that some input

04:23.600 --> 04:32.480
transforms that input into some output so it produces new components it consumes other components

04:32.480 --> 04:38.720
or it transforms certain components into other components and then the definition of autopoiesis

04:39.040 --> 04:45.520
is that the components being produced by these processes are such that they never generate the

04:45.520 --> 04:53.440
same processes that started them so they very simply put the processes on the poetic system

04:53.440 --> 05:01.360
system produce components while the components produce the person the whole thing is self-generating

05:01.360 --> 05:12.800
self-producing. So to make that clear I start from what I call a process on poetry that means

05:12.800 --> 05:21.360
I do not at assume that universe is constituted of objects where objects are inert materials

05:22.400 --> 05:28.480
which ultimately people tend to tend to see as particles. I see the universe consisting out of

05:28.960 --> 05:37.280
process and a process is something that we can describe formally as action a reaction meaning

05:37.280 --> 05:45.040
you have some input things some they react with each other and you get an output and then a system

05:45.040 --> 05:51.920
such as an poetic system then becomes appellate network of processes so instead of start on

05:52.000 --> 06:00.240
stable elements of I assume it's stability is the result of process that somehow some are debiliters

06:07.920 --> 06:14.800
so what are reactions a reaction is kind of like the minimal element of my apology

06:15.760 --> 06:22.480
a reaction assumes that there are conditions which are distinguishable states of it's over there

06:22.480 --> 06:28.960
condition can be the presence of particular molecule of part of biological species but also

06:28.960 --> 06:36.720
be something much much more a social condition of worlds or over this anything that can be

06:36.720 --> 06:44.080
distinguished from its absence is a condition and then processes represented by arrows could be

06:44.080 --> 06:52.560
for example that a distinguishable condition appears a is formed and this variable condition

06:52.560 --> 06:59.360
disappears a condition is transformed into a different condition and some some combinations

06:59.360 --> 07:08.720
decisions react react to form a combination of conditions so this is very similar to the world

07:08.720 --> 07:15.040
to the one you think they are in element elementary partition but the ABCDs that are right here they

07:15.040 --> 07:23.600
can be any distinguishable conditions so it wasn't an elementary a poetic system it's a system that

07:23.600 --> 07:30.160
produce itself but of course it must be term thermodynamically open that means it must have

07:30.160 --> 07:36.800
input from outside and there will be some some dissipation with some waste so in this case I

07:36.800 --> 07:43.200
need to have need to have some in a of a some outlay of b and then a and a and being themselves

07:43.200 --> 07:50.480
now that's of course much too simple to have a living system so let's look at it and somewhat

07:50.480 --> 07:57.520
more complicated example complicated example in the sense that I have still an input I still have

07:57.520 --> 08:03.440
still still have an input in between I have a net of reaction that's that's much more complicated

08:03.440 --> 08:10.720
but that but that is such that every everything every every component we condition the the base

08:10.720 --> 08:19.120
the cities there is always always some produces it but in appears in disappears nothing nothing

08:19.120 --> 08:24.720
enough nothing everything is produced by some reaction and the whole reaction thing is keeping

08:24.720 --> 08:31.440
itself going so so uh for those who are interested describe a mathematical model

08:31.440 --> 08:36.640
all the chemical organization is something called chemical chemical organizing theory in which

08:36.640 --> 08:44.800
which you can at the conditions and a network of reactions becomes also auto poetic meaning

08:44.800 --> 08:51.360
meaning self meaning and closed closed that whatever is consumed is produced whatever is produced is

08:51.360 --> 09:01.200
consumed so now uh where does auto is come from that's kind of the assumption of my ontology

09:01.200 --> 09:07.840
that is that process self of organize into more more complicated organizations since

09:07.840 --> 09:14.720
so how I have that that in the simplest I start with a random reaction sections random content

09:14.720 --> 09:21.040
means any any a plus b c plus d's we have we have payments with that we have just generated

09:21.040 --> 09:26.480
random that random network sign then we have seen what's seen what happens is typically

09:26.480 --> 09:34.160
that itself organizes into the kind of auto poetic how does that happen to start with

09:34.880 --> 09:40.000
number of components that are available components of our conditions have the reactions

09:40.800 --> 09:46.560
the reactors form the components into components which come themselves out as something something

09:46.560 --> 09:53.200
the new components are on when you see you start with a number of components components you produce

09:53.920 --> 09:58.800
you add you add the new one up to the point that you point that you can alone do once because

09:58.800 --> 10:05.040
there is no material available to available to add anything there yet on the other hand some of

10:05.040 --> 10:10.400
the some of the kind of consumed but they are not produced or not produced enough to keep the whole

10:10.400 --> 10:17.360
thing going so you remove them in the end what are you left with with components that are being

10:17.360 --> 10:25.280
produced that are being consumed but such that that they are they are being consumed and consumed

10:25.280 --> 10:32.640
at the same time so this is a follow-up that I'm going to schedule quickly for this institute you

10:32.640 --> 10:39.360
can look at look at my papers the chemical organization the apoyosis is what is that a

10:39.360 --> 10:45.760
self-maintenance of reactors is an attractor of the dynamics that means that if you let the dynamics

10:45.760 --> 10:52.640
hold on its own eventually you will get something that resembles an autopoietic system or in most

10:52.640 --> 10:59.760
cases that the apopoietic system will trivial but in principle you can generate an apoyotic system

10:59.760 --> 11:08.960
like that to self-organization now what one thing to get to is that the apopoietic system should

11:08.960 --> 11:16.240
not maintain itself in real circumstances that mean ideal circumstances where all the input

11:17.280 --> 11:26.000
components are not there but in the presence of an environment where things are not always

11:26.000 --> 11:32.480
available sometimes there are conditions that are interfering with your reactions sometimes the

11:32.480 --> 11:41.840
conditions you need for your reactions are not there so I've said that the apoyotic regime is

11:41.840 --> 11:47.200
an attractor but there will be the patients that will be pushing the system out of its

11:47.200 --> 11:54.000
attractor so if we think about the apopoietic system as a kind of a very primitive organism that

11:54.000 --> 12:01.040
organ lacks food so even at the moment there's not enough impotence it will die on the other

12:01.040 --> 12:09.280
hands it it may die because of toxin that means components that interfere with the reactions

12:09.280 --> 12:20.560
that are necessary to the whole thing align so first stage is the system of organisms into

12:20.560 --> 12:26.480
something self-maintaining second age that self-maintaining system being thrown around by

12:26.480 --> 12:35.200
perturbants most most of them are killed by perturbations but eventually we may assume

12:35.200 --> 12:43.120
evolution will lead to another system that's resilient resilient that means that it is able

12:43.120 --> 12:49.360
to bounce back from these perturbations that there are all kinds of changes happening in the

12:49.360 --> 12:55.520
environment it can somehow compensate for these perturbations that means for example

12:56.560 --> 13:03.360
some some components of you that's previously worked as toxins that means they are perturbing

13:03.360 --> 13:11.280
the metabolism your version apopoietic system the more resilient and will have some way to

13:11.280 --> 13:19.440
neutralize these toxins since if for example the food is not available maybe it will have developed

13:19.440 --> 13:27.920
some internal reactions to digest a different type of food so i'm assuming that if the process of

13:27.920 --> 13:33.360
evolution goes on long enough the system will become more and more and more resilient we have

13:33.360 --> 13:39.600
done a number of simulations with these networks and indeed you see that if you give it enough time

13:39.600 --> 13:44.480
the time it tends to become more resilient so so what does it mean resilient in terms of

13:44.480 --> 13:53.600
dynamic systems it means that the auto system is an attracter it's basic basic of attack means

13:53.600 --> 14:01.920
all all the options that lead to the attracter become exciting will become wider it will have

14:01.920 --> 14:11.200
a wider range of viability so let's imagine this the dark green that you see is the attracter that

14:11.200 --> 14:19.440
means that is the autopoietic regime which the system tries to turn the light is the base that

14:19.440 --> 14:26.720
means all of the different regulations from which the autopoietic system can back to its

14:26.720 --> 14:36.080
its regime of sitenance a partition then means means any unregulated change that makes the system

14:36.080 --> 14:43.360
move from one position to another as long as the perturbations remain inside the basin they

14:43.360 --> 14:49.760
will automatically be compensated because as long as the system is in the basin it will on its own

14:49.760 --> 14:56.880
go to the reactor if on the other hand perturbation can push the system outside of the basin then it

14:56.880 --> 15:02.640
will no longer go with the attracter which means that basically the autopoietic system

15:02.640 --> 15:08.800
longer autopoietic that cannot maintain itself what could potentially potentially happen is

15:08.800 --> 15:14.960
also a different attracter attracter potentially could be could be even better let's not discuss that here

15:19.040 --> 15:27.200
so that allows me now to define directness as resilient autopoiesis

15:28.160 --> 15:35.120
autopoiesis is the attracter as autopoiesis this means if you perturb it from the attracter if

15:35.120 --> 15:44.160
you put it out of the attracter it will come back it has a one basin and basin is is a growing

15:44.160 --> 15:53.760
process of self-made so it's not an equilibrium like a thermo system versus thermo thermodynamic

15:53.840 --> 16:00.080
equilibrium that is not a living system a living system is a process that is actively

16:00.080 --> 16:08.240
self-maintaining that is consuming and producing so operation what does that mean a goal-directed

16:08.240 --> 16:14.720
system if it's not in goal it will move towards the goal if it's in the goal it will stay in goal

16:16.080 --> 16:20.880
if it perturbed it means if it's pushed off its goal it will it will perform

16:20.880 --> 16:28.000
action that requires energy so as so as to return to that so that we might kind of a

16:28.000 --> 16:34.960
minimal thing of goldness in living living systems a basic basic form of aid

16:36.320 --> 16:44.720
now we come to the issue of cognition so goal-directed activity we can say requires

16:44.720 --> 16:51.600
a minimal form of cognition because it needs to be able to compensate the deviations from the rule

16:52.640 --> 17:01.520
so if we look from the inside autopoietic system it undergoes a deviation it should it should somehow

17:01.520 --> 17:06.480
do something that there is that there is a deviation that that means it needs some ability

17:06.480 --> 17:12.320
ability of person of something thing and it should also have an ability to perform an action that

17:12.320 --> 17:20.480
means one of its repertoire of reactions should switch on so as to neutralize the deviation

17:21.600 --> 17:29.760
and implicit in this whole dynamic is the notion of knowledge namely action that still gets

17:29.760 --> 17:34.640
by the sun's condition should be appropriate for that to that condition so the sun should

17:34.640 --> 17:42.960
somehow know which action to perform for which condition and that now model model with additional

17:44.160 --> 17:54.640
format is used in AI action rules so function rules you have an agent the agent has a number of

17:54.640 --> 17:59.680
condition action rules that means it recognizes a certain condition for example it

18:00.640 --> 18:09.200
senses that is condition X and it knows if I'm in condition X then I should perform action Y

18:10.160 --> 18:17.920
and we can help with that simply as a process X to Y that process in one of the processes inside

18:17.920 --> 18:22.800
this complex network processes that in a poetic system system

18:22.960 --> 18:30.640
now cognition are lots of definitions of cognition and we need to be

18:30.640 --> 18:37.280
to be careful about what we mean by cognition so one of the more interesting results from

18:37.280 --> 18:46.000
cyber ethics is so-called the law of regulatory models proposed by Conant and Ashby and it says

18:46.800 --> 18:52.720
if you want to have a directed system standard girl direct system must include some mapping

18:52.720 --> 18:59.680
which they call a model namely it should map all the potential deviation perturbations

19:00.240 --> 19:08.000
the right action that means for deviation there should one specific action that mapping exists

19:08.000 --> 19:18.000
then the system is able to control to reach girl and that's model we might say implement the

19:18.000 --> 19:24.800
systems like now model is a common term when thinking about evolution the system has a model

19:24.800 --> 19:30.880
of its environment but that is not the way the way that Maturana Varela interpreted

19:30.880 --> 19:39.600
Ryan and Varela and size it what Conant and Ashby call it is not a representation of the

19:39.600 --> 19:46.880
environment what they say is the is the audit system is autonomous it functions functions

19:47.440 --> 19:55.120
it does not know what is going on in the external world the only thing that we can know is

19:56.720 --> 20:04.640
the deviations its senses it has a metabolism it has a network processes when one of its processes

20:05.440 --> 20:12.720
is functioning the way it should be the whole whole poetic system is perturbances that

20:12.960 --> 20:20.640
there is something wrong but it does not know what lost the deviation so Maturana Varela

20:20.640 --> 20:29.520
emphasized that this kind of knowledge is subjective the auto poetic system knows only

20:29.520 --> 20:37.360
the things that affect its own auto poetic auto poetic it does not represent the environment

20:37.360 --> 20:46.400
in some objective way so now we become to the further evolution so we only have a system that

20:46.400 --> 20:55.920
is almost that is girl like that has some level of cognitive but but he can think this cognition

20:55.920 --> 21:03.600
mission should accept the system be able to adapt adapt these conditions and and lots of

21:04.560 --> 21:11.040
if there is a lot of variation in the environment the conditions will change so that means the

21:11.040 --> 21:17.520
system should be able to sense emotions should be able to interpret the conditions it should be

21:17.520 --> 21:24.080
able to make sense of the conditions that its senses so it requires that it has some elementary

21:24.160 --> 21:30.160
awareness not not really of what objectively going on in the environment but

21:32.320 --> 21:39.840
in what in what way are changing in the environment so that it affects itself so

21:39.840 --> 21:50.000
so we let let evolution its role the system will need to become more aware more and more and more

21:50.080 --> 21:58.160
in so that it can recognize a wider range of of conditions and can interpret them and perform

21:58.160 --> 22:07.360
the right types of actions so so now this is a scheme that you probably seen which I borrow from

22:07.760 --> 22:21.600
Michael he called the cognitive viability I have only the cone of OS so if an agent that is

22:21.600 --> 22:29.840
situated somewhere in the middle of that of that cone agent will to some extent be aware of

22:30.720 --> 22:37.840
what is going on in its environment from this purely specific point of view but still it will

22:37.840 --> 22:48.160
to some degree be aware of conditions in the past in the future in the neighborhood so the cone

22:48.160 --> 22:55.280
kind of kind of represents the range of awareness the kind of kind of range of the system the

22:55.280 --> 23:04.640
potential makes sense the more advanced the system the wider the cone so here is another picture

23:04.640 --> 23:12.640
that I took from Michael here are some examples of cones a very small creature like a pig will have

23:12.640 --> 23:20.320
a very small cone a human can have a very big cone and a dog can have something in between

23:20.320 --> 23:29.200
but now I come I make a very very big jump I started by it by explaining how the boy has

23:29.200 --> 23:38.480
this this which is the organization of a single like a big theorem and now I'm making a jump

23:38.480 --> 23:50.320
in human consciousness so let's forget about all the stages model the cellularity animals

23:50.880 --> 23:56.880
nervous systems etc but what is the essence of the different between the cognition of a

23:56.880 --> 24:05.360
vacuum and the cognition of human or in bacteria the way I use the con the the cognition is

24:05.360 --> 24:11.280
deterministic the the being sense is a part is a particular con performs a part of a particular

24:12.480 --> 24:19.360
always the same condition leads to same action now we're speaking about higher organisms organisms

24:19.360 --> 24:26.640
and we humans are there but probably others probably apes talking sense other mammals and

24:26.640 --> 24:34.880
maybe both are also there but there is an intermediate decision making stage that means

24:34.880 --> 24:42.400
there is a condition that the organism senses and then there is a state here I have called reflection

24:43.040 --> 24:52.800
of considering different of all ways of reacting to that condition condition means that the action

24:52.880 --> 25:01.280
follows so a part of reflection action and actually there is no action I I make some of

25:01.280 --> 25:07.760
the conditionation in women I can decide I need to act in this way or I can decide there is no

25:07.760 --> 25:17.360
action words taking so this is what's called free will we humans have the ability to consider

25:17.360 --> 25:24.320
many different forces and to choose one of them and that is typically what we will

25:24.320 --> 25:29.840
will call conscious ability of considering different possibilities

25:31.680 --> 25:40.880
now define it's easiest to distinguish conscious or subconsciousness so we humans

25:40.880 --> 25:49.680
still have the same level of subconscious reactions like bacteria and like simple organism we have

25:49.680 --> 25:58.480
this kind of automatic involuntary reflex for example if I put my hand on a hot so I will

25:58.480 --> 26:07.520
pull it away immediately I don't need to think about what this is hot if my hand on it on it

26:07.520 --> 26:12.800
then it will burn therefore I should pull it pull away my I will just pull away my way my

26:12.800 --> 26:21.440
and I may not feel the heat of the of the stuff so that process implemented in the brain it's

26:22.880 --> 26:28.960
modeled as what is not a speed forward process it's a process that goes straight from

26:29.680 --> 26:37.840
sense condition to action they stay immediate way there are no details now what's the difference

26:37.840 --> 26:45.200
with with the conscious process a conscious process is a process that we can monitor we can in

26:45.200 --> 26:53.040
our mind minds we know what we are thinking we can I mean our thoughts also redirect our

26:53.360 --> 27:01.040
for example I may distract this and tell myself no you should be busy with that you should be

27:01.040 --> 27:08.560
doing that so conscious processes are processes I define as processes in the mind that can be

27:08.560 --> 27:15.600
monitored that can be examined and that can be redirected of all the different different

27:15.600 --> 27:20.560
many different theories of consciousness though that I like the most the one that I think

27:21.280 --> 27:27.120
explained this is also was was complete is so-called global neural space theory

27:27.120 --> 27:36.240
theory and the most active active research is stony stony slas and what the global

27:36.240 --> 27:46.480
neural workspace analysis is that it is some kind of a special network the workspace which

27:46.480 --> 27:53.360
functions a bit like a kind of a forum or a meeting space where lots of different

27:53.360 --> 28:03.120
process is coming from and part of the building come together and the process in that workspace

28:03.120 --> 28:13.760
they are all what all circulate the other term other people people call it really

28:14.080 --> 28:21.200
or recurrence resonance but the main idea is it's a process a forward process that means

28:21.200 --> 28:29.360
a process that goes in one direction it's a process that that cycles around and what is the

28:29.360 --> 28:37.760
reason for the cycling problem with activation of neurons in the brain is that activation

28:37.760 --> 28:44.720
passed on new neurons do remain activated so you want to keep some keep some new working memory

28:45.760 --> 28:52.240
you need to recreate the activation and you can and you can only by having the active activation

28:52.240 --> 29:00.320
come back to the space and then that's for me now the essence of what creates the consciousness

29:00.320 --> 29:09.040
by keeping this total of this perception active in your memory you can inspect this

29:10.000 --> 29:15.760
and if you can inspect it that means other parts of the brain can look at this other

29:15.760 --> 29:22.160
other part of the brain intervening and is now what will create a free so I will

29:22.800 --> 29:32.080
it's best explained with owing so this is the scheme for the conscious processing the feet forward

29:32.080 --> 29:41.040
propagation so what you have is just a line the sensors some some condition there are a number

29:41.040 --> 29:48.080
of immediate new neural modules that process information for example if I see something

29:48.080 --> 29:55.600
there are different layers in my visual cortex that will first recognize light and dark and then

29:55.600 --> 30:03.760
recognize edges and then they will recognize shapes and then they recognize objects it leads

30:03.760 --> 30:13.920
a particular conclusion in the example I gave the of the hand on a hot stove

30:14.000 --> 30:22.240
here probably it may not even reach the brain it may just go to the spinal cord but

30:22.880 --> 30:31.200
the sensors send a signal that that eventually be pulled away by hands it just a fourth process

30:35.760 --> 30:43.120
so now of course processing that is what I call all circuiting active activation we have the

30:43.120 --> 30:51.840
sensors here on the bottom left left the sun provide input input the effect effectors my muscles

30:52.640 --> 31:01.120
are put on the system but before it reaches the effectors the activation circulates in what

31:01.120 --> 31:09.040
called the global workspace which is some kind of a a suit to be a network of on-range connections

31:09.040 --> 31:17.680
in the cortex and then you have the diff modules which are specialized circuits that for example

31:17.680 --> 31:28.960
recognize sounds or look openings or or make equations or or fractions the the most can be

31:29.760 --> 31:37.840
very diverse very specialist but these models now interact with what's going on in the workspace

31:37.840 --> 31:44.720
that means that what happens in the workspace the activation that's circulating can go to a

31:45.920 --> 31:53.760
to one of the modules which the module doesn't do anything with it on the other hand it can go to

31:53.760 --> 32:00.320
a module module reacts so it's an interaction action or there can be a module that receives

32:00.320 --> 32:06.720
infusion from a different part of the brain and that some some input in our workspace space so

32:06.720 --> 32:14.160
our workspace is seen as a kind of a form a kind of a public or all these specialized

32:14.160 --> 32:20.960
best circuits and they're in a kind of a discussion it's as if they are talking together in this

32:20.960 --> 32:29.280
global workspace space so here here there are some examples of from the of the where they are

32:29.280 --> 32:37.680
doing experiments with all these and you can give them here so-called sub-subliminals that

32:37.680 --> 32:43.840
means something that I think that a visual stimulus and disappears so quickly quickly that

32:43.840 --> 32:49.840
the monkey doesn't have the unconscious of it of it and you see this kind of a field of field

32:49.840 --> 32:57.840
activity that means that for the input the the the the neurons get directly activated and they pass

32:58.800 --> 33:05.600
their output to another of neurons but it moves basically in one direction on the other hand if

33:05.600 --> 33:12.320
you leave the stimulus for a long enough time that the monkey becomes conscious of it now that's

33:12.320 --> 33:19.200
what they call reverberation what I call circulation now you see that the different created neurons

33:19.600 --> 33:24.960
the sensation back and forth everything is keeping itself self-indulgent

33:28.640 --> 33:36.640
that is a standard model of consciousness or what is called access consciousness the

33:36.640 --> 33:43.760
consciousness in the sense that you have access to what's going on in your mind you have the ability

33:44.080 --> 33:51.360
to examine to monitor to read whatever is going on in your mind but now there is another aspect

33:51.360 --> 33:57.280
of consciousness that is subjective experience and associated with this with this whole

33:57.280 --> 34:06.720
problem of consciousness what is a subjective experience it is feeling that that is something

34:06.720 --> 34:13.600
that you are conscious and that subjective experience I personally prefer the term

34:13.600 --> 34:21.280
subjective experience but some other terms you may have heard are qualia acqua is an individual

34:21.280 --> 34:29.040
subjective experience it's also called phenomenal consciousness and a most common phase define what

34:29.040 --> 34:37.760
what a qualia or a subjective subjective experience that what is it like like to for example what what

34:37.760 --> 34:44.960
is it to see see hurt now typically typical example loss of his health healthness is subjective

34:44.960 --> 34:52.800
experiences is something else as an input but you have the subjective experience of healthness

34:53.760 --> 35:01.280
so the heart problem of consciousness is what precisely are these subjective experience

35:01.280 --> 35:08.880
why do we have these subjective experiences and the famous uh thought experiment that kind of

35:08.880 --> 35:14.640
hind the whole heart heart problem of conscious was uh discussed by the philosopher david

35:14.640 --> 35:21.600
charmer it's the zombie thought experiment so so what he does david david charmers he thinks that

35:21.600 --> 35:29.840
there are certain speech he calls zombies that behave just like any normal being but they don't

35:29.840 --> 35:40.080
have subjective experience so he imagines that the zombie would put his hands on a hot stove and the

35:40.080 --> 35:48.160
zombie would he would pull away his hands and ask the zombie what happens the the zombie will tell

35:48.160 --> 35:56.000
i felt hot pain but actually the zombie didn't feel any so the thought experiment is that the zombie

35:56.000 --> 36:00.080
behaves like a normal normal human being but actually he doesn't doesn't have subjective

36:00.080 --> 36:07.120
experience and then the heart problem is since by definition we cannot cannot see between a zombie

36:07.120 --> 36:14.720
and in a human being we cannot do a scientific experiment that we explain what the human being

36:14.720 --> 36:22.640
has subjective experience what the zombie likes yeah to me that is a meaningless thought

36:22.640 --> 36:28.480
experiment because if there is really no way that that i can distinguish only from a human human being

36:29.760 --> 36:36.320
all all of you can be or none of you of you can be zombies any of you can be a zombie to me that is

36:36.320 --> 36:45.440
not not a good way to good way to define it so let's explain something subjective explain

36:45.440 --> 36:52.800
my point the point of view first question a question that philosophers to my surprise

36:52.800 --> 37:01.840
have a lot of difficulties with why is experience subjective why i can't be just objectively see

37:01.840 --> 37:08.480
the way things things are so so for me it appears humans are autoplay systems

37:09.120 --> 37:16.880
autoplay systems as i said in me cannot objectively believe the world they do have access

37:16.880 --> 37:25.920
to opt out in the in the world they only have access to her perterops their self-maintaining

37:25.920 --> 37:32.160
processes whatever interferes with their metabolism if something interferes with my

37:32.160 --> 37:37.280
metabolism that means for for example that it leads to the releases of newer transmitters

37:37.280 --> 37:47.360
if in particle cells then i can feel that perturbation of my metabolism but but i do not access

37:48.160 --> 37:50.000
to think itself though

37:52.640 --> 37:59.520
the thing that follows so much from my theory of poyesis is is that autopoietic processes by

37:59.520 --> 38:07.920
definition they are not neutral they care about what happens to them they distinguish between

38:07.920 --> 38:15.200
good things and bad things whatever helps them to maintain themselves such as food

38:15.840 --> 38:23.280
they see as positive whatever interferes with the autopoietic such as a plate that can burn them

38:23.280 --> 38:31.280
they will see as negative so from an autopoietic point of view all all experiments of course

38:31.280 --> 38:39.600
happen from an internal thousand perspective i can only perceive the world from inside my own body

38:39.600 --> 38:48.400
inside my own brain and what i i perceive as neutral is not objective it is colored by

38:48.400 --> 38:57.440
my goals which is to stay alive and that is why for example have a different perception between

38:57.440 --> 39:07.040
let's say a butterfly and a wasp i butterflies i don't like wasps i know that wasps can be

39:07.040 --> 39:15.040
which will which will interfere with my autopoiesis so and biology might say you should be more you

39:15.040 --> 39:22.640
should be objective objective butterflies wasps are just insects but i'm likely to kill the

39:24.080 --> 39:26.320
the the wasp and not the butterfly

39:26.400 --> 39:29.120
so now

39:31.120 --> 39:39.200
so the subjective experience affects my autopoietic process so what does that mean

39:39.200 --> 39:45.760
effect i'm using using effect now so in the psychology also an effect is something that

39:45.760 --> 39:53.680
acts on all that means it pushes or pulls me pulls me towards it like for example for example it's

39:53.680 --> 39:59.360
if there is food i will be attracted to the food on the other hand it will push me away away from

39:59.360 --> 40:06.400
things are dangerous from disturbances it will push me away from the hot plate or from the wasp

40:07.680 --> 40:14.080
and that is a typical old world directed system there is a classic example of bacteria

40:14.400 --> 40:22.960
taxis bacteria can substance food molecules and toxin models and and they are to follow

40:23.440 --> 40:28.800
a gradient towards the food or away from the toxins so that's what we

40:30.000 --> 40:38.480
define elementary entry agency of the world directedness bacteria are affected by what

40:38.480 --> 40:45.680
happened at one effect there but there is not that conscious effects so now i finally

40:45.680 --> 40:54.480
turn to my solution of the heart problem of business it's what i call local field model

40:54.480 --> 41:02.640
i've also been the local prospect model so effects are equivalent to four these things that push push

41:02.640 --> 41:11.840
or pull on the other hand godness tells me that i don't just just immediately react react take the

41:11.840 --> 41:18.240
time to come to consider our different different process that push and pull in different direction

41:18.240 --> 41:27.760
so there is a range of potential actions now a range is something like a space if i put a force

41:27.760 --> 41:34.640
across a range i get what in mathematics or in physics called a field i could have presented

41:34.640 --> 41:42.320
as a kind of a vector field across a space of potential potentiality that means potential

41:42.320 --> 41:50.320
reactions i i would have but but this i do not do not know what one under all circumstances

41:50.320 --> 41:56.720
there is this cognitive the field the field is flow emanates from the here the here now

41:57.360 --> 42:08.880
and the farther away in space of time the less my my idea will be what what the field is

42:10.800 --> 42:19.120
so how how can we even this local field in the brain i go back to my to my picture of the

42:19.120 --> 42:24.800
workspace there is a circling activation so in the global space there is this this

42:24.800 --> 42:31.920
phase activation but the activation to some the greeks it's a process process spreading

42:31.920 --> 42:40.240
activation in uh in psychomes i think that are are asserts that are related to that are in the

42:40.240 --> 42:47.280
global workspace will receive some leaking activation and that leaking activation in a

42:47.280 --> 42:54.560
sense pairs the way for potentially the next action or the next total or the next interpretation

42:55.360 --> 43:03.440
so the diffusing activation diffusing from the global workspace that's a sense forms

43:03.440 --> 43:10.160
the local the local post which to to be is the subjective experience

43:11.120 --> 43:14.080
uh we'll skip that that one

43:16.080 --> 43:24.240
so this local field it's a conceptual model the reason that nowadays i prefer to call it local

43:24.240 --> 43:29.440
prospect is that that's the first time i started explaining it to people working consciousness

43:30.160 --> 43:36.800
everybody i assumed that i was imagining some some kind of a mechanical field

43:36.880 --> 43:44.160
emanating from my my brain and the field is purely a mathematical concept or a

43:44.160 --> 43:49.440
conceptual model it's not a physical physical field on the other hand on the other hand i'm using

43:49.440 --> 43:54.720
field because because field is something you can explain matter in matter so that means that

43:54.720 --> 44:01.600
potentially i hope that they will eventually be able to make a mathematical model or computer

44:01.600 --> 44:05.520
model of what the subjective experience would be

44:08.480 --> 44:15.600
so in consciousness we speak about about so-called neural correlates of core consciousness

44:16.160 --> 44:22.640
the subjective experience that you feel the neural correlates the activity that is actually

44:22.640 --> 44:30.320
not noticeable in the brain and this neural correlate format for me it's a term that i took

44:30.320 --> 44:39.600
from uh the neural uh uh that was steven goes i call it an adaptive resonance resonance because

44:39.600 --> 44:46.800
it is kind of self-maintaining circulation of activity adaptive because it constantly adapts

44:46.800 --> 44:54.000
to things to inputs and outputs so there's activation that is kind of self-maintaining

44:54.000 --> 45:01.280
within work memory in the global global workspace that activation in and out of out of the resonance

45:01.280 --> 45:08.960
like that it moved one direction action all year and initially the activation again can

45:08.960 --> 45:16.800
do the different actions and then and then it assists it choose the action rather than

45:16.800 --> 45:22.400
the other potential it's a little bit available to the collapse of the wave function in quantum

45:22.480 --> 45:29.120
mechanics if your field of activation is diffusing can be seen as a wave then at a certain moment

45:29.120 --> 45:35.680
when you make a decision to do this or that it's like like the wave of it but then immediately

45:35.680 --> 45:48.640
when it starts spreading again so five free willful uh i see brain as a elective specialized

45:48.640 --> 45:56.000
modules these as modules or circuits we can see them as kind of agents within the society of mind

45:56.800 --> 46:04.640
these agents interact they have a discussion the discussion takes place in these global

46:04.640 --> 46:13.200
workspaces and why is the world free because you can say beforehand what the art of discussion

46:13.200 --> 46:20.080
will be it's as if you different different people with different unions and different different

46:20.080 --> 46:28.400
backgrounds ever to get about whatever whatever political problem you do not know beforehand

46:28.400 --> 46:33.760
what solution they will come out on art because they are they are confronted with perspectives

46:33.760 --> 46:40.640
that have not been confronted before as each speaks in turn that means there is a very strong

46:40.640 --> 46:48.320
effect of who speaks when timing state date etc you cannot predict what discussion will be

46:50.160 --> 46:55.520
it's a non-linear process that means that it's subject to what's called it's called the butterfly

46:55.520 --> 47:02.080
effect meaning meaning that very differences in activation of timing can can lead to these outcomes

47:02.880 --> 47:09.120
in other words whole process isn't predictable why we call it for it free it is not it's not

47:09.120 --> 47:18.560
deterministic so again the same picture the society of mind now now we look at the modules

47:18.560 --> 47:24.240
as if they are agents each agent has certain opinions certain things that are particularly

47:24.240 --> 47:31.840
important certain things you know certain things it's good at and that's agent is is

47:32.480 --> 47:39.520
some of its opinion in the workspace is where all the agents can react to it and their opinion

47:39.520 --> 47:46.720
opinion to it whole thing is is evaluated in interaction different agents agency

47:48.400 --> 47:55.760
so here i go back to the picture i i took from michael where he speaks about compound intelligence

47:55.920 --> 48:03.920
is cells together have a higher level of intelligent cognition than individual cells

48:03.920 --> 48:10.640
be because they interact act because they are in this kind of kind of discussion the same thing

48:10.640 --> 48:17.280
for for organisms like arms same for you or humans at each level each level we can

48:17.760 --> 48:21.280
cognition mission is beauty is collective if

48:23.280 --> 48:30.000
so the the moments are different agents that become coupled that means that they are in some

48:30.000 --> 48:36.000
relationship that's relatively stable i know that they will exchange new information because one

48:36.000 --> 48:42.160
will react what the other one does the orbit of the one becomes becomes the input of the other

48:42.160 --> 48:50.560
and vice versa cells travel from from agent to agent and and that allows a more this or

48:50.560 --> 49:00.080
collective intelligent my first example was a bacterial cell apopoietic network network that

49:00.080 --> 49:05.680
consists of actions each of the action of the action of the molecules is you might say a very

49:06.000 --> 49:11.840
primitive that is in acting with all the others to gather they form apopoietic network

49:12.720 --> 49:19.360
when i look at the human brain i the agents are different models that are helping putting their

49:19.360 --> 49:25.280
discussion in the global workspace and finally in society we might say different people are

49:25.280 --> 49:30.640
discussing in what we call the northern north sphere the worldwide crop crop the

49:31.600 --> 49:35.440
uh gen genitals fee in which communications are

49:38.080 --> 49:48.640
fine finally in russian what i have to do is to do a kind of a natural history of agency starting

49:48.640 --> 49:55.760
from the very simplest agents which are the outcome of reaction networks that self-organize

49:56.400 --> 50:01.520
these reaction networks tend to become but close and self-containing meaning that they are

50:01.520 --> 50:10.320
autopoietic as simple apopoietic systems are uh uh they're going for the innovations they need to

50:10.320 --> 50:16.160
learn to adapt to adapt that means they need to learn to learn to condition action action rules

50:16.160 --> 50:21.600
you know in this in this condition i need to perform perform this action to survive fine

50:22.320 --> 50:27.920
and in human brains we have the additional stage of consciousness that means that the

50:27.920 --> 50:34.560
condition action rules are no longer automatic condition automatically leading to action

50:34.560 --> 50:42.400
thus we will get an intermediate stage of of circulation where activate thoughts feelings

50:42.400 --> 50:49.120
are serrating in what's called the global journal workspace that circulation defines

50:49.120 --> 50:55.440
a local possible possible development months out of these these potential demands

50:56.480 --> 51:02.080
eventually chosen and the one that is one that is is chosen collectively collaboratively

51:02.880 --> 51:12.320
by the different models are discussing so uh i think we still have time for a few questions

51:12.320 --> 51:18.960
great thank you um any questions

51:21.840 --> 51:29.280
sure i'll ask a question this is chris um thanks thanks for your talk

51:31.600 --> 51:35.680
you characterize the environment as a source of perturbations

51:35.920 --> 51:44.960
and you also mentioned that autopoiesis is an attractor in the state space of a complex system

51:45.920 --> 51:50.800
so do you consider the environment to be itself an autopoietic system

51:53.120 --> 52:02.000
uh that's an interesting term uh this is part of a broader perspective which are relational

52:02.000 --> 52:08.880
agency if if you look at an ecosystem you can see the system as a as a whole as a

52:08.880 --> 52:16.560
poetic system in the in the sense that there are flows of uh was it being consumed consumed

52:16.560 --> 52:23.040
and produced so an ecosystem a whole would also be an autopoietic system in that sense

52:24.880 --> 52:29.600
okay great thank you

52:32.000 --> 52:34.880
anyone else

52:37.360 --> 52:44.880
um hi uh i do i do have a question um could you elaborate a little bit about uh your response

52:44.880 --> 52:51.840
to the zombie criticism or are you are you thinking that uh a zombie autopoietic system

52:51.840 --> 53:01.600
cannot exist uh what exactly are your thoughts there this curious okay uh uh it's it's a kind

53:01.600 --> 53:09.040
of a metaphysical assumption uh which which light means the identity of the indistinguishables

53:09.680 --> 53:17.200
so what's given by that is if you cannot distinguish two things if there is no no you can say

53:18.160 --> 53:23.200
i have only here and i have a human here i can distinguish the one from the other some way

53:24.080 --> 53:30.720
then the identity of the distinctions zombies are humans so so for me

53:30.720 --> 53:37.600
isolating a distinction lead to any other the other distinction is meaningless yes another way

53:37.600 --> 53:43.200
to formulate it is it's called the difference that makes it if you start by postulating a

53:43.200 --> 53:48.880
difference between zombies and humans then it should make some other difference just postulating

53:48.880 --> 53:55.920
a difference that does not lead to any any difference to me it's useful that it's making

53:55.920 --> 54:05.920
things complicated that shouldn't be made complicated so the the main question really

54:05.920 --> 54:10.880
for me is is why do we subjective experience experience why do we something for example

54:11.360 --> 54:19.440
if we look at and and we feel because the as the color is a signal that has certain meaning

54:19.440 --> 54:26.320
for us that we have associated for example with the warm or with action and that makes us do certain

54:26.320 --> 54:33.760
things harder than others so the color that will influence me in a different way than the color

54:33.760 --> 54:42.000
blue and that is what the subjective experience is yeah i the way i always understood the zombie

54:42.000 --> 54:48.880
criticism was that subjective experiences is not necessary to do the kind of things that

54:50.160 --> 54:55.600
organisms as complex as humans can do but we do have subjective experience which

54:56.560 --> 55:01.840
is it may have been a product of evolution and maybe it plays a a role
