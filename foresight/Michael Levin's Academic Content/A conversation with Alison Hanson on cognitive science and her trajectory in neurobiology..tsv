0	1720	Yeah, thanks so much for joining me. How are you doing?
2360	4680	Awesome. And thank you very, very much for having me. I'm
4680	6280	excited. This is going to be fun.
7200	9960	Yeah, yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. Yeah, I want I
9960	12160	want to shine the light on some of the younger people that are
12160	14200	doing some amazing stuff. And I'm really excited about your
14200	14760	work. So
15440	17040	thank you. Yeah, me too.
18160	21320	Cool. Yeah, so maybe maybe just, you know, introduce yourself
21320	23800	where you are now. And we'll we'll go from there.
24200	28880	Totally. So I am Ali Hansen and I'm in Raphael Usain Lab here at
28880	34120	Columbia. And how did I don't know that it's time yet to go into
34120	36480	a full background, but I'll just suffice it to say that I've
36480	41000	completed my psychiatry residency. But my background was in
41000	47600	sort of selling of developmental biology, and sort of jumped
47600	50720	into the field of neuroscience and using Hydra as a model
50720	55240	system to sort of study, let's say, to be able to see the whole
55280	59200	nervous system at once. And from there, what really interested
59200	63360	me is the role of spontaneous neural activity, neural activity
63360	66760	that's going on when the animal is not behaving. So I'm now a
66760	70960	postdoc finishing that and in the process of figuring out where
70960	72840	I'll go next to start my own group.
74280	76960	Yeah, yeah, why don't you maybe talk a little bit about your
76960	79840	background and just kind of your journey as far back as makes
79840	81240	sense of how you got here.
81640	87840	Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I mean, I think, I think maybe far, far
87840	92800	back, I'll just broad overview of a person from Iowa thinking, I
92800	94680	don't know, no one else is probably paying attention to
94680	97920	basketball, but Caitlin Clark, it went to my high school and
97920	101360	she's the newest phenom. And so I thought, I wrote on my thing,
101360	104440	I was going to play basketball in the WNBA and then I never
104440	111000	grew, but ended up playing basketball in college, and studied
111000	114720	molecular biology, and ended up doing MD PhD program. And my
114720	118240	PhD at that point was in, yeah, so cell and developmental
118240	120560	biology and the molecular mechanisms of wind signaling, so
120560	125640	very, very molecular. And so I got sort of trained in that,
125680	131880	that belief system that molecules are king. And that sort of
131880	135240	explains, you know, not only how cells work, but how
135240	139600	development works. And so my thesis was on that sort of the
139600	141880	molecular mechanisms of wind signaling and ubiquit relation
141880	145280	and these kinds of things. But then luckily, someone clued me
145280	149800	in to the physiology course at the MBL in Woods Hole, which sort
149800	153280	of was like, Oh, there's a whole other way to do this, you can
153280	156760	sort of really zoom out and interact with other people, and
156800	159480	in many other different disciplines, right? So there I
159480	163480	was with peer mathematicians, physicists, computational
164560	167600	scientists and people who had no experience with biology and I
167600	170240	was the biologist coming in. And so it was like this awesome
170480	174440	thing, right? Where you go and you do two weeks with different
174440	176040	scientists on different projects and get really
176040	180000	exposed to totally different ways of thinking. And in that, I
180000	183280	ended up with Goudon's Danizer, actually, as one of my mentors,
183280	185840	and I did a two week course on modeling three proteins in the
185840	189640	wind pathway. And I was like, Oh, wow, like you can really start
189640	193080	learning something really counterintuitive, something that
193080	196240	you wouldn't know by just saying, Hey, you're going to draw
196800	199480	the cell signaling pathway in a two dimensional piece of paper
199480	201400	and draw a bunch of arrows and that's understanding. I was
201400	204000	like, Oh, shit, that doesn't actually explain anything, right?
204160	207520	So yeah, that that was sort of my first worry. And then of
207520	210480	course, the likes of like Mark Kirschner and Andrew Murray were
210480	213240	on the chalkboard doing all kinds of these things. And it was
213240	215760	like, Oh, there's a different way to do this to find the
215760	218920	simplest system possible, and try to model as much of it as you
218920	221880	can to gain some understanding. And of course, that was right
221880	224880	the end my PhD. So I didn't have time to sort of implement that
224880	228800	and then went back to do medical training. And then I took
228800	231760	another foray, which I think is important to how I ended up
231760	236640	doing this kind of resume right now, which is art. So I left
237040	240000	in the middle of my MD PhD training to go study painting in
240000	244320	Santa Fe, New Mexico, with an amazing person who is Tony
244320	247600	Rider, and that totally changed sort of, this is going to sound
247600	254480	nuts, but how I see and the way I think it sort of opened up my
254480	259840	mind to like, how you approach reality with a fixed idea. And
259840	262320	so I went in there and I'm like, Oh, I got to paint here was so
262320	264280	it was it was classical realism. So you're trying to be
264280	267440	portraiture and nude models drawing and painting. I didn't
267440	269720	have any experience with this really at all, except for you
269720	274920	know, childhood classes or something. And going in there
274920	278640	just for an example of like, Oh, a shadow is dark, just black,
278840	282040	or something is like, no, as long as you have this belief,
282480	285560	you'll never paint a shadow as it actually is because there's
285560	288360	no such thing as pure black in nature, or reality, right?
288360	290640	There's always some amount of light, some amount of color,
290640	293680	something. And I remember so Ted South Jacobs was Tony's
293680	296640	teacher is a very similar sort of lineage in art and science,
297400	300080	who wrote a whole book on the anatomy of human forms. Like if
300080	303080	you paint a human eyeball that looks like an almond with a
303080	307400	circle in it, you'll never ever paint an eyeball that is true to
307400	309720	reality. So it's kind of like, Oh, all of these concepts that
309760	313360	I'm laying on top of these things are not real. Like it can I
313360	316400	get rid of those things? That was part of that exercise for two
316400	321120	years of trying to like, unlearn all of the things I had been
321120	325920	told about what a human, you know, is and the features of it in
325920	328320	order to paint what it actually is. And at the same time, there
328320	333480	was a upaya Zen Center was in the back yard of this place. So I
333480	337080	learned Zen brain, which is about conscious complex adaptive
337080	339320	systems and all of this kind of stuff. Also Santa Fe
339360	342080	Institute was there. So I was just all over doing all this
342080	346520	stuff and taking all kinds of classes around all of that. And
346520	349720	ultimately sort of, you know, I was I was debating, do I go
349720	352440	paint full time? Do I do a postdoc? And if I was going to
352440	355120	just do a straight postdoc, I was going to do on the origin of
355120	359240	multicellularity, right? Like, how do you go from one cell to a
359240	362080	group of cells? That was what I was interested in. But then, you
362080	365320	know, I got interested in like, I really want to help people in
365320	369920	quotes. And I want to do that through sort of psychiatry. So
369920	372520	it's our way to put all of that stuff together. And I was like,
372520	374560	well, shit, now I'm going to have to switch fields and study
374560	379400	neuroscience. Which I was like, that's not at the time, I'm
379400	381680	sorry, any neuroscience is out there. But like, that's not
381680	385000	science. That's not molecular. What is that? It's, it's a you're
385000	387520	putting a human in fMRI skin, you're looking at blood flowing
387520	389320	all around. You're not even looking at neural activity. It
389320	391200	was like, this isn't understanding. This isn't
391200	394120	mechanism. Because for me, mechanism, what's the amino
394120	397520	acid on the protein? That that's a mechanism, right? That was the
397520	400320	kind of thinking. But going to that Zen brain conference
400320	402840	actually was was one of those things we're like, oh, some of
402840	405840	these questions, you just can't reduce to an amino acid and a
405840	409360	protein, like that that model that that way of thinking doesn't
409520	413640	doesn't compute here. So there was a lot of, you know, things
413640	419000	going all around. But then, yeah, deciding, okay, I'm going to
419000	421840	pursue a residency in psychiatry and try to figure out what is
421840	423800	neuroscience. And so like, you had to do all these interviews,
423800	426360	and I was just essentially using the residency interview as a
426360	430040	postdoc interview to say, who's doing neuroscience? Where? What
430040	433200	are they up to? And what level of scalar people studying all of
433200	439720	this? I was just trying to see the lay of the land. Yeah, and I
439720	443000	remember, I think, actually, at one point, somehow got a hold of
443000	446280	Sidney Brenner, when he was in the hospital in Singapore, and
446280	449560	I was like, Hey, what level scale do you think we should be
449560	452400	doing this? You know, studying the nervous system? And I'm
452400	454720	pretty sure I can't even remember his answer, but it was like
454720	457800	single cells, you could go down, you can go up and this kind of
457800	462720	thing. And so that kind of question of, of where, how do
462720	466560	you tackle this problem? And then I ended up reading Rafa's
466560	468520	articles, George Church and Scientific American around that
468520	471240	time of like, you know, using complex adaptive systems theory
471240	473200	to study the brain, you need to see the whole thing. I'm like,
473200	479320	Yes. So on that interview, I then talked to Rafa, and he had a
479320	482000	hydra on the screen, and it was just one of those moments where
482040	486840	I'm like, No way. This is amazing. This is this is exactly
486840	489400	what I've been looking for, like all of my dreams coming true on
489400	494040	the screen, like it's a simple system. You can see the whole
494040	497480	thing, you know, I don't know. And it's like, it has a lot of
497480	499920	it, you know, obviously, rich history and cell and developmental
499920	503160	biology, evolution, like it was all together. And one thing
503160	507520	I'm like, All right, that's what I'm gonna have to do. And,
507920	512120	yeah, in early saw that there was this spontaneous neural
512120	514920	activity in that animal. And I was like, What is this? Right?
514920	517560	What is that? And that got me very curious about where else that
517560	519640	was found, which leads to the human brain and all of these
519640	523800	things and, and the self and all of that. So it sort of all was
523800	526280	coming together. And then I was sort of, you know, seeing
526280	530120	patients as a resident. And then had a little bit of research
530120	532280	time. So I was like, really reading and thinking and looking
532280	536680	and, and all of that. Yeah, and I mean, I'll just disclose to
536680	539760	you that I'm a, I'm a Zen student. And so it was also a
539760	543160	scientist of my own mind. So I've been, you know, exploring it
543160	550080	from that angle. A lot. So first person point of view and third
550080	554160	person with patience. And then, you know, the in quotes, third
554160	557600	person objective view of the system too. So there's all of
557600	563720	that at play all the time. So yeah, that's the longest version
563720	564600	I can muster.
565880	569320	Yeah, yes, very interesting. The art at the art angle, I think
569320	573680	is also is also quite quite interesting. I do know, you know,
573680	576600	I can't draw anything like that. But I do a bunch of photography
576600	579600	and I agree with you that that watching the light and like
580080	582640	trying to trying to capture what you actually see or what you
582640	587600	think you see is an interesting component of it. Yeah. How do
587600	591600	you, how do you think about I'm curious, since you have you have
591600	595080	a background in molecular genetics and also now neuroscience?
596040	599120	How do you think about the kinds of things that those systems
599120	602160	are good at? Like how are how are molecular dynamics and the
602160	604800	kinds of things you get out of those different from what you
604800	608520	can get out of out of, you know, for example, electrophysiology,
608520	610800	you know, in terms of the computations, the usage, like
610800	612880	how are the how what's different about those systems?
613880	617000	You mean like sort of at the cellular level versus the system
617000	619000	level or like the neural?
619560	622040	I mean, I mean, if you were going to if you were going to
622040	626000	build things and your options were gene regulatory networks
626000	630400	and diffusion versus electrical networks and synaptic kinds of
630400	635400	things, what are the different, you know, dynamics that you can
635400	637520	expect to get out of those systems? How are they different
637520	638080	functionally?
638440	643760	Yes, great question. I mean, ultimately, this is what I sort
643760	648120	of, I mean, this isn't any big idea or anything. It's just like
648160	655120	one of them is slower, right? So like molecules diffusing limits
655120	660280	you I think in space and time. Whereas electricity, right,
660480	665320	allows speed and distance. So it just speeds up processes, right?
665320	667440	So I don't think there's anything particularly special
667440	673560	about neurons. I think you agree with that, right? They did. I
673560	676440	don't know. And if we're talking about, let's say memory or
676440	678720	computation, any of those things, those can be implemented in
678720	682640	any, any material, right? There's nothing special about
682640	685840	neurons, this can happen in those molecules, if you put them
685840	688800	together in certain ways, and you maintain a pattern, right,
688800	691080	that's relevant to the organism, that can be implemented in the
691080	697080	molecules. But it just sort of limits, I would say, yeah, the
697080	700760	space and time of that that molecules are on a shorter like
700760	707160	length scale, obviously, and take longer to move and
707160	710400	communicate, whereas you can send electricity much faster over
710400	716080	a longer distance. So yeah, I don't know if that's answering
716120	720240	what you're asking, but that's sort of how I think about it.
720440	723600	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree. That's that's definitely, that's
723600	726240	definitely an important, an important feature. You know,
726240	729320	people people sometimes ask me like, what's what's magical
729320	731280	about bio electricity, like what's different about
731280	734520	electrical networks, that's harder, or maybe even even not
734520	738200	doable in typical molecular, you know, the kinds of kinds of
738200	739320	networks. Yeah.
739600	743360	Right. And I mean, because I, what I mean, I'm just thinking of
743360	747840	this, like, intuitively, at some point of like, you know, what
747840	750840	do we as human beings use to communicate, we use electricity
750840	753440	because it's the fastest thing, use the smallest thing in
753440	756880	electron that can go the fastest, right? And that's how we
756920	760840	connect globally via the internet and all of this. So of
760840	765160	course, nature would be using the same thing. And I remember
765160	768160	looking it's up at some point in one of your papers, right, of
768160	771320	like, when you get a wound, the first thing that happens is
771320	773800	electrical communication, and then the molecules. And then I
773800	776320	was at some point thinking like, one of the things I did, I
776320	779640	mean, shit, every day all day was running Jell-O-Lusher
779640	783520	freezes in a lab, right? Yeah, you're generating an electric
783520	788480	field to put your proteins where you want them. Why would it
788480	792840	nature be doing that, right? Itself, organizing itself using
792840	796000	electricity. So the molecules are sort of, you know, and as you
796000	800480	know, it's both bottom off and top down. But that, you know,
800480	802560	you're using electricity because it's the fastest way to
802560	805960	communicate from head to tail, let's say, in this organism,
805960	809400	some things up on this end, and then you bring the molecules
809400	815680	over there. Yeah. So for me, it's about sort of, yeah, speed
815680	818640	and distance. That's what I would say. Yeah.
819200	823240	Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, so what kind of what are you working on
823240	826320	now, talk to, you know, talk about? Totally. Yeah. And I
826320	831320	mean, I don't know, I have a few slides I could go up, bring up
831320	844480	here. Yeah. If you can see, I can't see that. Right. So this
844480	847800	isn't, we don't really have to do a formal formal thing, but
847920	851440	don't do as much as you want. Yeah, this is sort of the gist of
851440	855040	it, right? As I've alluded to is what is going on with this
855040	859960	spontaneous neural activity. And this would be an outline of
859960	862480	like sort of why somebody like me, mostly interested in
862480	865520	studying something like the human brain is some interested
865520	868880	in studying as something as simple as this hydra. And then
868920	871120	sort of that brings us into some kind of history of the
871120	874440	spontaneous neural activity, what it might be doing, the tools
874440	877360	needed to study that hydra and some of these future directions.
877360	879520	And so I don't know how much we have time for, but I'll just
879560	884440	kind of go as quickly as possible. And this is one of my
884440	887520	favorite things to start with to say, like, just imagine that
887520	890040	you're a scientist, and you're the first person to ever see an
890040	893000	image that looks like this, which is exactly what happened to
893000	895760	Golgi when he put the Golgi sound neural, like a nervous system
895760	897840	for the first time, and you're trying to make sense of what is
897840	903080	this. And he thought that this is just one giant reticular
903080	906080	mesh work. It's all one thing. And other people at this time
906080	908840	looked at basically the same image and saw something else. And
908840	911800	they zoomed in on these little shapes here would look like
911800	914560	these little pyramidal things. So Sherrington and Ramonica Hall
914560	917000	say, Oh, what about these little pyramidal things? Like, what
917120	919440	those are how this works? What are those are the functional
919440	921160	units of this system?
921320	925400	By the way, sorry, could I ask the Golgi stain? Was that random?
925400	927920	Was he just trying random chemicals? Or did he have some
927920	930080	idea that that was going to stain something interesting?
930360	932720	I have no idea. Honestly, I would have to look that's a great
932720	936000	question that he like why how that ended up happening. But
936000	940080	before that, like, there was no ability to sort of see what it
940080	942560	looked like. So there was all kinds of speculations, I think
942560	945880	on behavior and all of that, but no real way to see or
945880	950840	visualize the nervous system. And then what you do, then you've
950840	953080	got to make sense of it, right? I think like, this is just a
953080	955840	fundamental thing about science. It's like, first of all, the
955840	958080	method that you use to view the thing will determine what you
958080	961840	see. And this is exactly what happens in Neil Thies. We'll
961840	965320	talk about this. And so this was happening at the same time as
967600	970360	you know, cell theory with Schleiden Schwann, because at
970360	973840	that time, they see cell boundaries, they see lipid
973840	976600	membranes. And so they're like, Oh, what the functional unit of
976600	980880	that system of non neural tissues is cells. But Neil will make
980880	984000	the point, if you had just had a nuclear stain, what you would
984000	987840	have seen is just a bunch of dots floating in liquid, you
987840	989280	wouldn't have known that there were these things called
989280	992600	membranes as you had sort of an Eastern conception of what's the
992600	996280	functional unit of tissue, right? It would be like, Oh, it's
996280	999680	fluid with a bunch of dots floating in it. So here, you
999680	1002820	have this at the beginning, right, like this whole picture of a
1002820	1007860	nervous system. And then you're arbitrarily deciding which
1007860	1012420	parts are separate from the rest. And so the decision at that
1012420	1015380	point was sort of, we're going to go with cell theory, and the
1015380	1017900	neuron doctrine that these little pyramidal shaped things are
1017900	1022660	the units. And at the same time, Sherrington was going nuts on
1022700	1028700	in reflex arcs. So that sort of solidified this idea that the
1028740	1031340	not only the structural unit might be a single neuron, but
1031340	1033740	the functional one, because you hit your knee, you get one
1033740	1036780	sensory neuron that goes in synapses on another motor neuron
1036780	1039940	your spinal cord, and that's your reflex, right? So that sort
1039940	1043940	of gave them two ideas. A, that single neurons are the
1043940	1046060	functional units. And that B, the nervous system is doing
1046060	1048940	nothing unless you stimulate it from the outside. So those are
1048940	1053940	just these two sort of major paradigms taken from mostly
1053940	1056980	spinal cord peripheral nervous system is sort of applied to the
1056980	1062140	cortex. And that must be how it works. But I would argue that
1062140	1065700	those two major ideas have left us in a situation where you
1065700	1069700	still don't really know the true functional unit, at least of
1069700	1074460	cortex or non spinal cord peripheral nervous systems
1074580	1078460	really are. Is it multiple neurons? Is it all one thing? Is
1078460	1081540	it some amount of, let's say, ensemble, how many neurons are
1081540	1084700	in ensemble? How do those things interact to generate
1084740	1088060	complex cognitive states? And how do those go awry in
1088060	1089340	neuropsychiatric disorders?
1089740	1093380	Do you think that? Do you think there's a single objective
1093380	1096420	answer to that question? Like, is there a, you know, the the
1096420	1100660	optimal subunit or is that where do you think it's more of a
1100860	1102820	observer dependent kind of, you know,
1103220	1107420	Oh my God, yes, we got to skip his head till like 20 slides
1107420	1107900	from now. But
1108340	1109660	no problem. Keep keep keep going.
1109660	1112660	Totally. And yeah, and I think I think it's I think there's
1112780	1115660	again, what I'm most interested in, which I think most people
1115660	1118140	are, are general principles. And I think this is going to be,
1118260	1120500	there'll be general principles in that there's not one answer of
1120500	1122860	like, what a functional unit is in a particular system, but the
1122860	1127940	general way that that works, I think will probably be general.
1130260	1132980	And so yeah, I don't need to introduce a complex adaptive
1132980	1138020	system to you, but maybe other people, if anyone ever sees
1138020	1142260	this would be interested. So basically, it's just you have a
1142260	1145980	bunch of individual simple systems or subunits, right at this
1145980	1150300	level of scale. And I should just say that why am I talking about
1150300	1152940	that? I'm saying because if the brain is actually this complex
1152940	1156340	adaptive system, maybe we're studying at the wrong level of
1156340	1158420	scale, we can't see the functional units because we're
1158420	1161900	studying one thing at a time. So this is a bunch of units,
1161900	1163580	right, these can be anything, these can be electrons in the
1163580	1166020	magnet, water molecules and water, ants and ant colony birds
1166020	1168660	and flock or neurons in a nervous system. The key is you put
1168660	1171100	enough of them together and they follow simple rules. And if we
1171100	1174060	just think of this as an electron simplest example, you
1174060	1176220	have an electron that spin up and its neighbors spin down and
1176220	1178860	it needs to become a spin down. And you put enough of them
1178860	1180980	together and critically that won't happen with one electron or
1180980	1183940	10 electrons and it's a property of many electrons, you get this
1183980	1186140	emergent phenomenon of the higher level scale. In this case,
1186140	1189380	it'd be like magnetism, right? And then that higher level scale
1189380	1193260	can feedback down and coordinate and constrain the lower lower
1193260	1196180	level. And the key here right is that you you're never going to
1196180	1199300	see magnetism if you're looking at this level here at this
1199300	1202660	single electron, you're only going to see it up here if
1202660	1205020	you're looking at a higher level of scale. And that level of
1205020	1207540	scale also is going to be following sort of totally
1207540	1210900	different rules than this level of scale. So if that's what
1210900	1213020	we're trying to do in neuroscience in general, we
1213020	1217500	think of this as a TV screen. Like, you know, for the most of
1217500	1219180	the history of neuroscience, we've been doing these single
1219180	1221900	pixels at a time, you know, single unit electrophysiology,
1221900	1224860	which of course is critical, we need to do that, we had to
1224860	1228140	understand what a neuron is, and doing that one at a time, but
1228140	1231660	you can't really see the whole picture at once. Alternatively,
1231740	1236340	you can zoom out and do things like I was saying MRI, EEG, MEG,
1236340	1239180	these kinds of things, you get a global view, but it's very low
1239180	1241500	spatial temporal resolution. So you can sort of tell that
1241500	1244100	something's happening. But it's hard to sort of see what that
1244100	1247660	is. So the ultimate goal then, right, is to just look at that
1247660	1251380	TV screen with single pixel resolution to sort of see, okay,
1251500	1253660	now that we can see all these individual neurons, what picture
1253660	1256220	is emerging at this higher level scale, what can we see by just
1256220	1260420	looking at it, right? And again, I'm interested in this big
1260420	1263420	thing here, the human brain, given that I'm interested in the
1263420	1267180	human mind and helping these kinds of folks. But it's huge,
1267180	1270100	it's 86 billion neurons with trillions of connections, it's
1270100	1272300	not going to fit under the microscope and all of that. So
1272300	1275500	you can simplify that problem, you can do it in a mouse brain,
1275620	1277260	right? But even here, how are you going to get all this
1277260	1279700	hardware in here, record all those neurons, and even if you
1279700	1283060	do that optically, if I don't know, right now, we're up to,
1283060	1286300	let's say, let's be generous, I think I'm really arresting by
1286300	1290380	saying 20,000 neurons, that's out of 71 million. So it's just
1290380	1295460	really not much of the whole TV screen, let's say. So you could
1295460	1299260	simplify this even further. And you can do zebrafish, right?
1299300	1301980	And Drosophila and even CL again, but even these systems are
1301980	1305380	still quite complex. Depending on the, you know, developed stage
1305380	1307900	of the zebrafish, you can have up to 10 million neurons still
1307900	1311100	and lots of different cell types, and they're all, I think,
1311220	1314980	importantly, sort of shoved together in these complex brains
1314980	1318700	and ganglia that are also sort of hard to disentangle. So
1318700	1323580	Sidney Brenner sat down with my mentor, Rafa, who we all know,
1323580	1328060	Sidney was the one who pioneered the work on C. elegans. And he
1328060	1331020	said, that's even still too complicated, right? What if we
1331020	1333900	try something even simpler? Let's do Hydra, which has 200 to
1333900	1336260	2000 neurons, depending on the size of the animal. And
1336380	1339460	depending on how you cut off the cell sequencing, single cell
1339460	1343060	sequencing data, you get 11 to 12, maybe 13 different neural
1343060	1347580	cell types. And it doesn't have a true brain or ganglia as you'll
1347580	1353860	see momentarily. I gotta get that off there. Okay, I say. Right.
1353860	1358220	So then it also not only is it simple, but it's an interesting
1358220	1360620	position on the evolutionary tree, at least as far as I'm
1360620	1365820	concerned, it's right after and quotes the non neural lineage,
1365820	1368380	and then right before the bilaterians, which is the branch
1368380	1372740	of life that we're sort of used to studying. And neuroscience,
1372820	1374940	where you have a central midline structure structure and a
1374940	1378940	left and a right side. Whereas the Nigerians are sort of
1378940	1381300	totally radially symmetric, they don't have any of those
1381300	1384700	things. So it's it's another instance where you can sort of
1384700	1387100	say, Hey, what are these general principles? This nervous
1387100	1390220	system looks nothing like that one. And yet it's able to
1390220	1394100	generate complex behavior. Does it matter what the
1394100	1397180	architecture of this nervous system is? Because it's
1397180	1400100	seemingly, right? Everyone's very interested and obsessed with
1400100	1403660	getting those the circuit diagrams, right? But does that
1403660	1405820	matter? Can you get complete essentially the same
1405820	1410700	functionality out of completely different architectures? And I
1410700	1416500	think that's probably what we'll find if we look. How do I go
1416500	1420100	forward? Oh, there we go. So, so this is just what an actual
1420100	1423620	hydra looks like with its mouth, tentacles, foot, and then this
1423620	1427820	hydra buds. So this is going to be important in a second,
1427820	1431700	because hydra can reproduce asexually. So hydra essentially
1431700	1434860	just can clone itself with it. You keep feeding these animals
1434860	1438340	instead of them just getting infinitely big or long. They
1438500	1442020	start budding and reproducing and making a genetically
1442020	1446900	identical copy, right? I think it's critical for you. And then
1446900	1451060	they can also reproduce sexually too. So the same
1451060	1456660	animal can their stem cells can then generate testes or ovaries
1457340	1463220	or an egg here and reproduce sexually. So either way. And
1463220	1469140	then right, so again, it has essentially not exactly the same
1469140	1473940	but 20,000 genes very similar to our genome, right? So the genes
1473940	1478380	here are are essentially the same thing as your eye and yet
1478380	1481860	it's building something completely different. And then
1481860	1484540	it's small so it can be anywhere from 500 or one, one and a
1484540	1486540	half centimeters. And I'm currently sort of figuring out
1486540	1491100	what's the smallest one we can get to to make so that we can fit
1491100	1494700	that really under the field of view. Transparent, robust, you
1494700	1497220	can do all kinds of things to this thing. And then
1497260	1499300	interestingly also is that it completely regenerates its
1499300	1502620	nervous system every 20 days. So it's constantly making this
1502620	1509260	nervous system and maintaining itself somehow. Right. A lot
1509260	1511420	of molecular tools being developed. And then it has
1511420	1514660	these well-defined behaviors. So these are just so it's
1514660	1518020	resting, right? Just laying there doing nothing. And then
1518020	1520700	can just do a very simple longitudinal contraction where
1520700	1523340	it goes from long to short. And then the opposite of that is
1523340	1527060	elongation. So it goes from short to long. And then it has
1527060	1529660	complex behaviors. I mean, these are arbitrary words I'm
1529660	1532420	defining. I'm just saying these are more complex. And this one
1532420	1536060	is eating. So in lab, you feed hydra, artemianopoly, just
1536060	1539380	brine shrimp. And this is just glutathione, reduced glutathione
1539380	1542180	will also have them do this feeding response. So they'll
1542180	1545460	rip open. So they'll use their tentacles to capture shrimp,
1545900	1548980	rip open, rip open in their mouth and shove a bunch of them
1548980	1553340	inside of their body. And then the most complex, I would say is
1553340	1556500	somersalting. So it will reach out, stick its head and
1556500	1560180	tentacles down, contract, release its foot, flip over, and
1560180	1562260	then put its foot back down. So in this way, it can sort of
1562300	1565660	in quotes, walk. So it can do all of this with a very, very
1565660	1569460	simple nervous system. And so this is just some quick, yep.
1569580	1573020	Sorry, sorry, could I just ask on the on the behavior side? Does
1573020	1579140	anybody do? Has anybody checked various learning training? Can
1579140	1580540	you teach these things anything?
1580780	1585580	Right. So this is this is the new frontier. But there it's also
1585580	1590020	the new old frontier. So as is all science, that that there were
1590060	1593540	some old studies, I think some of the first was 1900 and then
1593540	1601060	1950 of habituation in Hydra. So if you just sort of if you
1601060	1603740	pinch them, or even stick an electrode in them, they'll
1603740	1607740	contract. And if if you keep doing that over and over again,
1607740	1611060	with it with the proper inter stimulus interval, they'll
1611060	1616060	stop, they'll habituate. But that hasn't there hasn't been like,
1616580	1621460	in the last, I don't know, 50 years, any of that has not been
1621460	1626260	repeated. And and I don't think it's because people have tried
1626260	1629220	and failed. I think most people haven't really revisited that.
1630580	1638300	But yeah, that's, that's on the docket. Yeah, and, and I mean,
1638300	1641660	there's so I guess, was I think it was nematostellas showing
1641660	1644340	associative learning there. So other Nigerians now have been
1644340	1649220	shown to be doing, you know, more complex things than meet the
1649220	1656340	eye. Right. So you get this hypostome. This is just a cartoon
1656340	1660020	of the same thing, this nerve net, the tentacles. This is where
1660020	1662700	they would have the buds coming off. This is the basal disc. And
1662700	1666340	this is the tissue. So it's a just two layers. It's not a true
1666340	1669020	three layer thing. There's no true mesoderm. There's just the
1669020	1672060	endoderm on the inside and the extra term on the outside. And
1672100	1676220	it's thought that all of these, these are also myo epithelial
1676220	1679780	cells, they're epithelial cells with, let's just go over there
1679780	1683100	like muscle processes at the bottom. So they're sort of a
1683100	1685740	dual cell type. And then it's thought that all of those are
1685740	1689620	connected by gap junctions. And then you have your nerve net in
1689620	1692940	the endoderm with sensory neurons poking into the inside of
1692940	1696020	the gut, and then ganglion neurons in the ectoderm with
1696020	1698860	sensory neurons poking out to the outside environment. And it's
1698860	1701500	thought that these do not communicate. But I think that
1701500	1705780	might not be accurate. But that's the current idea. And then
1706180	1708420	these three different cell types, you have eye cells, which are
1708420	1711300	the stem cells that make the germ cells, the gland cells,
1711300	1716060	nomadicides, which are specific to, to Nigeria are super cool cell
1716060	1720380	type that shoot out darts, like with toxins, essentially, and
1720380	1725940	then neurons. And then these all cell-free new. So the eye cells
1725940	1728140	make these four and the ectoderm and endoderm cell-free
1728140	1732180	new themselves also. So that's sort of just the gist of that.
1732180	1734860	And then this is the current view of sort of the connectome, if
1734860	1739300	you will, of Hydra. So this is from Charlie David at LMU using
1739300	1743020	anti-kid heron antibody that they've just shown sort of stains
1743020	1746020	all of the neurons in the animal. And it looks, you know,
1746020	1749060	like, again, this could just diffuse nerve net. And in the
1749060	1753820	ectoderm, it's sort of this north-south highway where you
1753820	1758100	have more of a bipolar neuron. And in the endoderm, it's a
1758140	1760620	more multipolar thing that's sort of going more radially
1760620	1763820	around the animal. And then again, this is from Rob Steele at
1763820	1768660	Irvine, where this is just GFP expressed in eye cells. And you
1768660	1771420	can see that there appears to be a little bit of a condensation
1771420	1774580	of neurons in the, in the foot and in the head. And again, I
1774580	1777580	think this is another thing to keep in mind that what we're
1777580	1780580	seeing is depending on the tool that we're using to look at this
1780580	1785020	thing. So which is true. Yes, they're both true. But when you
1785020	1788340	look at that, it's unclear, like how that there's no obvious
1788340	1792260	circuitry, there's no anything that you say that would really
1792260	1794980	tell you just looking at that structure, how that's going to
1794980	1797780	function. Is it functioning as one thing as many things who
1797780	1803060	knows, until Christoph put in G camp six. So this is a molecule
1803060	1807420	that will fluoresce every time the neuron fires. And you, he
1807420	1810140	made a transgenic animal expressing this in the eye
1810140	1814180	cells. So all of the neurons had G camp six expressed, he then
1814220	1817420	put the hydra in between two cover slips. So this is just a
1817420	1820620	hundred micron spacer, it's swimming around in hydra media,
1820620	1822940	so it can still behave in two dimensions. And then just put
1822940	1826940	this on a normal white field microscope, and came up with a
1826940	1830860	movie that looks like this. So it's sort of, you know, this
1831100	1833500	can you see all the pixels in the movie at the same time. And
1833500	1837380	when you do, what do you see? Are they all firing completely
1837380	1841140	independently, total chaos? No, and are they all firing as one
1841140	1844020	thing? No, it's, it's something else. And in order to figure
1844020	1847260	out what the something else was, Christoph had to painstakingly
1847460	1851660	circle every one of those neurons and track it over time to
1851660	1855940	analyze that data and figure out what, what is happening here
1855940	1859020	and came up with this sort of general model, and saying that
1859020	1861860	out of that seemingly simple nerve net, you have these three
1861860	1865340	independent sort of units, ensembles or circuits, however
1865340	1868220	you want to call that groups of neurons that are co firing
1868220	1873180	together. And the one that's most consistently associated with
1873220	1876940	muscle activity is CB, where every time it fires, you get a
1876940	1879500	longitudinal contraction. So it gets shorter. That's very, very
1879500	1882700	clear that that's motor. These other two are less clear rhythm
1882700	1885220	potential one and rhythm potential two. But the potential
1885220	1888900	two in that early paper was most associated with radial
1888900	1891700	contraction. So that's in the end of the animal, when that
1891700	1894780	fires, it gets skinnier and can do some ingestion. So it will
1894780	1898060	spit its food out or water, let's say from its mouth. And then
1898060	1902780	rhythm potential one is in the ectoderm. And when it fires in
1902780	1907940	that paper was correlated with elongation toward light. But
1907940	1910340	what was most interesting to me was that this was also
1910340	1912940	happening when the when the animals just sitting there
1912940	1917340	doing nothing, just there. And that again, is not new. We're
1917340	1921820	noticing a thing. Reading literature is helpful. So that
1922420	1924940	this was found in the 60s by Pisano and McCullough, where
1924940	1927140	they were just sticking an electrode into Hydra. And they
1927140	1931860	found the same thing that there was this rhythmic, you know,
1931860	1935340	firing of some kind of neural network in the animal, they
1935340	1937900	didn't have access to, they just knew that this was happening
1938060	1940700	with their electrode when the animals doing nothing. And they
1940700	1943300	were called this cryptic activity, they said, What the
1943300	1946260	hell is this doing? Right? Because again, at the time, the
1946260	1948780	idea is that the nervous system is there to generate
1948780	1953500	behavior. Otherwise, it's off. Why at the base of the Tree of
1953500	1956100	Life, the simplest nervous system, are we seeing all kinds of
1956100	1959660	activity going on? If it's not generating behavior? And so
1959700	1962660	he hypothesized in one of his early papers, that is this
1962660	1966260	thing, coordinating the nervous system, sort of the
1966260	1968580	quarterback of the thing, the conductor, whatever metaphor you
1968580	1972420	want to use. And I've been told that he went off and started
1972420	1976020	selling bikes. And so never finished that work. And so we
1976020	1979740	don't know. But it was discovered there, right with
1979740	1982100	an electrode, and it was discovered rediscovered, let's
1982100	1985340	say with calcium. So it's method independent that you find the
1985340	1989060	same sort of thing. And that is what got me interested and
1989060	1991620	brings us to this very brief history of what we know about
1991620	1994580	simultaneous neural activity, which is very little. Because as
1994580	1997460	I was saying, Sherrington at that time, the big mantra was
1997460	2001220	reflexive brain, it's doing nothing. Otherwise, but his
2001220	2004780	own student actually was finding something very different
2004780	2008260	than that. And he sort of, he cut the head off of a cat and
2008500	2012820	deafferented the cat, no sensory input whatsoever, zero input to
2012820	2017020	a nervous system, he had all kinds of activity going on to
2017060	2019860	the point where the cat could still walk. So this was clearly
2019860	2022420	internally generated neural activity had nothing to do with
2022420	2025420	outside input. But that was just ignored. I was like, whatever,
2025420	2030500	that guy's nuts. Whatever he's up to, let him do that. And then
2030540	2032700	at the same time, or around the same time, Hans Berger was
2032700	2037500	inventing the EEG, EEG, we have humans. I'm just sitting in a
2037500	2040700	chair, all kinds of electrical activity going on there as well.
2040980	2044020	And like I was saying, so it wasn't just Poisson and McCulloch
2044020	2046100	discovering this spontaneous activity in hydra, it was sort
2046140	2048860	of anybody looking at any Nigeria, we're sort of discovering
2048860	2052140	this kind of thing going on. But of course, no one's talking to
2052140	2055060	each other. And so no one knows. And so it wasn't, of course,
2055060	2059940	until the 2000s when Raeckel and others at WashU put humans into
2059940	2065740	fMRI scanners. And at the time, right, it's sort of what was
2065740	2069300	interesting is the task evoked activity. Anything else that you
2069300	2071740	couldn't explain was seen as noise, like white noise on the
2071740	2074700	TV, get rid of it. What we're interested in is what happens to
2074700	2078980	the brain when you go to do the task. But at some point, he was
2078980	2082820	like, Hey, all of those areas in the brain that are active at
2082820	2086660	rest seem to be specific. And they're specifically inhibited
2086660	2090020	when the person is going to do the task. So he called up this
2090020	2094180	default mode network, which became like, you know, a very hot
2094220	2097940	topic, and has reignited interest in study of spontaneous
2097940	2102460	neural activity, which we now know is one of the most highly
2102500	2105660	conserved aspects of all brains. And so this is from
2105660	2109220	Busacchi's review, and that spans a wide range of frequencies
2109220	2113660	to 600 Hertz, very ultra pass all the way down to ultra slow of
2113660	2116740	like the point one to point one Hertz. And this is something
2116740	2121380	that's found in all mammalian brains, regardless of size or
2121380	2126060	structure, you find this, right? And I think the current idea is
2126060	2128860	that that's just noise, right? That's reverb, you have a
2128860	2132100	complex enough electrical system, you're going to get
2132100	2134780	oscillations, it's not functional, it's not relevant,
2134780	2138340	it's an epiphenomenon of the system. It's not doing anything.
2139740	2143980	And I think one of the reasons that that still is the idea is
2143980	2148220	because you can't really image it or manipulate them in a
2148220	2151660	specific way to determine if you if you manipulate this
2151700	2155860	oscillation, in particular, does that do anything? Or what
2155860	2160540	does it do? But again, it's taking 20% total body energy and
2160540	2162980	one of the most highly conserved aspects of all brains that we've
2162980	2167180	looked at. So the question is why or what is it doing? And
2167180	2169980	again, one of the most highly studied is the default mode
2169980	2174700	network in humans. And this is related to the self in theory.
2174700	2177180	So it's most active at rest, it's going on all the time and its
2177180	2180340	function continues to be debated. But it's thought to be
2180340	2183140	involved when you're internally focused. So you're either
2183220	2186900	remembering your past, thinking about yourself right now or
2186900	2190380	contemplating your future. And the same sort of midline
2190380	2193540	structures that I'll show you in a second appear to be
2193540	2199300	activated when you're doing self related processing. So if I'm
2199300	2202300	shown a picture of a stranger versus myself, the default mode
2202300	2204460	network lights up when I'm looking at something related to
2204460	2207500	the self. And that's in any modality, whether that's pictures,
2207500	2212900	whether that's hearing my voice, those kinds of things. So and
2212900	2215220	then also it's linked to a number of neuropsychiatric
2215220	2217980	disorders. And so you can't throw like a dart at PubMed right
2217980	2221420	now and not see the default mode network link to something. And
2221420	2225420	the way I'm simplifying that is to say that the general idea
2225420	2229900	seems to be that you have states like depression and anxiety
2229900	2232100	when you're too internally focused, the default mode network
2232100	2234620	is too active. This is associated with rumination and
2234620	2239420	worry and depression and anxiety and vice versa. When in
2239420	2242020	states like psychosis, psychedelic meditation, when
2242060	2245020	you disrupt the default mode network, this leads to in quotes
2245020	2249860	ego dissolution. So some of the best data that there are in human
2249860	2253260	studies are when you put humans in and that they can self
2253260	2257900	report, you know, on either psilocybin, LSD or DMT, that
2257900	2260620	whatever they think they are sort of dissolved, and then you
2260620	2264220	can see what happened in the MRI scanner. And that correlates
2264220	2268260	with disruption of the default mode network. So the question is
2268260	2271300	how how why or how would that have anything to do with the
2271300	2273180	self? What would be the mechanism by which the
2273180	2275100	development network could implement something like a
2275100	2279620	self? And there's sort of, you know, the structural argument
2279620	2282100	and the functional argument, the structural argument being that
2282100	2284980	it's a central midline structure. So medial prefrontal
2284980	2289060	cortex, the posterior cingulate, the medial temporal lobes, that
2289060	2292740	these are sort of these major rich hubs in the brain that are
2292740	2296460	connecting regions that would otherwise be segregated, right?
2296460	2299340	So you can imagine if you had a brain where the visual cortex
2299340	2301500	was not talking to the auditory cortex is not talking to the
2301500	2303540	olfactory cortex, and it was not talking to the internal
2303540	2308700	brainstem system, that you know, that would be a disintegrated
2308700	2312220	system. So is this this sort of central midline superhighway
2312220	2315700	with these thickly malignated axons connecting all of those
2315700	2318740	brain areas sort of getting input from all of them and then
2318860	2323740	maybe getting sending information back. So that's sort of
2323740	2327420	the structural thing. And then the functional piece is that
2327420	2329300	it's one of the lowest frequency oscillators in the brain of
2329300	2334300	0.01 to 0.1 Hertz. And this is where we got to go real crazy.
2334500	2336740	And this is now finally going to answer your question about the
2336740	2343860	observers in the brain, which is so Buzaki was saying, right,
2343860	2348820	like, this is what we've been doing as a neuroscientist is
2348820	2352540	looking at things from a quote unquote, third party, third
2352540	2355060	party objective view, you're looking at a brain with a bunch
2355060	2357740	of squiggly activity, and then you're looking at its output,
2357740	2360780	this behavior, and you're correlating those two things. And
2360780	2363900	you can say, Okay, if I see this squiggly activity, then I
2363900	2366860	can predict that the animal, whatever organism is going to
2366860	2370060	do this behavior. And that's helpful for us. And that's very
2370060	2373980	useful clinically, right, we could use that. But that's not
2373980	2377700	understanding. That's not what the brain is doing. The brain has
2377700	2380580	to observe itself, the neurons have to observe their own
2380580	2386220	information, and then decide sort of in quotes, decide what what
2386220	2392860	to do. So, right, so if you think of neuron A, B, and C
2392860	2396380	here, neuron A has to sort of observe the upstream activity
2396780	2400780	from its inputs neurons one, five, and nine. And in order to do
2400780	2402980	that, it has to be integrating that information over a certain
2402980	2406860	period of time. And let's just say that's 100 milliseconds. So
2406900	2412420	it reads that information and decides and not decides whatever
2412420	2417060	word you want to use, will fire or not, right? Based on that
2417100	2420260	that upstream input and same thing with B and C. So you can
2420260	2422860	think of those as sort of the highest frequency oscillators in
2422860	2427300	the system, the letters, if you want, in the neural code. Then
2427340	2431220	the downstream observer of A, B, and C is Q, let's say it has to
2431220	2434420	read out the input from A, B, and C, and therefore has to be
2434420	2437660	integrating that input over a longer period of time to give
2437660	2441060	time to for A, B, and C to give it its input. So that would then
2441060	2444380	say integrate over 200 milliseconds. So it then reads
2444380	2448260	out A, B, and C. And so reading out, let's say, cab a neural
2448260	2452820	word. So looking over here, that would be like this frequency.
2453060	2455500	And so you could say you would go from letters to neural words,
2455620	2457740	and then this is going to read over a longer time scale to get
2457740	2461100	inputs from those to form sentences, and then paragraphs
2461100	2463660	and all the way down. And so is it possible that you have this
2463660	2467060	thing that's the lowest frequency oscillator, getting all of
2467060	2470180	the input on the longest time scale in the entire nervous
2470180	2474900	system to read all of that information out? And so this is
2474900	2479180	just sort of a picture of what that might look like, placed on
2479180	2481420	top of the brain. And I like to think of this in terms of the
2481420	2485220	visual cortex is sort of the easiest for me to conceptualize.
2485780	2490020	And if we think of this little red thing here as the highest
2490020	2492940	frequency oscillator, sort of the letter of the neural code, if
2492940	2495140	that's coding in the visual cortex, at least for the
2495140	2500100	simplest thing like edges in the visual field, then the next
2500100	2504060	layer, layer two is getting input from that layer. And that
2504060	2506860	has to be reading that over a longer period of time. So it
2506860	2509700	has enough time to get input from, let's say two edges for it
2509700	2512460	to read out a higher level abstract concept or shape that
2512460	2517780	looks like this. And then the next lowest layer, lower
2517780	2521180	frequency reading out the input from layer two, right over a
2521180	2523540	longer time scale, so that it has time to read out this shape
2523540	2526260	and this shape to form a higher level abstract concept of this
2526260	2529740	shape, all the way down, right, to the lowest frequency
2529740	2532940	oscillator, the, let's say in this case, the default network
2532940	2535180	that's reading out all of the visual information, the auditory
2535180	2538020	information, the somatosensory information, the factory and
2538020	2542220	internal state of the organism. And in that way, getting all of
2542220	2545540	the highest level view, the highest abstract view of both
2545540	2547780	the external environment, the world in the internal
2547780	2554140	environment of the organism or the self. Right. So that's sort
2554620	2558340	of, okay, can it, can it be the reader, sort of the integrator
2558340	2561580	of the information, but then can it also be the coordinator top
2561580	2565860	down? And in this way, we sort of went through that diagram, but
2565860	2569380	in this case, if we're thinking, is it possible that these low
2569380	2574780	frequency oscillators can essentially organize higher
2574780	2577380	frequency oscillators through various mechanisms of cross
2577380	2580180	frequency coupling of like phase phase coupling, phase
2580180	2583140	amplitude coupling and these kinds of things. So is it possible
2583140	2585340	that this lowest frequency oscillator is essentially sort
2585340	2587620	of critical for setting up this hierarchy of oscillators and
2587620	2591460	organizing them in sort of space and time in the brain, such
2591460	2595580	that if you get rid of it, that organization, that hierarchy
2595700	2599980	might disappear. And there's some evidence, right, that when you
2599980	2603900	give humans psychedelics, the brain goes into a more disordered
2603900	2608140	or chaotic state. And it's unclear totally. If, if you get
2608140	2610540	rid of this default mode network, do you get something like
2610540	2612420	this, where you have all these other oscillators that are all
2612420	2615460	like this or do the oscillators themselves go completely out of
2615460	2618980	order and you just get complete chaos, right? And it seems to
2618980	2621860	me that it's not the latter of that complete chaos, because it
2621860	2624060	seems like, you know, if people report psychedelic
2624060	2626500	experiences, it's like, they're still having some kind of
2626500	2629580	experience, it's just less order that you might be having those
2629580	2632580	ensembles playing in a different order than you normally would.
2634060	2637460	So all this is complete speculation, right? And so it's
2637460	2639660	because it's very difficult, like I said, to image or
2639660	2642660	manipulate human brain. So luckily, this thing appears to be
2642660	2647180	highly conserved. So you have humans, monkeys, rats, a hierarchy
2647180	2649820	of brain white oscillations have been found a bunch of insects
2649820	2653380	also. And then this gets into some, you know, really out there
2653380	2656640	stuff where we're talking about finding these things in even in
2656640	2659220	systems that don't have a nervous system. So people have
2659220	2661580	been looking at this kind of thing in plants for a long
2661580	2664300	time, when you just put a microelectrode array in their
2664300	2670740	root, and you see these kinds of, let's say electrical spikes in
2670740	2674540	plants that Belusca and others have been saying for a long time
2674540	2676140	might be involved in information integration and
2676140	2681280	communication plant wide. And then Adamatsky putting this, these
2681280	2684860	electrodes into oyster mushrooms, and just finding the same
2684860	2692060	thing, like, yeah, these, these global organism wide electrical
2692060	2696860	spikes. Yeah, and this animal that he's doing all kinds of
2696860	2699420	interesting things to about is this is this is a fungal
2699420	2703300	language. And that kind of thing. And then same thing with
2703300	2708180	amoeba, finding these low frequency, I guess, electrical
2708180	2711580	like oscillations or spikes, it's unclear what they're made of,
2711620	2714780	right, in that case, and then bacteria here in single cells
2714780	2718700	when I'm going first made the voltage indicators of putting
2718700	2721280	those into single cells, and seeing that even bacteria are
2721280	2725280	having these low frequency electrical oscillations, that
2725280	2728560	then if you play that movie too, and you didn't, and I didn't
2728560	2730840	tell you that those are bacteria, you might think that those
2730840	2737240	aren't like a dish of neurons, you know, flashing. And then,
2737440	2741680	once you put them together, as you know, into a biofilm, right,
2741680	2745120	so those individual bacteria, you put them together, they, they
2745120	2750720	generate these global sort of biofilm wide potassium waves
2750720	2754760	that help them coordinate themselves as one giant unit,
2754800	2756800	and then not only can they do that with themselves, but they
2756800	2761160	can do this, you know, long range. So biofilm one wants to
2761160	2765280	eat, and biofilm two wants to eat. If there's enough nutrients,
2765480	2769440	they eat at the same time. But if there's not, they can
2769440	2773280	coordinate nutrient sharing, and then they sort of oscillate in
2773280	2777360	anti phase. So the general idea then just being that are these
2777360	2781760	low frequency electrical oscillations, right, ways to
2781760	2786000	coordinate otherwise autonomous units into coherent holes, no
2786000	2790160	matter where you are with or without a nervous system. Right,
2790160	2793120	so this, this gets a little bit, you got to take a lot of drugs
2793120	2797160	to watch this, but this is, this is what I just showed you,
2797160	2800000	right, we're all very used to this, the neural tissue being
2800000	2804560	electrical, you get ions flowing through. And, and that's how
2804560	2806600	you, you know, you generate action potentials, we're all
2806600	2812320	used to that. But this is where people get confused, okay, hung
2812320	2816360	up, where you're leading the chart, this is, this is what
2816360	2819480	yeah, like when I when I learned of your stuff, I was like, no
2819480	2823800	way. So yeah, it's like, of course, this is how this works.
2824080	2827320	Um, it's just a different, it's just slower, right, people for
2827320	2829680	really hard time. And I think this is going to be out there,
2829680	2832680	but like, I'm excited to think of like, different scales of
2832680	2835360	like, planetary or really small, we can't deal with. And it's
2835360	2837560	like, even in the biological sphere, we can't deal with like
2837560	2842520	different spatial stuff. But yeah, this is just, it's just
2842520	2845400	slower. So you can have ions flowing through gap junctions
2845400	2850760	and non neural tissue. And this, you know, I'd be very curious
2850760	2855120	to know what you think or what you're finding in terms of any
2855120	2862440	of these, let's say, non neural bioelectric networks. If, if
2862440	2865160	you're finding anything of the sort, if there are, there are
2865160	2868960	any kind of like, you know, higher frequency oscillations or
2868960	2871640	lower frequency oscillations, and if there's any of that, that
2871640	2876400	that's sort of organizing even the non neural tissue, we can get
2876400	2878920	there in a second. But that would be the idea is it's a very
2878920	2883640	similar thing as I was just saying up here that, yeah, you
2883640	2887080	have individual cells that would be, you know, that the voltage
2887080	2890280	there, if there's some kind of fluctuation would be also
2890440	2893960	some higher frequency. And those can be sort of put into
2893960	2897720	groups of a lower frequency to form, let's say, a subunit, like
2897720	2900840	an arm, and then you can have a bunch of those arms being read
2900840	2910440	out, right? Yeah, okay. What time is it? Okay, yeah, yeah. And,
2910440	2915000	and, and on up to sort of, to sort of like build chunks of
2915000	2920760	bodies based on on a similar, let's say principle of these
2920760	2926360	voltage circuits, being read out by lower and lower frequency
2926360	2930760	oscillators. And then in single cells, is this possible that
2930760	2933720	instead of proteins being sort of just the structural units of
2933720	2937000	cells, which is what I've been taught my whole life, is it
2937000	2940040	possible that these things are actually themselves conducting
2940760	2944600	electricity, which is what I'm forgetting his name now, Stuart
2944600	2948600	Lindsay at Arizona has shown that you get like nano semen
2948600	2951720	currents flowing through all proteins, no matter he just
2951720	2955320	picked six at random, like BSA, collagen, some things that you
2955320	2957560	just wouldn't be like, oh, that's conducting electricity, why
2957560	2963320	would it be? So is it the case that cells are actually true
2963320	2967560	little living computer chips, where the proteins are forming
2968280	2971560	electrical circuits on and off, and that metabolism itself
2971560	2974280	we've been taught is sort of generating ATP and energy, but
2974280	2976920	it's also generating a bunch of hydrogen ions. And so is it
2976920	2980520	also just giving us a pool of hydrogen ions to be flowing
2980520	2983160	through the computer chip. So that's, that's out there, but
2983160	2987000	that's, that's what I was thinking on that one. Okay, so
2987000	2988680	right, so you can build all these things in these different
2988680	2991160	ways at these different scales. And, and so what might they be
2991160	2993720	doing again, could they be sort of maintaining systems out on
2993800	2998680	your criticality, right? If in the human brain, for example,
2998680	3001000	with the default mode network around is thought to be at
3001000	3006600	criticality, where I can sort of help the system form patterns
3006600	3013080	at a useful time scale. But you imagine, you can also then
3013080	3015960	have a system that's totally on or totally off, you either
3015960	3019960	have brain death, or totally on speed is a tonic chronic
3020040	3024440	seizure, or totally disordered, in terms of total total chaos.
3024440	3027320	And this appears to be what happens, you go towards chaos,
3027320	3029640	if you get rid of this organizer and at least the human
3029640	3032120	brain. So I don't know what happens in any of these other
3032120	3035240	systems, if you get rid of that. So again, integrating all the
3035240	3038040	bottom of electrical information in the system, and then
3038040	3043240	coordinating at top down. And so very quickly on that, not
3043240	3048200	only with this thing sort of maybe maintained the overall
3048280	3051880	electrical sort of organization or structure of the system,
3051880	3060120	but then it's the spikes of that oscillator are not totally
3060120	3062680	constant, like a mechanical clock that you get, you know,
3062680	3066760	every 60 seconds, it's variable. And I think that would be
3066760	3070040	variable in terms of like, external and internal input,
3070040	3073160	so that it can sort of coordinate the entire system top
3073160	3076040	down and provide some kind of information about the overall
3076120	3079560	state of the system by how frequently it's firing. And so
3079560	3082440	that's complete speculation there. Low frequency, you're
3082440	3085800	sort of saying, okay, within a range of frequencies, everyone
3085800	3088680	that's local gets some kind of global piece of information
3088680	3093000	that's giving everyone that that knowledge that this is this
3093000	3095720	frequency means everything is cool, keep doing your local
3095720	3099160	job, however you do it. And a higher frequency signal means
3099160	3103720	something else to the local function. And there maybe need
3103720	3108760	to speed up their processes. Right. So, so again, is this is
3108760	3112200	this thing conserved in Hydra? And so that's sort of what I
3112200	3114520	want to do is just start testing this thing there. And to
3114520	3117080	just speed this up is to just say, does the does the Hydra
3117080	3119480	cell phone serve as the organizer? Sorry, organisms
3119480	3122600	unifier, an ultimate integrator of both its internal and
3122600	3124920	external input to generate coherent behavior, i.e. a
3124920	3128360	unified self, and I'll just breeze through. So again, just
3128360	3131160	to quickly say that first of all how to do all this manual
3131240	3134600	tracking by hand. And so what I've been spending my time
3134600	3137960	doing is trying to get all this automatic working with a
3137960	3141320	group of people in Rafa's lab to sort of make a I don't know
3141320	3145640	if people can see this or what, but the dual color animals so
3145640	3148040	that you can use that nucleus that never disappears while
3148040	3150280	the animals moving because keep in mind in all other neural
3150280	3152360	systems, you're putting a microscope on the head of the
3152360	3158120	thing. And it's not moving much, but this entire system is
3158120	3159640	moving. So you have to figure out a way to track it and
3159640	3162440	extract all of those calcium signals from each neuron and
3162440	3166440	end up down here with individual spikes from each of
3166440	3169240	those neurons. And what's another interesting or I think
3169240	3172440	potentially unique thing about Hydra is from Christos
3172440	3175240	initial work when he put an electrode in, at least in one
3175240	3177720	of the particular neurons in Hydra does appear that one
3177720	3180600	calcium spike equates to about one active potential. So just
3180600	3184120	using optical information from this animal, you can
3184120	3187960	essentially capture every spike from every neuron and get a
3187960	3191080	real clear picture because in other systems, a calcium is
3191080	3195400	equate to many, many active potentials in the mouse, for
3195400	3200840	example. So it's hard to have that as you only read out.
3200840	3204440	Okay, right. So I'll just show you really quickly this beautiful
3204440	3210520	movie. This is right. So those are the all of the the TD
3210520	3213720	Tomato and then the G Camp seven neurons there. So then you
3213800	3219560	can track all of that and do the signal analysis. And then you
3219560	3224040	can write then you can also do these automatic behavior
3224040	3227160	tracking using deep block cut so that you can do automated
3227160	3229560	behavior and automated neural signal and start making sense
3229560	3233080	of this stuff. And so with that, I'll just I'll just end with a
3233080	3235400	few like teasers, right? So like this is just to show you
3235400	3239560	prove that Hydra's lays there and rests and it still has this
3239560	3241560	neural activity which will flash in a second right there. So
3241640	3244360	you can start asking. So what is the relationship between
3244360	3246920	that network and its other two networks? Is that network
3246920	3249880	actually predictive of global neural activity in this animal
3249880	3252600	and all of those kinds of studies? What's really I think
3252600	3255160	unique about Hydra is this, right? These two other things
3255160	3258760	that you can do where this is the parent animal, this is the
3258760	3260840	foot in the head and this is a bud. This is an early bud
3260840	3262920	coming off and you can start to say, okay, this is again,
3262920	3265480	this is genetically identical animal. This is one slab of
3265480	3268120	tissue. But at some point, the genetically identical thing
3268120	3271240	becomes two individuals, right? And how does that happen? You
3271240	3275960	can like so, right? At this point at this stage, their
3275960	3279400	global neural activity is essentially looking the same
3279400	3281960	and their behavior is essentially the same. But at some
3281960	3285560	point, that tissue becomes three different individuals. So
3285560	3289080	this is a bud here, a bud here and the parent here, and
3289080	3292360	they're flashing so asynchronously, right? Like
3292360	3294440	different Christmas trees and they start to develop
3294440	3296920	completely independent behavior. So you can sort of, you
3296920	3299720	know, go to town on all of those kinds of questions. And
3299720	3302520	then you can also do all kinds of other crazy shit, which is
3302520	3304760	cut, make these two animals with two heads and you would
3304760	3306920	expect sort of like a split brain patient. You're sharing one
3306920	3311080	body, you have two heads, one foot. In this case, these, I
3311080	3314200	would have predicted they're gonna, you know, act
3314200	3316840	independently. But it's also the case that it looks like
3316840	3320680	Hydra's brain like the plant might be in its foot. So these
3320680	3325160	actually start acting basically the same. But you can, and I
3325160	3326680	didn't know if this would be possible, you can actually
3326680	3331800	break a Hydra. So if you make a split foot, then it starts
3331800	3335880	acting. So this was contracting independently of this foot.
3335880	3338840	And then all of its sort of nervousness was sort of broken
3338840	3341800	that it's not, it is no longer one coherent thing. So even
3341800	3345480	the tentacles, it's sort of the body here is, is, is, let's
3345480	3348520	say, flashing independently of this foot independently of
3348520	3352120	that one. And so it's sort of having a hard time trying to
3352120	3358840	coordinate itself as one coherent thing. Right. Right. So
3358840	3362200	yeah, so just to conclude that these things, you know, low
3362200	3364200	frequency electrical oscillations are found through the
3364200	3366520	living world. We don't really know what they're doing. This
3366520	3369640	crazy hypothesis is that are they, you know, overall
3369640	3372120	electrical organism organizers that can do these three
3372120	3374920	jobs, maintaining systems out of near criticality that if you
3374920	3379480	get rid of them, you go more towards chaos disorder. And
3379480	3383480	then are they integrating the little information and then
3383480	3387000	from that top level view, coordinating everything from
3387000	3389480	the top down. And then I'm going to start trying to test
3389480	3392840	these things out. These tools have been built. So there's the
3392840	3395880	the world one tour. And I'd like to thank all those people
3395880	3399480	that have contributed all this. And you for sitting here.
3399480	3403720	Yeah. That was awesome. Thank you so much. Yes. Super
3403720	3405480	interesting. We're going to have to, we're going to have to
3405480	3409400	schedule a part two because there's a bunch of things I
3409400	3412520	want to I want to ask you and and and also talk about this
3412520	3416120	the cell phone concept, both in cells and embryos and then
3416120	3420360	outside of electrophysiology in general, because we're
3420360	3422520	starting to see something similar in other systems that
3422520	3425560	are not natively electrophysiological at all. Yeah.
3425560	3428360	So so I think this is this is a more, you know, what you've
3428360	3432280	got here is a very kind of profound generic concept that
3432280	3435560	I think could apply to a lot of things. Yeah, awesome. Love
3435640	3441160	it. Yeah. All right. Thank you so much. Yeah. Great. Yeah.
3441160	3446280	We'll talk soon. All right. See you. Okay. Thanks.
