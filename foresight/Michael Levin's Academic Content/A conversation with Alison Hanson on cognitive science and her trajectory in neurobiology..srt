1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Yeah, thanks so much for joining me. How are you doing?

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,680
Awesome. And thank you very, very much for having me. I'm

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,280
excited. This is going to be fun.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,960
Yeah, yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. Yeah, I want I

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,160
want to shine the light on some of the younger people that are

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,200
doing some amazing stuff. And I'm really excited about your

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,760
work. So

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,040
thank you. Yeah, me too.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,320
Cool. Yeah, so maybe maybe just, you know, introduce yourself

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,800
where you are now. And we'll we'll go from there.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,880
Totally. So I am Ali Hansen and I'm in Raphael Usain Lab here at

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,120
Columbia. And how did I don't know that it's time yet to go into

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,480
a full background, but I'll just suffice it to say that I've

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,000
completed my psychiatry residency. But my background was in

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,600
sort of selling of developmental biology, and sort of jumped

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,720
into the field of neuroscience and using Hydra as a model

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,240
system to sort of study, let's say, to be able to see the whole

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,200
nervous system at once. And from there, what really interested

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,360
me is the role of spontaneous neural activity, neural activity

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,760
that's going on when the animal is not behaving. So I'm now a

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,960
postdoc finishing that and in the process of figuring out where

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,840
I'll go next to start my own group.

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,960
Yeah, yeah, why don't you maybe talk a little bit about your

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,840
background and just kind of your journey as far back as makes

25
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,240
sense of how you got here.

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I mean, I think, I think maybe far, far

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,800
back, I'll just broad overview of a person from Iowa thinking, I

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,680
don't know, no one else is probably paying attention to

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,920
basketball, but Caitlin Clark, it went to my high school and

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,360
she's the newest phenom. And so I thought, I wrote on my thing,

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,440
I was going to play basketball in the WNBA and then I never

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:51,000
grew, but ended up playing basketball in college, and studied

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,720
molecular biology, and ended up doing MD PhD program. And my

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,240
PhD at that point was in, yeah, so cell and developmental

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,560
biology and the molecular mechanisms of wind signaling, so

36
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,640
very, very molecular. And so I got sort of trained in that,

37
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,880
that belief system that molecules are king. And that sort of

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,240
explains, you know, not only how cells work, but how

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,600
development works. And so my thesis was on that sort of the

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,880
molecular mechanisms of wind signaling and ubiquit relation

41
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,280
and these kinds of things. But then luckily, someone clued me

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,800
in to the physiology course at the MBL in Woods Hole, which sort

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,280
of was like, Oh, there's a whole other way to do this, you can

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,760
sort of really zoom out and interact with other people, and

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,480
in many other different disciplines, right? So there I

46
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,480
was with peer mathematicians, physicists, computational

47
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,600
scientists and people who had no experience with biology and I

48
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,240
was the biologist coming in. And so it was like this awesome

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,440
thing, right? Where you go and you do two weeks with different

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,040
scientists on different projects and get really

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,000
exposed to totally different ways of thinking. And in that, I

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,280
ended up with Goudon's Danizer, actually, as one of my mentors,

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,840
and I did a two week course on modeling three proteins in the

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,640
wind pathway. And I was like, Oh, wow, like you can really start

55
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,080
learning something really counterintuitive, something that

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,240
you wouldn't know by just saying, Hey, you're going to draw

57
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,480
the cell signaling pathway in a two dimensional piece of paper

58
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,400
and draw a bunch of arrows and that's understanding. I was

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,000
like, Oh, shit, that doesn't actually explain anything, right?

60
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,520
So yeah, that that was sort of my first worry. And then of

61
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,480
course, the likes of like Mark Kirschner and Andrew Murray were

62
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,240
on the chalkboard doing all kinds of these things. And it was

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,760
like, Oh, there's a different way to do this to find the

64
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,920
simplest system possible, and try to model as much of it as you

65
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,880
can to gain some understanding. And of course, that was right

66
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,880
the end my PhD. So I didn't have time to sort of implement that

67
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,800
and then went back to do medical training. And then I took

68
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,760
another foray, which I think is important to how I ended up

69
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,640
doing this kind of resume right now, which is art. So I left

70
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,000
in the middle of my MD PhD training to go study painting in

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,320
Santa Fe, New Mexico, with an amazing person who is Tony

72
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,600
Rider, and that totally changed sort of, this is going to sound

73
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,480
nuts, but how I see and the way I think it sort of opened up my

74
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,840
mind to like, how you approach reality with a fixed idea. And

75
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,320
so I went in there and I'm like, Oh, I got to paint here was so

76
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,280
it was it was classical realism. So you're trying to be

77
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,440
portraiture and nude models drawing and painting. I didn't

78
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,720
have any experience with this really at all, except for you

79
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,920
know, childhood classes or something. And going in there

80
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,640
just for an example of like, Oh, a shadow is dark, just black,

81
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,040
or something is like, no, as long as you have this belief,

82
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,560
you'll never paint a shadow as it actually is because there's

83
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,360
no such thing as pure black in nature, or reality, right?

84
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,640
There's always some amount of light, some amount of color,

85
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,680
something. And I remember so Ted South Jacobs was Tony's

86
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,640
teacher is a very similar sort of lineage in art and science,

87
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,080
who wrote a whole book on the anatomy of human forms. Like if

88
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,080
you paint a human eyeball that looks like an almond with a

89
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,400
circle in it, you'll never ever paint an eyeball that is true to

90
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,720
reality. So it's kind of like, Oh, all of these concepts that

91
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,360
I'm laying on top of these things are not real. Like it can I

92
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,400
get rid of those things? That was part of that exercise for two

93
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,120
years of trying to like, unlearn all of the things I had been

94
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,920
told about what a human, you know, is and the features of it in

95
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,320
order to paint what it actually is. And at the same time, there

96
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,480
was a upaya Zen Center was in the back yard of this place. So I

97
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,080
learned Zen brain, which is about conscious complex adaptive

98
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,320
systems and all of this kind of stuff. Also Santa Fe

99
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,080
Institute was there. So I was just all over doing all this

100
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,520
stuff and taking all kinds of classes around all of that. And

101
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,720
ultimately sort of, you know, I was I was debating, do I go

102
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,440
paint full time? Do I do a postdoc? And if I was going to

103
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,120
just do a straight postdoc, I was going to do on the origin of

104
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,240
multicellularity, right? Like, how do you go from one cell to a

105
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,080
group of cells? That was what I was interested in. But then, you

106
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,320
know, I got interested in like, I really want to help people in

107
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,920
quotes. And I want to do that through sort of psychiatry. So

108
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,520
it's our way to put all of that stuff together. And I was like,

109
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,560
well, shit, now I'm going to have to switch fields and study

110
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,400
neuroscience. Which I was like, that's not at the time, I'm

111
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,680
sorry, any neuroscience is out there. But like, that's not

112
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,000
science. That's not molecular. What is that? It's, it's a you're

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,520
putting a human in fMRI skin, you're looking at blood flowing

114
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,320
all around. You're not even looking at neural activity. It

115
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,200
was like, this isn't understanding. This isn't

116
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,120
mechanism. Because for me, mechanism, what's the amino

117
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,520
acid on the protein? That that's a mechanism, right? That was the

118
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,320
kind of thinking. But going to that Zen brain conference

119
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,840
actually was was one of those things we're like, oh, some of

120
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,840
these questions, you just can't reduce to an amino acid and a

121
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,360
protein, like that that model that that way of thinking doesn't

122
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,640
doesn't compute here. So there was a lot of, you know, things

123
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,000
going all around. But then, yeah, deciding, okay, I'm going to

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,840
pursue a residency in psychiatry and try to figure out what is

125
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,800
neuroscience. And so like, you had to do all these interviews,

126
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,360
and I was just essentially using the residency interview as a

127
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,040
postdoc interview to say, who's doing neuroscience? Where? What

128
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,200
are they up to? And what level of scalar people studying all of

129
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,720
this? I was just trying to see the lay of the land. Yeah, and I

130
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,000
remember, I think, actually, at one point, somehow got a hold of

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,280
Sidney Brenner, when he was in the hospital in Singapore, and

132
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,560
I was like, Hey, what level scale do you think we should be

133
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,400
doing this? You know, studying the nervous system? And I'm

134
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,720
pretty sure I can't even remember his answer, but it was like

135
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,800
single cells, you could go down, you can go up and this kind of

136
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,720
thing. And so that kind of question of, of where, how do

137
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,560
you tackle this problem? And then I ended up reading Rafa's

138
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,520
articles, George Church and Scientific American around that

139
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,240
time of like, you know, using complex adaptive systems theory

140
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,200
to study the brain, you need to see the whole thing. I'm like,

141
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,320
Yes. So on that interview, I then talked to Rafa, and he had a

142
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,000
hydra on the screen, and it was just one of those moments where

143
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,840
I'm like, No way. This is amazing. This is this is exactly

144
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,400
what I've been looking for, like all of my dreams coming true on

145
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,040
the screen, like it's a simple system. You can see the whole

146
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,480
thing, you know, I don't know. And it's like, it has a lot of

147
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,920
it, you know, obviously, rich history and cell and developmental

148
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,160
biology, evolution, like it was all together. And one thing

149
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,520
I'm like, All right, that's what I'm gonna have to do. And,

150
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,120
yeah, in early saw that there was this spontaneous neural

151
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,920
activity in that animal. And I was like, What is this? Right?

152
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,560
What is that? And that got me very curious about where else that

153
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,640
was found, which leads to the human brain and all of these

154
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,800
things and, and the self and all of that. So it sort of all was

155
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,280
coming together. And then I was sort of, you know, seeing

156
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,120
patients as a resident. And then had a little bit of research

157
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,280
time. So I was like, really reading and thinking and looking

158
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,680
and, and all of that. Yeah, and I mean, I'll just disclose to

159
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,760
you that I'm a, I'm a Zen student. And so it was also a

160
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,160
scientist of my own mind. So I've been, you know, exploring it

161
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:10,080
from that angle. A lot. So first person point of view and third

162
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,160
person with patience. And then, you know, the in quotes, third

163
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,600
person objective view of the system too. So there's all of

164
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,720
that at play all the time. So yeah, that's the longest version

165
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,600
I can muster.

166
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,320
Yeah, yes, very interesting. The art at the art angle, I think

167
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,680
is also is also quite quite interesting. I do know, you know,

168
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,600
I can't draw anything like that. But I do a bunch of photography

169
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
and I agree with you that that watching the light and like

170
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,640
trying to trying to capture what you actually see or what you

171
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,600
think you see is an interesting component of it. Yeah. How do

172
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,600
you, how do you think about I'm curious, since you have you have

173
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,080
a background in molecular genetics and also now neuroscience?

174
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,120
How do you think about the kinds of things that those systems

175
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,160
are good at? Like how are how are molecular dynamics and the

176
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,800
kinds of things you get out of those different from what you

177
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,520
can get out of out of, you know, for example, electrophysiology,

178
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,800
you know, in terms of the computations, the usage, like

179
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,880
how are the how what's different about those systems?

180
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,000
You mean like sort of at the cellular level versus the system

181
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
level or like the neural?

182
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,040
I mean, I mean, if you were going to if you were going to

183
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,000
build things and your options were gene regulatory networks

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,400
and diffusion versus electrical networks and synaptic kinds of

185
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,400
things, what are the different, you know, dynamics that you can

186
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,520
expect to get out of those systems? How are they different

187
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,080
functionally?

188
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,760
Yes, great question. I mean, ultimately, this is what I sort

189
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,120
of, I mean, this isn't any big idea or anything. It's just like

190
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,120
one of them is slower, right? So like molecules diffusing limits

191
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,280
you I think in space and time. Whereas electricity, right,

192
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,320
allows speed and distance. So it just speeds up processes, right?

193
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,440
So I don't think there's anything particularly special

194
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,560
about neurons. I think you agree with that, right? They did. I

195
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,440
don't know. And if we're talking about, let's say memory or

196
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,720
computation, any of those things, those can be implemented in

197
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,640
any, any material, right? There's nothing special about

198
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,840
neurons, this can happen in those molecules, if you put them

199
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,800
together in certain ways, and you maintain a pattern, right,

200
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,080
that's relevant to the organism, that can be implemented in the

201
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:37,080
molecules. But it just sort of limits, I would say, yeah, the

202
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,760
space and time of that that molecules are on a shorter like

203
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:47,160
length scale, obviously, and take longer to move and

204
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,400
communicate, whereas you can send electricity much faster over

205
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:56,080
a longer distance. So yeah, I don't know if that's answering

206
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,240
what you're asking, but that's sort of how I think about it.

207
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree. That's that's definitely, that's

208
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,240
definitely an important, an important feature. You know,

209
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,320
people people sometimes ask me like, what's what's magical

210
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,280
about bio electricity, like what's different about

211
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,520
electrical networks, that's harder, or maybe even even not

212
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,200
doable in typical molecular, you know, the kinds of kinds of

213
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,320
networks. Yeah.

214
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,360
Right. And I mean, because I, what I mean, I'm just thinking of

215
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,840
this, like, intuitively, at some point of like, you know, what

216
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,840
do we as human beings use to communicate, we use electricity

217
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,440
because it's the fastest thing, use the smallest thing in

218
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,880
electron that can go the fastest, right? And that's how we

219
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,840
connect globally via the internet and all of this. So of

220
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,160
course, nature would be using the same thing. And I remember

221
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,160
looking it's up at some point in one of your papers, right, of

222
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,320
like, when you get a wound, the first thing that happens is

223
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,800
electrical communication, and then the molecules. And then I

224
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,320
was at some point thinking like, one of the things I did, I

225
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,640
mean, shit, every day all day was running Jell-O-Lusher

226
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,520
freezes in a lab, right? Yeah, you're generating an electric

227
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,480
field to put your proteins where you want them. Why would it

228
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,840
nature be doing that, right? Itself, organizing itself using

229
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,000
electricity. So the molecules are sort of, you know, and as you

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,480
know, it's both bottom off and top down. But that, you know,

231
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,560
you're using electricity because it's the fastest way to

232
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,960
communicate from head to tail, let's say, in this organism,

233
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,400
some things up on this end, and then you bring the molecules

234
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,680
over there. Yeah. So for me, it's about sort of, yeah, speed

235
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,640
and distance. That's what I would say. Yeah.

236
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,240
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, so what kind of what are you working on

237
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,320
now, talk to, you know, talk about? Totally. Yeah. And I

238
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,320
mean, I don't know, I have a few slides I could go up, bring up

239
00:13:51,320 --> 00:14:04,480
here. Yeah. If you can see, I can't see that. Right. So this

240
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,800
isn't, we don't really have to do a formal formal thing, but

241
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,440
don't do as much as you want. Yeah, this is sort of the gist of

242
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,040
it, right? As I've alluded to is what is going on with this

243
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,960
spontaneous neural activity. And this would be an outline of

244
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,480
like sort of why somebody like me, mostly interested in

245
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,520
studying something like the human brain is some interested

246
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,880
in studying as something as simple as this hydra. And then

247
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,120
sort of that brings us into some kind of history of the

248
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,440
spontaneous neural activity, what it might be doing, the tools

249
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,360
needed to study that hydra and some of these future directions.

250
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,520
And so I don't know how much we have time for, but I'll just

251
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,440
kind of go as quickly as possible. And this is one of my

252
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,520
favorite things to start with to say, like, just imagine that

253
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,040
you're a scientist, and you're the first person to ever see an

254
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,000
image that looks like this, which is exactly what happened to

255
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,760
Golgi when he put the Golgi sound neural, like a nervous system

256
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,840
for the first time, and you're trying to make sense of what is

257
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,080
this. And he thought that this is just one giant reticular

258
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,080
mesh work. It's all one thing. And other people at this time

259
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,840
looked at basically the same image and saw something else. And

260
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,800
they zoomed in on these little shapes here would look like

261
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,560
these little pyramidal things. So Sherrington and Ramonica Hall

262
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,000
say, Oh, what about these little pyramidal things? Like, what

263
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,440
those are how this works? What are those are the functional

264
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,160
units of this system?

265
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,400
By the way, sorry, could I ask the Golgi stain? Was that random?

266
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,920
Was he just trying random chemicals? Or did he have some

267
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,080
idea that that was going to stain something interesting?

268
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,720
I have no idea. Honestly, I would have to look that's a great

269
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,000
question that he like why how that ended up happening. But

270
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,080
before that, like, there was no ability to sort of see what it

271
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,560
looked like. So there was all kinds of speculations, I think

272
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,880
on behavior and all of that, but no real way to see or

273
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,840
visualize the nervous system. And then what you do, then you've

274
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,080
got to make sense of it, right? I think like, this is just a

275
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,840
fundamental thing about science. It's like, first of all, the

276
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,080
method that you use to view the thing will determine what you

277
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,840
see. And this is exactly what happens in Neil Thies. We'll

278
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,320
talk about this. And so this was happening at the same time as

279
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,360
you know, cell theory with Schleiden Schwann, because at

280
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,840
that time, they see cell boundaries, they see lipid

281
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,600
membranes. And so they're like, Oh, what the functional unit of

282
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,880
that system of non neural tissues is cells. But Neil will make

283
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,000
the point, if you had just had a nuclear stain, what you would

284
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,840
have seen is just a bunch of dots floating in liquid, you

285
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,280
wouldn't have known that there were these things called

286
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,600
membranes as you had sort of an Eastern conception of what's the

287
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,280
functional unit of tissue, right? It would be like, Oh, it's

288
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,680
fluid with a bunch of dots floating in it. So here, you

289
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,820
have this at the beginning, right, like this whole picture of a

290
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,860
nervous system. And then you're arbitrarily deciding which

291
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,420
parts are separate from the rest. And so the decision at that

292
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,380
point was sort of, we're going to go with cell theory, and the

293
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,900
neuron doctrine that these little pyramidal shaped things are

294
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,660
the units. And at the same time, Sherrington was going nuts on

295
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,700
in reflex arcs. So that sort of solidified this idea that the

296
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,340
not only the structural unit might be a single neuron, but

297
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,740
the functional one, because you hit your knee, you get one

298
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,780
sensory neuron that goes in synapses on another motor neuron

299
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,940
your spinal cord, and that's your reflex, right? So that sort

300
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,940
of gave them two ideas. A, that single neurons are the

301
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,060
functional units. And that B, the nervous system is doing

302
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,940
nothing unless you stimulate it from the outside. So those are

303
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,940
just these two sort of major paradigms taken from mostly

304
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,980
spinal cord peripheral nervous system is sort of applied to the

305
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,140
cortex. And that must be how it works. But I would argue that

306
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,700
those two major ideas have left us in a situation where you

307
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,700
still don't really know the true functional unit, at least of

308
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,460
cortex or non spinal cord peripheral nervous systems

309
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,460
really are. Is it multiple neurons? Is it all one thing? Is

310
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,540
it some amount of, let's say, ensemble, how many neurons are

311
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,700
in ensemble? How do those things interact to generate

312
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,060
complex cognitive states? And how do those go awry in

313
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,340
neuropsychiatric disorders?

314
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,380
Do you think that? Do you think there's a single objective

315
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,420
answer to that question? Like, is there a, you know, the the

316
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,660
optimal subunit or is that where do you think it's more of a

317
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,820
observer dependent kind of, you know,

318
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,420
Oh my God, yes, we got to skip his head till like 20 slides

319
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:27,900
from now. But

320
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,660
no problem. Keep keep keep going.

321
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,660
Totally. And yeah, and I think I think it's I think there's

322
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,660
again, what I'm most interested in, which I think most people

323
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,140
are, are general principles. And I think this is going to be,

324
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,500
there'll be general principles in that there's not one answer of

325
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,860
like, what a functional unit is in a particular system, but the

326
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,940
general way that that works, I think will probably be general.

327
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,980
And so yeah, I don't need to introduce a complex adaptive

328
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,020
system to you, but maybe other people, if anyone ever sees

329
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,260
this would be interested. So basically, it's just you have a

330
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,980
bunch of individual simple systems or subunits, right at this

331
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,300
level of scale. And I should just say that why am I talking about

332
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,940
that? I'm saying because if the brain is actually this complex

333
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,340
adaptive system, maybe we're studying at the wrong level of

334
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,420
scale, we can't see the functional units because we're

335
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,900
studying one thing at a time. So this is a bunch of units,

336
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,580
right, these can be anything, these can be electrons in the

337
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,020
magnet, water molecules and water, ants and ant colony birds

338
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,660
and flock or neurons in a nervous system. The key is you put

339
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,100
enough of them together and they follow simple rules. And if we

340
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,060
just think of this as an electron simplest example, you

341
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,220
have an electron that spin up and its neighbors spin down and

342
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,860
it needs to become a spin down. And you put enough of them

343
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,980
together and critically that won't happen with one electron or

344
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,940
10 electrons and it's a property of many electrons, you get this

345
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,140
emergent phenomenon of the higher level scale. In this case,

346
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,380
it'd be like magnetism, right? And then that higher level scale

347
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,260
can feedback down and coordinate and constrain the lower lower

348
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,180
level. And the key here right is that you you're never going to

349
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,300
see magnetism if you're looking at this level here at this

350
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,660
single electron, you're only going to see it up here if

351
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,020
you're looking at a higher level of scale. And that level of

352
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,540
scale also is going to be following sort of totally

353
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,900
different rules than this level of scale. So if that's what

354
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,020
we're trying to do in neuroscience in general, we

355
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,500
think of this as a TV screen. Like, you know, for the most of

356
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,180
the history of neuroscience, we've been doing these single

357
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,900
pixels at a time, you know, single unit electrophysiology,

358
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,860
which of course is critical, we need to do that, we had to

359
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,140
understand what a neuron is, and doing that one at a time, but

360
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,660
you can't really see the whole picture at once. Alternatively,

361
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,340
you can zoom out and do things like I was saying MRI, EEG, MEG,

362
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,180
these kinds of things, you get a global view, but it's very low

363
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,500
spatial temporal resolution. So you can sort of tell that

364
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,100
something's happening. But it's hard to sort of see what that

365
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,660
is. So the ultimate goal then, right, is to just look at that

366
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,380
TV screen with single pixel resolution to sort of see, okay,

367
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,660
now that we can see all these individual neurons, what picture

368
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,220
is emerging at this higher level scale, what can we see by just

369
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,420
looking at it, right? And again, I'm interested in this big

370
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,420
thing here, the human brain, given that I'm interested in the

371
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,180
human mind and helping these kinds of folks. But it's huge,

372
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,100
it's 86 billion neurons with trillions of connections, it's

373
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,300
not going to fit under the microscope and all of that. So

374
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,500
you can simplify that problem, you can do it in a mouse brain,

375
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,260
right? But even here, how are you going to get all this

376
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,700
hardware in here, record all those neurons, and even if you

377
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,060
do that optically, if I don't know, right now, we're up to,

378
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,300
let's say, let's be generous, I think I'm really arresting by

379
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,380
saying 20,000 neurons, that's out of 71 million. So it's just

380
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,460
really not much of the whole TV screen, let's say. So you could

381
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,260
simplify this even further. And you can do zebrafish, right?

382
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,980
And Drosophila and even CL again, but even these systems are

383
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,380
still quite complex. Depending on the, you know, developed stage

384
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,900
of the zebrafish, you can have up to 10 million neurons still

385
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,100
and lots of different cell types, and they're all, I think,

386
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,980
importantly, sort of shoved together in these complex brains

387
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,700
and ganglia that are also sort of hard to disentangle. So

388
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,580
Sidney Brenner sat down with my mentor, Rafa, who we all know,

389
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,060
Sidney was the one who pioneered the work on C. elegans. And he

390
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,020
said, that's even still too complicated, right? What if we

391
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,900
try something even simpler? Let's do Hydra, which has 200 to

392
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,260
2000 neurons, depending on the size of the animal. And

393
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,460
depending on how you cut off the cell sequencing, single cell

394
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,060
sequencing data, you get 11 to 12, maybe 13 different neural

395
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:27,580
cell types. And it doesn't have a true brain or ganglia as you'll

396
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:33,860
see momentarily. I gotta get that off there. Okay, I say. Right.

397
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,220
So then it also not only is it simple, but it's an interesting

398
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,620
position on the evolutionary tree, at least as far as I'm

399
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,820
concerned, it's right after and quotes the non neural lineage,

400
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,380
and then right before the bilaterians, which is the branch

401
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:52,740
of life that we're sort of used to studying. And neuroscience,

402
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,940
where you have a central midline structure structure and a

403
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,940
left and a right side. Whereas the Nigerians are sort of

404
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,300
totally radially symmetric, they don't have any of those

405
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,700
things. So it's it's another instance where you can sort of

406
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,100
say, Hey, what are these general principles? This nervous

407
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,220
system looks nothing like that one. And yet it's able to

408
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,100
generate complex behavior. Does it matter what the

409
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,180
architecture of this nervous system is? Because it's

410
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,100
seemingly, right? Everyone's very interested and obsessed with

411
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,660
getting those the circuit diagrams, right? But does that

412
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,820
matter? Can you get complete essentially the same

413
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,700
functionality out of completely different architectures? And I

414
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:36,500
think that's probably what we'll find if we look. How do I go

415
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,100
forward? Oh, there we go. So, so this is just what an actual

416
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,620
hydra looks like with its mouth, tentacles, foot, and then this

417
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,820
hydra buds. So this is going to be important in a second,

418
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,700
because hydra can reproduce asexually. So hydra essentially

419
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,860
just can clone itself with it. You keep feeding these animals

420
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,340
instead of them just getting infinitely big or long. They

421
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,020
start budding and reproducing and making a genetically

422
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:06,900
identical copy, right? I think it's critical for you. And then

423
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,060
they can also reproduce sexually too. So the same

424
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:16,660
animal can their stem cells can then generate testes or ovaries

425
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:23,220
or an egg here and reproduce sexually. So either way. And

426
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:29,140
then right, so again, it has essentially not exactly the same

427
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:33,940
but 20,000 genes very similar to our genome, right? So the genes

428
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,380
here are are essentially the same thing as your eye and yet

429
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,860
it's building something completely different. And then

430
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,540
it's small so it can be anywhere from 500 or one, one and a

431
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,540
half centimeters. And I'm currently sort of figuring out

432
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:51,100
what's the smallest one we can get to to make so that we can fit

433
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,700
that really under the field of view. Transparent, robust, you

434
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,220
can do all kinds of things to this thing. And then

435
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,300
interestingly also is that it completely regenerates its

436
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,620
nervous system every 20 days. So it's constantly making this

437
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:09,260
nervous system and maintaining itself somehow. Right. A lot

438
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,420
of molecular tools being developed. And then it has

439
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,660
these well-defined behaviors. So these are just so it's

440
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,020
resting, right? Just laying there doing nothing. And then

441
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,700
can just do a very simple longitudinal contraction where

442
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,340
it goes from long to short. And then the opposite of that is

443
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,060
elongation. So it goes from short to long. And then it has

444
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,660
complex behaviors. I mean, these are arbitrary words I'm

445
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,420
defining. I'm just saying these are more complex. And this one

446
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,060
is eating. So in lab, you feed hydra, artemianopoly, just

447
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,380
brine shrimp. And this is just glutathione, reduced glutathione

448
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,180
will also have them do this feeding response. So they'll

449
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,460
rip open. So they'll use their tentacles to capture shrimp,

450
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,980
rip open, rip open in their mouth and shove a bunch of them

451
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,340
inside of their body. And then the most complex, I would say is

452
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,500
somersalting. So it will reach out, stick its head and

453
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,180
tentacles down, contract, release its foot, flip over, and

454
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,260
then put its foot back down. So in this way, it can sort of

455
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,660
in quotes, walk. So it can do all of this with a very, very

456
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,460
simple nervous system. And so this is just some quick, yep.

457
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,020
Sorry, sorry, could I just ask on the on the behavior side? Does

458
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:19,140
anybody do? Has anybody checked various learning training? Can

459
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,540
you teach these things anything?

460
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,580
Right. So this is this is the new frontier. But there it's also

461
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:30,020
the new old frontier. So as is all science, that that there were

462
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,540
some old studies, I think some of the first was 1900 and then

463
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:41,060
1950 of habituation in Hydra. So if you just sort of if you

464
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,740
pinch them, or even stick an electrode in them, they'll

465
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,740
contract. And if if you keep doing that over and over again,

466
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,060
with it with the proper inter stimulus interval, they'll

467
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,060
stop, they'll habituate. But that hasn't there hasn't been like,

468
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,460
in the last, I don't know, 50 years, any of that has not been

469
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,260
repeated. And and I don't think it's because people have tried

470
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,220
and failed. I think most people haven't really revisited that.

471
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:18,300
But yeah, that's, that's on the docket. Yeah, and, and I mean,

472
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,660
there's so I guess, was I think it was nematostellas showing

473
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,340
associative learning there. So other Nigerians now have been

474
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,220
shown to be doing, you know, more complex things than meet the

475
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:36,340
eye. Right. So you get this hypostome. This is just a cartoon

476
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,020
of the same thing, this nerve net, the tentacles. This is where

477
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,700
they would have the buds coming off. This is the basal disc. And

478
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,340
this is the tissue. So it's a just two layers. It's not a true

479
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,020
three layer thing. There's no true mesoderm. There's just the

480
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,060
endoderm on the inside and the extra term on the outside. And

481
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,220
it's thought that all of these, these are also myo epithelial

482
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,780
cells, they're epithelial cells with, let's just go over there

483
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,100
like muscle processes at the bottom. So they're sort of a

484
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,740
dual cell type. And then it's thought that all of those are

485
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,620
connected by gap junctions. And then you have your nerve net in

486
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,940
the endoderm with sensory neurons poking into the inside of

487
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,020
the gut, and then ganglion neurons in the ectoderm with

488
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,860
sensory neurons poking out to the outside environment. And it's

489
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,500
thought that these do not communicate. But I think that

490
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,780
might not be accurate. But that's the current idea. And then

491
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,420
these three different cell types, you have eye cells, which are

492
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,300
the stem cells that make the germ cells, the gland cells,

493
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:36,060
nomadicides, which are specific to, to Nigeria are super cool cell

494
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,380
type that shoot out darts, like with toxins, essentially, and

495
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,940
then neurons. And then these all cell-free new. So the eye cells

496
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,140
make these four and the ectoderm and endoderm cell-free

497
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,180
new themselves also. So that's sort of just the gist of that.

498
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,860
And then this is the current view of sort of the connectome, if

499
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,300
you will, of Hydra. So this is from Charlie David at LMU using

500
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:03,020
anti-kid heron antibody that they've just shown sort of stains

501
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,020
all of the neurons in the animal. And it looks, you know,

502
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,060
like, again, this could just diffuse nerve net. And in the

503
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,820
ectoderm, it's sort of this north-south highway where you

504
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,100
have more of a bipolar neuron. And in the endoderm, it's a

505
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,620
more multipolar thing that's sort of going more radially

506
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,820
around the animal. And then again, this is from Rob Steele at

507
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,660
Irvine, where this is just GFP expressed in eye cells. And you

508
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,420
can see that there appears to be a little bit of a condensation

509
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,580
of neurons in the, in the foot and in the head. And again, I

510
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,580
think this is another thing to keep in mind that what we're

511
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,580
seeing is depending on the tool that we're using to look at this

512
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:45,020
thing. So which is true. Yes, they're both true. But when you

513
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,340
look at that, it's unclear, like how that there's no obvious

514
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,260
circuitry, there's no anything that you say that would really

515
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,980
tell you just looking at that structure, how that's going to

516
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,780
function. Is it functioning as one thing as many things who

517
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:03,060
knows, until Christoph put in G camp six. So this is a molecule

518
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:07,420
that will fluoresce every time the neuron fires. And you, he

519
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,140
made a transgenic animal expressing this in the eye

520
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,180
cells. So all of the neurons had G camp six expressed, he then

521
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,420
put the hydra in between two cover slips. So this is just a

522
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,620
hundred micron spacer, it's swimming around in hydra media,

523
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,940
so it can still behave in two dimensions. And then just put

524
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,940
this on a normal white field microscope, and came up with a

525
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,860
movie that looks like this. So it's sort of, you know, this

526
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,500
can you see all the pixels in the movie at the same time. And

527
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,380
when you do, what do you see? Are they all firing completely

528
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,140
independently, total chaos? No, and are they all firing as one

529
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,020
thing? No, it's, it's something else. And in order to figure

530
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,260
out what the something else was, Christoph had to painstakingly

531
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,660
circle every one of those neurons and track it over time to

532
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,940
analyze that data and figure out what, what is happening here

533
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,020
and came up with this sort of general model, and saying that

534
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,860
out of that seemingly simple nerve net, you have these three

535
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,340
independent sort of units, ensembles or circuits, however

536
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,220
you want to call that groups of neurons that are co firing

537
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,180
together. And the one that's most consistently associated with

538
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,940
muscle activity is CB, where every time it fires, you get a

539
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,500
longitudinal contraction. So it gets shorter. That's very, very

540
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,700
clear that that's motor. These other two are less clear rhythm

541
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,220
potential one and rhythm potential two. But the potential

542
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,900
two in that early paper was most associated with radial

543
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,700
contraction. So that's in the end of the animal, when that

544
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,780
fires, it gets skinnier and can do some ingestion. So it will

545
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,060
spit its food out or water, let's say from its mouth. And then

546
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:42,780
rhythm potential one is in the ectoderm. And when it fires in

547
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:47,940
that paper was correlated with elongation toward light. But

548
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,340
what was most interesting to me was that this was also

549
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,940
happening when the when the animals just sitting there

550
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,340
doing nothing, just there. And that again, is not new. We're

551
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,820
noticing a thing. Reading literature is helpful. So that

552
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,940
this was found in the 60s by Pisano and McCullough, where

553
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,140
they were just sticking an electrode into Hydra. And they

554
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,860
found the same thing that there was this rhythmic, you know,

555
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,340
firing of some kind of neural network in the animal, they

556
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,900
didn't have access to, they just knew that this was happening

557
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,700
with their electrode when the animals doing nothing. And they

558
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,300
were called this cryptic activity, they said, What the

559
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,260
hell is this doing? Right? Because again, at the time, the

560
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,780
idea is that the nervous system is there to generate

561
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,500
behavior. Otherwise, it's off. Why at the base of the Tree of

562
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,100
Life, the simplest nervous system, are we seeing all kinds of

563
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,660
activity going on? If it's not generating behavior? And so

564
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,660
he hypothesized in one of his early papers, that is this

565
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,260
thing, coordinating the nervous system, sort of the

566
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,580
quarterback of the thing, the conductor, whatever metaphor you

567
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,420
want to use. And I've been told that he went off and started

568
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,020
selling bikes. And so never finished that work. And so we

569
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,740
don't know. But it was discovered there, right with

570
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,100
an electrode, and it was discovered rediscovered, let's

571
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,340
say with calcium. So it's method independent that you find the

572
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,060
same sort of thing. And that is what got me interested and

573
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,620
brings us to this very brief history of what we know about

574
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,580
simultaneous neural activity, which is very little. Because as

575
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,460
I was saying, Sherrington at that time, the big mantra was

576
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:21,220
reflexive brain, it's doing nothing. Otherwise, but his

577
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,780
own student actually was finding something very different

578
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,260
than that. And he sort of, he cut the head off of a cat and

579
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,820
deafferented the cat, no sensory input whatsoever, zero input to

580
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:37,020
a nervous system, he had all kinds of activity going on to

581
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,860
the point where the cat could still walk. So this was clearly

582
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,420
internally generated neural activity had nothing to do with

583
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,420
outside input. But that was just ignored. I was like, whatever,

584
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:50,500
that guy's nuts. Whatever he's up to, let him do that. And then

585
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,700
at the same time, or around the same time, Hans Berger was

586
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,500
inventing the EEG, EEG, we have humans. I'm just sitting in a

587
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,700
chair, all kinds of electrical activity going on there as well.

588
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,020
And like I was saying, so it wasn't just Poisson and McCulloch

589
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,100
discovering this spontaneous activity in hydra, it was sort

590
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,860
of anybody looking at any Nigeria, we're sort of discovering

591
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,140
this kind of thing going on. But of course, no one's talking to

592
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,060
each other. And so no one knows. And so it wasn't, of course,

593
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,940
until the 2000s when Raeckel and others at WashU put humans into

594
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:25,740
fMRI scanners. And at the time, right, it's sort of what was

595
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:29,300
interesting is the task evoked activity. Anything else that you

596
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,740
couldn't explain was seen as noise, like white noise on the

597
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,700
TV, get rid of it. What we're interested in is what happens to

598
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,980
the brain when you go to do the task. But at some point, he was

599
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,820
like, Hey, all of those areas in the brain that are active at

600
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,660
rest seem to be specific. And they're specifically inhibited

601
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:50,020
when the person is going to do the task. So he called up this

602
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,180
default mode network, which became like, you know, a very hot

603
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,940
topic, and has reignited interest in study of spontaneous

604
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,460
neural activity, which we now know is one of the most highly

605
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,660
conserved aspects of all brains. And so this is from

606
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,220
Busacchi's review, and that spans a wide range of frequencies

607
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:13,660
to 600 Hertz, very ultra pass all the way down to ultra slow of

608
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,740
like the point one to point one Hertz. And this is something

609
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,380
that's found in all mammalian brains, regardless of size or

610
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,060
structure, you find this, right? And I think the current idea is

611
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,860
that that's just noise, right? That's reverb, you have a

612
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,100
complex enough electrical system, you're going to get

613
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,780
oscillations, it's not functional, it's not relevant,

614
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,340
it's an epiphenomenon of the system. It's not doing anything.

615
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,980
And I think one of the reasons that that still is the idea is

616
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,220
because you can't really image it or manipulate them in a

617
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,660
specific way to determine if you if you manipulate this

618
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,860
oscillation, in particular, does that do anything? Or what

619
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:00,540
does it do? But again, it's taking 20% total body energy and

620
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,980
one of the most highly conserved aspects of all brains that we've

621
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:07,180
looked at. So the question is why or what is it doing? And

622
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,980
again, one of the most highly studied is the default mode

623
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,700
network in humans. And this is related to the self in theory.

624
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,180
So it's most active at rest, it's going on all the time and its

625
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,340
function continues to be debated. But it's thought to be

626
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,140
involved when you're internally focused. So you're either

627
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,900
remembering your past, thinking about yourself right now or

628
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,380
contemplating your future. And the same sort of midline

629
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,540
structures that I'll show you in a second appear to be

630
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:39,300
activated when you're doing self related processing. So if I'm

631
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,300
shown a picture of a stranger versus myself, the default mode

632
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,460
network lights up when I'm looking at something related to

633
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,500
the self. And that's in any modality, whether that's pictures,

634
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,900
whether that's hearing my voice, those kinds of things. So and

635
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,220
then also it's linked to a number of neuropsychiatric

636
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,980
disorders. And so you can't throw like a dart at PubMed right

637
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,420
now and not see the default mode network link to something. And

638
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,420
the way I'm simplifying that is to say that the general idea

639
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:09,900
seems to be that you have states like depression and anxiety

640
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,100
when you're too internally focused, the default mode network

641
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,620
is too active. This is associated with rumination and

642
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:19,420
worry and depression and anxiety and vice versa. When in

643
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,020
states like psychosis, psychedelic meditation, when

644
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,020
you disrupt the default mode network, this leads to in quotes

645
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,860
ego dissolution. So some of the best data that there are in human

646
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,260
studies are when you put humans in and that they can self

647
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:37,900
report, you know, on either psilocybin, LSD or DMT, that

648
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,620
whatever they think they are sort of dissolved, and then you

649
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:44,220
can see what happened in the MRI scanner. And that correlates

650
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,260
with disruption of the default mode network. So the question is

651
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,300
how how why or how would that have anything to do with the

652
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,180
self? What would be the mechanism by which the

653
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,100
development network could implement something like a

654
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,620
self? And there's sort of, you know, the structural argument

655
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,100
and the functional argument, the structural argument being that

656
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,980
it's a central midline structure. So medial prefrontal

657
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,060
cortex, the posterior cingulate, the medial temporal lobes, that

658
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,740
these are sort of these major rich hubs in the brain that are

659
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,460
connecting regions that would otherwise be segregated, right?

660
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,340
So you can imagine if you had a brain where the visual cortex

661
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,500
was not talking to the auditory cortex is not talking to the

662
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,540
olfactory cortex, and it was not talking to the internal

663
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:28,700
brainstem system, that you know, that would be a disintegrated

664
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,220
system. So is this this sort of central midline superhighway

665
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,700
with these thickly malignated axons connecting all of those

666
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,740
brain areas sort of getting input from all of them and then

667
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,740
maybe getting sending information back. So that's sort of

668
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,420
the structural thing. And then the functional piece is that

669
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,300
it's one of the lowest frequency oscillators in the brain of

670
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:54,300
0.01 to 0.1 Hertz. And this is where we got to go real crazy.

671
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,740
And this is now finally going to answer your question about the

672
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:03,860
observers in the brain, which is so Buzaki was saying, right,

673
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:08,820
like, this is what we've been doing as a neuroscientist is

674
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,540
looking at things from a quote unquote, third party, third

675
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,060
party objective view, you're looking at a brain with a bunch

676
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,740
of squiggly activity, and then you're looking at its output,

677
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,780
this behavior, and you're correlating those two things. And

678
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,900
you can say, Okay, if I see this squiggly activity, then I

679
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,860
can predict that the animal, whatever organism is going to

680
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,060
do this behavior. And that's helpful for us. And that's very

681
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,980
useful clinically, right, we could use that. But that's not

682
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,700
understanding. That's not what the brain is doing. The brain has

683
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,580
to observe itself, the neurons have to observe their own

684
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:46,220
information, and then decide sort of in quotes, decide what what

685
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:52,860
to do. So, right, so if you think of neuron A, B, and C

686
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,380
here, neuron A has to sort of observe the upstream activity

687
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,780
from its inputs neurons one, five, and nine. And in order to do

688
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,980
that, it has to be integrating that information over a certain

689
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,860
period of time. And let's just say that's 100 milliseconds. So

690
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:12,420
it reads that information and decides and not decides whatever

691
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,060
word you want to use, will fire or not, right? Based on that

692
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,260
that upstream input and same thing with B and C. So you can

693
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,860
think of those as sort of the highest frequency oscillators in

694
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:27,300
the system, the letters, if you want, in the neural code. Then

695
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,220
the downstream observer of A, B, and C is Q, let's say it has to

696
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,420
read out the input from A, B, and C, and therefore has to be

697
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,660
integrating that input over a longer period of time to give

698
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,060
time to for A, B, and C to give it its input. So that would then

699
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,380
say integrate over 200 milliseconds. So it then reads

700
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,260
out A, B, and C. And so reading out, let's say, cab a neural

701
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,820
word. So looking over here, that would be like this frequency.

702
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,500
And so you could say you would go from letters to neural words,

703
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,740
and then this is going to read over a longer time scale to get

704
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,100
inputs from those to form sentences, and then paragraphs

705
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,660
and all the way down. And so is it possible that you have this

706
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,060
thing that's the lowest frequency oscillator, getting all of

707
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,180
the input on the longest time scale in the entire nervous

708
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,900
system to read all of that information out? And so this is

709
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:19,180
just sort of a picture of what that might look like, placed on

710
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,420
top of the brain. And I like to think of this in terms of the

711
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,220
visual cortex is sort of the easiest for me to conceptualize.

712
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:30,020
And if we think of this little red thing here as the highest

713
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,940
frequency oscillator, sort of the letter of the neural code, if

714
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,140
that's coding in the visual cortex, at least for the

715
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:40,100
simplest thing like edges in the visual field, then the next

716
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,060
layer, layer two is getting input from that layer. And that

717
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,860
has to be reading that over a longer period of time. So it

718
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,700
has enough time to get input from, let's say two edges for it

719
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,460
to read out a higher level abstract concept or shape that

720
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:57,780
looks like this. And then the next lowest layer, lower

721
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,180
frequency reading out the input from layer two, right over a

722
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,540
longer time scale, so that it has time to read out this shape

723
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,260
and this shape to form a higher level abstract concept of this

724
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,740
shape, all the way down, right, to the lowest frequency

725
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,940
oscillator, the, let's say in this case, the default network

726
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,180
that's reading out all of the visual information, the auditory

727
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,020
information, the somatosensory information, the factory and

728
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,220
internal state of the organism. And in that way, getting all of

729
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,540
the highest level view, the highest abstract view of both

730
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,780
the external environment, the world in the internal

731
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:34,140
environment of the organism or the self. Right. So that's sort

732
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,340
of, okay, can it, can it be the reader, sort of the integrator

733
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:41,580
of the information, but then can it also be the coordinator top

734
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,860
down? And in this way, we sort of went through that diagram, but

735
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,380
in this case, if we're thinking, is it possible that these low

736
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:54,780
frequency oscillators can essentially organize higher

737
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,380
frequency oscillators through various mechanisms of cross

738
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,180
frequency coupling of like phase phase coupling, phase

739
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,140
amplitude coupling and these kinds of things. So is it possible

740
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,340
that this lowest frequency oscillator is essentially sort

741
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,620
of critical for setting up this hierarchy of oscillators and

742
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,460
organizing them in sort of space and time in the brain, such

743
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,580
that if you get rid of it, that organization, that hierarchy

744
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,980
might disappear. And there's some evidence, right, that when you

745
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,900
give humans psychedelics, the brain goes into a more disordered

746
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,140
or chaotic state. And it's unclear totally. If, if you get

747
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,540
rid of this default mode network, do you get something like

748
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,420
this, where you have all these other oscillators that are all

749
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,460
like this or do the oscillators themselves go completely out of

750
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,980
order and you just get complete chaos, right? And it seems to

751
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,860
me that it's not the latter of that complete chaos, because it

752
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,060
seems like, you know, if people report psychedelic

753
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,500
experiences, it's like, they're still having some kind of

754
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,580
experience, it's just less order that you might be having those

755
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,580
ensembles playing in a different order than you normally would.

756
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,460
So all this is complete speculation, right? And so it's

757
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,660
because it's very difficult, like I said, to image or

758
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,660
manipulate human brain. So luckily, this thing appears to be

759
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:07,180
highly conserved. So you have humans, monkeys, rats, a hierarchy

760
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,820
of brain white oscillations have been found a bunch of insects

761
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,380
also. And then this gets into some, you know, really out there

762
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,640
stuff where we're talking about finding these things in even in

763
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,220
systems that don't have a nervous system. So people have

764
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,580
been looking at this kind of thing in plants for a long

765
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,300
time, when you just put a microelectrode array in their

766
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:30,740
root, and you see these kinds of, let's say electrical spikes in

767
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:34,540
plants that Belusca and others have been saying for a long time

768
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,140
might be involved in information integration and

769
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:41,280
communication plant wide. And then Adamatsky putting this, these

770
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,860
electrodes into oyster mushrooms, and just finding the same

771
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:52,060
thing, like, yeah, these, these global organism wide electrical

772
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:56,860
spikes. Yeah, and this animal that he's doing all kinds of

773
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,420
interesting things to about is this is this is a fungal

774
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:03,300
language. And that kind of thing. And then same thing with

775
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:08,180
amoeba, finding these low frequency, I guess, electrical

776
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,580
like oscillations or spikes, it's unclear what they're made of,

777
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,780
right, in that case, and then bacteria here in single cells

778
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,700
when I'm going first made the voltage indicators of putting

779
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,280
those into single cells, and seeing that even bacteria are

780
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,280
having these low frequency electrical oscillations, that

781
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,560
then if you play that movie too, and you didn't, and I didn't

782
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,840
tell you that those are bacteria, you might think that those

783
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:37,240
aren't like a dish of neurons, you know, flashing. And then,

784
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,680
once you put them together, as you know, into a biofilm, right,

785
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,120
so those individual bacteria, you put them together, they, they

786
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:50,720
generate these global sort of biofilm wide potassium waves

787
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,760
that help them coordinate themselves as one giant unit,

788
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,800
and then not only can they do that with themselves, but they

789
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,160
can do this, you know, long range. So biofilm one wants to

790
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,280
eat, and biofilm two wants to eat. If there's enough nutrients,

791
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,440
they eat at the same time. But if there's not, they can

792
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,280
coordinate nutrient sharing, and then they sort of oscillate in

793
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,360
anti phase. So the general idea then just being that are these

794
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:21,760
low frequency electrical oscillations, right, ways to

795
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,000
coordinate otherwise autonomous units into coherent holes, no

796
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,160
matter where you are with or without a nervous system. Right,

797
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,120
so this, this gets a little bit, you got to take a lot of drugs

798
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:37,160
to watch this, but this is, this is what I just showed you,

799
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,000
right, we're all very used to this, the neural tissue being

800
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,560
electrical, you get ions flowing through. And, and that's how

801
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,600
you, you know, you generate action potentials, we're all

802
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:52,320
used to that. But this is where people get confused, okay, hung

803
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,360
up, where you're leading the chart, this is, this is what

804
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,480
yeah, like when I when I learned of your stuff, I was like, no

805
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,800
way. So yeah, it's like, of course, this is how this works.

806
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,320
Um, it's just a different, it's just slower, right, people for

807
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,680
really hard time. And I think this is going to be out there,

808
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,680
but like, I'm excited to think of like, different scales of

809
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,360
like, planetary or really small, we can't deal with. And it's

810
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,560
like, even in the biological sphere, we can't deal with like

811
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:22,520
different spatial stuff. But yeah, this is just, it's just

812
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,400
slower. So you can have ions flowing through gap junctions

813
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,760
and non neural tissue. And this, you know, I'd be very curious

814
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,120
to know what you think or what you're finding in terms of any

815
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:42,440
of these, let's say, non neural bioelectric networks. If, if

816
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,160
you're finding anything of the sort, if there are, there are

817
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,960
any kind of like, you know, higher frequency oscillations or

818
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,640
lower frequency oscillations, and if there's any of that, that

819
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:56,400
that's sort of organizing even the non neural tissue, we can get

820
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,920
there in a second. But that would be the idea is it's a very

821
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,640
similar thing as I was just saying up here that, yeah, you

822
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,080
have individual cells that would be, you know, that the voltage

823
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,280
there, if there's some kind of fluctuation would be also

824
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,960
some higher frequency. And those can be sort of put into

825
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,720
groups of a lower frequency to form, let's say, a subunit, like

826
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,840
an arm, and then you can have a bunch of those arms being read

827
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:30,440
out, right? Yeah, okay. What time is it? Okay, yeah, yeah. And,

828
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,000
and, and on up to sort of, to sort of like build chunks of

829
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,760
bodies based on on a similar, let's say principle of these

830
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:46,360
voltage circuits, being read out by lower and lower frequency

831
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,760
oscillators. And then in single cells, is this possible that

832
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,720
instead of proteins being sort of just the structural units of

833
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,000
cells, which is what I've been taught my whole life, is it

834
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,040
possible that these things are actually themselves conducting

835
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,600
electricity, which is what I'm forgetting his name now, Stuart

836
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,600
Lindsay at Arizona has shown that you get like nano semen

837
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,720
currents flowing through all proteins, no matter he just

838
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:15,320
picked six at random, like BSA, collagen, some things that you

839
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,560
just wouldn't be like, oh, that's conducting electricity, why

840
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:23,320
would it be? So is it the case that cells are actually true

841
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,560
little living computer chips, where the proteins are forming

842
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,560
electrical circuits on and off, and that metabolism itself

843
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,280
we've been taught is sort of generating ATP and energy, but

844
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,920
it's also generating a bunch of hydrogen ions. And so is it

845
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,520
also just giving us a pool of hydrogen ions to be flowing

846
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,160
through the computer chip. So that's, that's out there, but

847
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,000
that's, that's what I was thinking on that one. Okay, so

848
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,680
right, so you can build all these things in these different

849
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,160
ways at these different scales. And, and so what might they be

850
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,720
doing again, could they be sort of maintaining systems out on

851
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,680
your criticality, right? If in the human brain, for example,

852
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,000
with the default mode network around is thought to be at

853
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,600
criticality, where I can sort of help the system form patterns

854
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:13,080
at a useful time scale. But you imagine, you can also then

855
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,960
have a system that's totally on or totally off, you either

856
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,960
have brain death, or totally on speed is a tonic chronic

857
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:24,440
seizure, or totally disordered, in terms of total total chaos.

858
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,320
And this appears to be what happens, you go towards chaos,

859
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,640
if you get rid of this organizer and at least the human

860
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,120
brain. So I don't know what happens in any of these other

861
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,240
systems, if you get rid of that. So again, integrating all the

862
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,040
bottom of electrical information in the system, and then

863
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:43,240
coordinating at top down. And so very quickly on that, not

864
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:48,200
only with this thing sort of maybe maintained the overall

865
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,880
electrical sort of organization or structure of the system,

866
00:50:51,880 --> 00:51:00,120
but then it's the spikes of that oscillator are not totally

867
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,680
constant, like a mechanical clock that you get, you know,

868
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,760
every 60 seconds, it's variable. And I think that would be

869
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,040
variable in terms of like, external and internal input,

870
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,160
so that it can sort of coordinate the entire system top

871
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,040
down and provide some kind of information about the overall

872
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,560
state of the system by how frequently it's firing. And so

873
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,440
that's complete speculation there. Low frequency, you're

874
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,800
sort of saying, okay, within a range of frequencies, everyone

875
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,680
that's local gets some kind of global piece of information

876
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,000
that's giving everyone that that knowledge that this is this

877
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,720
frequency means everything is cool, keep doing your local

878
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,160
job, however you do it. And a higher frequency signal means

879
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,720
something else to the local function. And there maybe need

880
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,760
to speed up their processes. Right. So, so again, is this is

881
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,200
this thing conserved in Hydra? And so that's sort of what I

882
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,520
want to do is just start testing this thing there. And to

883
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,080
just speed this up is to just say, does the does the Hydra

884
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,480
cell phone serve as the organizer? Sorry, organisms

885
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,600
unifier, an ultimate integrator of both its internal and

886
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,920
external input to generate coherent behavior, i.e. a

887
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,360
unified self, and I'll just breeze through. So again, just

888
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,160
to quickly say that first of all how to do all this manual

889
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,600
tracking by hand. And so what I've been spending my time

890
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,960
doing is trying to get all this automatic working with a

891
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,320
group of people in Rafa's lab to sort of make a I don't know

892
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,640
if people can see this or what, but the dual color animals so

893
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,040
that you can use that nucleus that never disappears while

894
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,280
the animals moving because keep in mind in all other neural

895
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,360
systems, you're putting a microscope on the head of the

896
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:38,120
thing. And it's not moving much, but this entire system is

897
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,640
moving. So you have to figure out a way to track it and

898
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,440
extract all of those calcium signals from each neuron and

899
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,440
end up down here with individual spikes from each of

900
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,240
those neurons. And what's another interesting or I think

901
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,440
potentially unique thing about Hydra is from Christos

902
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,240
initial work when he put an electrode in, at least in one

903
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,720
of the particular neurons in Hydra does appear that one

904
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,600
calcium spike equates to about one active potential. So just

905
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,120
using optical information from this animal, you can

906
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,960
essentially capture every spike from every neuron and get a

907
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,080
real clear picture because in other systems, a calcium is

908
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:15,400
equate to many, many active potentials in the mouse, for

909
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:20,840
example. So it's hard to have that as you only read out.

910
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,440
Okay, right. So I'll just show you really quickly this beautiful

911
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:30,520
movie. This is right. So those are the all of the the TD

912
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,720
Tomato and then the G Camp seven neurons there. So then you

913
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:39,560
can track all of that and do the signal analysis. And then you

914
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:44,040
can write then you can also do these automatic behavior

915
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,160
tracking using deep block cut so that you can do automated

916
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,560
behavior and automated neural signal and start making sense

917
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:53,080
of this stuff. And so with that, I'll just I'll just end with a

918
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,400
few like teasers, right? So like this is just to show you

919
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,560
prove that Hydra's lays there and rests and it still has this

920
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,560
neural activity which will flash in a second right there. So

921
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,360
you can start asking. So what is the relationship between

922
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,920
that network and its other two networks? Is that network

923
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,880
actually predictive of global neural activity in this animal

924
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,600
and all of those kinds of studies? What's really I think

925
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,160
unique about Hydra is this, right? These two other things

926
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,760
that you can do where this is the parent animal, this is the

927
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,840
foot in the head and this is a bud. This is an early bud

928
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,920
coming off and you can start to say, okay, this is again,

929
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,480
this is genetically identical animal. This is one slab of

930
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,120
tissue. But at some point, the genetically identical thing

931
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,240
becomes two individuals, right? And how does that happen? You

932
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:35,960
can like so, right? At this point at this stage, their

933
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,400
global neural activity is essentially looking the same

934
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,960
and their behavior is essentially the same. But at some

935
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,560
point, that tissue becomes three different individuals. So

936
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,080
this is a bud here, a bud here and the parent here, and

937
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,360
they're flashing so asynchronously, right? Like

938
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,440
different Christmas trees and they start to develop

939
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,920
completely independent behavior. So you can sort of, you

940
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,720
know, go to town on all of those kinds of questions. And

941
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,520
then you can also do all kinds of other crazy shit, which is

942
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,760
cut, make these two animals with two heads and you would

943
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,920
expect sort of like a split brain patient. You're sharing one

944
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:11,080
body, you have two heads, one foot. In this case, these, I

945
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,200
would have predicted they're gonna, you know, act

946
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,840
independently. But it's also the case that it looks like

947
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,680
Hydra's brain like the plant might be in its foot. So these

948
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:25,160
actually start acting basically the same. But you can, and I

949
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,680
didn't know if this would be possible, you can actually

950
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:31,800
break a Hydra. So if you make a split foot, then it starts

951
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,880
acting. So this was contracting independently of this foot.

952
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,840
And then all of its sort of nervousness was sort of broken

953
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,800
that it's not, it is no longer one coherent thing. So even

954
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,480
the tentacles, it's sort of the body here is, is, is, let's

955
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,520
say, flashing independently of this foot independently of

956
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,120
that one. And so it's sort of having a hard time trying to

957
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:58,840
coordinate itself as one coherent thing. Right. Right. So

958
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,200
yeah, so just to conclude that these things, you know, low

959
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,200
frequency electrical oscillations are found through the

960
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,520
living world. We don't really know what they're doing. This

961
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,640
crazy hypothesis is that are they, you know, overall

962
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,120
electrical organism organizers that can do these three

963
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,920
jobs, maintaining systems out of near criticality that if you

964
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:19,480
get rid of them, you go more towards chaos disorder. And

965
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,480
then are they integrating the little information and then

966
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,000
from that top level view, coordinating everything from

967
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,480
the top down. And then I'm going to start trying to test

968
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,840
these things out. These tools have been built. So there's the

969
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,880
the world one tour. And I'd like to thank all those people

970
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,480
that have contributed all this. And you for sitting here.

971
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,720
Yeah. That was awesome. Thank you so much. Yes. Super

972
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,480
interesting. We're going to have to, we're going to have to

973
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,400
schedule a part two because there's a bunch of things I

974
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,520
want to I want to ask you and and and also talk about this

975
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,120
the cell phone concept, both in cells and embryos and then

976
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:00,360
outside of electrophysiology in general, because we're

977
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,520
starting to see something similar in other systems that

978
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,560
are not natively electrophysiological at all. Yeah.

979
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,360
So so I think this is this is a more, you know, what you've

980
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:12,280
got here is a very kind of profound generic concept that

981
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,560
I think could apply to a lot of things. Yeah, awesome. Love

982
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:21,160
it. Yeah. All right. Thank you so much. Yeah. Great. Yeah.

983
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:26,280
We'll talk soon. All right. See you. Okay. Thanks.
