00:00.000 --> 00:14.680
I guess an underlying theme for what interests me the most, in biology and science in general,

00:14.680 --> 00:23.600
to look for simple underlying principles, and my favorite, one of my favorite costos

00:23.600 --> 00:31.200
paintings is this one that kind of illustrates that point where, as you can tell here, it goes

00:31.200 --> 00:42.960
in this series of plates depicting a bull going from removing more and more detail until it gets

00:42.960 --> 00:51.760
to the essence of the bull. And that's sort of my scientific reto that may be not fully embraced

00:51.920 --> 01:00.800
in biology, universally, as it is embraced in math and physics and chemistry. And what I think is

01:00.800 --> 01:08.960
one of the sort of big problems in the way biologists, and I mean by that mostly experimental

01:08.960 --> 01:16.080
sort of mainstream biomedical science type of biology, is that we are addicted to complicate it

01:17.040 --> 01:25.920
and devalue what's simple and often confuse it with what's simplistic. And in my definition,

01:25.920 --> 01:30.880
I'd say simple is when you get rid of anything that's not essential for understanding the problem.

01:32.080 --> 01:37.520
Simplistic is when you remove something that is important, and so it's you have to

01:37.520 --> 01:42.480
get the right intuition not to confuse it. And complicated is when you add things that are

01:42.560 --> 01:48.400
nonessential. And that's, I think we're all experiencing that phase in my medical research

01:48.400 --> 01:55.200
now where there is too much of nonessential is added because methods are available to generate data.

01:57.200 --> 02:06.160
And so that's what often makes complex systems look complicated, whereas as you all know,

02:06.160 --> 02:13.840
the complex systems are not complicated. They have underlying simple rules. So what I chose to

02:13.840 --> 02:23.840
talk about today is one of the aspects, one aspect of biology that we're interested in in lab,

02:24.560 --> 02:31.360
which has to do with tissue biology and I would say cellular sociology or

02:31.360 --> 02:37.760
social lives of cells. And because tissues are complex systems, composed of multiple

02:38.800 --> 02:44.400
agents that are cells that interact in some way and generate all kinds of properties that we try to

02:44.400 --> 02:51.280
understand. And the properties that we see, these are observables, and they don't tell us what the

02:51.280 --> 02:58.480
rules are that generated them. And that's sort of the main interest in that area for me. So we think

02:58.480 --> 03:09.840
about the notion of tissue, of course, is very familiar. It's a textbook notion. It's very commonly

03:09.840 --> 03:15.440
used. We all kind of sort of know what we mean when we say tissues, but at the same time, they're

03:15.440 --> 03:25.360
not well defined. If we try to give a definition to a cell, then we're fine to the organ to organ

03:25.360 --> 03:33.280
systems, we can give formal definitions, but for tissues, we actually can't. And all the

03:33.280 --> 03:40.880
available definitions are quite ambiguous. As our distinctions between tissues where one tissue

03:40.880 --> 03:46.800
stops and other starts and so forth. So traditional classifications that are divide them into four

03:46.800 --> 03:52.800
major types of epidial, connective, muscle, and neuronal. It has a limited utility, mostly when

03:52.880 --> 03:58.560
we think in terms of development of organism, when we think in terms of pathology, in terms of

03:59.920 --> 04:04.400
any kind of biology that operates at the tissue level, we don't think of tissues as

04:04.400 --> 04:11.360
a peculiar versus neuronal and so on. It's always we think of it as a collection of cell types that

04:11.360 --> 04:19.360
belong to all these different types of origin. So that's the first problem. So we are kind of

04:19.360 --> 04:23.760
on a shaky ground to begin with, because we're dealing with something that's ill-defined.

04:24.960 --> 04:31.040
And that leads to these major gaps in our understanding of tissues. What are the

04:31.040 --> 04:37.440
patterns of cell organization within tissues? What aspects are pre-programmed versus emergent?

04:37.440 --> 04:44.240
And what are general themes and what are special cases? And that's again,

04:44.400 --> 04:52.400
something that I think biologists depreciate less than let's say physicists, distinguishing

04:52.400 --> 04:59.840
special cases from general cases. And that's what makes this whole area so interesting and

04:59.840 --> 05:07.600
challenging and fascinating to understand. To use tissue biology as sort of an umbrella term

05:07.600 --> 05:15.920
for understanding social organization of cells to think of cells as agents in a complex system.

05:17.040 --> 05:26.480
And so this is to just illustrate what exactly our gaps in understanding are. If we compare

05:26.480 --> 05:32.640
organismal biology, cell biology, and tissue biology, it's very clear that in tissue biology we

05:32.720 --> 05:36.480
are limited by understanding, not so much by data, but by understanding.

05:36.480 --> 05:42.640
So in organismal biology, we can tell that these animals that look drastically different,

05:42.640 --> 05:50.080
they're all variations on the theme of a mammal. And we can tell that there are some deviations from

05:50.080 --> 05:59.840
the common theme that we see in whales, shrews, and so forth. But we can imagine a generic mammal

05:59.840 --> 06:04.800
with all the universal parts, all the organ systems, they all have

06:07.360 --> 06:11.680
central nervous system, two lungs, two kidneys, and so forth. And we know how they function,

06:11.680 --> 06:18.800
we connect it, and we can draw a generic like a schema of a mammal. And then we can also say that

06:18.800 --> 06:25.280
a mammal is a special case of vertebrate, which is more general schema and so forth. If we go to

06:25.280 --> 06:30.800
cells, the biology cell level is the same, we can look at this and these are dramatically different

06:31.600 --> 06:36.800
cells, dramatically different looking cells, especially if they were drawn to scale, it would

06:36.800 --> 06:43.680
be even more dramatic difference. And yet we know that this is all variation on the common theme of

06:43.680 --> 06:53.840
eukaryotic cell, mammalian cells shown here on the right. And we are not fooled by the fact that

06:53.840 --> 06:59.440
the most abundant and most easily accessible cell type, which is a red blood cell,

06:59.440 --> 07:06.480
actually doesn't have a nucleus in mammals. We don't conclude from that that most cell types

07:07.280 --> 07:15.280
don't have nucleus. And therefore, this is something essential and important to understand. So

07:15.280 --> 07:20.640
we're not confused by that because we know enough cell biology to tell that this is a special case.

07:20.640 --> 07:29.120
And the reason I'm emphasizing this is because in here, it's an obvious case of general versus

07:29.120 --> 07:35.360
special. But when we lack that understanding, we can be confused by looking at something that's

07:35.360 --> 07:41.520
most common, most observable. And we don't have the right intuition to tell if it's a general case

07:41.520 --> 07:48.960
or special case. So at tissue level, at the cell level, at organismal level, we have that type of

07:48.960 --> 07:55.360
knowledge. But if we look at the tissue level with different tissues, and then now we can tell

07:56.160 --> 08:02.880
whether these tissues coming from different organs all represent variations on a theme.

08:04.160 --> 08:10.880
And what that generic theme is, and we cannot draw that generic tissue the way we can for generic

08:10.880 --> 08:18.560
cell or generic organism. And we don't know if there is one theme, and these are also kind

08:18.640 --> 08:24.160
of deviations or variations on that theme, or there may be more than one thing, or maybe there

08:24.800 --> 08:30.080
are no common themes at all. But presumably, there are common things because all tissues

08:30.080 --> 08:37.200
have to solve the same set of problems. They have to solve a problem of having the right cell type

08:37.200 --> 08:45.440
in the right ratios, right quantities, right spatial arrangements, and so forth. They should

08:48.160 --> 08:53.360
have some of the others. And these are the same problems every tissue in every animal has to

08:53.360 --> 08:57.600
solve. And presumably, it's been solved once in the beginning, and then everything was built on

08:57.600 --> 09:03.920
that solution. And therefore, we have a reason to think that there are general principles and

09:03.920 --> 09:10.000
general themes, and everything is some variations on these themes. And some of these cases may indeed

09:10.000 --> 09:16.320
be special cases. And that's what we want to understand, and that's what we currently don't

09:16.320 --> 09:25.200
understand. So instead, we have this is a picture like this, which is a textbook picture of what's

09:25.200 --> 09:34.480
supposed to be tissue. And so the questions we want to understand is what the rules that define,

09:34.480 --> 09:39.920
for example, cellular composition of tissues, how these different cell types know that they belong

09:39.920 --> 09:46.240
there in the right amounts, in the right proportions, in the right locations, and so forth.

09:47.440 --> 09:54.480
And if we approach it from the way that generally we approach something unknown, we try to kind of

09:54.480 --> 10:00.080
catalog things, we describe them by shapes by whatever some properties that we can measure.

10:00.800 --> 10:08.720
Nowadays, we do it by single cell analysis by imaging and so forth. And we generate this ever

10:08.720 --> 10:17.360
more complete catalog of characteristics. And that catalog doesn't bring us any closer to

10:18.240 --> 10:24.160
addressing the questions I mentioned in the previous slide. And

10:26.720 --> 10:36.720
there is a little doubt that having ever more complete description of cells and tissues

10:37.520 --> 10:43.680
using whatever next generation methodologies might be that may image every single molecule,

10:43.680 --> 10:50.880
let's say, and so forth, the amount of data will grow astronomically. And yet it's not going to

10:50.880 --> 10:54.720
bring us any closer to addressing the questions that I mentioned in the previous slide.

10:56.400 --> 11:03.200
And let's just use an analogy here for, like, let's say if you're an alien and you're doing,

11:03.200 --> 11:09.200
you know, PhD thesis on human social structure, you came to Earth and you look at people and you

11:09.200 --> 11:14.480
have this very powerful alien technologies that allow you to characterize everything you want

11:14.480 --> 11:24.480
about every human being. And you get the characteristics like names, height, weight, color of

11:24.480 --> 11:33.280
eyes, color of hair, insulin, glucose measurements, heart rate, and you catalog that increasingly.

11:33.280 --> 11:42.000
You know how many cells that person has versus that person has. And clearly that kind of data

11:42.000 --> 11:46.960
would be completely useless to understand what the human social structure is.

11:48.960 --> 11:55.360
On the other hand, if you approach it from a different perspective, you look at the human

11:55.440 --> 12:04.080
social group, and you start noticing that there is some ways that these different individuals

12:04.080 --> 12:10.400
relate each other that may define not identities, like identity characteristics,

12:10.400 --> 12:16.640
like name, height, weight, and so forth, but rather that some of them are parents and some of them

12:16.640 --> 12:21.920
are children, some of them are husbands and wives, some of them colleagues, some of them friends,

12:21.920 --> 12:28.080
some enemies, and so forth. And what all these words mean, these are categories. So there's a

12:28.080 --> 12:36.080
category of the parent, category of scientists, category of neighbors. But these categories

12:36.720 --> 12:47.760
defined, if we compare category of a parent or neighbor or friend versus the category of

12:47.840 --> 12:54.080
a good person or bad person or a scientist by profession. So the profession category is still

12:54.080 --> 12:59.440
the cataloging category. It's just like the names and heights and whatever, body mass.

13:00.240 --> 13:09.760
Parent, friend, neighbor, these are categories that are defined by relations. And what I think is

13:09.760 --> 13:17.040
needed, we have the notion of a cell type, and we have increasingly detailed characteristics of

13:17.040 --> 13:22.880
cell types. And that's just like getting more and more data about individuals. But what we need is

13:22.880 --> 13:30.080
to go from cell types, which is a useful and fundamental notion, to the notion of cell categories.

13:30.080 --> 13:34.320
And the way they can be defined is just like the aliens who define social structure.

13:35.360 --> 13:43.760
They need to be defined in terms of relations. So just like relation parent child provides deep

13:43.760 --> 13:49.440
insight into social structure or relation, friends and enemies and so forth, those are provides

13:50.160 --> 13:59.440
deep insights that can explain social structure. Similarly, if we define cell relations,

14:00.560 --> 14:06.080
appropriate types of what would be the appropriate types of relations, that will give us insight

14:06.080 --> 14:14.000
into social organization of cells. And so what I think we need to do is to,

14:15.040 --> 14:18.640
rather than being obsessed with getting more and more granular data about,

14:18.640 --> 14:25.200
you know, the identity characteristics, we need to define some categories based on relations.

14:25.840 --> 14:36.160
And so we need to ask what are different cell types equivalent in some ways in terms of their

14:36.160 --> 14:41.680
roles in tissue organization. So that would define their relation, right? So if you have a teacher

14:42.320 --> 14:47.280
in one school, teacher in another school, they may teach different subjects, but they're defined by

14:47.280 --> 14:53.040
the relation of teacher and student. And if we know that relation, then we can say, okay, there's a

14:54.000 --> 14:58.960
category of teacher and there's category of student. So what are the appropriate

14:58.960 --> 15:05.520
relevant categories for cells? And also, I would mention that not all relations are equally informative.

15:06.400 --> 15:12.800
Right? So the category, some get some relations, some more fundamental than others. So the same

15:12.800 --> 15:20.800
would apply to cells. And so we can define this, what would be called equals. So relations here,

15:20.800 --> 15:31.600
I mean in more like in mathematical terms, like the way the relations are defined on sets. And they

15:31.600 --> 15:38.000
can be symmetric, reflexive, transitive. And so it's in that kind of spirit of the way that

15:38.000 --> 15:44.160
relations defines on sets, it's basically a way to partition set. So we have a set of cells and

15:44.160 --> 15:49.680
what are different ways we can partition it, just like we can take social group and partition it

15:49.680 --> 15:56.960
into parents, children, teachers, students and so forth. And that I think is what is missing and

15:56.960 --> 16:02.880
what's limiting that we don't have that kind of a perspective. And this is something we're actually

16:02.880 --> 16:08.800
working on, sort of from theory perspective, I'll just give a sense of what we're thinking now,

16:08.800 --> 16:15.840
because we don't have a complete list of that yet. So this is the visual representation of what I

16:15.840 --> 16:23.280
mean that we go from cell type paradigm, where we describe cell types, type A, B, C and D, to cell

16:23.280 --> 16:29.920
relations paradigm, which will define cell categories. And here, for example, one relation will define

16:29.920 --> 16:34.480
between these two cell types and other relation between these two cell types and so on. And

16:34.480 --> 16:40.400
importantly, this relation, let's say relation A, may apply not just for this epithelial and

16:40.400 --> 16:45.520
this mesenchymal cell, it may apply to other pairs of cells that belong to different types.

16:46.720 --> 16:51.040
And that's what's critical, because that's where we hit the wall when we try to understand

16:51.040 --> 16:56.640
general principle, and then we find, oh, macrophage is doing something here. So therefore,

16:56.640 --> 17:02.240
macrophage is a cell type, it has this kind of a property. And then we don't find that example

17:02.240 --> 17:08.880
somewhere else and say, oh, oops, it's not generalizable. It may not be generalizable for cell type,

17:08.880 --> 17:13.840
but as a relation, it would be. So that's the general idea. And what are the types of relations?

17:13.840 --> 17:21.040
So I will just use a few examples to illustrate it. And the first example also deals with the

17:21.040 --> 17:30.720
notion of what is the general theme in tissue organization. And if we think about what's the

17:30.720 --> 17:40.480
simplest setup for an animal, we would see that all animals have epithelial mesenchymal

17:41.440 --> 17:47.600
units as the most fundamental, most ancient units of organization of tissues. There are

17:47.600 --> 17:52.480
no animals that don't have epithelial mesenchymal units, even the simplest, like spongy and

17:52.480 --> 17:58.000
plecozoa, that's basically, they pretty much don't have anything else, but that's what you

17:58.000 --> 18:05.520
have to have an animal. And they always have a particular type of arrangement. Epithelial cells,

18:05.520 --> 18:12.000
of course, form a polarized sheet. Mesenchymal cells are underneath and they're separated by

18:12.000 --> 18:19.360
basically membrane. So that's a general structural setup. But what's interesting going beyond that

18:19.360 --> 18:24.880
is that there is a particular type of relation between mesenchym and epithelium. And that relation

18:25.600 --> 18:34.080
in one instance is based on a symmetry in information transfer. So mesenchymal cells,

18:34.080 --> 18:41.200
for example, have positional information encoded by Hawke's genes. That translates into the choice

18:41.200 --> 18:46.800
of appropriate morphogen signals that they produce, for example, and then epithelial cells have

18:46.800 --> 18:53.200
several fade choices. And then mesenchymal cells through this morphogen signal dictate the fade

18:53.200 --> 18:58.800
choice that would be appropriate for a given positional information. So we have this type of

18:58.800 --> 19:07.680
instructional relation here. And this is seen as a common theme in development where mesenchymal

19:07.680 --> 19:12.640
will affect the epithelium to shape it into different organs, different spatial structures

19:12.640 --> 19:18.320
and so forth. And you can particularly well see to this development of different types of glands,

19:18.960 --> 19:26.880
which you can see in the next slide even better. We can say now you go from this generic

19:26.880 --> 19:31.600
organization of epithelium mesenchymal. Mesenchymal is not shown here for simplicity.

19:31.600 --> 19:36.480
And then you can get all kinds of structures through a process of continuous transformation.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.880
So if you think about it as geometric transformation, it's an example of

19:40.880 --> 19:45.280
continuous transformation. There's nothing fundamentally new added here.

19:45.520 --> 19:50.560
All that happens is continuous transformation. These are all topologically in bearing.

19:52.000 --> 19:59.760
And that means that by just using that simple module and just adding the variables that affect

19:59.760 --> 20:07.360
the degree of branching, you can generate all sorts of structures. And from a simple gut tube,

20:07.360 --> 20:13.920
you can go to making various types of glands. And ultimately, you can make pancreas and liver

20:13.920 --> 20:19.600
and lungs and all by process of continuous transformation. So that's how powerful that

20:19.600 --> 20:24.960
effect of a relation between mesenchym and epithelium is. And of course, this goes back to

20:25.520 --> 20:31.920
Mangolton-Spemian classical experiments of transplanting epidermis from one part of a bird

20:31.920 --> 20:36.400
to another part of the bird and observing that the appendages formed by epidermis

20:37.040 --> 20:44.800
are entirely defined by the underlying dermal structure, which is underlying mesenchym.

20:45.680 --> 20:53.680
And from that came the notion that mesenchym has some information about the map of the body,

20:53.680 --> 20:59.760
which we now is encoded by Hofstein's, and that the epidermis or epithelium has several

20:59.760 --> 21:03.840
features, is in this case, forming different kinds of appendages, feathers of different

21:03.840 --> 21:11.040
sorts of scales, and that's dictated by mesenchym. So now we take that. So here we're talking as

21:11.040 --> 21:17.200
biologists, mesenchym at the dermis feathers, and we abstract from that and say, okay, we have one

21:17.200 --> 21:24.320
type of cell, let's call it M cell, doesn't have to be mesenchym. We have another type of cell,

21:24.320 --> 21:30.320
let's call it E cell, doesn't have to be epithelial. And we define this as categories based on the

21:30.320 --> 21:35.440
relation between them. And the relation is as follows. M cell has some information,

21:36.160 --> 21:42.160
in one instance, positional information. E cell has some fake choices. In one instance,

21:42.160 --> 21:47.840
this would be feathers and things like that. And M cell dictates the fake choice of E cell.

21:48.640 --> 21:54.640
And this we can generalize them and sell that these are definitions of these two categories of

21:54.640 --> 22:01.200
cell that are based on the relation between them. And now we don't have to be attached to dermals,

22:01.200 --> 22:06.560
feathers, scales and things like that. Now we can say there are two categories of cell.

22:07.120 --> 22:14.080
And in addition to dermal and epidermal, as a relation between M and E, we can have other types

22:14.080 --> 22:19.840
of biological scenarios. For example, M cell could be niche cell and E cell could be stem cell,

22:19.840 --> 22:25.360
because they also have the same relation. Niche cell defining fake choices of stem cells,

22:25.360 --> 22:30.640
cell renewal differentiation and so forth. Then we have a relation in immunology between

22:30.640 --> 22:36.400
the grid cell and T cells. So the grid cell have some information about what kind of pathogen

22:36.400 --> 22:43.520
they encounter. Naive T cells, which is T cells that haven't been yet encountered any signals,

22:44.400 --> 22:49.200
they have fake choices. They can become different types of effector cells, memory cells,

22:49.200 --> 22:54.640
so forth. What dictates that fake choice signals produced by dendritic cells? Because dendritic

22:54.640 --> 22:59.520
cells have that information, in this case it's not positional information, but information they

22:59.520 --> 23:05.520
receive from encountering pathogens. And more generally, we can say for any control circuit,

23:05.520 --> 23:10.560
including homeostatic control circuit, sensors and effectors are two types of the circuit that

23:10.560 --> 23:16.400
where sensors has some information about whatever it monitors. And the effector can do something

23:16.400 --> 23:24.960
about it. It has some choices. Thermostat and AC, for example, like thermosensor knows what

23:25.600 --> 23:31.440
temperature is. AC has options to increase or decrease, to turn on and off and so forth.

23:31.440 --> 23:37.600
Same with beta cell and liver, beta cell knows what glucose concentration liver knows what to do

23:37.600 --> 23:44.960
about it. When beta cell tells it what to do through insulin. So this is a general relation.

23:44.960 --> 23:48.640
What are other possible types of relation? I'm not going to dwell on many of them, but I will

23:48.640 --> 23:55.760
just mention one or two more. So the second type is a functional relation. And this relates to a

23:55.760 --> 24:02.560
more familiar notion of division of labor. So here we have a classical textbook division of labor,

24:02.560 --> 24:07.440
when two cells are specialized on performing two different functions, A and B, independently of

24:07.440 --> 24:14.000
each other. The second type of relation would be division of labor, would be when two cells

24:14.320 --> 24:19.440
both contribute to the same function. And if you remove either of them, there is no function.

24:20.880 --> 24:27.280
So modern neuron and skeletal muscle form the motor unit, and you need both types of cells to

24:27.280 --> 24:32.720
have that function of movement. So they are functionally complementary. So that's that's

24:32.720 --> 24:37.600
now a type of relation. Here we can say this is also a relation, but it's a null relation.

24:38.480 --> 24:43.280
Here it's a complementary functional complementarity. The third type of relation that hasn't

24:43.280 --> 24:49.440
been described in literature, but I think is equally important, is a relation when one cell

24:49.440 --> 24:55.440
type is specialized on a particular function. Another cell type is fully dedicated just

24:55.440 --> 25:00.640
supporting the function of the other cell. So example would be, for example, again,

25:00.640 --> 25:07.920
this could be modern neuron, and the supporting cell would be Schwann cell. So the whole purpose

25:07.920 --> 25:12.880
of life for Schwann cell is to support function of the neuron. Neuron is the one that performs

25:12.880 --> 25:20.400
primary function. Schwann cell just helps it to perform it better. There are neurons without

25:20.400 --> 25:24.240
Schwann cells. There are no Schwann cells without neurons. Schwann cell doesn't have meaning outside

25:24.240 --> 25:29.840
of the neuron. It's like a gold player and caddy. We can play both without a caddy, but caddy without

25:29.840 --> 25:35.920
a gold player makes no sense. And that's what how some cells are, a pericyte and the trivial cell,

25:35.920 --> 25:41.520
the same example and so forth. So there are many cell types, particularly in more complex

25:41.600 --> 25:46.960
metazones, that are of this type where they perform supportive functions,

25:47.840 --> 25:52.240
and then other cell types perform primary functions. So here we have, again, a relation.

25:53.200 --> 26:06.640
It's like somebody who has, let's say, servants, like cooks and drivers, cleaners.

26:07.600 --> 26:13.840
There is that type of relation. So what happens is that the driver, cleaner and cook, in this case,

26:13.840 --> 26:19.680
are defined by their relation to whoever they serve. And what that also illustrates is the way

26:19.680 --> 26:26.800
that this type of relation evolves is that when this cell type gets more and more specialized on

26:26.800 --> 26:32.800
a particular function, what it means that when you specialize on something, it means you do

26:33.760 --> 26:39.360
fewer things better and better, right? Fewer and fewer things better and better. If you are like a

26:40.080 --> 26:48.080
famous, whatever, piano player and you don't have time to clean and shop and do chores,

26:48.080 --> 26:52.080
you hire people who do that for you. But what it means you delegate some of the functions

26:53.360 --> 26:58.480
to supporting staff, supporting cells. So neuron delegates a lot of functions to

26:58.480 --> 27:03.040
bleed your cells, for example. And the same is true for all the other primary cell types.

27:04.240 --> 27:07.760
They can be bothered to perform the same functions if you expect them to be

27:10.800 --> 27:16.160
optimal at performing one function. That's what happens with humans. Also, of course, we get

27:16.160 --> 27:24.640
progressively more specialized. And in the process of that, we delegate some of the functions to

27:24.640 --> 27:28.320
other cells. And that in itself raises an interesting question. What can you delegate?

27:30.400 --> 27:36.160
So, obviously, you can delegate functions that are not cell autonomous, but you cannot

27:36.160 --> 27:42.560
delegate cell autonomous functions. You can delegate cooking to somebody you hire to cook for

27:42.560 --> 27:48.240
you, but you cannot delegate eating, right? So certain types of functions are delegated and

27:48.240 --> 27:53.600
these are non cell autonomous functions. And the genes that perform these functions can now

27:53.600 --> 27:57.920
be expressed in cells that are supporting the performance support function. And that's what

27:57.920 --> 28:03.680
seen in gene expression profiles and tissue specific characteristics of cells that are

28:03.680 --> 28:10.160
ubiquitous in tissues like macrophages and so forth. So these are some other examples. I'm not

28:10.160 --> 28:14.480
going to go through all of them, but these are some other examples of cell relations

28:16.240 --> 28:22.400
that we can think of. This can be already mentioned, instructive relation, functional

28:22.400 --> 28:29.200
relations, then there could be supply consumer relation, hierarchical relations, and there

28:29.200 --> 28:35.440
could be also relations based on mutual exclusivity. For example, if cell A is present somewhere,

28:35.440 --> 28:42.400
it's never in a company of cell B. These are mutually excluded. We don't know, I mean,

28:42.400 --> 28:49.840
the examples like this exist, but we don't know if these are, they need to be defined in a more

28:49.840 --> 28:57.520
strict way. This is more for, for illustration purposes here. Okay, so from here, we can now

28:57.520 --> 29:04.160
go back to this picture we had before. And now we can look at a very different light. We can say,

29:04.160 --> 29:10.960
okay, what do we have here? We have these various types of cells. They're not all equally important

29:10.960 --> 29:15.600
because you can remove some of the cells and tissue will retain its architecture. You can

29:15.680 --> 29:20.720
remove T cells and you lose some functionalities, but you still have the same tissue architecture.

29:20.720 --> 29:27.840
You remove fibroglas and it collapses. So they are unequal in that regard. And what that means

29:27.840 --> 29:32.480
is that some cells are more important than others for tissue architecture. They all have

29:32.480 --> 29:36.560
their distinct functionalities, but in terms of tissue architecture, they are not equal.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.440
And that raises the question, which ones are the most important ones? And so we can also now

29:43.440 --> 29:47.680
look at it from the perspective in structural relations, functional relations, and so on. So

29:47.680 --> 29:55.200
now instead of being concerned with cell shapes and whatever, transcriptomics, proteomics, these

29:55.200 --> 30:02.000
sort of things, we can label them as different, different categories and the patterns would

30:02.000 --> 30:07.680
start emerging, right? And so if you imagine them just as little circles, it is different colors.

30:08.240 --> 30:13.920
And we defined relations between colors. So the colors will represent categories.

30:15.520 --> 30:23.040
And so if we start thinking about what are the most fundamental categories and what are the most

30:24.000 --> 30:28.400
important, important cell types for tissue architecture, for organization of tissues,

30:28.400 --> 30:34.560
not for functionalities, for organization of tissues. As I mentioned in the very beginning

30:34.560 --> 30:41.120
of MetaZone Life, it was a bacterial mesenchymal unit with the basement membrane in between,

30:41.120 --> 30:47.040
and that's what led to the diversification of various types of organization. In vertebrates,

30:47.040 --> 30:52.480
I think we have a minimal tissue unit that is based on that original theme,

30:53.360 --> 31:00.800
and that minimal unit consists of four types of cells or four categories. Three of them correspond

31:00.880 --> 31:08.000
to types usually for most organs, but these are categories. So we have a category of a tissue

31:08.000 --> 31:13.840
specific cell that is responsible for core tissue function. This is the cell type responsible for

31:13.840 --> 31:19.840
the primary function of the tissue. In the brain, it would be neuron, in the gut, it would be gut

31:19.840 --> 31:26.640
epithelium, and so forth. And then we always have three additional cell types that are nearly

31:26.720 --> 31:31.680
universally present in all tissues, and that includes, of course, microvascular endothelium.

31:32.480 --> 31:38.240
It includes stromal cell, fibroblast-like cells, and it includes tissue resin macrophage.

31:38.880 --> 31:45.200
So these three correspond to cell types performing supportive functions. So now we define this

31:45.200 --> 31:51.200
minimal unit based on relation between these supportive cell types that are universal in

31:51.200 --> 31:57.040
every tissue and tissue-specific primary cell type that obviously perform these different

31:57.040 --> 32:03.600
different tissues because it performs tissue-specific primary functions. Now in the gut, we have,

32:03.600 --> 32:08.000
let's say, intestinal epithelium, then we have these three cell types. They are not involved in the

32:08.000 --> 32:12.560
primary function of the gut, which is digestion absorption, but without these cell types, of

32:12.560 --> 32:18.640
course, epithelial cells cannot perform that function. In the brain, we have neurons and

32:18.640 --> 32:23.680
glial cells, the same idea. So these supportive cell types are always there to

32:26.560 --> 32:32.720
support the function of the client cell. So we can call this a client cell by analogy with

32:32.720 --> 32:39.280
chaperones. And so then what we have is that client cells delegate some of the functions to

32:39.280 --> 32:44.720
supportive cell types, and some delegated functions need to be performed all the time

32:44.720 --> 32:51.120
constitutionally, and this become tissue-resident cells. But some functions only need to be performed

32:51.120 --> 32:58.480
on demand. And these are delegated to cells that are not resident in the tissue, but can be recruited

32:58.480 --> 33:05.200
to the tissue. And this is the case for vertebrates, or any animal is plus circulation. And that would

33:05.200 --> 33:10.400
be the case of inflammatory cells. So neutrophils, you only need them when there is an infection,

33:11.360 --> 33:16.000
whereas macrophage, you need in tissue all the time, because macrophages have many jobs.

33:16.000 --> 33:21.280
They're like butlers. They can do a lot of things. But when there is a really big problem,

33:21.280 --> 33:29.360
you need specialists, and there would be neutrophils. And so then we can think of the way that the

33:29.360 --> 33:36.080
biological development of tissue architecture goes from this base case, which is what the

33:36.080 --> 33:43.040
beginning of animal life history, as well as the beginning of any animal during development,

33:43.040 --> 33:49.280
embryonic development, starts with a pithelium, then generate mesenchymal by EMT, and then from

33:49.280 --> 33:54.960
there you go through this process of instructive relations and generate all kinds of tissues.

33:54.960 --> 34:02.320
But the derived case that is universal theme now for vertebrate architecture organization,

34:02.320 --> 34:06.320
this is only talking about compositional organization, not spatial organization.

34:07.200 --> 34:12.640
The general theme would be that you always have the primary cell type, which is the primary

34:12.640 --> 34:19.200
function of tissue, it's tissue specific and three supportive cell types. And that's what we can think

34:19.200 --> 34:29.840
of as a first approximation. This is of course in very broad strokes. And this is only thinking

34:29.840 --> 34:35.920
about the compositional organization of tissue, not structural. But even from that perspective,

34:35.920 --> 34:43.280
there are many deep questions one can ask. We don't know the answers to most of them,

34:43.280 --> 34:51.360
but mostly I would say because the questions have not been asked that way. So one has to do with

34:51.360 --> 35:00.400
one of my big interests for me is understanding biology of cell communication and particularly

35:00.400 --> 35:08.960
biology of growth act. So every cell in the animal, every normal cell that is not cancerous cell

35:09.600 --> 35:14.880
requires specific growth factors to stay alive and to be present in the tissue.

35:15.280 --> 35:21.520
The cells that don't have their specific growth factor will die by default. So cell composition

35:21.520 --> 35:27.680
of tissue is dictated by local availability of these linear restricted growth factors for macrophage

35:27.680 --> 35:35.600
to be CSF1 from fibroblast PDG of beta and so forth. In the telial cells, whether they're

35:35.600 --> 35:40.240
GMF and other angiogenic factors, and the cell will have different growth factors depending

35:40.240 --> 35:47.120
on what the identity is. So then the question becomes that the cell composition, because it's

35:47.120 --> 35:55.920
a function of local availability of specific growth factors, what kind of cell in what amounts,

35:55.920 --> 36:02.720
in what location you will have in the tissue is entirely dictated by local provisional growth

36:02.720 --> 36:08.720
factor in particular place in particular amounts. So then the question then becomes what are the

36:08.720 --> 36:14.240
rules and mechanisms that ensure production of appropriate growth factors in the right amounts

36:14.240 --> 36:20.160
in the right places. And that, because we don't know those rules, I think that that provides a

36:20.160 --> 36:28.160
major, major conceptual gap in our understanding of development and tissue biology. So we're

36:28.160 --> 36:34.880
interested in this question and this is of course, this is not one set of rule, it needs a systematic

36:34.880 --> 36:41.440
study and of course in the lab we can only do, you know, proof of concept studies. So the question

36:41.440 --> 36:47.200
is as follows. So the growth factors of that type, the type that are called linear restricted

36:47.200 --> 36:54.160
growth factors that are necessary for each cell to survive. Production of these growth factors is

36:54.160 --> 37:01.760
typically the source of them is another cell type. If this is growth factor for cell Y,

37:02.320 --> 37:07.840
it's typically produced by cell X, which is a different cell type. So cell X makes growth

37:07.840 --> 37:13.040
factor for cell Y and the amount of that growth factor determines the number of cell Y is where

37:13.040 --> 37:19.680
they are location, because these growth factors typically have small diffusion radius, and they

37:19.680 --> 37:26.800
are often deposited on ECM. And then question becomes how does these cells, cell X knows which

37:26.880 --> 37:32.400
growth factor to make and how much to make. Okay, we can say well, which growth factor to make

37:32.400 --> 37:39.040
could be hard wires, it could be part of the identity that if you sell X, you program to make

37:39.040 --> 37:45.440
growth factor for cell Y, that's fair assumption. And there are cases when it is indeed the case

37:46.080 --> 37:51.840
that it's produces, it's already knows which growth factor to make. In other cases, it needs to be

37:51.840 --> 38:00.800
told. And it can be told by cell Y itself. Cell Y tells it that I need, my identity is Y, and I

38:00.800 --> 38:07.360
need growth factor that supports cell Y. And what that communication is like, that's the part that

38:07.360 --> 38:12.480
we also interested in understanding, and we still don't know all the details, but we know that there

38:12.480 --> 38:19.600
is indeed this type of communication. So the question is what determines this, this

38:22.080 --> 38:26.320
controls the appropriate production level. And I'll go through this example very quickly,

38:26.320 --> 38:33.360
because it was published, but we use microphase fibroblasts as a case study to as a proof of

38:33.360 --> 38:39.760
concept study to characterize in exchange of these two growth factors, which are well defined for

38:39.760 --> 38:45.520
these cells, it's CSF1 for macrophage produced by fibroblasts and PDGF for fibroblasts produced by

38:45.520 --> 38:51.920
macrophage. And what we found in that study a few years ago is that if we define conditions such that

38:51.920 --> 38:59.440
if you take individually the cell type, and don't provide exogenous recombinant growth factors,

38:59.440 --> 39:03.680
they will die as expected, each of them will die. But because they can each produce growth

39:03.680 --> 39:08.480
factor for the other guy, we ask whether they can support each other under those conditions where

39:08.480 --> 39:14.000
there is no external growth factor. And they can indeed, and not only that, they could also

39:14.000 --> 39:23.120
reach stable ratio, even if we vary initial ratio by hundredfold, they all convert to stable ratio,

39:23.120 --> 39:29.600
which implies that they're not simply feeding each other growth factor that would lead to

39:29.600 --> 39:36.560
uncontrolled growth, but rather there is some kind of a circuit design of the exchange of growth

39:36.640 --> 39:43.200
factors that results in stability. And indeed, there is a circuit design that results in stability,

39:43.200 --> 39:47.440
and it's shown here. So that's what we found both experimentally and through modeling,

39:48.320 --> 39:54.800
that the for the two cell types to be stable, one has to be limited by carrying capacity, which is

39:55.680 --> 40:01.680
limitation external to the system, just like in ecology, carrying capacity, space, food, and so

40:02.640 --> 40:07.360
on. And the other cell type has to be limited, it has to have a negative feedback on a growth

40:07.360 --> 40:12.080
factor it receives from the first cell type. And as long as these two conditions are met,

40:13.280 --> 40:19.120
you can, you will have a stable system. But these conditions are met only in 24 out of

40:19.120 --> 40:27.520
144 total cases of total number of possible cell circuit topologies. Of them only 24 are

40:27.520 --> 40:33.440
stable, and all of them have these two conditions met. And this is what it would look like if X1

40:33.440 --> 40:38.880
is here would be fibroblast X2 macrophage, this is a phase portrait of the dynamic behavior,

40:38.880 --> 40:44.800
we have the same experimental data. And this is the predicted on state, which is what we observe.

40:45.600 --> 40:51.440
And as you can see, the system will evolve towards the stable on state, and this is stable

40:51.440 --> 40:56.720
off state when there are no cells. But what was interesting in this case, it also, we also found

40:56.720 --> 41:03.360
additional on state, stable on state for one cell type for fibroblast, but only when the density

41:03.360 --> 41:09.520
of the cell was above some threshold. And in ecology, this type of phenomenon is known as

41:09.520 --> 41:21.520
Ali effect. Ali effect means that population will undergo expansion, only if it is above

41:21.520 --> 41:27.040
some critical density. So for example, and for penguins, they cannot survive in the

41:28.960 --> 41:35.760
wild if there is not enough of them, because they need to huddle to keep each other warm.

41:35.760 --> 41:40.160
Pack of wolves, one wolf would not survive because they hunt in packs and things like that.

41:40.160 --> 41:46.240
So this is Ali effect. And we see that there is Ali effect in cell ecology as well. And specifically

41:46.240 --> 41:51.840
for fibroblasts, it requires if they reach critical density, they now can support each

41:51.840 --> 41:57.040
other without macrophage. And the reason for that is this autographed signal. And that signal is

41:57.040 --> 42:05.360
provided by PTGF alpha and HBGF. And so that that's what type of scenarios we see that for

42:05.360 --> 42:10.800
this is stable observed state. With autographed signal, you have this additional stable state

42:10.800 --> 42:15.680
that could be pathological because when you have fibroblasts without macrophage, this is basically

42:15.680 --> 42:22.320
the case of fibrosis. So this type of circuit design creates vulnerability for fibrosis.

42:23.360 --> 42:28.880
But then there are other designs that we find through computationally, and they presumably

42:28.880 --> 42:37.840
exist also amongst cell-cell interactions. In this case, if you don't have autographed signal,

42:37.840 --> 42:46.720
you don't have this pathological stable state with cell X1 alone. But on the other hand,

42:46.720 --> 42:53.600
so these type of tissues that have the cells with this circuit of interaction will not be

42:54.480 --> 42:59.520
vulnerable to fibrosis. But on the other hand, the basin of attraction to the off state is much

42:59.520 --> 43:05.040
bigger here, which may suggest that these type of tissues will be vulnerable to degenerative

43:05.040 --> 43:11.520
disease instead of fibroly disease. And this is something that we're still exploring. That's

43:11.520 --> 43:18.960
indeed the case. So from that, what we find is that there is this relation between cells

43:19.920 --> 43:24.400
based on growth factor production that is dictated by critical growth factor topology

43:25.120 --> 43:34.000
and that there is a simple requirement for stability that we can define and that this

43:34.000 --> 43:41.280
can be generalized to other types of interactions where it's the same topology doesn't. And from that

43:41.280 --> 43:52.240
we then wanted to ask the next question, what controls the size of the compartments and tissues?

43:54.080 --> 43:59.760
And there are two paradigms that existed side by side for decades. One paradigm for

43:59.840 --> 44:05.760
compartmental size control is basically space availability. And that cells, if they have cells

44:05.760 --> 44:11.680
to expand to, they will expand. When they don't have space to expand to, they stop expanding.

44:11.680 --> 44:17.440
This is contact inhibition in vitro. But in vivo, this would apply to cells that use

44:17.440 --> 44:23.280
mechanosensing, for example, to determine when they have to stop dividing. And this type of

44:23.280 --> 44:28.880
mechanosensing, for example, famously operates through the hippo pathway. And that paradigm works

44:29.440 --> 44:35.360
for these types of tissues. But it would not be applicable to tissues that are not limited by

44:35.360 --> 44:41.360
space, like macrophages lymphocytes and a hematopoietic cell. So then the question is what

44:41.360 --> 44:46.640
control this compartment size? And that's where second paradigm is applicable. And that is that

44:47.840 --> 44:54.160
every cell needs growth active to survive and to proliferate. And if you fix the amount of

44:54.160 --> 45:00.240
growth factor to the appropriate level, the cells will expand if there is more growth factor than

45:00.240 --> 45:06.240
the cells that it can support. But once they reach that level, further expansion will result

45:06.240 --> 45:11.920
cells that now don't have enough growth factor and they will die. And so it's above that level.

45:12.640 --> 45:16.880
It will go down. If it's below that level, they will expand. And that's how you can, and that

45:18.000 --> 45:24.000
clearly that's how it works for hematopoietic cells. That's well known. You can change the amount

45:24.000 --> 45:30.560
of retropoietin, for example, or GCSF while seven and you can control different hematopoietic

45:30.560 --> 45:37.040
cell size numbers. But what was striking for us is that these two paradigms applied exactly to the

45:37.040 --> 45:46.000
two cell types that we use in our study. And again, if we think from the cell category perspective,

45:46.800 --> 45:54.640
we have one category of cell that is limited by one population size control paradigm.

45:55.520 --> 46:00.960
And the other cell type that's controlled by another paradigm. And we asked whether this is

46:00.960 --> 46:07.120
just purely a lucky coincidence or curious coincidence or if there is some deeper inside

46:07.120 --> 46:14.160
here. And specifically, we asked whether, because fibroblast controlled by space availability,

46:14.160 --> 46:18.880
so carrying capacity of the environment and microphase by growth factor availability, we asked

46:18.880 --> 46:24.880
whether production of growth factor by fibroblast is a function of space availability it can detect.

46:25.680 --> 46:30.720
And that's exactly what we found that we, when we looked at fibroblasts growing them at different

46:30.720 --> 46:36.640
densities as to mimic space availability, we find there's a number of genes that control

46:36.640 --> 46:43.280
in density dependent manner and amongst them growth factors like CSF1 and many others.

46:44.640 --> 46:50.400
And so that indicated that CSF1, for example, would be expressed at higher level when cells are at

46:51.040 --> 46:56.640
lower density. And as density increases, it will be at lower level. And this way you adjust the

46:56.640 --> 47:02.560
numbers of fibroblasts dictated by space availability to the number of macrophages dictated by CSF1

47:02.560 --> 47:08.240
availability that they produce as a function of space. I have a quick question. Sorry to interrupt

47:08.240 --> 47:15.520
you, but so I know that the ECM plays a large role in growth factor availability. It acts like a

47:15.520 --> 47:22.720
sink. It acts as like a release factor. Have you looked at all at, because in cell density, you

47:22.720 --> 47:29.360
start to build up a certain amount of ECM as well as the number of cells. Have you looked at whether

47:29.360 --> 47:34.960
or not if you co-template with the ECM that these cells would normally lay down,

47:34.960 --> 47:37.440
if that would have the same effect as the cell density?

47:38.880 --> 47:46.080
Yes, we have. The answer is a bit more kind of involved to you. It's a very important question

47:46.080 --> 47:54.160
and we're really interested in understanding how ECM contributes to that. We know that it's a little

47:54.160 --> 48:02.800
bit, it will take us a bit far from the main topic here, but what we know is that in the case of

48:02.800 --> 48:11.120
macrophage and fibroblast interaction, the exchange of growth factors is cell contact dependent. Moreover,

48:12.320 --> 48:19.200
fibroblasts that receive PDGF from macrophage will only receive PDGF from macrophage if it

48:19.280 --> 48:27.040
provides that macrophage with CSF1. If we remove CSF1 from half of fibroblasts, mix them with the

48:27.040 --> 48:33.600
well-typed ones, give them macrophages in the same system I described. Fibroblasts that don't

48:33.600 --> 48:39.920
contribute growth factor do not receive growth factor. It operates in a cell. It's like a

48:41.760 --> 48:47.200
gangster movies where you give the drug and the case with drug and case with money and you exchange

48:47.200 --> 48:54.480
it like this and you don't just give and trust the other one. It's some kind of a maybe anti-cheater

48:55.200 --> 49:01.680
strategy, but it is a direct exchange in these things. There are some other interesting, very

49:01.680 --> 49:09.120
interesting scenarios, as you mentioned, because there is a form of CSF1 that is proteoglycan form,

49:10.000 --> 49:19.120
but in this case it wasn't a factor. We tried to simplify to look at, with a minimal number of

49:19.120 --> 49:25.200
variables, but it is a very important point. There is a mechanosensing by both fibroblasts

49:25.200 --> 49:31.200
and macrophages also, a thing that I'm not going to discuss, where we find that macrophages use

49:31.200 --> 49:37.600
very fundamentally different mechanosensing strategy compared to fibroblasts or bacterial cells.

49:40.000 --> 49:46.560
Sorry, so just to finish this quickly, this part, what we find is that there is a

49:48.000 --> 49:54.160
density sensitive enhancer in fibroblasts that controls expression CSF1.

49:54.880 --> 50:01.920
And when we perform motif enrichment analysis, we found that that sites were enriched in density

50:01.920 --> 50:06.560
sensitive genes and that is DNA binding transcription factor controlled by hippo pathway.

50:07.040 --> 50:12.080
And basically we found that hippo pathway controls, through this distant enhancer,

50:12.080 --> 50:18.640
controls expression of CSF1 and fibroblasts, but not in other cell types. These enhancers

50:18.640 --> 50:24.000
are only active in fibroblasts, and that one indeed is recruited there, it's shown here by

50:24.720 --> 50:30.160
chromatin IP, and that's what controls expression of CSF1, leading to this kind of model, where we

50:30.160 --> 50:39.120
have homeostatic or density sensitive enhancer in CSF1 gene that is operative in fibroblasts,

50:39.760 --> 50:47.040
and it controls homeostatic expression of CSF1, where it adjusts the number of macrophages to

50:47.040 --> 50:56.960
number of fibroblasts. What the parameter for the ratio, this is exactly the kind of characteristics

50:56.960 --> 51:02.080
that would be dependent on the tissue and properties of ECM and so on. That's where the

51:02.080 --> 51:07.280
tuning of this parameter will change this ratio in a tissue specific way, because not every tissue

51:07.280 --> 51:13.440
has exact same ratio and doesn't need to or should not have. And then there is this,

51:14.640 --> 51:20.560
the inducible enhancer, and that could be dependent on the last expansion of macphage on

51:20.560 --> 51:27.280
DMET during infection inflammation and so on. So that's the picture we see with

51:29.840 --> 51:36.320
this type of relation of macrophage in fibroblasts establishing appropriate cell numbers,

51:37.120 --> 51:45.040
and of course this is just one of the principles. There are many additional, as mentioned, ECM,

51:45.040 --> 51:51.200
how they both sense ECM and whether signals is delivered through cell contact, through diffusion,

51:51.200 --> 51:56.000
or through deposition on ECM. These will provide important variations on the theme,

51:56.720 --> 52:03.280
which need to be individually explored. But what I want to finish here is the notion that there is

52:04.320 --> 52:11.840
how this can be generalized, where we have a cell type, for example, fibroblast that senses

52:12.400 --> 52:19.440
some aspect of tissue environment, for example, space. That space sensing is coupled, in this case,

52:19.440 --> 52:23.600
through hippo pathway, coupled with control of growth factor for another cell type.

52:24.720 --> 52:32.320
And because space availability cell numbers, these are characteristics of tissue homoesthetic

52:32.320 --> 52:39.520
variables, here we just have this simple type of relation unrelated to function, because space

52:40.480 --> 52:45.440
availability is not related to function of macrophage. But then we have other types of

52:45.440 --> 52:51.680
relations where it is related to function. So, for example, sensing oxygen availability in other

52:52.400 --> 52:58.720
environmental factor in tissues now sends through heat one pathway, and negatively regulates

52:58.720 --> 53:04.000
expression of that gap, which is a growth factor for endothelial cell. Now, endothelial cell

53:04.000 --> 53:09.920
functionally is related to oxygen availability. So, if oxygen level is low, if derepressed,

53:10.560 --> 53:18.080
undiogenesis occurs, oxygen delivered, and oxygen level goes back to normal. And that type of relation

53:18.080 --> 53:25.200
now can be expanded as I will elaborate in the next slide. But there are additional types,

53:25.200 --> 53:31.040
so this raises the question of what are aspects of tissue environment that are sense, all the aspects

53:31.040 --> 53:37.600
of tissue environment that are sense in a way that translates into control of specific growth

53:37.600 --> 53:45.440
factor production. And how that, because each growth factor controls specific cell types,

53:46.320 --> 53:53.600
how the cell type is related to this factor that is sensed, that controls production.

53:53.600 --> 53:59.520
And that, I think, what defines the rules. It's one set of rules, it's not all rules,

53:59.520 --> 54:03.280
but it's one set of rules that defines how growth factor expression is regulated.

54:04.240 --> 54:11.200
So, here we have the homeostatic control, which is unrelated to this functional role of the cells.

54:11.200 --> 54:15.360
It's just, it's calibrated. You always need enough macrophages. So, it's calibrated on the

54:15.360 --> 54:21.200
pollution time scale. You always need this many, you know, this ratio, this percentage of macrophages.

54:22.160 --> 54:27.120
But then, in addition, you can have expansion on demand. If there's infection need more macrophages,

54:27.120 --> 54:32.880
so this growth factor will go up. If you have hypoxia, you will need more endothelial cells,

54:32.880 --> 54:39.440
this growth factor will go up. If there is this X, some other environmental factor of tissue,

54:39.440 --> 54:45.680
you need more of cell X, and you produce growth factor for cell X. And then, when we looked at

54:48.480 --> 54:54.000
imposing different kind of perturbations on cell to mimic these deviations in tissue environment.

54:54.000 --> 55:01.280
So, we used hypoxia, glucose deprivation, I mean acid deprivation, ER stress, osmotic stress,

55:01.280 --> 55:07.760
and so forth, oxidative stress. And then, looked at the expression of genes and fibrolysis, and we

55:07.760 --> 55:15.440
find a whole range of growth factors are regulated by these perturbations, which brings up the

55:15.440 --> 55:21.360
possibility of exploring what the logic is in each individual case, because for each growth factor,

55:21.360 --> 55:26.160
there is a corresponding cell type that's controlled by it. Often, for even perturbation,

55:26.160 --> 55:31.200
you will need more than one cell type, of course, and that's why you will see that some of them induce

55:32.640 --> 55:37.200
most of them induce more than one growth factor. So, sensing of the environment by one cell type

55:37.200 --> 55:42.560
is linked to control population size of another cell type that is functionally related to whatever

55:42.560 --> 55:49.200
that environmental perturbation reflects. And so, to generalize this, we can say it acts as

55:49.200 --> 55:55.360
anything that determines the requirement for Y. Let's say there is a lot of, I don't know,

55:55.360 --> 56:01.600
garbage, you need more genitors, right? And then you have a sensor that determines that there is

56:01.600 --> 56:07.920
a lot of garbage. So, that would be the cell that determines that X is there, and therefore,

56:07.920 --> 56:14.000
you need Y to take care of X. If it's hypoxia, you need endothelial smells. If it's infection,

56:14.080 --> 56:23.280
you need neutrophil. If it's some kind of other type of perturbation, you need a particular

56:23.280 --> 56:30.960
cell type. And then, the way that it operates is what I call functional demand. So, in this case,

56:30.960 --> 56:38.960
what the underlying logic is that if X is detected, that means there is a demand for the function of

56:38.960 --> 56:46.320
the cell Y that can take care of X. So, this is a sensing of functional demand

56:47.280 --> 56:53.680
by cell X. So, it sends demand for function of cell Y, produces growth factor for cell Y,

56:53.680 --> 56:59.520
cell Y expands, performs the function, functional demand is eliminated, and it goes back to steady

56:59.520 --> 57:07.440
state. And in this fashion, cell X knows which growth factor to make. Remember the question of

57:07.440 --> 57:11.840
identity, how do cells know which growth factor? It knows which growth factor, and it knows how

57:11.840 --> 57:17.680
much to make. It depends on how much of functional demand there is. And it doesn't have to be only

57:17.680 --> 57:24.400
growth factor. It could be any signal that can fulfill this circuit. It could be an expansion

57:24.400 --> 57:29.840
of the cells, but it could also be a recruitment, or it could be activation of the function Y

57:29.840 --> 57:35.680
that will remove that demand. And that now goes to a more general type of control circuits that

57:35.680 --> 57:41.040
operate also in physiological settings and so forth. But for growth factor production, I think

57:41.040 --> 57:51.280
that's what determines their functionality. Okay, so I will, instead of continuing in the same way,

57:51.280 --> 57:56.160
in what I will do, I wanted to finish with something very different, not different, but

57:56.720 --> 58:06.000
with notions related to what I started with, thinking about what I talked about most of my

58:06.000 --> 58:13.840
talk is about examples of approaching these questions of tissue, social organization of tissues,

58:14.880 --> 58:20.320
social lives of cells from the perspective of trying to look for underlying principles and rules.

58:21.120 --> 58:27.520
And of course, as you all know, this is the general sort of strategy and general

58:27.520 --> 58:33.920
paradigm and complex systems where you have multiple agents that interact with each other,

58:34.480 --> 58:40.720
according to some rules, and that generates, generates, there is

58:41.600 --> 58:50.160
emerging properties that are consequences of these interactions. And of course,

58:50.160 --> 58:54.640
then the pictures like this that are emerging properties of interactions from agents,

58:54.640 --> 59:04.400
patient or births, these are the observables. And the observables often fascinating, but

59:04.400 --> 59:09.600
understanding them from the perspective that would be the first instinct to understand them,

59:09.600 --> 59:14.480
to describe the size, the number of fish and what they're thinking, what they, you know,

59:14.480 --> 59:20.640
what their glucose level is, measuring their RNA expression levels and proteomics and so forth.

59:21.680 --> 59:27.120
These are going to be totally useless to understanding how you form this type of structures.

59:28.240 --> 59:32.880
And instead, we need to understand what are the rules that generated them.

59:33.840 --> 59:39.680
But again, what we're dealing with is these observables. And I made this very kind of a toy

59:39.680 --> 59:46.640
example to illustrate something that I think for you would be very familiar intellectually,

59:47.440 --> 59:53.600
that let's say this is the observable, this is what you see in microscope or through some other

59:53.600 --> 01:00:00.240
type of experiment. And you try to understand how is this generated. This is some kind of a

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:06.240
structure you see it could be some arrangement of cells in the tissue or whatnot. And of course,

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:11.840
this would be very misleading if you tried to kind of use your immediate instinct to think that

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:21.360
there is something that generated curve structure. Right. Then if we know that actually, it's part

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:27.040
of this structure is just that you can see there are four repeated units and three of them are

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:34.320
black. And you cannot see them, or three of them are made up by cells that died in the as a part of

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:41.840
the developmental program. And you left only with this one on the left. And but in reality,

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.640
it's actually symmetrical structure. Not only it's curved by cement, but it's still curved. So

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:51.840
you're still thinking, well, how do you generate curve structure? And then we add mask, additional

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:57.120
layer. And now we look here. And now we see that these are actually

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:06.320
curve structure. Now we the white stripes become visible. And once they are visible, now we see,

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:14.400
oh, this is just slightly skewed hexagon. And we know exactly how to make a hexagon. And this is

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:23.520
just one line of code to say, you know, draw hexagon and instead of instead of 120 degrees,

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:30.240
you turn by 121 degrees. And now it's slightly skewed, and you iterate that and you get curve

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:36.160
structure. And if you remove some parts of it and end up with what's on the left, then there is no

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:42.720
way to tell how you made it. So the point being that the rule to generate this is very simple rule.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:50.640
Just drawing hexagon and slightly skewing the angle. As a result, you have this spiral

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.760
lock structures, then you remove parts of them and you can have a curve. And if you look at the

01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:02.960
curve, there's it's very hard to tell if not impossible to tell how it was generated. And

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:11.680
so what we deal with often is these observables, which which are several steps removed from the

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:18.640
rules that generated them. The rules themselves are extremely simple. But the observable, the curve

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:23.920
is emergent property here, usually, but how it generates them. And we can see that more clearly

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.400
with some cell automata types of examples, where you look at this final structure here,

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:34.720
and you try to understand how it was generated. It's hard to tell by looking at it, but that's

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:41.520
the observable. Now, if you look at it carefully, you start seeing, well, there is some symmetry here.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:48.320
And if you look at symmetry, you apply coarse-graining and see that, well, this unit

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:53.200
actually repeated four times this one. In this unit, you also start seeing symmetry. It's also

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:58.400
repeated four times in this structure, then it's repeated four times in this structure. And that

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:04.720
is generated by these types of rules. So these are two rules. I mean, these are completely randomly

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.360
chosen just for illustration purposes to say that these are the rules that generate this.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:17.600
The way they generate is through iteration and based on local information only and based on

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:23.680
only information available at the time of execution of the rules. You don't need to have

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:28.720
memory. You don't need to have global information. But the point is that if we know the rules,

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.320
of course, we can generate easily these structures. And we understand them completely when we know

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.040
the rules. But if you go the other way, which is the way we're usually forced to go because

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:44.160
what's observable is going from the other end, we have this structure. We try to understand the rule

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:54.560
and we can't because we don't know. There are no universal methods to do so. So we have to,

01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:00.160
instead of characterizing more and more detail, what that is, we try to figure out what are the

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.760
original structures that generated them. And this is what basically

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:12.400
point that what we need to understand is what are the rules of interaction.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:20.720
And of course, then there are many fascinating questions about specific mechanisms, pathways

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:28.400
and so forth. But if we simplify it down to the bare minimum, if you think about what cells can do,

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:36.320
cells can do five things. They can do nothing. So that's an identity operation. They can die,

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:43.200
they can copy, they can change identity, and they can change location. I'm sorry,

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:48.240
set identity twice, I meant it in different ways. This is cell identity and this is identity

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:56.480
operation, meaning that it's a, it's unity. It's doing nothing. So these are five things

01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:01.520
that cells can do. There's nothing else. Everything is variation on these five things. Of course,

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:09.520
most variations comes from changing identity, which is cell state, cell type, and so forth.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:18.000
But ultimately, this is, everything is a combination of these five actions. And this first action,

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:25.600
do nothing, is also an active action because you don't just stay as you are. You often, well,

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:31.840
a cell always needs a signal that tells it to stay as you are. Don't die, don't proliferate,

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:37.920
don't move. It's also an active process. So for each of these, there is a corresponding

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:45.360
types of signals that tell them do A, B, C, D, or E. And so now if you think of all the language

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:53.680
of cell communication, all the words that cells can hear and utter, all of them, we can say, can

01:05:54.880 --> 01:06:03.520
fall into five categories, whether they tell cells to do A, B, C, D, or E. And that is sort

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:12.560
of the direction we are going in our thinking of defining the language based on, of course,

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:18.000
the interpretation of different signals also depends on the function of the state. It's not

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:24.400
just that a particular biochemical signal always means A or B. It also depends on cell state,

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:30.560
just like in any communication. And those are the very basic and general sort of description of

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:42.400
the types of rules we are seeking to find. So I'll stop here and take any questions. Thank you.
