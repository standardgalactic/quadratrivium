1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So thanks everybody for being here and letting me share some some ideas with you. If anybody's

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,360
interested in the details of it, you can track them down at this website. Here's all the papers,

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,680
the software, the data sets, everything. Here is where I put some more speculative kinds of things

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,160
where I talk about what I think the papers mean and so on. So you're welcome to welcome to check

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,080
them out. What I'm going to talk to you about today is kind of a weird topic. I'm going to talk about

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,720
a little bit about AI and the right way to understand AI through the lens of collective

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,880
intelligence. In other words, we're going to take a kind of a deep dive into where minds come from

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:47,680
so that we can actually talk about this notion of whether artificial minds have the same status as

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,320
biologically evolved ones and so on. And so we're going to look at those kind of questions.

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:59,680
So the main points of today, what I'd like to do is this. We're going to look under the hood

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,600
of biology a little bit to kind of clear out some viewpoints and some terminology that's

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,040
persisted with us for centuries, basically, but I think are going to have to change and this idea

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,560
of discrete natural kinds in biology. So we'll talk about that. We'll talk about diverse intelligence

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,840
in particular collective intelligence. So very kind of unconventional minds and unconventional

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,880
cognitive systems. And I'm going to argue that all the things that people argue about today in

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,520
terms of artificial intelligence are basically kind of an off ramp to a much deeper, more difficult

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,640
discussion about the really deep philosophical questions about what we are, what about freedom

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,200
of embodiment and things like that. It's actually much more, it's a much more complicated set of

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,280
questions than just to focus on kind of today's AIs. And so we'll talk a little bit at the end

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,760
about the ethics and the future of humanity and things like that. So let's start with this.

21
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,600
This is a well-known painting. It's called Adam Names the Animals in the Garden of Eden.

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,680
Here he is. So this is the old Judeo-Christian story where animals are showing up and Adam

23
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,800
gets to name them. Now, something important about that story is that actually it was on Adam

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,160
to name the animals. God couldn't do it. The angels couldn't do it. Adam was the one that

25
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,080
had to name them. I think that's a very interesting part of that story. And I think for us it has

26
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,160
two lessons. One that we're going to have to break, I think, as the future moves on. And the other

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,880
one that's actually very deep and that we're going to have to dive into. The part that has to be

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,040
given up is this notion that all of these species are discrete. They're natural kinds. Everybody

29
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,080
knows what each of these are. They're separate from the others. In fact, Adam is also a discrete

30
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,760
entity and completely different from all of the others. And this idea that you can sort of

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,560
number and categorize very, very specific types of beings. And that's what they're,

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,800
you can sort of count the animals in your environment. As you'll see in a minute,

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,920
I think that idea has to go. But what's deep is this notion that Adam, because he is the one

34
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,680
that has to live with him, he is the one that has to give them names. Now, in these old traditions,

35
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,000
giving something a name was very deep and spiritual. It meant that you've discovered

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,480
their true nature. Knowing the name of something means you know their true nature. And as I'm

37
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,360
going to show you at the end of this talk, because of synthetic biology and bioengineering and some

38
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,800
other disciplines, we are going to have to name or discover the true nature of all kinds of unusual

39
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,760
creatures that you guys will all be living with in your lifetime. So let's start there. Here's

40
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:49,520
the part that has to break. So here's a normal modern human. Lots of philosophy talks about the

41
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,640
human mind that does this and that and humans have responsibilities and rights and all the

42
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,960
interesting things. But we know that now, because of evolution and also because of developmental

43
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,560
biology, that this is not a sharp category. In other words, if you just track backwards in time,

44
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,680
these modern humans are at a particular point in the evolution of a lineage that goes all the

45
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,720
way back to single cell organisms. So if you have something to say about humans, you might ask yourself,

46
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,160
well, what about the humans of a couple of hundred thousand years ago? What about the hominids of a

47
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,120
couple million years ago? What about them? And just understand that all these changes are slow

48
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,040
and gradual. And the same thing about development. Whatever you think is true of humans with their

49
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:42,880
true hopes and dreams and cognitive responsibilities and so on. At one point, they were a single cell

50
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,240
and this process is again very slow and gradual. And so we know now that there's this continuum,

51
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,280
right? It's not just a discreet human, but actually a whole continuum of forms that you might have

52
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,640
to decide what is the status of these other forms. Not only that, but there's this other continuum

53
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:05,920
going horizontal here in my diagram, where we know that humans are going to be modified and

54
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,960
improved. So for various health applications, but also for augmentation technologies,

55
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,960
there's no particular reason why anybody is going to want to be stuck in the body that random vagaries

56
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,840
of evolution left them with. So, you know, I don't think anybody really thinks that a mature,

57
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,800
modern humanity, you know, a hundred years from now is going to be susceptible to the same dumb

58
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,680
diseases, lower back pain, astigmatism, viruses. You know, presumably all that is going to get

59
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,680
fixed. There's nothing magic about where evolution happened to have dropped us. And so there are

60
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,200
technological modifications. There are biological modifications that will be made. And that's because

61
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,960
at every level of organization in our bodies from subcellular materials all the way up,

62
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,080
you can introduce different kinds of novel engineered components. And so all of this is

63
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,040
now possible. And again, if you have thoughts about what a human is versus what a machine is,

64
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,760
you have to ask yourself, how are you going to distinguish this when you are confronted with

65
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,280
all sorts of beings along this continuum? You know, you're going to need to find ways to relate to

66
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,080
them. And so one of the things that I've been working on for some years now is a framework to

67
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,120
be able to recognize, to create, and to ethically relate to truly diverse intelligences that we

68
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,360
can have relationships with regardless of their composition, meaning what they're made of,

69
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,640
or their origin story, where they evolved, did they come out of a factory or some combination of

70
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,600
those. And that means that we need to think about all of these things. So familiar kinds of creatures

71
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,880
like primates and birds and maybe an octopus and so on. But also all kinds of weird organisms

72
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,720
like colonial organisms, swarms, synthetic engineered new life forms, artificial intelligence

73
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,080
is whether robotic, meaning embodied or pure software AI, and maybe even someday aliens,

74
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,680
right, there's probably some sort of exobiological life form out there somewhere with that at some

75
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,240
point we'll confront. Now, we need to be able to think about all of these in the same way,

76
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,200
regardless of where they came from or what they're made of. Now, I'm not the first person to try for

77
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:14,000
this. So here's Rosenbluth, Wiener and Bigelow in 1943, trying for this scale all the way from

78
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,720
passive matter. So, you know, rocks and sand and things like that, all the way up to different

79
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,080
kinds of active matter, and then various kinds of computational matter, and agential materials,

80
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,560
which is what I'm going to be talking about today, all the way up to some sort of human

81
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,400
metacognition, you know, complex, complex human kinds of minds and beyond. And the goal of this

82
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,600
kind of framework is not just it's not philosophy. The goal is to first of all, move experimental

83
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:46,240
work forward. So, part of my framework is a very strong insistence that when you look at something

84
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,080
and you say that's not real cognition or that, you know, that is real, you know, this thing really

85
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,480
does have intelligence. The goal of this is not just to have philosophical feelings about it,

86
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:04,000
it's to have a toolkit for interacting with these systems that is beneficial, that gives us new,

87
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,680
brings new discoveries, new capabilities, biomedicine, engineering, and so on. And also puts

88
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,000
ethics on a better footing, because these old categories that we've had for a really long time

89
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,240
for how we deal with other beings are really not going to be of use anymore, and the details are

90
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,600
all here if you want to follow that. So, a basic fact from developmental biology is that we all

91
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,000
make this amazing journey from what people call just physics. I really don't like that phrase,

92
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,920
but people use it. So, just physics to a complex mind. So, each of us started life here as a single

93
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:44,160
cell, a little blob of chemicals, and slowly and gradually it became something like this, or even

94
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,720
something like this. So, you know, a complex metacognitive being who's going to say things about

95
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,520
not being a machine and so on. This process is gradual. You need to understand developmental

96
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,960
biology gives us no magic bright line at which point, boom, you know, you were just chemistry

97
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,120
and physics, but bang, there, there, that this is where the mind appears. There isn't anything

98
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,080
like that. It's a very slow and gradual process. And so, what that means is that scientists and

99
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,560
philosophers need to develop a story of scaling. We need to understand how the properties of this

100
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,480
thing, which follows the laws of chemistry and physics, ends up being something that's also

101
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,440
describable by the laws of psychology and psychoanalysis and things like that.

102
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,880
The reason that this is possible is because we are all made of an agential material, unlike legos

103
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,760
and wood and metal and things like that, that basically just stay where you put them. We are

104
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,160
made of a material with agendas. And so, this is the kind of thing we're made of. This is a single

105
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,640
cell, okay? This happens to be a free-living organism called a lacrimaria. You can see that

106
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,600
it's extremely competent in its local unicellular goals. So, there's no brain, there's no nervous

107
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,040
system, there are no stem cells. But this thing is doing everything it needs to maintain its

108
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:04,720
physiological, its metabolic, and behavioral goals. So, the first kind of shocking thing to

109
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:12,320
some people that you need to realize is that we are all made of this interesting kind of

110
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,880
stuff that has its own agendas. I don't have time to tell you about it today, but the reality is

111
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,560
these things, ourselves, can learn. They can actually have pretty complex problem-solving

112
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,600
capacities in different kinds of environments. And so, we are a very interesting construction of a

113
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,680
very unusual type of material with which we are just now starting to learn how to engineer.

114
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,520
But at least, you might think, at least we are a true unified intelligence, right? So,

115
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,960
maybe you can call an ant colony some kind of collective intelligence, but we have a brain

116
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:50,400
where we feel like a single unified being. So, at least we are a true unified intelligence.

117
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:56,400
And in fact, René Descartes really liked the pineal gland because there's only one of them

118
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,600
in the brain. And he thought that that's where the human experience was centralized because

119
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,200
there's no multiple aspects of it, there's just one in the brain. But if he had had access to a

120
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,680
microscope, he would have discovered that inside this pineal gland is all this stuff, it's a bunch

121
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,600
of cells, and inside of each of those cells is all this stuff, okay? There isn't one of anything

122
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,480
in the brain, and all of us are collective intelligences. We are all made of parts that do

123
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,840
things. And the real trick here, again, is that scaling story is to tell a convincing,

124
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,040
to give a convincing account of how it is that all these parts give rise to something that is a

125
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,040
centralized, that has the feeling of being a centralized unified self. And so, this is what

126
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,640
my group works on. Now, it's interesting that Alan Turing, who is basically the father of

127
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:54,000
modern computer science, he was very interested in machine intelligence and in computation and

128
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,200
programmability and things like this. And so, everybody knows that part. But one weird thing

129
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,320
is that he also published this paper called The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, which was

130
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,880
basically an attempt to understand how the chemicals of an embryo organize into order

131
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,560
from their initial disorder. Now, you might wonder why would a guy who's interested in

132
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,640
computation and intelligence and machine minds and things like that, why would he be studying

133
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,320
the chemicals in an embryo? And I think that, although he didn't write about it,

134
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,680
I think that Turing saw a very profound truth, which is that the process by which bodies come

135
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,160
to be in this physical universe, by which your body was self-organized from a bunch of chemicals

136
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,880
in the other side, is very closely related in a profound way to the question of where minds come

137
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,880
from. So, the origin of the self-assembly of your mind and of your body are very related stories,

138
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:57,520
even though they're treated by completely different communities. So, neuroscience and the

139
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,040
behavioral sciences versus developmental biology, molecular biology, cell biology, typically those

140
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,960
folks do not think they're studying the same thing. And I think they're studying exactly the

141
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:14,080
same thing just in different components. So, to look a little further into where we come from.

142
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,880
So, this is an embryonic blastoderm. So, that's basically a flat sheet of cells. So, in the

143
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,760
beginning, what will happen is that the egg will get fertilized, it will divide, and then eventually

144
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,400
flatten out and give rise to, at least in amniotes like us, it will give rise to a

145
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,760
flat sheet of cells. So, you can think about like a little disk or something like that. That's just

146
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,080
a couple cell layers thick. And so, here's your disk. And so, let's just imagine there's about

147
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,560
50,000 cells at this point in this disk. And we look at it and we say, ah, there's an embryo,

148
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,080
maybe a human embryo or a mouse embryo or something. Actually, mice have a different

149
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,000
structure than this. They're kind of weird, but let's say rabbit. So, human or rabbit or some other

150
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,920
amniotes. You look at that and you say, there's one embryo, but there's 50,000 cells. What are you

151
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,840
actually counting when you say there's one embryo? Well, what you're counting is,

152
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,280
you're really counting alignment. You're counting the fact that all of those cells

153
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:13,600
are committed to the same story of what they're going to do in anatomical space. They're all

154
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,520
going to collaborate to build a very particular kind of embryo. They are all connected together

155
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,760
and they are all going to cooperate to do one specific thing, which is to build that.

156
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,600
That's what makes this an embryo. What makes this an embryo is that all of these cells are

157
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,880
committed to the same plan. That doesn't have to be the case. And so, this is some work that was

158
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:42,480
first done in the 40s. I did it again when I was a grad student in the 96 or so. When you take a

159
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,120
duck embryo and you use a little needle to scratch some scratches into it like that, what you'll see

160
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,240
is these little islands here for the next few hours before they rejoin again, each of these

161
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,240
islands doesn't realize the other one is there. So, what they do is they self-organize a new

162
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,520
embryo. Each one of them thinks they're the only one, so they make an embryo. And when they do

163
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:08,240
heal up, you end up with this kind of conjoined twin or triplet. You end up with a few individual

164
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,240
animals coming out of the same blastoderm. So, the question of how many beings, how many cells

165
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,440
are actually in an embryo is tricky. It's not fixed by the genetics. It's anywhere from zero to

166
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,560
probably half a dozen or more depending on what happens. The cells arise in this medium, this

167
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:35,200
cellular blastoderm in real time as a process of physiology. It's not hard-coded. And what that

168
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:41,200
means is that a self has to put itself together. It has to figure out a border between itself

169
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,320
and the outside world. So, here's three embryonic fields sitting there. Each of these cells has

170
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,080
to decide, am I part of this one, or am I part of that one, or who am I part of? And this kind of

171
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:58,240
thing, this medium that can fragment or come together to form some number of coherent individuals

172
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,000
is not just for development. This happens in the brain as well. So, we have split brain patients

173
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,240
that have a cut between their two hemispheres that actually end up having, you then find out that

174
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,400
they have actually, in an important sense, there are two individuals in there that have different

175
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,760
opinions and so on. You can have lots of dissociative identity disorders and various other phenomena

176
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:26,960
that make it clear that it's not so simple as the brain has one cognitive owner and the body

177
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:34,960
has one embryo. It's actually not that simple. And you learn about this when you think about

178
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,520
something like this. So, here's a rat. You train the rat to press the lever and get a delicious

179
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,880
reward. But the thing is that there are cells in this rat that interact with the lever. There are

180
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,960
cells in this gut that get the sugar, but there is no single cell that has both experiences. So,

181
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,320
who is it that owns this associative memory, the fact that the pellet is associated with pressing

182
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,200
the lever? Who owns that? Well, the owner of that memory is not any individual cell. It's the entire

183
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,480
rat. It has to be because no cell has that experience. And there's a kind of cognitive

184
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,960
glue that operates in this rat, which we know as the nervous system, which allows the rat to know

185
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,240
things the individual cells don't know, such as that these two facts are connected. So, that cognitive

186
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,480
glue is a very interesting thing. We're going to study that more of that momentarily. But I want

187
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,440
to be clear that these animals that you typically hear about are not the only game in town as far

188
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,840
as some very interesting aspects of what the biology is trying to tell you. I'm going to show

189
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,840
you a couple of these examples just to sort of expand our horizons about what we need to understand.

190
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,280
So, here's a caterpillar. This caterpillar lives in a two-dimensional world. It's a soft-bodied

191
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,920
creature. It has a controller, a specific brain that's very well suited for driving this kind of

192
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:56,400
soft body around. But it needs to turn into this. This is a flying kind of creature with hard elements

193
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:03,120
and the brain basically, during this metamorphosis process, when the caterpillar turns into the

194
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,320
butterfly, what happens is that the brain is pretty much dissolved. So, most of the connections are

195
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,600
broken. Most of the cells are killed off. Huge refactoring, remodeling, new cells, new brain

196
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,680
is built, quite different, and there's your butterfly. So, that already is kind of amazing.

197
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,600
And you can imagine the sort of philosophical question of what's it like? Never mind what's it

198
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,400
like to be a caterpillar. What's it like to be a caterpillar changing into a butterfly in real

199
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,800
time? Not just on an evolutionary timescale, but in your lifetime drastically. Never mind

200
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,800
puberty. This is a major change. So, that's the first thing. But the second thing is that

201
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,400
it turns out that memories persist through this process. So, a caterpillar that learns

202
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,920
something will still remember it as a butterfly. So, that's amazing. How do memories persist when

203
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:58,320
the brain is basically getting radically refactored? But it's even more than that because, let's say,

204
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,280
what they did was to train caterpillars to look for leaves at a particular color disc.

205
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,160
That kind of information is completely useless to the butterfly because, first of all, the

206
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,520
butterfly doesn't crawl. It flies. And also, it doesn't eat leaves. So, this process has to be

207
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,080
not just the storage of memory. It has to actively remap from what's important to the

208
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,880
caterpillar to what's important to the butterfly. It has to generalize from the concept of leaves

209
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,200
to the concept of food and from specific crawling motions that you might think is what this

210
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,760
simple animal is remembering to something much more complex, a navigational process that will

211
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,400
actually be implemented by flying here, by completely different muscles and a different

212
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,360
architecture. So, this radical process of change, and you might think about what happens to the

213
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,840
individual identity of this organism and what it would be like if the caterpillar knew what was

214
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,520
coming and said, well, you're going to change radically, but don't worry, you'll still have

215
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,040
some of your memories. It's just your priorities will be different. You love leaves now, but you're

216
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,080
not going to care about leaves at all later and you'll want this weird nectar. What is that like?

217
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,080
And we'll come back to this at the end of the talk. How would you convince a creature like this

218
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,040
that this is a perfectly fine thing for them to go through and are they still here? Is this organism

219
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,440
actually still here by the time you get to this stage? And the reason this is important for us

220
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,800
is because humanity is going to change in a way that's somewhat reminiscent of this.

221
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,320
So, that's one kind of example. Another example are these. These are amazing creatures called

222
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,600
planaria, they're flatworms, and when you train them to expect food on these little bumpy circles,

223
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,040
they will remember, and if you cut off their heads with their brain, the tail will sit there

224
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,680
doing nothing. Eventually, the tail will regrow a brand new head, so they regenerate, every piece

225
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,160
will regenerate, and eventually, when they regenerate, you find that they still remember

226
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,120
the original information. So, the memory, not only does this tell you that the memory can be

227
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,640
stored outside the brain, but also that it can be imprinted onto a new brain as the brain develops,

228
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,120
so the movement of memories through tissues. So, all of this is possible because we have this

229
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,440
amazing multi-scale competency architecture. At every scale in your body, from the molecular

230
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,520
networks to the organs and tissues and even groups, these different layers are not just

231
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,280
biological scales, but actually, they have the ability to solve problems. In other words,

232
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,240
they have competencies in different spaces. In the space of possible gene expressions and

233
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:36,800
physiological states and anatomical layouts, all of these things have the ability to solve problems.

234
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,600
I don't have time to show you a whole bunch of examples today, but there are some amazing

235
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,680
examples of these things solving various problems. Now, the thing to keep in mind is that we humans

236
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:54,560
are pretty terrible at detecting intelligence. I mean, we do okay with middle-sized objects

237
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:01,120
moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space, crows and birds and maybe a dolphin

238
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,400
or something like that. We can kind of recognize those as intelligence, but there

239
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:13,680
are other spaces in which complex creatures navigate and spend effort and try to achieve

240
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:20,320
goals and so on. There are gene expression spaces and physiological spaces. I want to focus today

241
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:27,360
on what's known as anatomical morpho space. It's just basically a multi-dimensional space

242
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,560
of all the different shapes that any structure can have. So, in this particular case, here's a

243
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,400
planarian head and it can have different shapes, and these different shapes correspond to the

244
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,120
different settings of these two control knobs, and so you have this two-dimensional space that

245
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,360
shows you where all the different planarian shapes are. The actuality is for complex organisms,

246
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,520
very high-dimensional space. What I want to look at is, I've told you that we're all made of cells,

247
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:00,160
that these cells underlie the emergence or the self-assembly of a unified self, both of

248
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,640
them, cognitively and morphologically, and I want to look at how that works.

249
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:13,840
So, here we are. We start life as a collection of embryonic cells. This is a cross-section

250
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:21,600
through a human torso. So, just imagine where does this incredible order come from, the structure.

251
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,000
Everything is in the right place, the right shape, the right size, next to the right thing.

252
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,320
Where does this order come from? And at that point, even, I mean, I've given the version of this talk

253
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,640
to middle schoolers, and even nine-year-olds will immediately say, well, it's in the genome.

254
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,680
We know where it is. It's in the human genome. But, of course, we can read genomes now, and we know

255
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,880
that that isn't what the genome specifies at all. The genome talks about proteins. The genome

256
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,120
specifies the tiny molecular hardware that every cell gets to have. This isn't directly in the genome

257
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,800
anymore than the structure of a termite nest or the shape of a spider web is in the genome of

258
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,680
those species. All of this is the outcome of physiology and behavior. It's the outcome of

259
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,600
these cells doing their thing with the hardware that they've been given by their genetics.

260
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:12,400
So, if the DNA specifies the hardware, how do these cells actually know what to build?

261
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,400
How do they know when to stop? If we want to convince them to repair something that's been

262
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,000
damaged, how do we communicate that to them? And as engineers, we can ask, actually, what

263
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,560
else is possible? What else can we convince them to build? Same exact hardware, but what more could

264
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:33,040
they build? So, I want to give you a couple of examples of the amazing nature of this process,

265
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,800
because, see, when you look at this, you might think that, well, the biggest thing this thing

266
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,760
has going for it is reliability, that basically it happens the same every single time. And that's

267
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,000
true. Reliability is amazing here, but I want to show you that it's actually much more than that.

268
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,200
What you're looking at here is the cross-section of a little tubule leading to the kidneys of a

269
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,480
psalmander. And normally, there's about eight to 10 of these cells that work together, and they

270
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,120
form this little structure with a space in the middle. You can do this weird trick where you

271
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,800
cause multiple copies of the genetic material to build up in the very early embryo. And so,

272
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,600
when that happens, you still get a normal animal, and it's normal size, but the cells are bigger.

273
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,680
And when you take a cross-section, you find out that, well, the cells are bigger, and so now,

274
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,320
fewer of them created the same kind of lumen. So, let's see where we are so far.

275
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,840
Multiple copies of your chromosome, no problem. Weird cell size, no problem, because you'll scale

276
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,280
it to the number of cells. And most of all, if you make truly gigantic cells, and you do these,

277
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:46,640
these are, I think, 5N or 6N polyploid newts, when you do this, one single cell bends around itself

278
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,520
to give you the exact same kind of structure. Now, that's remarkable because this is a different

279
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,760
molecular mechanism. This is cell-to-cell communication. This is some sort of cytoskeletal

280
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,880
bending. And so, what this means is that in the service of a particular high-level anatomical

281
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,720
structure, these cells can call on different molecular mechanisms to solve their problem.

282
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,640
Okay? So, they're using different tools in their toolkit to get to where they're going.

283
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,160
That is a very good definition of intelligence, to reuse the affordances you have in the service

284
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,440
of a goal when things change. So, when you're a salamander coming into the world, you don't know

285
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,920
how many copies of your genetic material you're going to have. You don't know how many cells you're

286
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,480
going to have or what the size of the cells are going to be. You still need to be able to get the

287
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,640
job done. So, this is not a matter of just being reliable with fixed parts. This is the idea

288
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,800
that what evolution is making is problem-solving agents. It's making a system that is ready for

289
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,880
many, many unexpected things. And not just environment, not just when somebody bites your

290
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,000
leg off and the salamander regenerates it. No, this is unreliability of your own parts. This is not

291
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,640
even being sure of what you're made of. You really can't depend on much. And that's an amazing thing.

292
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,080
And it's quite different than what you normally get in a biology curriculum where they tell you

293
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,320
that your genome, the purpose of your genome is to carry information from a long time away with

294
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,440
maximal fidelity and to minimize errors. And every cell is going to do whatever the genome

295
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,440
says. And in the end, you get this emergent thing. Actually, that's not at all what's happening here.

296
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:25,440
Here's another example. We discovered this a few years ago. These tadpoles need to become frogs.

297
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,320
In order for this tadpole face to make a frog face, all the organs have to move. So, the eyes

298
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,200
have to move, the jaws have to move, and so on. And they normally do this quite reliably. But it

299
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,120
was thought to be a hardwired process. You know, people thought that, well, every organ just moves

300
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,320
in the right direction, this fixed amount, and that's it. What we did was we created these so

301
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,040
called Picasso frogs because we wanted to test how much intelligence is actually in that process,

302
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,280
how much, what kind of problems can it solve? So, we scrambled everything. You can see here,

303
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,960
the eyes on the top of the head, the mouth is off to the side, everything is just a complete mess.

304
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,040
And these guys still become normal frogs because all of these organs will move now in novel paths,

305
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:08,240
paths that these guys don't do, until they get to a correct frog face, and then they stop.

306
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,320
And so, what evolution actually has given you is not a hardwired set of instructions,

307
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,360
but a system for error minimization. Okay, for a way of wherever you happen to start out,

308
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,280
do whatever you have to do to end up in this particular location. This again,

309
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,280
this kind of goal-directedness is something else that you're not going to see in your

310
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,720
developmental biology textbook. This is not emergence, and this is not simply an increase

311
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,400
of complexity. This is problem-solving. And that raises an obvious question about how does it know

312
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,160
what the correct face looks like? Where is the memory for that set point of that homeostatic

313
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,880
process? I want to show you a couple of other things related to the plasticity of this. So,

314
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,520
just so you understand how much play there is between the fixed hardware of your genetics

315
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,240
and the actual outcomes. First of all, this here, you might think this is a photoshop or

316
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,600
something. I didn't believe it the first time I saw it, but this fly is running a stripped-down

317
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,520
ant morphogenetic program on its wings. It's running a virtual ant on its wings, and the idea

318
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:18,240
is that it wiggles its wings to simulate these ants scurrying about, and that keeps the predators

319
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:25,120
away because they don't want to deal with ants. And this is amazing, of course, and it's striking

320
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,240
that it has this pattern, but it's no more striking than the much more intricate pattern

321
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,560
of the actual fly. I mean, all of these are specific morphogenetic patterns, whether 2D

322
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:43,760
or 3D, carried out on this kind of hardware. And you might think that the outcomes are pretty

323
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,520
fixed. I mean, here's an acorn, and you know that all the time what these acorns give rise to is

324
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:56,240
these oak leaves. And you might think that you know what the oak genome actually does. It encodes

325
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,160
this particular shape, but along comes a bioengineer, and this is a non-human bioengineer. This is a

326
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:10,000
little wasp, and what these wasps do is they provide some signals that prompt the rest of the

327
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,560
tissue to build something like this. They're hacking the morphogenetic competencies of this leaf.

328
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,920
They're not changing the genome, and what they're doing is providing some instructions that cause

329
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:28,160
the leaf cells to adopt a different set point in anatomical space. Now, would you ever have any idea

330
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,560
looking at these flat green leaves, and how reliable they are? Would you have any idea that

331
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,680
they're capable of building something like this? I mean, we have no idea. So that just reminds us

332
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,960
that this whole notion of developmental constraint is really probably a constraint in our thinking.

333
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,400
It's not a constraint in the biology. The option space for morphogenesis is enormous,

334
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,440
and what we need to do is to discover the prompts, the language that we can use to get

335
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,680
them to build other things, and it clearly doesn't require modifying the hardware.

336
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,960
The genetics of this thing are still completely intact. So now comes kind of the meat of the

337
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,720
talk, which is that if morphogenesis is the behavior of a collective intelligence operating

338
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,960
in anatomical space, that's what I've been getting at for the last few slides, is the idea that

339
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,400
the act of creating complex anatomical shapes is really behavior. It's behavior in an anatomical

340
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,280
space of possibilities, and it's done by a collective intelligence, which just like us,

341
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,120
we're all collective intelligences, but that collective intelligence thinks about shape as

342
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,600
opposed to moving around in 3D space. So now we need to ask, how do we communicate with that

343
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,560
intelligence? I mean, the WASP did it through millions of years of evolution. We would like

344
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,000
to do it faster. And where does it store its memories? These are some things that we've been

345
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
looking at. Well, we know that one way to store memories and communicate with a collective

346
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
intelligence is through the nervous system. Now, the nervous system does it via computations

347
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,240
in an electrical network, and you can actually try to decode those. This is the work of people

348
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,720
doing a neural decoding to try to read the electrical activity of the brain and to know

349
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,840
what thoughts and preferences and memories and so on the system has. Well, it turns out that

350
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,960
this system, this ability to store memories in an electrical network, to use an electrical

351
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,480
network to integrate information across many, many, many cells, both in space and in time,

352
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,720
is something that evolution discovered a really long time ago. It is way older than nerve and

353
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,680
muscle. Bacterial biofilms were probably the first to do this, so long predating multicellularity.

354
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,640
And what we've done is to develop some of the first tools to read and write the mind of the

355
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,800
collective intelligence of your body. So by taking a lot of the concepts from neuroscientists and

356
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:58,480
really emphasizing this idea that neuroscience isn't about neurons at all. Neuroscience is really

357
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,720
about scaling of information from tiny competent subunits into much larger coherent cells that

358
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,760
have higher intelligence in other spaces. That's really what this is about. And that doesn't just

359
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,440
work in the brain, that works in your entire body. So the first thing I want to show you is

360
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,000
some of the techniques that can be used. One thing we have is this thing we develop called

361
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,280
voltage sensitive fluorescent dye imaging. And that means that without having to poke the cells

362
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:30,720
with electrodes, you can get in real time, this is a time lapse of a frog embryo, this is a frog

363
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,720
putting its face together, you can get a map of all the electrical states and thus you can try to

364
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,800
learn to decode what the system is trying to build. What are the computations that they're

365
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:52,320
doing? We call this the electric face. This is a bioelectric map of the face ectoderm long before

366
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,080
any of these organs actually appear. You can see that cells already know here's where we're

367
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,480
going to place the eye, the left eye actually comes in a little bit later, here's where the

368
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,880
mouth is going to go, here are the placodes. This is you are literally seeing the way you

369
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:11,040
would with a brain scan, you are literally seeing the content of the collective intelligence of

370
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,720
morphogenesis in the body of these animals. So these are normal patterns, in fact these are

371
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,640
required for normal development as I'll show you momentarily. But here's a pathological pattern,

372
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,760
and this is induced by injecting a human oncogene into these embryos which eventually

373
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,600
will make a tumor. But these tumors have an aberrant bioelectrical profile because what happens,

374
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,160
the first thing that happens with this oncogene is that it causes an electrical disconnection

375
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,360
from cells from their environment. And when cells disconnect, they immediately lose the ability

376
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:50,720
to remember these large grandiose goals that they were working on, so making complex organs and

377
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,160
fixing defects and so on, they're just amoebas now. That boundary between self and world has now

378
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:01,760
shrunk, that cognitive lycone where before the goal was the size of an organ or maybe the whole

379
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,840
organism, now it's down to the size of a single cell, and to them the rest of the body is just

380
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,760
an environment now. So this is where you get metastasis and progression because as far as

381
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,320
they're concerned, they're just amoebas living in an environment, and they go where they want and

382
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,280
they reproduce as much as they want. And so once you understand that, you can try for really

383
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,960
interesting cancer therapeutics, which is what we're doing in our lab. Don't try to kill the cells

384
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,400
with toxic chemotherapy. What if we reinflate their sense of self? What if we reconnect them,

385
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,240
forcibly reconnect them to the large electrical network that can remember what a proper organ is?

386
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,600
And so when you do that, so this is the same animal. Here's the oncoprotein has this red

387
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,520
fluorescence on it. You can see it's blazingly strongly expressed. In fact, it's all over the

388
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,760
place, but there's no tumor. And there's no tumor because we co-injected an ion channel

389
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,360
that modulates, it's an RNA that modulates the electrical property of the cell to force them

390
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,200
to remain in connection, despite what the oncogene is saying. And after that, it doesn't

391
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,840
matter that they have this genetic defect, they behave appropriately and they build nice organs

392
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:12,560
and so on. So that's a story at the level of single cells, how you scale individual cells

393
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:22,720
into a larger set of goals. But I want to show you something even larger scale than that,

394
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:30,160
which is we saw in that electric phase, there's a little eye spot which tells the animal that

395
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,800
that's where the eye is going to go. So we can ask a simple question, what happens if you

396
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,360
reproduce that bioelectric pattern somewhere else? Can you tell this group of cells to build

397
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,440
an eye somewhere else? And it turns out you can. Here it is, we injected some potassium

398
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,400
ion channel RNA into a location that normally would make a gut. So here's this is a tadpole,

399
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,680
here's the mouth, here's the eye, here's the gut. And if you tell these cells using an appropriate

400
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,160
voltage signal that, hey, you should be making an eye, boom, that's what they do. And these eyes

401
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,080
have normal lens, right, an optic nerve, all the same stuff. And you might see in your developmental

402
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:12,400
biology textbook that only cells in the anterior and erected are here are competent to make eye.

403
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,200
So that isn't true, that's only true if you try to prompt them with the so-called master eye gene.

404
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,360
So if you put in PAC-6 the master eye gene, yes, that's true, only these cells can do it.

405
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,920
But again, that limitation of competency isn't in the embryo, that's on us. That's because we

406
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,920
didn't know the community, didn't know the right way to talk to these cells. Once you understand

407
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,480
the bioelectric code, actually it turns out that almost any region in this embryo is competent to

408
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,880
make eye. And if you should happen to only inject a few cells, so here this is a lens sitting out

409
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,520
in the tail of a tadpole somewhere, if you only inject a few cells, these blue cells are the ones

410
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,760
we injected, then they know there's not enough of them to make a good eye, so what do they do? They

411
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,320
recruit a bunch of their neighbors to work with them to make an eye, just like ants and

412
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,600
termites will recruit their buddies to solve a problem. So now you can see that what we're

413
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,240
doing is providing signals. We didn't tell these cells how to build an eye, we didn't say anything

414
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,240
about the stem cells or the gene expression, we have no idea how to build an eye. What we did find

415
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,800
was a message that we can transmit through this bioelectrical interface that says build an eye

416
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,440
here. And once you get the cells by in so that they are convinced that that in fact is what they

417
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,800
should be building, after that you don't need to do anything, they will do what they do best,

418
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:28,800
they'll build to a morphogenetic spec. We know this, I want to show you, there's just a couple

419
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,560
of things left here, I want to show you another kind of pattern memory in these planaria, so here's

420
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:42,160
a normal flatworm. These guys, you can cut them into pieces and they will always regenerate correctly,

421
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,920
so every piece normally makes a nice one-headed worm 100% of the time. But there's a bioelectric

422
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,960
pattern there that we were able to read out and then we were able to modify it. And when you

423
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,800
modify that pattern, you make two-headed worms. And when you make these two-headed worms, what

424
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,240
happens is that you have rewritten the memory of what a correct worm is supposed to look like,

425
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,080
so that when these fragments, when these middle fragments go to regenerate, they consult the

426
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,320
pattern to see what what should a normal worm look like, they see that it says two heads,

427
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,200
and they go ahead and they build two heads. These two-headed worms now in plain water,

428
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,880
meaning no more manipulation of any kind, are now forever two-headed. If you keep cutting them,

429
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,320
they will just continue to regenerate as two-headed. We have permanently changed the target morphology,

430
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,800
the pattern to which they regenerate, but we never touch the DNA, there's nothing wrong with the

431
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,200
genetics here. If we were to throw these guys into the Charles River, 100 years later some

432
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,640
scientists would come along, they'd scoop up some single-headed worms and some double-headed

433
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,520
worms, they'd say, oh, cool, a speciation event, let's sequence the genome and see what made the

434
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,640
difference. There's nothing wrong with their genome, that's not where the information is.

435
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,400
And so that's really important to understand that much as we've been learning from computer science

436
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:01,920
for a really long time now, the hardware, if it's good hardware, does not fully constrain

437
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,320
what the software is able to do. And so this is a kind of pattern memory, it's long-term stable,

438
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,080
it's rewriteable because we can turn these guys back to one-headed, there you can see what these

439
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:17,120
two-headed guys are doing when they're hanging out. And so the question of how many heads should

440
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:23,840
a plenarian have is not written in the DNA, what is written in the DNA is the construction of

441
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:30,560
some biological material that by default will develop a pattern memory that says one head,

442
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,480
so that's what it does by default, very reliably, but you can change it, you can rewrite it.

443
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,400
And the fact that biological tissue is reprogrammable in this way is hugely important for biomedicine

444
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,880
and for other things. And so I hope you're starting to see that all the emphasis on

445
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,760
genetics and on the genome and all that, it's all very important because you have to understand

446
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,720
your hardware, but it's just the beginning. It's the same, the reason that on your laptop,

447
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,040
if you want to switch from Photoshop to Microsoft Word, you don't get out your soldering iron and

448
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,920
start rewiring because it's reprogrammable. Neither does biology. Biology is using an

449
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,680
incredibly reprogrammable medium that solves problems and can be communicated with using

450
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,760
various interfaces, for example, this bioelectrical interface. So we've talked about the reliability

451
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,880
of development and what things do by default. We've talked about various ways to hack, communicate

452
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,440
with and reprogram the collective intelligence of cells so they can build other variants on the

453
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,560
form. But where do these goals actually come from? So when we called up a second head here,

454
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,800
the second head looks just like the first head. Where are these patterns really? If it's not in

455
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,880
the DNA, what's the space of possible patterns? What else can we do? And by the way, I didn't

456
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,440
show you, but we can actually turn these worms into heads of other species, about 100 to 150

457
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,760
million years' distance. So triangular worms become round, become flat, but you can make the

458
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,880
hardware go to other regions of that space that normally belong to other species. But okay,

459
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,520
those are all evolutionarily defined forms. Is that it? Is that where the forms come from? They're

460
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:20,560
basically selected for and then there's a finite set of forms that can be implemented by the hardware.

461
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,800
Well, we decided to look at this in a synthetic kind of bioengineering way. And what we did was

462
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:33,120
we took some cells, some skin cells from frog embryos, and we let them kind of reboot their

463
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:38,880
multicellularity. We took them aside, we liberated them from their normal interactions with other

464
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,120
cells. And what they did, they could have done many things. They could have died, they could have

465
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,360
crawled away from each other, they could have made a flat monolayer like cell culture.

466
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,800
What they did instead is they merged into something we then named xenobots.

467
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,240
Xenobot because Xenopus lavus is the name of the frog, and we think this is a biorebotics platform.

468
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,880
So they start to swim. They have little silly, little hairs that are normally used to distribute

469
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,280
mucus down the side of the frog, but here they row. So these guys are rowing to the left, these

470
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,200
cells are rowing to the right, and as a result, this thing moves forward. They can go in circles

471
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,920
like this, they can kind of patrol back and forth like that. They have various collective behaviors.

472
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,960
These two are sort of dancing around. This one's going on some sort of long journey.

473
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,560
These ones are doing nothing. They have some very rich calcium signaling. You can see that here,

474
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,440
which is usually a sign of some information processing that's going on in these cells.

475
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,000
Here's one that is navigating this maze. So it's going to take this corner without bumping

476
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,600
into the opposite wall. So there it is. And then here spontaneously, for some reason that we don't

477
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,160
know, it turns around and goes back where it came from. It has spontaneous behavior. Again,

478
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:53,840
remember, this is just skin. These are just epithelial cells. And they have lots of interesting

479
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:02,000
behaviors that we can talk about. But one of the most amazing things they do is called kinematic

480
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,880
replication. So just imagine, we've made it completely impossible for these things to reproduce

481
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,800
the normal froggy fashion. They don't have any of the reproductive organs, they don't have any of

482
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,600
that. But in this novel configuration, they figured out a way to make copies of themselves. And

483
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,720
here's how they do it. If you provide them with loose skin cells, this loose material, what they

484
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:27,040
do is they run around and they sort of collect those loose skin cells into little balls like this.

485
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,520
And because what they're working with is an agential material, meaning these are not passive

486
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,480
pellets, these are cells, for the same reason that we were able to make xenobots, they make the

487
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,040
second generation of xenobots. And these little balls that they make mature, and guess what they

488
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,840
do? They run around and make the next generation of xenobots and so on. And this is kinematic

489
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:51,120
replication. It's kind of von Neumann's dream of a robot that went around and made copies of

490
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,360
itself from materials it finds in the environment. I mean, just think this, there's never been any

491
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:01,360
xenobots. There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot. This is not in the lineage of frogs.

492
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:08,000
Where does this come from? Their shape, their behaviors, the kinematic self-replication, all

493
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,520
the other things they can do. Where does that come from? It's very hard to say that this was the

494
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:20,000
subject of selection. So again, I come back to this theme that while the hardware was absolutely

495
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,520
selected for, I don't think it was selected to make frogs. I don't think that what evolution does is

496
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,880
create solutions for specific problems or things that are fit in a specific environment.

497
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,720
I think what evolution does is make creative problem-solving agents that they'll do the same

498
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:42,000
thing under default conditions, but once you start making changes and challenging them,

499
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:50,080
they often rise to the occasion and solve problems in very novel ways that reflect dynamics that

500
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:58,480
they've not seen before. And lest you think this is some trick of, you know, unique to frogs or

501
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:04,480
embryos, I mean, when we first published all this stuff, some people said, well, frogs, amphibians

502
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,680
are pretty plastic and embryos are especially plastic. So maybe this is some kind of a specific

503
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:18,800
thing in frog embryology. So the last thing I want to show you is this. So here's this little guy

504
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,040
running around and I will ask you what this is. And you might think that this is something I got

505
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,520
off the bottom of a pond somewhere, right, some sort of primitive organism. And then I can tell

506
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,120
you that, well, we've sequenced its genome and you'll say, oh, what's the genome? What does it

507
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:38,080
look like? And I'll say, well, this is 100% Homo sapiens. These are adult human cells. There's no

508
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:45,200
embryonics here. This is adult tracheal cells taken from human donors. Most of them elderly in

509
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:53,200
their 70s and 80s. And when given the chance, they reboot themselves and have a new life as these

510
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,480
things. We call them anthropots for obvious reasons. And they have all kinds of novel shapes

511
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:07,520
and behaviors. I call this kind of a technology for personalized agential interventions because

512
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:14,160
if you ask, what can these things do? Well, one thing they can do is this. If you take human neurons

513
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,960
and plate them on a dish and put a big scratch through them, these anthropots can settle down.

514
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:25,120
We call this a super bot because there's probably 10 of them here. They'll settle down and within a

515
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,520
few days you lift them up and you see that what they did was they took the two sides of the wound

516
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,320
and they knitted the nerves together. So they have the ability to repair these kind of neural

517
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,320
wounds. I mean, who would have thought that your tracheal cells, which normally sit quietly in your

518
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:44,320
airway for decades, that given the opportunity taken out of the body, they would actually

519
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:51,520
reassemble themselves into a new kind of creature with these new capacities. And so this is, I think,

520
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,160
hugely important for the future of medicine because just imagine, once we understand what

521
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,720
kind of healing effects these guys can have, they can be injected into your body. They do not

522
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,440
require immune suppression because they're made of your own cells. So personalized medicine in

523
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,040
that way. They share with your body all the priors about what health is, what diseases,

524
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,720
inflammation, cancer. You don't have to build all those detectors from scratch like you would with

525
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:22,240
some sort of engineered nanobot because these are your own cells. They already understand all those

526
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:29,280
things. And so again, you start to see this plasticity. Again, what you just saw is not

527
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,640
some embryonic developmental stage that they're recovering back in their history. There is no

528
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:41,040
such stage. This is completely novel set of behaviors. And so now I'm going to finish up here

529
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,640
with kind of some big picture thinking here. What I've been telling you about all of these stories

530
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,520
and all of their kind of biomedical implications for cancer and birth defects and regenerative medicine,

531
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:58,480
there's a bigger picture here, which is that what we're talking about is an example of how to

532
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,120
recognize and how to communicate with an unconventional intelligence. It is not just

533
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:09,920
philosophy that thinking about groups of cells as decision making, memory having goal directed

534
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,360
beings has led us to lots of discoveries that were not made by the standard paradigm, which sees them

535
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:21,280
as simple machines. So my point is that along this spectrum, I call this the spectrum of

536
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,240
persuadability because it's all about what kind of tools you're going to use to communicate

537
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:31,680
and control these various systems. So here it's hardware rewiring and maybe some control theory

538
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,520
and cybernetics with things like thermostats. And then here maybe behavioral science and training

539
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,320
and things like that. And then here you have some sort of rich relationship with cogent reasoning

540
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:49,040
and so on. The idea is that we can't just have philosophical feelings about where things fit

541
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,840
on this continuum. Most people assume that cells are somewhere down here, that they're basically

542
00:49:53,840 --> 00:50:00,080
simple machines that need to be treated that way. And that leaves a lot on the table because we're

543
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:05,840
doing all kinds of interesting things with cell training and really taking advantage of the problem

544
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,640
solving competencies of these things. And so we have to do experiments. And so that brings us back

545
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:18,160
to the issue of AI because the question of AI isn't about today's language models. Today,

546
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:25,040
it's pretty easy to say, well, GPT-4 isn't really like a human mind and so on. No, it isn't. And it

547
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,520
doesn't matter for two reasons. First, because there are many interesting minds that are not human

548
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:38,000
minds and some of them are quite alien. And second, because the whole point is that you

549
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,040
can't just assume these things. You have to do experiments. You have to ask yourself,

550
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,960
do I know where intelligence comes from? Why do simple things? And we've studied some very

551
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,400
simple things that have amazing, unexpected, emergent, intelligent behaviors. Do we know

552
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,240
where that comes from and how to recognize them? And I'll tell you that at this moment we don't.

553
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:01,120
So this is the science of diverse intelligence. And we need to be extremely careful. And I think

554
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:08,400
this is where the ethics comes in. We need to be extremely careful about not denying moral

555
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,600
worth and various kinds of ethical protections to beings because they don't look like us.

556
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:20,800
Humans have a very long history of trying to make separations between in-group and out-group

557
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:34,480
based on really pretty ridiculous, very surfacing characteristics. And in your lifetime, you are

558
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:41,200
going to be confronted with all sorts of novel beings. So all of Darwin's endless forms, most

559
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,720
beautiful here on Earth, are like a tiny corner of this whole space. You know, hybrids and cyborgs

560
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:52,720
and all kinds of non-neurotypical humans with implants and different kinds of connections to

561
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:59,200
other creatures and to other technical systems. You know, pretty much any combination of evolved

562
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,080
material, engineered material and software is some kind of being. Okay, there are going to be

563
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,400
chimeras and cyborgs. And so it's not about the language models of today. It's about beings that

564
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,440
are nowhere with you on the tree of life. You cannot decide how you're going to relate to them

565
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,360
in the old ways, which was to, you know, sort of knock on it. And if you hear a metallic clanging

566
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,520
sound, you say, aha, so you were made in the factory and you're boring and I can take you

567
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,680
apart. And that's okay. Whereas if you heard like this soft, woolly thud, you would say,

568
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:35,040
ah, well, you're a real being like me and I have to treat you well, even though we're not even very

569
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:41,040
good at that as humans. But the point is that those kinds of categories are going to be worthless

570
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,800
because the space of possible bodies and minds is extending radically. And we're going to have to

571
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,760
develop much better ethical frameworks for kind of, you know, I'm sure you've heard of symbiosis,

572
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,400
I think what we're really talking about is a kind of synthbiosis, where we have to learn how to

573
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:02,160
relate to beings that are different than us. And that, you know, we're going to have to figure

574
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,840
out how you how you detect where things are on this continuum, so that we find appropriate balance

575
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:12,080
points between objectophilia. Objectophilia is the thing where people fall in love with bridges

576
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:16,880
and, you know, they think the Eiffel Tower is, you know, married to them and so on. Right. So,

577
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,800
things down here, you're not going to have that deep relationship with things up here,

578
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,880
but other people are really trapped in the other end of the continuum where they see things that

579
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:31,920
are not like today's standard humans. And they say, you know, those are not real minds worthy of

580
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,080
care and respect and so on. And that very quickly devolves to a kind of idea that's basically

581
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:43,760
love only your own kind. And I think that's that's that's probably lots much worse than this.

582
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,480
So, we really need to, and if anybody has questions we can talk about it, we really need to ask,

583
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:54,640
you know, given all of these facts, what are what is a human actually? And I have a kind of a weird

584
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:01,040
answer to that. And if you were going on on a long journey and you wanted a companion,

585
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,560
what is it that you actually care about? You know, when you say, you know, you don't want a

586
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:09,040
Roomba, that's that's not enough. But what do you actually care about? It's not the DNA. It's I

587
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,440
don't think anybody has any allegiance to our particular human DNA or the specific set of

588
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,920
organs. What is it that you do want, you know, in a rich human level relationship? That's that's

589
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,920
very worth thinking about. So, okay, so I'm going to I'm going to stop here. I'm anybody who's

590
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,320
interested in this stuff. Here's a bunch of papers that go into all of this in great detail.

591
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,520
Most importantly, I need to thank all the people who did the work that I showed you today. So,

592
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:37,520
here are all the all the postdocs and students and everybody else who who contributed. We

593
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,400
have lots of amazing collaborators. Our funding comes from all kinds of people have to do a

594
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,040
disclosure here because there are three companies that have spun out of our lab that are supporting

595
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,760
some of our work. So there's some business connections here. But most of all, I always

596
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,960
thank the model system because because the various animals and plants do all of the

597
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,520
heavy lifting in teaching us about biology and about ourselves. So thank you so much. I'll take

598
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:08,560
questions.
