0	14680	I guess an underlying theme for what interests me the most, in biology and science in general,
14680	23600	to look for simple underlying principles, and my favorite, one of my favorite costos
23600	31200	paintings is this one that kind of illustrates that point where, as you can tell here, it goes
31200	42960	in this series of plates depicting a bull going from removing more and more detail until it gets
42960	51760	to the essence of the bull. And that's sort of my scientific reto that may be not fully embraced
51920	60800	in biology, universally, as it is embraced in math and physics and chemistry. And what I think is
60800	68960	one of the sort of big problems in the way biologists, and I mean by that mostly experimental
68960	76080	sort of mainstream biomedical science type of biology, is that we are addicted to complicate it
77040	85920	and devalue what's simple and often confuse it with what's simplistic. And in my definition,
85920	90880	I'd say simple is when you get rid of anything that's not essential for understanding the problem.
92080	97520	Simplistic is when you remove something that is important, and so it's you have to
97520	102480	get the right intuition not to confuse it. And complicated is when you add things that are
102560	108400	nonessential. And that's, I think we're all experiencing that phase in my medical research
108400	115200	now where there is too much of nonessential is added because methods are available to generate data.
117200	126160	And so that's what often makes complex systems look complicated, whereas as you all know,
126160	133840	the complex systems are not complicated. They have underlying simple rules. So what I chose to
133840	143840	talk about today is one of the aspects, one aspect of biology that we're interested in in lab,
144560	151360	which has to do with tissue biology and I would say cellular sociology or
151360	157760	social lives of cells. And because tissues are complex systems, composed of multiple
158800	164400	agents that are cells that interact in some way and generate all kinds of properties that we try to
164400	171280	understand. And the properties that we see, these are observables, and they don't tell us what the
171280	178480	rules are that generated them. And that's sort of the main interest in that area for me. So we think
178480	189840	about the notion of tissue, of course, is very familiar. It's a textbook notion. It's very commonly
189840	195440	used. We all kind of sort of know what we mean when we say tissues, but at the same time, they're
195440	205360	not well defined. If we try to give a definition to a cell, then we're fine to the organ to organ
205360	213280	systems, we can give formal definitions, but for tissues, we actually can't. And all the
213280	220880	available definitions are quite ambiguous. As our distinctions between tissues where one tissue
220880	226800	stops and other starts and so forth. So traditional classifications that are divide them into four
226800	232800	major types of epidial, connective, muscle, and neuronal. It has a limited utility, mostly when
232880	238560	we think in terms of development of organism, when we think in terms of pathology, in terms of
239920	244400	any kind of biology that operates at the tissue level, we don't think of tissues as
244400	251360	a peculiar versus neuronal and so on. It's always we think of it as a collection of cell types that
251360	259360	belong to all these different types of origin. So that's the first problem. So we are kind of
259360	263760	on a shaky ground to begin with, because we're dealing with something that's ill-defined.
264960	271040	And that leads to these major gaps in our understanding of tissues. What are the
271040	277440	patterns of cell organization within tissues? What aspects are pre-programmed versus emergent?
277440	284240	And what are general themes and what are special cases? And that's again,
284400	292400	something that I think biologists depreciate less than let's say physicists, distinguishing
292400	299840	special cases from general cases. And that's what makes this whole area so interesting and
299840	307600	challenging and fascinating to understand. To use tissue biology as sort of an umbrella term
307600	315920	for understanding social organization of cells to think of cells as agents in a complex system.
317040	326480	And so this is to just illustrate what exactly our gaps in understanding are. If we compare
326480	332640	organismal biology, cell biology, and tissue biology, it's very clear that in tissue biology we
332720	336480	are limited by understanding, not so much by data, but by understanding.
336480	342640	So in organismal biology, we can tell that these animals that look drastically different,
342640	350080	they're all variations on the theme of a mammal. And we can tell that there are some deviations from
350080	359840	the common theme that we see in whales, shrews, and so forth. But we can imagine a generic mammal
359840	364800	with all the universal parts, all the organ systems, they all have
367360	371680	central nervous system, two lungs, two kidneys, and so forth. And we know how they function,
371680	378800	we connect it, and we can draw a generic like a schema of a mammal. And then we can also say that
378800	385280	a mammal is a special case of vertebrate, which is more general schema and so forth. If we go to
385280	390800	cells, the biology cell level is the same, we can look at this and these are dramatically different
391600	396800	cells, dramatically different looking cells, especially if they were drawn to scale, it would
396800	403680	be even more dramatic difference. And yet we know that this is all variation on the common theme of
403680	413840	eukaryotic cell, mammalian cells shown here on the right. And we are not fooled by the fact that
413840	419440	the most abundant and most easily accessible cell type, which is a red blood cell,
419440	426480	actually doesn't have a nucleus in mammals. We don't conclude from that that most cell types
427280	435280	don't have nucleus. And therefore, this is something essential and important to understand. So
435280	440640	we're not confused by that because we know enough cell biology to tell that this is a special case.
440640	449120	And the reason I'm emphasizing this is because in here, it's an obvious case of general versus
449120	455360	special. But when we lack that understanding, we can be confused by looking at something that's
455360	461520	most common, most observable. And we don't have the right intuition to tell if it's a general case
461520	468960	or special case. So at tissue level, at the cell level, at organismal level, we have that type of
468960	475360	knowledge. But if we look at the tissue level with different tissues, and then now we can tell
476160	482880	whether these tissues coming from different organs all represent variations on a theme.
484160	490880	And what that generic theme is, and we cannot draw that generic tissue the way we can for generic
490880	498560	cell or generic organism. And we don't know if there is one theme, and these are also kind
498640	504160	of deviations or variations on that theme, or there may be more than one thing, or maybe there
504800	510080	are no common themes at all. But presumably, there are common things because all tissues
510080	517200	have to solve the same set of problems. They have to solve a problem of having the right cell type
517200	525440	in the right ratios, right quantities, right spatial arrangements, and so forth. They should
528160	533360	have some of the others. And these are the same problems every tissue in every animal has to
533360	537600	solve. And presumably, it's been solved once in the beginning, and then everything was built on
537600	543920	that solution. And therefore, we have a reason to think that there are general principles and
543920	550000	general themes, and everything is some variations on these themes. And some of these cases may indeed
550000	556320	be special cases. And that's what we want to understand, and that's what we currently don't
556320	565200	understand. So instead, we have this is a picture like this, which is a textbook picture of what's
565200	574480	supposed to be tissue. And so the questions we want to understand is what the rules that define,
574480	579920	for example, cellular composition of tissues, how these different cell types know that they belong
579920	586240	there in the right amounts, in the right proportions, in the right locations, and so forth.
587440	594480	And if we approach it from the way that generally we approach something unknown, we try to kind of
594480	600080	catalog things, we describe them by shapes by whatever some properties that we can measure.
600800	608720	Nowadays, we do it by single cell analysis by imaging and so forth. And we generate this ever
608720	617360	more complete catalog of characteristics. And that catalog doesn't bring us any closer to
618240	624160	addressing the questions I mentioned in the previous slide. And
626720	636720	there is a little doubt that having ever more complete description of cells and tissues
637520	643680	using whatever next generation methodologies might be that may image every single molecule,
643680	650880	let's say, and so forth, the amount of data will grow astronomically. And yet it's not going to
650880	654720	bring us any closer to addressing the questions that I mentioned in the previous slide.
656400	663200	And let's just use an analogy here for, like, let's say if you're an alien and you're doing,
663200	669200	you know, PhD thesis on human social structure, you came to Earth and you look at people and you
669200	674480	have this very powerful alien technologies that allow you to characterize everything you want
674480	684480	about every human being. And you get the characteristics like names, height, weight, color of
684480	693280	eyes, color of hair, insulin, glucose measurements, heart rate, and you catalog that increasingly.
693280	702000	You know how many cells that person has versus that person has. And clearly that kind of data
702000	706960	would be completely useless to understand what the human social structure is.
708960	715360	On the other hand, if you approach it from a different perspective, you look at the human
715440	724080	social group, and you start noticing that there is some ways that these different individuals
724080	730400	relate each other that may define not identities, like identity characteristics,
730400	736640	like name, height, weight, and so forth, but rather that some of them are parents and some of them
736640	741920	are children, some of them are husbands and wives, some of them colleagues, some of them friends,
741920	748080	some enemies, and so forth. And what all these words mean, these are categories. So there's a
748080	756080	category of the parent, category of scientists, category of neighbors. But these categories
756720	767760	defined, if we compare category of a parent or neighbor or friend versus the category of
767840	774080	a good person or bad person or a scientist by profession. So the profession category is still
774080	779440	the cataloging category. It's just like the names and heights and whatever, body mass.
780240	789760	Parent, friend, neighbor, these are categories that are defined by relations. And what I think is
789760	797040	needed, we have the notion of a cell type, and we have increasingly detailed characteristics of
797040	802880	cell types. And that's just like getting more and more data about individuals. But what we need is
802880	810080	to go from cell types, which is a useful and fundamental notion, to the notion of cell categories.
810080	814320	And the way they can be defined is just like the aliens who define social structure.
815360	823760	They need to be defined in terms of relations. So just like relation parent child provides deep
823760	829440	insight into social structure or relation, friends and enemies and so forth, those are provides
830160	839440	deep insights that can explain social structure. Similarly, if we define cell relations,
840560	846080	appropriate types of what would be the appropriate types of relations, that will give us insight
846080	854000	into social organization of cells. And so what I think we need to do is to,
855040	858640	rather than being obsessed with getting more and more granular data about,
858640	865200	you know, the identity characteristics, we need to define some categories based on relations.
865840	876160	And so we need to ask what are different cell types equivalent in some ways in terms of their
876160	881680	roles in tissue organization. So that would define their relation, right? So if you have a teacher
882320	887280	in one school, teacher in another school, they may teach different subjects, but they're defined by
887280	893040	the relation of teacher and student. And if we know that relation, then we can say, okay, there's a
894000	898960	category of teacher and there's category of student. So what are the appropriate
898960	905520	relevant categories for cells? And also, I would mention that not all relations are equally informative.
906400	912800	Right? So the category, some get some relations, some more fundamental than others. So the same
912800	920800	would apply to cells. And so we can define this, what would be called equals. So relations here,
920800	931600	I mean in more like in mathematical terms, like the way the relations are defined on sets. And they
931600	938000	can be symmetric, reflexive, transitive. And so it's in that kind of spirit of the way that
938000	944160	relations defines on sets, it's basically a way to partition set. So we have a set of cells and
944160	949680	what are different ways we can partition it, just like we can take social group and partition it
949680	956960	into parents, children, teachers, students and so forth. And that I think is what is missing and
956960	962880	what's limiting that we don't have that kind of a perspective. And this is something we're actually
962880	968800	working on, sort of from theory perspective, I'll just give a sense of what we're thinking now,
968800	975840	because we don't have a complete list of that yet. So this is the visual representation of what I
975840	983280	mean that we go from cell type paradigm, where we describe cell types, type A, B, C and D, to cell
983280	989920	relations paradigm, which will define cell categories. And here, for example, one relation will define
989920	994480	between these two cell types and other relation between these two cell types and so on. And
994480	1000400	importantly, this relation, let's say relation A, may apply not just for this epithelial and
1000400	1005520	this mesenchymal cell, it may apply to other pairs of cells that belong to different types.
1006720	1011040	And that's what's critical, because that's where we hit the wall when we try to understand
1011040	1016640	general principle, and then we find, oh, macrophage is doing something here. So therefore,
1016640	1022240	macrophage is a cell type, it has this kind of a property. And then we don't find that example
1022240	1028880	somewhere else and say, oh, oops, it's not generalizable. It may not be generalizable for cell type,
1028880	1033840	but as a relation, it would be. So that's the general idea. And what are the types of relations?
1033840	1041040	So I will just use a few examples to illustrate it. And the first example also deals with the
1041040	1050720	notion of what is the general theme in tissue organization. And if we think about what's the
1050720	1060480	simplest setup for an animal, we would see that all animals have epithelial mesenchymal
1061440	1067600	units as the most fundamental, most ancient units of organization of tissues. There are
1067600	1072480	no animals that don't have epithelial mesenchymal units, even the simplest, like spongy and
1072480	1078000	plecozoa, that's basically, they pretty much don't have anything else, but that's what you
1078000	1085520	have to have an animal. And they always have a particular type of arrangement. Epithelial cells,
1085520	1092000	of course, form a polarized sheet. Mesenchymal cells are underneath and they're separated by
1092000	1099360	basically membrane. So that's a general structural setup. But what's interesting going beyond that
1099360	1104880	is that there is a particular type of relation between mesenchym and epithelium. And that relation
1105600	1114080	in one instance is based on a symmetry in information transfer. So mesenchymal cells,
1114080	1121200	for example, have positional information encoded by Hawke's genes. That translates into the choice
1121200	1126800	of appropriate morphogen signals that they produce, for example, and then epithelial cells have
1126800	1133200	several fade choices. And then mesenchymal cells through this morphogen signal dictate the fade
1133200	1138800	choice that would be appropriate for a given positional information. So we have this type of
1138800	1147680	instructional relation here. And this is seen as a common theme in development where mesenchymal
1147680	1152640	will affect the epithelium to shape it into different organs, different spatial structures
1152640	1158320	and so forth. And you can particularly well see to this development of different types of glands,
1158960	1166880	which you can see in the next slide even better. We can say now you go from this generic
1166880	1171600	organization of epithelium mesenchymal. Mesenchymal is not shown here for simplicity.
1171600	1176480	And then you can get all kinds of structures through a process of continuous transformation.
1177200	1180880	So if you think about it as geometric transformation, it's an example of
1180880	1185280	continuous transformation. There's nothing fundamentally new added here.
1185520	1190560	All that happens is continuous transformation. These are all topologically in bearing.
1192000	1199760	And that means that by just using that simple module and just adding the variables that affect
1199760	1207360	the degree of branching, you can generate all sorts of structures. And from a simple gut tube,
1207360	1213920	you can go to making various types of glands. And ultimately, you can make pancreas and liver
1213920	1219600	and lungs and all by process of continuous transformation. So that's how powerful that
1219600	1224960	effect of a relation between mesenchym and epithelium is. And of course, this goes back to
1225520	1231920	Mangolton-Spemian classical experiments of transplanting epidermis from one part of a bird
1231920	1236400	to another part of the bird and observing that the appendages formed by epidermis
1237040	1244800	are entirely defined by the underlying dermal structure, which is underlying mesenchym.
1245680	1253680	And from that came the notion that mesenchym has some information about the map of the body,
1253680	1259760	which we now is encoded by Hofstein's, and that the epidermis or epithelium has several
1259760	1263840	features, is in this case, forming different kinds of appendages, feathers of different
1263840	1271040	sorts of scales, and that's dictated by mesenchym. So now we take that. So here we're talking as
1271040	1277200	biologists, mesenchym at the dermis feathers, and we abstract from that and say, okay, we have one
1277200	1284320	type of cell, let's call it M cell, doesn't have to be mesenchym. We have another type of cell,
1284320	1290320	let's call it E cell, doesn't have to be epithelial. And we define this as categories based on the
1290320	1295440	relation between them. And the relation is as follows. M cell has some information,
1296160	1302160	in one instance, positional information. E cell has some fake choices. In one instance,
1302160	1307840	this would be feathers and things like that. And M cell dictates the fake choice of E cell.
1308640	1314640	And this we can generalize them and sell that these are definitions of these two categories of
1314640	1321200	cell that are based on the relation between them. And now we don't have to be attached to dermals,
1321200	1326560	feathers, scales and things like that. Now we can say there are two categories of cell.
1327120	1334080	And in addition to dermal and epidermal, as a relation between M and E, we can have other types
1334080	1339840	of biological scenarios. For example, M cell could be niche cell and E cell could be stem cell,
1339840	1345360	because they also have the same relation. Niche cell defining fake choices of stem cells,
1345360	1350640	cell renewal differentiation and so forth. Then we have a relation in immunology between
1350640	1356400	the grid cell and T cells. So the grid cell have some information about what kind of pathogen
1356400	1363520	they encounter. Naive T cells, which is T cells that haven't been yet encountered any signals,
1364400	1369200	they have fake choices. They can become different types of effector cells, memory cells,
1369200	1374640	so forth. What dictates that fake choice signals produced by dendritic cells? Because dendritic
1374640	1379520	cells have that information, in this case it's not positional information, but information they
1379520	1385520	receive from encountering pathogens. And more generally, we can say for any control circuit,
1385520	1390560	including homeostatic control circuit, sensors and effectors are two types of the circuit that
1390560	1396400	where sensors has some information about whatever it monitors. And the effector can do something
1396400	1404960	about it. It has some choices. Thermostat and AC, for example, like thermosensor knows what
1405600	1411440	temperature is. AC has options to increase or decrease, to turn on and off and so forth.
1411440	1417600	Same with beta cell and liver, beta cell knows what glucose concentration liver knows what to do
1417600	1424960	about it. When beta cell tells it what to do through insulin. So this is a general relation.
1424960	1428640	What are other possible types of relation? I'm not going to dwell on many of them, but I will
1428640	1435760	just mention one or two more. So the second type is a functional relation. And this relates to a
1435760	1442560	more familiar notion of division of labor. So here we have a classical textbook division of labor,
1442560	1447440	when two cells are specialized on performing two different functions, A and B, independently of
1447440	1454000	each other. The second type of relation would be division of labor, would be when two cells
1454320	1459440	both contribute to the same function. And if you remove either of them, there is no function.
1460880	1467280	So modern neuron and skeletal muscle form the motor unit, and you need both types of cells to
1467280	1472720	have that function of movement. So they are functionally complementary. So that's that's
1472720	1477600	now a type of relation. Here we can say this is also a relation, but it's a null relation.
1478480	1483280	Here it's a complementary functional complementarity. The third type of relation that hasn't
1483280	1489440	been described in literature, but I think is equally important, is a relation when one cell
1489440	1495440	type is specialized on a particular function. Another cell type is fully dedicated just
1495440	1500640	supporting the function of the other cell. So example would be, for example, again,
1500640	1507920	this could be modern neuron, and the supporting cell would be Schwann cell. So the whole purpose
1507920	1512880	of life for Schwann cell is to support function of the neuron. Neuron is the one that performs
1512880	1520400	primary function. Schwann cell just helps it to perform it better. There are neurons without
1520400	1524240	Schwann cells. There are no Schwann cells without neurons. Schwann cell doesn't have meaning outside
1524240	1529840	of the neuron. It's like a gold player and caddy. We can play both without a caddy, but caddy without
1529840	1535920	a gold player makes no sense. And that's what how some cells are, a pericyte and the trivial cell,
1535920	1541520	the same example and so forth. So there are many cell types, particularly in more complex
1541600	1546960	metazones, that are of this type where they perform supportive functions,
1547840	1552240	and then other cell types perform primary functions. So here we have, again, a relation.
1553200	1566640	It's like somebody who has, let's say, servants, like cooks and drivers, cleaners.
1567600	1573840	There is that type of relation. So what happens is that the driver, cleaner and cook, in this case,
1573840	1579680	are defined by their relation to whoever they serve. And what that also illustrates is the way
1579680	1586800	that this type of relation evolves is that when this cell type gets more and more specialized on
1586800	1592800	a particular function, what it means that when you specialize on something, it means you do
1593760	1599360	fewer things better and better, right? Fewer and fewer things better and better. If you are like a
1600080	1608080	famous, whatever, piano player and you don't have time to clean and shop and do chores,
1608080	1612080	you hire people who do that for you. But what it means you delegate some of the functions
1613360	1618480	to supporting staff, supporting cells. So neuron delegates a lot of functions to
1618480	1623040	bleed your cells, for example. And the same is true for all the other primary cell types.
1624240	1627760	They can be bothered to perform the same functions if you expect them to be
1630800	1636160	optimal at performing one function. That's what happens with humans. Also, of course, we get
1636160	1644640	progressively more specialized. And in the process of that, we delegate some of the functions to
1644640	1648320	other cells. And that in itself raises an interesting question. What can you delegate?
1650400	1656160	So, obviously, you can delegate functions that are not cell autonomous, but you cannot
1656160	1662560	delegate cell autonomous functions. You can delegate cooking to somebody you hire to cook for
1662560	1668240	you, but you cannot delegate eating, right? So certain types of functions are delegated and
1668240	1673600	these are non cell autonomous functions. And the genes that perform these functions can now
1673600	1677920	be expressed in cells that are supporting the performance support function. And that's what
1677920	1683680	seen in gene expression profiles and tissue specific characteristics of cells that are
1683680	1690160	ubiquitous in tissues like macrophages and so forth. So these are some other examples. I'm not
1690160	1694480	going to go through all of them, but these are some other examples of cell relations
1696240	1702400	that we can think of. This can be already mentioned, instructive relation, functional
1702400	1709200	relations, then there could be supply consumer relation, hierarchical relations, and there
1709200	1715440	could be also relations based on mutual exclusivity. For example, if cell A is present somewhere,
1715440	1722400	it's never in a company of cell B. These are mutually excluded. We don't know, I mean,
1722400	1729840	the examples like this exist, but we don't know if these are, they need to be defined in a more
1729840	1737520	strict way. This is more for, for illustration purposes here. Okay, so from here, we can now
1737520	1744160	go back to this picture we had before. And now we can look at a very different light. We can say,
1744160	1750960	okay, what do we have here? We have these various types of cells. They're not all equally important
1750960	1755600	because you can remove some of the cells and tissue will retain its architecture. You can
1755680	1760720	remove T cells and you lose some functionalities, but you still have the same tissue architecture.
1760720	1767840	You remove fibroglas and it collapses. So they are unequal in that regard. And what that means
1767840	1772480	is that some cells are more important than others for tissue architecture. They all have
1772480	1776560	their distinct functionalities, but in terms of tissue architecture, they are not equal.
1778000	1783440	And that raises the question, which ones are the most important ones? And so we can also now
1783440	1787680	look at it from the perspective in structural relations, functional relations, and so on. So
1787680	1795200	now instead of being concerned with cell shapes and whatever, transcriptomics, proteomics, these
1795200	1802000	sort of things, we can label them as different, different categories and the patterns would
1802000	1807680	start emerging, right? And so if you imagine them just as little circles, it is different colors.
1808240	1813920	And we defined relations between colors. So the colors will represent categories.
1815520	1823040	And so if we start thinking about what are the most fundamental categories and what are the most
1824000	1828400	important, important cell types for tissue architecture, for organization of tissues,
1828400	1834560	not for functionalities, for organization of tissues. As I mentioned in the very beginning
1834560	1841120	of MetaZone Life, it was a bacterial mesenchymal unit with the basement membrane in between,
1841120	1847040	and that's what led to the diversification of various types of organization. In vertebrates,
1847040	1852480	I think we have a minimal tissue unit that is based on that original theme,
1853360	1860800	and that minimal unit consists of four types of cells or four categories. Three of them correspond
1860880	1868000	to types usually for most organs, but these are categories. So we have a category of a tissue
1868000	1873840	specific cell that is responsible for core tissue function. This is the cell type responsible for
1873840	1879840	the primary function of the tissue. In the brain, it would be neuron, in the gut, it would be gut
1879840	1886640	epithelium, and so forth. And then we always have three additional cell types that are nearly
1886720	1891680	universally present in all tissues, and that includes, of course, microvascular endothelium.
1892480	1898240	It includes stromal cell, fibroblast-like cells, and it includes tissue resin macrophage.
1898880	1905200	So these three correspond to cell types performing supportive functions. So now we define this
1905200	1911200	minimal unit based on relation between these supportive cell types that are universal in
1911200	1917040	every tissue and tissue-specific primary cell type that obviously perform these different
1917040	1923600	different tissues because it performs tissue-specific primary functions. Now in the gut, we have,
1923600	1928000	let's say, intestinal epithelium, then we have these three cell types. They are not involved in the
1928000	1932560	primary function of the gut, which is digestion absorption, but without these cell types, of
1932560	1938640	course, epithelial cells cannot perform that function. In the brain, we have neurons and
1938640	1943680	glial cells, the same idea. So these supportive cell types are always there to
1946560	1952720	support the function of the client cell. So we can call this a client cell by analogy with
1952720	1959280	chaperones. And so then what we have is that client cells delegate some of the functions to
1959280	1964720	supportive cell types, and some delegated functions need to be performed all the time
1964720	1971120	constitutionally, and this become tissue-resident cells. But some functions only need to be performed
1971120	1978480	on demand. And these are delegated to cells that are not resident in the tissue, but can be recruited
1978480	1985200	to the tissue. And this is the case for vertebrates, or any animal is plus circulation. And that would
1985200	1990400	be the case of inflammatory cells. So neutrophils, you only need them when there is an infection,
1991360	1996000	whereas macrophage, you need in tissue all the time, because macrophages have many jobs.
1996000	2001280	They're like butlers. They can do a lot of things. But when there is a really big problem,
2001280	2009360	you need specialists, and there would be neutrophils. And so then we can think of the way that the
2009360	2016080	biological development of tissue architecture goes from this base case, which is what the
2016080	2023040	beginning of animal life history, as well as the beginning of any animal during development,
2023040	2029280	embryonic development, starts with a pithelium, then generate mesenchymal by EMT, and then from
2029280	2034960	there you go through this process of instructive relations and generate all kinds of tissues.
2034960	2042320	But the derived case that is universal theme now for vertebrate architecture organization,
2042320	2046320	this is only talking about compositional organization, not spatial organization.
2047200	2052640	The general theme would be that you always have the primary cell type, which is the primary
2052640	2059200	function of tissue, it's tissue specific and three supportive cell types. And that's what we can think
2059200	2069840	of as a first approximation. This is of course in very broad strokes. And this is only thinking
2069840	2075920	about the compositional organization of tissue, not structural. But even from that perspective,
2075920	2083280	there are many deep questions one can ask. We don't know the answers to most of them,
2083280	2091360	but mostly I would say because the questions have not been asked that way. So one has to do with
2091360	2100400	one of my big interests for me is understanding biology of cell communication and particularly
2100400	2108960	biology of growth act. So every cell in the animal, every normal cell that is not cancerous cell
2109600	2114880	requires specific growth factors to stay alive and to be present in the tissue.
2115280	2121520	The cells that don't have their specific growth factor will die by default. So cell composition
2121520	2127680	of tissue is dictated by local availability of these linear restricted growth factors for macrophage
2127680	2135600	to be CSF1 from fibroblast PDG of beta and so forth. In the telial cells, whether they're
2135600	2140240	GMF and other angiogenic factors, and the cell will have different growth factors depending
2140240	2147120	on what the identity is. So then the question becomes that the cell composition, because it's
2147120	2155920	a function of local availability of specific growth factors, what kind of cell in what amounts,
2155920	2162720	in what location you will have in the tissue is entirely dictated by local provisional growth
2162720	2168720	factor in particular place in particular amounts. So then the question then becomes what are the
2168720	2174240	rules and mechanisms that ensure production of appropriate growth factors in the right amounts
2174240	2180160	in the right places. And that, because we don't know those rules, I think that that provides a
2180160	2188160	major, major conceptual gap in our understanding of development and tissue biology. So we're
2188160	2194880	interested in this question and this is of course, this is not one set of rule, it needs a systematic
2194880	2201440	study and of course in the lab we can only do, you know, proof of concept studies. So the question
2201440	2207200	is as follows. So the growth factors of that type, the type that are called linear restricted
2207200	2214160	growth factors that are necessary for each cell to survive. Production of these growth factors is
2214160	2221760	typically the source of them is another cell type. If this is growth factor for cell Y,
2222320	2227840	it's typically produced by cell X, which is a different cell type. So cell X makes growth
2227840	2233040	factor for cell Y and the amount of that growth factor determines the number of cell Y is where
2233040	2239680	they are location, because these growth factors typically have small diffusion radius, and they
2239680	2246800	are often deposited on ECM. And then question becomes how does these cells, cell X knows which
2246880	2252400	growth factor to make and how much to make. Okay, we can say well, which growth factor to make
2252400	2259040	could be hard wires, it could be part of the identity that if you sell X, you program to make
2259040	2265440	growth factor for cell Y, that's fair assumption. And there are cases when it is indeed the case
2266080	2271840	that it's produces, it's already knows which growth factor to make. In other cases, it needs to be
2271840	2280800	told. And it can be told by cell Y itself. Cell Y tells it that I need, my identity is Y, and I
2280800	2287360	need growth factor that supports cell Y. And what that communication is like, that's the part that
2287360	2292480	we also interested in understanding, and we still don't know all the details, but we know that there
2292480	2299600	is indeed this type of communication. So the question is what determines this, this
2302080	2306320	controls the appropriate production level. And I'll go through this example very quickly,
2306320	2313360	because it was published, but we use microphase fibroblasts as a case study to as a proof of
2313360	2319760	concept study to characterize in exchange of these two growth factors, which are well defined for
2319760	2325520	these cells, it's CSF1 for macrophage produced by fibroblasts and PDGF for fibroblasts produced by
2325520	2331920	macrophage. And what we found in that study a few years ago is that if we define conditions such that
2331920	2339440	if you take individually the cell type, and don't provide exogenous recombinant growth factors,
2339440	2343680	they will die as expected, each of them will die. But because they can each produce growth
2343680	2348480	factor for the other guy, we ask whether they can support each other under those conditions where
2348480	2354000	there is no external growth factor. And they can indeed, and not only that, they could also
2354000	2363120	reach stable ratio, even if we vary initial ratio by hundredfold, they all convert to stable ratio,
2363120	2369600	which implies that they're not simply feeding each other growth factor that would lead to
2369600	2376560	uncontrolled growth, but rather there is some kind of a circuit design of the exchange of growth
2376640	2383200	factors that results in stability. And indeed, there is a circuit design that results in stability,
2383200	2387440	and it's shown here. So that's what we found both experimentally and through modeling,
2388320	2394800	that the for the two cell types to be stable, one has to be limited by carrying capacity, which is
2395680	2401680	limitation external to the system, just like in ecology, carrying capacity, space, food, and so
2402640	2407360	on. And the other cell type has to be limited, it has to have a negative feedback on a growth
2407360	2412080	factor it receives from the first cell type. And as long as these two conditions are met,
2413280	2419120	you can, you will have a stable system. But these conditions are met only in 24 out of
2419120	2427520	144 total cases of total number of possible cell circuit topologies. Of them only 24 are
2427520	2433440	stable, and all of them have these two conditions met. And this is what it would look like if X1
2433440	2438880	is here would be fibroblast X2 macrophage, this is a phase portrait of the dynamic behavior,
2438880	2444800	we have the same experimental data. And this is the predicted on state, which is what we observe.
2445600	2451440	And as you can see, the system will evolve towards the stable on state, and this is stable
2451440	2456720	off state when there are no cells. But what was interesting in this case, it also, we also found
2456720	2463360	additional on state, stable on state for one cell type for fibroblast, but only when the density
2463360	2469520	of the cell was above some threshold. And in ecology, this type of phenomenon is known as
2469520	2481520	Ali effect. Ali effect means that population will undergo expansion, only if it is above
2481520	2487040	some critical density. So for example, and for penguins, they cannot survive in the
2488960	2495760	wild if there is not enough of them, because they need to huddle to keep each other warm.
2495760	2500160	Pack of wolves, one wolf would not survive because they hunt in packs and things like that.
2500160	2506240	So this is Ali effect. And we see that there is Ali effect in cell ecology as well. And specifically
2506240	2511840	for fibroblasts, it requires if they reach critical density, they now can support each
2511840	2517040	other without macrophage. And the reason for that is this autographed signal. And that signal is
2517040	2525360	provided by PTGF alpha and HBGF. And so that that's what type of scenarios we see that for
2525360	2530800	this is stable observed state. With autographed signal, you have this additional stable state
2530800	2535680	that could be pathological because when you have fibroblasts without macrophage, this is basically
2535680	2542320	the case of fibrosis. So this type of circuit design creates vulnerability for fibrosis.
2543360	2548880	But then there are other designs that we find through computationally, and they presumably
2548880	2557840	exist also amongst cell-cell interactions. In this case, if you don't have autographed signal,
2557840	2566720	you don't have this pathological stable state with cell X1 alone. But on the other hand,
2566720	2573600	so these type of tissues that have the cells with this circuit of interaction will not be
2574480	2579520	vulnerable to fibrosis. But on the other hand, the basin of attraction to the off state is much
2579520	2585040	bigger here, which may suggest that these type of tissues will be vulnerable to degenerative
2585040	2591520	disease instead of fibroly disease. And this is something that we're still exploring. That's
2591520	2598960	indeed the case. So from that, what we find is that there is this relation between cells
2599920	2604400	based on growth factor production that is dictated by critical growth factor topology
2605120	2614000	and that there is a simple requirement for stability that we can define and that this
2614000	2621280	can be generalized to other types of interactions where it's the same topology doesn't. And from that
2621280	2632240	we then wanted to ask the next question, what controls the size of the compartments and tissues?
2634080	2639760	And there are two paradigms that existed side by side for decades. One paradigm for
2639840	2645760	compartmental size control is basically space availability. And that cells, if they have cells
2645760	2651680	to expand to, they will expand. When they don't have space to expand to, they stop expanding.
2651680	2657440	This is contact inhibition in vitro. But in vivo, this would apply to cells that use
2657440	2663280	mechanosensing, for example, to determine when they have to stop dividing. And this type of
2663280	2668880	mechanosensing, for example, famously operates through the hippo pathway. And that paradigm works
2669440	2675360	for these types of tissues. But it would not be applicable to tissues that are not limited by
2675360	2681360	space, like macrophages lymphocytes and a hematopoietic cell. So then the question is what
2681360	2686640	control this compartment size? And that's where second paradigm is applicable. And that is that
2687840	2694160	every cell needs growth active to survive and to proliferate. And if you fix the amount of
2694160	2700240	growth factor to the appropriate level, the cells will expand if there is more growth factor than
2700240	2706240	the cells that it can support. But once they reach that level, further expansion will result
2706240	2711920	cells that now don't have enough growth factor and they will die. And so it's above that level.
2712640	2716880	It will go down. If it's below that level, they will expand. And that's how you can, and that
2718000	2724000	clearly that's how it works for hematopoietic cells. That's well known. You can change the amount
2724000	2730560	of retropoietin, for example, or GCSF while seven and you can control different hematopoietic
2730560	2737040	cell size numbers. But what was striking for us is that these two paradigms applied exactly to the
2737040	2746000	two cell types that we use in our study. And again, if we think from the cell category perspective,
2746800	2754640	we have one category of cell that is limited by one population size control paradigm.
2755520	2760960	And the other cell type that's controlled by another paradigm. And we asked whether this is
2760960	2767120	just purely a lucky coincidence or curious coincidence or if there is some deeper inside
2767120	2774160	here. And specifically, we asked whether, because fibroblast controlled by space availability,
2774160	2778880	so carrying capacity of the environment and microphase by growth factor availability, we asked
2778880	2784880	whether production of growth factor by fibroblast is a function of space availability it can detect.
2785680	2790720	And that's exactly what we found that we, when we looked at fibroblasts growing them at different
2790720	2796640	densities as to mimic space availability, we find there's a number of genes that control
2796640	2803280	in density dependent manner and amongst them growth factors like CSF1 and many others.
2804640	2810400	And so that indicated that CSF1, for example, would be expressed at higher level when cells are at
2811040	2816640	lower density. And as density increases, it will be at lower level. And this way you adjust the
2816640	2822560	numbers of fibroblasts dictated by space availability to the number of macrophages dictated by CSF1
2822560	2828240	availability that they produce as a function of space. I have a quick question. Sorry to interrupt
2828240	2835520	you, but so I know that the ECM plays a large role in growth factor availability. It acts like a
2835520	2842720	sink. It acts as like a release factor. Have you looked at all at, because in cell density, you
2842720	2849360	start to build up a certain amount of ECM as well as the number of cells. Have you looked at whether
2849360	2854960	or not if you co-template with the ECM that these cells would normally lay down,
2854960	2857440	if that would have the same effect as the cell density?
2858880	2866080	Yes, we have. The answer is a bit more kind of involved to you. It's a very important question
2866080	2874160	and we're really interested in understanding how ECM contributes to that. We know that it's a little
2874160	2882800	bit, it will take us a bit far from the main topic here, but what we know is that in the case of
2882800	2891120	macrophage and fibroblast interaction, the exchange of growth factors is cell contact dependent. Moreover,
2892320	2899200	fibroblasts that receive PDGF from macrophage will only receive PDGF from macrophage if it
2899280	2907040	provides that macrophage with CSF1. If we remove CSF1 from half of fibroblasts, mix them with the
2907040	2913600	well-typed ones, give them macrophages in the same system I described. Fibroblasts that don't
2913600	2919920	contribute growth factor do not receive growth factor. It operates in a cell. It's like a
2921760	2927200	gangster movies where you give the drug and the case with drug and case with money and you exchange
2927200	2934480	it like this and you don't just give and trust the other one. It's some kind of a maybe anti-cheater
2935200	2941680	strategy, but it is a direct exchange in these things. There are some other interesting, very
2941680	2949120	interesting scenarios, as you mentioned, because there is a form of CSF1 that is proteoglycan form,
2950000	2959120	but in this case it wasn't a factor. We tried to simplify to look at, with a minimal number of
2959120	2965200	variables, but it is a very important point. There is a mechanosensing by both fibroblasts
2965200	2971200	and macrophages also, a thing that I'm not going to discuss, where we find that macrophages use
2971200	2977600	very fundamentally different mechanosensing strategy compared to fibroblasts or bacterial cells.
2980000	2986560	Sorry, so just to finish this quickly, this part, what we find is that there is a
2988000	2994160	density sensitive enhancer in fibroblasts that controls expression CSF1.
2994880	3001920	And when we perform motif enrichment analysis, we found that that sites were enriched in density
3001920	3006560	sensitive genes and that is DNA binding transcription factor controlled by hippo pathway.
3007040	3012080	And basically we found that hippo pathway controls, through this distant enhancer,
3012080	3018640	controls expression of CSF1 and fibroblasts, but not in other cell types. These enhancers
3018640	3024000	are only active in fibroblasts, and that one indeed is recruited there, it's shown here by
3024720	3030160	chromatin IP, and that's what controls expression of CSF1, leading to this kind of model, where we
3030160	3039120	have homeostatic or density sensitive enhancer in CSF1 gene that is operative in fibroblasts,
3039760	3047040	and it controls homeostatic expression of CSF1, where it adjusts the number of macrophages to
3047040	3056960	number of fibroblasts. What the parameter for the ratio, this is exactly the kind of characteristics
3056960	3062080	that would be dependent on the tissue and properties of ECM and so on. That's where the
3062080	3067280	tuning of this parameter will change this ratio in a tissue specific way, because not every tissue
3067280	3073440	has exact same ratio and doesn't need to or should not have. And then there is this,
3074640	3080560	the inducible enhancer, and that could be dependent on the last expansion of macphage on
3080560	3087280	DMET during infection inflammation and so on. So that's the picture we see with
3089840	3096320	this type of relation of macrophage in fibroblasts establishing appropriate cell numbers,
3097120	3105040	and of course this is just one of the principles. There are many additional, as mentioned, ECM,
3105040	3111200	how they both sense ECM and whether signals is delivered through cell contact, through diffusion,
3111200	3116000	or through deposition on ECM. These will provide important variations on the theme,
3116720	3123280	which need to be individually explored. But what I want to finish here is the notion that there is
3124320	3131840	how this can be generalized, where we have a cell type, for example, fibroblast that senses
3132400	3139440	some aspect of tissue environment, for example, space. That space sensing is coupled, in this case,
3139440	3143600	through hippo pathway, coupled with control of growth factor for another cell type.
3144720	3152320	And because space availability cell numbers, these are characteristics of tissue homoesthetic
3152320	3159520	variables, here we just have this simple type of relation unrelated to function, because space
3160480	3165440	availability is not related to function of macrophage. But then we have other types of
3165440	3171680	relations where it is related to function. So, for example, sensing oxygen availability in other
3172400	3178720	environmental factor in tissues now sends through heat one pathway, and negatively regulates
3178720	3184000	expression of that gap, which is a growth factor for endothelial cell. Now, endothelial cell
3184000	3189920	functionally is related to oxygen availability. So, if oxygen level is low, if derepressed,
3190560	3198080	undiogenesis occurs, oxygen delivered, and oxygen level goes back to normal. And that type of relation
3198080	3205200	now can be expanded as I will elaborate in the next slide. But there are additional types,
3205200	3211040	so this raises the question of what are aspects of tissue environment that are sense, all the aspects
3211040	3217600	of tissue environment that are sense in a way that translates into control of specific growth
3217600	3225440	factor production. And how that, because each growth factor controls specific cell types,
3226320	3233600	how the cell type is related to this factor that is sensed, that controls production.
3233600	3239520	And that, I think, what defines the rules. It's one set of rules, it's not all rules,
3239520	3243280	but it's one set of rules that defines how growth factor expression is regulated.
3244240	3251200	So, here we have the homeostatic control, which is unrelated to this functional role of the cells.
3251200	3255360	It's just, it's calibrated. You always need enough macrophages. So, it's calibrated on the
3255360	3261200	pollution time scale. You always need this many, you know, this ratio, this percentage of macrophages.
3262160	3267120	But then, in addition, you can have expansion on demand. If there's infection need more macrophages,
3267120	3272880	so this growth factor will go up. If you have hypoxia, you will need more endothelial cells,
3272880	3279440	this growth factor will go up. If there is this X, some other environmental factor of tissue,
3279440	3285680	you need more of cell X, and you produce growth factor for cell X. And then, when we looked at
3288480	3294000	imposing different kind of perturbations on cell to mimic these deviations in tissue environment.
3294000	3301280	So, we used hypoxia, glucose deprivation, I mean acid deprivation, ER stress, osmotic stress,
3301280	3307760	and so forth, oxidative stress. And then, looked at the expression of genes and fibrolysis, and we
3307760	3315440	find a whole range of growth factors are regulated by these perturbations, which brings up the
3315440	3321360	possibility of exploring what the logic is in each individual case, because for each growth factor,
3321360	3326160	there is a corresponding cell type that's controlled by it. Often, for even perturbation,
3326160	3331200	you will need more than one cell type, of course, and that's why you will see that some of them induce
3332640	3337200	most of them induce more than one growth factor. So, sensing of the environment by one cell type
3337200	3342560	is linked to control population size of another cell type that is functionally related to whatever
3342560	3349200	that environmental perturbation reflects. And so, to generalize this, we can say it acts as
3349200	3355360	anything that determines the requirement for Y. Let's say there is a lot of, I don't know,
3355360	3361600	garbage, you need more genitors, right? And then you have a sensor that determines that there is
3361600	3367920	a lot of garbage. So, that would be the cell that determines that X is there, and therefore,
3367920	3374000	you need Y to take care of X. If it's hypoxia, you need endothelial smells. If it's infection,
3374080	3383280	you need neutrophil. If it's some kind of other type of perturbation, you need a particular
3383280	3390960	cell type. And then, the way that it operates is what I call functional demand. So, in this case,
3390960	3398960	what the underlying logic is that if X is detected, that means there is a demand for the function of
3398960	3406320	the cell Y that can take care of X. So, this is a sensing of functional demand
3407280	3413680	by cell X. So, it sends demand for function of cell Y, produces growth factor for cell Y,
3413680	3419520	cell Y expands, performs the function, functional demand is eliminated, and it goes back to steady
3419520	3427440	state. And in this fashion, cell X knows which growth factor to make. Remember the question of
3427440	3431840	identity, how do cells know which growth factor? It knows which growth factor, and it knows how
3431840	3437680	much to make. It depends on how much of functional demand there is. And it doesn't have to be only
3437680	3444400	growth factor. It could be any signal that can fulfill this circuit. It could be an expansion
3444400	3449840	of the cells, but it could also be a recruitment, or it could be activation of the function Y
3449840	3455680	that will remove that demand. And that now goes to a more general type of control circuits that
3455680	3461040	operate also in physiological settings and so forth. But for growth factor production, I think
3461040	3471280	that's what determines their functionality. Okay, so I will, instead of continuing in the same way,
3471280	3476160	in what I will do, I wanted to finish with something very different, not different, but
3476720	3486000	with notions related to what I started with, thinking about what I talked about most of my
3486000	3493840	talk is about examples of approaching these questions of tissue, social organization of tissues,
3494880	3500320	social lives of cells from the perspective of trying to look for underlying principles and rules.
3501120	3507520	And of course, as you all know, this is the general sort of strategy and general
3507520	3513920	paradigm and complex systems where you have multiple agents that interact with each other,
3514480	3520720	according to some rules, and that generates, generates, there is
3521600	3530160	emerging properties that are consequences of these interactions. And of course,
3530160	3534640	then the pictures like this that are emerging properties of interactions from agents,
3534640	3544400	patient or births, these are the observables. And the observables often fascinating, but
3544400	3549600	understanding them from the perspective that would be the first instinct to understand them,
3549600	3554480	to describe the size, the number of fish and what they're thinking, what they, you know,
3554480	3560640	what their glucose level is, measuring their RNA expression levels and proteomics and so forth.
3561680	3567120	These are going to be totally useless to understanding how you form this type of structures.
3568240	3572880	And instead, we need to understand what are the rules that generated them.
3573840	3579680	But again, what we're dealing with is these observables. And I made this very kind of a toy
3579680	3586640	example to illustrate something that I think for you would be very familiar intellectually,
3587440	3593600	that let's say this is the observable, this is what you see in microscope or through some other
3593600	3600240	type of experiment. And you try to understand how is this generated. This is some kind of a
3600240	3606240	structure you see it could be some arrangement of cells in the tissue or whatnot. And of course,
3606240	3611840	this would be very misleading if you tried to kind of use your immediate instinct to think that
3611840	3621360	there is something that generated curve structure. Right. Then if we know that actually, it's part
3621360	3627040	of this structure is just that you can see there are four repeated units and three of them are
3627680	3634320	black. And you cannot see them, or three of them are made up by cells that died in the as a part of
3634320	3641840	the developmental program. And you left only with this one on the left. And but in reality,
3641840	3646640	it's actually symmetrical structure. Not only it's curved by cement, but it's still curved. So
3646640	3651840	you're still thinking, well, how do you generate curve structure? And then we add mask, additional
3651840	3657120	layer. And now we look here. And now we see that these are actually
3659680	3666320	curve structure. Now we the white stripes become visible. And once they are visible, now we see,
3666320	3674400	oh, this is just slightly skewed hexagon. And we know exactly how to make a hexagon. And this is
3674400	3683520	just one line of code to say, you know, draw hexagon and instead of instead of 120 degrees,
3683520	3690240	you turn by 121 degrees. And now it's slightly skewed, and you iterate that and you get curve
3690240	3696160	structure. And if you remove some parts of it and end up with what's on the left, then there is no
3696160	3702720	way to tell how you made it. So the point being that the rule to generate this is very simple rule.
3703440	3710640	Just drawing hexagon and slightly skewing the angle. As a result, you have this spiral
3710640	3715760	lock structures, then you remove parts of them and you can have a curve. And if you look at the
3715760	3722960	curve, there's it's very hard to tell if not impossible to tell how it was generated. And
3722960	3731680	so what we deal with often is these observables, which which are several steps removed from the
3731680	3738640	rules that generated them. The rules themselves are extremely simple. But the observable, the curve
3738640	3743920	is emergent property here, usually, but how it generates them. And we can see that more clearly
3743920	3748400	with some cell automata types of examples, where you look at this final structure here,
3749040	3754720	and you try to understand how it was generated. It's hard to tell by looking at it, but that's
3754720	3761520	the observable. Now, if you look at it carefully, you start seeing, well, there is some symmetry here.
3762480	3768320	And if you look at symmetry, you apply coarse-graining and see that, well, this unit
3768320	3773200	actually repeated four times this one. In this unit, you also start seeing symmetry. It's also
3773200	3778400	repeated four times in this structure, then it's repeated four times in this structure. And that
3778400	3784720	is generated by these types of rules. So these are two rules. I mean, these are completely randomly
3784720	3789360	chosen just for illustration purposes to say that these are the rules that generate this.
3789360	3797600	The way they generate is through iteration and based on local information only and based on
3797600	3803680	only information available at the time of execution of the rules. You don't need to have
3803680	3808720	memory. You don't need to have global information. But the point is that if we know the rules,
3808720	3814320	of course, we can generate easily these structures. And we understand them completely when we know
3814320	3819040	the rules. But if you go the other way, which is the way we're usually forced to go because
3819040	3824160	what's observable is going from the other end, we have this structure. We try to understand the rule
3824160	3834560	and we can't because we don't know. There are no universal methods to do so. So we have to,
3835280	3840160	instead of characterizing more and more detail, what that is, we try to figure out what are the
3840160	3845760	original structures that generated them. And this is what basically
3847760	3852400	point that what we need to understand is what are the rules of interaction.
3854400	3860720	And of course, then there are many fascinating questions about specific mechanisms, pathways
3860720	3868400	and so forth. But if we simplify it down to the bare minimum, if you think about what cells can do,
3868480	3876320	cells can do five things. They can do nothing. So that's an identity operation. They can die,
3876320	3883200	they can copy, they can change identity, and they can change location. I'm sorry,
3883760	3888240	set identity twice, I meant it in different ways. This is cell identity and this is identity
3888240	3896480	operation, meaning that it's a, it's unity. It's doing nothing. So these are five things
3896480	3901520	that cells can do. There's nothing else. Everything is variation on these five things. Of course,
3901520	3909520	most variations comes from changing identity, which is cell state, cell type, and so forth.
3911120	3918000	But ultimately, this is, everything is a combination of these five actions. And this first action,
3918080	3925600	do nothing, is also an active action because you don't just stay as you are. You often, well,
3925600	3931840	a cell always needs a signal that tells it to stay as you are. Don't die, don't proliferate,
3931840	3937920	don't move. It's also an active process. So for each of these, there is a corresponding
3937920	3945360	types of signals that tell them do A, B, C, D, or E. And so now if you think of all the language
3945440	3953680	of cell communication, all the words that cells can hear and utter, all of them, we can say, can
3954880	3963520	fall into five categories, whether they tell cells to do A, B, C, D, or E. And that is sort
3963520	3972560	of the direction we are going in our thinking of defining the language based on, of course,
3972640	3978000	the interpretation of different signals also depends on the function of the state. It's not
3978000	3984400	just that a particular biochemical signal always means A or B. It also depends on cell state,
3984400	3990560	just like in any communication. And those are the very basic and general sort of description of
3990560	4002400	the types of rules we are seeking to find. So I'll stop here and take any questions. Thank you.
