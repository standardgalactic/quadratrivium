0	7400	Okay, so it's a great pleasure today for me to introduce Professor Michael Levin.
7400	13360	He's a distinguished professor at Tufts University, as well as the Vannevar Bush professor.
13360	19520	And he's also director of the Allen Discovery Center and the Tufts Center for Regenerative
19520	23080	and Developmental Biology.
23080	31920	And I'm sure everyone here have heard about his work on Xenobots, which I've been told
31920	34320	there'll be some of that at the end of his talks.
34320	42440	So Michael has requested that we refrain from asking deep questions until the end.
42440	46000	So just clarification questions throughout the talk so that we can get to the really
46000	47400	exciting parts.
47400	51200	Okay, so take it away.
51200	52200	Thank you.
52200	53200	Thank you so much.
53200	57960	And thank you for having me and giving me the opportunity to share some ideas with you.
57960	63120	All of the details and if you would like to contact me, which would be great, you can
63120	65800	find me at these two websites.
65800	71560	So what I want to talk about today is our sort of perspective on collective intelligence
71560	75840	and in particular cellular behavior as a kind of collective intelligence.
75840	82760	So I often start by thinking about Alan Turing, who of course needs no introduction, was very
82760	89480	interested in intelligence, in cognition and various embodiments, and in particular in
89480	96240	problem-solving machines, this idea that intelligence can be manifest through plasticity or reprogrammability.
96240	98800	And so we all know that.
98800	103600	Some people may or may not know that he was also interested in morphogenesis, the generation
103600	105760	of biological shape.
105760	109880	And it's often, one might wonder, why would the same person who was interested in intelligence
109880	115640	be interested in the kinds of questions that biologists tend to, developmental biologists
115640	117640	in particular tend to deal with.
117640	123640	And I think he saw a very deep symmetry between these two fields, which is, I think, very
123640	128840	important and still not really appreciated sufficiently.
128840	130400	So this is what we work on.
130400	134000	In particular, the idea of problem-solving living machines.
134000	139200	And one thing that we have to think about as we drill down in the biology and we look
139200	145440	to see what we are all made of is this idea that this traditional distinction between,
145440	150760	we look at things like termite mounds and bee colonies and blard flocks and we say, okay,
150760	156880	that's perhaps a kind of collective intelligence, but we are true sort of centralized intelligences.
156880	163040	And of course, the idea is that actually all intelligence, certainly in biology as well
163040	167640	as collective intelligence, because we are all made of parts and components.
167640	171800	And in fact, the Ambricard Sole calls this kind of thing a liquid brain in the sense
171800	176480	that the components are not fixed with respect to their spatial relationships.
176480	179120	So this is the sort of thing of which we are made.
179120	180440	This is a single cell.
180440	181440	This is called a lacrimaria.
181440	186200	Of course, this is a free-living organism.
186200	187200	It's one cell.
187200	188200	It has no brain.
188200	189720	It has no nervous system.
189720	195000	It is extremely competent in its local sort of environment with its local goals.
195000	196000	So it's physiological.
196000	197000	It's anatomical.
197000	198600	It's behavioral goals.
198600	203880	It's very competent without the typical things that we associate with intelligence.
203880	210520	And the really critical part is to realize is that all of us make this amazing journey
210520	214440	from what people call just physics to cognition.
214440	221280	So we were all at one point a quiescent oocyte, so a little pile of chemicals doing something
221280	225480	like this where specific molecules interact with other molecules.
225480	229400	But eventually, through this process of embryonic development, we become something like this
229400	231560	or maybe even something like that.
231560	236440	And so the thing about this process is that it's extremely slow and gradual.
236440	241960	There is no special point at which a magic lightning flash sort of says, okay, now you
241960	242960	are cognitive.
242960	243960	Before that, you were just physics.
243960	246080	In chemistry, now you are a true cognitive individual.
246080	247080	That doesn't happen.
247080	249560	So we need to understand this scale up.
249560	254200	We need to understand what happens from the time that we are this to the time that we
254200	255200	are that.
255200	261420	So the main points today that I would like to talk about is this idea of biology's multi-scale
261420	266520	competency architecture, which is a set of nested problem solvers in different spaces.
266520	270600	And one kind of invariant to all of this is navigation.
270600	275720	I want to spend the most of my time on this example, although there are many other examples,
275720	279680	of anatomical control and specifically this idea of navigating morpho space.
279680	286280	And I will talk a lot about bioelectrical networks as not only the mediator of kind
286280	294080	of the coagum, the glue that binds the neurons together into a coherent emergent intelligence,
294080	298000	but also of a much more ancient roles for that same mechanism.
298000	301840	And this has many applications, for example, on biomedicine.
301840	306320	And at the end, I want to talk a little bit about synthetic bioengineering.
306320	310440	I want to show you some novel creatures that have never existed before and talk a little
310440	314720	bit about what this means for evolution and for many other fields.
314720	319200	So single cells come in all shapes and sizes.
319200	320200	This is a single cell.
320200	321200	So this is a diatom.
321200	322200	They are very tiny.
322200	323760	So this is a single cell.
323760	325000	This is also a single cell.
325000	329840	This thing, which looks like a plant, it has a nice cap and a stalk and some roots here.
329840	334200	It's actually an alga, the whole thing could be up to 10 centimeters in size.
334200	335680	It's also a single cell.
335680	340800	So if you're interested in morphogenesis by differentiating cells into different types,
340800	344680	we already start to see that there's structure well below that.
344680	350840	This thing has one nucleus and it manages to make this amazing shape without any differentiation.
350840	353320	Cells are also competent in behavioral spaces.
353320	357360	So what you're looking at here, this is a slime mold called physarum polycephalum.
357360	359920	It has many nuclei, but it's still one cell.
359920	361560	The whole thing is one cell.
361560	363520	And what you can do is you can do this.
363520	365360	You can put some objects in its vicinity.
365360	367280	These white things are glass discs.
367280	369240	They have no chemical on them, no food, nothing.
369240	370640	They're completely inert.
370640	376240	And if you put three on one side and one on the other, it will consistently choose to
376240	377640	travel towards the three.
377640	382680	What it's actually doing as we showed in this paper is it's actually sensing strain angle
382680	383680	in the medium.
383680	385480	It is incredibly sensitive to it.
385480	389520	And it's pulsing, which you can't see here, but it's pulsing as a kind of sonar to build
389520	393640	a map of its surroundings and migrate towards the heavier object.
393640	397480	And what's kind of cool is that at this point here, for the first four hours, it sort of
397480	399840	grows in all directions.
399840	404400	And this is the point at which it's got enough information and now, boom, now it knows where
404400	405560	to go at that point.
405560	409000	But right here, you still can't really, you don't really know.
409000	411440	But at this point, bang, it starts to.
411440	415560	So there are all sorts of, so this is kind of the field of basal cognition and trying
415560	421520	to understand how biology was solving various problems long before brains and neurons appeared.
421520	424920	So I want to talk about three or four things today.
424920	429880	The first thing I want to do is I want to twist some knobs on traditional cognitive
429880	438040	science and talk about some unconventional agents that we can start thinking about.
438040	445520	So this kind of picture, this is the classic painting of Adam naming the animals in the
445520	447280	Garden of Eden.
447280	452400	This kind of picture is really pretty prevalent in a lot of discussions, in the sense that
452400	460280	people really think about finished adult organisms as the subjects of their study.
460280	464520	So intelligence, they say the human brain or the rat or something like this.
464520	468760	And what I want to do is stretch this in a number of dimensions, both in terms of the
468760	476000	time evolution, the fact that everything comes from one cell at one point, and also the fact
476000	481280	that drawing boundaries between different types of creatures is actually very difficult
481280	485520	because of the interoperability of life and the ability to make chimeras.
485520	487400	So the first thing we can think about is this.
487400	489360	This is a caterpillar.
489360	493560	This is a kind of soft-bodied robot that crawls around and it chews plants and it lives in
493560	495440	a two-dimensional world.
495440	497080	It has to turn into this.
497080	503120	This is a completely different hard-bodied kind of creature which has to fly in a three-dimensional
503120	504120	world.
504120	506560	It doesn't care about leaves anymore, but it does want nectar.
506560	511480	And so the behavioral and all of these repertoires are completely different.
511480	516120	So during this time, what happens is the brain basically liquefies.
516120	517920	Most of the connections are broken.
517920	519360	Most of the neurons die.
519360	523920	It gets reassembled and rebuilt into a brand new brain suitable for driving, this kind
523920	525320	of creature.
525320	529000	And one of the most amazing things is, and there are many examples that you can read
529000	535040	about here, is that if you train this animal to have particular memories, those memories
535040	537720	are recovered in the moth or butterfly that comes out.
537720	542420	So despite the complete rewiring of the brain here, those memories remain.
542420	545920	So as computer scientists, we can start thinking about, okay, what kind of medium could we
545920	554000	have that is able to store information that survives radical remodeling of the structure
554000	555000	of the medium.
555000	560560	But this metamorphosis is very interesting because this is not just evolutionary timescales.
560560	562160	This is a single individual.
562160	566480	So if you're into philosophy of mind and you wonder what's it like to be a caterpillar
566480	569480	or a butterfly, here's kind of the next level question.
569480	572800	What's it like to be a caterpillar turning into a butterfly?
573480	578880	What is the experience of this process as your cognitive medium is being completely reshaped?
578880	580640	Biology goes even further.
580640	581640	These are plenaria.
581640	582640	These are flatworms.
582640	585120	You'll hear lots more about them later.
585120	587400	Interesting thing about them, well, several interesting things.
587400	591560	One is that you can cut them into pieces and every piece regenerates and becomes a completely
591560	592840	normal worm.
592840	596640	But what you could, and so they have a true brain, all the same neurotransmitters that
596640	600480	you and I have centralized nervous system.
600480	605560	What you can do is you can train them to expect food on these little laser-etched kind of
605560	609000	a bumpy surfaces, cut off their heads.
609000	613920	The tail sits there doing nothing for about 10 days and then they regrow a brand new brain
613920	618080	and then you find out that the animal actually remembers where to find the food.
618080	620840	So the memory survives complete decapitation.
620840	625160	So the interesting thing about that is, okay, somehow it's stored in the rest of the tissue,
625160	627960	maybe neural, maybe not neural, we don't know, fine.
627960	634040	But also that information has to be imprinted onto the new brain that is constructed from
634040	635040	scratch.
635040	642360	So this idea of moving information around and what happens to cognitive information as
642360	645400	anatomical information is being processed is really interesting, right?
645400	648280	That's the nexus at which we do most of our work.
648280	651040	And so now, finally, I want to show you an example.
651040	656560	This bears on some of the evolutionary topics where this is a tadpole of a frog.
656560	660160	So here are the nostrils, here's the mouth, here's the brain, here's the gut, here's the
660160	661160	tail.
661160	664680	Now you'll notice something very strange is that here with the eyes should be here, but
664680	665680	they're missing.
665680	666680	Instead, there's one on the tail.
666680	669600	And we engineered it this way and I can talk later about how that's done.
669600	673760	But the interesting thing is that when you make a tadpole with an eye on its tail, despite
673760	678720	the fact that for millions of years, everything was perfectly set up to expect visual input
678720	683120	from two regions right here into the optic tectum, these animals can see quite well.
683120	688200	So we can do a tadpole, we made a machine that tests their learning and visual assays.
688200	691240	This eye, in fact, makes an optic nerve.
691240	693840	It synapses on the spinal cord, not on the brain.
693840	698120	And that apparently is sufficient for the brain to recognize this.
698120	703320	So you can imagine this weird sort of information bus onto which this organ is putting some
703320	706320	sort of data and the brain says, oh yes, I know what that is.
706320	709760	That's visual data, even though it's coming in from a completely bizarre location.
709760	711200	No problem, right?
711200	717160	So that kind of plasticity is going to be a major, major theme today because one of
717160	723360	the things that I think is a constant theme in biology is that it does not over-train
723360	730720	on priors, meaning that it plays the hands that it's dealt at any given moment.
730720	738160	What evolution is making is hardware that is very good at dealing with a novelty because
738160	743240	it doesn't actually have exact expectations and we'll get to some of that later.
743240	747120	So the interesting thing, what I think makes all of that work, which of course is very
747120	751280	challenging, we're still struggling to make technology like that, what makes all of this
751280	758440	work is this multi-scale competency architecture where not only is biology nested dolls kind
758440	761080	of at the structural level, that's obvious, everybody knows that.
761080	767760	But actually, not only functionally but computationally, every level is solving different problems
767760	769360	in their own space.
769360	775120	And so I've been working on a framework, which I don't have time to really get into the details,
775120	780880	but if anybody's interested, I can give you a link, that is going to enable us to think
780880	785640	about very diverse intelligences, not only the kinds of things that people typically
785640	791080	think about, but also to weird creatures, colonial swarms and bacterial mats and engineered
791080	796160	new life forms and AIs and maybe alien life forms, whatever.
796160	803200	And it's based in part on this kind of approach where, and this is from an old paper in the
803200	809720	40s about setting up a scale of cognitive sophistication all the way from very simple
809720	815240	to quite advanced, with the idea being that there's nothing here about nerves and brains
815240	819800	and whatnot, it's a cybernetic approach that's very substrate independent and I think that's
819800	824040	really important as we start to come up with frameworks that are really enable us to, for
824040	828400	example, recognize alien intelligences.
828400	833080	So what we think about is competency in diverse spaces.
833080	837240	Now, the thing that human beings are very good at is recognizing intelligence of medium
837240	841920	sized objects moving at medium speeds through three dimensional space, all our sense organs
841920	844320	are sort of pointed that way, we're good at recognizing that.
844320	848400	So we know when crows and things are doing intelligent navigation of three dimensional
848400	852880	space, but actually life is navigating all kinds of really interesting spaces.
852880	857600	So there's the space of possible gene expressions, and there's the space of possible physiological
857600	858600	states.
858600	861800	And then there's this, which we'll spend the most time talking about, which is morphospace.
861800	865520	This is the space of possible anatomical configurations.
865520	874200	So what I want to do next is talk about morphogenesis, the generation of body structure as the behavior
874200	877720	of a collective intelligence of cells in this morphospace.
877720	881520	So we want to think a little bit differently here.
881960	884160	Let's ask a fundamental question.
884160	887160	This is a cross section through a human torso.
887160	892520	Look at this amazing order, all of this, the tissues, the organs, everything is in exactly
892520	896000	the right place, the right orientation, relative to the right size.
896000	897760	Where does this structure come from?
897760	901720	You would think that it would take an incredible amount of information to specify all this.
901720	904360	And by the way, what would that information even look like?
904360	906600	What would the encoding and decoding be?
906600	910160	Because we all start life like this as a collection of embryonic plastomeres.
911080	912520	So I ask where is this information?
912520	916440	And people intuitively nowadays will say, well, it's in the DNA, it's in the genome.
916440	919440	But we can read genomes now, and we know what's in the genome.
919440	924880	What's in the genome are protein sequences, the specification of a micro-level hardware
924880	926160	that every cell gets to have.
926160	929400	There's nothing in the genome directly about any of this.
929400	937280	And so there's really a very deep set of questions about how does the cellular collective know
937280	938280	what to make?
938280	939720	How does it know when to stop?
939720	943960	If a piece is missing as regenerative medicine workers, we would like to know how to convince
943960	945640	the cells to build it again.
945640	949480	And as engineers, and we'll get to this in the last part of the talk, we might ask, well,
949480	951840	what else is possible given those exact same cells?
951840	954920	What else can we get them to build with the same hardware?
954920	961400	And so the reason that this kind of question is important is this.
961400	966000	In addition to all the basic stuff, for the biology audiences, I always point out that
966000	970200	pretty much every aspect of medicine with the exception of infectious disease, everything
970200	975040	else, birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would
975040	979560	be completely solved if we knew how to tell collections of cells what to build.
979560	983000	If we could specify what three-dimensional structure we wanted the cells to build, all
983000	984240	of this would go away.
984240	989520	And so we can think about the future where this is kind of the end game for this whole
989520	992800	field is what we really want as a kind of anatomical compiler.
992800	998040	We want to sit down and draw the animal or plant that we want, not at the level of gene
998040	999240	pathways or anything like that.
999240	1001560	You want to be able to draw the final goal here.
1001560	1006800	I want a three-headed platform like this and with this kind of nervous system.
1006800	1007880	This is what I want.
1007880	1012000	And if we knew what we were doing, this compiler would take that description and convert it
1012000	1016800	to a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells to get them to build exactly
1016800	1017800	that.
1017800	1021080	Now, we don't have anything remotely like this, despite all the incredible progress in
1021080	1022320	genetics and biology.
1022320	1023320	Why not?
1023320	1027440	Well, here's one simple example.
1027440	1029920	This is a baby axolotl.
1029920	1031440	So axolotls are kind of salamander.
1031440	1033320	This is a baby axolotl.
1033320	1034760	Baby axolotls have legs.
1034760	1036280	This is the tadpole of a frog.
1036280	1037280	Frogs don't have legs.
1037280	1040080	Now, one of the things you can make is you can make a chimeric embryo.
1040080	1041280	We call it a frog-a-lottel.
1041280	1043000	We're making these in our lab.
1043000	1047240	And so I would pose this challenge.
1047240	1049140	We have the genome for the axolotl.
1049140	1050360	We have the genome for the frog.
1050360	1051720	We have all the genetic information.
1051720	1053160	Now, I ask a simple question.
1053160	1055800	Will frog-a-lottels have legs or not?
1055800	1060560	And there are no models in the field that will help you answer that question, none.
1060560	1064160	Because even though we know a lot about the molecular pathways that are involved at the
1064160	1068320	cellular level, we really don't understand very well how large-scale decisions are made.
1068320	1072400	And in particular, not only can't we tell what the chimer is going to do, to be honest,
1072400	1074320	we can't even tell what the individual is going to do.
1074320	1079080	If you didn't already know what an axolotl was or you were able to compare that genome
1079080	1085120	to other genomes, you would have no idea what the shape or the other properties of the animal
1085120	1087120	were by looking at the genome.
1087120	1089480	So where we are is this in biology.
1089480	1091240	We're very good at this kind of thing.
1091240	1095120	We're very good at manipulating cells and molecules and getting this kind of information.
1095120	1097320	What we really want is something like this.
1097320	1101000	We would like to be able to control large-scale anatomy.
1101000	1107560	And to me, it reminds me of where computer science was a long time ago, where really
1107560	1111640	one of the things you had to do was you always had to interact at the hardware level.
1111640	1115080	So you would rewire the thing to get it to do something different.
1115080	1117400	And this is where modern molecular medicine is.
1117400	1121400	All of the exciting approaches are CRISPR genome editing.
1121400	1122880	It's basically this.
1122880	1126040	It's trying to manipulate the absolute lowest level.
1126040	1130120	And I think we can do way better than that because evolution doesn't do this.
1130120	1136440	Evolution exploits these amazing higher-level interfaces that we can now exploit as well.
1136440	1141480	That give you access to all kinds of computation, modularity, and all kinds of other interesting
1141480	1142480	things.
1142480	1147200	So one of the things that we're interested in is a degree of intelligence.
1147200	1149880	And by intelligence, I don't mean, of course, human-level intelligence.
1149880	1156120	I mean something along the lines of that cybernetic kind of scale that Weiner gave us.
1156120	1157760	And William James agreed.
1157760	1161880	He said that intelligence is the ability to reach the same goal by different means.
1161880	1166960	So this is, again, a very substrate-independent kind of functional definition.
1166960	1171040	And so what I want to talk about in terms of this anatomy is this idea of an anatomical
1171040	1172200	morphospace.
1172200	1177400	So it's a virtual space of possible anatomical configurations.
1177400	1178560	This is a simple example.
1178560	1180040	These are snail shells.
1180040	1183560	And every kind of a shell can be generated by an equation with three parameters.
1183560	1187320	So you can build a three-dimensional kind of space.
1187320	1190200	And every existing snail shell is somewhere in this space.
1190400	1191560	And then there are lots of regions.
1191560	1196200	And we can sort of argue about why those regions aren't populated by real organisms and so on.
1196200	1203920	And so let's think about how much, if any, intelligence does a collection of cells have
1203920	1206120	in navigating this morphospace.
1206120	1211680	Well, here's the very kind of simplest thing you can do is you can take an early embryo.
1211680	1213200	You can cut it in half.
1213200	1218200	And what you don't get are two half bodies.
1218200	1222320	What you actually get are two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.
1222320	1228000	So you start to get this idea that development is reliable, but it isn't hardwired because
1228000	1230840	if you introduce changes, it can still get to where it's going.
1230840	1232960	So there are a variety of starting states.
1232960	1235720	Maybe there are some local minima.
1235720	1239280	But what it knows how to do is get around and get to a correct final state.
1239280	1243880	This is being cut in half is not the normal state of affairs for embryos, but no problem.
1243880	1247320	They can still get there even when half the cells are missing.
1247320	1251640	Now this is a regeneration which works in a similar fashion.
1251640	1253520	There's our axolotl.
1253520	1257600	Axolotl's regenerate their eyes, their limbs, their jaws, which is absolutely amazing.
1257600	1261980	And so what you can do is you can cut this limb anywhere along the length.
1261980	1266160	It will build exactly what's missing, no more, no less, and then it stops.
1266160	1269680	That's maybe the most amazing part of this process is this idea that it actually knows
1269680	1271600	when to stop.
1271600	1272600	When does it stop?
1272600	1274880	Well, it stops when a correct salamander arm has been produced.
1274920	1281000	So this is some kind of means and thing going on here where when the error is low enough,
1281000	1282000	that's when it stops.
1282000	1286800	And by the way, humans of course are not like axolotl's, but we can regenerate something.
1286800	1289480	So the liver is highly regenerative.
1289480	1295320	Human children regenerate their fingertips below a certain age, and deer regenerate huge
1295320	1298160	amounts of bone and vasculature and innervation every year.
1298160	1301360	So you can think about some of these examples.
1301360	1307960	Now the other kind of competency that these cells have is really amazing, which is that
1307960	1312760	I've shown you that as an embryo, you can't count on how many cells you have.
1312760	1317400	So you have to be able to produce embryogenesis even when behalf of your cells are missing.
1317400	1322560	But it turns out you can't even count on how much DNA you have or how big your cells are.
1322560	1327440	So one thing you can do, this is kind of one of my favorite examples, this is a cross-section
1327440	1333720	through a kidney tubule in a nuke, and normally it's 8 to 10 cells and they sort of work together
1333720	1338280	to build this kind of tube, and here's a cross-section through that.
1338280	1341720	What you can do, you can do this trick where early on in development you can prevent the
1341720	1346040	cells from dividing for a bit, the DNA accumulates, every cell ends up with multiple copies of
1346040	1351960	the genome, and then you let it go, and then development proceeds, but the cells are now
1351960	1352960	much larger.
1352960	1353960	They're huge.
1354200	1359880	So no problem, despite the fact that you have too many copies of all your instructions
1359880	1364720	in every cell, and the cells are huge, what will happen is a smaller number of those cells
1364720	1368640	will work together to give you exactly the same structure, so they adjust to the cell
1368640	1369640	size.
1369640	1374000	But even better than that, if you make the cells truly gigantic by having eight times
1374000	1380560	the amount of DNA in the original egg, what will happen is one cell will bend around itself,
1380560	1383280	leaving a hole in the middle and give you the exact same tubule.
1383280	1387600	Now what's cool about this is that this is top-down causation.
1387600	1393800	This is the idea that cells will choose different molecular mechanisms to get the same job done
1393800	1395120	at the anatomical level.
1395120	1399160	So in service of getting the same large-scale structure, here what the cells are harnessing
1399160	1403840	are cell-to-cell communication, here what the harnessing is cytoskeletal bending, completely
1403840	1407000	different molecular mechanisms to get to the same step.
1407000	1412760	So the idea is that this hardware that evolution has given us is able to make up for drastic
1412760	1416520	changes of its component parts.
1416520	1421540	And the final example, and so that last example was known since the 40s, it was discovered
1421540	1428360	a long time ago, this is recent here, this is our work, and it's just a simple example
1428360	1433200	of this kind of navigating morpho space.
1433200	1436760	So here's your tadpole here, now this one has normal eyes, this is a normal tadpole,
1436760	1438720	and it becomes a normal frog.
1438720	1442200	But in order to do that, it has to rearrange its face, so the jaws have to move, the eyes
1442240	1446080	have to move forward, the nostrils have to extend, like everything has to move.
1446080	1449840	The traditional way of thinking about this was that, well, somehow the genome encodes
1449840	1454000	some hard-wired cell behaviors so that every tissue moves the right direction in the right
1454000	1458020	amount, and then you get your normal frog from the normal starting position.
1458020	1461840	So we wanted to test this hypothesis, and we thought that actually, no, probably it's
1461840	1463440	much more clever than that.
1463440	1466400	So what we did was we created what we call Picasso tadpoles.
1466400	1469040	So everything is in the wrong place, the eyes are in the side of the head, the mouth is
1469040	1472160	on top, everything is scrambled.
1472160	1477160	And the amazing thing is that these scrambled tadpoles still become pretty normal frogs,
1477160	1482160	because all of these organs starting off at the incorrect position will move around until
1482160	1485360	they get to where they're going, in fact, sometimes they go too far and actually have
1485360	1489720	to double back, but everything will move around until it lands in this correct orientation,
1489720	1490720	and then it stops.
1490720	1495560	So what evolution actually gave us is some kind of an error minimization scheme that
1495560	1498840	is able to make up for drastic defects.
1498840	1503640	This has massive implications for evolution, because it means that if you have mutations
1503640	1508480	that move your mouth off kilter or move your eye to your tail or do some kind of crazy
1508480	1511760	thing like this, it isn't necessarily the end.
1511760	1516560	And if they have other kinds of positive implications elsewhere in the body, now you get to explore
1516560	1520960	those, because these organs are fairly competent in getting where they need to go, connecting
1520960	1524400	up in the however they need to connect up and giving you some kind of functionality.
1524400	1528280	It tends to smooth the evolutionary landscape by a massive amount.
1528840	1537320	This whole kind of homeostatic process suggests that this basic emergent story that molecular
1537320	1543120	biology tells in the textbooks, basically that the standard view of things is this,
1543120	1547320	is that it's a feed-forward emergent process, basically that there are genes interacting
1547320	1551680	with each other, some of them make proteins that do things, they're sticky or they diffuse
1551680	1556480	or something, so there's this physics, and then there's this process of emergence.
1556520	1561880	So simple rules, executed in parallel over massive amounts of tiny agents give you an
1561880	1562880	emergent outcome.
1562880	1566040	And this is true, of course this is true, all of this does happen, but I think it's
1566040	1572400	massively incomplete, because one of the problems with this feed-forward kind of story is that
1572400	1578160	in addition to evolutionary issues, if you as an engineer or a bio-worker in regenerative
1578160	1585080	medicine, if you wanted to make a change up here, and this was truly a feed-forward process,
1585080	1588840	you would have no idea what to do back here, because reversing this is impossible, this
1588840	1594160	is a terrible inverse problem, and if you decided that you know I like this ax a little
1594160	1598880	but it's missing a leg, or instead I want it to be a three-fold symmetry instead of
1598880	1601200	bilateral symmetry, what genes would you change?
1601200	1605560	We have absolutely no idea how to reverse this, I don't think it's a solvable problem.
1605560	1610040	And as a result, the gains of things like genomic editing and CRISPR and so on, I think
1610040	1614520	are going to hit a glass ceiling, because for the vast majority of problems, we don't
1614520	1616320	know what to do down here.
1616320	1621640	So what we focus on in our group is these feedback loops, the idea that what's actually
1621640	1627760	going on here is that there are systems that measure error, they measure deviation from
1627760	1631960	a set point, and then they activate both at the genetic level and at the level of physics,
1631960	1637480	and this is what we'll talk about for the next bit, they try to get you closer to your
1637480	1638480	set point.
1638480	1642680	Now on the one hand, biologists of course know all about homeostasis and set points,
1643680	1647680	but there are two weird things going on here.
1647680	1652480	One is that the set point, unlike a typical biological set point, which might be metabolic
1652480	1657360	level or pH or temperature or something like that, this is a complex data structure, this
1657360	1661560	is some kind of anatomical descriptor of what this thing is supposed to look like.
1661560	1663520	How do you store that kind of set point?
1663520	1668920	The other thing is that it suggests that this whole system in a certain sense is goal-directed.
1668920	1675640	Now not magically so, but in a cybernetic sense, like a thermostat, but still, biology
1675640	1681800	doesn't, molecular biology and so on doesn't love discussing goals and things like that,
1681800	1687320	even though we now have a perfectly good engineering science of it.
1687320	1690960	What this kind of view does though is that it makes a very strong prediction, it predicts
1690960	1695240	that if we wanted to make changes up here, if this is all true and there is some kind
1695240	1700480	of a set point being stored and it's not purely feed-forward emergence, then what we
1700480	1706080	should be able to do is find how that set point is being stored, learn to read it, learn
1706080	1710480	to rewrite it, and then the cells would build something else without having to make any
1710480	1712240	changes to the hardware down here.
1712240	1716040	In other words, if it's true that there's some degree of reprogrammability, this idea
1716040	1721720	that the collective compares to a pattern memory, builds to that pattern, we could change
1721720	1724040	the pattern and not have to actually rewire the machine.
1724040	1725200	How general is this?
1725200	1726640	What else can these cells do?
1726640	1732560	You can see this now tying back into the themes that I started off with, touring and such.
1732560	1737960	For the next part of the talk, I want to show you an example of how this works because we've
1737960	1743160	been looking for this and we think we found it and we've started to learn to read and
1743160	1744840	write it.
1744840	1750320	The medium of all of this, maybe not terribly surprising for any neuroscientist, is bioelectricity.
1750320	1752760	How does this work in the brain?
1752760	1757360	Real quick, just the hardware looks like this, there's a collection of cells in the network.
1757360	1763040	They have ion channels which enable voltage states to exist and maybe propagate to their
1763040	1767840	neighbors via these electrical synapses known as gap junctions, so that's the hardware.
1767840	1773320	The commitment of neuroscience is that all of the electrophysiology that goes on, and
1773320	1780400	so this group made an amazing video of zebrafish brain activity in a live fish thinking about
1780520	1785960	whatever it is that fish think about, that the idea is that all of the memories, the
1785960	1794640	goals, the cognitive content of that mind is embedded in this electrical activity and
1794640	1797080	thus there's the idea of neural decoding.
1797080	1801160	If we understood the encoding, we should be able to read out the physiological activity
1801160	1808600	and then understand what the animal was thinking about or what its memories were and that kind
1808600	1809600	of thing.
1809680	1815560	It turns out that this same exact system works everywhere in your body, so this is an extremely
1815560	1818920	ancient set of tools that the evolution uses.
1818920	1822600	Every cell in your body has ion channels, most cells in your body have the exact same
1822600	1828800	electrical synapses, there are neural transmitter signaling in most tissues of the body and
1828800	1831400	so we can now think about a similar project.
1831400	1834400	What about neuroscience outside of neurons?
1834400	1839360	What if we could decode the electrical conversations that other cells were having with each other
1839360	1847840	and understand how this kind of electrical glue was functioning outside of the brain
1847840	1853680	and so this is an early frog embryo using very similar technology, we developed voltage-sensitive
1853680	1858800	dye imaging, so the colors are voltages, they're of course very slowly changing compared to
1858800	1864640	this, but you can, this is a time lapse over about 12 hours, you can see all the electrical
1864640	1868480	conversations that the cells have with each other and all the patterning that goes on.
1869440	1875080	Now we know what brains think about, they think about behavior in three-dimensional spaces
1875080	1880720	and maybe linguistic spaces, what does the rest of the body think about using that same
1880720	1882720	process?
1882720	1889200	Well, whereas in the brain what you have here is you have an electrical network issuing
1889200	1895400	commands to muscles to move the body through three-dimensional space, there's a very isomorphic
1895400	1901080	kind of picture where actually long before that what the system was doing was issuing
1901080	1907200	commands to individual cells to move the configuration of your body through morpho space, right?
1907200	1913720	So what we think evolution did was this was first and then what it simply did was to pivot
1913720	1918080	this whole thing to motion spaces instead of anatomical spaces.
1918080	1922920	So we started, we got our inspiration from neuroscience, we steal a lot of tools and
1922920	1928760	concepts from the neuroscientists and so here are some of the tools we use.
1928760	1933560	First of all, we can do the imaging to see what the electrical activity is, we do a lot
1933560	1939000	of quantitative simulation to understand how the voltages arise from the various ion channel
1939000	1944560	activity, here's what some of these things look like, this is an early frog embryo putting
1944560	1949520	its face together and one of the things you can see and so the grayscale here is the
1949560	1959560	bioelectric voltage potentials across the tissue and this is one frame from that tissue,
1959560	1964800	from that video, what you can see is that long before the genes turn on to actually pattern
1964800	1971600	the face and long before the face really appears, you can already read out a pre-pattern, a
1971600	1975920	bioelectrical pre-pattern of what the future face is going to look like, here's where the
1975920	1979480	mouth is going to be, here's where the eye is going to be, here are the placodes, I'm
1979480	1983640	showing you this one because it's the most obvious one to understand, there's other patterns
1983640	1987720	that we need a lot of decoding but this one's kind of simple, you can see exactly what it's
1987720	1993640	going to do and this pattern is functional, if I change the electrical properties of this,
1993640	1999880	if I draw using either optogenetics or other tools to draw on this, I can wipe out this
1999880	2003760	eye, I can put it somewhere else, I can change the location of the mouth, all of this is
2003760	2010560	actually determinative, this is the set point that guides future cell activity, so that's
2010560	2015120	a natural bioelectrical pattern, this is a pathological one, we'll talk about that momentarily
2015120	2020760	but this is the one, there's an incipient tumor which we injected a human oncogene and
2020760	2026800	before that tumor appears, you can already see the disruption where these cells are basically,
2026800	2031360	that oncogene causes them to electrically isolate from their neighbors and basically
2031360	2035040	at that point they're just amoebas treating the rest of the animal as external environment,
2035040	2039360	they just disconnect from everything, so we use the same tools that neuroscientists use
2039360	2045680	to control these electrical states, we can target the ion channels here, we can target
2045680	2050360	the gap junction, so we can control the topology of the electrical network, we can control
2050360	2057240	the specific states using optogenetics, using drugs, using ion channel mutations, no electric
2057240	2063240	fields, applications, no waves, no magnets, no electromagnetics, this is exactly what
2063240	2069400	neuroscientists do by controlling, by exploiting the actual interface that the system gives
2069400	2073920	us to manipulate the computations that it does, so how do we know this is of any use,
2073920	2078280	what happens when you do this, well there's one simple example, what we can do is I showed
2078280	2083240	you a bioelectrical pattern that tells the animal where to put its eye, so well we can
2083240	2088000	reproduce that pattern somewhere else by injecting ion channel genes, specific let's
2088000	2091600	say potassium channels somewhere else, and so you can introduce that pattern onto the
2091600	2095880	gut and that tells the gut cells, hey you need to make an eye here, and if you section
2095880	2100560	that eye you get all the right lens, right in the optic nerve, you get all that stuff,
2100560	2105360	now couple of interesting things, one is that the modularity is amazing because what we
2105360	2111040	actually introduce is a very low information content signal, we don't give all the information
2111040	2114240	that you need to know how to make an eye, what are all the 30 different cell types that
2114240	2117560	are inside the eye, we don't produce any of that, it's very modular, it's a subroutine
2117560	2123520	call, we say build an eye here and everything else, all the molecular cascades that actually
2123520	2128600	require to build an eye and make retinal cells and all that, all that's downstream, so that's
2128600	2133120	the first thing, it's highly modular, the second thing is that it has a really interesting
2133120	2140820	competency, one of them is that in this case what you're looking at, this is a cross section
2140820	2145660	of a lens, right here, sitting out in the tail somewhere of a tackle, and the blue cells
2145660	2151140	are the ones that we actually injected with our ion channel, so we told these blue cells
2151140	2155160	you need to make an eye, but there's not enough of them to make an eye, so very much like
2155160	2159100	ants in an ant colony, what they do is they know how to recruit their neighbors, what
2159100	2162100	they did is recruit a bunch of these brown cells which themselves were never touched
2162100	2166780	by us, they're completely normal body cells and they're able to say to these cells, we
2166780	2169980	need to make a lens here, there's not enough of us to make a lens, you're now going to
2169980	2174300	participate, and that same thing is studied by people who work on collective insects and
2174300	2182060	so on, this ability to gauge the sort of size of the project you're embarking on and recruit
2182060	2185940	other members of the swarm to work with you, so these cells certainly have the ability
2185940	2192220	to do that, you can make, using that same modulation we've discovered the code for things
2192220	2200500	like inner ear organs, so otocysts, hearts, so inducing ectopic hearts, extra forebrain,
2200500	2204660	extra limbs, here are some six-legged frogs here that you can see, and fins, now this
2204660	2208820	is interesting, tadpoles aren't supposed to have fins, that's more of a fish thing,
2208820	2213100	we'll get to that momentarily, and so one thing that we can do with this now that we're
2213100	2216900	starting to sort of uncover some of the native subroutines that are there is we can use this
2216900	2221820	in a regenerative medicine setting, so here's a frog, normally if a frog loses a leg here
2221820	2226020	by 45 days later there's nothing, frogs don't regenerate their legs at this stage on like
2226020	2230420	salamanders, but what we can do now is we can give it the signal that says hey you need
2230420	2236340	to rebuild this leg, and what happens here is that the way we do that is with a drug
2236340	2241700	that opens specific iron channels at the wound, it turns on the genes that you need to get
2241700	2246220	started on regeneration, by 45 days you've already got some toes, you've got a toenail,
2246220	2251460	eventually a very nice leg, which is touch sensitive and multile, so it's a very simple
2251460	2256820	approach to, again we're not reprogramming stem cells, we're not 3D printing any tissues,
2256820	2261060	this is that point about the programming I made earlier on, we do not want to interact
2261060	2267140	with the system at the lowest level by telling molecular pathways or cells what to do, we
2267140	2271100	want to discover the large scale subroutines and the large scale control structure that
2271100	2279220	allows us to say build a leg, so we are at this point in trials in rodents, I have to
2279220	2284460	do a disclosure here because this is Dave Kaplan and I are co-founders of Morphosuticals which
2284460	2290460	seeks to apply this kind of approach to regenerative medicine hopefully someday for humans, so
2290460	2296300	you can see that, that's kind of the applied side of the work, I want to switch to an amazing
2296300	2300780	example, which really is going to help us understand some more aspects of this, which
2300780	2305860	are that, these are the plenary, you can cut them into as many pieces as you want, I think
2305860	2312180	the record is like 275 or something like that, they're immortal, they have no lifespan limit,
2312180	2317820	they do not age, they're extremely resistant to cancer and they have the world's worst
2317820	2324540	genome, we can talk about what that means later on if we have time, but they have incredible
2324580	2332380	capacity for morphogenetic control, one of the interesting things is that, remember that
2332380	2339460	I promised you at the beginning that we would be able to look for the pattern memory, we
2339460	2344220	would look for that encoding of the set point, that anatomical set point that tells the cells
2344220	2349260	what do we build and when are we complete, so I want to show you a story where we can
2349260	2352900	rewrite that pattern memory and I've kind of shown you examples already, the thing with
2352940	2357140	the face and the eye is kind of an example, but I think this is even better, so here's
2357140	2361580	our plenary, it has one head and one tail, the anterior genes are up here, turned on
2361580	2365860	at the head, turned off at the tail, fine, and if I amputate head and tail, this middle
2365860	2371940	fragment reliably 100% of the time gives us a nice worm, now one of the things that we
2371940	2376500	did was to discover a bioelectric circuit that actually told the cells, this fragment, well
2376500	2380380	how many heads are you supposed to have, once the head and the tail are chopped off, which
2380460	2385740	end is the head or maybe both should be the head, how would you know, so we discovered
2385740	2390820	this electrical circuit and what we were able to do is to convert this perfectly normal
2390820	2396740	one headed animal to a state that once we cut it, it makes a two headed worm, this is
2396740	2402660	not Photoshop, these are real live animals and here's how it works, it's because if you
2402660	2408580	look at this fragment, it has this bio electrical pattern that says one head, one tail and that's
2408620	2412860	what the cells build, but what we can do is we can take using various ways to modulate
2412860	2418940	ion channels, we can convert this pattern to this pattern, now it's a little messy,
2418940	2422940	but you can see here the technology is still very much being worked out, but you can see
2422940	2427780	what's happening here, there are two, now the codes is two heads and sure enough, if
2427780	2432740	I now cut this animal, there he is, now here's a very important point that we need to understand,
2432740	2438700	this electrical map is not a map of this two headed creature, this electrical map is
2438700	2444020	a map of this one headed animal in which we have manipulated the electric circuit such
2444020	2450060	that the voltage looks like this, it sits there being one headed until it's injured
2450060	2453980	and at that point the cells consult this map and build this two headed worm, so the bio
2453980	2458620	electrical pattern is not a read out of the current anatomy, this is a, you can think
2458620	2462700	about this as a primitive counterfactual memory, this is a memory of something that is not
2462740	2467580	happening right now, in fact may never happen, but if it does, if we get injured, this is
2467580	2471780	what a correct worm is supposed to look like and we will keep rebuilding until this is
2471780	2477940	the pattern we get, so this is an encoded set point, a single headed planarian body can
2477940	2482980	encode at least one of two different ideas of what a planarian is supposed to look like,
2482980	2487980	maybe no doubt more, we just said we found it, we found two, so this is very important,
2487980	2492540	this is the basics of counterfactual memory, this electric circuit can hold at least one
2492580	2497580	of two different representations of what correct planarian should look like and upon injury
2497580	2501420	the cells don't, this is their reference point, they have nothing else to gauge by, now why
2501420	2505860	do I keep calling it a memory, because like every good memory, it is not only rewritable
2505860	2512020	but it's long term stable, so if I take these two headed worms and now I amputate the head
2512020	2517060	and I amputate this other topic head and I leave just the nice normal mid fragment, no
2517060	2521300	more treatments of any kind, plain water, the genetics haven't been changed, we never
2521340	2524620	edited the genome, there's nothing wrong with the genetics of this animal, so you might think
2524620	2528580	that okay well once you've cut this off, now you'll go back to normal, and that's not what
2528580	2535900	happens, so these animals forever in perpetuity now generate two headed worms, so where is
2535900	2540580	the fact, where is it stored that they're now two headed worms, it is stored in the
2540580	2545140	electrical pattern distributed over the cells, that pattern has a memory property, once you've
2545140	2549380	changed it, it holds and in fact now we know how to change it back, so we can take that
2549380	2553620	pattern, change it back to a one headed and then you get a line of one headed animals,
2553620	2561660	so the answer to how, what determines how many heads Plinaria have is not really nailed
2561660	2565980	down by the genetics, what the genetics does is it gives you an electric circuit that by
2565980	2572060	default says one head, but that circuit is reprogrammable, you can change it to say two
2572060	2577420	heads and it will hold state as far as we can tell forever, and then you can sort of
2577540	2581820	flip it back and forth, so you can think of this as a distributed flip flop, and here
2581820	2590980	are these two headed Plinaria in their native habitat, so what we're doing now, so there's
2590980	2594500	a lot of computational work that needs to happen, one thing is that we're trying to map
2594500	2600380	out the bioelectric state space of that circuit to understand why certain parts of it correspond
2600380	2605460	to one head, two head and so on, and view that kind of regeneration as a kind of energy
2605500	2608900	minimization process, where basically what you're doing, and this will be familiar to
2608900	2614180	all of you who study this kind of stuff, to recover these pattern memories when they are
2614180	2623780	damaged, and so we really want to see if some of the tools of connectionist kinds of computer
2623780	2627540	science can help us understand what's going on here, the link between the physics of the
2627540	2632660	circuit and the information processing of memory, of recall, of energy minimization and so on.
2632740	2637220	Now, I want to show you how far we can go with this, so here I've shown you one head,
2637220	2641740	two head, I mean that's pretty cool, but these are normal heads that belong to these animals
2641740	2646060	anyway, but one thing you can do is you can push them into further attractors in that state
2646060	2651300	space that belong to other species, so I can take this triangular shaped worm with no genetic
2651300	2657100	change whatsoever, with completely normal hardware I can cause, just by disrupting that
2657100	2660940	electrical decision making when you cut off the head, they have to decide what the head
2661420	2665900	shape is, I can make flat heads like the Pifelina, we can make round heads like an S-Mediterranean,
2665900	2671180	or of course we can make the normal ones. The shape of the brain becomes just like these other
2671180	2677420	species, the distribution of stem cells in the brain becomes just like these other species,
2677420	2684140	they can access, a genetically normal set of cells can access other morphological attractors
2684940	2688780	if you push them that way along this bioelectrical interface.
2689740	2693820	You can even push them further and you can make, you can reach shapes that don't belong to
2693820	2698380	plenary at all, so you can make these kind of hybrid forms, you can make radially symmetrical,
2698380	2703900	you know sort of ski cap looking things, you can make these weird spiky forms, there's a tremendous
2703900	2710620	variety of anatomical forms that you can achieve if you interfere with the ability of these cells
2710620	2715580	to navigate morpho space, what they want to do is to reach this region of the morpho space,
2715580	2719420	and they're very good at it, but now that we found this electrical process by which they
2719420	2727420	navigate, we can push them into other areas. So what we're doing now is we're building some,
2727420	2733900	so we have a very biorealistic computational simulator of electrical activity, so we can
2733900	2739660	sort of look at the circuits at the tissue level, how do they rescale and all of that,
2739660	2746300	and then we're trying, the goal, long-term goal, is this kind of full stack model where we start
2746300	2751340	with the facts of which ion channels are expressed, so that's where the genetics plays out, and that's
2751340	2756140	your hardware, but then at the tissue level, what are all the voltage dynamics? They're really not
2756140	2761020	obvious because all of these channels, a lot of them are voltage gated, that's a voltage gated
2761020	2764940	current conductance, that's a transistor, so when you put these things into circuits,
2765820	2771100	all kinds of symmetry breaking loops, they have all, they can do memory as I just shown you,
2771100	2776220	they have all kinds of interesting computations, but very nonlinear, hard to predict, and so then
2776220	2782300	we want to understand this decision making of head versus tail versus what else, and to the point
2782300	2786140	where we get to an algorithmic model, so we're using some machine learning approaches to try and
2786140	2791740	extract actually kind of white box algorithmic models, so that then at this point we can say,
2791740	2797660	okay, but what would we need to do if we wanted a fatter worm or three heads or, you know,
2797660	2801980	somebody needed a new finger or a new eye or something like that? Okay, so for the last bit,
2801980	2806140	I'm just gonna finish up with a couple of things. I want to talk about very quickly
2807820	2814300	this idea of, because what I've shown you is the collective intelligence of individual cells
2814300	2819100	solving a very large-scale problem, they solve a problem that the individual cells don't have,
2819100	2824940	so I want to talk about this idea of scaling. This is what evolution does. Evolution takes
2824940	2833180	this kind of creature and enables them to connect with each other to solve problems
2833180	2837420	at the level of anatomical morphospace, so for example, if we don't have enough fingers,
2837420	2841500	we will know that the tissue knows that and can regenerate the right number of fingers,
2841500	2845340	then it stops. Individual cells have no idea what a finger is or how many fingers there are
2845340	2849900	or anything like that, but the collective does, and so what evolution does is this amazing scaling
2849900	2855340	up, but that process has a failure mode. That failure mode is known as cancer, so what happens in
2855340	2862220	cancer is that when individual cells disconnect from this electrical network, they go back to being
2862220	2868060	a single cell amoebas where their goals are now maximal proliferation and maximal metabolic gain
2868060	2873100	instead of having goals in anatomical morphospace, so this is human glioblastoma, these are cells,
2873420	2879900	crawling around in culture with no inclination to work hard towards these kinds of things.
2879900	2886300	So what happens is that the magic here is in these electrical connections, these gap junctions
2886300	2891820	that allow cells to share information very tightly, and in particular, their synapses,
2891820	2896780	they're called synapses because they are open and closed by prior experiences, meaning that
2896780	2901980	the information that moves through a particular synapse also feeds back because of their voltage
2901980	2906780	sensitivity to open and close that synapse, so you have this kind of activity-dependent memory,
2906780	2913580	and so that allows a tissue to have much larger cognitive light cones in terms of how much do
2913580	2918620	they remember, how much can they anticipate, how much can they measure than individual cells,
2918620	2924620	that's the scale-up, and so another biomedical application that we're working on is to force
2924620	2930220	that connection, so here is this, we inject an oncogene, so normally it would make a tumor,
2930220	2934140	here it is, the oncogene is blazingly expressed, in fact it's all over the place here,
2934140	2938860	but there is no tumor because what we've done is we've co-injected a very specific ion channel
2938860	2943020	that forces that cell to remain an electrical connection with their neighbors, so when you
2943020	2946700	force them, even if the genetics are screwed up, so I've shown you a number of examples where
2946700	2952940	the genetics is diverting from the actual outcome, what the hardware says is one thing,
2952940	2956700	but you can make changes, and we have lots of other examples of fixing birth defects and other
2956700	2962620	things in software by temporary electrical states that push the system in a way that
2963900	2969100	it normally wouldn't have done, and so this is a tumor normalization technology that we're also
2969100	2974300	trying to move to a medical outcome, so what we're trying, the big mystery here, what we're
2974300	2982300	trying to do now is to make computational models of local homeostatic loops that started out in
2982300	2989180	bacteria by managing pH and metabolics and things like that, and show how by connecting these, so
2989180	2992700	basically what you have is a network of homeostats, so you have a network of these things that are
2992700	3004700	able to control local variables towards set points, and by connecting them you are enabling the
3004700	3009900	collective to now do the same thing, but in a much much different space, and so this is the
3009900	3014780	kind of big area where we need to understand lots more, and so these are the kind of models
3014780	3019020	that we're thinking about. Okay, so for the last kind of couple of minutes, I want to talk about
3019660	3027020	this idea of novel organisms, so we wanted, oh, and I have to do another disclosure, this is we
3027020	3033020	also have a spin-off company for biorebotics called Fauna Systems, and this is all the work
3033020	3037740	with Josh Baumgart at University of Vermont, with whom we've started this thing, the Institute for
3037740	3043900	Computationally Designed Organisms. We wanted to ask a simple question, how far does this plasticity
3043900	3049660	go? I've shown you that normal embryos are able to adapt to changes of cell number, cell shape,
3049660	3057740	amount of DNA, but also you can push them to make, you can make worms with the heads that belong to
3057740	3063740	other species and worm bodies that are just not normal plenaria worms, so how far does that plasticity
3063740	3070140	go? And in particular, if you take cells away from their normal context, can they reboot their
3070140	3075180	multicellularity? What will they do? And so we did this experiment, I'm going to pause this right
3075180	3081100	here, so this is a frog embryo in cross-section, if you take off this top part here, these all of
3081100	3085580	these cells up here are going to be skin, they're all faded to be different kinds of epidermis,
3086380	3090460	and so we asked this question, if I take these cells, I disassociate them,
3091180	3097180	I put a little drop of them in a separate environment away from all of this stuff, so
3097180	3104380	I'm not, we're not adding any kind of, and by the way the person who physically does this is
3104380	3108940	Doug Blackiston in our group, he's a staff scientist who perfected a lot of these protocols,
3109580	3113900	we're not adding synthetic biology constructs, we're not changing the DNA, we're not putting
3113900	3118700	any weird nano materials, we're engineering by subtraction, we're taking away the instructive
3118700	3123580	signals from all of this stuff, and so what would they do? Well, they might die, they might spread
3123580	3127500	out and sort of crawl away from each other, they might form a two-dimensional monolayer like cell
3127500	3132620	culture, we don't know, but those are some things they might do, instead what they do is, so here
3132620	3137740	these are loose cells, this is time-lapse, so overnight they sort of come together and they
3137740	3142380	merge into this little thing, this little round thing, the flashes or calcium flashes, we'll talk
3142380	3147980	about that momentarily, what does it do? So this is a little ball of skin, what does a little ball
3147980	3153260	of skin do? Well the first thing it does is, it takes little hairs that are normally used on the
3153260	3159020	skin to move the mucus down the body of the animal, and it uses those hairs to swim, it rose
3159660	3166300	through the media by pushing the little hairs in opposite directions to the left and right of a
3166300	3172860	midline that it can organize, here you can see some behaviors, so they can go in circles, they can
3172860	3179180	sort of patrol back and forth, they can hear some tracking data on group behavior, so this guy's going
3179180	3185740	on kind of a long journey, these are interacting with each other, then sometimes they sit still
3185740	3190300	for long periods of time, they have autonomous motion, this is what they look like in a maze,
3190300	3194620	so this is a water maze, there's no flow, there are no gradients, it's just still spring water,
3194620	3199420	it goes down here, it takes the corner without having to bump into the outside wall, so it doesn't
3199500	3204540	have to bump into anything, it just follows the corner, and then around this at this point, let's
3204540	3208060	play it again, so remember this is just skin, there are no brain, there's no brain, there's no nervous
3208060	3213660	system, so it takes this corner, and at this point for some reason that we don't know, internal
3213660	3217420	behaviors, it turns around and goes back where it came from, doesn't want to keep going anymore,
3217420	3222540	so they have a range of behaviors, if you ask what does the calcium signaling look like, again no
3222540	3229180	neurons here, but the skin is actually very active with very brain-like dynamics, which we are now
3229180	3233100	analyzing using information theory and things like that, to see what's going on and whether they
3233100	3237340	might be talking to each other, they have regenerative capacity, so if I cut it in half,
3237340	3243020	they will try to fold up to their new xenobot shape, with the amazing force to the 180-degree hinge
3243020	3248620	that they have to deploy to fold themselves up, and the most amazing thing that they do is this,
3248620	3257180	this is, so Josh and his student Sam Creedman did computational simulations of these guys in a
3257180	3261820	virtual world with different shapes that we, you know, that Doug was able to actually make,
3261820	3266940	and we saw something very interesting that in the computational kind of simulation,
3266940	3274140	one of the things they do is they rearrange the particles in their environment
3274140	3279340	into specific shapes, that was a prediction of the simulation, so we tried, we gave them some
3279340	3283580	particles, what did we give them, we gave them cells, loose cells, this is the white stuff,
3283660	3287980	the snow here, that those are loose cells, and what you see is that the xenobots run around,
3287980	3298220	they corral these particles into little piles, and then they sort of continue to polish those
3298220	3302780	little piles until they become kind of these circular things, and then because what we did
3302780	3308060	was we gave them skin cells, these little piles became the next generation of xenobots, and so
3308060	3312700	guess what, when they matured, they went and did the same thing, and they created the next generation
3312700	3319100	of xenobots, so this is Von Neumann's dream, this is a machine that runs around and makes copies
3319100	3324300	of itself from particles that it, or the parts that it finds in its environment, the only reason
3324300	3329100	this trick works, of course, is because like evolution, and like us, it's working within a
3329100	3335020	gentle material, it's working with cells that are not passive pebbles, but are actually materials
3335020	3340300	that when you collect them into a little pile, they already have the competency of becoming
3340300	3346620	a xenobot, so it actually takes very little to get this reproductive cycle happening,
3346620	3351420	so the last couple of things I just want to say is this, we can learn some interesting things from
3351420	3357820	this, this is the standard Xenopus lavas genome, the standard frog, if you only observe standard
3357820	3363180	development, you are really lulled into a false sense of security, you're given the idea that,
3363180	3369420	well, acorns always make oak trees, frog eggs always make frogs, the genome determines morphology,
3369420	3374300	this is what they can make, they make an embryo that has a certain set of developmental sequences
3374300	3381820	and then a certain behaviors, that's what this hardware makes. Actually, if you liberate these
3381820	3385740	skin cells, so what do skin cells know how to do? Well, of course, they know how to be a boring
3385740	3391340	two-dimensional outer layer on this animal, keep out the bacteria, that's it, well, that's what
3391340	3396620	they do when the other cells sort of bully them into that role, the instructive interactions
3396620	3401580	from the other cells are what's constraining the capacity of these skin cells to sit quietly as
3401580	3407740	the outer layer and that's that. On their own, given the ability to escape these instructive
3407740	3411820	interactions, they're actually capable of much more, they make a xenobite, they undergo a
3411820	3415260	developmental sequence over the next two months, they become this thing, I don't know what the
3415260	3423740	heck this is, they have their own kind of weird developmental trajectory and their behaviors
3423740	3429740	are things like making copies of themselves via kinematic self-replication. Now, this is interesting
3429740	3435340	because for every other creature on earth, if you were to ask why does it have a certain shape,
3435340	3440140	a certain behavior, how does it be able to do whatever it is that it does, the answer is always
3440140	3444540	the same, well, years of selection, right, eons of evolutionary pressure to do this or that,
3445180	3448780	there's never been any xenobots, there's never been any evolutionary pressure to be a good
3448780	3455180	xenobot, to do kinematic self-replication to any of the behaviors that they do and the morphology,
3455180	3459340	there's never been any pressure for that. So, where does this come from, right, this plasticity,
3459340	3465820	this amazing fact that evolution gave us this genome that very reliably does this, but it also
3465820	3469740	can do this and who knows what else, right, I think we're just scratching the surface. So,
3469740	3475100	I'm going to end here and just say that the main points, I think, that are emerging from all our
3475100	3480940	work, including many things I didn't show you, is this. Evolution tends to build generic problem
3480940	3487580	solving machines, which because of this kind of compression of complex bodies into a single cell
3487580	3494540	during sexual reproduction, really enables some amazing hardware that exploits aspects of physics
3494540	3500060	and computation that doesn't try to pre-code everything. And development shows us that these
3500060	3506220	kind of agents in morphospace and in other spaces really have to deal with whatever they're given
3506220	3513580	at the beginning. They are not, in the large part, they are not tied to a very specific, very tight
3513580	3519660	set of initial conditions. And we can also talk about, there's this intelligence ratchet that's
3519660	3525820	formed because that competency actually hides a lot of genomic fitness information from evolution.
3525820	3530060	So, a lot of the effort goes into that competency, actually, as opposed to the hardware.
3530940	3536780	And the physiology, especially the bioelectrics, can navigate various problem spaces with all
3536780	3541580	kinds of competencies, all kinds of interesting competencies. And then, synthetic bioengineering
3541580	3550380	tells us that life, because of all of this, life is extremely interoperable. We can make any kind of
3551020	3559180	combination of hardware, software. This is one of my favorite kind of videos. This is an early
3559180	3563020	baby mantle, discovering for the first time what kinds of effectors it has. Look at this,
3563020	3568220	I've got legs, I've got arms, amazing. So, one of the, they don't know. You see, you don't know
3568220	3573580	ahead of time when embryos are born into this world, much like Josh Bongard's robots.
3575180	3579900	They don't know right away what they have, where their boundaries with the outside world is.
3579900	3584300	All of that has to be computationally defined spontaneously. So, if we're thinking about
3586940	3591020	how intelligence has come into this world, here's what the biology is telling us.
3591020	3595660	Multiscale competencies, lots of levels, as Daniel was talking about at the very beginning,
3595660	3601020	competing and cooperating with each other. Spontaneous emergence of boundaries, energy
3601020	3607020	constraints, which require you to do core, coarse graining on your inputs. Self-modeling,
3607020	3611580	all of this kind of stuff is what biology is telling us. And because of this interoperability,
3612700	3617820	everything that we know in the natural world, all of the Darwin's endless forms, most beautiful,
3617820	3623580	are just the tiny corner of this option space. Every combination of evolved material,
3623580	3630300	designed machinery, and software is some kind of agent. And a lot of this already exists.
3630300	3636620	So, hybrid, cyborgs, all kinds of things where the future is going to look like this. And that
3636620	3641900	really means that we have to redefine a lot of our old categories that started out by looking at
3641900	3646620	this picture of the Garden of Eden, where you have a standard human, you have some standard animals,
3646620	3651900	and that's it. And you can draw a simple line and you know what's going on. That picture is gone.
3651900	3655980	So, I'm just going to close here. There are some papers that if anybody's interested in
3655980	3660860	diving further into these issues, here's some papers I could send you. I want to thank all
3660860	3666540	the people that did the work. So, Doug and Sam did all the Xenobot work. Here are the other
3667260	3671260	students and postdocs that contributed to this stuff, our collaborators, our funders,
3671980	3675740	most of all, our model systems, the animals do most of the heavy lifting here.
3676540	3679580	And that's it. Thank you for listening and I will take any questions.
3680140	3683100	Oh, thank you for a truly marvelous talk.
3683900	3684460	Thank you.
3684460	3692620	So, yes. And yeah, so we have a few minutes for questions. I think you said we have about
3692860	3702380	10 minutes left. So, yeah, okay. Yes, Daniel, I think you were first.
3702380	3707980	Hey, if I start asking, nobody else will have time. So, I'll leave the others and
3708860	3710780	leave my mind for the last.
3710780	3713180	Okay, Christoph, I thought I saw your hand.
3716140	3717580	Oh, sorry, I was just clapping.
3718060	3726540	Oh, okay, okay. Well, anyone else before I start asking questions as well.
3728540	3738060	So, okay, in that case, I have too many questions and I don't know enough about it.
3738060	3744380	And I'd really like to know more about these bioelectrical patterns and how you, I don't know,
3744380	3751900	for instance, seem to have gained control over how to manipulate those, say for, you know,
3751900	3757660	you fix the genetics and you give it the somehow the phenotype of a different creature,
3757660	3763980	a different animal entirely. That is absolutely mind blowing, I have to say. And how,
3765340	3769660	I mean, it almost seems like, you know, you could make the phenotype of,
3770540	3777020	it almost seems like the genetics isn't as important as we, as we thought it, I mean,
3777020	3783420	yeah, as we thought it would be. I mean, it's just, yeah, to how, to what extent can you get
3783420	3789180	something with a sort of drastically, how drastically different can the phenotype end up?
3790060	3796620	I think, I think that, well, look, in the, in the plan area, it's 150 million years difference
3796620	3801420	between the animals that we start with and the ones that we can make. And it's equivalent to
3801420	3806860	150 million years of evolutionary distance to these other species. Plus, of course, we can make
3806860	3810780	shapes that never existed, that never existed. So, you know, I don't know what the distance
3810780	3816460	there would be. But I think it's a very important point. I think absolutely the role of the genome
3816460	3822700	is not what we thought it was. You know, one of the, one of the key things here is though,
3822700	3825420	is that I think, and a lot of people get very suspicious about, you know,
3825420	3829260	sort of computer science analogies, but I think, I think the part that is actually very,
3829260	3835100	very useful is the distinction between hardware and software. So I think that tells us what,
3835100	3839660	you know, the genome, this, this, there's the, you know, some of our students are taught this,
3839660	3844380	this that, well, you know, the cell is the, is the hardware that interprets the genome and the
3844380	3848300	genome is the software of this. I think that's, that's completely wrong. I think what, what the
3848300	3852460	genome actually does is nail down the hardware of the cell. The genome tells you what channels
3852540	3856620	you're going to have. If your genome does not give you a voltage-gated ion channel,
3856620	3860620	there's very limited, you don't have those transistors, there's very limited things you can
3860620	3866540	do. So the hardware is critical because it, it, it, it facilitates or forbids certain kinds of
3866540	3871980	behavior modes. But we all know now that knowing the hardware does not tell you all of the
3871980	3875260	interesting things you need to know about what this thing is going to be able to do.
3875260	3880220	Not only does it, that is, that can the same hardware run many different kinds of, of, of
3880220	3886540	behavior modes, but also it means that the way you interact with it does not have to be at the
3886540	3891420	hardware level, right? That, that's kind of the huge, the huge insight to me of, of, of, of, of
3891420	3895580	computer science is this idea of reprogrammability. There, there are certain, that once you get beyond
3895580	3901580	a certain capacity, and I think biological systems are way beyond that, you can, you can interact
3901580	3907020	with it via inputs, via stimuli, via communication, via, you know, who knows how high that goes,
3907020	3913980	not just by rewiring it. And so I think that all of this, you know, the focus on, on the DNA,
3913980	3919020	both as the source of the information and as the optimal control knob, right, all the excitement
3919020	3923260	over genomic editing and everything else, those things I think are, are misplaced. But that's
3923260	3926380	not to say that the genome isn't important. I mean, you need to have the right hardware. If you
3926380	3929420	don't have the right hardware, it's not, you're not, you're not going to be able to do certain
3929420	3934300	things. So it's like there's a whole area of interaction with physics, what this hardware
3934380	3940220	can do that, you know, there is some physics that it exploits, and that doesn't need to be in the
3940220	3948060	genome. And yeah, it's, yeah. Yeah, that's, that's a very profound, that's a very profound idea,
3948060	3953580	which is that, and people have been thinking about this actually in, in, in mathematics for the longest
3953580	3958460	time. So, so where do the truths of number theory live, right, where, where, you know, you could
3958460	3962780	change all the facts of, of the initial conditions of the universe, and the number theory would
3962780	3967980	still be what it is, right? And so, so think about this, right? If you were to try to evolve a
3967980	3972620	triangle, so you evolve the first angle, you evolve the second angle, but guess what, you don't
3972620	3976540	need to evolve the third angle, you know what it is, right? Where does that come from, that, that,
3976540	3982860	you know, that's an amazing kind of free lunch, you know, as the physicists would say, right?
3982860	3986940	And, and the same thing with computation. So once you evolve that ion channel,
3986940	3990700	that's basically a transistor. So now you get to have logic gates and truth tables.
3990700	3995020	Did you have to evolve a truth table? No, you got that for free. Where do truth tables live?
3995020	3998780	You know, I don't know, but that's kind of beyond my pay grade. But, but, but, but, but I think
3998780	4004540	you're absolutely right is that what evolution does is it builds machines that couple to these
4004540	4010860	amazing affordances, right? So, so, so, so when, you know, in the behavioral ecology, they would
4010860	4016940	call these affordances, these incredible affordances provided by physics, by computation, by geometry,
4016940	4021900	by mechanics, you know, who knows what else is out there. Yeah, I think, I think that's,
4021900	4027260	that's, that's really an important way to look at evolution. Oh, that's, yeah. Daniel, yes.
4028540	4035100	I can't hold myself any longer. But first of all, this is an amazing talk. I wish we could
4035100	4039740	now sit together and talk for the rest of the afternoon, which neither you nor I can do. But
4039740	4047660	that we should definitely continue talking. And one thing that I, I find we, I could, first
4047660	4053660	of all, completely agree with this point about the triangle. So I just recently said to somebody
4053660	4059100	that mathematics is neither discovered, nor constructed, but it's something in between.
4059660	4065260	Right. And basically, you construct some things and then there are constraints that emerge and
4065340	4070700	they are implicit to whatever you do. It's a bit like what I call a box of oranges,
4070700	4074940	you fill the box of oranges and you get these hexagonal patterns once you're dense enough.
4074940	4081660	And this is not something you created. It's a aspect of the space that forces this upon us.
4081660	4086380	But we still have choices between different crystal patterns, for example, in the dimensions,
4086380	4091980	for example, there are 14 crystal patterns. What I was wondering, I mean, to me, it looks like
4091980	4098700	there's an element of holography in the whole thing. So where information is not fully localized.
4098700	4104060	And I felt that's the most strong reaction in your example with the brain, with double,
4105900	4114300	reconstructed brain. Because the question is how much information can you retain holographically?
4114300	4119820	So when you take this plan on one, and I think there wasn't even the experiment where even mice,
4119900	4125980	I think mice got. The question is, well, how much information can you retain when my language,
4125980	4131500	I would say, how many bits can you retain in this delocalized form?
4132540	4139180	Yeah, that's a great point. I have no idea how much information. We can't do the bits thing
4139180	4143340	because we don't know what the encoding and decoding of the message is. So that's hard.
4143340	4148540	But you're absolutely right. There's holography here in two ways. One is the sort of lateral way,
4148540	4153340	which is that, yeah, most of this information is distributed spatially across the whole animal.
4153340	4159020	So the bioelectric code and what enables us to do these various things is not a single cell
4159020	4164220	code. This is not something that tells individual cells what cell type they should be. This is
4164220	4170140	spread across the whole tissue. And of course, you can cut it both spatially and behaviorally.
4170140	4176540	It rescales the information onto every piece retains it. So that's kind of lateral holography.
4176540	4180860	There's also a vertical one, which is interesting in a very important sense.
4181580	4186860	A lot of the same rules that operate in controlling the morphology of large scale
4186860	4197500	bodies, like ours, some of those same rules are playing out in the shaping of single cells.
4197500	4204380	So there are weird kind of mathematical aspects of morphology that work the same way
4204380	4211420	in multicellular bodies, but also in single cells that are completely low at a much lower scale.
4211420	4214940	And other people have found the same thing in patterning of ant colonies and so on.
4214940	4223100	So there's also this kind of almost a fractal kind of idea that the same things repeat themselves
4223100	4226700	again and again at different scales, despite the fact that the material implementation is quite
4226700	4234620	different at that point. That's really very interesting because I do think that there might
4234620	4244460	be ways of actually quantifying that. And I very much like this attractor vision of genetic coding,
4244460	4249020	because we know that embodiment can change a lot. I mean, the talk that I give with you,
4249020	4254140	I think I mentioned that very, very primitive example of how you can totally change the amount
4254220	4261820	of information you need to do something if you change embodiment. So it's really drastically
4261820	4268140	different than the big question is how much can you associate to the embodiment? How much can
4268140	4274300	you associate to, in your case, the genome? I see the Stavros question. So I just go silent.
4274300	4277500	We can discuss another time. So let Stavros go ahead. Sorry.
4277500	4287820	Stavros? Yeah, I'll take the question with I apologize in about three minutes. I do have to run.
4290460	4297180	Yeah, sorry. Sorry to interrupt you, Daniel. Thanks for your talk. I'll be very quick. I've seen you
4297180	4301420	in other talks sort of talk about using the language of affect to kind of describe like,
4301420	4307340	you know, navigating this morphological spaces and kind of extending the concept of affect.
4307740	4315500	Beyond what it's usually used to describe these morphological spaces. Can you talk more on that?
4316300	4324060	Yeah, I think that's a very long discussion. But the short version of it is that we have been
4324060	4331740	trying to map as many concepts in cognitive neuroscience as we can onto this, for example,
4331740	4339180	navigating morphospace. So all kinds of issues that people normally attribute to. So, you know,
4340460	4346620	goal seeking behavior, rewards, punishments, different different types of learning and memory,
4346620	4352780	different types of so affect all these kinds of things, perceptual by stability, visual illusions,
4352780	4357500	all of these things can be mapped very, very nicely. And in fact, I have I have tables in
4357500	4360860	a couple of papers, which I'm happy to send, where it just goes side by side. And it shows
4360940	4366140	you exactly what the what the mapping is. And so there are mappings for, for affect and for many,
4366140	4369020	you know, for many, many of these terms. And I'm not saying all of them are going to map,
4369020	4373820	but so far, it's the symmetry has worked, you know, kind of very nicely. So you can define
4373820	4382220	these things in other spaces. So incredible. Thank you. Thank you so much. Drop me an email,
4382220	4388940	and I'll send you I'll send you the paper where we go into this. Okay. So are there any more
4388940	4393340	questions? I don't know if there's actually time for any more questions, but it's I wish there were,
4393340	4400380	but it's, yeah. So take this opportunity once more to thank the speaker for a wonderful talk.
4401340	4404940	Thank you so much. Really appreciate the discussion. And please by all means email me,
4404940	4410380	I'd love to I'd love to discuss with anybody anytime. Yeah. Thank you again. Okay. Thank you so
4410380	4422940	much, everybody. Thank you. All right. Bye.
