WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.240
Thank you so much.

00:01.240 --> 00:02.280
Thank you for having me here.

00:02.280 --> 00:05.240
It's a huge, huge pleasure to be able to share some ideas

00:05.240 --> 00:06.400
with you all.

00:06.400 --> 00:08.440
I've never been to this conference before

00:08.440 --> 00:12.240
and I'm very gonna really enjoy saying some things

00:12.240 --> 00:17.240
that are actually fairly, let's say not as radical

00:17.700 --> 00:19.700
as some other things that probably people have said.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.840
So that's a new experience for me.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.640
And so if anybody's interested in the kinds of things I do,

00:24.640 --> 00:27.160
you can find all of that here.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.760
I want to say right up front to set expectations.

00:30.760 --> 00:34.560
I don't particularly work on consciousness per se.

00:34.560 --> 00:38.200
I work on cognition, agency, intelligence, things like that.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.000
And I do think they have implications

00:40.000 --> 00:43.720
and so I will kind of go out on the ledge here today.

00:43.720 --> 00:46.160
But I'm gonna make a fairly modest claim.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.360
I'm not going to try to produce a new theory

00:48.360 --> 00:51.440
of consciousness, I'm not going to try to support

00:51.440 --> 00:53.920
one specific theory of consciousness with data.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.960
Here's what I'm going to try to do.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.360
I'm gonna try to make a fairly simple argument

00:58.360 --> 01:02.080
that if we use composition and behavior

01:02.080 --> 01:04.680
as evidence of consciousness in other systems

01:04.680 --> 01:06.920
when addressing the problem of other minds,

01:06.920 --> 01:09.160
that is if our criteria include things like

01:09.160 --> 01:12.080
what are you made of, what are your behavioral competencies

01:12.080 --> 01:14.200
and so on, if that's how we address it,

01:14.200 --> 01:15.960
then for the exact same reasons

01:15.960 --> 01:18.000
that we tend to associate consciousness

01:18.000 --> 01:20.760
with complex brains, we need to take very seriously

01:20.760 --> 01:24.120
the possibility of consciousness in many body structures.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.600
That's a very controversial claim in some audiences,

01:27.600 --> 01:30.240
maybe it won't be particularly controversial here.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.920
But what I'd really like to do is to widen

01:32.920 --> 01:35.200
the set of systems about which we think

01:35.200 --> 01:37.840
when we think about consciousness and related issues

01:37.840 --> 01:40.840
beyond human brains, when we talk about AI,

01:40.840 --> 01:42.360
I don't want to think specifically

01:42.360 --> 01:44.160
about just is it human-like

01:44.160 --> 01:47.480
because it's actually much more interesting than that.

01:47.480 --> 01:52.000
So one of the key things is that I think

01:52.000 --> 01:55.400
we have to move beyond these kind of conventional

01:55.400 --> 01:58.040
intelligences, there's a famous painting of Adam

01:58.040 --> 02:00.040
naming the animals in the Garden of Eden

02:00.040 --> 02:02.680
and if you think that there are these

02:02.680 --> 02:04.720
very sort of discreet natural kinds,

02:04.720 --> 02:07.560
then one can have these binary categories

02:07.560 --> 02:11.400
of which things do and do not have consciousness.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.840
People are pretty sure about Adam,

02:12.840 --> 02:14.240
not so sure about some of the stuff

02:14.240 --> 02:18.160
that's not shown here, paramecia, slime molds,

02:18.160 --> 02:20.180
they are various other things.

02:20.180 --> 02:22.980
So the reason that we have to think about these things

02:22.980 --> 02:25.020
is that the standard human,

02:25.020 --> 02:27.780
which features prominently in philosophical accounts

02:27.780 --> 02:29.220
of consciousness and so on,

02:29.220 --> 02:34.220
is really just one point on two continua

02:35.340 --> 02:37.340
or four, depending on how you want to count.

02:37.340 --> 02:42.180
But this kind of conscious or agential glow is,

02:42.180 --> 02:44.220
you have to sort of decide what happens to it

02:44.220 --> 02:46.860
as you walk backwards from a modern adult human

02:46.900 --> 02:50.900
all the way back to the oocyte that all of us once were.

02:50.900 --> 02:53.540
You can also walk it back on an evolutionary timescale

02:53.540 --> 02:55.620
and ask what happens all the way back

02:55.620 --> 02:57.900
because all of these things are smooth and continuous.

02:57.900 --> 03:00.780
And in fact, with modern bioengineering

03:00.780 --> 03:03.140
and synthetic biology, it's now very clear

03:03.140 --> 03:05.740
that both using biological means

03:05.740 --> 03:07.940
and sort of hybrid technological means,

03:07.940 --> 03:12.660
we can create hybrids and chimeras in every possible way

03:12.660 --> 03:15.140
and really extend the typical embodiment

03:15.140 --> 03:16.500
in very diverse directions.

03:16.500 --> 03:20.180
And so we'll get back to this more towards the end of the talk.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.340
And so what I've been working on is a framework,

03:22.340 --> 03:23.860
which I call TAME,

03:23.860 --> 03:27.180
or stands for technological approach for mind everywhere.

03:27.180 --> 03:30.380
And the idea is to be able to recognize, create,

03:30.380 --> 03:33.700
and ethically relate to truly diverse intelligences.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.300
So regardless of composition,

03:35.300 --> 03:37.740
meaning what you're made of or origin story,

03:37.740 --> 03:40.300
meaning whether you were produced the natural way

03:40.300 --> 03:42.500
or engineered or some combination thereof.

03:42.500 --> 03:46.100
And I want to be able to handle all of these kinds of things.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.340
And the familiar creatures, all kinds of weird colonial

03:48.340 --> 03:50.300
and synthetic organisms,

03:50.300 --> 03:52.740
AIs, whether software or hardware,

03:52.740 --> 03:55.140
and potentially exobiological agents.

03:55.140 --> 03:58.420
And so of course, people have tried before for these kinds of,

03:58.420 --> 04:02.340
so this is a Rosenbluth et al from the 1940s,

04:02.340 --> 04:05.780
trying for a scale of these kinds of things

04:05.780 --> 04:08.340
that are not particularly bound to embodiments,

04:08.340 --> 04:09.700
let's say brains and things like that,

04:09.700 --> 04:12.140
very kind of cybernetic definition.

04:12.140 --> 04:14.220
And I've been working on a model that has to do

04:14.220 --> 04:16.300
with what I call a cognitive light cone,

04:16.300 --> 04:19.980
which is this idea that all agents have one thing in common,

04:19.980 --> 04:22.060
no matter what they're made of or how they got here,

04:22.060 --> 04:25.940
which is the ability to pursue certain goals

04:25.940 --> 04:28.620
in certain spaces and the size of those goals,

04:28.620 --> 04:32.180
the literal spatial temporal size of the largest goal

04:32.180 --> 04:33.500
that an agent can pursue,

04:33.500 --> 04:35.100
is one way that we can classify

04:35.100 --> 04:38.180
and compare very diverse intelligences.

04:38.180 --> 04:40.220
And the critical thing is that,

04:40.220 --> 04:42.740
as I'm primarily a developmental biologist,

04:43.500 --> 04:46.340
the thing that always just astounds me

04:46.340 --> 04:48.220
is that all of us were once,

04:48.220 --> 04:50.460
what people call, quote unquote, just physics.

04:50.460 --> 04:54.260
We were all a quiescent oocyte, a little blob of chemicals,

04:54.260 --> 04:57.940
and slowly, gradually, without any magical lightning flash

04:57.940 --> 05:00.260
that comes in at any particular point during development,

05:00.260 --> 05:01.860
we become one of these things,

05:01.860 --> 05:03.660
or perhaps even something like this

05:03.660 --> 05:05.500
that can reason back and make comments

05:05.500 --> 05:07.260
about not being a machine

05:07.260 --> 05:09.140
or being more than physics and something like that.

05:09.140 --> 05:12.660
So this process is very slow and gradual,

05:12.660 --> 05:14.260
and what we're interested in

05:14.260 --> 05:18.500
is that process and the scaling of competencies

05:18.500 --> 05:20.740
of very simple, minimal matter,

05:20.740 --> 05:23.980
chemical signals, systems and cells and tissues,

05:23.980 --> 05:27.980
the scaling up of the tiny little goals of single cells,

05:27.980 --> 05:30.980
so metabolic and transcriptional goals

05:30.980 --> 05:32.020
and things like this,

05:32.020 --> 05:34.500
into collective systems that have very large goals,

05:34.500 --> 05:36.260
I'll talk about this momentarily,

05:36.260 --> 05:41.260
and the kinds of failure modes that the system has,

05:41.380 --> 05:44.060
which is a breakdown of that collectivity into cancer,

05:44.060 --> 05:46.820
back down to cells that have little tiny goals

05:46.820 --> 05:48.380
about proliferation and migration,

05:48.380 --> 05:49.220
and that's it,

05:49.220 --> 05:51.660
and they no longer care about the rest of the system.

05:51.660 --> 05:54.100
So the meat of our research program

05:54.100 --> 05:56.140
has to do with understanding the scaling,

05:56.140 --> 05:57.780
understanding that cognitive light cone

05:57.780 --> 06:00.660
and how it actually scales up from that of a single cell,

06:00.660 --> 06:02.260
and in fact, below that in some other work

06:02.260 --> 06:05.340
that we've done with Chris Fields and Carl Friston,

06:05.340 --> 06:07.540
and up, up and up.

06:07.540 --> 06:09.820
And one of the things that happens in development,

06:09.820 --> 06:11.260
which is kind of interesting,

06:11.260 --> 06:15.900
is the auto-poeses or self-construction

06:15.900 --> 06:20.580
of a single individual from a kind of a pool of potentiality,

06:20.580 --> 06:21.980
and it looks like this,

06:21.980 --> 06:23.420
this is an early blastoderm,

06:23.420 --> 06:26.880
let's say of a human or a chicken or many other animals.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.220
We see, let's say 50,000 cells,

06:29.220 --> 06:31.020
and we say there's an embryo.

06:31.020 --> 06:33.060
What are we counting when we say that's one embryo?

06:33.060 --> 06:35.020
I mean, there really isn't one of anything physical,

06:35.020 --> 06:36.340
there are many, many cells.

06:36.340 --> 06:37.460
What is there one of?

06:37.460 --> 06:39.520
And this is gonna become an individual.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.400
Well, what there's one of is alignment,

06:41.400 --> 06:46.400
both physical alignment and kind of functional alignment

06:47.560 --> 06:48.760
towards a particular goal.

06:48.760 --> 06:52.560
That alignment is the creation of a particular target

06:52.560 --> 06:54.920
morphology, a particular anatomical structure.

06:54.920 --> 06:57.080
As I'll show you momentarily, if you try to deviate it,

06:57.080 --> 06:58.520
it will find new ways to get there.

06:58.520 --> 07:02.760
So it's definitely this kind of homeostatic system.

07:02.760 --> 07:05.120
But there doesn't have to be just one.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.920
And if you make temporary scratches in this blastoderm,

07:08.920 --> 07:11.320
what you end up with, each of these regions

07:11.320 --> 07:13.520
not being able to feel the other self-organizes

07:13.520 --> 07:14.360
into an embryo.

07:14.360 --> 07:17.160
And eventually you end up with twins, triplets,

07:17.160 --> 07:18.920
and many other cells.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.600
So the question of how many individuals are in an embryo

07:22.600 --> 07:23.600
is actually not clear.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.040
It's not set up by the genetics,

07:25.040 --> 07:28.320
it's a physiological self-organizational process.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.640
And what it means is that each one of these individuals

07:30.640 --> 07:33.240
has to, on the fly, every single time

07:33.240 --> 07:35.180
that they arise in this physical world,

07:35.180 --> 07:37.020
they have to solve this important problem.

07:37.020 --> 07:40.420
Where do I end, and where does the environment begin?

07:40.420 --> 07:42.260
Every cell is some other cell's environment.

07:42.260 --> 07:45.180
How do these cells know what they belong to?

07:45.180 --> 07:48.900
And so as I think Turing actually recognized,

07:48.900 --> 07:52.060
this question of how bodies self-organize

07:52.060 --> 07:54.700
is probably fundamentally the same

07:54.700 --> 07:56.860
as the question of how minds self-organize.

07:56.860 --> 08:00.100
And we see these kinds of dynamics in split-brain patients

08:00.100 --> 08:01.660
and dissociative disorders and so on.

08:01.660 --> 08:03.500
This question of how many individuals

08:03.500 --> 08:06.940
are present within a particular amount of medium

08:06.980 --> 08:08.420
that underlies it.

08:08.420 --> 08:11.260
And so then people who think about these things

08:11.260 --> 08:13.740
often think, well, okay, we have these,

08:13.740 --> 08:15.300
what we call collective intelligences,

08:15.300 --> 08:17.860
colonies of ants and termites and so on.

08:17.860 --> 08:21.300
But at least we are a true unified intelligence, right?

08:21.300 --> 08:23.900
We sort of, many people think that there's

08:23.900 --> 08:26.580
a fundamental difference between these cases.

08:26.580 --> 08:29.940
But of course, and for example,

08:29.940 --> 08:31.580
Descartes really liked the pineal gland

08:31.580 --> 08:33.340
because it's an unpaired structure,

08:33.340 --> 08:36.240
and he felt that was suitable to the unified

08:36.240 --> 08:37.360
human experience.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.200
But if he had had access to good microscopy,

08:39.200 --> 08:41.120
he would have noticed that there isn't one

08:41.120 --> 08:42.560
of anything here either.

08:42.560 --> 08:45.080
This is what the pineal gland tissues look like

08:45.080 --> 08:46.680
inside of each one of these cells.

08:46.680 --> 08:47.840
You get all of this stuff.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.560
So there's an incredible multi-scale organization.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.440
And so the fact of the matter is, I think,

08:53.440 --> 08:56.320
that we are all collective intelligences.

08:56.320 --> 08:59.060
We are made of this kind of agential material.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.520
So this is a lacrimary, it's a single cell.

09:01.520 --> 09:05.160
It has no brain, it has no nervous system.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.280
It's very good at taking care of local goals

09:07.280 --> 09:09.440
in terms of its anatomical structure,

09:09.440 --> 09:12.000
in terms of metabolism and so on.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.760
And when we talk about machines and living organisms

09:16.760 --> 09:20.160
and consciousness, we have to remember

09:20.160 --> 09:22.040
that whatever theories we make,

09:22.040 --> 09:24.960
have to make a ruling on things like this.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.080
What happens here?

09:26.080 --> 09:29.840
I mean, certainly people have a very chemistry-based

09:29.840 --> 09:31.960
views of these things, but this is

09:31.960 --> 09:33.240
what we are actually made of.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.920
We may not feel like a collective of competent,

09:36.920 --> 09:39.760
tiny little cells that are managing perception,

09:39.760 --> 09:41.760
action, loops towards emergent goals

09:41.760 --> 09:43.640
and weird problem spaces.

09:43.640 --> 09:46.560
But in fact, I think that is exactly

09:46.560 --> 09:48.840
what it feels like to be that kind of a system.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.520
So I think we do, in fact, feel like exactly that.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.160
And so the research program that we and others

09:54.160 --> 09:57.360
are embarked upon is to discover the scaling rules.

09:57.360 --> 10:00.040
How do we go from the individual competencies

10:00.040 --> 10:04.160
of our components to rotating those goals and competencies

10:04.160 --> 10:06.040
into novel spaces?

10:06.040 --> 10:10.360
And so in bodies, not just human, but all bodies,

10:10.360 --> 10:13.480
biology uses this kind of multi-scale competency

10:13.480 --> 10:17.280
architecture, this idea that we are not only nested dolls

10:17.280 --> 10:20.440
structurally, cells, molecular networks,

10:20.440 --> 10:24.040
made of making up cells and tissues and organs and so on.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.800
But actually, each one of these layers

10:25.800 --> 10:28.720
has its own problem-solving capacity.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.160
They are all solving problems in different spaces,

10:32.160 --> 10:35.320
anatomical morpho space, the space of gene expression,

10:35.320 --> 10:36.800
the space of physiological states,

10:36.800 --> 10:39.280
and of course, familiar old three-dimensional behavioral

10:39.280 --> 10:39.960
space.

10:39.960 --> 10:43.480
And so that, I really like William James's definition

10:43.480 --> 10:45.800
of intelligence, which is the ability

10:45.800 --> 10:48.480
to reach the same end by different means

10:48.480 --> 10:50.560
using some degree of sophistication.

10:50.560 --> 10:56.080
So it's very good because it's, again, substrate invariant.

10:56.080 --> 11:00.840
It really talks about the idea of a spectrum of competencies,

11:00.840 --> 11:04.000
and it's kind of agnostic about what space we're working.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.920
And that becomes important because, for example,

11:05.920 --> 11:08.920
in conversations about AIs and other things,

11:08.920 --> 11:10.480
when we say they're not embodied,

11:10.480 --> 11:13.680
I think we really need to expand our understanding of what

11:13.680 --> 11:15.600
spaces we could be embodied in.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.880
And so we and many other animals are

11:18.880 --> 11:21.760
pretty good at recognizing intelligence

11:21.760 --> 11:25.280
in familiar three-dimensional space, so good old behavior.

11:25.320 --> 11:28.600
And this medium-sized objects moving

11:28.600 --> 11:30.760
at medium speeds in three-dimensional space

11:30.760 --> 11:33.640
were kind of familiar with birds and primates

11:33.640 --> 11:35.560
and other things doing that.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.400
But biology does the same thing in other spaces.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.080
So there are transcriptional spaces

11:40.080 --> 11:43.440
where cells are able to solve very interesting problems.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.160
Same thing with physiological space.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.280
I don't have time today, but I could give you

11:47.280 --> 11:50.960
some amazing examples of cells exerting

11:50.960 --> 11:54.480
novel problem-solving behaviors by navigating these spaces.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.040
What I will focus on for a few minutes

11:56.040 --> 11:58.440
is this anatomical morphospace.

11:58.440 --> 12:02.440
So this is basically the space of all possible configurations

12:02.440 --> 12:03.600
of a group of cells.

12:03.600 --> 12:07.680
So Darcy Thompson in the 40s was, I think, the first

12:07.680 --> 12:12.000
to really get an idea of this idea of embryos

12:12.000 --> 12:17.600
and other morphogenetic systems navigating that morphospace.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.240
And I think we really have to get into the idea

12:19.240 --> 12:22.280
that beings can be embodied and can have consciousness

12:22.280 --> 12:23.960
in these other spaces.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.400
I think that while we're very good at this,

12:26.400 --> 12:29.600
if you could imagine if you had an innate, immediate sense

12:29.600 --> 12:31.440
of your blood chemistry, let's say,

12:31.440 --> 12:33.720
I think you would have no problem recognizing

12:33.720 --> 12:35.360
that you live in a higher-dimensional space

12:35.360 --> 12:37.640
and that your liver, your kidneys, and other organs

12:37.640 --> 12:40.480
are, in fact, problem-solving intelligent agents

12:40.480 --> 12:43.480
that are navigating that space exactly the way

12:43.480 --> 12:45.520
you navigate three-dimensional space.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.960
So let's focus on morphospace and talk for a few minutes

12:47.960 --> 12:52.040
about what the competencies are of this.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.400
What we argue is that, actually, morphogenesis

12:55.400 --> 12:57.720
is the behavior of a collective intelligence.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.520
It's the collective intelligence of cells

12:59.520 --> 13:03.080
trying to achieve a particular anatomical structure.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.840
One thing we know is that development

13:04.840 --> 13:07.280
is incredibly robust and reliable,

13:07.280 --> 13:08.560
but it is not hardwired.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.200
So if I cut an early embryo in half,

13:11.200 --> 13:12.720
I don't get two half bodies.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.600
I get two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.000
And so there's this notion of different starting states

13:19.000 --> 13:21.400
being able to lead to the same goal state,

13:21.440 --> 13:24.720
this ensemble in morphospace that we equate

13:24.720 --> 13:26.960
to a normal target morphology,

13:26.960 --> 13:30.400
and they can avoid certain local minimum.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.240
Here's an example that we discovered some years ago.

13:33.240 --> 13:36.400
This is a tappel here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.240
And tappels need to become frogs.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.520
And in order to become frogs, they

13:39.520 --> 13:41.080
have to rearrange their face.

13:41.080 --> 13:44.800
So the eyes, the nostrils, everything has to move around.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.240
And so it was thought that this was a hardwired process,

13:47.240 --> 13:49.600
that every organ just moves in the right direction

13:49.600 --> 13:50.800
the right amount.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.640
What we decided to test that and to see

13:53.640 --> 13:56.080
how much intelligence actually is there.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.440
And so we created what we call Picasso tappels.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.520
Everything is scrambled.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.280
The eyes on the back of the head, the jaws are off

14:01.280 --> 14:03.640
to the side, everything is kind of mixed around.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.200
And what we found is that these tappels

14:05.200 --> 14:07.240
become largely normal frogs.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.240
Because in fact, genetics does not specify

14:09.240 --> 14:10.480
hardwired rearrangements.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.840
What it gives you is a problem-solving machine

14:12.840 --> 14:17.040
where every organ now moves in novel, unexpected paths

14:17.040 --> 14:18.200
to get to where it's going.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.680
Sometimes it actually overshoots and has to come back.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.640
But it'll stop when it's done.

14:22.640 --> 14:24.920
So what you really have here is a machine

14:24.920 --> 14:27.040
that can do a kind of error minimization scheme

14:27.040 --> 14:29.400
and start off in different configurations,

14:29.400 --> 14:33.560
but always get to that same place in morphospace.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.200
And this is of course what happens in regeneration.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.840
This guy is an axolotl.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.040
They regenerate their legs, their eyes, their jaws,

14:40.040 --> 14:40.760
and so on.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.920
And you can amputate the limb anywhere.

14:42.920 --> 14:47.120
And these cells will build exactly what's needed

14:47.120 --> 14:49.520
until they get to a correct salamander limb

14:49.520 --> 14:50.720
and then they stop.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.040
This, of course, is the most amazing thing about this.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.680
This process is that it stops.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.560
When does it stop when a correct limb has been formed?

14:58.560 --> 15:00.680
Individual cells don't know anything about what a limb is

15:00.680 --> 15:02.360
or how many fingers you're supposed to have,

15:02.360 --> 15:03.960
but the collective absolutely does.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.440
And it can stop when you get there,

15:05.440 --> 15:07.320
no matter where you started.

15:07.320 --> 15:10.640
It goes beyond this process of problem-solving

15:10.640 --> 15:14.640
goes beyond damage to an existing structure

15:14.640 --> 15:17.320
to what I think of as a good example of really

15:17.360 --> 15:19.760
basal, creative problem-solving.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.240
And it looks like this.

15:21.240 --> 15:25.880
This is a cross-section of a kidney tubule in a nut.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.880
And so usually about eight to 10 cells work together

15:28.880 --> 15:31.160
to create these little tubules.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.920
But if you artificially make the cells very large,

15:33.920 --> 15:35.240
so this is different than damage.

15:35.240 --> 15:38.200
This is not something that normally happens in evolution.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.040
Nuts lose their arms all the time,

15:40.040 --> 15:41.960
but this is quite different.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.640
We've artificially made these cells to be gigantic.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.480
And so what happens is then fewer of them get together

15:47.480 --> 15:50.360
and they make the exact same size lumen.

15:50.360 --> 15:52.680
And the most remarkable thing is that you can make these cells

15:52.680 --> 15:55.320
truly enormous, and the way you do this, by the way,

15:55.320 --> 15:56.320
is you make them polyploid.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.680
So they have multiple copies of their genetic material,

15:59.680 --> 16:01.600
and so the cells get bigger and bigger.

16:01.600 --> 16:05.480
And in that case, one single cell will wrap around itself

16:05.480 --> 16:07.160
and give you the whole lumen.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.400
What's amazing about this example is a couple of things.

16:09.400 --> 16:13.120
Number one, scaling of number to size,

16:13.120 --> 16:14.800
so you can wrap your head around that.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.280
But what's happening here is a completely different molecular

16:17.280 --> 16:17.960
mechanism.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.600
Instead of cell to cell communication,

16:19.600 --> 16:21.680
you're now using cytoskeletal bending.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.080
So this is a good example of top-down causation,

16:25.080 --> 16:28.600
where in the service of a particular anatomical goal,

16:28.600 --> 16:30.400
different molecular mechanisms will

16:30.400 --> 16:33.600
get called up to solve the problem,

16:33.600 --> 16:35.200
to give you the same outcome.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.480
And the second cool thing about this

16:36.480 --> 16:40.240
is that this is really an example of unreliable hardware.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.680
As an embryo, you can't count on how many

16:42.680 --> 16:44.600
copies of your genetic material you have.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.640
You can't count on what the size of your cells are going to be.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.000
You have to figure out how to get the job done,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.600
despite massive amounts of novelty, injuries, uncertainty,

16:53.600 --> 16:55.640
and your own parts and in the environment.

16:55.640 --> 17:00.360
So this is very basal kind of collective problem solving.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.080
And how does all this happen?

17:02.080 --> 17:03.080
How can they do this?

17:03.080 --> 17:06.360
And so amazingly, or maybe looking backwards,

17:06.360 --> 17:09.760
not so amazingly, it happens using the same mechanisms

17:09.800 --> 17:13.200
that the nervous system uses to perform these functions.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.800
So I don't have to tell anybody here

17:14.800 --> 17:16.360
what the hardware and software looks like,

17:16.360 --> 17:20.400
but this idea of ion channels setting up various states

17:20.400 --> 17:23.480
that then drive the physiology that

17:23.480 --> 17:28.520
is thought to underlie various aspects of cognition

17:28.520 --> 17:29.960
and consciousness.

17:29.960 --> 17:33.120
And neuroscience has this project of neural decoding,

17:33.120 --> 17:35.280
where we're going to try to read all of these things

17:35.280 --> 17:38.000
and infer what the creature is thinking,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.920
remembering, experiencing, and so on.

17:39.920 --> 17:44.560
So the kind of salient effect here

17:44.560 --> 17:48.840
is that this system did not arise when brains and neurons came

17:48.840 --> 17:49.360
on the scene.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.640
This is evolutionarily ancient.

17:51.640 --> 17:54.640
And even back at the time of bacterial biofilms,

17:54.640 --> 17:56.360
through the work of Goral Sol, we now

17:56.360 --> 17:58.800
know that even back then, already evolution

17:58.800 --> 18:02.120
was using electrically-based computations

18:02.120 --> 18:04.240
to coordinate across space and time

18:04.240 --> 18:08.280
and to drive specific goal states from collective systems.

18:08.280 --> 18:12.600
And so what we've done is now develop

18:12.600 --> 18:16.080
some of the first tools that are able to read and write

18:16.080 --> 18:17.800
this kind of electrical information out

18:17.800 --> 18:19.360
of non-neural tissues.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.520
So we want to do exactly what neuroscientists try

18:21.520 --> 18:25.000
to do in the brain, but we look at other unconventional

18:25.000 --> 18:28.600
intelligences solving problems in anatomical morphospace.

18:28.600 --> 18:33.880
And so this is a voltage map of a time lapse of a frog embryo

18:33.880 --> 18:36.160
organizing its primary axes.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.720
And we can literally, using these voltage-sensitive dyes,

18:38.720 --> 18:41.720
we can see, interpret, and modify

18:41.720 --> 18:44.320
all of the integrated information

18:44.320 --> 18:46.000
and all the communication that goes on

18:46.000 --> 18:48.960
to enable them to reach collective goals.

18:48.960 --> 18:52.160
And so it's a very parallel system, very much the way

18:52.160 --> 18:56.400
that the bioelectrical events in the brain

18:56.400 --> 18:58.640
are controlling muscles to move you

18:58.640 --> 19:00.600
through three-dimensional space.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.680
This more ancient system is using

19:02.680 --> 19:05.280
bioelectrical events elsewhere in the body, right,

19:05.280 --> 19:09.480
from the moment of fertilization to control all of the cells

19:09.480 --> 19:12.840
to move the configuration of the body through morphospace.

19:12.840 --> 19:13.720
It's the same thing.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.720
And what we think evolution does is basically pivot

19:15.720 --> 19:18.840
the same set of tricks across various spaces.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.560
And so what we can do is we can, of course, we can image this.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.240
And so this is, again, voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes.

19:24.240 --> 19:28.400
This is a video of a frog embryo putting its face together.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.840
And this is one frame.

19:29.840 --> 19:35.680
And long before the genes and the anatomical rearrangements

19:35.680 --> 19:38.840
of the cells begin to form the frog face,

19:38.840 --> 19:41.280
you can already read out this pre-pattern.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.000
Here's you, and I'm showing you this one

19:43.000 --> 19:44.440
because it's the easiest one to decode.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.440
We have others that are a real bear to make sense of.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.840
But this one is pretty obvious.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.080
Here's the animal's right eye.

19:50.080 --> 19:50.760
Here's the mouth.

19:50.760 --> 19:51.840
Here are the placodes.

19:51.840 --> 19:56.080
You can already read the pattern memory in this tissue

19:56.080 --> 19:59.480
that is going to guide the collective activity of the cells

19:59.480 --> 20:03.640
to be able to reach that normal frog target morphology.

20:03.640 --> 20:05.040
And so this is the normal pattern.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.720
This pattern is required for development.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.760
If I perturb this memory, I'll show you in a minute

20:09.760 --> 20:11.360
what you get.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.280
This is a pathological example.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.640
So this is a human oncogene that's

20:15.640 --> 20:19.280
going to basically cause the cells ultimately

20:19.280 --> 20:21.720
to electrically disconnect from their neighbors,

20:21.720 --> 20:24.360
roll back to a unicellular lifestyle,

20:24.360 --> 20:26.160
and their cognitive light cone shrinks

20:26.160 --> 20:29.520
from that of a large organ down to individual cells.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.080
And now, as far as they're concerned,

20:31.080 --> 20:33.200
the rest of the body is just external environment.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.120
They're no longer part of this collective,

20:35.120 --> 20:38.080
and that's tumor genesis and metastasis.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.240
And you can detect this quite readily, this shift.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.360
You can actually see it happening now.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.160
So the way we manipulate these things,

20:44.160 --> 20:47.200
we don't use any kind of electrodes

20:47.200 --> 20:50.040
or applied magnetic fields or anything like that.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.840
We use the native interface that the cells are normally

20:52.880 --> 20:55.160
using to control each other's behavior

20:55.160 --> 20:58.720
and link up into this larger scale intelligence that's

20:58.720 --> 21:02.880
able to move in morphospace and other spaces like that.

21:02.880 --> 21:05.920
So what that means is we can target these gap junctions,

21:05.920 --> 21:07.040
these electrical synapses.

21:07.040 --> 21:10.680
We can control the voltage states directly

21:10.680 --> 21:12.720
using optogenetics, using drugs that

21:12.720 --> 21:14.920
open and close these channels.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.680
We can control the neurotransmitter movement

21:16.680 --> 21:18.080
through these networks.

21:18.080 --> 21:21.680
All the same familiar tools of neuroscience

21:21.680 --> 21:23.760
really do not distinguish between neural tissue

21:23.760 --> 21:24.480
and other tissues.

21:24.480 --> 21:25.200
Everything works.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.000
The tools work, the concepts work.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.880
Everything is readily portable, and so that's what we do.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.120
So I want to show you an example,

21:31.120 --> 21:34.240
and this is just one of many examples of what happens.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.920
I showed you that electric face picture,

21:35.920 --> 21:38.240
and one of the things there was an eye spot.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.200
It was a particular pattern of voltage

21:40.200 --> 21:41.400
that corresponds to an eye.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.720
And we said, what happens if we recreate that same pattern

21:44.720 --> 21:46.200
memory somewhere else in the body?

21:46.200 --> 21:49.280
And so what we did was we injected ion channel RNA

21:49.280 --> 21:50.720
encoding a potassium channel that

21:50.760 --> 21:52.880
sets that particular voltage state.

21:52.880 --> 21:53.600
We encoded it.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.840
We stuck it in some cells that are normally

21:55.840 --> 21:57.280
going to be gut here.

21:57.280 --> 21:58.600
So this is endoderm.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.840
And when you do that, those cells

22:00.840 --> 22:02.560
are happily enough make an eye.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.720
And this eye has all the right lens, and retina,

22:04.720 --> 22:06.640
and optic nerve, and all of that stuff.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.800
Many things we could say about that.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.120
One of the most interesting things about it

22:11.120 --> 22:15.120
is that very much like the kind of scaling

22:15.120 --> 22:17.400
that you see in other collective intelligences,

22:17.400 --> 22:19.000
it has the following property.

22:19.440 --> 22:22.600
This is a lens sitting out in the tail of a tadpole somewhere.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.880
The blue cells are the ones that we actually injected.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.200
But there's not enough of them to make a proper eye.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.080
And they know this.

22:29.080 --> 22:30.960
And what they've done is they've recruited

22:30.960 --> 22:33.200
a bunch of their neighbors, these unmarked,

22:33.200 --> 22:35.520
because they were not directly modified by us,

22:35.520 --> 22:38.080
cells to participate in this eye building project.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.520
So what's happening here is these are all

22:39.520 --> 22:41.080
native competencies of the tissue.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.040
We didn't have to do size control.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.880
We didn't have to tell them how to build an eye,

22:44.880 --> 22:47.880
what all the different gene expressions and cell types.

22:47.880 --> 22:48.880
We have to do any of that.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.840
We put in a very simple prompt or stimulus,

22:52.840 --> 22:54.120
build an eye here.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.800
And all the stuff that's downstream of that,

22:56.800 --> 22:59.240
including the way ants recruit their neighbors

22:59.240 --> 23:01.440
when they have a task that's too big for them,

23:01.440 --> 23:03.080
all of that works.

23:03.080 --> 23:06.040
And so we're starting to see some of these properties

23:06.040 --> 23:08.800
and how to interface with them in the body.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.720
And one of the most important things

23:10.720 --> 23:14.600
is the ability to literally rewrite these pattern memories.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.880
So this is a planarian, these flatworms.

23:16.880 --> 23:18.460
The most amazing thing about them

23:18.500 --> 23:20.220
is that you can cut them into pieces.

23:20.220 --> 23:21.900
And if I cut off the head and the tail,

23:21.900 --> 23:24.180
this middle fragment 100% of the time

23:24.180 --> 23:26.580
regenerates into a nice one-headed worm.

23:26.580 --> 23:27.540
So you can ask the question,

23:27.540 --> 23:29.940
how does it know how many heads it's supposed to have?

23:29.940 --> 23:32.140
And if you actually look at the bioelectrical pattern,

23:32.140 --> 23:36.180
you see this interesting pattern that says one head, one tail.

23:36.180 --> 23:38.380
And what we can do now is we can rewrite that pattern.

23:38.380 --> 23:39.220
This is kind of messy.

23:39.220 --> 23:41.340
The technology is still being worked on.

23:41.340 --> 23:43.660
But you can see what we've done is we've said two heads.

23:43.660 --> 23:46.820
And if you cut this animal, now you get a two-headed worm.

23:46.820 --> 23:47.780
And this is not Photoshop.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.340
These are real animals.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.780
Now, notice something very interesting.

23:51.780 --> 23:54.700
This bioelectrical map that is the map of this

23:54.700 --> 23:59.500
perfectly normal anatomical structure, one-headed creature.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.460
The gene expression is in the right place.

24:01.460 --> 24:02.900
The anatomy is in the right place.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.380
What we've changed is the internal representation

24:05.380 --> 24:07.700
of what a correct planarian looks like.

24:07.700 --> 24:09.940
And they stay normal until you injure them.

24:09.940 --> 24:13.340
If you injure them, then all the cells consult this pattern

24:13.340 --> 24:15.820
and they end up building this different pattern.

24:15.820 --> 24:18.180
So that question that I asked at the very beginning,

24:18.180 --> 24:20.940
how do the regenerating cells know what to make?

24:20.940 --> 24:24.460
They literally store a memory of where in morphospace

24:24.460 --> 24:25.540
they're supposed to go.

24:25.540 --> 24:27.260
That memory is rewritable.

24:27.260 --> 24:31.300
And you can think of this as a very primitive precursor

24:31.300 --> 24:38.300
to our amazing mental time travel capacities

24:38.300 --> 24:40.780
being able to imagine things that haven't happened yet

24:40.780 --> 24:43.140
and remember things that are not happening now.

24:43.140 --> 24:45.180
Because this bioelectrical pattern

24:45.180 --> 24:47.020
is not a map of this two-headed creature.

24:47.020 --> 24:50.620
This is a map of this perfectly normal one-headed animal.

24:50.620 --> 24:53.540
So a single planarian body is able to store at least

24:53.540 --> 24:55.460
two different representations of what

24:55.460 --> 24:57.180
a correct planarian is supposed to look like.

24:57.180 --> 24:58.660
And I'm sure there's lots more.

24:58.660 --> 25:01.100
But this is the one we've nailed down.

25:01.100 --> 25:05.260
So it's a very primitive example of a counterfactual memory.

25:05.260 --> 25:08.460
What would I build if I were to be cut at a future time?

25:08.460 --> 25:09.860
Not what's going on right now.

25:09.860 --> 25:12.540
What's going on right now is this, one head, one tail.

25:12.540 --> 25:13.700
Now, I keep calling it a memory.

25:13.700 --> 25:14.220
Why is that?

25:14.220 --> 25:16.060
Because it has all the properties of memory.

25:16.060 --> 25:18.660
So if I take these two-headed animals, which, by the way,

25:18.660 --> 25:20.460
are genetically perfectly normal.

25:20.460 --> 25:23.660
So the question of what sets the number of heads

25:23.660 --> 25:25.700
in the planarium is not very simple.

25:25.700 --> 25:28.100
It's not that the answer is non-genetics.

25:28.100 --> 25:29.620
Because if I take this two-headed animal

25:29.620 --> 25:31.700
with a perfectly wild type genome,

25:31.700 --> 25:33.300
I can cut him again and again.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.940
And in perpetuity, he will continue

25:35.940 --> 25:39.020
to regenerate as two-headed forms until we set him back.

25:39.020 --> 25:42.060
We know how to rewrite it back to the one-headed state.

25:42.060 --> 25:43.860
And so this question of how many heads

25:43.860 --> 25:47.020
are supposed to be formed, that memory of where do you

25:47.020 --> 25:49.100
go in morphospace to the one-headed region

25:49.100 --> 25:52.100
or the two-headed region, is stored physiologically,

25:52.100 --> 25:52.940
not genetically.

25:52.940 --> 25:54.580
It is long-term stable.

25:54.580 --> 25:55.700
It is rewritable.

25:55.700 --> 25:58.900
I showed you the latency a minute ago, conditional recall,

25:58.900 --> 26:00.780
and it has discrete behaviors.

26:00.780 --> 26:03.420
And here you can see what these two-headed guys do

26:03.420 --> 26:06.060
in terms of when they're hanging out.

26:06.060 --> 26:08.700
So not only can we control head shape this way

26:08.700 --> 26:12.020
by putting these literally false memories

26:12.020 --> 26:16.260
into this collective agent, we can actually think about,

26:16.260 --> 26:19.460
as well, we can actually think about head shape.

26:19.460 --> 26:21.380
So whereas normally, the species would

26:21.380 --> 26:23.180
make a triangular head shape, if we

26:23.180 --> 26:26.660
perturb the network topology, while it's

26:26.660 --> 26:31.700
regenerating just for 48 hours, they can make these normal heads.

26:31.700 --> 26:35.300
But they can also make round heads like an S-Mediterranean

26:35.300 --> 26:36.900
or flat heads like a Pifelina.

26:36.900 --> 26:39.260
These are other species of planaria.

26:39.260 --> 26:42.860
They are, again, genetically untouched,

26:42.860 --> 26:45.940
but there's about 100 million years of genetic distance

26:45.940 --> 26:47.540
between these animals.

26:47.540 --> 26:50.980
And so this, of course, includes the shape of the brain,

26:50.980 --> 26:52.260
the distribution of stem cells.

26:52.260 --> 26:54.340
They become just like these other animals.

26:54.340 --> 26:57.820
And so the same exact hardware can be pushed

26:57.820 --> 27:01.580
to visit other regions of that morphospace.

27:01.580 --> 27:04.500
This is very much like behavior in three-dimensional space.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.460
The hardware can learn many different things.

27:06.460 --> 27:08.860
It doesn't always do the same thing.

27:08.860 --> 27:11.380
And of course, you can get them to hallucinate

27:11.380 --> 27:15.140
kinds of morphologies that are not even

27:15.140 --> 27:17.020
typical for any species of planaria,

27:17.020 --> 27:19.220
such as the spiky forms, cylindrical forms,

27:19.220 --> 27:20.660
and sort of combinations.

27:20.660 --> 27:22.700
So the exact same hardware can be pushed

27:22.700 --> 27:25.740
into lots of different domains.

27:25.740 --> 27:27.300
And so for the last couple of minutes,

27:27.300 --> 27:29.620
I just want to show you one thing.

27:29.620 --> 27:33.540
We were just talking about this anatomical morphospace

27:33.540 --> 27:36.500
and the different shapes that are there and the species that

27:36.500 --> 27:40.140
naturally know how to get to particular regions

27:40.140 --> 27:44.780
and then how you push other types of implementations

27:44.780 --> 27:45.900
into those regions.

27:45.900 --> 27:49.000
But what does the space of possibilities

27:49.000 --> 27:50.980
look like for totally new beings?

27:50.980 --> 27:53.740
So let's make something that has not existed on Earth

27:53.740 --> 27:55.340
before and see what happens.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.540
So this is a project that we did with Josh Bongard's lab

27:58.540 --> 27:59.620
at the University of Vermont.

27:59.620 --> 28:01.540
And Doug Blackeston did all the biology

28:01.540 --> 28:02.980
that I'm showing you here.

28:02.980 --> 28:04.700
So this is an early frog embryo.

28:04.740 --> 28:08.460
At this stage, we take the animal-cap ectoderm.

28:08.460 --> 28:09.100
This is skin.

28:09.100 --> 28:11.100
These are all of these cells are going to become skin.

28:11.100 --> 28:16.820
We dissociate them, cut them away from the embryo,

28:16.820 --> 28:19.420
dissociate them, and put them on their own.

28:19.420 --> 28:20.420
They could do many things.

28:20.420 --> 28:21.340
They could die.

28:21.340 --> 28:22.300
They could spread out.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.060
They could form a two-dimensional monolayer.

28:24.060 --> 28:25.220
They could do nothing.

28:25.220 --> 28:29.820
Instead, what they do is they gather together.

28:29.820 --> 28:34.100
And over the next 24 hours, they're going to come together

28:34.140 --> 28:36.940
and they're going to make this little interesting thing,

28:36.940 --> 28:38.180
which we call a xenobot.

28:38.180 --> 28:40.940
Xenobot because Xenopus laevis is the name of the frog,

28:40.940 --> 28:42.780
and it's a biorebotics platform.

28:42.780 --> 28:45.220
So the interesting thing is that the frog genome certainly

28:45.220 --> 28:46.220
knows how to make this.

28:46.220 --> 28:47.700
This is what we typically see, and this

28:47.700 --> 28:50.060
is what we typically think the frog genome encodes,

28:50.060 --> 28:53.300
a set of developmental stages, and then some behaviors.

28:53.300 --> 28:55.460
But they can also encode this.

28:55.460 --> 28:57.740
This is a xenobot, and it has its own interesting

28:57.740 --> 29:00.060
developmental sequence.

29:00.060 --> 29:02.860
It's never been seen before, and it has interesting behaviors.

29:02.860 --> 29:03.900
What are the behaviors?

29:03.900 --> 29:05.660
Well, the first thing these things do

29:05.660 --> 29:09.020
is they repurpose their little cilia, the little hairs that

29:09.020 --> 29:11.540
normally redistribute mucus down the body of the frog,

29:11.540 --> 29:12.740
and they start to swim.

29:12.740 --> 29:13.940
And they can go in circles.

29:13.940 --> 29:16.140
They can go back and forth like this.

29:16.140 --> 29:17.380
They have collective behaviors.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.020
They have individual behaviors.

29:19.020 --> 29:20.620
Here's one navigating a maze.

29:20.620 --> 29:23.140
So you can see here, remember, there's no nervous system.

29:23.140 --> 29:25.420
This is just skin.

29:25.420 --> 29:26.780
It takes the corner without having

29:26.780 --> 29:28.340
to bump into the opposite wall.

29:28.340 --> 29:31.540
And then here, for no reason that we understand yet,

29:31.540 --> 29:34.300
it has the spontaneous change of heart,

29:34.300 --> 29:37.540
and it turns around and goes back where it comes from.

29:37.540 --> 29:40.380
So these are spontaneously, motile organisms

29:40.380 --> 29:42.700
that have different behaviors.

29:42.700 --> 29:44.540
Here's one amazing behavior.

29:44.540 --> 29:47.860
If you provide them with loose skin cells,

29:47.860 --> 29:51.100
they will run around and collect those skin cells

29:51.100 --> 29:52.380
into little piles.

29:52.380 --> 29:54.220
They will compact them like this.

29:54.220 --> 29:56.660
And because they're dealing with an agential material that

29:56.660 --> 29:59.780
is not passive particles but cells,

29:59.780 --> 30:02.700
these little piles mature into xenobots themselves,

30:02.700 --> 30:03.940
and that's the next generation.

30:03.940 --> 30:04.580
And guess what they do?

30:04.580 --> 30:06.140
They go on and they do the exact same thing,

30:06.140 --> 30:08.140
producing the next generation than the next.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.940
This is called kinematic self-replication.

30:09.940 --> 30:13.260
No other animal on Earth, to our knowledge, does this.

30:13.260 --> 30:17.900
This is completely novel with this kind of construction.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.220
And so they don't have neurons, but they

30:20.220 --> 30:22.340
do have a lot of calcium spiking.

30:22.340 --> 30:24.140
And you can imagine doing all of the things

30:24.140 --> 30:26.260
that neuroscientists do with looking

30:26.260 --> 30:28.900
for transferentropy and mutual information,

30:28.900 --> 30:31.340
all these kinds of things.

30:31.340 --> 30:33.460
So we can ask, what do the cells say to each other?

30:33.460 --> 30:35.860
What do two xenobots say to each other?

30:35.860 --> 30:38.700
We don't know their cognitive capacities.

30:38.700 --> 30:39.900
We're investigating that now.

30:39.900 --> 30:40.700
What can they learn?

30:40.700 --> 30:41.820
What are their preferences?

30:41.820 --> 30:44.380
Really important that we can't make armchair claims about this.

30:44.380 --> 30:45.980
This has to be empirical studies.

30:45.980 --> 30:48.980
So I'm just going to end here with two slides

30:48.980 --> 30:53.860
to say that because biology has to solve all these problems

30:53.860 --> 30:56.060
every time that a being arises into the swirl.

30:56.060 --> 30:57.620
It has to set its boundaries, figure out

30:57.620 --> 30:59.780
what the effectors are, what the sensors are.

30:59.780 --> 31:02.060
And nothing can really be assumed.

31:02.060 --> 31:03.860
It's so interoperable that pretty much

31:03.860 --> 31:07.380
any combination of evolved material at any scale,

31:07.380 --> 31:11.420
designed material, and software, is some kind of agent.

31:11.420 --> 31:14.340
And people are already making cyborgs and hybrids

31:14.340 --> 31:17.740
and every possible combination, which has implications.

31:17.740 --> 31:19.900
We are going to be living in the next few decades

31:19.900 --> 31:25.180
in a huge option space of new bodies and new minds.

31:25.180 --> 31:27.420
Darwin said endless forms are the most beautiful

31:27.420 --> 31:28.660
about the natural forms.

31:28.660 --> 31:30.980
They're a tiny corner of this space.

31:30.980 --> 31:32.620
We're going to have to come up with ways

31:32.620 --> 31:35.940
to relate to beings that are nowhere on our tree of life.

31:35.940 --> 31:37.940
So these old criteria of what do you look like

31:37.940 --> 31:40.980
and how did you get here are not going to be useful anymore.

31:40.980 --> 31:42.940
And all of these binary categories

31:42.940 --> 31:45.500
are going to wash away as well.

31:45.500 --> 31:48.420
Because when people make claims about machines and robots

31:48.420 --> 31:51.540
and organisms, it's just very difficult to support

31:51.540 --> 31:53.980
any kind of clean separation.

31:54.020 --> 31:57.740
I'm going to stop here and just summarize what I've

31:57.740 --> 32:02.260
tried to say is that biological systems solve and operate

32:02.260 --> 32:04.780
in all kinds of spaces.

32:04.780 --> 32:06.780
They have behavioral competencies that

32:06.780 --> 32:09.180
include memory and learning and problem solving,

32:09.180 --> 32:13.260
navigation, representation, perceptible by stability,

32:13.260 --> 32:14.940
active inference, and so on.

32:14.940 --> 32:16.780
The underlying mechanisms are also the same.

32:16.780 --> 32:19.980
They use ion channels, electrical synapses, neurotransmitters,

32:19.980 --> 32:21.460
microtubules, electric fields.

32:21.460 --> 32:23.740
All of that is present in all of the structures

32:24.100 --> 32:25.100
of bodies.

32:25.100 --> 32:26.580
And if these are the kinds of things

32:26.580 --> 32:28.980
that we think are associated with consciousness,

32:28.980 --> 32:31.620
we have to take very seriously the possibility

32:31.620 --> 32:33.180
that there are other unconventional

32:33.180 --> 32:36.020
consciousnesses in our bodies and increasingly

32:36.020 --> 32:40.420
being made by engineering kinds of efforts.

32:40.420 --> 32:44.780
And to me, just taking a step back of how

32:44.780 --> 32:47.500
we think about these things, all agency claims

32:47.500 --> 32:50.740
are really protocol claims for how you can optimally relate

32:50.740 --> 32:51.780
to that system.

32:51.780 --> 32:55.260
And so as an engineer, I want to guess correctly

32:55.260 --> 32:58.300
for various systems is where I am on this spectrum.

32:58.300 --> 33:00.220
But of course, it's not just about engineering.

33:00.220 --> 33:01.860
It's also about relationships.

33:01.860 --> 33:05.100
And people are trying to develop sort of proof of humanity

33:05.100 --> 33:06.420
certificates and so on.

33:06.420 --> 33:08.820
And the question then becomes, what do you really

33:08.820 --> 33:10.300
want when you have proof of humanity?

33:10.300 --> 33:12.780
Are you looking for proof of native DNA?

33:12.780 --> 33:15.340
Are you looking for proof of native anatomical structure

33:15.340 --> 33:17.900
or something that we explore here, which is really

33:17.900 --> 33:20.820
a kind of competency for compassion that maybe that's

33:20.820 --> 33:21.900
the more important thing?

33:21.900 --> 33:23.580
And this is an example.

33:23.580 --> 33:25.140
Midjourney is an AI system that I

33:25.140 --> 33:29.740
asked to draw its vision of two synthetic organisms in love.

33:29.740 --> 33:31.900
And this is what it drew.

33:31.900 --> 33:36.140
So if anybody's interested, especially these two papers

33:36.140 --> 33:38.660
are relevant, but there's a whole bunch of work on this.

33:38.660 --> 33:41.700
And I want to thank all the people who

33:41.700 --> 33:43.060
did the work that I showed you today

33:43.060 --> 33:46.620
and all our many collaborators, of course, and our funders.

33:46.620 --> 33:47.700
And I thank you for listening.

33:50.820 --> 33:51.820
Thank you.
