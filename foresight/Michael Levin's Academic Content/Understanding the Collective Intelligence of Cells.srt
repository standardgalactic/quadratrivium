1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Okay, so it's a great pleasure today for me to introduce Professor Michael Levin.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,360
He's a distinguished professor at Tufts University, as well as the Vannevar Bush professor.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,520
And he's also director of the Allen Discovery Center and the Tufts Center for Regenerative

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,080
and Developmental Biology.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:31,920
And I'm sure everyone here have heard about his work on Xenobots, which I've been told

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,320
there'll be some of that at the end of his talks.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:42,440
So Michael has requested that we refrain from asking deep questions until the end.

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,000
So just clarification questions throughout the talk so that we can get to the really

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,400
exciting parts.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,200
Okay, so take it away.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Thank you.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Thank you so much.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,960
And thank you for having me and giving me the opportunity to share some ideas with you.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,120
All of the details and if you would like to contact me, which would be great, you can

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,800
find me at these two websites.

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,560
So what I want to talk about today is our sort of perspective on collective intelligence

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,840
and in particular cellular behavior as a kind of collective intelligence.

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,760
So I often start by thinking about Alan Turing, who of course needs no introduction, was very

19
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:29,480
interested in intelligence, in cognition and various embodiments, and in particular in

20
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:36,240
problem-solving machines, this idea that intelligence can be manifest through plasticity or reprogrammability.

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,800
And so we all know that.

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,600
Some people may or may not know that he was also interested in morphogenesis, the generation

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,760
of biological shape.

24
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,880
And it's often, one might wonder, why would the same person who was interested in intelligence

25
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,640
be interested in the kinds of questions that biologists tend to, developmental biologists

26
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,640
in particular tend to deal with.

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,640
And I think he saw a very deep symmetry between these two fields, which is, I think, very

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,840
important and still not really appreciated sufficiently.

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,400
So this is what we work on.

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,000
In particular, the idea of problem-solving living machines.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,200
And one thing that we have to think about as we drill down in the biology and we look

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,440
to see what we are all made of is this idea that this traditional distinction between,

33
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,760
we look at things like termite mounds and bee colonies and blard flocks and we say, okay,

34
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,880
that's perhaps a kind of collective intelligence, but we are true sort of centralized intelligences.

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,040
And of course, the idea is that actually all intelligence, certainly in biology as well

36
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,640
as collective intelligence, because we are all made of parts and components.

37
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,800
And in fact, the Ambricard Sole calls this kind of thing a liquid brain in the sense

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,480
that the components are not fixed with respect to their spatial relationships.

39
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,120
So this is the sort of thing of which we are made.

40
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,440
This is a single cell.

41
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
This is called a lacrimaria.

42
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,200
Of course, this is a free-living organism.

43
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
It's one cell.

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
It has no brain.

45
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,720
It has no nervous system.

46
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,000
It is extremely competent in its local sort of environment with its local goals.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So it's physiological.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's anatomical.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,600
It's behavioral goals.

50
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,880
It's very competent without the typical things that we associate with intelligence.

51
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,520
And the really critical part is to realize is that all of us make this amazing journey

52
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,440
from what people call just physics to cognition.

53
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:41,280
So we were all at one point a quiescent oocyte, so a little pile of chemicals doing something

54
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,480
like this where specific molecules interact with other molecules.

55
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,400
But eventually, through this process of embryonic development, we become something like this

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,560
or maybe even something like that.

57
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,440
And so the thing about this process is that it's extremely slow and gradual.

58
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,960
There is no special point at which a magic lightning flash sort of says, okay, now you

59
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
are cognitive.

60
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
Before that, you were just physics.

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,080
In chemistry, now you are a true cognitive individual.

62
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
That doesn't happen.

63
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,560
So we need to understand this scale up.

64
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,200
We need to understand what happens from the time that we are this to the time that we

65
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
are that.

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,420
So the main points today that I would like to talk about is this idea of biology's multi-scale

67
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,520
competency architecture, which is a set of nested problem solvers in different spaces.

68
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,600
And one kind of invariant to all of this is navigation.

69
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,720
I want to spend the most of my time on this example, although there are many other examples,

70
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,680
of anatomical control and specifically this idea of navigating morpho space.

71
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,280
And I will talk a lot about bioelectrical networks as not only the mediator of kind

72
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:54,080
of the coagum, the glue that binds the neurons together into a coherent emergent intelligence,

73
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,000
but also of a much more ancient roles for that same mechanism.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,840
And this has many applications, for example, on biomedicine.

75
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,320
And at the end, I want to talk a little bit about synthetic bioengineering.

76
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,440
I want to show you some novel creatures that have never existed before and talk a little

77
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,720
bit about what this means for evolution and for many other fields.

78
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,200
So single cells come in all shapes and sizes.

79
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
This is a single cell.

80
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
So this is a diatom.

81
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
They are very tiny.

82
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,760
So this is a single cell.

83
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,000
This is also a single cell.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,840
This thing, which looks like a plant, it has a nice cap and a stalk and some roots here.

85
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,200
It's actually an alga, the whole thing could be up to 10 centimeters in size.

86
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,680
It's also a single cell.

87
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,800
So if you're interested in morphogenesis by differentiating cells into different types,

88
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,680
we already start to see that there's structure well below that.

89
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,840
This thing has one nucleus and it manages to make this amazing shape without any differentiation.

90
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,320
Cells are also competent in behavioral spaces.

91
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,360
So what you're looking at here, this is a slime mold called physarum polycephalum.

92
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,920
It has many nuclei, but it's still one cell.

93
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,560
The whole thing is one cell.

94
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,520
And what you can do is you can do this.

95
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,360
You can put some objects in its vicinity.

96
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,280
These white things are glass discs.

97
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,240
They have no chemical on them, no food, nothing.

98
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,640
They're completely inert.

99
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,240
And if you put three on one side and one on the other, it will consistently choose to

100
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,640
travel towards the three.

101
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,680
What it's actually doing as we showed in this paper is it's actually sensing strain angle

102
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
in the medium.

103
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,480
It is incredibly sensitive to it.

104
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,520
And it's pulsing, which you can't see here, but it's pulsing as a kind of sonar to build

105
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,640
a map of its surroundings and migrate towards the heavier object.

106
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,480
And what's kind of cool is that at this point here, for the first four hours, it sort of

107
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,840
grows in all directions.

108
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,400
And this is the point at which it's got enough information and now, boom, now it knows where

109
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,560
to go at that point.

110
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,000
But right here, you still can't really, you don't really know.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,440
But at this point, bang, it starts to.

112
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,560
So there are all sorts of, so this is kind of the field of basal cognition and trying

113
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,520
to understand how biology was solving various problems long before brains and neurons appeared.

114
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,920
So I want to talk about three or four things today.

115
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,880
The first thing I want to do is I want to twist some knobs on traditional cognitive

116
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:18,040
science and talk about some unconventional agents that we can start thinking about.

117
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:25,520
So this kind of picture, this is the classic painting of Adam naming the animals in the

118
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,280
Garden of Eden.

119
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,400
This kind of picture is really pretty prevalent in a lot of discussions, in the sense that

120
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:40,280
people really think about finished adult organisms as the subjects of their study.

121
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,520
So intelligence, they say the human brain or the rat or something like this.

122
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,760
And what I want to do is stretch this in a number of dimensions, both in terms of the

123
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:56,000
time evolution, the fact that everything comes from one cell at one point, and also the fact

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,280
that drawing boundaries between different types of creatures is actually very difficult

125
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,520
because of the interoperability of life and the ability to make chimeras.

126
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,400
So the first thing we can think about is this.

127
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,360
This is a caterpillar.

128
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,560
This is a kind of soft-bodied robot that crawls around and it chews plants and it lives in

129
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,440
a two-dimensional world.

130
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,080
It has to turn into this.

131
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,120
This is a completely different hard-bodied kind of creature which has to fly in a three-dimensional

132
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
world.

133
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,560
It doesn't care about leaves anymore, but it does want nectar.

134
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,480
And so the behavioral and all of these repertoires are completely different.

135
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,120
So during this time, what happens is the brain basically liquefies.

136
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,920
Most of the connections are broken.

137
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,360
Most of the neurons die.

138
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,920
It gets reassembled and rebuilt into a brand new brain suitable for driving, this kind

139
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,320
of creature.

140
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,000
And one of the most amazing things is, and there are many examples that you can read

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,040
about here, is that if you train this animal to have particular memories, those memories

142
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,720
are recovered in the moth or butterfly that comes out.

143
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,420
So despite the complete rewiring of the brain here, those memories remain.

144
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,920
So as computer scientists, we can start thinking about, okay, what kind of medium could we

145
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:14,000
have that is able to store information that survives radical remodeling of the structure

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
of the medium.

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,560
But this metamorphosis is very interesting because this is not just evolutionary timescales.

148
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,160
This is a single individual.

149
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,480
So if you're into philosophy of mind and you wonder what's it like to be a caterpillar

150
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,480
or a butterfly, here's kind of the next level question.

151
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,800
What's it like to be a caterpillar turning into a butterfly?

152
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,880
What is the experience of this process as your cognitive medium is being completely reshaped?

153
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,640
Biology goes even further.

154
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
These are plenaria.

155
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
These are flatworms.

156
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,120
You'll hear lots more about them later.

157
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,400
Interesting thing about them, well, several interesting things.

158
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,560
One is that you can cut them into pieces and every piece regenerates and becomes a completely

159
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,840
normal worm.

160
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,640
But what you could, and so they have a true brain, all the same neurotransmitters that

161
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,480
you and I have centralized nervous system.

162
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,560
What you can do is you can train them to expect food on these little laser-etched kind of

163
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,000
a bumpy surfaces, cut off their heads.

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,920
The tail sits there doing nothing for about 10 days and then they regrow a brand new brain

165
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,080
and then you find out that the animal actually remembers where to find the food.

166
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,840
So the memory survives complete decapitation.

167
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,160
So the interesting thing about that is, okay, somehow it's stored in the rest of the tissue,

168
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,960
maybe neural, maybe not neural, we don't know, fine.

169
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:34,040
But also that information has to be imprinted onto the new brain that is constructed from

170
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
scratch.

171
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,360
So this idea of moving information around and what happens to cognitive information as

172
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,400
anatomical information is being processed is really interesting, right?

173
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,280
That's the nexus at which we do most of our work.

174
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,040
And so now, finally, I want to show you an example.

175
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,560
This bears on some of the evolutionary topics where this is a tadpole of a frog.

176
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,160
So here are the nostrils, here's the mouth, here's the brain, here's the gut, here's the

177
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
tail.

178
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,680
Now you'll notice something very strange is that here with the eyes should be here, but

179
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
they're missing.

180
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
Instead, there's one on the tail.

181
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,600
And we engineered it this way and I can talk later about how that's done.

182
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,760
But the interesting thing is that when you make a tadpole with an eye on its tail, despite

183
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,720
the fact that for millions of years, everything was perfectly set up to expect visual input

184
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,120
from two regions right here into the optic tectum, these animals can see quite well.

185
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,200
So we can do a tadpole, we made a machine that tests their learning and visual assays.

186
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,240
This eye, in fact, makes an optic nerve.

187
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,840
It synapses on the spinal cord, not on the brain.

188
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,120
And that apparently is sufficient for the brain to recognize this.

189
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,320
So you can imagine this weird sort of information bus onto which this organ is putting some

190
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,320
sort of data and the brain says, oh yes, I know what that is.

191
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,760
That's visual data, even though it's coming in from a completely bizarre location.

192
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,200
No problem, right?

193
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,160
So that kind of plasticity is going to be a major, major theme today because one of

194
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,360
the things that I think is a constant theme in biology is that it does not over-train

195
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,720
on priors, meaning that it plays the hands that it's dealt at any given moment.

196
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:18,160
What evolution is making is hardware that is very good at dealing with a novelty because

197
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,240
it doesn't actually have exact expectations and we'll get to some of that later.

198
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,120
So the interesting thing, what I think makes all of that work, which of course is very

199
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,280
challenging, we're still struggling to make technology like that, what makes all of this

200
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:38,440
work is this multi-scale competency architecture where not only is biology nested dolls kind

201
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,080
of at the structural level, that's obvious, everybody knows that.

202
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:47,760
But actually, not only functionally but computationally, every level is solving different problems

203
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,360
in their own space.

204
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,120
And so I've been working on a framework, which I don't have time to really get into the details,

205
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,880
but if anybody's interested, I can give you a link, that is going to enable us to think

206
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,640
about very diverse intelligences, not only the kinds of things that people typically

207
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:11,080
think about, but also to weird creatures, colonial swarms and bacterial mats and engineered

208
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,160
new life forms and AIs and maybe alien life forms, whatever.

209
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:23,200
And it's based in part on this kind of approach where, and this is from an old paper in the

210
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,720
40s about setting up a scale of cognitive sophistication all the way from very simple

211
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,240
to quite advanced, with the idea being that there's nothing here about nerves and brains

212
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,800
and whatnot, it's a cybernetic approach that's very substrate independent and I think that's

213
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,040
really important as we start to come up with frameworks that are really enable us to, for

214
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,400
example, recognize alien intelligences.

215
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,080
So what we think about is competency in diverse spaces.

216
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,240
Now, the thing that human beings are very good at is recognizing intelligence of medium

217
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,920
sized objects moving at medium speeds through three dimensional space, all our sense organs

218
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,320
are sort of pointed that way, we're good at recognizing that.

219
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,400
So we know when crows and things are doing intelligent navigation of three dimensional

220
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,880
space, but actually life is navigating all kinds of really interesting spaces.

221
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,600
So there's the space of possible gene expressions, and there's the space of possible physiological

222
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
states.

223
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,800
And then there's this, which we'll spend the most time talking about, which is morphospace.

224
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,520
This is the space of possible anatomical configurations.

225
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:34,200
So what I want to do next is talk about morphogenesis, the generation of body structure as the behavior

226
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,720
of a collective intelligence of cells in this morphospace.

227
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,520
So we want to think a little bit differently here.

228
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,160
Let's ask a fundamental question.

229
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,160
This is a cross section through a human torso.

230
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,520
Look at this amazing order, all of this, the tissues, the organs, everything is in exactly

231
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,000
the right place, the right orientation, relative to the right size.

232
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,760
Where does this structure come from?

233
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,720
You would think that it would take an incredible amount of information to specify all this.

234
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,360
And by the way, what would that information even look like?

235
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,600
What would the encoding and decoding be?

236
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,160
Because we all start life like this as a collection of embryonic plastomeres.

237
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,520
So I ask where is this information?

238
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,440
And people intuitively nowadays will say, well, it's in the DNA, it's in the genome.

239
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,440
But we can read genomes now, and we know what's in the genome.

240
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,880
What's in the genome are protein sequences, the specification of a micro-level hardware

241
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,160
that every cell gets to have.

242
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,400
There's nothing in the genome directly about any of this.

243
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:37,280
And so there's really a very deep set of questions about how does the cellular collective know

244
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
what to make?

245
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,720
How does it know when to stop?

246
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,960
If a piece is missing as regenerative medicine workers, we would like to know how to convince

247
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,640
the cells to build it again.

248
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,480
And as engineers, and we'll get to this in the last part of the talk, we might ask, well,

249
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,840
what else is possible given those exact same cells?

250
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,920
What else can we get them to build with the same hardware?

251
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:01,400
And so the reason that this kind of question is important is this.

252
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,000
In addition to all the basic stuff, for the biology audiences, I always point out that

253
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,200
pretty much every aspect of medicine with the exception of infectious disease, everything

254
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,040
else, birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would

255
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,560
be completely solved if we knew how to tell collections of cells what to build.

256
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,000
If we could specify what three-dimensional structure we wanted the cells to build, all

257
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,240
of this would go away.

258
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,520
And so we can think about the future where this is kind of the end game for this whole

259
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,800
field is what we really want as a kind of anatomical compiler.

260
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,040
We want to sit down and draw the animal or plant that we want, not at the level of gene

261
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,240
pathways or anything like that.

262
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,560
You want to be able to draw the final goal here.

263
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,800
I want a three-headed platform like this and with this kind of nervous system.

264
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,880
This is what I want.

265
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,000
And if we knew what we were doing, this compiler would take that description and convert it

266
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,800
to a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells to get them to build exactly

267
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
that.

268
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,080
Now, we don't have anything remotely like this, despite all the incredible progress in

269
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,320
genetics and biology.

270
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Why not?

271
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,440
Well, here's one simple example.

272
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,920
This is a baby axolotl.

273
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,440
So axolotls are kind of salamander.

274
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,320
This is a baby axolotl.

275
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,760
Baby axolotls have legs.

276
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,280
This is the tadpole of a frog.

277
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Frogs don't have legs.

278
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,080
Now, one of the things you can make is you can make a chimeric embryo.

279
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,280
We call it a frog-a-lottel.

280
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,000
We're making these in our lab.

281
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,240
And so I would pose this challenge.

282
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,140
We have the genome for the axolotl.

283
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,360
We have the genome for the frog.

284
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,720
We have all the genetic information.

285
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,160
Now, I ask a simple question.

286
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,800
Will frog-a-lottels have legs or not?

287
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,560
And there are no models in the field that will help you answer that question, none.

288
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,160
Because even though we know a lot about the molecular pathways that are involved at the

289
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,320
cellular level, we really don't understand very well how large-scale decisions are made.

290
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,400
And in particular, not only can't we tell what the chimer is going to do, to be honest,

291
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,320
we can't even tell what the individual is going to do.

292
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,080
If you didn't already know what an axolotl was or you were able to compare that genome

293
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:05,120
to other genomes, you would have no idea what the shape or the other properties of the animal

294
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
were by looking at the genome.

295
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,480
So where we are is this in biology.

296
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,240
We're very good at this kind of thing.

297
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,120
We're very good at manipulating cells and molecules and getting this kind of information.

298
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,320
What we really want is something like this.

299
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,000
We would like to be able to control large-scale anatomy.

300
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,560
And to me, it reminds me of where computer science was a long time ago, where really

301
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,640
one of the things you had to do was you always had to interact at the hardware level.

302
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,080
So you would rewire the thing to get it to do something different.

303
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,400
And this is where modern molecular medicine is.

304
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,400
All of the exciting approaches are CRISPR genome editing.

305
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,880
It's basically this.

306
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,040
It's trying to manipulate the absolute lowest level.

307
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,120
And I think we can do way better than that because evolution doesn't do this.

308
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:56,440
Evolution exploits these amazing higher-level interfaces that we can now exploit as well.

309
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,480
That give you access to all kinds of computation, modularity, and all kinds of other interesting

310
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
things.

311
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,200
So one of the things that we're interested in is a degree of intelligence.

312
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,880
And by intelligence, I don't mean, of course, human-level intelligence.

313
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:16,120
I mean something along the lines of that cybernetic kind of scale that Weiner gave us.

314
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,760
And William James agreed.

315
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,880
He said that intelligence is the ability to reach the same goal by different means.

316
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,960
So this is, again, a very substrate-independent kind of functional definition.

317
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,040
And so what I want to talk about in terms of this anatomy is this idea of an anatomical

318
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,200
morphospace.

319
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,400
So it's a virtual space of possible anatomical configurations.

320
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,560
This is a simple example.

321
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,040
These are snail shells.

322
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,560
And every kind of a shell can be generated by an equation with three parameters.

323
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,320
So you can build a three-dimensional kind of space.

324
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,200
And every existing snail shell is somewhere in this space.

325
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,560
And then there are lots of regions.

326
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,200
And we can sort of argue about why those regions aren't populated by real organisms and so on.

327
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:03,920
And so let's think about how much, if any, intelligence does a collection of cells have

328
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,120
in navigating this morphospace.

329
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,680
Well, here's the very kind of simplest thing you can do is you can take an early embryo.

330
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,200
You can cut it in half.

331
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,200
And what you don't get are two half bodies.

332
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,320
What you actually get are two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.

333
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,000
So you start to get this idea that development is reliable, but it isn't hardwired because

334
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,840
if you introduce changes, it can still get to where it's going.

335
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,960
So there are a variety of starting states.

336
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,720
Maybe there are some local minima.

337
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,280
But what it knows how to do is get around and get to a correct final state.

338
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,880
This is being cut in half is not the normal state of affairs for embryos, but no problem.

339
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,320
They can still get there even when half the cells are missing.

340
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,640
Now this is a regeneration which works in a similar fashion.

341
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,520
There's our axolotl.

342
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,600
Axolotl's regenerate their eyes, their limbs, their jaws, which is absolutely amazing.

343
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,980
And so what you can do is you can cut this limb anywhere along the length.

344
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,160
It will build exactly what's missing, no more, no less, and then it stops.

345
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,680
That's maybe the most amazing part of this process is this idea that it actually knows

346
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,600
when to stop.

347
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
When does it stop?

348
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,880
Well, it stops when a correct salamander arm has been produced.

349
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:21,000
So this is some kind of means and thing going on here where when the error is low enough,

350
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
that's when it stops.

351
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,800
And by the way, humans of course are not like axolotl's, but we can regenerate something.

352
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,480
So the liver is highly regenerative.

353
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,320
Human children regenerate their fingertips below a certain age, and deer regenerate huge

354
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,160
amounts of bone and vasculature and innervation every year.

355
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,360
So you can think about some of these examples.

356
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,960
Now the other kind of competency that these cells have is really amazing, which is that

357
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,760
I've shown you that as an embryo, you can't count on how many cells you have.

358
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,400
So you have to be able to produce embryogenesis even when behalf of your cells are missing.

359
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,560
But it turns out you can't even count on how much DNA you have or how big your cells are.

360
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,440
So one thing you can do, this is kind of one of my favorite examples, this is a cross-section

361
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,720
through a kidney tubule in a nuke, and normally it's 8 to 10 cells and they sort of work together

362
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,280
to build this kind of tube, and here's a cross-section through that.

363
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,720
What you can do, you can do this trick where early on in development you can prevent the

364
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,040
cells from dividing for a bit, the DNA accumulates, every cell ends up with multiple copies of

365
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,960
the genome, and then you let it go, and then development proceeds, but the cells are now

366
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
much larger.

367
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
They're huge.

368
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,880
So no problem, despite the fact that you have too many copies of all your instructions

369
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,720
in every cell, and the cells are huge, what will happen is a smaller number of those cells

370
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,640
will work together to give you exactly the same structure, so they adjust to the cell

371
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
size.

372
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,000
But even better than that, if you make the cells truly gigantic by having eight times

373
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,560
the amount of DNA in the original egg, what will happen is one cell will bend around itself,

374
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,280
leaving a hole in the middle and give you the exact same tubule.

375
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,600
Now what's cool about this is that this is top-down causation.

376
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,800
This is the idea that cells will choose different molecular mechanisms to get the same job done

377
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,120
at the anatomical level.

378
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,160
So in service of getting the same large-scale structure, here what the cells are harnessing

379
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,840
are cell-to-cell communication, here what the harnessing is cytoskeletal bending, completely

380
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,000
different molecular mechanisms to get to the same step.

381
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,760
So the idea is that this hardware that evolution has given us is able to make up for drastic

382
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,520
changes of its component parts.

383
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,540
And the final example, and so that last example was known since the 40s, it was discovered

384
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:48,360
a long time ago, this is recent here, this is our work, and it's just a simple example

385
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,200
of this kind of navigating morpho space.

386
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,760
So here's your tadpole here, now this one has normal eyes, this is a normal tadpole,

387
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,720
and it becomes a normal frog.

388
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,200
But in order to do that, it has to rearrange its face, so the jaws have to move, the eyes

389
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,080
have to move forward, the nostrils have to extend, like everything has to move.

390
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,840
The traditional way of thinking about this was that, well, somehow the genome encodes

391
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,000
some hard-wired cell behaviors so that every tissue moves the right direction in the right

392
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,020
amount, and then you get your normal frog from the normal starting position.

393
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,840
So we wanted to test this hypothesis, and we thought that actually, no, probably it's

394
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,440
much more clever than that.

395
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,400
So what we did was we created what we call Picasso tadpoles.

396
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,040
So everything is in the wrong place, the eyes are in the side of the head, the mouth is

397
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,160
on top, everything is scrambled.

398
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,160
And the amazing thing is that these scrambled tadpoles still become pretty normal frogs,

399
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:42,160
because all of these organs starting off at the incorrect position will move around until

400
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,360
they get to where they're going, in fact, sometimes they go too far and actually have

401
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,720
to double back, but everything will move around until it lands in this correct orientation,

402
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
and then it stops.

403
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,560
So what evolution actually gave us is some kind of an error minimization scheme that

404
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,840
is able to make up for drastic defects.

405
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,640
This has massive implications for evolution, because it means that if you have mutations

406
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,480
that move your mouth off kilter or move your eye to your tail or do some kind of crazy

407
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,760
thing like this, it isn't necessarily the end.

408
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,560
And if they have other kinds of positive implications elsewhere in the body, now you get to explore

409
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,960
those, because these organs are fairly competent in getting where they need to go, connecting

410
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,400
up in the however they need to connect up and giving you some kind of functionality.

411
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,280
It tends to smooth the evolutionary landscape by a massive amount.

412
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:37,320
This whole kind of homeostatic process suggests that this basic emergent story that molecular

413
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,120
biology tells in the textbooks, basically that the standard view of things is this,

414
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,320
is that it's a feed-forward emergent process, basically that there are genes interacting

415
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,680
with each other, some of them make proteins that do things, they're sticky or they diffuse

416
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,480
or something, so there's this physics, and then there's this process of emergence.

417
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,880
So simple rules, executed in parallel over massive amounts of tiny agents give you an

418
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
emergent outcome.

419
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,040
And this is true, of course this is true, all of this does happen, but I think it's

420
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:12,400
massively incomplete, because one of the problems with this feed-forward kind of story is that

421
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,160
in addition to evolutionary issues, if you as an engineer or a bio-worker in regenerative

422
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:25,080
medicine, if you wanted to make a change up here, and this was truly a feed-forward process,

423
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,840
you would have no idea what to do back here, because reversing this is impossible, this

424
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:34,160
is a terrible inverse problem, and if you decided that you know I like this ax a little

425
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,880
but it's missing a leg, or instead I want it to be a three-fold symmetry instead of

426
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,200
bilateral symmetry, what genes would you change?

427
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,560
We have absolutely no idea how to reverse this, I don't think it's a solvable problem.

428
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:50,040
And as a result, the gains of things like genomic editing and CRISPR and so on, I think

429
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,520
are going to hit a glass ceiling, because for the vast majority of problems, we don't

430
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,320
know what to do down here.

431
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,640
So what we focus on in our group is these feedback loops, the idea that what's actually

432
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:07,760
going on here is that there are systems that measure error, they measure deviation from

433
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,960
a set point, and then they activate both at the genetic level and at the level of physics,

434
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,480
and this is what we'll talk about for the next bit, they try to get you closer to your

435
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
set point.

436
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,680
Now on the one hand, biologists of course know all about homeostasis and set points,

437
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,680
but there are two weird things going on here.

438
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,480
One is that the set point, unlike a typical biological set point, which might be metabolic

439
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,360
level or pH or temperature or something like that, this is a complex data structure, this

440
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,560
is some kind of anatomical descriptor of what this thing is supposed to look like.

441
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,520
How do you store that kind of set point?

442
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,920
The other thing is that it suggests that this whole system in a certain sense is goal-directed.

443
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:55,640
Now not magically so, but in a cybernetic sense, like a thermostat, but still, biology

444
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,800
doesn't, molecular biology and so on doesn't love discussing goals and things like that,

445
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,320
even though we now have a perfectly good engineering science of it.

446
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,960
What this kind of view does though is that it makes a very strong prediction, it predicts

447
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,240
that if we wanted to make changes up here, if this is all true and there is some kind

448
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,480
of a set point being stored and it's not purely feed-forward emergence, then what we

449
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,080
should be able to do is find how that set point is being stored, learn to read it, learn

450
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,480
to rewrite it, and then the cells would build something else without having to make any

451
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,240
changes to the hardware down here.

452
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,040
In other words, if it's true that there's some degree of reprogrammability, this idea

453
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:41,720
that the collective compares to a pattern memory, builds to that pattern, we could change

454
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,040
the pattern and not have to actually rewire the machine.

455
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,200
How general is this?

456
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,640
What else can these cells do?

457
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,560
You can see this now tying back into the themes that I started off with, touring and such.

458
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,960
For the next part of the talk, I want to show you an example of how this works because we've

459
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,160
been looking for this and we think we found it and we've started to learn to read and

460
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,840
write it.

461
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,320
The medium of all of this, maybe not terribly surprising for any neuroscientist, is bioelectricity.

462
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,760
How does this work in the brain?

463
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,360
Real quick, just the hardware looks like this, there's a collection of cells in the network.

464
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,040
They have ion channels which enable voltage states to exist and maybe propagate to their

465
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,840
neighbors via these electrical synapses known as gap junctions, so that's the hardware.

466
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,320
The commitment of neuroscience is that all of the electrophysiology that goes on, and

467
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:40,400
so this group made an amazing video of zebrafish brain activity in a live fish thinking about

468
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,960
whatever it is that fish think about, that the idea is that all of the memories, the

469
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:54,640
goals, the cognitive content of that mind is embedded in this electrical activity and

470
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,080
thus there's the idea of neural decoding.

471
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,160
If we understood the encoding, we should be able to read out the physiological activity

472
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:08,600
and then understand what the animal was thinking about or what its memories were and that kind

473
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
of thing.

474
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,560
It turns out that this same exact system works everywhere in your body, so this is an extremely

475
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,920
ancient set of tools that the evolution uses.

476
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,600
Every cell in your body has ion channels, most cells in your body have the exact same

477
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,800
electrical synapses, there are neural transmitter signaling in most tissues of the body and

478
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,400
so we can now think about a similar project.

479
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,400
What about neuroscience outside of neurons?

480
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,360
What if we could decode the electrical conversations that other cells were having with each other

481
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:47,840
and understand how this kind of electrical glue was functioning outside of the brain

482
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,680
and so this is an early frog embryo using very similar technology, we developed voltage-sensitive

483
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,800
dye imaging, so the colors are voltages, they're of course very slowly changing compared to

484
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,640
this, but you can, this is a time lapse over about 12 hours, you can see all the electrical

485
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,480
conversations that the cells have with each other and all the patterning that goes on.

486
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,080
Now we know what brains think about, they think about behavior in three-dimensional spaces

487
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:20,720
and maybe linguistic spaces, what does the rest of the body think about using that same

488
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
process?

489
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,200
Well, whereas in the brain what you have here is you have an electrical network issuing

490
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,400
commands to muscles to move the body through three-dimensional space, there's a very isomorphic

491
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:41,080
kind of picture where actually long before that what the system was doing was issuing

492
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:47,200
commands to individual cells to move the configuration of your body through morpho space, right?

493
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,720
So what we think evolution did was this was first and then what it simply did was to pivot

494
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,080
this whole thing to motion spaces instead of anatomical spaces.

495
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,920
So we started, we got our inspiration from neuroscience, we steal a lot of tools and

496
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:08,760
concepts from the neuroscientists and so here are some of the tools we use.

497
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,560
First of all, we can do the imaging to see what the electrical activity is, we do a lot

498
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:19,000
of quantitative simulation to understand how the voltages arise from the various ion channel

499
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,560
activity, here's what some of these things look like, this is an early frog embryo putting

500
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,520
its face together and one of the things you can see and so the grayscale here is the

501
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:39,560
bioelectric voltage potentials across the tissue and this is one frame from that tissue,

502
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:44,800
from that video, what you can see is that long before the genes turn on to actually pattern

503
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:51,600
the face and long before the face really appears, you can already read out a pre-pattern, a

504
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,920
bioelectrical pre-pattern of what the future face is going to look like, here's where the

505
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,480
mouth is going to be, here's where the eye is going to be, here are the placodes, I'm

506
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,640
showing you this one because it's the most obvious one to understand, there's other patterns

507
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,720
that we need a lot of decoding but this one's kind of simple, you can see exactly what it's

508
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,640
going to do and this pattern is functional, if I change the electrical properties of this,

509
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,880
if I draw using either optogenetics or other tools to draw on this, I can wipe out this

510
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,760
eye, I can put it somewhere else, I can change the location of the mouth, all of this is

511
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:30,560
actually determinative, this is the set point that guides future cell activity, so that's

512
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:35,120
a natural bioelectrical pattern, this is a pathological one, we'll talk about that momentarily

513
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,760
but this is the one, there's an incipient tumor which we injected a human oncogene and

514
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:46,800
before that tumor appears, you can already see the disruption where these cells are basically,

515
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,360
that oncogene causes them to electrically isolate from their neighbors and basically

516
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,040
at that point they're just amoebas treating the rest of the animal as external environment,

517
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,360
they just disconnect from everything, so we use the same tools that neuroscientists use

518
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,680
to control these electrical states, we can target the ion channels here, we can target

519
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,360
the gap junction, so we can control the topology of the electrical network, we can control

520
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:17,240
the specific states using optogenetics, using drugs, using ion channel mutations, no electric

521
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:23,240
fields, applications, no waves, no magnets, no electromagnetics, this is exactly what

522
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:29,400
neuroscientists do by controlling, by exploiting the actual interface that the system gives

523
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,920
us to manipulate the computations that it does, so how do we know this is of any use,

524
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,280
what happens when you do this, well there's one simple example, what we can do is I showed

525
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,240
you a bioelectrical pattern that tells the animal where to put its eye, so well we can

526
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:48,000
reproduce that pattern somewhere else by injecting ion channel genes, specific let's

527
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,600
say potassium channels somewhere else, and so you can introduce that pattern onto the

528
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,880
gut and that tells the gut cells, hey you need to make an eye here, and if you section

529
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,560
that eye you get all the right lens, right in the optic nerve, you get all that stuff,

530
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,360
now couple of interesting things, one is that the modularity is amazing because what we

531
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:11,040
actually introduce is a very low information content signal, we don't give all the information

532
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,240
that you need to know how to make an eye, what are all the 30 different cell types that

533
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,560
are inside the eye, we don't produce any of that, it's very modular, it's a subroutine

534
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:23,520
call, we say build an eye here and everything else, all the molecular cascades that actually

535
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,600
require to build an eye and make retinal cells and all that, all that's downstream, so that's

536
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,120
the first thing, it's highly modular, the second thing is that it has a really interesting

537
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:40,820
competency, one of them is that in this case what you're looking at, this is a cross section

538
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,660
of a lens, right here, sitting out in the tail somewhere of a tackle, and the blue cells

539
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:51,140
are the ones that we actually injected with our ion channel, so we told these blue cells

540
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,160
you need to make an eye, but there's not enough of them to make an eye, so very much like

541
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,100
ants in an ant colony, what they do is they know how to recruit their neighbors, what

542
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,100
they did is recruit a bunch of these brown cells which themselves were never touched

543
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,780
by us, they're completely normal body cells and they're able to say to these cells, we

544
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,980
need to make a lens here, there's not enough of us to make a lens, you're now going to

545
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,300
participate, and that same thing is studied by people who work on collective insects and

546
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:22,060
so on, this ability to gauge the sort of size of the project you're embarking on and recruit

547
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,940
other members of the swarm to work with you, so these cells certainly have the ability

548
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:32,220
to do that, you can make, using that same modulation we've discovered the code for things

549
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:40,500
like inner ear organs, so otocysts, hearts, so inducing ectopic hearts, extra forebrain,

550
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,660
extra limbs, here are some six-legged frogs here that you can see, and fins, now this

551
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,820
is interesting, tadpoles aren't supposed to have fins, that's more of a fish thing,

552
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:53,100
we'll get to that momentarily, and so one thing that we can do with this now that we're

553
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,900
starting to sort of uncover some of the native subroutines that are there is we can use this

554
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:01,820
in a regenerative medicine setting, so here's a frog, normally if a frog loses a leg here

555
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,020
by 45 days later there's nothing, frogs don't regenerate their legs at this stage on like

556
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,420
salamanders, but what we can do now is we can give it the signal that says hey you need

557
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:16,340
to rebuild this leg, and what happens here is that the way we do that is with a drug

558
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:21,700
that opens specific iron channels at the wound, it turns on the genes that you need to get

559
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:26,220
started on regeneration, by 45 days you've already got some toes, you've got a toenail,

560
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,460
eventually a very nice leg, which is touch sensitive and multile, so it's a very simple

561
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:36,820
approach to, again we're not reprogramming stem cells, we're not 3D printing any tissues,

562
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:41,060
this is that point about the programming I made earlier on, we do not want to interact

563
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:47,140
with the system at the lowest level by telling molecular pathways or cells what to do, we

564
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,100
want to discover the large scale subroutines and the large scale control structure that

565
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:59,220
allows us to say build a leg, so we are at this point in trials in rodents, I have to

566
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:04,460
do a disclosure here because this is Dave Kaplan and I are co-founders of Morphosuticals which

567
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:10,460
seeks to apply this kind of approach to regenerative medicine hopefully someday for humans, so

568
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:16,300
you can see that, that's kind of the applied side of the work, I want to switch to an amazing

569
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,780
example, which really is going to help us understand some more aspects of this, which

570
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:25,860
are that, these are the plenary, you can cut them into as many pieces as you want, I think

571
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:32,180
the record is like 275 or something like that, they're immortal, they have no lifespan limit,

572
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:37,820
they do not age, they're extremely resistant to cancer and they have the world's worst

573
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:44,540
genome, we can talk about what that means later on if we have time, but they have incredible

574
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:52,380
capacity for morphogenetic control, one of the interesting things is that, remember that

575
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:59,460
I promised you at the beginning that we would be able to look for the pattern memory, we

576
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:04,220
would look for that encoding of the set point, that anatomical set point that tells the cells

577
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:09,260
what do we build and when are we complete, so I want to show you a story where we can

578
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,900
rewrite that pattern memory and I've kind of shown you examples already, the thing with

579
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,140
the face and the eye is kind of an example, but I think this is even better, so here's

580
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,580
our plenary, it has one head and one tail, the anterior genes are up here, turned on

581
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:25,860
at the head, turned off at the tail, fine, and if I amputate head and tail, this middle

582
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:31,940
fragment reliably 100% of the time gives us a nice worm, now one of the things that we

583
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,500
did was to discover a bioelectric circuit that actually told the cells, this fragment, well

584
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,380
how many heads are you supposed to have, once the head and the tail are chopped off, which

585
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,740
end is the head or maybe both should be the head, how would you know, so we discovered

586
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:50,820
this electrical circuit and what we were able to do is to convert this perfectly normal

587
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:56,740
one headed animal to a state that once we cut it, it makes a two headed worm, this is

588
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:02,660
not Photoshop, these are real live animals and here's how it works, it's because if you

589
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:08,580
look at this fragment, it has this bio electrical pattern that says one head, one tail and that's

590
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,860
what the cells build, but what we can do is we can take using various ways to modulate

591
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:18,940
ion channels, we can convert this pattern to this pattern, now it's a little messy,

592
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,940
but you can see here the technology is still very much being worked out, but you can see

593
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:27,780
what's happening here, there are two, now the codes is two heads and sure enough, if

594
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:32,740
I now cut this animal, there he is, now here's a very important point that we need to understand,

595
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:38,700
this electrical map is not a map of this two headed creature, this electrical map is

596
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:44,020
a map of this one headed animal in which we have manipulated the electric circuit such

597
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:50,060
that the voltage looks like this, it sits there being one headed until it's injured

598
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,980
and at that point the cells consult this map and build this two headed worm, so the bio

599
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,620
electrical pattern is not a read out of the current anatomy, this is a, you can think

600
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:02,700
about this as a primitive counterfactual memory, this is a memory of something that is not

601
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:07,580
happening right now, in fact may never happen, but if it does, if we get injured, this is

602
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:11,780
what a correct worm is supposed to look like and we will keep rebuilding until this is

603
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:17,940
the pattern we get, so this is an encoded set point, a single headed planarian body can

604
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,980
encode at least one of two different ideas of what a planarian is supposed to look like,

605
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,980
maybe no doubt more, we just said we found it, we found two, so this is very important,

606
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,540
this is the basics of counterfactual memory, this electric circuit can hold at least one

607
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:37,580
of two different representations of what correct planarian should look like and upon injury

608
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,420
the cells don't, this is their reference point, they have nothing else to gauge by, now why

609
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,860
do I keep calling it a memory, because like every good memory, it is not only rewritable

610
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:52,020
but it's long term stable, so if I take these two headed worms and now I amputate the head

611
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:57,060
and I amputate this other topic head and I leave just the nice normal mid fragment, no

612
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:01,300
more treatments of any kind, plain water, the genetics haven't been changed, we never

613
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,620
edited the genome, there's nothing wrong with the genetics of this animal, so you might think

614
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,580
that okay well once you've cut this off, now you'll go back to normal, and that's not what

615
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:15,900
happens, so these animals forever in perpetuity now generate two headed worms, so where is

616
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,580
the fact, where is it stored that they're now two headed worms, it is stored in the

617
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:25,140
electrical pattern distributed over the cells, that pattern has a memory property, once you've

618
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:29,380
changed it, it holds and in fact now we know how to change it back, so we can take that

619
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,620
pattern, change it back to a one headed and then you get a line of one headed animals,

620
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:41,660
so the answer to how, what determines how many heads Plinaria have is not really nailed

621
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,980
down by the genetics, what the genetics does is it gives you an electric circuit that by

622
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:52,060
default says one head, but that circuit is reprogrammable, you can change it to say two

623
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:57,420
heads and it will hold state as far as we can tell forever, and then you can sort of

624
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,820
flip it back and forth, so you can think of this as a distributed flip flop, and here

625
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:10,980
are these two headed Plinaria in their native habitat, so what we're doing now, so there's

626
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,500
a lot of computational work that needs to happen, one thing is that we're trying to map

627
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:20,380
out the bioelectric state space of that circuit to understand why certain parts of it correspond

628
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:25,460
to one head, two head and so on, and view that kind of regeneration as a kind of energy

629
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,900
minimization process, where basically what you're doing, and this will be familiar to

630
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:34,180
all of you who study this kind of stuff, to recover these pattern memories when they are

631
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:43,780
damaged, and so we really want to see if some of the tools of connectionist kinds of computer

632
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,540
science can help us understand what's going on here, the link between the physics of the

633
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:52,660
circuit and the information processing of memory, of recall, of energy minimization and so on.

634
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:57,220
Now, I want to show you how far we can go with this, so here I've shown you one head,

635
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:01,740
two head, I mean that's pretty cool, but these are normal heads that belong to these animals

636
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:06,060
anyway, but one thing you can do is you can push them into further attractors in that state

637
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:11,300
space that belong to other species, so I can take this triangular shaped worm with no genetic

638
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:17,100
change whatsoever, with completely normal hardware I can cause, just by disrupting that

639
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,940
electrical decision making when you cut off the head, they have to decide what the head

640
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,900
shape is, I can make flat heads like the Pifelina, we can make round heads like an S-Mediterranean,

641
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:31,180
or of course we can make the normal ones. The shape of the brain becomes just like these other

642
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:37,420
species, the distribution of stem cells in the brain becomes just like these other species,

643
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:44,140
they can access, a genetically normal set of cells can access other morphological attractors

644
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,780
if you push them that way along this bioelectrical interface.

645
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,820
You can even push them further and you can make, you can reach shapes that don't belong to

646
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:58,380
plenary at all, so you can make these kind of hybrid forms, you can make radially symmetrical,

647
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:03,900
you know sort of ski cap looking things, you can make these weird spiky forms, there's a tremendous

648
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:10,620
variety of anatomical forms that you can achieve if you interfere with the ability of these cells

649
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:15,580
to navigate morpho space, what they want to do is to reach this region of the morpho space,

650
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,420
and they're very good at it, but now that we found this electrical process by which they

651
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:27,420
navigate, we can push them into other areas. So what we're doing now is we're building some,

652
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:33,900
so we have a very biorealistic computational simulator of electrical activity, so we can

653
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:39,660
sort of look at the circuits at the tissue level, how do they rescale and all of that,

654
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:46,300
and then we're trying, the goal, long-term goal, is this kind of full stack model where we start

655
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:51,340
with the facts of which ion channels are expressed, so that's where the genetics plays out, and that's

656
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:56,140
your hardware, but then at the tissue level, what are all the voltage dynamics? They're really not

657
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:01,020
obvious because all of these channels, a lot of them are voltage gated, that's a voltage gated

658
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,940
current conductance, that's a transistor, so when you put these things into circuits,

659
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:11,100
all kinds of symmetry breaking loops, they have all, they can do memory as I just shown you,

660
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:16,220
they have all kinds of interesting computations, but very nonlinear, hard to predict, and so then

661
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:22,300
we want to understand this decision making of head versus tail versus what else, and to the point

662
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,140
where we get to an algorithmic model, so we're using some machine learning approaches to try and

663
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:31,740
extract actually kind of white box algorithmic models, so that then at this point we can say,

664
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:37,660
okay, but what would we need to do if we wanted a fatter worm or three heads or, you know,

665
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:41,980
somebody needed a new finger or a new eye or something like that? Okay, so for the last bit,

666
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:46,140
I'm just gonna finish up with a couple of things. I want to talk about very quickly

667
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:54,300
this idea of, because what I've shown you is the collective intelligence of individual cells

668
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:59,100
solving a very large-scale problem, they solve a problem that the individual cells don't have,

669
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:04,940
so I want to talk about this idea of scaling. This is what evolution does. Evolution takes

670
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:13,180
this kind of creature and enables them to connect with each other to solve problems

671
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:17,420
at the level of anatomical morphospace, so for example, if we don't have enough fingers,

672
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,500
we will know that the tissue knows that and can regenerate the right number of fingers,

673
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,340
then it stops. Individual cells have no idea what a finger is or how many fingers there are

674
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:29,900
or anything like that, but the collective does, and so what evolution does is this amazing scaling

675
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:35,340
up, but that process has a failure mode. That failure mode is known as cancer, so what happens in

676
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:42,220
cancer is that when individual cells disconnect from this electrical network, they go back to being

677
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:48,060
a single cell amoebas where their goals are now maximal proliferation and maximal metabolic gain

678
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:53,100
instead of having goals in anatomical morphospace, so this is human glioblastoma, these are cells,

679
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:59,900
crawling around in culture with no inclination to work hard towards these kinds of things.

680
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:06,300
So what happens is that the magic here is in these electrical connections, these gap junctions

681
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:11,820
that allow cells to share information very tightly, and in particular, their synapses,

682
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:16,780
they're called synapses because they are open and closed by prior experiences, meaning that

683
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:21,980
the information that moves through a particular synapse also feeds back because of their voltage

684
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,780
sensitivity to open and close that synapse, so you have this kind of activity-dependent memory,

685
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:33,580
and so that allows a tissue to have much larger cognitive light cones in terms of how much do

686
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:38,620
they remember, how much can they anticipate, how much can they measure than individual cells,

687
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:44,620
that's the scale-up, and so another biomedical application that we're working on is to force

688
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:50,220
that connection, so here is this, we inject an oncogene, so normally it would make a tumor,

689
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,140
here it is, the oncogene is blazingly expressed, in fact it's all over the place here,

690
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,860
but there is no tumor because what we've done is we've co-injected a very specific ion channel

691
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:03,020
that forces that cell to remain an electrical connection with their neighbors, so when you

692
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:06,700
force them, even if the genetics are screwed up, so I've shown you a number of examples where

693
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:12,940
the genetics is diverting from the actual outcome, what the hardware says is one thing,

694
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,700
but you can make changes, and we have lots of other examples of fixing birth defects and other

695
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:22,620
things in software by temporary electrical states that push the system in a way that

696
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:29,100
it normally wouldn't have done, and so this is a tumor normalization technology that we're also

697
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:34,300
trying to move to a medical outcome, so what we're trying, the big mystery here, what we're

698
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:42,300
trying to do now is to make computational models of local homeostatic loops that started out in

699
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:49,180
bacteria by managing pH and metabolics and things like that, and show how by connecting these, so

700
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,700
basically what you have is a network of homeostats, so you have a network of these things that are

701
00:49:52,700 --> 00:50:04,700
able to control local variables towards set points, and by connecting them you are enabling the

702
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:09,900
collective to now do the same thing, but in a much much different space, and so this is the

703
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,780
kind of big area where we need to understand lots more, and so these are the kind of models

704
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:19,020
that we're thinking about. Okay, so for the last kind of couple of minutes, I want to talk about

705
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:27,020
this idea of novel organisms, so we wanted, oh, and I have to do another disclosure, this is we

706
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:33,020
also have a spin-off company for biorebotics called Fauna Systems, and this is all the work

707
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:37,740
with Josh Baumgart at University of Vermont, with whom we've started this thing, the Institute for

708
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:43,900
Computationally Designed Organisms. We wanted to ask a simple question, how far does this plasticity

709
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:49,660
go? I've shown you that normal embryos are able to adapt to changes of cell number, cell shape,

710
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:57,740
amount of DNA, but also you can push them to make, you can make worms with the heads that belong to

711
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:03,740
other species and worm bodies that are just not normal plenaria worms, so how far does that plasticity

712
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:10,140
go? And in particular, if you take cells away from their normal context, can they reboot their

713
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:15,180
multicellularity? What will they do? And so we did this experiment, I'm going to pause this right

714
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:21,100
here, so this is a frog embryo in cross-section, if you take off this top part here, these all of

715
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:25,580
these cells up here are going to be skin, they're all faded to be different kinds of epidermis,

716
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:30,460
and so we asked this question, if I take these cells, I disassociate them,

717
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:37,180
I put a little drop of them in a separate environment away from all of this stuff, so

718
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:44,380
I'm not, we're not adding any kind of, and by the way the person who physically does this is

719
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:48,940
Doug Blackiston in our group, he's a staff scientist who perfected a lot of these protocols,

720
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,900
we're not adding synthetic biology constructs, we're not changing the DNA, we're not putting

721
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,700
any weird nano materials, we're engineering by subtraction, we're taking away the instructive

722
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,580
signals from all of this stuff, and so what would they do? Well, they might die, they might spread

723
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:07,500
out and sort of crawl away from each other, they might form a two-dimensional monolayer like cell

724
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:12,620
culture, we don't know, but those are some things they might do, instead what they do is, so here

725
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:17,740
these are loose cells, this is time-lapse, so overnight they sort of come together and they

726
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:22,380
merge into this little thing, this little round thing, the flashes or calcium flashes, we'll talk

727
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:27,980
about that momentarily, what does it do? So this is a little ball of skin, what does a little ball

728
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:33,260
of skin do? Well the first thing it does is, it takes little hairs that are normally used on the

729
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:39,020
skin to move the mucus down the body of the animal, and it uses those hairs to swim, it rose

730
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:46,300
through the media by pushing the little hairs in opposite directions to the left and right of a

731
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:52,860
midline that it can organize, here you can see some behaviors, so they can go in circles, they can

732
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:59,180
sort of patrol back and forth, they can hear some tracking data on group behavior, so this guy's going

733
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:05,740
on kind of a long journey, these are interacting with each other, then sometimes they sit still

734
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:10,300
for long periods of time, they have autonomous motion, this is what they look like in a maze,

735
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:14,620
so this is a water maze, there's no flow, there are no gradients, it's just still spring water,

736
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:19,420
it goes down here, it takes the corner without having to bump into the outside wall, so it doesn't

737
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:24,540
have to bump into anything, it just follows the corner, and then around this at this point, let's

738
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:28,060
play it again, so remember this is just skin, there are no brain, there's no brain, there's no nervous

739
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:33,660
system, so it takes this corner, and at this point for some reason that we don't know, internal

740
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:37,420
behaviors, it turns around and goes back where it came from, doesn't want to keep going anymore,

741
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:42,540
so they have a range of behaviors, if you ask what does the calcium signaling look like, again no

742
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:49,180
neurons here, but the skin is actually very active with very brain-like dynamics, which we are now

743
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:53,100
analyzing using information theory and things like that, to see what's going on and whether they

744
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,340
might be talking to each other, they have regenerative capacity, so if I cut it in half,

745
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:03,020
they will try to fold up to their new xenobot shape, with the amazing force to the 180-degree hinge

746
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:08,620
that they have to deploy to fold themselves up, and the most amazing thing that they do is this,

747
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:17,180
this is, so Josh and his student Sam Creedman did computational simulations of these guys in a

748
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:21,820
virtual world with different shapes that we, you know, that Doug was able to actually make,

749
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:26,940
and we saw something very interesting that in the computational kind of simulation,

750
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:34,140
one of the things they do is they rearrange the particles in their environment

751
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:39,340
into specific shapes, that was a prediction of the simulation, so we tried, we gave them some

752
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:43,580
particles, what did we give them, we gave them cells, loose cells, this is the white stuff,

753
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:47,980
the snow here, that those are loose cells, and what you see is that the xenobots run around,

754
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:58,220
they corral these particles into little piles, and then they sort of continue to polish those

755
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:02,780
little piles until they become kind of these circular things, and then because what we did

756
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:08,060
was we gave them skin cells, these little piles became the next generation of xenobots, and so

757
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:12,700
guess what, when they matured, they went and did the same thing, and they created the next generation

758
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:19,100
of xenobots, so this is Von Neumann's dream, this is a machine that runs around and makes copies

759
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:24,300
of itself from particles that it, or the parts that it finds in its environment, the only reason

760
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:29,100
this trick works, of course, is because like evolution, and like us, it's working within a

761
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:35,020
gentle material, it's working with cells that are not passive pebbles, but are actually materials

762
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:40,300
that when you collect them into a little pile, they already have the competency of becoming

763
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:46,620
a xenobot, so it actually takes very little to get this reproductive cycle happening,

764
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:51,420
so the last couple of things I just want to say is this, we can learn some interesting things from

765
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:57,820
this, this is the standard Xenopus lavas genome, the standard frog, if you only observe standard

766
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:03,180
development, you are really lulled into a false sense of security, you're given the idea that,

767
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:09,420
well, acorns always make oak trees, frog eggs always make frogs, the genome determines morphology,

768
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:14,300
this is what they can make, they make an embryo that has a certain set of developmental sequences

769
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:21,820
and then a certain behaviors, that's what this hardware makes. Actually, if you liberate these

770
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:25,740
skin cells, so what do skin cells know how to do? Well, of course, they know how to be a boring

771
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:31,340
two-dimensional outer layer on this animal, keep out the bacteria, that's it, well, that's what

772
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:36,620
they do when the other cells sort of bully them into that role, the instructive interactions

773
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:41,580
from the other cells are what's constraining the capacity of these skin cells to sit quietly as

774
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:47,740
the outer layer and that's that. On their own, given the ability to escape these instructive

775
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:51,820
interactions, they're actually capable of much more, they make a xenobite, they undergo a

776
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,260
developmental sequence over the next two months, they become this thing, I don't know what the

777
00:56:55,260 --> 00:57:03,740
heck this is, they have their own kind of weird developmental trajectory and their behaviors

778
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:09,740
are things like making copies of themselves via kinematic self-replication. Now, this is interesting

779
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:15,340
because for every other creature on earth, if you were to ask why does it have a certain shape,

780
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:20,140
a certain behavior, how does it be able to do whatever it is that it does, the answer is always

781
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:24,540
the same, well, years of selection, right, eons of evolutionary pressure to do this or that,

782
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:28,780
there's never been any xenobots, there's never been any evolutionary pressure to be a good

783
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:35,180
xenobot, to do kinematic self-replication to any of the behaviors that they do and the morphology,

784
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:39,340
there's never been any pressure for that. So, where does this come from, right, this plasticity,

785
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:45,820
this amazing fact that evolution gave us this genome that very reliably does this, but it also

786
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:49,740
can do this and who knows what else, right, I think we're just scratching the surface. So,

787
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:55,100
I'm going to end here and just say that the main points, I think, that are emerging from all our

788
00:57:55,100 --> 00:58:00,940
work, including many things I didn't show you, is this. Evolution tends to build generic problem

789
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:07,580
solving machines, which because of this kind of compression of complex bodies into a single cell

790
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:14,540
during sexual reproduction, really enables some amazing hardware that exploits aspects of physics

791
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:20,060
and computation that doesn't try to pre-code everything. And development shows us that these

792
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:26,220
kind of agents in morphospace and in other spaces really have to deal with whatever they're given

793
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:33,580
at the beginning. They are not, in the large part, they are not tied to a very specific, very tight

794
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:39,660
set of initial conditions. And we can also talk about, there's this intelligence ratchet that's

795
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:45,820
formed because that competency actually hides a lot of genomic fitness information from evolution.

796
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:50,060
So, a lot of the effort goes into that competency, actually, as opposed to the hardware.

797
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:56,780
And the physiology, especially the bioelectrics, can navigate various problem spaces with all

798
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:01,580
kinds of competencies, all kinds of interesting competencies. And then, synthetic bioengineering

799
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:10,380
tells us that life, because of all of this, life is extremely interoperable. We can make any kind of

800
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:19,180
combination of hardware, software. This is one of my favorite kind of videos. This is an early

801
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:23,020
baby mantle, discovering for the first time what kinds of effectors it has. Look at this,

802
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:28,220
I've got legs, I've got arms, amazing. So, one of the, they don't know. You see, you don't know

803
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:33,580
ahead of time when embryos are born into this world, much like Josh Bongard's robots.

804
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:39,900
They don't know right away what they have, where their boundaries with the outside world is.

805
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:44,300
All of that has to be computationally defined spontaneously. So, if we're thinking about

806
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:51,020
how intelligence has come into this world, here's what the biology is telling us.

807
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:55,660
Multiscale competencies, lots of levels, as Daniel was talking about at the very beginning,

808
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:01,020
competing and cooperating with each other. Spontaneous emergence of boundaries, energy

809
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:07,020
constraints, which require you to do core, coarse graining on your inputs. Self-modeling,

810
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,580
all of this kind of stuff is what biology is telling us. And because of this interoperability,

811
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:17,820
everything that we know in the natural world, all of the Darwin's endless forms, most beautiful,

812
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:23,580
are just the tiny corner of this option space. Every combination of evolved material,

813
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:30,300
designed machinery, and software is some kind of agent. And a lot of this already exists.

814
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:36,620
So, hybrid, cyborgs, all kinds of things where the future is going to look like this. And that

815
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:41,900
really means that we have to redefine a lot of our old categories that started out by looking at

816
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:46,620
this picture of the Garden of Eden, where you have a standard human, you have some standard animals,

817
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:51,900
and that's it. And you can draw a simple line and you know what's going on. That picture is gone.

818
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,980
So, I'm just going to close here. There are some papers that if anybody's interested in

819
01:00:55,980 --> 01:01:00,860
diving further into these issues, here's some papers I could send you. I want to thank all

820
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:06,540
the people that did the work. So, Doug and Sam did all the Xenobot work. Here are the other

821
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:11,260
students and postdocs that contributed to this stuff, our collaborators, our funders,

822
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:15,740
most of all, our model systems, the animals do most of the heavy lifting here.

823
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:19,580
And that's it. Thank you for listening and I will take any questions.

824
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:23,100
Oh, thank you for a truly marvelous talk.

825
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:24,460
Thank you.

826
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:32,620
So, yes. And yeah, so we have a few minutes for questions. I think you said we have about

827
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:42,380
10 minutes left. So, yeah, okay. Yes, Daniel, I think you were first.

828
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:47,980
Hey, if I start asking, nobody else will have time. So, I'll leave the others and

829
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,780
leave my mind for the last.

830
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,180
Okay, Christoph, I thought I saw your hand.

831
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:57,580
Oh, sorry, I was just clapping.

832
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:06,540
Oh, okay, okay. Well, anyone else before I start asking questions as well.

833
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:18,060
So, okay, in that case, I have too many questions and I don't know enough about it.

834
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:24,380
And I'd really like to know more about these bioelectrical patterns and how you, I don't know,

835
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:31,900
for instance, seem to have gained control over how to manipulate those, say for, you know,

836
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:37,660
you fix the genetics and you give it the somehow the phenotype of a different creature,

837
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:43,980
a different animal entirely. That is absolutely mind blowing, I have to say. And how,

838
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:49,660
I mean, it almost seems like, you know, you could make the phenotype of,

839
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:57,020
it almost seems like the genetics isn't as important as we, as we thought it, I mean,

840
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:03,420
yeah, as we thought it would be. I mean, it's just, yeah, to how, to what extent can you get

841
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:09,180
something with a sort of drastically, how drastically different can the phenotype end up?

842
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:16,620
I think, I think that, well, look, in the, in the plan area, it's 150 million years difference

843
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:21,420
between the animals that we start with and the ones that we can make. And it's equivalent to

844
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:26,860
150 million years of evolutionary distance to these other species. Plus, of course, we can make

845
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:30,780
shapes that never existed, that never existed. So, you know, I don't know what the distance

846
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:36,460
there would be. But I think it's a very important point. I think absolutely the role of the genome

847
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:42,700
is not what we thought it was. You know, one of the, one of the key things here is though,

848
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:45,420
is that I think, and a lot of people get very suspicious about, you know,

849
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:49,260
sort of computer science analogies, but I think, I think the part that is actually very,

850
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:55,100
very useful is the distinction between hardware and software. So I think that tells us what,

851
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:59,660
you know, the genome, this, this, there's the, you know, some of our students are taught this,

852
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:04,380
this that, well, you know, the cell is the, is the hardware that interprets the genome and the

853
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,300
genome is the software of this. I think that's, that's completely wrong. I think what, what the

854
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:12,460
genome actually does is nail down the hardware of the cell. The genome tells you what channels

855
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:16,620
you're going to have. If your genome does not give you a voltage-gated ion channel,

856
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:20,620
there's very limited, you don't have those transistors, there's very limited things you can

857
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:26,540
do. So the hardware is critical because it, it, it, it facilitates or forbids certain kinds of

858
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:31,980
behavior modes. But we all know now that knowing the hardware does not tell you all of the

859
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:35,260
interesting things you need to know about what this thing is going to be able to do.

860
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:40,220
Not only does it, that is, that can the same hardware run many different kinds of, of, of

861
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:46,540
behavior modes, but also it means that the way you interact with it does not have to be at the

862
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:51,420
hardware level, right? That, that's kind of the huge, the huge insight to me of, of, of, of, of

863
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:55,580
computer science is this idea of reprogrammability. There, there are certain, that once you get beyond

864
01:04:55,580 --> 01:05:01,580
a certain capacity, and I think biological systems are way beyond that, you can, you can interact

865
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:07,020
with it via inputs, via stimuli, via communication, via, you know, who knows how high that goes,

866
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:13,980
not just by rewiring it. And so I think that all of this, you know, the focus on, on the DNA,

867
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:19,020
both as the source of the information and as the optimal control knob, right, all the excitement

868
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:23,260
over genomic editing and everything else, those things I think are, are misplaced. But that's

869
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:26,380
not to say that the genome isn't important. I mean, you need to have the right hardware. If you

870
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:29,420
don't have the right hardware, it's not, you're not, you're not going to be able to do certain

871
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:34,300
things. So it's like there's a whole area of interaction with physics, what this hardware

872
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:40,220
can do that, you know, there is some physics that it exploits, and that doesn't need to be in the

873
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:48,060
genome. And yeah, it's, yeah. Yeah, that's, that's a very profound, that's a very profound idea,

874
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:53,580
which is that, and people have been thinking about this actually in, in, in mathematics for the longest

875
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:58,460
time. So, so where do the truths of number theory live, right, where, where, you know, you could

876
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:02,780
change all the facts of, of the initial conditions of the universe, and the number theory would

877
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:07,980
still be what it is, right? And so, so think about this, right? If you were to try to evolve a

878
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:12,620
triangle, so you evolve the first angle, you evolve the second angle, but guess what, you don't

879
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:16,540
need to evolve the third angle, you know what it is, right? Where does that come from, that, that,

880
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:22,860
you know, that's an amazing kind of free lunch, you know, as the physicists would say, right?

881
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:26,940
And, and the same thing with computation. So once you evolve that ion channel,

882
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:30,700
that's basically a transistor. So now you get to have logic gates and truth tables.

883
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:35,020
Did you have to evolve a truth table? No, you got that for free. Where do truth tables live?

884
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,780
You know, I don't know, but that's kind of beyond my pay grade. But, but, but, but, but I think

885
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:44,540
you're absolutely right is that what evolution does is it builds machines that couple to these

886
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:50,860
amazing affordances, right? So, so, so, so when, you know, in the behavioral ecology, they would

887
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:56,940
call these affordances, these incredible affordances provided by physics, by computation, by geometry,

888
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:01,900
by mechanics, you know, who knows what else is out there. Yeah, I think, I think that's,

889
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:07,260
that's, that's really an important way to look at evolution. Oh, that's, yeah. Daniel, yes.

890
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:15,100
I can't hold myself any longer. But first of all, this is an amazing talk. I wish we could

891
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:19,740
now sit together and talk for the rest of the afternoon, which neither you nor I can do. But

892
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:27,660
that we should definitely continue talking. And one thing that I, I find we, I could, first

893
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:33,660
of all, completely agree with this point about the triangle. So I just recently said to somebody

894
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:39,100
that mathematics is neither discovered, nor constructed, but it's something in between.

895
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:45,260
Right. And basically, you construct some things and then there are constraints that emerge and

896
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:50,700
they are implicit to whatever you do. It's a bit like what I call a box of oranges,

897
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:54,940
you fill the box of oranges and you get these hexagonal patterns once you're dense enough.

898
01:07:54,940 --> 01:08:01,660
And this is not something you created. It's a aspect of the space that forces this upon us.

899
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:06,380
But we still have choices between different crystal patterns, for example, in the dimensions,

900
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:11,980
for example, there are 14 crystal patterns. What I was wondering, I mean, to me, it looks like

901
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:18,700
there's an element of holography in the whole thing. So where information is not fully localized.

902
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:24,060
And I felt that's the most strong reaction in your example with the brain, with double,

903
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:34,300
reconstructed brain. Because the question is how much information can you retain holographically?

904
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:39,820
So when you take this plan on one, and I think there wasn't even the experiment where even mice,

905
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:45,980
I think mice got. The question is, well, how much information can you retain when my language,

906
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:51,500
I would say, how many bits can you retain in this delocalized form?

907
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:59,180
Yeah, that's a great point. I have no idea how much information. We can't do the bits thing

908
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:03,340
because we don't know what the encoding and decoding of the message is. So that's hard.

909
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:08,540
But you're absolutely right. There's holography here in two ways. One is the sort of lateral way,

910
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:13,340
which is that, yeah, most of this information is distributed spatially across the whole animal.

911
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:19,020
So the bioelectric code and what enables us to do these various things is not a single cell

912
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:24,220
code. This is not something that tells individual cells what cell type they should be. This is

913
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:30,140
spread across the whole tissue. And of course, you can cut it both spatially and behaviorally.

914
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:36,540
It rescales the information onto every piece retains it. So that's kind of lateral holography.

915
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:40,860
There's also a vertical one, which is interesting in a very important sense.

916
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:46,860
A lot of the same rules that operate in controlling the morphology of large scale

917
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:57,500
bodies, like ours, some of those same rules are playing out in the shaping of single cells.

918
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:04,380
So there are weird kind of mathematical aspects of morphology that work the same way

919
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:11,420
in multicellular bodies, but also in single cells that are completely low at a much lower scale.

920
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:14,940
And other people have found the same thing in patterning of ant colonies and so on.

921
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:23,100
So there's also this kind of almost a fractal kind of idea that the same things repeat themselves

922
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:26,700
again and again at different scales, despite the fact that the material implementation is quite

923
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:34,620
different at that point. That's really very interesting because I do think that there might

924
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:44,460
be ways of actually quantifying that. And I very much like this attractor vision of genetic coding,

925
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:49,020
because we know that embodiment can change a lot. I mean, the talk that I give with you,

926
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:54,140
I think I mentioned that very, very primitive example of how you can totally change the amount

927
01:10:54,220 --> 01:11:01,820
of information you need to do something if you change embodiment. So it's really drastically

928
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:08,140
different than the big question is how much can you associate to the embodiment? How much can

929
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:14,300
you associate to, in your case, the genome? I see the Stavros question. So I just go silent.

930
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:17,500
We can discuss another time. So let Stavros go ahead. Sorry.

931
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:27,820
Stavros? Yeah, I'll take the question with I apologize in about three minutes. I do have to run.

932
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:37,180
Yeah, sorry. Sorry to interrupt you, Daniel. Thanks for your talk. I'll be very quick. I've seen you

933
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:41,420
in other talks sort of talk about using the language of affect to kind of describe like,

934
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:47,340
you know, navigating this morphological spaces and kind of extending the concept of affect.

935
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:55,500
Beyond what it's usually used to describe these morphological spaces. Can you talk more on that?

936
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:04,060
Yeah, I think that's a very long discussion. But the short version of it is that we have been

937
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:11,740
trying to map as many concepts in cognitive neuroscience as we can onto this, for example,

938
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:19,180
navigating morphospace. So all kinds of issues that people normally attribute to. So, you know,

939
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:26,620
goal seeking behavior, rewards, punishments, different different types of learning and memory,

940
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:32,780
different types of so affect all these kinds of things, perceptual by stability, visual illusions,

941
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:37,500
all of these things can be mapped very, very nicely. And in fact, I have I have tables in

942
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,860
a couple of papers, which I'm happy to send, where it just goes side by side. And it shows

943
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:46,140
you exactly what the what the mapping is. And so there are mappings for, for affect and for many,

944
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:49,020
you know, for many, many of these terms. And I'm not saying all of them are going to map,

945
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:53,820
but so far, it's the symmetry has worked, you know, kind of very nicely. So you can define

946
01:12:53,820 --> 01:13:02,220
these things in other spaces. So incredible. Thank you. Thank you so much. Drop me an email,

947
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:08,940
and I'll send you I'll send you the paper where we go into this. Okay. So are there any more

948
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:13,340
questions? I don't know if there's actually time for any more questions, but it's I wish there were,

949
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:20,380
but it's, yeah. So take this opportunity once more to thank the speaker for a wonderful talk.

950
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:24,940
Thank you so much. Really appreciate the discussion. And please by all means email me,

951
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:30,380
I'd love to I'd love to discuss with anybody anytime. Yeah. Thank you again. Okay. Thank you so

952
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:42,940
much, everybody. Thank you. All right. Bye.
