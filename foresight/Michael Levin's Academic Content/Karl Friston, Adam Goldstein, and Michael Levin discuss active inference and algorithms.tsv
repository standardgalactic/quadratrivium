0	9520	Great. So what I was hoping, Carla, is that we could get your thoughts on how the whole
9520	15800	Active Inference Framework could be applied to something that we've been developing. And
15800	18680	I don't know if you had a chance to look at any of this stuff, but I'll just give you
18680	24160	a brief, you know, kind of a brief summary so that it's clear what we've got. And then
24160	28680	I have some basic questions and then a couple of wacky ideas to kind of bounce off of you
28680	35040	and see what you think. So the basic thing is this, that what I was trying to do is to
35040	47200	have a very basal model of distributed intelligence. And the idea was that we were interested in
47200	52240	unexpected competencies in places where unlike in biology, you know, in biology, no matter
52240	56040	how simple your model, you never have all the information about mechanisms and somebody
56040	59560	can always say, well, there is a mechanism for that, you just haven't found it yet, right?
59560	65880	So we wanted something that was incredibly simple, incredibly transparent, deterministic,
65880	69480	something that everybody thinks they know what it does. And then we can, we can apply
69480	73600	some of the approaches that we take in my lab about taking something that doesn't seem
73600	78320	cognitive and saying, okay, but what, what actual competencies might it have, right?
78320	82520	And so we chose this thing called sorting algorithms. And so these are the same simple
82520	85720	algorithms that all computer science students study for, you know, and they've been studied
85720	92440	for decades. And then we made a couple of, a couple of twists to it. One is that we visualize
92440	98560	their progress from being a jumbled set of digits to an ordered set of digits as a kind
98560	102240	of a traversal of space, right? So the idea is they start in different locations and they
102240	107800	all sooner or later, they all end up in one location where everything is. And so once,
107800	111320	once you view it as navigating that space, then you can ask some questions about what
111360	115520	are their competencies and navigating that space under, under odd perturbations. One
115520	122400	of the perturbations that we made was the introduction of what we call broken cells or
122400	126960	barriers in the space. So if the algorithm wants to swap two numbers in order to proceed
126960	130680	in its, in its sorting trajectory, well, one of the numbers could be broken, it doesn't
130680	134640	move, you can't, you can't move. And so, and we have two kinds of broken numbers, ones
134640	140840	that never initiate swaps and ones that actually never, never swapped no matter, you know,
140880	147120	who initiates them. And so that allows us to ask questions about things like delayed
147120	151640	gratification. In other words, can it go further from it? If it encounters a barrier,
151640	156200	can it go further away from its goal in order to then acquire gains afterwards? And this
156200	160560	is, you know, William James talked about this, of course, as, as an important type of basal
160560	164680	intelligence. And, and that, and that breaks a common assumption with these algorithms,
164680	169760	which is typically you assume that the material is, is robust. In other words, when you, when
169760	175440	an algorithm says to do something, it gets done. But, but in our case, not necessarily. And
175440	180080	we never introduced, this is important, we never introduced any extra code to check if
180080	184400	things got done. It's, it's the standard algorithm. So it just keeps on rolling. There is no
184400	189240	code to see how am I doing? Did things work out? No, no code for any of that. The second
189240	195200	thing we did was to break the, the, the general version of this is centralized. So there's
195200	198840	like this omniscient controller, and it's following one of several algorithms to kind
198880	203800	of move numbers around. And we got rid of that and instead made it all bottom up. So every
203800	210000	digit, aka every cell now has its own version of the algorithm running, and it has a limited
210000	214520	local view of who its neighbors are. And it's just following the steps of the algorithm to
214520	219240	try to improve its local environment, that there is no more global, global control. So
219240	225280	it's distributed. And, and, and, you know, we learned a few things. We learned that a, the
225280	229840	distributed version of this works quite well. It actually, you know, they do sort nicely. So,
229840	234040	so that's great. We did see some delayed gratification in the sense that if you, if you
234040	239440	sprinkle in some broken cells, it actually will go backwards and unsort the string a little bit,
239440	245320	and it's effort to then go around the defect as it were. So that's kind of cool. But the most
245360	252760	kind of surprising thing, which is what I'd love to get your take on is this. We, because now
252800	257440	it's distributed and every cell is following its own algorithm, that enables us to do an
257440	261640	experiment that otherwise you couldn't do, which is to make a chimeric string. And it's what we do
261640	265800	in developmental biology, when we put together, you know, axolotl cells and frog cells, and now
265800	269280	you get this frog a lot, and you can ask questions like, well, what shape is it going to have,
269280	274600	right? So, so what you can make is a chimeric string where some of the numbers are following one
274600	279240	algorithm, some of them are following a different algorithm. And again, there is this is important,
279240	285440	there is no code to determine either your own or your neighbor's algotype. And algotype is the
285440	289480	word that Adam coined for this, like, you know, what algorithm, what set of properties are you
289480	293160	actually following a policy? Is it actually following? So there is no code for any of that,
293160	300240	but we know which, which algotype all the cells. So that, and that also works. So chimeric strings
300240	305400	also sort, sort the, sort the arrays, and that's fine. What we then did was we asked basically a
305400	309600	developmental biology question was to say, okay, at any particular point during its journey,
309600	315680	what is the distribution of algotypes within the string? And what we know, and we defined
315680	322600	a quantity called clustering, which basically just means you look, you look next to you and what,
322600	328720	what's the probability that your neighbor next to you is the same algotype as you are. So what
328720	333320	happens is that in the very beginning, that probability is 50% because the algotypes are
333320	339760	randomly assigned to the digits. So 50%. That's our baseline. At the very end, it's also 50%
339760	344560	because at the end, everybody has to be sorted. And there is no relationship between the actual
344560	349880	sort order of the numbers and the algotype. So again, it's 50%. But the wild thing is that in
349880	354440	between those two points, if you actually plot that curve over time, it actually goes like this.
354440	359800	And in between, it's quite a bit higher in statistically very significantly higher than 50%.
360360	367400	And what we see is clustering significant tendency of cells with the same algotype to locate close
367400	372120	together. Eventually, the inevitable, the inevitable physics of the algorithm will yank
372120	376920	them apart and make sure that everybody's in numerical order. But until that happens, they
376920	382200	enjoy some amount of clustering with their, you know, with their conspecific, so to speak, until
382200	388040	then. And so, you know, any thoughts you might have, but more specifically, like one hypothesis
388040	392280	the one could make, even though there's no explicit mechanism for this, but it might be a,
392280	396520	you know, an emergent thing, could they be preferring to be next to their neighbors because
396520	402440	their neighbors be one of the same algotype or more predictable, right? It's less surprise,
402440	405480	you're less surprised when you're sitting next to somebody who's following exactly the same
405480	412040	policies as you are. So I'm curious what you think about that. And I'm curious if there, you know,
412120	418280	what might be a set of experiments that we could do to test that what's going on here is some sort
418280	423240	of implicit surprise minimization, even though there's no actual code for it. So I'll stop there
423240	430200	and listen to what you've got to say. Sorry, I think you're still muted.
434600	439880	I was saying that was a very succinct and clear, a nice summary. I reread the paper a couple of
439880	447240	days ago just to refresh myself, my memory for this conversation. So I didn't realize that that was
447240	454760	the, that final chimeric demonstration was sort of, you know, the most intriguing from your point of
454760	463880	view. But indeed, the way you express it, you know, that does call for further analysis, understanding
463880	476520	and numerical experiments. So overall, just to endorse the choice of the sorting algorithm as,
476520	485880	if you like, a minimal kind of self-organization. I think that, you know, that the self-organization
485880	492680	word needs to be centre stage in terms of, you know, what you're trying to understand here.
493960	499640	And framing like that, it does remind me a lot of self-organizing maps. I don't know if you remember
499640	506440	van der Molzberg's treatment and people, Peter Dion's supervisor, I've forgotten now.
508840	515240	So this notion of self-organizing maps as a very sort of biomimetic aspect of self-organization,
515240	523560	I think certainly puts sorting like algorithms centre stage in terms of biological self-organization,
523560	530920	particularly in things like the visual cortex and why you get that kind of pinwheel architecture,
530920	538040	for example, where receptive field properties tend to cluster together in a smooth way and you get
538040	544120	all sorts of interesting symmetry breaking when you're trying to represent, say, a 5D perceptual
544120	550840	space on a 2D manifold. So that does strike me having this sort of linear sorting algorithm.
551160	563400	And without really having not thought about it before, but certainly the dual pressure to find
563400	570840	a free energy minimizing solution, viewing free energy as an extensive quantity,
572200	577480	more simply, you know, the collective free energy being the joint free energy minimum solution.
577480	584040	You're asking us where the free energy just bounds the likelihood of this particular arrangement.
585240	595160	Then you're looking for the precise functional form of the free energy. And if you've got this kind
595160	602840	of a ponency between the similarity of the algorithm and the similarity of the content of the value,
603640	611800	then I can certainly see interesting behaviors arise in exactly the same spirit that you get
611800	621480	these interesting structures in not epithelia, but in the functional specialization of
621480	630600	cortical representations or sensory epithelia that try to sort of pack three dimensions into one
630600	636600	dimension or are accountable to two kinds of constraints. So again, without really thinking
636600	641000	about it, because I wasn't anticipating that particular question, but I think what you would be
642120	648280	the first thing that you would be looking for is basically what is the Lagrangian or the energy
648280	657560	function that is being minimized. So you could regard this as the sorting algorithm as an application
657560	665240	of the sorting algorithm as a process that is trying to minimize some energy function very
665240	669640	much in the spirit of Markov-Random fields, but in your instance, you just got a one dimensional
669640	678200	field. But the technology of Markov-Random fields I think would be apt to try to understand the
678200	685720	functional forms of the energy functions were under the special constraint, which of course is
685720	692040	the one that you're predicating this whole thesis on, that interactions are only local and therefore
692040	697880	any collective behavior has to be an emergent property, which is truly distributed. So the
697880	704280	definitive aspect of a Markov-Random field is you just have local, you just have local interactions.
704280	711160	And I think that's a really another important architectural feature that comes along with
711160	718120	the choice of the sorting algorithm, which you should foreground, because any distributed,
718120	725400	collective or emergent behavior at a scale beyond local interactions, that emergence
725400	731400	is truly emergent in the sense that all your interactions are local. And of course that is
731400	739480	what the Markov-Random field gives you. It says that you can only express the energy function,
740200	744840	which is the probability of getting this particular arrangement or these particular numbers
745640	754280	in this local clique. You can only express that in terms of a local energy function. And then
754280	758840	of course you can tell all sorts of stories about the importance of that for machine learning and
758840	765720	the like. But you probably want to stick to self-organization. So, and I would imagine the
765720	773960	energy function is now going to be some simple measure of the local differences of the local
773960	781560	gradients. And of course what one would anticipate would be a smoothing, a resolution of, as you say,
781560	791640	the differences. So I think that would be one way of approaching naturalizing this phenomena in
791720	799080	terms of maths by just invoking an arbitrary, not a variational free energy in the spirit of
799080	809160	the free energy principle, but just a Lagrangian or try to identify what is the generic free energy
809160	816200	function that's being minimized here. So that now your view through this sorting space or
816520	824360	your morphological space is now a progression on some wonderful landscape that is defined
824360	832920	by this free energy functional. And whether you can reverse engineer that or not, I don't think
832920	839320	it really matters other than because I think the nice aspect of that is then you can talk about
839960	847400	the dynamics on this free energy landscape. And once led then to very similar sort of notions
847400	854360	in computational chemistry and protein folding and the like, there's a very complex, sorry,
854360	859960	there is a complex Wellington landscape or free energy landscape that self-organization
859960	865160	and computational chemistry adheres to and can be understood in terms of free energy minimum.
865160	872440	Indeed, most of computational chemistry sort of follows this. And indeed, that is identifying
872440	879240	that landscape is the whole point of applying things like large language models or deep RL to
879240	889800	sort of protein folding and other applications. So that would be certainly one view to get a free
889800	897320	energy like formalism or naturalization of this behavior, which I repeat has lots of really
897320	903880	interesting links with self-organizing maps, marker, random fields, image reconstruction,
903880	910120	and self-organization in certainly in some things like the visual cortex, I don't imagine
910200	917320	any mapped representation would conform to these rules. To get this into a
919560	931080	to get it into a free energy principle story, I think you would have to commit to the notion that
931080	937320	each of the cell has its own boundary. And now you're starting to interpret each number
937320	945960	as a thing. And in so doing, acknowledge its openness to everything else, or in this instance,
945960	952920	just its neighbors, which will require sort of a by your formalism of the bi-directional exchange,
952920	960520	so that the value of my next door neighbor is something that I can sense and is, and likewise,
961320	967800	the broadcasting of my number to the next door neighbor is something is an action. So you've got
967800	975960	this openness that is mediated in the simplest way, which is just the broadcasting and sensing
975960	982520	of one unit dimensional, one number, if that is a discrete number. And the view like that,
982520	988680	that means you can then I think deploy the free energy principle in the sense that any
989640	996440	non equilibrium or far from equilibrium, steady state, which I think you would probably have here,
997240	999960	just in virtue of the fact that there is going to be some
1001080	1006360	breaking of detail balance in the itinerant way in which you move through this space in a
1006360	1012360	developmental to get to your steady state. One can imagine, well, perhaps not, but
1012360	1018920	you know, if one puts a little bit of dynamics into this, I would imagine you would advance very,
1018920	1029320	very clearly the breaking of detail balance, and you know, and have those kinds of solenoidal flows.
1031320	1038920	I mean, sorry, I distracted myself just by the addition of the frozen cells. That's one way of
1038920	1046760	breaking. In a sense, the detail balance, and you know, just open brackets. It's exactly the same
1046760	1056520	device that I resorted to in the very first paper on the life as we know it paper when
1056520	1062520	simulating the little macro molecules using Lorenz attractors that had inherent dynamics.
1062520	1069480	But to make it interesting, you had to have a small a certain popular number of the of the
1070040	1076600	synthetic macro molecules that were insensitive to influences from other macro molecules and
1076600	1081560	another proportion that could not influence the other one. So it's almost exactly the same
1082280	1088200	choice. And that's what gave it the interesting behavior. Otherwise, it just basically converged
1088280	1097800	either to a gas or it at a certain temperature, it would just convert to a crystal.
1099320	1104200	So both of them being steady state solutions, free energy minimizing solutions. But things got
1104200	1109320	interesting when you broke the detail balance symmetry breaking by having this
1110280	1118920	this, you know, this requisite variety in terms of the frozenness in terms of action or sensation.
1118920	1126360	So I think that's another that's another important thing to foreground. That this may be this
1126360	1132680	kind of requisite variety may be absolutely necessary for symmetry breaking. And in this
1132680	1139160	particular instance, breaking detail bounds to get this kind of cell biologically plausible
1139800	1146280	by mimetic kind of stuff organization, you're unlikely to get that if you're in the absence
1146280	1152760	of it in the sense that it would converge to a crystal in your instance, just a linear sorting
1152760	1158040	perfect sorting, which which is which is, you know, doesn't doesn't have that chimeric or itinerant
1158600	1165320	itinerant aspect to it. So sorry, close back it. So where were we? Oh, yeah. So
1165320	1173400	if you've got now an interesting system that has a non equilibrium steady state, and in your case
1173400	1178360	actually because you haven't got dynamics, it will also be an equilibrium steady state,
1178360	1184360	but it'll still be a free energy minimizing solution. Then you are perfectly entitled to
1184360	1192200	interpret the numbers as things and inferring things. And all they're trying to infer is the
1192200	1198600	cause of their sensations, which is just the value of the numbers on one side and the other side,
1198600	1208600	and they are broadcasting their inferences through broadcasting their own number, which of course
1208600	1217960	will be the average of well, when sorted, it will be the average of the neighboring numbers.
1217960	1224760	So on that view, I think you could very easily license an active inference interpretation
1224760	1231240	a teleology. You mean you would actually need this to simulate protein folding or self organizing
1231240	1237080	maps or anything, but you would be able to say there is a teleological interpretation of the
1237080	1243960	self organization using the rhetoric of inference and belief updating simply because we can treat
1243960	1251080	each number now as a Markov blanket and then something which will never be accessible, but we
1251080	1261960	can imply or induce internal to each number could be interpreted as an inference process,
1261960	1268840	and then the story, which you've already said what the answer is, under the assumption that
1269640	1277080	I live in a world that is maximally predictable, then everything around me is the same as me and
1277080	1286680	therefore I am going my free energy, my variational free energy minimizer is now going to be
1288360	1295400	bound when there's the least surprising input. And if I believe that everything is like me,
1296040	1306440	then that will be when the numbers that I am sensing in my peak are as similar to the estimate of
1306440	1314280	the number, the place that I should be coming back to our sort of no-deal place paper.
1315480	1325320	And I think that kind of story will have to be nuanced for the same algorithm
1326280	1333000	so I'd have to think about that a little bit more, but certainly at least at a narrative level or
1333000	1338440	a conceptual level I think you can tell the same story there that if the sequence of moves that I
1338440	1346200	see my neighbour doing in relation to what I know about my neighbour belies the same underlying
1346200	1354360	dynamic or algorithmic computations, then in some sense they are predictable if I have exactly the
1354360	1363080	same algorithm under the hood. And therefore, mathematically speaking, that would be the
1363080	1370280	free energy minimising solution if I can now read my broadcasting of the number as a broadcasting
1370280	1379080	my posterior beliefs about the number, the estimate of this locale, my niche
1379720	1389240	in this instance is just labelled with one number. So the number that I have
1390600	1397800	is basically my prior belief about my niche and I'm just now going to
1399000	1407240	move my niche around in a sort of egocentric frame until it is consistent with my prior belief
1407320	1413720	that this is my place, my niche is number 62 for example. And that should be, you should be
1413720	1421480	able to reproduce the same kind of sorting either analytically through showing that with an appropriately
1421480	1428280	configured Lagrangian or free energy functional that the system operationally appears to be
1428920	1436440	minimising, you can now write down the generative model and then show that this can also be
1436440	1444440	interpreted as an inference process. I repeat under the assumption that the best way to make the
1444440	1451800	world predictable is to surround yourself with things like you, which and also of course the
1451800	1457960	locality assumption that I can only talk to the person to whom I'm immediately connected.
1457960	1463080	So those are some of my thoughts but a lot of those were invented on the fly in response to
1463320	1469240	your question I'm afraid. Superb. I've got many questions but Adam why don't you ask yours?
1469240	1477480	Yeah, so it strikes me that up until now we've talked about the relevant sort of agent as being
1477480	1482840	the individual number with an algoritite. You can think of it as a cell but it strikes me that
1482840	1489480	there's an interesting macro phenomenon that occurs in the process of sorting which is that it
1489480	1497960	appears that the list actually minimizes the Komogorov complexity or the description length
1497960	1505160	necessary to render it. So let's just say you've got an unsorted list with random distribution
1505160	1513080	of algotypes and there's 10 items in the list. You would need to enumerate 10 numbers and 10
1513080	1517240	algotypes and there's no reason a priori to think that that would be compressible in any way.
1517880	1521000	I mean maybe maybe you'd get lucky and there'd be a string of a certain number,
1521000	1524440	a string of a certain algoritite but in the general case I think you'd actually need to
1524440	1532360	write out every single entry. But as the list starts to sort itself it actually starts to create
1532360	1538520	these longer strings of algotypes which means that the minimum description length actually gets
1538520	1544760	shorter. Yet you still need to write each number out but you can coarse-grain the descriptions
1544760	1549640	of the algotypes. You can say the first five numbers have the same you know algotype and then
1549640	1556200	the next three have the same and so on. Now that that's a macro phenomenon but I'm wondering if
1556200	1562280	there's any evidence or any research that suggests that sort of these self-organizing systems
1562920	1568840	have a tendency to minimize their description length to minimize the number of factors needed
1568840	1574360	or something like that. Because if that's the case then it gives us another view where there's
1574360	1581960	this sort of emergent complexity minimization happening at the collective level. Yes, no that's
1581960	1591240	an excellent point. I think the simple answer is yes absolutely and I can sort of give you my take
1591240	1597720	on the literature or the citations that you'd want to appeal to. But I should say it's going to be
1597720	1603800	a nuanced yes because of the particular focus on the clustering of the algotype. Now the algotype
1604360	1609320	induces a certain kind of dynamics into the game so it's not as simple as a self-organizing map.
1609320	1619400	It's how the map actually self-organizes so there's a process under the hood and that I think makes
1619400	1628120	it slightly more complicated than just understanding self-organized maps. But in terms of another thing
1628120	1632280	you might want to look into here of course and you probably know more about this than I do but
1633160	1636280	this has a lot of resonance with artificial life
1638040	1646280	games in the 1990s and 1980s. It also could be if you wanted to so do
1647320	1653800	interestingly linked to Stephen Wolfram's Ruliad which is also another local scheme
1654520	1662760	that generates everything apparently. There's the same sort of notion so he has algorithms
1662760	1669480	which he calls rules and the rules are recursively applied in a local fashion to generate everything
1670280	1679000	including black holes apparently and quantum physics and everything. There might be an
1679080	1685720	interesting point of contact here with these sorry but to come back to the simple answer yes
1685720	1692920	absolutely so certainly from the point of view of self-organization as described by the free
1692920	1697960	energy principle. So notice here the free energy principle is just a description of systems that
1697960	1704520	self-organize to a far from equilibrium non-equilibrium as I said he stayed. It's not a recipe for sorry
1704840	1713960	in its statement it is not a description or a theological description of inferential
1713960	1719880	processing. You are licensed to equip your explanation of the self-organization with
1719880	1725560	reference to inference but that's an application of the free energy principle in itself it's just
1725560	1733400	a description of anything that self-organizes or any things that self-organize. So in that sense
1735240	1740280	if there is self-organization under the hood and the free energy principle has to apply and you can
1740280	1747080	motivate the free energy principle along two lines one would be the sort of playing the Feynman
1747080	1762760	card which is basically looking at the minimization of free energy as an optimization process
1763480	1767640	which can be viewed as a gradient descent on sub-fitness landscape or free energy landscape
1767640	1775560	or into landscape or you can take the Russian perspective which would be the Kalmolov complexity
1775560	1783800	and from the Kalmolov complexity you get to Solov induction and from that you get to universal
1783800	1789240	computation which is the home of the minimum description length and minimum message length
1790120	1798440	so it's the algorithmic complexity version of free energy and so David McKay wrote a quirky
1798440	1808680	little paper I think 1992 for where he interpreted variational free energy in relation to minimum
1808680	1815480	message length using crypto analysis as a vehicle to tell that story but to my mind I think wonderfully
1815480	1821000	connected to two different two different perspectives on exactly the same phenomenon
1821000	1830200	the ways of describing self-organizing systems that basically both entail a minimization of complexity
1831240	1837240	a simplification an emergence of order of a particular sort that entails
1837320	1845480	either compression hence the minimum description or the minimum message length
1846200	1851800	view from the algorithmic complexity in terms of sort of you know rate coding theorems rate
1851800	1857240	distortion theorems and the like or you can write it down in terms of continuous probability
1857240	1863000	distributions and sort of follow through from the Feynman's path integral I think they're both
1863000	1871960	saying the same thing you know the way I think of this is the you know the end point of any
1871960	1879160	self-organizing thing or set of things is just going to be the most likely configuration that
1879160	1887960	they occupy given the kind of things that they are and that basically means that you can always
1888040	1898360	describe this in a statistical and theological sense as everything providing an accurate prediction
1898360	1906520	of what its sense is that is minimally complex in exactly the same spirit as the the way that you
1906520	1913720	would frame complexity in terms of lossy or not losses but lossy compression or minimum
1913800	1921160	description length or minimum algorithmic complexity so I think that if you if you
1923240	1927560	if you tell the story that the free energy is an extensive quantity which means that all the
1927560	1934040	set of numbers or any subset of numbers any partition will all will all look as if they
1934040	1941560	are minimizing a free energy functional then you can I think say that you know one view of this
1941560	1947960	functional is to minimize the complexity of the arrangement which should be manifest in terms of
1947960	1954680	a minimization of algorithmic complexity and you can use it I can never I can never remember
1955800	1961880	Zemmell Lippf or Lippf what do you know what I'm talking about there's one of these
1963560	1965720	hierarchical sequential entropy measures
1966440	1974280	you know there's one way of quickly enumerating the the algorithmic complexity so I think the
1975000	1980520	if you could join the dots that would be a really powerful view of this and indeed you know
1981400	1983560	it would be interesting if you could
1984040	1989640	just for using numerical experiments join the dots
1991320	2000120	quantitatively in terms of this handcrafted intuitive free energy Lagrangian just based
2000120	2005640	upon you given three numbers you have to now write down an energy function that is always
2005640	2013320	going to be minimized by the sorting algorithm so the endpoint conforms shares the same minima of
2013560	2017640	your energy function it could be really simple it could be this the two differences squared
2017640	2024520	and added together something as simple as that and if you can prove that the the minima of this
2025160	2036600	is the same is the same as the the endpoint of your self-organization then you can say this is one
2036600	2043800	free energy functional that very much in the spirit of hopfield nets and harmony functions
2043800	2052280	you know in the early days of neural networks spin glass models pots models all of these
2053560	2058520	mark of random fields you have to write down this kind of energy function and then you just
2058520	2062680	simulate you know you can you can just do a gradient descent or rearrangement in order to
2062680	2069480	minimize that so that's one very simple kind of free energy description of it then you'd have
2070440	2076200	an inferential one under an assumed generative model so if you assume each number actually
2076200	2080920	has a little mind and a generative model it's trying to estimate or trying to act upon its world
2080920	2086200	to realize its beliefs about what it's sensing you'd have a variational free energy but then you'd
2086200	2094760	also have the the algorithmic free energy that you could that apply to any partition
2094760	2101720	and the point that if you can show that all three all three share the same minimum at the point of
2103000	2108680	attaining non-equilibrium steady state I think that will be really you know a really nice illustration
2108680	2113720	that all of these are different facets of exactly the same thing I mean you know it is just a
2113720	2120280	description of self-organization but articulated in slightly different ways but I repeat you know
2120280	2131880	once you've got different algorithms I think the process of sorting now is is somewhat constrained
2131880	2140280	so that it's you know because you've got three different ways of doing this they may have different
2141240	2147640	they may have different functionals that are being minimized and it may be but I'm not absolutely
2147640	2154840	sure that the the order matters and as soon as the order matters then you've got dynamics in play
2154840	2160680	once you've got dynamics in play that I think slightly complicates the simple
2162520	2169880	algorithmic complexity argument because the algorithmic complexity the universal computation
2170040	2179080	view it's not really fit for purpose to understand dynamics of organization and indeed most people
2179080	2184360	would argue it's not fit for purpose to do anything because it's intractable but it's a
2184360	2195640	beautiful mathematical object does that make sense yeah so one thing then for with Adam's point so
2195720	2201960	I think that's a really interesting point and it raises another question which is if on the
2201960	2206760	compression so it's on the compression issue so if we say that what you're trying to compress is
2206760	2212440	the actual list of numbers plus the ordering of the algotypes then you know everything as you guys
2212440	2218680	just said but I wonder couldn't somebody argue that in fact there is no list of algotypes to
2218680	2224120	compress there's only the numbers because it's sort of like you know by the time you get to the end
2224920	2229640	it's kind of like it's immaterial information it doesn't do you know it gets lost by the time
2229640	2233560	you've sorted the numbers what do you need the list of algotypes for right they're not really
2234680	2241640	I don't know I there's something here no I don't think so like if you take the position that the
2241640	2248920	algotypes aren't relevant once they stop being used then you're imposing as an observer an assumption
2248920	2256520	that the list is finished moving right but like how do you know that yeah yeah no that's that's
2256520	2261480	that's super interesting and and and it's like the bigger question of there is this notion of
2261480	2266920	algotypes that maybe you have to take into account what else do you have to take into account that
2266920	2270840	we don't know about right like that's that's one of the things that I see is so interesting about
2270840	2276120	this and then the next thing I was going to ask you Carl is what's the status of the fact that
2276120	2280440	like all the things that we were just talking about about the cells you know being objects and
2280440	2284520	exchanging information with their neighbors about algotypes and having predictions I mean
2285240	2289000	none of that is actually in the algorithm you can see that the algorithm is like six lines of
2289000	2293240	code like you can see what the algorithm is none of that is there so what's you know it's more
2293240	2298120	of a philosophical question you know what what's the status of of something and I have the same
2298120	2301320	question when I first heard about you know photons and least action and all that I was like but there's
2301320	2306360	no mechanism to know you know to calculate which path you know is going to be best for you so
2306360	2313080	what do we do with this what what do we do I'm super interested in the sort of I don't know
2313080	2319560	why they're almost almost you know implicit things that it's doing whereas the explicit algorithm
2319560	2325480	doesn't have any of that what do you think about that um well probably think the same thing that
2325480	2335400	you do um I think um yep in a sorry in a sense what I was saying about a nuanced answer once
2335400	2342040	you're dealing with you know isomorphisms between the local algorithms was exactly this issue that
2342040	2348200	you bring to the table it's not you know um yeah it could be as simple as each algorithm has a
2348200	2352520	different objective function different free energy or lipoonov function
2354360	2361480	or it could be that they have the same but the the actual sequence of updates or moves
2361480	2367400	is somehow constrained so the movement on the same free energy surface is is it is somehow
2367400	2371560	constrained to be different so I'd have to know it precisely what the algorithms are
2372120	2377800	um it probably is the case that I'm just guessing um that they probably don't have
2377800	2383560	quite the same um objective function or or and often point of view the free energy principle
2383560	2391480	implicit generative model um so the chimerical um um self-organization is a reflection of the fact
2391480	2398040	that um not everything is trying to has the same generative model and therefore by definition
2398040	2404840	will not have the same free energy um functional so that that does complicate the situation and
2404840	2409800	makes it more interesting in fact um you know from the point of view of this this kind of
2409800	2417400	requisite variety um but now I've forgotten the your your actual question um which I did have
2417400	2422840	an answer to what can you remind me what the actual question was sure sure it's so so what
2422840	2426920	these algorithms have in common with some of the things that you and and chris fields have said
2426920	2430920	about particles and things and other people apart which is different from what happens in
2430920	2435320	biology right if if if in biology I said look this cell is exchanging information with that
2435320	2439560	cell and it's making decisions the next question is excellent what's the mechanism right like what
2439560	2444600	it like show me show me the the the explicit uh the set of steps by which this cell does that
2444600	2448760	but but here we don't have that and and presumably you know when we get down to particles and things
2448760	2452920	we don't have that either so what's what what's the status of these all these amazing things that
2452920	2460360	they're doing without a a mechanism to explicitly do it right and I'm going to give you an answer which
2462760	2470040	comes from conversations with philosophers of maths people like max or ramsted that that question
2470040	2480600	technically would be answered by appeal to what is a mechanics so a mechanics is um for example
2480600	2487880	the basic mechanics of the theology principle or Lagrangian or classical mechanics under certain
2489000	2501160	dynamics you know the non-dissipative or conservative so or quantum mechanics where
2501960	2509080	you can't uh you you you you have to focus exclusively on the on the dissipative dynamics
2509720	2516840	so the mechanics is a description of the realization of something
2518120	2525080	where the thing usually conforms to a principle of least action so this is where this is a sort
2525080	2531480	of deflationary answer to your question that the mechanics in and of itself is an emergent
2531480	2536520	property of a variational principle of least action that can be cast in gage theoretic terms or
2537080	2543080	or in terms of things like maximum entropy principles so there are principles
2544680	2554280	that just describe the shape the spacetime shape of our world these give rise to and usually you
2554280	2563000	can usually reduce all physics principles to principles of least action the the straight line
2563000	2569800	the path of least effort um um and once you've written you've written down your principle as a
2569800	2578440	principle of least action then the particular functional form of the system to which that
2578440	2587720	principle applies then gives you a mechanics and then that now um acquires a teleology in
2587720	2594920	conversation but only in conversation you don't need the mechanics mechanics does not engineer
2594920	2601320	anything it is just an expression of the principle of least action um so very much in the spirit of
2601320	2605160	basic mechanics are saying before the free energy principle is just a description of things that
2605160	2612360	self-organize you may or may not want to then go and say oh well this self-organization could be
2612360	2618440	described teologically as self-evidencing or active inference or decision-making or basal
2618440	2623720	cognition or distributed intelligence you don't have to do that but it sometimes it can be very
2623720	2630120	useful when talking to somebody else about it to to to teologically frame it like that and that I
2630120	2635880	think is your mission I think that's what you're bringing to the table in in the widest sense
2635880	2643320	you're saying that the mechanics of biotics self-organization have a certain tealogy which is
2643320	2649560	almost isomorphic to the same tealogy of finding psychiatry or immunotherapy or climate change
2650280	2655480	and we just got to find the cross-cutting themes so the mechanics the mechanisms
2657400	2663320	are really just tealogical unpacking of of of the mechanics so in this instance I gave you an
2663320	2670280	example before that simply the algorithm to implement the algorithm which is probably a
2670280	2676280	series of Boolean operators would need certain inputs they need arguments and they need certain
2676280	2682280	outputs those are the the sensory and active states those those define now the Markov blanket
2683240	2690440	then so you're taking the input is basically whatever my neighbor neighbor's value
2691640	2696760	whatever I can see and what I can see is my neighbor's value and it has to be a neighbor I
2696760	2703400	can't see but you know the one for yeah I can't see something along the way away so that defines
2703400	2708840	the input and the output is my particular number that's what I broadcast but I only broadcasted
2708920	2715560	in a loop in a local sense so when you're starting to express things in terms of a
2716840	2724600	a tealogy of self-organization of the kind that people use in you know in the free energy
2724600	2732040	principle I think you're then you're quite licensed to say well this is just a description for
2732040	2738600	example of electrochemical signaling you know it there's a magic is this is this is this is the
2738600	2748600	mechanism it just means that there has to be a local signal that reports or has some morphism
2748600	2757800	between my state and and you know everything that is not me and we find multiple instances of this
2757800	2763720	in in biology at different temperance spatial scales and you know the more you drill down the
2763720	2770520	more you actually specify what it is the more mechanistic you know it will become but you know
2771480	2776360	at the end of the day that's just the mechanics you're talking about so if you you know if you
2776360	2782520	wanted to describe self-organization of massive bodies that had no dissipative aspects to them
2782520	2786360	you know the motion of the planets for example if you if you take yourself back and pretend you
2786360	2793240	Kepler and you know what is the mechanics of motion of the heavenly bodies they're Lagrangian
2793240	2799160	conservative mechanics they inherit from the principle of least action that you know has a
2799160	2807560	relatively simple form before Einstein came along and in terms of you know energy conservation
2807640	2816280	and you know and all that is implicit in a pattern a path of least you know the least action least
2816280	2821480	action principle so that would be his kind of mechanics and you start to invent things like
2821480	2827800	gravity and mass and you know and talk about the teleology of massive bodies being attracted to
2827800	2835160	each other and that would be you know quite comfortably received as an intuitive mechanistic
2835160	2840600	explanation for the thing at hand which in this instance is a the motion of heavenly bodies
2840600	2845800	you know I I don't see there's any real problem from your point of view you've already told the
2845800	2854440	story you've already got the mechanics it's just you know a question of showing how universal this
2854440	2860840	kind of mechanics is and universal in the in the special context of local interactions
2861800	2869320	and all the all the consequences of having a principle or the principles that would apply
2869320	2875640	to self-organising systems out of equilibrium or non-equilibrium self-organisation, biotic
2875640	2883160	self-organisation what kind of mechanics must be in play and then you can give particular
2883240	2891000	exemplars and talk about gravity or cell intercellular signaling or you know and the
2891000	2897480	locality of that does that make sense yeah yeah yeah yeah and I guess Adam did you want to say
2897480	2904520	anything before I because I've got another okay so so this is kind of the the really
2904520	2908600	kind of far out thing and feel free to tell me that this is not a good analogy and you know
2908600	2914200	kind of too too too far out but I was thinking I was thinking about the analogy of us trying to
2914200	2919640	analyse these algorithms and what it is that what what are the causes of their behavior as we observe
2919640	2927320	them and trying to analogize to in a in a you know biological or maybe in a psychological
2927320	2933400	slash psychiatric context where you have what you think is the algorithm and maybe that's what
2933400	2937400	your subject thinks is the cause of their actions and maybe that's what you think is the cause of
2937400	2942600	their actions but it turns out that there's this underlying dynamic that is it's an extra goal
2942600	2947480	that you didn't know because you couldn't you you didn't see it in the in the steps of the
2947480	2953720	of the policies that they're supposedly following and I wonder if this is a sort of really basal
2953720	2959240	kind of I don't know I just just a really basal kind of behavioral analysis that might be important
2959240	2967320	for the larger and more complex systems in the sense of finding underlying goals for for
2967320	2973000	for complex behaviors that are not to be found in the by enumerating the mechanisms that you
2973000	2977480	know that are there which is you know like it basically basically looking at the tendency to
2977480	2983640	cluster as a as a hidden motivation for their behavior if I can use this kind of like psychological
2983640	2988360	term what do you think about that Zachary is that silly or are there oh no no I think that's
2989240	2995320	exactly the application of these principles and the attendant mechanics you know in terms of say
2995320	3004360	voting dynamics or geopolitical and or just a spread of information on the internet you know
3007320	3013480	I think some really important deep questions there and things you know why is it
3013480	3021640	that almost inevitably whenever you look at some ideological political or theological commitment
3021640	3028040	everybody's 50-50 you know Trump versus Biden Brexit versus stay you know wherever you look
3028920	3035240	the only evolutionary stable strategy on or for energy minimizing not an equilibrium steady state
3035240	3041320	is you know usually a 50-50 because that can be subdivided within what this this 50 percent
3041320	3046280	there's another 50 percent in a sort of self-similar way all the way down so there's some must be
3046280	3052760	something generically very important universal about that and I would imagine that's you know
3052760	3057720	you will see that kind of clustering it's interesting I didn't realize I didn't read
3057720	3063560	it Kevin have to realize you have this sort of the actual order wins out at the end of the day
3063560	3067080	so you get the increase and then the decrease in clustering that was interesting
3067720	3074280	I would be if I was a young man working for you as a PhD student I'd like to put a bit of
3074280	3079880	noise on the numbers and just see if you can keep it alive and dynamic and see that clustering and
3079880	3087640	that chimeric behavior look at its dynamics and you know something in dynamical systems
3087640	3094520	theory called frustration that you get in these in these chimeric situations when
3094520	3101400	you've broken detailed bounds like this which may be a good metaphor for voting dynamics for
3101400	3106840	example and so I think it's a very sensible idea I'm just reminded have you read that paper by
3106840	3116680	Connor Hines and if not I'll send it to you so he's he's he he was making an analogy between
3117640	3127880	Gibbs energy and free energy in terms of exchanging ideas as a model of
3130760	3137800	collective behavior and it may be you'll find some interesting ethological references
3138840	3145160	references to that yeah interesting that you know the thing about the thing about them being
3145320	3152040	pulled apart at the end so so one way one of the things that we did was to ask okay how how
3152040	3157400	strong would this tendency to cluster be if you if you didn't have this super overlying
3157400	3160920	being a basic physics of this world that eventually is just going to yank you apart
3160920	3165720	and and one way to do that is to allow repeat numbers so if I allow repeat numbers then you
3165720	3170440	can have a long run of fives and the first half of them could be one I'll go type the second half
3170440	3174200	could be the other and the actual sorting algorithm would be perfectly happy to keep them as is because
3174200	3178840	the fives are between the four yeah so so we did that and and when you do that you find out that
3178840	3183080	yeah if you let them do that it actually goes higher the the tendency to cluster is actually
3183080	3188440	higher that you know so there's this like competing you know and and again looking at it it almost
3188440	3196520	it almost provides a very minimal model of of the existential sort of I don't know way of life
3196520	3201400	facing living systems right that the physics of the world are like you're trying to grind you down
3201400	3205320	but but in the meantime you can do some interesting things that are not incompatible
3205320	3209240	with them there's no magic I mean it does the algorithm there's no you know there's no errors
3209240	3213880	but but but yet not quite what what the you know what what the end goal is going to be
3213880	3216840	according to the actual physics of the system yeah
