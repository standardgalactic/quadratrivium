0	12600	Thank you so much. That's very kind. And it's been a real honor and a privilege to get to
12600	17760	know Bill and work together on these projects. So thank you for inviting me here. This is
17760	21960	a new kind of audience for me. And I've put together a talk that I haven't given before.
21960	27720	So let's see how it goes. By the way, if anybody's interested afterwards in the details, all
27720	33080	of the sort of official peer-reviewed kind of stuff, the software, the papers, everything is
33080	38400	here. And then here are sort of a little bit more personal thoughts about what I think it all means
38400	45040	and things like that. So let's begin here. This is a well-known painting. It's called Adam Names
45040	50480	the Animals in the Garden of Eden. And there are two interesting things about this old story.
50480	56880	One of them, I think, is needs to really be redone and ditched. And the other one is very
56920	61320	profound. And I think it's going to be important for us going forward. The one that needs to be
61320	66320	dropped is this idea here that there are discrete natural kinds of beings. We know what they are.
66320	74120	Here are these large, mostly cute sorts of animals. There's Adam. We know what they are.
74120	77040	They're discrete. They're different from each other. Adam, of course, is different from all of
77040	84320	them. And that, as you're going to see in a minute, does not do justice to the incredible plasticity
84320	90280	of life. Our attempts to bin it into these categories is not going to fly. What is really
90280	96440	profound here, I think, is that in that original story, you may or may not know that neither God
96440	101000	nor the angels were able to name the animals. It was Adam that had to do it. The job was on him.
101000	106360	And there are a couple of reasons why that might be. One is because in these old traditions,
106360	110720	naming something or discovering the name of something means you've discovered something about
110720	115560	its true inner nature. And I think that's important because we, as humans, are going to have to
115560	121480	discover the inner nature of a very wide set of beings that Adam could not even have begun to dream
121480	126200	of. The other thing is, of course, Adam's the one that has to live with them. And so his understanding
126200	131800	of his world and the other beings around it is going to be critical for him to develop. So I
131800	138160	want to talk about a few things today. First is some thoughts on information, evolution, and
138160	143200	selves, this notion of collective intelligence and where it comes from. I want to talk about the
143200	149040	paradox of change and how biology handles it. Now, the paradox of change can be said as follows.
149040	155320	This is scaled to the level of evolution, but I think you will see the obvious implications for
155320	161600	personal and possibly company growth and things like that. The paradox is this, if you're a species
161600	168000	and you fail to change, you're going to go extinct. But if you do change, you likewise will, in an
168000	174000	important sense, cease to exist. So what does that mean? How do we, as beings, preserve ourselves in
174000	179640	some sense as we inevitably change? We change physically, we change mentally. If you don't
179640	184720	change mentally, you can't learn. So there's some sense in which profound educational process changes
184720	189200	you so that you're not the same, certainly growing up, but we'll do that and so on. So this is a
189200	194640	really interesting paradox and I'm going to show you how I think biology handles it. And we're
194960	201920	going to talk about a few other topics such as plasticity, diverse intelligence, and creative
201920	208880	interpretation, a.k.a. polycomputing that biology uses across scales. And we're going to look at it,
209360	214320	we're going to start our journey here through the eyes of a frog with an eye on its butt. Now,
214880	218400	if anybody asks you in the future, have you ever seen a frog with an eye on its butt, now you can
218400	224080	say yes. This is a frog we have made in our lab. This is not Photoshop. This is not AI. This is
224720	229200	a real eye on its butt. And the reason that these kinds of things are possible is because
229200	236000	biology commits to a certain kind of creative process to solve this problem. The way the way
236000	241120	that frog came to be is that we took a tadpole. So here's a tadpole, here's the brain, the nostrils,
241120	247760	the mouth, the gut, the tail. And what we did was we put some eyes, some eye cell precursor cells
247760	253120	on the back of this tadpole. The cells go ahead and they make an eye. I'll tell you another story
253120	258240	about ectopic eyes in a minute, but that's how we did this is by transplantation. You'll also
258240	262800	note that he doesn't have any primary eyes. So we prevented those from forming, but we put an eye on
262800	268480	his tail. And then we built this machine. This was an incredible ordeal. It took probably five
268480	274400	years, about a million bucks, which is huge for a lab, to build this kind of thing. And what the
274400	280080	machine does is test these tadpoles in visual assays. So basically, there's a little spot of
280080	286880	light and they have to either chase or stay away from the moving light in order to succeed in that
286880	291120	task. And we found out that they can see quite well. These eyes on their backs enable them to
291120	295520	see perfectly well. By the way, here's the optic nerve. You can trace it. It does not go to the
295520	300720	brain. It goes to the spinal cord and then it stops there. So notice what's happened here is that
300720	305920	this animal has a radically different sensory motor architecture. You've got now this weird itchy
305920	310400	patch of tissue on your back that's sending signals to your spinal cord. How does the brain know that
310400	316400	that's visual data and use it? And in particular, why doesn't that take extra evolutionary cycles?
316400	321280	You know, cycles of mutation, selection, it's just ready to roll. You've drastically changed
321280	325760	this architecture that's been the same for millions of years and suddenly it works. And it
325760	331360	works because evolution doesn't actually make specific solutions to specific problems. It makes
331360	337680	problem-solving agents. And embryos, as I'll point out in a few minutes, can't take much for
337680	343360	granted. They solve these things on the fly, which is why this works. Now, what this has to do with
343360	354160	collective intelligence is this. We all started life right here as a single cell. I once pointed
354160	360160	out to somebody, I was doing some expert witness work and they were trying to, one of the attorneys
360160	366160	was trying to say that our work in frog was not relevant to humans. And he said, don't frogs come
366160	370400	from an egg? I said, will you come from an egg? And this was like everybody thought I was insulting
370400	375120	him, you know, the judge bang the thing. But let's remember, we all come from an egg. We all come
375120	380960	from a single cell. And that's a little blob of chemistry and physics. And that slowly and gradually
381600	388640	gives rise to one of these remarkable morphologies. And there is no magic spot, no lightning flash
388640	393520	that says, okay, you wore physics, but now you're a real cognitive individual. Now, mind comes into
393520	400080	the picture. This is slow and gradual. So we, then as scientists and philosophers, do need to understand
400080	404080	how does that scaling work? How do you get from a system that's well-described by chemistry and
404080	410480	physics? And as I'll mention, actually, not with zero cognitive capacity, it's small, but it's not
410480	417680	zero. How do you get here? And let's remember that we humans with our magical, agential glow
417760	423280	are not discreetly different from all of these other things. We stand at the intersection of two
423280	430480	enormous continuums where you can both, both evolutionarily and developmentally. And then,
430480	434560	you know, through biological change and through technological change, there are all kinds of
434560	440880	interesting beings that we're going to need to get to know. So that's a little disturbing. And a lot
440880	445440	of people, a lot of people, they send me emails about how disturbed they are to find out that
445440	450880	they were basically a scale up from a single cell. But at least we're a true unified intelligence,
450880	455920	right? So like we're not like a collection of ants or termites or something that you can talk
455920	460320	about an ant colony as a collective intelligence, but we're an actual true unified intelligence,
460320	467680	right? Well, wrong. So this is Descartes, who really liked the pineal gland. And the reason
467680	471760	he liked the pineal gland is that there's only one of them in the brain. And he felt that our
471760	477200	unified human experience should be associated with a structure in the brain. That's unique, not
477200	481840	bifurcated, not to like the hemispheres or all these other structures. It should be the only one.
481840	486960	Well, if he had had access to good microscopy, he would have looked inside the pineal gland and
486960	490640	you would have seen that, wait a minute, there's not one of anything. It's made of a bunch of cells.
490640	495680	Each one of these cells has all this stuff in it. So look at this. These are all the things that are
495680	500800	inside of each cell. And there's plenty more. This is only what we know to stain at this point.
500800	507280	And so all intelligence is collective intelligence. We are all built of a kind of multi-scale
507280	512240	agential material. This is a single cell. This happens to be a free living organism known as
512240	516880	a lacrimaria. But look, this is what a single cell can do. There's no brain. There's no nervous
516880	524240	system. He's handling all of his local needs with, and this is real time. So incredible anatomical,
524240	532480	physiological, and metabolic control and so on. And so we're all made of collections of these.
532480	536480	And the thing about being a collective intelligence is that you need cognitive glue.
536480	541920	Now what I mean by that is, here's a rat that's been trained to press a lever, get a reward.
541920	546400	There is no single cell here that has had both experiences. So the cells at the bottom of the
546400	552080	feet interacted with the lever. The cells in the gut got the delicious sugar reward. But no single
552080	557200	cell had both of these experiences. So who owns the associative memory? Who is it that knows that
557200	563120	these two things are tied? It isn't any individual cell. It is the rat. So you've got this. You've
563120	570720	got what you need is a set of mechanisms that are able to provide the system with memories,
570720	575440	preferences, goals, and other cognitive properties that the individual parts don't have.
576000	582320	Now we're used to thinking about ones like this, and creatures like this are fairly,
583920	589120	the rat doesn't change too much, but there are many other creatures that show us something
589120	596320	really remarkable. So here are some flatworms, some plenarium. You can train them to understand
596320	601120	that these little bumpy circles that we've laser etched into the bottom of the dish are where they
601120	606160	get fed. So the liver shows up on these little circles. The other amazing thing about plenaria
606160	611520	is that they regenerate. So you can cut them into pieces. The record is something like 276 pieces,
612080	616960	and if you cut them in half here, this tail will sit there doing nothing for about eight days. It'll
616960	621600	grow a new head, and then behavior begins, and you find out that these animals remember the
621600	626800	original information. So the information is not exclusively in the brain because you can cut off
626800	634320	the entire head. It is somewhere else. However, it is imprinted onto the new brain as it develops.
634320	638960	And so you can do all kinds of interesting thought experiments, like the old malfunctioning
638960	643280	transporter, and ask, okay, if we cut them into pieces, who's the original plenaria, and so on.
643280	648640	So right away you get into these issues of personal identity. You get into where is behavioral
648640	653360	information? How does it move through the body? How does it imprint it onto new brains? How do
653360	658000	brains know how to interpret? Just like I showed you in the tadpole, the brain knows how to interpret
658000	663440	information coming off of its spinal cord. How does this brain know that whatever the tail is
663440	669040	telling it is actually behavioral information that the brain can use? But it goes even beyond that.
669680	675280	It's not just about maintaining the information. Here's one of my favorite examples. So here's
675280	679920	a caterpillar, two-dimensional. You can model it as a soft-bodied robot with a particular
679920	685360	controller, and that's suitable for moving soft bodies that have no hard elements, so you can't
685360	689760	push on anything. So these things crawl around and they eat leaves, and they have a brain that's
689760	694960	well suited for that. They have to turn into this. This is a butterfly that flies in three-dimensional
694960	700640	space, doesn't eat leaves, it drinks nectar. And in order to change the brain from this to that,
700640	705840	you basically undergo this remarkable transformation process that dissolves most of the brain.
705840	710000	Many of the cells die, most of the connections are broken, but what you find out is that if you
710000	716560	train the caterpillar to seek out leaves on a particular color disc, the butterfly will do
716560	720640	the same. Now there's a few amazing things here. You can ask questions like, what's it like to be
720640	726800	a creature in the process of changing so radically? Questions like that, and you can ask where is
726800	730800	the memory? If the brain is being refactored, where does it keep those memories? But there's a
730800	738160	deeper issue here, which is that butterflies don't eat the same stuff that caterpillars eat,
738160	743760	and they don't move the same way the caterpillars move. So having the exact memories of a caterpillar
743760	749920	is completely useless. What it has to do actually is interpret whatever the engrams, whatever the
749920	757040	memory traces that the caterpillar leaves, it has to reinterpret them for its new context. So in its
757040	762480	new higher dimensional life, it doesn't carry the exact memories of its previous life, but it
762480	767360	carries the deep lessons that it's learned. And the trick here is that it has to know how to
768320	774080	remap them onto its own architecture. So you can read a lot more about this in this preprint
774080	781520	that I just put up a few days ago. So the interesting thing is that these worms and
781520	786880	caterpillars and so on, we shouldn't just think about them as this sort of bizarre
786880	794000	aspect of biology that has nothing to do with us. Because if you think about the slices of
794000	799440	our own life at any given moment, you don't have access to the past. The only thing you have access
799440	806080	to are the engrams, the traces of past experience that your past self has laid down in your brain,
806080	812560	in your body, in notepads, in various outsourced kinds of things. You have to reinterpret those
812560	818240	memories at every point. You have to reconstruct actively the story of who you are, what you are,
818960	825200	what your various commitments and beliefs are from the molecules and the energy patterns that are
825200	829600	in your body. And you have to tell a story about what they add up to. This is what our brain does
829600	834960	all the time. One way to think about this is that memories are messages from your past self.
835680	840240	Just the way that you exchange messages laterally with other beings at your current
840240	846880	time point. These memories are messages from a past self. And like any act of communication,
846880	851840	you're not actually required to interpret these messages in the way that the sender intended.
851840	856800	You are free to reinterpret them, however it's best for you. And not only are you free to do that,
856800	860880	you actually have to do that because you will change. Your body will change, the environment
860880	867280	changes. Even for humans, there's turnover. There's molecular turnover and cellular turnover
867280	872480	all the time. So all of these messages have to be turned over. And the way that this works,
872480	881440	you can imagine that these engrams, these memory traces are like this middle node, this narrow
881440	885600	little middle node in what this is probably familiar to many of you, this kind of
885600	893680	this architecture that's used like an autoencoder kind of thing where it squeezes down
894480	898880	all of the information that's come before because you don't want it to remember the exact data.
898880	903280	You want it to remember patterns. And then you pass the bottleneck, you want this side to
903280	909040	reinflate those patterns into whatever makes sense on the other end. Biology has this everywhere in
909040	914000	gene regulatory networks and voltage at the center of bioelectrical circuits in biomechanical
914000	919760	networks. This architecture is absolutely everywhere because this is what enables information to
919760	925600	preserve salience, not accuracy, but salience and utility on the other end. Now this will only work
925600	935360	if the two ends of this thing are smart. They have to undertake some effort to interpret
935360	943120	and encode what's going on here. So our bodies are made of a multi-scale competency architecture.
943120	949680	Every level of this is in fact smart in the sense that it has a competency to solve various problems.
949680	954960	So whole bodies of course solve problems in three-dimensional space, various kinds of behaviors,
954960	961920	but your molecular networks, your subcellular organelles, your cellular components, your organs,
961920	967040	tissues, all of these things solve problems in other kinds of spaces. And in fact, one thing
967040	974240	that evolution has done is to pivot some of the same tools and tricks for navigating problem spaces
974240	978480	across these various spaces. So we started off metabolic space and then physiological space and
978480	983120	then genes came along and you could navigate gene expression space and then multicellularity came
983120	989040	along and you could navigate anatomical space, the space of possible large-scale shapes. And then,
989040	992960	of course, brains and muscles showed up and you could do behavioral space and then eventually
992960	997680	linguistic space. And it turns out from some recent work in our group that actually some of
997680	1004720	the exact same ideas from navigating these other spaces you can use to help AIs navigate linguistic
1004720	1012480	space and keep track of a story longer and longer and so on. So Alan Turing, who obviously needs
1012480	1018800	no introduction, who was very interested in minds and intelligence and different embodiments of
1018800	1024480	intelligence and machines and so on, he was studying intelligence through reprogrammability,
1024480	1029200	right? He was interested in programmable hardware and plasticity. Interestingly,
1029760	1035280	he wrote this paper, The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis. It's one of the earliest works on
1035280	1040800	the mathematics of how order might arise in chemical systems like that egg that I showed you.
1040800	1047120	So he was interested how do you, how does the egg self-assemble? How do the chemicals assume
1047120	1051760	some sort of order? Now, why would somebody who was interested in mathematics and computer science
1051760	1057760	and so on be interested in this question? And I think that he saw a very profound kind of
1058560	1063360	invariance that I think if he had lived longer, both biology and computer science would be much
1063360	1070080	further along because what he realized was that the story of the appearance of minds is fundamentally
1070080	1075440	the same story as the story of the self-assembly of the body, right? The factors that put together
1075440	1080400	your body should be really important for understanding where minds come from. So let's
1080400	1085600	ask where do anatomies come from? So you start life as a collection of embryonic blastomeres.
1085600	1090240	This is a cross-section through an adult human. Look at the amazing order. All of the organs,
1090240	1093920	they're the right size, the right shape. Everything is next to the correct thing.
1094800	1100880	Where does this amazing order come from? Where is this pattern written down? And so if you ask,
1100880	1105520	even nine-year-olds, I've given talks to middle schools and they will immediately say, well,
1105520	1110320	it's in the DNA. It's in the genome. But the thing is that we can read genomes now. And actually,
1110320	1114880	this was apparent long before, but now we know for sure because we can read genomes. None of this
1114880	1121360	is directly in the genome. What's in the genome are the specifications of the proteins, the tiniest
1121360	1126800	hardware, the molecular hardware that cells get to have. This pattern, any more than the actual
1126880	1132560	structure of the termite colony or the precise pattern of a spider web are not in their genome.
1132560	1136800	This is not directly in our genome either. Where this comes from is the working out of
1136800	1143280	the physiological software that this hardware enables. And so we have to ask a number of questions.
1144000	1148400	Given that DNA specifies the hardware, where does the anatomy come from? How do cells know
1148400	1153120	what to make and when to stop? If a piece is missing, people like us want to know how do you
1153120	1159760	repair it? How do you convince them to regrow what they need to regrow? And as engineers,
1159760	1163440	we also ask, well, what else are they willing to do if we knew how to communicate with them?
1163440	1168800	And I could do a whole thing here on the anatomical compiler and some of those ideas.
1168800	1173280	But if we knew how to communicate with these cells, what else would they be willing to build?
1173280	1175840	And I'm going to show you some of those towards the end of the talk.
1175840	1181040	Now, one cool thing about this process is that it's not hardwired. This is not simply the emergence
1181040	1186480	of complexity. This is actually the emergence of intelligence. What kind of intelligence? Well,
1186480	1191600	goal-directedness of a certain kind in anatomical space. So here, this is an amazing creature,
1191600	1197760	this axolotl. And they regenerate their limbs, their eyes, their jaws, portions of the brain
1197760	1201760	and heart and so on. And if they lose a limb, and they do this all the time, they bite each other's
1201760	1207600	legs off constantly, wherever they lose the limb, the cells will work very hard to build exactly
1207600	1211440	what's needed, and then they stop. And that's the most amazing thing about this process is they
1211440	1216960	know when to stop. How do they know when to stop? Well, they stop when the correct axolotl arm has
1216960	1221840	been completed. It's a process of anatomical homeostasis. If you deviate them from their goal,
1221840	1227920	they will get right back there and then they stop. By the way, this is not just for weird organisms.
1229360	1232320	Mammals are a little bit regenerative, so humans can regenerate their liver.
1233280	1239680	Kids up to a certain age can regenerate their fingertips. And deer can regenerate bone
1239680	1244560	and vasculature and innervation up to a centimeter and a half per day of new growth when they're
1244560	1248960	doing this. So we have some of these capacities, but not terribly much. And I want to show you
1248960	1255360	one of my favorite examples of this kind of intelligence and what it means to be a being
1255360	1261920	coming into this world. This is a cross-section through a kidney tubule in the in the in the
1261920	1268240	nude. So normally it's made of eight to ten cells or so. But one trick you can do is by
1269600	1274640	increasing the number of nuclei of actually genetic material in these cells, you can make
1274640	1278000	the cells much larger. So the cells will scale to the amount of genetic material,
1278720	1283520	but the nude stays the same size. And the only way you can do that is by using fewer cells to
1283520	1289520	build the same structure. And so the first amazing thing is that you could have extra copies of all
1289520	1295360	your genetic material. No problems. Everything still works. Second, you can have huge cells,
1295360	1300080	and you will scale the number appropriately. No problem. The most amazing thing happens when
1300080	1305200	you make truly enormous cells. And at that point, one cell will just bend around itself and give you
1305200	1309680	that same lumen. Now this is a completely different molecular mechanism than this. This is cell to
1309680	1315120	cell communication. This is cytoskeletal bending. So this is top-down causation. In the service of a
1315120	1320640	particular journey and anatomical space that that this system needs to make, it can use different
1320640	1325680	tools in its disposal. It can use different molecular tools to get the job done. And we can ask all
1325680	1331440	kinds of interesting questions about how did it know that that was the thing to do? But just think
1331440	1336720	about what it means to be a nude coming into this world. You can't depend on anything. Never mind the
1336720	1341760	environment. Never mind the injury that somebody else might come along and bite your leg off or
1341760	1347040	something. You can't even count on your own parts. You don't know how many copies of your chromosomes
1347040	1350400	you're going to have. You don't know what the size of your cells are going to be. You don't know how
1350400	1355600	many cells you're going to have. You have to come in and on the fly, you have to take this journey
1355600	1361360	in anatomical space, and you can't overtrain on your evolutionary priors. You cannot assume any of
1361360	1366080	the things that were true in evolution going back. Not just about the environment, but about
1366080	1372640	yourself. So a very long story, very short. We've been studying how all these things work, and what
1372640	1379120	we basically found out is that the capacities of brains and nervous systems for dealing with novelty,
1379120	1384480	for intelligence, for navigation, for keeping memories and pursuing goals and all of that,
1385120	1389680	those capacities are actually incredibly ancient. They're driven by a kind of
1389680	1395680	electrophysiological software that is produced in the brain by these little ion channels
1396720	1400080	that set voltages, and these voltages can propagate through the network, and you get
1400080	1404800	this electrical activity that you can imagine going on in the brain. But that mechanism is
1404800	1409840	extremely ancient. It's not really specific to brains at all. Evolution discovered it about
1409840	1415920	the time of bacterial biofilm, so very long ago. And all cells have these ion channels,
1415920	1420720	most cells have these electrical synapses. Your whole body is a giant electrical network
1420720	1425840	that has many of the capacities that your brain has, but it does them slower. So if you take almost
1425840	1430800	any neuroscience paper, and you just do a find, replace, and in fact, we made an AI system to
1430800	1435440	do just this for people, it basically flips some words around, you know, if instead of neuron,
1435440	1440000	you say cell, and instead of millisecond, you say hour, you basically get a pretty reasonable
1440000	1445520	developmental biology paper about how, whereas your brain thinks about moving you in three
1445520	1450320	dimensional and now linguistic space, the rest of your body has been thinking about how to move
1450320	1455040	you through anatomical space from being an egg to being, you know, whatever, whatever we become.
1455760	1460320	So I just want to show you a small piece of what happens when we understand something like this.
1460320	1465280	This is, this, these electrical networks are literally the cognitive medium of the
1465280	1469840	collective intelligence of your body cells, whereas you are the product of the collective
1469840	1474160	intelligence of your neurons, your body is the product of the collective intelligence of the
1474160	1479440	rest of your cells behaving in anatomical space. And when we learn this interface,
1480240	1485920	this bioelectrical interface, we get access to an API that's very, very powerful. Here's one
1485920	1490400	example. And by the way, just to say none of this has to do with applied electric fields,
1490400	1495280	there are no electrodes, no magnets, no waves or frequencies or anything like that. We're hacking
1495280	1500080	the natural interface that cells use to shape each other's behavior, which is the set of ion
1500080	1507440	channels and gap junctions on their surface. And so, so we can, we can, for example, insert
1507440	1512320	some, some potassium channel proteins here to create a particular voltage pattern. And that
1512320	1516800	voltage pattern is a signal to these cells. And what these cells will do is build an eye. This
1516800	1521040	is not like the eye I showed you before, that was a transplant. This is not like that. We have said
1521040	1525600	to these cells, which normally make a gut, we've said, here's a particular voltage pattern. It's,
1525600	1529680	it happens to be the same pattern that they normally use to make an eye. And the cells see it,
1529680	1533760	and they build an eye. Okay. And these eyes, if you section them, have the same lens, retina,
1533760	1537520	optic nerve, all this stuff. Now notice a couple of interesting things. First of all,
1537520	1541920	like any good subroutine call, we did not have to give it all the information on how to build an
1541920	1545360	eye. In fact, we don't have any idea of how to build an eye. We don't know how to talk to all the
1545360	1550800	stem cells, all the genes that are there that have to be turned on eyes very complex. And we don't
1550800	1557920	want to, we want a high level stimulus that prompts the cells to do what they already know
1557920	1562960	how to do. So that's the first thing. The second thing is, here, this is, this is a lens sitting
1562960	1567440	out in the flank of a tadpole somewhere. The blue cells are the ones that we actually injected
1567440	1571840	with our ion channel, but there's not enough of them to make an eye. And so what they've done is
1571840	1576880	they've recruited all these other normal cells to participate with them to be an eye. And in fact,
1576880	1582400	we've studied, there's a conversation that happens, these blue cells acquire a new belief. They believe
1582400	1586400	that they should be an eye and they tell all the other cells, hey, you should be working with us
1586400	1590880	to make an eye. These other cells, actually, what are they saying? They're saying, no, we should be
1590880	1596640	skin or gut or whatever. And so they have this back and forth conversation. And sometimes these guys
1596640	1602160	win and you get an eye. And sometimes the rest of the cells win and they ignore us and stay whatever
1602160	1607120	tissue they're supposed to be. There are other collective intelligences like ants that do this
1607120	1611360	when, you know, two ants or a couple of ants discover something that it's too big for them to
1611360	1615840	carry by themselves. They recruit their neighbors. So all these competencies, you know, this ability
1615920	1621840	to hold a goal in anatomical space to try to convince others of your goal to get buy into your
1621840	1626320	story about what should happen and sometimes you win and sometimes you lose that battle. All of these
1626320	1631440	are native competencies of the tissue. We didn't have to build in any of that. It's already there.
1631440	1636160	And in the plan area, I told you that they regenerate. And if you cut off the head and the tail,
1636160	1641440	this middle piece will reliably regenerate this normal worm with the right number of heads.
1641440	1645600	Here's the bioelectric pattern memory. This is now, we're literally seeing the memories.
1645600	1650160	Think of it as a brain scan, except not in the brain. We're literally seeing the
1652560	1657680	representations in this tissue of how many heads a normal planarian should have. So we can go ahead
1657680	1660960	and change them. We have the technology instead of one head, we can say, no, you should have two
1660960	1666320	heads. And here's a perfectly normal animal whose tissues, not the animal itself, not the brain,
1666320	1675120	but the tissues have been incepted with a new memory that says that if you should get cut in
1675120	1679440	the future, so this is a counterfactual. It's not true now, but if you get cut in the future,
1679440	1683040	a proper worm should have two heads. And so if you cut that worm, this is what you get. And
1683040	1689920	again, not Photoshop. These are real. So a single worm body, a perfectly normal and anatomically
1689920	1695760	normal worm body can store at least two different ideas of what it will do in the future if it
1695760	1700400	should happen to get injured. And the reason I call this a pattern memory, it's a memory of the
1700400	1705360	collective intelligence of the body. The reason I call it a memory is because if you then go ahead
1705360	1712080	and you cut these two headed worms in perpetuity, they maintain two headedness with no more change.
1712080	1717040	And so this has all the properties of memory. It's stable, but it's rewritable. By the way,
1717040	1721600	not genetic. We haven't touched the genetics. The genetics are completely untouched. So the
1721600	1728560	question of where is the anatomy of this, the answer, the genome is not really the right answer.
1728560	1734800	Yes, the genome encodes hardware that by default will say one head, but that hardware is reprogrammable
1734800	1740640	and here you can have these nice, you can push it into this other state. And by the way, you could
1740640	1745920	push it into a state belonging to other species. So this nice triangular headed planarian can make
1745920	1751280	flat heads like a Pifolina, round heads like an S Mediterranean. This hardware, again, with no genetic
1751280	1756640	change, this is just by altering the bioelectrical patterns that serve as the memory here. They
1756640	1761440	will visit these other attractors in the anatomical state space where these other creatures normally
1761440	1769040	live about 100 to 150 million years of evolutionary distance. But that's okay. This hardware can
1769120	1775360	visit there if pushed. And of course, not just the shape of the head, but actually the shape of
1775360	1780640	the brain, the distribution of stem cells are all the same like these other species. So what we're
1780640	1785280	seeing here is the, first of all, the hardware, software distinction in biology, the reprogrammability
1785280	1792720	of biology, the API, once you understand how the cognitive glue works that binds individual cells
1792720	1797200	into a more global vision of what they should be doing, now you can start communicating with it,
1797280	1802720	rewriting goals, and really collaborating with the material. This is, you know, I do a whole
1802720	1808720	other talk on engineering with agential materials. This is not metal and Legos. This is an
1808720	1812640	agential material. You're a collaborator with that material. You're not micromanaging it.
1813440	1819360	So let's think about where these cells come from. So here's a blaster term. Let's say it's,
1819360	1824480	you know, 10 or 50,000 cells in the beginning. We look at that and we say, oh, that's one embryo.
1824480	1828080	What are we counting when we say that's one embryo? What is there really one of?
1828080	1833600	But what we're really counting is stories. We're counting how many different stories there are
1833600	1838400	in this tissue that the cells are committed to as far as where they're going to go in anatomical
1838400	1843520	space. We're counting commitment and they're aligned. All of these, under normal circumstances,
1843520	1847440	all of these cells are aligned there. They've bought into one single story and this is what
1847440	1852480	they're going to build. That's what we mean when we say there's one embryo. You might ask a similar
1852480	1856560	question in the brain. If I showed you a human brain and you didn't know what a human was, you
1856560	1863200	could ask, so how many individual cells fit here? Like, what's the density of cells per, you know,
1863200	1868480	per unit volume of this medium? And computers, we kind of have some idea of how much information
1868480	1874480	fits into a certain number of transistors or whatnot. But here we actually don't know.
1874480	1881440	And the amazing thing is that if you take this early embryonic blaster and use a needle to scratch,
1881920	1886160	put some scratches into it, and I used to do this in duck embryos when I was a grad student,
1887040	1891120	what happens is that each of these little islands doesn't feel the presence of the others
1891120	1897280	for a while until it heals up. And so it goes and self-organizes an embryo. And then you get conjoined
1897280	1902320	twins like this. You can get triplets. You can get all sorts of things. And so a couple of interesting
1902320	1907520	things here. First of all, the number of individuals that come out of this excitable medium is not
1907520	1912240	known in advance. It's certainly not determined by the genetics. It could be zero, one, probably up to
1912240	1917360	half a dozen. So how many cells, how many individuals are really in there? Well, you don't know until
1917360	1922560	they self-organize. And that process of self-organization is critical. One of the things they
1922560	1927280	have to do is determine boundaries. Where do I end and the outside world begins? Or in this case,
1927280	1932240	some other embryo begins. Actually, some of the cells at this intersection are a little confused.
1932240	1936800	That's why in conjoined twins, one of the twins will often have a laterality defect.
1936800	1942480	We actually figured out why in the 96 for the first time. Why conjoined twins tend to have a
1942480	1946080	laterality of flipping in one of the twins? It's because these cells can't quite tell,
1946080	1950000	am I the right side of this guy or am I the left side of this guy? But overall,
1950000	1955920	they have to establish their boundaries. And the analogy to the brain is actually still apropos
1955920	1961120	because we have lots of examples of split brain patients, dissociative identity disorders,
1961120	1965920	all of these kinds of things where it's entirely not obvious that our brain is host to just one
1966800	1974240	coherent self. And so one way that I've been working on to start thinking about how to
1975920	1982960	understand beings, goal-directed beings in very different embodiments is to put aside the question
1982960	1988240	of what you're made of or whether you were engineered or evolved and really just to ask
1988240	1994800	about the size of your goals. What's the largest goal you're capable of pursuing? And so that gives
1994800	1998480	rise to this idea of a cognitive light cone. It's kind of like a Minkowski cone except a little
1998480	2004000	bit upside down. And so if you collapse a space onto this axis and time onto this axis, you can
2004000	2009920	see that different kinds of creatures can have different scopes to the goals that they can
2011040	2015600	conceive of. I mean, humans actually may be uniquely, their cognitive light cone is bigger
2015600	2020560	than their own lifespan. And that may provide some for some interesting psychological pressures.
2020560	2024400	If you're a goldfish, you may have some goals 20 minutes into the future,
2024400	2028800	but those goals are probably pretty achievable. It's very likely that you will live for the
2028800	2033600	next 20 minutes. So all your goals are achievable. For many humans, they know their goals are
2033600	2038000	guaranteed not achievable because they can see and commit to goals that are bigger than their
2038000	2046320	known lifespan. So for now anyway, this is something that makes humans kind of unique.
2046320	2052160	And then of course, we are all compound bodies of lots of little subunits that have their own
2052160	2058400	goals in various spaces that compete, cooperate, and interact with each other. Now, this kind of
2058400	2064080	this crazy way of thinking about things as this cognitive light cone has clinical implications.
2064080	2070000	And I like this not just because I want to make advances in biomedicine, but also because this
2070000	2076240	is how we know that some of this philosophizing is actually on the right track. So this
2076560	2083680	is the tiny cognitive light cone of a single cell. All it really cares about is the state's
2083680	2089600	locally here. But what evolution did is scale it up via mechanisms that I haven't really had time
2089600	2093920	to talk about, but bioelectricity is one of them. It's now the cognitive light cone is huge. It's
2093920	2098480	the size of this whole limb. All of these cells, they're not pursuing their own local agendas,
2098480	2104880	they're pursuing this triangle. But that has a failure mode. And that failure mode is cancer.
2104880	2110160	So once individual cells disconnect from the network, they roll back to their unicellular
2110160	2116640	cells. They can't conceive of these grandiose goals anymore. All they can remember is proliferate
2116640	2122080	as much as you can and eat as much as you can and go wherever life is good. And this is a human
2122080	2129520	glioblastoma. That's cancer. And so one of the things you might do then is on this weird way
2129520	2134160	of looking at things is instead of targeting the genes or being worried about genetic
2135200	2138560	defects or trying to kill these cells with toxic chemotherapy, you might say, well,
2138560	2144080	what if we just forcibly reconnect them to the rest of the organism? So here's a tadpole injected
2144080	2148960	with a human oncogene. And the bioelectric imaging already tells you, yeah, here's the first thing
2148960	2152960	that happens when these cells transform is they disconnect electrically from the rest of the
2152960	2158800	body. They acquire this aberrant voltage pattern. And if we co-inject an ion channel, it doesn't
2158800	2163840	kill the cells. In fact, you can see here, the red is the oncoprotein. It's very strong. In fact,
2163840	2169040	it's all over the place. This is the same animal. There's no tumor because even though the hardware
2169040	2175520	of these guys is a little screwy because they've got this oncoprotein, they're being forced
2175520	2181600	informationally to be part of this continuum. And that causes them to be part of a collective
2181600	2187120	intelligence that just builds nice organs. Now, again, we're able to do all this, make eyes and
2187120	2192160	normalize tumors and induce like regeneration in animals that don't regenerate and so on.
2192160	2196800	Not because we're so smart or we're doing some kind of crazy synthetic biology. All we're doing
2196800	2202640	is hacking the native competency of the tissue. And by the way, oh, and one other thing I wanted
2202640	2207520	to say is that these cancer cells are not more selfish than normal cells. There's a lot of game
2207520	2211040	theory that models cancer is being more selfish. I don't think they're more selfish. I think they
2211040	2217440	have smaller selves. So you can be as selfish as you want as long as your cognitive light cone
2217440	2224800	is large enough to encompass many possibly all beings and then it's fine.
2225520	2230960	And so there's this issue and this is something that Bill and our other collaborators are actually
2230960	2237680	working on this notion of increasing the cone of compassion outwards. So the interesting thing
2237680	2242720	about us engineering all this is that we are not the only bioengineers. This is another,
2242720	2248960	this is a non human bioengineer. And look, this is a this is an oak leaf. And you might think that
2248960	2253920	well, acorns always make oak trees and these leaves, we know what the oak genome does, right?
2253920	2258800	It makes these flat green things. But but here comes this bioengineer doesn't change the genome,
2258800	2264400	the hardware is perfectly capable. You don't need to rewire it. I don't have to explain to this crowd
2264400	2268480	why, you know, you don't use a soldering iron when you want to go from PowerPoint to Microsoft
2268480	2273600	Word on your laptop. This this this this animal takes advantage of exactly that,
2273600	2278480	which is that it lays down some signals that prompt the cells to build something completely
2278480	2283760	different. This is made of the of the plant cells, not the not the not the animal. Would we have any
2283760	2287920	idea that these cells are capable of building something like this or like this, right? If we
2287920	2293440	hadn't done this, we would not. And so for that reason, in our lab, we make a number of synthetic
2293440	2300480	creatures to really test the plasticity, the the the ability of these of the hardware to undergo
2300480	2308080	novel novel scenarios. And this is we call these xenobots, because what what happens here is that
2308080	2313600	some some skin cells are harvested from the top of a frog embryo. They self assemble into this
2313600	2317840	little thing, which I think is a biorebotics platform. And we are interested in knowing where
2317840	2323280	their goals come from. So here you can see they swim. They can go in circles, they can patrol back
2323280	2329040	and forth, they have collective behaviors. Here's one going through through a maze. So it comes down
2329040	2333280	this this arm of the maze over here, it's going to take a turn without bumping into the opposite
2333280	2339040	wall. So it takes a turn. And at this point, due to some internal mech, who knows why it turns around
2339040	2344240	and goes back where it came where it came from. Remember, this is just skin. Okay, there's no
2344240	2348240	there's no nervous system. There's nothing in there. One amazing thing they do is kinematic
2348320	2354720	replication. So if you provide them with loose skin cells, they will run around and combine them
2354720	2359360	into these little these little piles and work them and polish them. And because they're working
2359360	2363760	with an agential material, for the same reason we were able to do this, not because we know how to
2364320	2369680	how to change the way these cells behave, but we liberated them into a new context. And these
2369680	2374160	little piles mature into the next generation of xenobots. And guess what they do? They run around
2374160	2379360	and they make the next generation and the next. This is basically von Neumann's dream of a robot
2379360	2384320	that makes copies of itself from materials it finds in the environment. And so if you ask,
2384320	2389920	what does a frog genome know? Well, it certainly knows how to do this how to make this developmental
2389920	2394160	the hardware that goes through this developmental sequence, and, and then has these these kind
2394160	2399120	of behaviors, there's some tadpoles. But apparently, it also can do this. And the amazing thing is that
2399120	2403600	there's never been any xenobots, there's never been any evolutionary pressure to be a good xenobot,
2403600	2407840	where did all this come from? Why is there this weird developmental stage of this xenobot? This is
2407840	2414000	an 80 year old, 80 day old xenobot, it's changing into something, we have no idea what, they have
2414000	2417920	their own behaviors, they do this kinematic replication that no one else, as far as we know,
2417920	2425040	no other organism does. So, so this is really the thing when you make, or when you facilitate
2425040	2429920	novel collective intelligences that have never been here before. And that includes financial
2429920	2434560	structures, social structures, internet of things, who knows, we make these things all the time.
2435120	2439600	We really don't know where, where their goals come from, what their goals are going to be,
2439600	2444080	what their capacity for problem solving is going to be, we need to understand.
2444080	2448640	And lest you think that this is some special, I mean, these these cells come from an amphibian,
2448640	2452240	they come from an embryo, you might think amphibians are plastic, embryos are pretty
2452240	2458480	plastic, this is probably some some crazy embryonic cell thing. Well, here is this little creature,
2458560	2462480	if I asked you what you thought this was, you might think we got it off the bottom of a pond
2462480	2468800	somewhere. If you were to sequence its genome, you would see 100% Homo sapiens. This is, these
2468800	2473280	are human cells, they come from an adult human patient, no embryo stuff, adult human tracheal
2473280	2480240	epithelial cells, they make something we call anthrobots. We, this is a type of agential intervention,
2480240	2488240	because these anthrobots, remarkably, we found a novel capability. The capability is, and I'm
2488240	2491280	sure there are many others, is just the first thing we found, is that if you played a bunch of
2491280	2496960	human neurons and you scratch them, so you make a wound right here, these anthrobots will traverse
2496960	2502560	down the wound. And when they settle down, what they'll do is they start knitting the two sides
2502560	2509760	together, they heal this this this neural defect. And so who would have known that your tracheal
2509760	2515200	cells, which sit there quietly in your airway for decades, if you take them out and you let them
2515200	2519040	have a new life, reboot their multicellularity, have a new life in the new environment,
2519040	2524000	they become this little motile creature that can run around, by the way, can be injected back into
2524000	2528240	your body. There's no immune suppression needed because it's your own cells. It shares all the
2528240	2532880	priors with your own tissues about what health and disease are, what cancer is, what inflammation is.
2532880	2537360	And among other things, what they can do is they can actually repair neural defects.
2537360	2540800	And so, so that's just kind of the biomedical side of things, but, but more fundamentally,
2540800	2543440	and I'm just about done, I know I'm over time a couple minutes.
2545840	2550640	Just fundamentally, what we see is that what I think these are, and this is not a,
2550640	2554720	this is not the conventional, you know, view of my colleagues, I don't think, but, but what I think
2554720	2560960	we're looking at in all of these examples is vehicles for exploring a platonic space or a
2560960	2566160	latent space of possibilities. When we ask where do the shape and behavior of xenobots,
2566160	2570640	of anthrobots, of other chimeras, and of the weird things that we make, where do they come from?
2570640	2576000	Well, evolutionary selection is not where they come from. And I think that what normal embryos do
2576000	2581920	is exploit a little pinprick, a one single point of interface between this platonic space and the
2581920	2588240	physical world, and you get your standard reliable body. But, but what we can do is we can start to
2588240	2593840	enlarge these little holes by making anthrobots and xenobots and other things. We can start making
2593840	2599520	holes and, and looking around and starting to understand the structure of that space. What
2599520	2604240	else is out there? I, I really think that what we're studying here is, is the structure of this,
2604240	2609360	of this space that's around us and still very poorly understood. So just, just a couple things
2609360	2614960	to, to finish up here. First of all, here's what I think the biology teaches us. Everything is going
2614960	2618880	to change. Your body is going to change, your parts, the environment, everything is going to change.
2618880	2625520	It's futile to try to hold on to specific details. And in particular, biology uses an extremely
2625520	2632720	unreliable material. Everything is within, within a cell is going to go bad. There's, there's huge
2632720	2636960	amounts of noise. It's, it's exactly the opposite of what we do in computers, where we make very
2636960	2641840	reliable parts and we try to insulate each level from the level below. You don't, you know, you,
2641840	2645360	you just sort of assume the level below is going to work. And then, and then that's how we program.
2645440	2649600	That is the opposite of what biology does. Biology assumes the material is going to go
2649600	2655120	wrong in a million ways. Whether you're a genome, whether you're, you're a genome that has to be
2655120	2659440	reinterpreted by the species as it changes, you know, your parts are going to change. You're going
2659440	2663840	to be mutated and your environment will change. You have to reinterpret it. Brains do the same
2664400	2669440	as they change over time. They reinterpret their memories. Intelligence is everywhere.
2669440	2674720	That's because the only way to do this kind of, this kind of thing, this committing to salience
2674720	2680400	as opposed to accuracy means that intelligence has to be everywhere. Every part of the body has
2680400	2686960	to be able to reinterpret, confabulate, tell stories, new stories about what it saw and,
2686960	2692960	and what information it has to solve whatever the, the new problems are. This is polycomputing,
2692960	2701520	which, which Josh Barnagar and I work out, work on the idea that biology has is, is just a
2702160	2706880	huge collection of systems which interpret and reinterpret each other's computations in different
2706880	2712320	ways. The exact same computation means different things to different observers. So it's an observer
2713040	2718240	focused view. You can't say, what is it really computing? And from that perspective, each self
2718240	2723920	is a, is a dynamic construction. It's an ongoing process of sense making of your own memories and
2723920	2729920	the environment and it's self reinforcing. These are, these are, these are basically
2730080	2736400	points of view. These are self reinforcing, continuously modifying points of view that seek
2736400	2740880	to perpetuate themselves by making sense of whatever's going on now. And this is, this is a
2740880	2746240	very deep idea from William James where he said, thoughts are the thinkers. If we sort of dissolve
2746240	2751760	the idea of the distinction between data and machine, right? And we, and we think that the
2751760	2758000	pattern itself is actually helping construct its niche. So it's constructing the cognitive system
2758000	2764240	within which it will prosper. Then, then all of us are really very complex bundles of, of thoughts
2764240	2770960	that have sort of closed the loop and learn to contribute to their own persistence within various
2770960	2777360	physical cognitive systems. And because biology is so interoperable, because biology solves all
2777360	2782880	of this on the fly, it doesn't, doesn't assume anything. Pretty much any combination of evolved
2782880	2789120	material, designed or engineered material and software is some kind of viable agent. So we
2789120	2793360	already have some cyborgs and we're going to have lots more in there, hybrids and chimeres and
2793360	2799600	all kinds of just different bodies and minds where all of Darwin's endless forms, most beautiful
2799600	2806320	on earth are a tiny little dot in this enormous option space of new bodies and new minds. So,
2806320	2813120	so these, so the need now for a new ethical synthbiosis is clear. This, this old idea that we
2813120	2817440	can decide how we're going to relate to something based on what does it look like and how did it
2817440	2822400	get here? Did it come from a factory or was it naturally evolved by the random processes of
2822400	2827120	evolution? Those two criteria are going to be out the window. We're going to have to deal with
2827120	2833120	beings that are nowhere on the tree of life with us that don't offer us easy answers the way that
2833200	2837440	for example, current AIs do when, you know, you can, you can kind of distinguish them
2837440	2842560	strongly from, from biology, but, but boy, we're going to be surrounded by, by beings that are
2842560	2849920	composites and none of those answers will be so, so trivial. And this is Jeremy Gay. He's an amazing
2849920	2854640	graphic artist who drew this for me. This is kind of a new version of Adam and the, and the Garden
2854640	2858880	of Eden because we've got our job cut out for us, but it's, it's going to be an amazing journey
2858880	2865360	because we are finally going to, I hope, get better at detecting and, and relating to very
2865360	2869920	diverse minds all around us. So I'm going to stop here. If you're interested in any of this stuff,
2869920	2877120	it's discussed in various papers here. These are the people I want to thank, a number of postdocs
2877120	2883680	and PhD students that did the work that I showed you today. Lots of our collaborators. These are
2883680	2887760	the, the people who fund us on disclosures. So these are three spin-off companies for my group
2887760	2892960	that have funded our work and most thanks of all to the actual animals that we deal with.
2892960	2898880	So yeah, that's it. Thank you so much for listening.
