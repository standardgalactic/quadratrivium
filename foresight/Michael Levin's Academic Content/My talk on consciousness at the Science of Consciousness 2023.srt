1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
Thank you so much.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,280
Thank you for having me here.

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,240
It's a huge, huge pleasure to be able to share some ideas

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,400
with you all.

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,440
I've never been to this conference before

6
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,240
and I'm very gonna really enjoy saying some things

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,240
that are actually fairly, let's say not as radical

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,700
as some other things that probably people have said.

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,840
So that's a new experience for me.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,640
And so if anybody's interested in the kinds of things I do,

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,160
you can find all of that here.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,760
I want to say right up front to set expectations.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,560
I don't particularly work on consciousness per se.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,200
I work on cognition, agency, intelligence, things like that.

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,000
And I do think they have implications

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,720
and so I will kind of go out on the ledge here today.

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,160
But I'm gonna make a fairly modest claim.

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,360
I'm not going to try to produce a new theory

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,440
of consciousness, I'm not going to try to support

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,920
one specific theory of consciousness with data.

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,960
Here's what I'm going to try to do.

22
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,360
I'm gonna try to make a fairly simple argument

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,080
that if we use composition and behavior

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,680
as evidence of consciousness in other systems

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,920
when addressing the problem of other minds,

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,160
that is if our criteria include things like

27
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,080
what are you made of, what are your behavioral competencies

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,200
and so on, if that's how we address it,

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,960
then for the exact same reasons

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,000
that we tend to associate consciousness

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,760
with complex brains, we need to take very seriously

32
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,120
the possibility of consciousness in many body structures.

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,600
That's a very controversial claim in some audiences,

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,240
maybe it won't be particularly controversial here.

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,920
But what I'd really like to do is to widen

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,200
the set of systems about which we think

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,840
when we think about consciousness and related issues

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,840
beyond human brains, when we talk about AI,

39
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,360
I don't want to think specifically

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,160
about just is it human-like

41
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,480
because it's actually much more interesting than that.

42
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,000
So one of the key things is that I think

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,400
we have to move beyond these kind of conventional

44
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,040
intelligences, there's a famous painting of Adam

45
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,040
naming the animals in the Garden of Eden

46
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,680
and if you think that there are these

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,720
very sort of discreet natural kinds,

48
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,560
then one can have these binary categories

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,400
of which things do and do not have consciousness.

50
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,840
People are pretty sure about Adam,

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,240
not so sure about some of the stuff

52
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,160
that's not shown here, paramecia, slime molds,

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,180
they are various other things.

54
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,980
So the reason that we have to think about these things

55
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,020
is that the standard human,

56
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,780
which features prominently in philosophical accounts

57
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,220
of consciousness and so on,

58
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,220
is really just one point on two continua

59
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,340
or four, depending on how you want to count.

60
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,180
But this kind of conscious or agential glow is,

61
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,220
you have to sort of decide what happens to it

62
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,860
as you walk backwards from a modern adult human

63
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,900
all the way back to the oocyte that all of us once were.

64
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,540
You can also walk it back on an evolutionary timescale

65
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,620
and ask what happens all the way back

66
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,900
because all of these things are smooth and continuous.

67
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,780
And in fact, with modern bioengineering

68
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,140
and synthetic biology, it's now very clear

69
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,740
that both using biological means

70
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,940
and sort of hybrid technological means,

71
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,660
we can create hybrids and chimeras in every possible way

72
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,140
and really extend the typical embodiment

73
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,500
in very diverse directions.

74
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,180
And so we'll get back to this more towards the end of the talk.

75
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,340
And so what I've been working on is a framework,

76
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,860
which I call TAME,

77
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,180
or stands for technological approach for mind everywhere.

78
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,380
And the idea is to be able to recognize, create,

79
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,700
and ethically relate to truly diverse intelligences.

80
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,300
So regardless of composition,

81
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,740
meaning what you're made of or origin story,

82
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,300
meaning whether you were produced the natural way

83
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,500
or engineered or some combination thereof.

84
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,100
And I want to be able to handle all of these kinds of things.

85
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,340
And the familiar creatures, all kinds of weird colonial

86
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,300
and synthetic organisms,

87
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,740
AIs, whether software or hardware,

88
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,140
and potentially exobiological agents.

89
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,420
And so of course, people have tried before for these kinds of,

90
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,340
so this is a Rosenbluth et al from the 1940s,

91
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,780
trying for a scale of these kinds of things

92
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,340
that are not particularly bound to embodiments,

93
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,700
let's say brains and things like that,

94
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,140
very kind of cybernetic definition.

95
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,220
And I've been working on a model that has to do

96
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,300
with what I call a cognitive light cone,

97
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,980
which is this idea that all agents have one thing in common,

98
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,060
no matter what they're made of or how they got here,

99
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,940
which is the ability to pursue certain goals

100
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,620
in certain spaces and the size of those goals,

101
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,180
the literal spatial temporal size of the largest goal

102
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,500
that an agent can pursue,

103
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,100
is one way that we can classify

104
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,180
and compare very diverse intelligences.

105
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,220
And the critical thing is that,

106
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,740
as I'm primarily a developmental biologist,

107
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,340
the thing that always just astounds me

108
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,220
is that all of us were once,

109
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,460
what people call, quote unquote, just physics.

110
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,260
We were all a quiescent oocyte, a little blob of chemicals,

111
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,940
and slowly, gradually, without any magical lightning flash

112
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,260
that comes in at any particular point during development,

113
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,860
we become one of these things,

114
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,660
or perhaps even something like this

115
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,500
that can reason back and make comments

116
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,260
about not being a machine

117
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,140
or being more than physics and something like that.

118
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,660
So this process is very slow and gradual,

119
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,260
and what we're interested in

120
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,500
is that process and the scaling of competencies

121
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,740
of very simple, minimal matter,

122
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,980
chemical signals, systems and cells and tissues,

123
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,980
the scaling up of the tiny little goals of single cells,

124
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,980
so metabolic and transcriptional goals

125
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,020
and things like this,

126
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,500
into collective systems that have very large goals,

127
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,260
I'll talk about this momentarily,

128
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,260
and the kinds of failure modes that the system has,

129
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,060
which is a breakdown of that collectivity into cancer,

130
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,820
back down to cells that have little tiny goals

131
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,380
about proliferation and migration,

132
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,220
and that's it,

133
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,660
and they no longer care about the rest of the system.

134
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,100
So the meat of our research program

135
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,140
has to do with understanding the scaling,

136
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,780
understanding that cognitive light cone

137
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,660
and how it actually scales up from that of a single cell,

138
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,260
and in fact, below that in some other work

139
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,340
that we've done with Chris Fields and Carl Friston,

140
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,540
and up, up and up.

141
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,820
And one of the things that happens in development,

142
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,260
which is kind of interesting,

143
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,900
is the auto-poeses or self-construction

144
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,580
of a single individual from a kind of a pool of potentiality,

145
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,980
and it looks like this,

146
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,420
this is an early blastoderm,

147
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,880
let's say of a human or a chicken or many other animals.

148
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,220
We see, let's say 50,000 cells,

149
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,020
and we say there's an embryo.

150
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,060
What are we counting when we say that's one embryo?

151
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,020
I mean, there really isn't one of anything physical,

152
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,340
there are many, many cells.

153
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,460
What is there one of?

154
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,520
And this is gonna become an individual.

155
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,400
Well, what there's one of is alignment,

156
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,400
both physical alignment and kind of functional alignment

157
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,760
towards a particular goal.

158
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,560
That alignment is the creation of a particular target

159
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,920
morphology, a particular anatomical structure.

160
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,080
As I'll show you momentarily, if you try to deviate it,

161
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,520
it will find new ways to get there.

162
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,760
So it's definitely this kind of homeostatic system.

163
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,120
But there doesn't have to be just one.

164
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,920
And if you make temporary scratches in this blastoderm,

165
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,320
what you end up with, each of these regions

166
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,520
not being able to feel the other self-organizes

167
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,360
into an embryo.

168
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,160
And eventually you end up with twins, triplets,

169
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,920
and many other cells.

170
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,600
So the question of how many individuals are in an embryo

171
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
is actually not clear.

172
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,040
It's not set up by the genetics,

173
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,320
it's a physiological self-organizational process.

174
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,640
And what it means is that each one of these individuals

175
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,240
has to, on the fly, every single time

176
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,180
that they arise in this physical world,

177
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,020
they have to solve this important problem.

178
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,420
Where do I end, and where does the environment begin?

179
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,260
Every cell is some other cell's environment.

180
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,180
How do these cells know what they belong to?

181
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,900
And so as I think Turing actually recognized,

182
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,060
this question of how bodies self-organize

183
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,700
is probably fundamentally the same

184
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,860
as the question of how minds self-organize.

185
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,100
And we see these kinds of dynamics in split-brain patients

186
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,660
and dissociative disorders and so on.

187
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,500
This question of how many individuals

188
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,940
are present within a particular amount of medium

189
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,420
that underlies it.

190
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,260
And so then people who think about these things

191
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,740
often think, well, okay, we have these,

192
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,300
what we call collective intelligences,

193
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,860
colonies of ants and termites and so on.

194
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,300
But at least we are a true unified intelligence, right?

195
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,900
We sort of, many people think that there's

196
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,580
a fundamental difference between these cases.

197
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,940
But of course, and for example,

198
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,580
Descartes really liked the pineal gland

199
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,340
because it's an unpaired structure,

200
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,240
and he felt that was suitable to the unified

201
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,360
human experience.

202
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,200
But if he had had access to good microscopy,

203
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,120
he would have noticed that there isn't one

204
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,560
of anything here either.

205
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,080
This is what the pineal gland tissues look like

206
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,680
inside of each one of these cells.

207
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,840
You get all of this stuff.

208
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,560
So there's an incredible multi-scale organization.

209
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,440
And so the fact of the matter is, I think,

210
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,320
that we are all collective intelligences.

211
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,060
We are made of this kind of agential material.

212
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,520
So this is a lacrimary, it's a single cell.

213
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,160
It has no brain, it has no nervous system.

214
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,280
It's very good at taking care of local goals

215
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,440
in terms of its anatomical structure,

216
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,000
in terms of metabolism and so on.

217
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,760
And when we talk about machines and living organisms

218
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,160
and consciousness, we have to remember

219
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,040
that whatever theories we make,

220
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,960
have to make a ruling on things like this.

221
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,080
What happens here?

222
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,840
I mean, certainly people have a very chemistry-based

223
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,960
views of these things, but this is

224
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,240
what we are actually made of.

225
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,920
We may not feel like a collective of competent,

226
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,760
tiny little cells that are managing perception,

227
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
action, loops towards emergent goals

228
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,640
and weird problem spaces.

229
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,560
But in fact, I think that is exactly

230
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,840
what it feels like to be that kind of a system.

231
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,520
So I think we do, in fact, feel like exactly that.

232
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,160
And so the research program that we and others

233
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,360
are embarked upon is to discover the scaling rules.

234
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,040
How do we go from the individual competencies

235
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,160
of our components to rotating those goals and competencies

236
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,040
into novel spaces?

237
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,360
And so in bodies, not just human, but all bodies,

238
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,480
biology uses this kind of multi-scale competency

239
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,280
architecture, this idea that we are not only nested dolls

240
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,440
structurally, cells, molecular networks,

241
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,040
made of making up cells and tissues and organs and so on.

242
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,800
But actually, each one of these layers

243
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,720
has its own problem-solving capacity.

244
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,160
They are all solving problems in different spaces,

245
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,320
anatomical morpho space, the space of gene expression,

246
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,800
the space of physiological states,

247
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,280
and of course, familiar old three-dimensional behavioral

248
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,960
space.

249
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,480
And so that, I really like William James's definition

250
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,800
of intelligence, which is the ability

251
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,480
to reach the same end by different means

252
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,560
using some degree of sophistication.

253
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,080
So it's very good because it's, again, substrate invariant.

254
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,840
It really talks about the idea of a spectrum of competencies,

255
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,000
and it's kind of agnostic about what space we're working.

256
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,920
And that becomes important because, for example,

257
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,920
in conversations about AIs and other things,

258
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,480
when we say they're not embodied,

259
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,680
I think we really need to expand our understanding of what

260
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,600
spaces we could be embodied in.

261
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,880
And so we and many other animals are

262
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,760
pretty good at recognizing intelligence

263
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,280
in familiar three-dimensional space, so good old behavior.

264
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,600
And this medium-sized objects moving

265
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,760
at medium speeds in three-dimensional space

266
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,640
were kind of familiar with birds and primates

267
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,560
and other things doing that.

268
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,400
But biology does the same thing in other spaces.

269
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,080
So there are transcriptional spaces

270
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,440
where cells are able to solve very interesting problems.

271
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,160
Same thing with physiological space.

272
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,280
I don't have time today, but I could give you

273
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,960
some amazing examples of cells exerting

274
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,480
novel problem-solving behaviors by navigating these spaces.

275
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,040
What I will focus on for a few minutes

276
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,440
is this anatomical morphospace.

277
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,440
So this is basically the space of all possible configurations

278
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,600
of a group of cells.

279
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,680
So Darcy Thompson in the 40s was, I think, the first

280
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,000
to really get an idea of this idea of embryos

281
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,600
and other morphogenetic systems navigating that morphospace.

282
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,240
And I think we really have to get into the idea

283
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,280
that beings can be embodied and can have consciousness

284
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,960
in these other spaces.

285
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,400
I think that while we're very good at this,

286
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,600
if you could imagine if you had an innate, immediate sense

287
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,440
of your blood chemistry, let's say,

288
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,720
I think you would have no problem recognizing

289
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,360
that you live in a higher-dimensional space

290
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,640
and that your liver, your kidneys, and other organs

291
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,480
are, in fact, problem-solving intelligent agents

292
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,480
that are navigating that space exactly the way

293
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,520
you navigate three-dimensional space.

294
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,960
So let's focus on morphospace and talk for a few minutes

295
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,040
about what the competencies are of this.

296
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,400
What we argue is that, actually, morphogenesis

297
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,720
is the behavior of a collective intelligence.

298
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,520
It's the collective intelligence of cells

299
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,080
trying to achieve a particular anatomical structure.

300
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,840
One thing we know is that development

301
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,280
is incredibly robust and reliable,

302
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,560
but it is not hardwired.

303
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,200
So if I cut an early embryo in half,

304
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,720
I don't get two half bodies.

305
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,600
I get two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.

306
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,000
And so there's this notion of different starting states

307
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,400
being able to lead to the same goal state,

308
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,720
this ensemble in morphospace that we equate

309
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,960
to a normal target morphology,

310
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,400
and they can avoid certain local minimum.

311
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,240
Here's an example that we discovered some years ago.

312
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,400
This is a tappel here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain.

313
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,240
And tappels need to become frogs.

314
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,520
And in order to become frogs, they

315
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,080
have to rearrange their face.

316
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,800
So the eyes, the nostrils, everything has to move around.

317
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,240
And so it was thought that this was a hardwired process,

318
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,600
that every organ just moves in the right direction

319
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,800
the right amount.

320
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,640
What we decided to test that and to see

321
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,080
how much intelligence actually is there.

322
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,440
And so we created what we call Picasso tappels.

323
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,520
Everything is scrambled.

324
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,280
The eyes on the back of the head, the jaws are off

325
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,640
to the side, everything is kind of mixed around.

326
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,200
And what we found is that these tappels

327
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,240
become largely normal frogs.

328
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Because in fact, genetics does not specify

329
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,480
hardwired rearrangements.

330
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,840
What it gives you is a problem-solving machine

331
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,040
where every organ now moves in novel, unexpected paths

332
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,200
to get to where it's going.

333
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,680
Sometimes it actually overshoots and has to come back.

334
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,640
But it'll stop when it's done.

335
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,920
So what you really have here is a machine

336
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,040
that can do a kind of error minimization scheme

337
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,400
and start off in different configurations,

338
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,560
but always get to that same place in morphospace.

339
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,200
And this is of course what happens in regeneration.

340
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,840
This guy is an axolotl.

341
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,040
They regenerate their legs, their eyes, their jaws,

342
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,760
and so on.

343
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,920
And you can amputate the limb anywhere.

344
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,120
And these cells will build exactly what's needed

345
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,520
until they get to a correct salamander limb

346
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,720
and then they stop.

347
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,040
This, of course, is the most amazing thing about this.

348
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,680
This process is that it stops.

349
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,560
When does it stop when a correct limb has been formed?

350
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,680
Individual cells don't know anything about what a limb is

351
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,360
or how many fingers you're supposed to have,

352
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,960
but the collective absolutely does.

353
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,440
And it can stop when you get there,

354
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,320
no matter where you started.

355
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,640
It goes beyond this process of problem-solving

356
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,640
goes beyond damage to an existing structure

357
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,320
to what I think of as a good example of really

358
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,760
basal, creative problem-solving.

359
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,240
And it looks like this.

360
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,880
This is a cross-section of a kidney tubule in a nut.

361
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,880
And so usually about eight to 10 cells work together

362
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,160
to create these little tubules.

363
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,920
But if you artificially make the cells very large,

364
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,240
so this is different than damage.

365
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,200
This is not something that normally happens in evolution.

366
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,040
Nuts lose their arms all the time,

367
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,960
but this is quite different.

368
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,640
We've artificially made these cells to be gigantic.

369
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,480
And so what happens is then fewer of them get together

370
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,360
and they make the exact same size lumen.

371
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,680
And the most remarkable thing is that you can make these cells

372
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,320
truly enormous, and the way you do this, by the way,

373
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
is you make them polyploid.

374
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,680
So they have multiple copies of their genetic material,

375
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,600
and so the cells get bigger and bigger.

376
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,480
And in that case, one single cell will wrap around itself

377
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,160
and give you the whole lumen.

378
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,400
What's amazing about this example is a couple of things.

379
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,120
Number one, scaling of number to size,

380
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,800
so you can wrap your head around that.

381
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,280
But what's happening here is a completely different molecular

382
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,960
mechanism.

383
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,600
Instead of cell to cell communication,

384
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,680
you're now using cytoskeletal bending.

385
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,080
So this is a good example of top-down causation,

386
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,600
where in the service of a particular anatomical goal,

387
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,400
different molecular mechanisms will

388
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,600
get called up to solve the problem,

389
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,200
to give you the same outcome.

390
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,480
And the second cool thing about this

391
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,240
is that this is really an example of unreliable hardware.

392
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,680
As an embryo, you can't count on how many

393
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,600
copies of your genetic material you have.

394
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,640
You can't count on what the size of your cells are going to be.

395
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,000
You have to figure out how to get the job done,

396
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,600
despite massive amounts of novelty, injuries, uncertainty,

397
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,640
and your own parts and in the environment.

398
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,360
So this is very basal kind of collective problem solving.

399
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,080
And how does all this happen?

400
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
How can they do this?

401
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,360
And so amazingly, or maybe looking backwards,

402
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,760
not so amazingly, it happens using the same mechanisms

403
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,200
that the nervous system uses to perform these functions.

404
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,800
So I don't have to tell anybody here

405
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,360
what the hardware and software looks like,

406
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,400
but this idea of ion channels setting up various states

407
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,480
that then drive the physiology that

408
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,520
is thought to underlie various aspects of cognition

409
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,960
and consciousness.

410
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,120
And neuroscience has this project of neural decoding,

411
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,280
where we're going to try to read all of these things

412
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,000
and infer what the creature is thinking,

413
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,920
remembering, experiencing, and so on.

414
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,560
So the kind of salient effect here

415
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,840
is that this system did not arise when brains and neurons came

416
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,360
on the scene.

417
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,640
This is evolutionarily ancient.

418
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,640
And even back at the time of bacterial biofilms,

419
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,360
through the work of Goral Sol, we now

420
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,800
know that even back then, already evolution

421
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,120
was using electrically-based computations

422
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,240
to coordinate across space and time

423
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,280
and to drive specific goal states from collective systems.

424
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,600
And so what we've done is now develop

425
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,080
some of the first tools that are able to read and write

426
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,800
this kind of electrical information out

427
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,360
of non-neural tissues.

428
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,520
So we want to do exactly what neuroscientists try

429
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,000
to do in the brain, but we look at other unconventional

430
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,600
intelligences solving problems in anatomical morphospace.

431
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,880
And so this is a voltage map of a time lapse of a frog embryo

432
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,160
organizing its primary axes.

433
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,720
And we can literally, using these voltage-sensitive dyes,

434
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,720
we can see, interpret, and modify

435
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,320
all of the integrated information

436
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,000
and all the communication that goes on

437
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,960
to enable them to reach collective goals.

438
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,160
And so it's a very parallel system, very much the way

439
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,400
that the bioelectrical events in the brain

440
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,640
are controlling muscles to move you

441
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,600
through three-dimensional space.

442
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,680
This more ancient system is using

443
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,280
bioelectrical events elsewhere in the body, right,

444
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,480
from the moment of fertilization to control all of the cells

445
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,840
to move the configuration of the body through morphospace.

446
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,720
It's the same thing.

447
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
And what we think evolution does is basically pivot

448
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,840
the same set of tricks across various spaces.

449
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,560
And so what we can do is we can, of course, we can image this.

450
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,240
And so this is, again, voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes.

451
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,400
This is a video of a frog embryo putting its face together.

452
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,840
And this is one frame.

453
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,680
And long before the genes and the anatomical rearrangements

454
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,840
of the cells begin to form the frog face,

455
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,280
you can already read out this pre-pattern.

456
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,000
Here's you, and I'm showing you this one

457
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,440
because it's the easiest one to decode.

458
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,440
We have others that are a real bear to make sense of.

459
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,840
But this one is pretty obvious.

460
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,080
Here's the animal's right eye.

461
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,760
Here's the mouth.

462
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,840
Here are the placodes.

463
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,080
You can already read the pattern memory in this tissue

464
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,480
that is going to guide the collective activity of the cells

465
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,640
to be able to reach that normal frog target morphology.

466
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,040
And so this is the normal pattern.

467
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,720
This pattern is required for development.

468
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,760
If I perturb this memory, I'll show you in a minute

469
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,360
what you get.

470
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,280
This is a pathological example.

471
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,640
So this is a human oncogene that's

472
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,280
going to basically cause the cells ultimately

473
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,720
to electrically disconnect from their neighbors,

474
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,360
roll back to a unicellular lifestyle,

475
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,160
and their cognitive light cone shrinks

476
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,520
from that of a large organ down to individual cells.

477
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,080
And now, as far as they're concerned,

478
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,200
the rest of the body is just external environment.

479
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,120
They're no longer part of this collective,

480
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,080
and that's tumor genesis and metastasis.

481
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,240
And you can detect this quite readily, this shift.

482
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,360
You can actually see it happening now.

483
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,160
So the way we manipulate these things,

484
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,200
we don't use any kind of electrodes

485
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,040
or applied magnetic fields or anything like that.

486
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,840
We use the native interface that the cells are normally

487
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,160
using to control each other's behavior

488
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,720
and link up into this larger scale intelligence that's

489
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,880
able to move in morphospace and other spaces like that.

490
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,920
So what that means is we can target these gap junctions,

491
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,040
these electrical synapses.

492
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,680
We can control the voltage states directly

493
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,720
using optogenetics, using drugs that

494
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,920
open and close these channels.

495
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,680
We can control the neurotransmitter movement

496
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,080
through these networks.

497
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,680
All the same familiar tools of neuroscience

498
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,760
really do not distinguish between neural tissue

499
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,480
and other tissues.

500
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,200
Everything works.

501
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,000
The tools work, the concepts work.

502
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,880
Everything is readily portable, and so that's what we do.

503
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,120
So I want to show you an example,

504
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,240
and this is just one of many examples of what happens.

505
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,920
I showed you that electric face picture,

506
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,240
and one of the things there was an eye spot.

507
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,200
It was a particular pattern of voltage

508
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,400
that corresponds to an eye.

509
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,720
And we said, what happens if we recreate that same pattern

510
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,200
memory somewhere else in the body?

511
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,280
And so what we did was we injected ion channel RNA

512
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,720
encoding a potassium channel that

513
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,880
sets that particular voltage state.

514
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,600
We encoded it.

515
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,840
We stuck it in some cells that are normally

516
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,280
going to be gut here.

517
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,600
So this is endoderm.

518
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,840
And when you do that, those cells

519
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,560
are happily enough make an eye.

520
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,720
And this eye has all the right lens, and retina,

521
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,640
and optic nerve, and all of that stuff.

522
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,800
Many things we could say about that.

523
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,120
One of the most interesting things about it

524
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,120
is that very much like the kind of scaling

525
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,400
that you see in other collective intelligences,

526
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,000
it has the following property.

527
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,600
This is a lens sitting out in the tail of a tadpole somewhere.

528
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,880
The blue cells are the ones that we actually injected.

529
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,200
But there's not enough of them to make a proper eye.

530
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,080
And they know this.

531
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,960
And what they've done is they've recruited

532
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,200
a bunch of their neighbors, these unmarked,

533
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,520
because they were not directly modified by us,

534
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
cells to participate in this eye building project.

535
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,520
So what's happening here is these are all

536
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,080
native competencies of the tissue.

537
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,040
We didn't have to do size control.

538
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,880
We didn't have to tell them how to build an eye,

539
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,880
what all the different gene expressions and cell types.

540
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
We have to do any of that.

541
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,840
We put in a very simple prompt or stimulus,

542
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,120
build an eye here.

543
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,800
And all the stuff that's downstream of that,

544
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,240
including the way ants recruit their neighbors

545
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,440
when they have a task that's too big for them,

546
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,080
all of that works.

547
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,040
And so we're starting to see some of these properties

548
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,800
and how to interface with them in the body.

549
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,720
And one of the most important things

550
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,600
is the ability to literally rewrite these pattern memories.

551
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,880
So this is a planarian, these flatworms.

552
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,460
The most amazing thing about them

553
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,220
is that you can cut them into pieces.

554
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,900
And if I cut off the head and the tail,

555
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,180
this middle fragment 100% of the time

556
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,580
regenerates into a nice one-headed worm.

557
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,540
So you can ask the question,

558
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,940
how does it know how many heads it's supposed to have?

559
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,140
And if you actually look at the bioelectrical pattern,

560
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,180
you see this interesting pattern that says one head, one tail.

561
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,380
And what we can do now is we can rewrite that pattern.

562
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,220
This is kind of messy.

563
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,340
The technology is still being worked on.

564
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,660
But you can see what we've done is we've said two heads.

565
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,820
And if you cut this animal, now you get a two-headed worm.

566
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,780
And this is not Photoshop.

567
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,340
These are real animals.

568
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,780
Now, notice something very interesting.

569
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,700
This bioelectrical map that is the map of this

570
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,500
perfectly normal anatomical structure, one-headed creature.

571
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,460
The gene expression is in the right place.

572
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,900
The anatomy is in the right place.

573
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,380
What we've changed is the internal representation

574
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,700
of what a correct planarian looks like.

575
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,940
And they stay normal until you injure them.

576
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,340
If you injure them, then all the cells consult this pattern

577
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,820
and they end up building this different pattern.

578
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,180
So that question that I asked at the very beginning,

579
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,940
how do the regenerating cells know what to make?

580
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,460
They literally store a memory of where in morphospace

581
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,540
they're supposed to go.

582
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,260
That memory is rewritable.

583
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,300
And you can think of this as a very primitive precursor

584
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:38,300
to our amazing mental time travel capacities

585
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,780
being able to imagine things that haven't happened yet

586
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,140
and remember things that are not happening now.

587
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,180
Because this bioelectrical pattern

588
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,020
is not a map of this two-headed creature.

589
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,620
This is a map of this perfectly normal one-headed animal.

590
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,540
So a single planarian body is able to store at least

591
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,460
two different representations of what

592
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,180
a correct planarian is supposed to look like.

593
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,660
And I'm sure there's lots more.

594
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,100
But this is the one we've nailed down.

595
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,260
So it's a very primitive example of a counterfactual memory.

596
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,460
What would I build if I were to be cut at a future time?

597
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,860
Not what's going on right now.

598
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,540
What's going on right now is this, one head, one tail.

599
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,700
Now, I keep calling it a memory.

600
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,220
Why is that?

601
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,060
Because it has all the properties of memory.

602
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,660
So if I take these two-headed animals, which, by the way,

603
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,460
are genetically perfectly normal.

604
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,660
So the question of what sets the number of heads

605
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,700
in the planarium is not very simple.

606
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,100
It's not that the answer is non-genetics.

607
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,620
Because if I take this two-headed animal

608
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,700
with a perfectly wild type genome,

609
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,300
I can cut him again and again.

610
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,940
And in perpetuity, he will continue

611
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,020
to regenerate as two-headed forms until we set him back.

612
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,060
We know how to rewrite it back to the one-headed state.

613
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,860
And so this question of how many heads

614
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,020
are supposed to be formed, that memory of where do you

615
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,100
go in morphospace to the one-headed region

616
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,100
or the two-headed region, is stored physiologically,

617
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,940
not genetically.

618
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,580
It is long-term stable.

619
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,700
It is rewritable.

620
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,900
I showed you the latency a minute ago, conditional recall,

621
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,780
and it has discrete behaviors.

622
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,420
And here you can see what these two-headed guys do

623
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,060
in terms of when they're hanging out.

624
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,700
So not only can we control head shape this way

625
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,020
by putting these literally false memories

626
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,260
into this collective agent, we can actually think about,

627
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,460
as well, we can actually think about head shape.

628
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,380
So whereas normally, the species would

629
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,180
make a triangular head shape, if we

630
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,660
perturb the network topology, while it's

631
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,700
regenerating just for 48 hours, they can make these normal heads.

632
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,300
But they can also make round heads like an S-Mediterranean

633
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,900
or flat heads like a Pifelina.

634
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,260
These are other species of planaria.

635
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,860
They are, again, genetically untouched,

636
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,940
but there's about 100 million years of genetic distance

637
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,540
between these animals.

638
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,980
And so this, of course, includes the shape of the brain,

639
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,260
the distribution of stem cells.

640
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,340
They become just like these other animals.

641
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,820
And so the same exact hardware can be pushed

642
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,580
to visit other regions of that morphospace.

643
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,500
This is very much like behavior in three-dimensional space.

644
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,460
The hardware can learn many different things.

645
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,860
It doesn't always do the same thing.

646
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,380
And of course, you can get them to hallucinate

647
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,140
kinds of morphologies that are not even

648
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,020
typical for any species of planaria,

649
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,220
such as the spiky forms, cylindrical forms,

650
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,660
and sort of combinations.

651
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,700
So the exact same hardware can be pushed

652
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,740
into lots of different domains.

653
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,300
And so for the last couple of minutes,

654
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,620
I just want to show you one thing.

655
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,540
We were just talking about this anatomical morphospace

656
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,500
and the different shapes that are there and the species that

657
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,140
naturally know how to get to particular regions

658
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,780
and then how you push other types of implementations

659
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,900
into those regions.

660
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,000
But what does the space of possibilities

661
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,980
look like for totally new beings?

662
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,740
So let's make something that has not existed on Earth

663
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,340
before and see what happens.

664
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,540
So this is a project that we did with Josh Bongard's lab

665
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,620
at the University of Vermont.

666
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,540
And Doug Blackeston did all the biology

667
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,980
that I'm showing you here.

668
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,700
So this is an early frog embryo.

669
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,460
At this stage, we take the animal-cap ectoderm.

670
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,100
This is skin.

671
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
These are all of these cells are going to become skin.

672
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,820
We dissociate them, cut them away from the embryo,

673
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,420
dissociate them, and put them on their own.

674
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
They could do many things.

675
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,340
They could die.

676
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,300
They could spread out.

677
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,060
They could form a two-dimensional monolayer.

678
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,220
They could do nothing.

679
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,820
Instead, what they do is they gather together.

680
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,100
And over the next 24 hours, they're going to come together

681
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,940
and they're going to make this little interesting thing,

682
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,180
which we call a xenobot.

683
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,940
Xenobot because Xenopus laevis is the name of the frog,

684
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,780
and it's a biorebotics platform.

685
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,220
So the interesting thing is that the frog genome certainly

686
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,220
knows how to make this.

687
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,700
This is what we typically see, and this

688
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,060
is what we typically think the frog genome encodes,

689
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,300
a set of developmental stages, and then some behaviors.

690
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,460
But they can also encode this.

691
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,740
This is a xenobot, and it has its own interesting

692
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,060
developmental sequence.

693
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,860
It's never been seen before, and it has interesting behaviors.

694
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,900
What are the behaviors?

695
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,660
Well, the first thing these things do

696
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,020
is they repurpose their little cilia, the little hairs that

697
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,540
normally redistribute mucus down the body of the frog,

698
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,740
and they start to swim.

699
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,940
And they can go in circles.

700
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,140
They can go back and forth like this.

701
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,380
They have collective behaviors.

702
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,020
They have individual behaviors.

703
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,620
Here's one navigating a maze.

704
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,140
So you can see here, remember, there's no nervous system.

705
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,420
This is just skin.

706
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,780
It takes the corner without having

707
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,340
to bump into the opposite wall.

708
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,540
And then here, for no reason that we understand yet,

709
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,300
it has the spontaneous change of heart,

710
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,540
and it turns around and goes back where it comes from.

711
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,380
So these are spontaneously, motile organisms

712
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,700
that have different behaviors.

713
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,540
Here's one amazing behavior.

714
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,860
If you provide them with loose skin cells,

715
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,100
they will run around and collect those skin cells

716
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,380
into little piles.

717
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,220
They will compact them like this.

718
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,660
And because they're dealing with an agential material that

719
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,780
is not passive particles but cells,

720
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,700
these little piles mature into xenobots themselves,

721
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,940
and that's the next generation.

722
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,580
And guess what they do?

723
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,140
They go on and they do the exact same thing,

724
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,140
producing the next generation than the next.

725
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,940
This is called kinematic self-replication.

726
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,260
No other animal on Earth, to our knowledge, does this.

727
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,900
This is completely novel with this kind of construction.

728
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,220
And so they don't have neurons, but they

729
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,340
do have a lot of calcium spiking.

730
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,140
And you can imagine doing all of the things

731
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,260
that neuroscientists do with looking

732
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,900
for transferentropy and mutual information,

733
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,340
all these kinds of things.

734
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,460
So we can ask, what do the cells say to each other?

735
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,860
What do two xenobots say to each other?

736
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,700
We don't know their cognitive capacities.

737
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,900
We're investigating that now.

738
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,700
What can they learn?

739
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,820
What are their preferences?

740
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,380
Really important that we can't make armchair claims about this.

741
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,980
This has to be empirical studies.

742
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,980
So I'm just going to end here with two slides

743
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,860
to say that because biology has to solve all these problems

744
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,060
every time that a being arises into the swirl.

745
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,620
It has to set its boundaries, figure out

746
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,780
what the effectors are, what the sensors are.

747
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,060
And nothing can really be assumed.

748
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,860
It's so interoperable that pretty much

749
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,380
any combination of evolved material at any scale,

750
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,420
designed material, and software, is some kind of agent.

751
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,340
And people are already making cyborgs and hybrids

752
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,740
and every possible combination, which has implications.

753
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,900
We are going to be living in the next few decades

754
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:25,180
in a huge option space of new bodies and new minds.

755
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,420
Darwin said endless forms are the most beautiful

756
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,660
about the natural forms.

757
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,980
They're a tiny corner of this space.

758
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,620
We're going to have to come up with ways

759
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,940
to relate to beings that are nowhere on our tree of life.

760
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,940
So these old criteria of what do you look like

761
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,980
and how did you get here are not going to be useful anymore.

762
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,940
And all of these binary categories

763
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,500
are going to wash away as well.

764
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,420
Because when people make claims about machines and robots

765
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,540
and organisms, it's just very difficult to support

766
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,980
any kind of clean separation.

767
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,740
I'm going to stop here and just summarize what I've

768
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,260
tried to say is that biological systems solve and operate

769
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,780
in all kinds of spaces.

770
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,780
They have behavioral competencies that

771
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,180
include memory and learning and problem solving,

772
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:13,260
navigation, representation, perceptible by stability,

773
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,940
active inference, and so on.

774
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,780
The underlying mechanisms are also the same.

775
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,980
They use ion channels, electrical synapses, neurotransmitters,

776
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,460
microtubules, electric fields.

777
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,740
All of that is present in all of the structures

778
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,100
of bodies.

779
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,580
And if these are the kinds of things

780
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,980
that we think are associated with consciousness,

781
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,620
we have to take very seriously the possibility

782
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,180
that there are other unconventional

783
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,020
consciousnesses in our bodies and increasingly

784
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:40,420
being made by engineering kinds of efforts.

785
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:44,780
And to me, just taking a step back of how

786
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,500
we think about these things, all agency claims

787
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,740
are really protocol claims for how you can optimally relate

788
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,780
to that system.

789
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,260
And so as an engineer, I want to guess correctly

790
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,300
for various systems is where I am on this spectrum.

791
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,220
But of course, it's not just about engineering.

792
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,860
It's also about relationships.

793
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,100
And people are trying to develop sort of proof of humanity

794
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,420
certificates and so on.

795
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,820
And the question then becomes, what do you really

796
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,300
want when you have proof of humanity?

797
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,780
Are you looking for proof of native DNA?

798
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,340
Are you looking for proof of native anatomical structure

799
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,900
or something that we explore here, which is really

800
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,820
a kind of competency for compassion that maybe that's

801
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,900
the more important thing?

802
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,580
And this is an example.

803
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,140
Midjourney is an AI system that I

804
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:29,740
asked to draw its vision of two synthetic organisms in love.

805
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,900
And this is what it drew.

806
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,140
So if anybody's interested, especially these two papers

807
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,660
are relevant, but there's a whole bunch of work on this.

808
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,700
And I want to thank all the people who

809
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,060
did the work that I showed you today

810
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,620
and all our many collaborators, of course, and our funders.

811
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,700
And I thank you for listening.

812
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,820
Thank you.
