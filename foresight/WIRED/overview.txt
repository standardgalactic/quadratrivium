Checking WIRED/16 Levels of Piano Composition： Easy to Complex ｜ WIRED.txt
⁠Nari Sol, as a pianist-composer, has taken on a challenge to explore the complexity of music composition by using the simple melody of "Happy Birthday" as a base. The exploration of complexity in this context is interpreted as the various ways one can manipulate and transform a piece of music. Here's a summary of the stages Nari went through, with an emphasis on the musical and compositional aspects:

1. **Simplest Play**: Started by playing the melody with just one finger in the simplest way possible to establish the baseline.

2. **Adding a Bass Line**: Introduced a bass line with another finger to create a sense of harmony.

3. **Harmonic Support**: Added a third finger to support the bass line, creating chords and exploring harmony further.

4. **Arpeggio**: Broke up the chords into an arpeggio, adding rhythmic complexity.

5. **Rhythmic Variation**: Changed the rhythm from groups of three (common in a waltz) to groups of four and five, adding further rhythmic complexity.

6. **Polyphony**: Introduced multiple voices, creating polyphonic texture where the main melody is accompanied by additional melodies, increasing the complexity through interaction between different parts.

7. **Abstracting the Melody**: Manipulated the melody by playing it backwards, upside down, fragmented, and in different registers, abstracting it to create new material.

8. **Creative Alchemy**: Combined all the previous techniques and levels to create a final piece that reflects Nari's artistic expression, emphasizing that complexity in music is not just about technicality but also about the purpose and emotional connection behind the composition.

Throughout this process, Nari highlighted that complexity in music can be approached from different angles, such as sonority, texture, or architecture, and that the choices made along the way significantly impact the final outcome. The exercise was not just an intellectual challenge but also a reflection of the creative spirit in music composition.

Checking WIRED/Every C-3PO Costume Explained By Anthony Daniels ｜ WIRED.txt
 Anthony Daniels, the actor behind C-3PO in the Star Wars franchise, shared insights into the challenges and processes involved in portraying the iconic character. He discussed the intricate costume design, which for comfort and functionality during scenes required a full body suit with the torso exposed to allow for sitting. The red eyes of 3PO were operated by radio control and could be adjusted for brightness depending on lighting conditions.

Daniels described the technical aspects of performing as 3PO, including the cooling system used during takes to prevent overheating, which involved a bag of ice water circulated by a fan. He also highlighted the importance of stunt performers like his double, Michael Birch, who executed dangerous sequences, such as running at high speeds in the desert, without the safety of ropes due to the potential for accidental ejection from the vehicle.

Daniels emphasized the collaborative effort behind the scenes that contributed to 3PO's performance, including the stunt team, costume designers, and technicians who ensured the character's consistency and believability across all Star Wars films. He expressed gratitude to everyone involved in the creation and maintenance of C-3PO's costume and character, acknowledging their indispensable role in the success of the Star Wars saga.
