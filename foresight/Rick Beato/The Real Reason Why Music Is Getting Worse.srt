00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Hey everybody, I'm Rick Biotto. We're going to try something new today. This video is on the

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:11,840
history of the music business and technology in two acts. Act one. Music is too easy to make.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:20,320
What do I mean by music is too easy to make? Let's just go back to the 1940s and 50s. Frank Sinatra

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,840
used to get up in front of an orchestra and sing a vocal take and they had one microphone

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,080
and they would get it balanced just right. Frank would say, okay, I'm ready to do it and he'd sing.

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,360
Then you get into the 1960s or so and then you have things where you have multi-track machines.

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,000
You could go in if you had a mistake in a vocal part or any instrument and you do a punch in. Oh,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,200
I don't like that word. I sang it out of tune or I want to change this lyric. You go in and you

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,440
just punch in, fix the line, punch out. Fast forward to 1998 with Cher the Believe Son. They

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,120
invented this thing, autotune, that I've talked about this a million times on here, but autotune

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,640
was a plugin that would go into these DAWs, digital audio workstations. So you'd have something like

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,680
Pro Tools or Logic or Ableton. What you do is you take the vocal, let's say the song's in C major.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,280
Any note in the key of C major, it would tune the note too. Well, T-Pain and people like that

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,920
realize if you put it on a really hard tuning, it would make it sound like a keyboard and that's

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,160
what they did in the Believe song. Well, then the same thing starts happening with drum parts.

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,840
Guys play it in drum part and you're like, you know what? This would be a great take of this

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,600
first verse. If this one hi-hat wasn't a little dragged, well, let's move it back a little bit

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,800
or let's move it forward, whatever. And then you move that and you're like, well, the snare after

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,640
it kind of sounds weird because we move that forward. Now the snare sounds like it's dragged,

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,760
so we do that. Then you're like, well, you know what? Let's just look at the grid lines,

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,960
the bar lines, and we'll just move them to that. Then you start cutting out, moving them. Then

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,760
they give you this tool called Beat Detective. Then you can actually quantize an entire part. So then

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,360
it becomes like a drum machine, just not human-like. Here's an example of a quantized drum part,

24
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,320
it's John Bonham's drum performance from Fool in the Rain that's a shuffle. Here's what it sounds

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:11,760
like as a machine. Now, here's the actual human performance of John Bonham. Notice the swing in

26
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:24,160
it. Once you've quantized the drum part, it's a drum machine. It's just like superior drums.

27
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,960
So what started happening in the year 2000 or so is that everyone started quantizing their drums

28
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,400
because the budgets, the higher session guys like Josh Freese and Kenny Aronoff went away

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,480
and you'd have to use the crappy drummers. I mean, some bands would have good enough drummers to play,

30
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,480
but you typically have these crappy drummers that you'd have to fix their parts. And once you fix

31
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,640
their parts, you start moving the bass around, you start moving the guitars around, and then you

32
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,800
pretty much have sterile, generic, quantized rock music that has no vibe at all. The other thing

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,080
that people realize is that it's really difficult and time-consuming to record a drum set. You need

34
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,200
a studio and a lot of gear. Look at all these mics. Now, you can put up three mics and get a drum

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,440
sound. You can put up two mics and get a drum sound. But to get a professional drum sound,

36
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,360
you tend to mic up the different instruments. I got two mics on the bass drum. I got a mic on

37
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,080
this time, mic on that time, mic on the ride, two mics on the overheads, two mics on the snare here.

38
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,080
I actually have three mics on the snare and a mic on the hi-hat. And I have a couple of room mics.

39
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,280
It's hard to record it well. Not only is it hard to play the drums well, but it's hard to record

40
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,680
the drums well and you have to have training. It's not easy to do. You have a great ear. You've

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,360
got to know how to tune them. You've got to know what is a good snare sound from a bad sound.

42
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,960
You've got to know if the toms are ringing too much. You've got to know if they're in the right

43
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,360
pitches, all this kind of stuff. There's so many decisions to make. Now, some of you are out there

44
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,120
thinking, what are you talking about, Rick? You don't need to have a good sounding room. You're

45
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,640
going to have a crappy sounding room. You don't even need good mics because you're going to just

46
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,000
replace everything with samples. Well, where do you think samples come from? They come from people

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,160
that know how to record them. That one was for free. It's difficult to get a good guitar sound.

48
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,840
You have to have a good sounding amp. You have to have good sounding speakers, good microphones that

49
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,960
work well. Most people now just use amp modelers. They plug into their computer. They pull up their

50
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,960
program. Everything is done for them. They've already been pre-miked, pre-selected. They're

51
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,760
all using the same algorithms. They can create great sounds. They're so easy to use. It doesn't

52
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,160
take any skill at all, but it doesn't take any creativity either. Then, of course, you have

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,800
the MIDI packs that you can buy if you can't play keyboards. So, it'll just have pre-program

54
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,920
chord progressions because for some reason, people can't just kind of space their fingers out and learn

55
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,520
to play a few chords like that or maybe just experiment, huh, what is this? What is this?

56
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,400
In the early 2000s, labels stopped signing rock bands, essentially, because it was way too resource

57
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,600
intensive. It was far easier to sign artists that could make their own music using a laptop

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,480
and a microphone. Why is this a bad thing? Well, let's start with the creative dependency on

59
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,760
technology limits the ability of people to innovate, I believe. Could be wrong about that.

60
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,280
Maybe it helps them innovate. I don't think so, though. The homogenization of music, the over-reliance

61
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,200
on similar tools as I just brought up with the amp models, creates a lack of diversity. I think

62
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,200
that leads to music becoming more formulaic and people just following trends of using certain

63
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,640
types of sounds. This is why these trap beats have been in vogue for the last 20 years. People

64
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,160
just, they know they work, so they just keep using them all the time. Quality versus quantity.

65
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,320
This is a big, big thing, okay? So, the easier production makes the process go faster, which

66
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,880
creates an oversaturation of music, making it harder to find really exceptional things.

67
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:52,000
As Ted Joya talks about in this clip. This is Spotify's way of using AI. They have AI songs,

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,560
they attribute them to people that don't exist, and this allows them to take royalties that would

69
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,960
go to musicians and keep them for themselves. On the AI front related to music is too easy to make.

70
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,920
I made a video last week called, I told you this was going to happen, and I played some songs off

71
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:14,800
UDO, and I was saying how my kids could detect that they were AI songs, but other people could not.

72
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Well, it just came out. All three major labels are suing AI startups for copyright infringement.

73
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,200
Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music are suing Suno and UDO for copyright

74
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,560
infringement, because guess what? They're using all their music to train these AI models. Well,

75
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,520
of course they are. How else do they get to train it? No, companies like Universal are not doing it

76
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,000
for the good of their music to protect their copyright owners. What's going on here is they

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,280
just announced that they're partnering with a company called Soundlab to make AI models of

78
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,240
their artists for themselves. They can use this Soundlab plug-in in Pro Tools or Logic, and you

79
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,840
can sing your own voice and replace it with one of their artists like Drake or Taylor Swift

80
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,880
or Billie Eilish or whoever agrees to this, and I guarantee you all these labels are going to do

81
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,720
that because they want to own the AI versions of these songs. Whether you create it or whether they

82
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,080
create it, they're going to own it. And just to show you how easy it is to model someone's voice

83
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,960
with AI, I'm speaking to you through a voice modeling program called 11 Labs that was trained

84
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,760
on my voice over a four-week period. So for those of you that keep writing to me every day, I get

85
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,000
about 20 of these a day, and they always start, Rick, I wrote a song that I think can be a hit.

86
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,360
I used AI to hear it because I know nothing about making music. That's literally from an email I got

87
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,600
yesterday. This reminds me of the best AI critique I've seen. Creative AI tools can be seen as

88
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,480
sophisticated plagiarism software as they do not produce genuinely original content,

89
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:53,200
but rather emulate and modify existing works by artists subtly enough to circumvent copyright

90
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:00,240
laws. Well, what's funny about that is that was actually written by chat GPT. Act two, music is too

91
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:12,800
easy to consume. So this is the water faucet in my kitchen, but imagine this is streaming on Spotify

92
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:21,520
or Apple Music. You can turn it on, you can turn it off, but what's going on in the stream of water

93
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,840
is all of the music that's on these platforms. Now imagine this is one artist's

94
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:36,400
entire output. Their entire catalog might be the police, could be Billy Eilish, could be Led Zeppelin,

95
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:44,240
the Beatles, and then this dropper is each of their songs. One, two, three, four. Oh,

96
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,560
I just did a whole record there, and eventually you exhaust their whole catalog. When I hit this,

97
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,400
and I start the stream, the music has very little importance if you think about it this way.

98
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:05,360
It goes from the faucet down the drain out to the sewer where it's recycled again. Except in this

99
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,440
case, the music is not recycled like it is through the sewer. There were 100,000 new songs added

100
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:19,040
every day in 2023 to streaming platforms. That's more than one song per second for the entire year.

101
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:26,800
By comparison, when I was a kid, if I wanted to buy this Led Zeppelin II record, I had to get a job

102
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,320
or borrow money from my parents to buy it, because I wanted to own it. I wanted it to be in my

103
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,800
collection. This album here, Pat Matheny, New Chautauqua, I paid eight bucks for, brand new,

104
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,960
with the money that I made by bagging groceries at Topps Grocery Store in Fairport, New York.

105
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:52,000
You actually had to expend energy riding your bike or walking to your job, working your shift,

106
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,240
getting your paycheck at the end of the week, depositing it in the bank, getting money out,

107
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,480
going to the record store, buying the record, bringing it home, playing it, listening to it a

108
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,920
bunch of times, going over to your friend's house, sharing it with them. When a kid opens Spotify

109
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,120
and clicks on on a song, they can just skip to the next one if they don't like it. Think about this.

110
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,560
All of the music that exists, or at least has been uploaded to Spotify or Apple Music,

111
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,120
is available for $10.99 a month. I'm talking about all of Michael Jackson's music, all of ACDC,

112
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,400
Pink Floyd, Whitney Houston, Tupac, Kendrick Lamar, Juice World, Eminem, Dr. Dre, all the works of

113
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,640
Beethoven, of Bach, of Mozart, of Stravinsky, of Shostakovich, of Charlie Parker, of John Coltrane,

114
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:44,320
of Miles Davis, Brad Meldow, of Pat Metheny, Keith Jarrett, all of that. $10.99 a month for the price

115
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,680
of what we used to pay for one album. It's all available on these streaming platforms.

116
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:57,040
Which is why music is not as valued by young people. There is no sweat equity put into obtaining it,

117
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,240
having it be part of your collection, having it be part of your identity of who you are. These are

118
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,200
the bands I believe in. These are the artists that I love. And I'm going to share it with my friends.

119
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,360
I'm going to bring that record to school. I'm going to play it for my friends after school. We're all

120
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,040
hanging out reading the back cover of it and seeing who played on it. These things meant something.

121
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:25,280
What was on here meant something produced by John Burns and Genesis. It was important.

122
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,800
What I'm saying is that music is basically become

123
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,640
valueless. If you only have to pay $10.99 a month to have access to anything, what is one song worth?

124
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,480
You know, people tell me that they want me to make certain kinds of videos.

125
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,160
They have these aspirational ideas, as my friend Todd calls them. But then they ultimately vote

126
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,880
with their attention. Rick, make more of what makes a song great videos. Make this kind of video.

127
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,400
Or I wish that people would write songs in odd meters or use these more complex chord changes.

128
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:03,440
But you know, ultimately people will do that and then they don't listen to them because you vote

129
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:12,720
with your attention. So try this. Try to sit down just a couple times a week. Play just a few songs.

130
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,600
Don't look at your phone or as I call it the thought deletion device because it empties

131
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,200
your mind out. Don't look at TikTok. Don't look at YouTube or Twitter. Don't look at Instagram.

132
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,560
Just listen to the music. Let it flow over you. Think about the lyrics. Think about the melody.

133
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,360
And try to experience music like you used to. Or if you're young, try to experience music in the way

134
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,440
that we used to. Love to know your thoughts. Hit the subscribe button. Leave a comment. Thanks for watching.
