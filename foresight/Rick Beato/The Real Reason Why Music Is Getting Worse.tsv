0	3920	Hey everybody, I'm Rick Biotto. We're going to try something new today. This video is on the
3920	11840	history of the music business and technology in two acts. Act one. Music is too easy to make.
13040	20320	What do I mean by music is too easy to make? Let's just go back to the 1940s and 50s. Frank Sinatra
20320	25840	used to get up in front of an orchestra and sing a vocal take and they had one microphone
25840	30080	and they would get it balanced just right. Frank would say, okay, I'm ready to do it and he'd sing.
34080	39360	Then you get into the 1960s or so and then you have things where you have multi-track machines.
39360	44000	You could go in if you had a mistake in a vocal part or any instrument and you do a punch in. Oh,
44000	47200	I don't like that word. I sang it out of tune or I want to change this lyric. You go in and you
47200	53440	just punch in, fix the line, punch out. Fast forward to 1998 with Cher the Believe Son. They
53440	57120	invented this thing, autotune, that I've talked about this a million times on here, but autotune
57120	62640	was a plugin that would go into these DAWs, digital audio workstations. So you'd have something like
62640	67680	Pro Tools or Logic or Ableton. What you do is you take the vocal, let's say the song's in C major.
67680	73280	Any note in the key of C major, it would tune the note too. Well, T-Pain and people like that
73280	77920	realize if you put it on a really hard tuning, it would make it sound like a keyboard and that's
77920	82160	what they did in the Believe song. Well, then the same thing starts happening with drum parts.
82160	85840	Guys play it in drum part and you're like, you know what? This would be a great take of this
85840	89600	first verse. If this one hi-hat wasn't a little dragged, well, let's move it back a little bit
89600	92800	or let's move it forward, whatever. And then you move that and you're like, well, the snare after
92800	96640	it kind of sounds weird because we move that forward. Now the snare sounds like it's dragged,
96640	99760	so we do that. Then you're like, well, you know what? Let's just look at the grid lines,
99760	102960	the bar lines, and we'll just move them to that. Then you start cutting out, moving them. Then
102960	107760	they give you this tool called Beat Detective. Then you can actually quantize an entire part. So then
107760	113360	it becomes like a drum machine, just not human-like. Here's an example of a quantized drum part,
113360	118320	it's John Bonham's drum performance from Fool in the Rain that's a shuffle. Here's what it sounds
118320	131760	like as a machine. Now, here's the actual human performance of John Bonham. Notice the swing in
131760	144160	it. Once you've quantized the drum part, it's a drum machine. It's just like superior drums.
147440	152960	So what started happening in the year 2000 or so is that everyone started quantizing their drums
152960	158400	because the budgets, the higher session guys like Josh Freese and Kenny Aronoff went away
158400	162480	and you'd have to use the crappy drummers. I mean, some bands would have good enough drummers to play,
162480	166480	but you typically have these crappy drummers that you'd have to fix their parts. And once you fix
166480	170640	their parts, you start moving the bass around, you start moving the guitars around, and then you
170640	176800	pretty much have sterile, generic, quantized rock music that has no vibe at all. The other thing
176800	182080	that people realize is that it's really difficult and time-consuming to record a drum set. You need
182080	187200	a studio and a lot of gear. Look at all these mics. Now, you can put up three mics and get a drum
187200	191440	sound. You can put up two mics and get a drum sound. But to get a professional drum sound,
191440	195360	you tend to mic up the different instruments. I got two mics on the bass drum. I got a mic on
195360	200080	this time, mic on that time, mic on the ride, two mics on the overheads, two mics on the snare here.
200080	204080	I actually have three mics on the snare and a mic on the hi-hat. And I have a couple of room mics.
204080	209280	It's hard to record it well. Not only is it hard to play the drums well, but it's hard to record
209280	213680	the drums well and you have to have training. It's not easy to do. You have a great ear. You've
213680	217360	got to know how to tune them. You've got to know what is a good snare sound from a bad sound.
217360	220960	You've got to know if the toms are ringing too much. You've got to know if they're in the right
220960	225360	pitches, all this kind of stuff. There's so many decisions to make. Now, some of you are out there
225360	229120	thinking, what are you talking about, Rick? You don't need to have a good sounding room. You're
229120	232640	going to have a crappy sounding room. You don't even need good mics because you're going to just
232640	238000	replace everything with samples. Well, where do you think samples come from? They come from people
238000	244160	that know how to record them. That one was for free. It's difficult to get a good guitar sound.
244160	247840	You have to have a good sounding amp. You have to have good sounding speakers, good microphones that
247840	252960	work well. Most people now just use amp modelers. They plug into their computer. They pull up their
252960	256960	program. Everything is done for them. They've already been pre-miked, pre-selected. They're
256960	261760	all using the same algorithms. They can create great sounds. They're so easy to use. It doesn't
261760	266160	take any skill at all, but it doesn't take any creativity either. Then, of course, you have
266160	270800	the MIDI packs that you can buy if you can't play keyboards. So, it'll just have pre-program
270800	275920	chord progressions because for some reason, people can't just kind of space their fingers out and learn
275920	281520	to play a few chords like that or maybe just experiment, huh, what is this? What is this?
282160	288400	In the early 2000s, labels stopped signing rock bands, essentially, because it was way too resource
288400	293600	intensive. It was far easier to sign artists that could make their own music using a laptop
293600	298480	and a microphone. Why is this a bad thing? Well, let's start with the creative dependency on
298480	303760	technology limits the ability of people to innovate, I believe. Could be wrong about that.
303760	309280	Maybe it helps them innovate. I don't think so, though. The homogenization of music, the over-reliance
309280	315200	on similar tools as I just brought up with the amp models, creates a lack of diversity. I think
315200	321200	that leads to music becoming more formulaic and people just following trends of using certain
321200	326640	types of sounds. This is why these trap beats have been in vogue for the last 20 years. People
326640	332160	just, they know they work, so they just keep using them all the time. Quality versus quantity.
332160	338320	This is a big, big thing, okay? So, the easier production makes the process go faster, which
338320	344880	creates an oversaturation of music, making it harder to find really exceptional things.
344880	352000	As Ted Joya talks about in this clip. This is Spotify's way of using AI. They have AI songs,
352000	356560	they attribute them to people that don't exist, and this allows them to take royalties that would
356560	362960	go to musicians and keep them for themselves. On the AI front related to music is too easy to make.
362960	367920	I made a video last week called, I told you this was going to happen, and I played some songs off
367920	374800	UDO, and I was saying how my kids could detect that they were AI songs, but other people could not.
374800	380800	Well, it just came out. All three major labels are suing AI startups for copyright infringement.
380800	387200	Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music are suing Suno and UDO for copyright
387200	392560	infringement, because guess what? They're using all their music to train these AI models. Well,
392560	397520	of course they are. How else do they get to train it? No, companies like Universal are not doing it
397520	402000	for the good of their music to protect their copyright owners. What's going on here is they
402000	407280	just announced that they're partnering with a company called Soundlab to make AI models of
407280	414240	their artists for themselves. They can use this Soundlab plug-in in Pro Tools or Logic, and you
414240	419840	can sing your own voice and replace it with one of their artists like Drake or Taylor Swift
419840	424880	or Billie Eilish or whoever agrees to this, and I guarantee you all these labels are going to do
424880	430720	that because they want to own the AI versions of these songs. Whether you create it or whether they
430720	436080	create it, they're going to own it. And just to show you how easy it is to model someone's voice
436080	440960	with AI, I'm speaking to you through a voice modeling program called 11 Labs that was trained
440960	445760	on my voice over a four-week period. So for those of you that keep writing to me every day, I get
445760	450000	about 20 of these a day, and they always start, Rick, I wrote a song that I think can be a hit.
450000	455360	I used AI to hear it because I know nothing about making music. That's literally from an email I got
455360	461600	yesterday. This reminds me of the best AI critique I've seen. Creative AI tools can be seen as
461600	466480	sophisticated plagiarism software as they do not produce genuinely original content,
466480	473200	but rather emulate and modify existing works by artists subtly enough to circumvent copyright
473200	480240	laws. Well, what's funny about that is that was actually written by chat GPT. Act two, music is too
480240	492800	easy to consume. So this is the water faucet in my kitchen, but imagine this is streaming on Spotify
492800	501520	or Apple Music. You can turn it on, you can turn it off, but what's going on in the stream of water
501520	507840	is all of the music that's on these platforms. Now imagine this is one artist's
508720	516400	entire output. Their entire catalog might be the police, could be Billy Eilish, could be Led Zeppelin,
516400	524240	the Beatles, and then this dropper is each of their songs. One, two, three, four. Oh,
524240	530560	I just did a whole record there, and eventually you exhaust their whole catalog. When I hit this,
530560	536400	and I start the stream, the music has very little importance if you think about it this way.
537280	545360	It goes from the faucet down the drain out to the sewer where it's recycled again. Except in this
545360	551440	case, the music is not recycled like it is through the sewer. There were 100,000 new songs added
551440	559040	every day in 2023 to streaming platforms. That's more than one song per second for the entire year.
559040	566800	By comparison, when I was a kid, if I wanted to buy this Led Zeppelin II record, I had to get a job
566800	572320	or borrow money from my parents to buy it, because I wanted to own it. I wanted it to be in my
572320	578800	collection. This album here, Pat Matheny, New Chautauqua, I paid eight bucks for, brand new,
578800	584960	with the money that I made by bagging groceries at Topps Grocery Store in Fairport, New York.
584960	592000	You actually had to expend energy riding your bike or walking to your job, working your shift,
592000	596240	getting your paycheck at the end of the week, depositing it in the bank, getting money out,
596240	600480	going to the record store, buying the record, bringing it home, playing it, listening to it a
600480	605920	bunch of times, going over to your friend's house, sharing it with them. When a kid opens Spotify
605920	611120	and clicks on on a song, they can just skip to the next one if they don't like it. Think about this.
612080	616560	All of the music that exists, or at least has been uploaded to Spotify or Apple Music,
616560	623120	is available for $10.99 a month. I'm talking about all of Michael Jackson's music, all of ACDC,
623120	630400	Pink Floyd, Whitney Houston, Tupac, Kendrick Lamar, Juice World, Eminem, Dr. Dre, all the works of
630400	636640	Beethoven, of Bach, of Mozart, of Stravinsky, of Shostakovich, of Charlie Parker, of John Coltrane,
636640	644320	of Miles Davis, Brad Meldow, of Pat Metheny, Keith Jarrett, all of that. $10.99 a month for the price
644320	649680	of what we used to pay for one album. It's all available on these streaming platforms.
649680	657040	Which is why music is not as valued by young people. There is no sweat equity put into obtaining it,
657040	662240	having it be part of your collection, having it be part of your identity of who you are. These are
662240	667200	the bands I believe in. These are the artists that I love. And I'm going to share it with my friends.
667200	671360	I'm going to bring that record to school. I'm going to play it for my friends after school. We're all
671360	677040	hanging out reading the back cover of it and seeing who played on it. These things meant something.
677760	685280	What was on here meant something produced by John Burns and Genesis. It was important.
685280	688800	What I'm saying is that music is basically become
689360	696640	valueless. If you only have to pay $10.99 a month to have access to anything, what is one song worth?
696640	700480	You know, people tell me that they want me to make certain kinds of videos.
700480	706160	They have these aspirational ideas, as my friend Todd calls them. But then they ultimately vote
706160	710880	with their attention. Rick, make more of what makes a song great videos. Make this kind of video.
710880	716400	Or I wish that people would write songs in odd meters or use these more complex chord changes.
716400	723440	But you know, ultimately people will do that and then they don't listen to them because you vote
723440	732720	with your attention. So try this. Try to sit down just a couple times a week. Play just a few songs.
732720	737600	Don't look at your phone or as I call it the thought deletion device because it empties
737600	743200	your mind out. Don't look at TikTok. Don't look at YouTube or Twitter. Don't look at Instagram.
743200	748560	Just listen to the music. Let it flow over you. Think about the lyrics. Think about the melody.
749120	755360	And try to experience music like you used to. Or if you're young, try to experience music in the way
755360	761440	that we used to. Love to know your thoughts. Hit the subscribe button. Leave a comment. Thanks for watching.
