0	2800	When I say hallucination, you probably think of one or two things.
2800	8700	Psychotropic experimentation, like a dude in a hemp shirt tripping at a fish show watching rainbows melt into puddles.
8700	15600	Or mental illness, like someone doing things because the voices in their head told them to when ending up in the hospital or in jail.
15600	20700	A few centuries ago, most people would have ascribed hallucinations to the influences of ghosts, gods, or witches.
20700	24600	Today, we understand them as the result of neurological disturbances.
24600	31200	And the truth is, hallucinations aren't necessarily a sign of mental illness, drug use, or spirit vengeance.
31200	33900	Rather, they can be caused by lots of different things.
33900	40900	So while not everyone has experienced hallucinations, it's important to understand that everyone is capable of hallucinating under the right circumstances.
40900	45100	In fact, a good number of us will experience some type of hallucination in our lifetime.
45100	45900	I know I have.
45900	52900	Like if you've lost the use of one of your senses, like your sight or smell, but still smell things from time to time, then you've hallucinated.
52900	59400	If you've been under a ton of stress and heard someone tell you what to do only to find that there's no one there, then you've hallucinated.
59400	66300	If you've driven by a bus stop and for a split second saw your deceased father sitting on the bench reading a newspaper, then you've hallucinated.
66300	71800	It's weird, I know, but the one thing I can assure you is that the science behind these phenomena is very real.
71800	82800	INTRO
82800	91000	Whether they're fun, enlightening, confusing, or terrifying, all hallucinations involve sensing things that appear to be real, but actually are product of the mind.
91000	92000	They're not dreams.
92000	93800	You have to be awake to truly hallucinate.
93800	96200	Instead, they're sensory disturbances.
96200	108200	Coming in a variety of flavors, you can see light patterns and objects that aren't there, smell imaginary odors, hear voices and other sounds, or feel physical sensations like crawling skin or your own organs moving.
108200	113200	Even out of body, near death, and sleep paralysis experiences are types of hallucinations.
113200	118700	But to understand what's not real, you first have to understand how your brain judges something to be real in the first place.
118700	122700	This involves the sister processes of sensation and perception.
122700	123700	Two different things.
123700	131200	Your sensory organs receive visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile clues pulled from the outside world in a process called sensation.
131200	138200	That raw data is then sent to the brain, where it's processed, giving it meaning, putting it into context, and the process of perception.
138200	144200	So basically, the brain turns sensory input into meaningful information to create your own model understanding of the world.
144200	149200	The more sensory data you collect, the more they inform that model of how you perceive the world to work.
149200	151700	And most people's models more or less agree on the big stuff.
151700	156200	The sky is blue, the dogs bark, kittens cannot fly, and snow is cold.
156200	164700	But if that normal copacetic brain activity gets disturbed by, say, a dose of LSD, a seizure, a disease, or a megablood of the head, this model can get shaky,
164700	167700	eventually diverging from its normal representation of the world.
167700	173700	Then, suddenly, a flock of kittens fly by in a fiery rose-scented rain while calling your name.
173700	177700	Depending on the type of brain tweak, these hallucinations may take different forms.
177700	184700	Interesting, random, or scary, the good news is they all give us potential to learn about what the heck is going on up here.
184700	188700	Obviously, outside substances can spur some wacky activity in your mind,
188700	194700	and most ancient cultures have some tradition of vision questing aided by some psychotropic substance.
194700	198700	I'm not going to get too into drugs today, but you should understand that different compounds,
198700	203700	whether found in plants, animals, fungus, or synthetically made concoctions, affect the brain very differently,
203700	208700	meaning that even if they all cause hallucinations, they may be using very different pathways.
208700	213700	For example, most researchers agree that LSD garbles the senses in a psycho-biochemical way
213700	217700	by affecting specific feel-good serotonin receptors found in the brain's cerebral cortex
217700	220700	and thalamus regions responsible for sensory perception.
220700	223700	Caffeine, on the other hand, works in an entirely different way.
223700	229700	Australian researchers have linked consuming excessive amounts of coffee with increased risk of auditory hallucinations.
229700	232700	Caffeine sort of gooses the physiological effects of stress,
232700	236700	including the increased production of the body's naturally occurring stress hormone cortisol,
236700	239700	which can lead you to hear things that are not actually there.
239700	244700	But there are many reports of healthy, non-caffeinated people experiencing vivid auditory hallucinations,
244700	246700	often when under extreme stress.
246700	250700	There have been recorded cases of, for example, someone breaking their leg wall alone in the woods
250700	255700	and just wanting to curl up and die, but a strong voice, not just a thought,
255700	261700	but something that seemed actually audible, telling them they need to get up and move to survive.
261700	265700	Grief is its own kind of stress, of course, and hallucinations have been known to occur
265700	268700	in otherwise healthy people during periods of extreme grief.
268700	274700	In fact, people seeing a departed loved one or hearing their voice can be a common part of the grieving process.
274700	277700	But hearing voices is a symptom we typically associate with mental illness,
277700	281700	and while it's true that 70% of Schizophrenics report hearing voices regularly,
281700	283700	it's not necessarily a scary thing.
283700	287700	In fact, one Dutch study found that a good number of mentally stable people
287700	290700	enjoyed hearing pleasant, supportive voices in their heads.
290700	294700	Exactly how a person experiences auditory hallucinations is still fuzzy,
294700	299700	but some neuroimaging studies suggest that it may have to do with the failure of the brain's frontal speech area.
299700	304700	This is the part that usually lets your sensory areas know that the sound they're hearing is self-generated,
304700	306700	like something you're just thinking to yourself.
306700	311700	But if that signal doesn't get sent, then the brain gets confused as to where that voice it's hearing is coming from.
311700	315700	Brain scans have also shown that people with schizophrenia have abnormalities in the areas associated with memory.
315700	322700	That might exacerbate this failure to identify the words that show up in their mind as being part of their own inner monologue.
322700	323700	Here's something interesting, though.
323700	329700	In the total absence of sensation, the brain still leaps to perception, wanting to maintain that connection.
329700	336700	For example, some people who suddenly lose their ability to smell often experience fantasmia, a type of olfactory hallucination.
336700	340700	And yeah, if you smelled wildflowers and baking cookies, it might not be so bad.
340700	346700	But unfortunately, the most common odors are the bad ones, like puke, poop, and rotting stuff.
346700	350700	In these cases, your brain is overcompensating for its lack of olfactory input
350700	355700	by pulling from the memories of old sense and making it seem like you're smelling them for real.
355700	363700	And it's possible that the brain is offering up these disagreeable odors because those very smells had just been suppressed by certain neurons that have since turned off.
363700	365700	And it doesn't just stop with smells.
365700	369700	In fact, one of the most fascinating ways to see visual hallucinations is to go blind.
369700	379700	Charles Bonet Syndrome, or CBS, is a condition that can cause otherwise healthy people with macular degeneration or loss of vision to experience complex visual hallucinations.
379700	390700	The condition was first described by Swiss naturalist Charles Bonet in 1760 after watching his nearly blind grandfather describe seeing visions of birds, buildings, and ladies, among other things.
390700	400700	Patients with CBS report seeing images ranging from simple geometric shapes and colors to vivid, detailed scenes often involving faces and, for some reason, lots of little people.
400700	402700	But these images are not interactive.
402700	410700	The experience is more like watching a movie with the sound off, and what patients see is unrelated to anything they're thinking, feeling, or doing at the time.
410700	412700	And none of the faces are familiar.
412700	417700	Some are pleasing, but others are deformed, and they often have big, misshapen teeth.
417700	426700	These types of hallucinations are very different from psychotic hallucinations, which tend to be interactive and actively address the patient, whether to support, berate, threaten, or jeer at them.
426700	431700	Instead, CBS hallucinations are more like those people with olfactory damage who start to hallucinate smells.
431700	438700	When a person's vision no longer functions, the visual part of their brain can become hyperactive in the absence of stimuli that it was used to.
438700	446700	So it starts firing off images, trying to sort of keep the story going, guessing what it might be seeing if it could still see.
446700	450700	Interestingly, the same phenomenon can be achieved under visual sensory deprivation.
450700	457700	One study blindfolded volunteers for four days, and in the end, ten of the thirteen subjects reported seeing various levels of hallucinations.
457700	466700	Different localized parts of the brain are often involved in specific hallucinations, too, like there's an area for seeing buildings and landscapes, and one just for cartoons.
466700	472700	There's also a region in the temporal lobe called the fusiform gyrus, which is where we process the images of people's faces.
472700	480700	So damage to this area can cause prosopagnosia, or face blindness, the inability to recognize faces, sometimes even your own.
480700	486700	But overactivity in this sliver of the brain can cause a person to hallucinate and start seeing, you guessed it, faces.
486700	497700	Not only that, but the front part of this region specializes in registering teeth and eyes specifically, so it may be involved in the phenomenon of hallucinators seeing faces with crazy big teeth.
497700	509700	So even though you and your brain may sometimes see things a little differently, sometimes a lot differently, you can think of hallucinations as particularly vivid reminders of just how delicate, complicated, and freaking amazing your brain is.
509700	513700	Take care of it, and it will likely do its best to take care of you.
