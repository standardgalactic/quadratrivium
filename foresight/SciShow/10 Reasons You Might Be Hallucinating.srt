1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
When I say hallucination, you probably think of one or two things.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,700
Psychotropic experimentation, like a dude in a hemp shirt tripping at a fish show watching rainbows melt into puddles.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,600
Or mental illness, like someone doing things because the voices in their head told them to when ending up in the hospital or in jail.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,700
A few centuries ago, most people would have ascribed hallucinations to the influences of ghosts, gods, or witches.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,600
Today, we understand them as the result of neurological disturbances.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:31,200
And the truth is, hallucinations aren't necessarily a sign of mental illness, drug use, or spirit vengeance.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,900
Rather, they can be caused by lots of different things.

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:40,900
So while not everyone has experienced hallucinations, it's important to understand that everyone is capable of hallucinating under the right circumstances.

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,100
In fact, a good number of us will experience some type of hallucination in our lifetime.

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,900
I know I have.

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:52,900
Like if you've lost the use of one of your senses, like your sight or smell, but still smell things from time to time, then you've hallucinated.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:59,400
If you've been under a ton of stress and heard someone tell you what to do only to find that there's no one there, then you've hallucinated.

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:06,300
If you've driven by a bus stop and for a split second saw your deceased father sitting on the bench reading a newspaper, then you've hallucinated.

14
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,800
It's weird, I know, but the one thing I can assure you is that the science behind these phenomena is very real.

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:22,800
INTRO

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:31,000
Whether they're fun, enlightening, confusing, or terrifying, all hallucinations involve sensing things that appear to be real, but actually are product of the mind.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They're not dreams.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,800
You have to be awake to truly hallucinate.

19
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,200
Instead, they're sensory disturbances.

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Coming in a variety of flavors, you can see light patterns and objects that aren't there, smell imaginary odors, hear voices and other sounds, or feel physical sensations like crawling skin or your own organs moving.

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Even out of body, near death, and sleep paralysis experiences are types of hallucinations.

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,700
But to understand what's not real, you first have to understand how your brain judges something to be real in the first place.

23
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,700
This involves the sister processes of sensation and perception.

24
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,700
Two different things.

25
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:11,200
Your sensory organs receive visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile clues pulled from the outside world in a process called sensation.

26
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,200
That raw data is then sent to the brain, where it's processed, giving it meaning, putting it into context, and the process of perception.

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,200
So basically, the brain turns sensory input into meaningful information to create your own model understanding of the world.

28
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,200
The more sensory data you collect, the more they inform that model of how you perceive the world to work.

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,700
And most people's models more or less agree on the big stuff.

30
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,200
The sky is blue, the dogs bark, kittens cannot fly, and snow is cold.

31
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:44,700
But if that normal copacetic brain activity gets disturbed by, say, a dose of LSD, a seizure, a disease, or a megablood of the head, this model can get shaky,

32
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,700
eventually diverging from its normal representation of the world.

33
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,700
Then, suddenly, a flock of kittens fly by in a fiery rose-scented rain while calling your name.

34
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,700
Depending on the type of brain tweak, these hallucinations may take different forms.

35
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Interesting, random, or scary, the good news is they all give us potential to learn about what the heck is going on up here.

36
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,700
Obviously, outside substances can spur some wacky activity in your mind,

37
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,700
and most ancient cultures have some tradition of vision questing aided by some psychotropic substance.

38
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,700
I'm not going to get too into drugs today, but you should understand that different compounds,

39
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,700
whether found in plants, animals, fungus, or synthetically made concoctions, affect the brain very differently,

40
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,700
meaning that even if they all cause hallucinations, they may be using very different pathways.

41
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,700
For example, most researchers agree that LSD garbles the senses in a psycho-biochemical way

42
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,700
by affecting specific feel-good serotonin receptors found in the brain's cerebral cortex

43
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,700
and thalamus regions responsible for sensory perception.

44
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,700
Caffeine, on the other hand, works in an entirely different way.

45
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,700
Australian researchers have linked consuming excessive amounts of coffee with increased risk of auditory hallucinations.

46
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,700
Caffeine sort of gooses the physiological effects of stress,

47
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,700
including the increased production of the body's naturally occurring stress hormone cortisol,

48
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,700
which can lead you to hear things that are not actually there.

49
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,700
But there are many reports of healthy, non-caffeinated people experiencing vivid auditory hallucinations,

50
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,700
often when under extreme stress.

51
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,700
There have been recorded cases of, for example, someone breaking their leg wall alone in the woods

52
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,700
and just wanting to curl up and die, but a strong voice, not just a thought,

53
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:21,700
but something that seemed actually audible, telling them they need to get up and move to survive.

54
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,700
Grief is its own kind of stress, of course, and hallucinations have been known to occur

55
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,700
in otherwise healthy people during periods of extreme grief.

56
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,700
In fact, people seeing a departed loved one or hearing their voice can be a common part of the grieving process.

57
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,700
But hearing voices is a symptom we typically associate with mental illness,

58
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,700
and while it's true that 70% of Schizophrenics report hearing voices regularly,

59
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,700
it's not necessarily a scary thing.

60
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,700
In fact, one Dutch study found that a good number of mentally stable people

61
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,700
enjoyed hearing pleasant, supportive voices in their heads.

62
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,700
Exactly how a person experiences auditory hallucinations is still fuzzy,

63
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,700
but some neuroimaging studies suggest that it may have to do with the failure of the brain's frontal speech area.

64
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,700
This is the part that usually lets your sensory areas know that the sound they're hearing is self-generated,

65
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,700
like something you're just thinking to yourself.

66
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,700
But if that signal doesn't get sent, then the brain gets confused as to where that voice it's hearing is coming from.

67
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,700
Brain scans have also shown that people with schizophrenia have abnormalities in the areas associated with memory.

68
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:22,700
That might exacerbate this failure to identify the words that show up in their mind as being part of their own inner monologue.

69
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,700
Here's something interesting, though.

70
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:29,700
In the total absence of sensation, the brain still leaps to perception, wanting to maintain that connection.

71
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:36,700
For example, some people who suddenly lose their ability to smell often experience fantasmia, a type of olfactory hallucination.

72
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,700
And yeah, if you smelled wildflowers and baking cookies, it might not be so bad.

73
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:46,700
But unfortunately, the most common odors are the bad ones, like puke, poop, and rotting stuff.

74
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,700
In these cases, your brain is overcompensating for its lack of olfactory input

75
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,700
by pulling from the memories of old sense and making it seem like you're smelling them for real.

76
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:03,700
And it's possible that the brain is offering up these disagreeable odors because those very smells had just been suppressed by certain neurons that have since turned off.

77
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,700
And it doesn't just stop with smells.

78
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,700
In fact, one of the most fascinating ways to see visual hallucinations is to go blind.

79
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Charles Bonet Syndrome, or CBS, is a condition that can cause otherwise healthy people with macular degeneration or loss of vision to experience complex visual hallucinations.

80
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:30,700
The condition was first described by Swiss naturalist Charles Bonet in 1760 after watching his nearly blind grandfather describe seeing visions of birds, buildings, and ladies, among other things.

81
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Patients with CBS report seeing images ranging from simple geometric shapes and colors to vivid, detailed scenes often involving faces and, for some reason, lots of little people.

82
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
But these images are not interactive.

83
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:50,700
The experience is more like watching a movie with the sound off, and what patients see is unrelated to anything they're thinking, feeling, or doing at the time.

84
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,700
And none of the faces are familiar.

85
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,700
Some are pleasing, but others are deformed, and they often have big, misshapen teeth.

86
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:06,700
These types of hallucinations are very different from psychotic hallucinations, which tend to be interactive and actively address the patient, whether to support, berate, threaten, or jeer at them.

87
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,700
Instead, CBS hallucinations are more like those people with olfactory damage who start to hallucinate smells.

88
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:18,700
When a person's vision no longer functions, the visual part of their brain can become hyperactive in the absence of stimuli that it was used to.

89
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:26,700
So it starts firing off images, trying to sort of keep the story going, guessing what it might be seeing if it could still see.

90
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,700
Interestingly, the same phenomenon can be achieved under visual sensory deprivation.

91
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:37,700
One study blindfolded volunteers for four days, and in the end, ten of the thirteen subjects reported seeing various levels of hallucinations.

92
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:46,700
Different localized parts of the brain are often involved in specific hallucinations, too, like there's an area for seeing buildings and landscapes, and one just for cartoons.

93
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,700
There's also a region in the temporal lobe called the fusiform gyrus, which is where we process the images of people's faces.

94
00:07:52,700 --> 00:08:00,700
So damage to this area can cause prosopagnosia, or face blindness, the inability to recognize faces, sometimes even your own.

95
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:06,700
But overactivity in this sliver of the brain can cause a person to hallucinate and start seeing, you guessed it, faces.

96
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Not only that, but the front part of this region specializes in registering teeth and eyes specifically, so it may be involved in the phenomenon of hallucinators seeing faces with crazy big teeth.

97
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:29,700
So even though you and your brain may sometimes see things a little differently, sometimes a lot differently, you can think of hallucinations as particularly vivid reminders of just how delicate, complicated, and freaking amazing your brain is.

98
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,700
Take care of it, and it will likely do its best to take care of you.
