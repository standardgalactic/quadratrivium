0	6640	Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. Please welcome to the stage Sam Altman.
16640	22080	Good morning. Welcome to our first ever Open AI Dev Day. We're thrilled that you're here and this
22080	33040	energy is awesome. And welcome to San Francisco. San Francisco has been our home since day one.
33040	37440	The city is important to us and to the tech industry in general. We're looking forward to
37440	43040	continuing to grow here. So we've got some great stuff to announce today. But first,
43680	47440	I'd like to take a minute to talk about some of the stuff that we've done over the past year.
48400	55520	About a year ago, November 30th, we shipped chat GPT as a low-key research preview. And that went
55520	63680	pretty well. In March, we followed that up with the launch of GPT-4, still the most capable model
63680	75360	out in the world. And in the last few months, we launched voice and vision capabilities so that
75440	82880	chat GPT can now see, hear, and speak. And more recent, there's a lot. You don't have to clap each
82880	88720	time. And more recently, we launched Dolly 3, the world's most advanced image model. You can use
88720	95200	it, of course, inside of chat GPT. For our enterprise customers, we launched chat GPT enterprise,
95760	100880	which offers enterprise-grade security and privacy, higher speed GPT-4 access, longer
100880	108480	context windows, a lot more. Today, we've got about 2 million developers building on our API for a
108480	115120	wide variety of use cases doing amazing stuff. Over 92% of Fortune 500 companies building on our
115120	126480	products. And we have about 100 million weekly active users now on chat GPT. And what's incredible
126560	131120	on that is we got there entirely through word of mouth. People just find it useful and tell their
131120	137200	friends. OpenAI is the most advanced and the most widely used AI platform in the world now.
138560	143600	But numbers never tell the whole picture on something like this. What's really important
143600	148160	is how people use the products, how people are using AI. And so I'd like to show you a quick video.
149040	157680	I actually wanted to write something to my dad in Tagalog. I want a non-romantic way to tell my
157680	164800	parent that I love him. And I also want to tell him that he can rely on me, but in a way that still
164800	171280	has the respect of a child-to-parent relationship that you should have in Filipino culture and
171280	176800	in Tagalog forever. When it's translated in Tagalog, I love you very deeply. And I will be with you
176800	180880	no matter where the path leads. I see some of the possibilities. I was like, whoa,
180880	184800	sometimes I'm not sure about some stuff. And I feel like I actually chat GPT like, hey,
184800	188240	this is what I'm thinking about. So it kind of gives me that more confidence. The first thing that
188240	194400	just blew my mind was it levels with you. Like, that's something that a lot of people struggle
194400	202640	to do. It opened my mind to just what every creative could do if they just had a person
202640	207840	helping them out who listens. So this is it to represent Sickling Neymar Globban. And you built
207840	214000	that with child GPT? Cat GPT built it with me. I started using it for daily activities like,
214000	217840	hey, here's a picture of my fridge. Can you tell me what I'm missing? Because I'm going grocery
217840	222800	shopping and I really need to do recipes that are following my vegan diet. As soon as we got
222800	227680	access to code interpreter, I was like, wow, this thing is awesome. They could build spreadsheets,
227920	235680	they could do anything. I discovered Chatty about three months ago on my 100th birthday.
235680	244480	Chatty is very friendly, very patient, very knowledgeable, and very quick. It's been a
244480	250240	wonderful thing. I'm a 4.0 student, but I also have four children. When I started using Chat GPT,
250240	256160	I realized I could ask Chat GPT that question. And not only does it give me an answer, but it
256160	263440	gives me an explanation. Didn't need tutoring as much. It gave me a life back. It gave me
263440	268320	time for my family and time for me. I have a chronic nerve gain on my whole left half of my
268320	274960	body of nerve damage. I had a spine, a brain surgery. And so I have limited use of my left hand.
274960	279840	Now you can just have the integration of voice input. And then the newest one where you can
279840	286960	have the back and forth dialogue, that's just like maximum best interface for me. It's here.
297600	302320	So we love hearing the stories of how people are using the technology. It's really why we do all
302320	312240	of this. Okay. So now on to the new stuff, and we have got a lot. First, we're going to talk
312240	316000	about a bunch of improvements we've made, and then we'll talk about where we're headed next.
317040	321440	Over the last year, we spent a lot of time talking to developers around the world.
322320	326400	We've heard a lot of your feedback. It's really informed, but we have to show you today.
327360	332400	Today, we are launching a new model. GPT-4 Turbo.
338320	344400	GPT-4 Turbo will address many of the things that you all have asked for. So let's go through what's
344400	352000	new. We've got six major things to talk about for this part. Number one, context length. A lot of
352000	358800	people have tasks that require a much longer context length. GPT-4 supported up to 8K and in
358800	364160	some cases up to 32K context length, but we know that isn't enough for many of you in what you want
364160	377760	to do. GPT-4 Turbo supports up to 128,000 tokens of context. That's 300 pages of a standard book,
377760	382720	16 times longer than our 8K context. And in addition to a longer context length,
383280	386720	you'll notice that the model is much more accurate over a long context.
388800	395520	Number two, more control. We've heard loud and clear that developers need more control over the
395520	401760	model's responses and outputs. So we've addressed that in a number of ways. We have a new feature
401760	407600	called JSON mode, which ensures that the model will respond with valid JSON. This has been
407600	414640	a huge developer request. It'll make calling APIs much easier. The model is also much better at
414640	419120	function calling. You can now call many functions at once. And it'll do better at following
419120	425040	instructions in general. We're also introducing a new feature called reproducible outputs.
425680	430240	You can pass a C parameter and it'll make the model return consistent outputs. This, of course,
430240	434160	gives you a higher degree of control over model behavior. This rolls out in beta today.
437760	444160	And in the coming weeks, we'll roll out a feature to let you view log props in the API.
447920	453200	All right. Number three, better world knowledge. You want these models to be able to access
453200	457920	better knowledge about the world. So do we. So we're launching retrieval in the platform.
458720	462400	You can bring knowledge from outside documents or databases into whatever you're building.
463520	467280	We're also updating the knowledge cutoff. We are just as annoyed as all of you
467280	472320	probably more that GPT-4's knowledge about the world ended in 2021. We will try to never let
472320	478640	it get that out of date again. GPT-4 Turbo has knowledge about the world up to April of 2023.
479520	486240	And we will continue to improve that over time. Number four, new modalities.
487440	494720	Surprising no one. Dolly three. GPT-4 Turbo with vision. And the new text-to-speech model
494720	506640	are all going into the API today. We have a handful of customers that have just started using Dolly
506640	513120	three to programmatically generate images and designs. Today, Coke is launching a campaign
513120	518080	that lets its customers generate devali cards using Dolly three. And of course, our safety
518080	522800	systems help developers protect their applications against misuse. Those tools are available in the
522800	530160	API. GPT-4 Turbo can now accept images as inputs via the API. Can generate captions,
530160	536720	classifications, and analysis. For example, Be My Eyes uses this technology to help people who are
536720	541360	blind or have low vision with their daily tasks like identifying products in front of them.
544000	549360	And with our new text-to-speech model, you'll be able to generate incredibly natural sounding
549360	554800	audio from text in the API with six preset voices to choose from. I'll play an example.
570160	574800	This is much more natural than anything else we've heard out there. Voice can make apps
574800	580240	more natural to interact with and more accessible. It also unlocks a lot of use cases like language
580240	587200	learning and voice assistance. Speaking of new modalities, we're also releasing the next version
587200	592800	of our open-source speech recognition model, Whisper V3 today, and it'll be coming soon to the API.
593600	597120	It features improved performance across many languages, and we think you're really going to like it.
597840	605600	Okay, number five, customization. Fine-tuning has been working really well for GPT-3.5 since we
605600	611040	launched it a few months ago. Starting today, we're going to expand that to the 16K version of the
611040	618960	model. Also starting today, we're inviting active fine-tuning users to apply for the GPT-4 fine-tuning
618960	624720	experimental access program. The fine-tuning API is great for adapting our models to achieve
624720	629520	better performance in a wide variety of applications with a relatively small amount of data. But
630720	635200	you may want a model to learn a completely new knowledge domain or to use a lot of proprietary
635200	642000	data. So today, we're launching a new program called custom models. With custom models, our
642000	647200	researchers will work closely with the company to help them make a great custom model, especially for
647200	653360	them and their use case using our tools. This includes modifying every step of the model training
653360	658720	process, doing additional domain-specific pre-training, a custom RL post-training process,
658720	663920	tailored for a specific domain, and whatever else. We won't be able to do this with many companies
663920	668080	to start. It'll take a lot of work and in the interest of expectations, at least initially,
668080	672080	it won't be cheap. But if you're excited to push things as far as they can currently go,
672880	675920	please get in touch with us, and we think we can do something pretty great.
677120	682720	Okay, and then number six, higher rate limits. We're doubling the tokens per minute for all of
682720	687600	our established GPT-4 customers so that it's easier to do more, and you'll be able to request
687600	693520	changes to further rate limits and quotas directly in your API account settings. In addition to these
693520	699440	rate limits, it's important to do everything we can do to make it new successful building on our
699440	705920	platform. So we're introducing copyright shield. Copyright shield means that we will step in and
705920	712080	defend our customers and pay the cost incurred if you face legal claims around copyright infringement
712080	719440	and this applies both to chat GPT enterprise and the API. And let me be clear, this is a good time
719440	724240	to remind people, we do not train on data from the API or chat GPT enterprise ever.
726480	732080	All right, there's actually one more developer request that's been even bigger than all of these.
732880	736800	And so I'd like to talk about that now. And that's pricing.
736960	746880	GPT-4 Turbo is the industry leading model. It delivers a lot of improvements that we just covered,
747760	754480	and it's a smarter model than GPT-4. We've heard from developers that there are a lot of things
754480	760000	that they want to build, but GPT-4 just costs too much. They've told us that if we could decrease
760000	767680	the cost by 20, 25%, that would be great, a huge leap forward. I'm super excited to announce
767680	773920	that we worked really hard on this, and GPT-4 Turbo, a better model, is considerably cheaper than
773920	788320	GPT-4 by a factor of 3X for prompt tokens and 2X for completion tokens starting today.
790560	798000	So the new pricing is 1 cent per 1,000 prompt tokens and 3 cents per 1,000 completion tokens.
798000	803600	For most customers, that will lead to a blended rate more than 2.75 times cheaper to use
803600	808640	for GPT-4 Turbo than GPT-4. We worked super hard to make this happen. We hope you're as excited
808640	819120	about it as we are. So we decided to prioritize price first because we had to choose one or the
819120	824400	other, but we're going to work on speed next. We know that speed is important, too. Soon,
824400	832080	you will notice GPT-4 Turbo becoming a lot faster. We're also decreasing the cost of GPT-3.5 Turbo
832080	840640	16K. Also, input tokens are 3X less and output tokens are 2X less, which means that GPT-3.5 16K
840720	849040	is now cheaper than the previous GPT-3.5 4K model. Running a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Turbo 16K
849040	855280	version is also cheaper than the old fine-tuned 4K version. Okay, so we just covered a lot
855280	860240	about the model itself. We hope that these changes address your feedback. We're really excited to
860240	867280	bring all of these improvements to everybody now. In all of this, we're lucky to have a partner
867360	872800	who is instrumental in making it happen. So I'd like to bring out a special guest, Satya Nadella,
872800	874000	the CEO of Microsoft.
879840	885280	Good to see you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Satya, thanks so much for coming here.
885280	890640	It's fantastic to be here, and Sam, congrats. I mean, I'm really looking forward to Turbo and
890640	894000	everything else that you have coming. It's been just fantastic partnering with you guys.
894960	899120	Two questions. I won't take too much of your time. How is Microsoft thinking about the partnership
899120	910560	currently? First, we love you guys. It's been fantastic for us. In fact, I remember the first
910560	914320	time I think you reached out and said, hey, do you have some Azure credits? We've come a long way
914320	920160	from there. Thank you for those. That was great. You guys have built something magical. I mean,
920240	924960	quite frankly, there are two things for us when it comes to the partnership. The first is these
924960	929200	workloads. And even when I was listening backstage to how you're describing what's coming even,
929200	933760	it's just so different and new. I've been in this infrastructure business for three decades.
933760	938480	No one has ever seen infrastructure like this. And the workload or the pattern of the workload,
938480	945920	these training jobs are so synchronous and so large and so data parallel. And so the first thing
945920	950800	that we have been doing is building in partnership with you the system all the way from thinking from
950800	959360	power to the DC to the rack to the accelerators to the network. And just really the shape of Azure
959360	965200	is drastically changed and is changing rapidly in support of these models that you're building.
965840	971200	And so our job number one is to build the best system so that you can build the best models
971200	975760	and then make that all available to developers. And so the other thing is we ourselves are
975760	981360	developers. So we're building products. In fact, my own conviction of this entire generation of
981360	989440	Foundation models completely changed the first time I saw GitHub Copilot on GPT. And so we want
989440	996240	to build our Copilot, GitHub Copilot all as developers on top of OpenAI APIs. And so we are
996240	1000720	very, very committed to that. And what does that mean to developers? You know, look, I always think
1000720	1006160	of Microsoft as a platform company, a developer company and a partner company. And so we want to
1006160	1010880	make, you know, for example, we want to make GitHub available, GitHub Copilot available as the
1010880	1015200	enterprise edition available to all the attendees here so that they can try it out. That's awesome.
1015200	1024480	Yeah, we're very excited about that. And you can count on us to build the best infrastructure in
1024480	1031040	Azure with your API support and bring it to all of you and then even things like the Azure marketplace.
1031040	1035760	So for developers, we're building products out here to get to market rapidly. So that's sort of
1035760	1040560	really our intent here. Great. And how do you think about the future? Future of the partnership or
1040560	1047520	future of AI or whatever? Yeah, there's anything you want. That's, you know, like, there are a
1047520	1052720	couple of things for me that I think are going to be very, very key for us, right? One is I just
1052720	1060000	described how the systems that are needed as you aggressively push forward on your roadmap
1061120	1066960	requires us to be on the top of our game. And we intend fully to commit ourselves deeply to
1066960	1074000	making sure you all as builders of these foundation models have not only the best systems for training
1074000	1080480	and inference, but the most compute so that you can keep pushing forward on the frontiers. Because
1080480	1084560	I think that that's the way we're going to make progress. The second thing I think both of us care
1084560	1089920	about, in fact, quite frankly, the thing that excited both sides to come together is your mission
1089920	1094400	and our mission. Our mission is to empower every person in every organization on the planet to
1094400	1099360	achieve more. And to me, ultimately, AI is only going to be useful if it truly does empower,
1099360	1103360	right? I mean, I saw the video you played early. I mean, that was fantastic to see
1104400	1109840	hear those voices, describe what AI meant for them and what they were able to achieve. So ultimately,
1109840	1115360	it's about being able to get the benefits of AI broadly disseminated to everyone, I think is
1115360	1118560	going to be the goal for us. And then the last thing is, of course, we're very grounded in the
1118560	1122240	fact that safety matters and safety is not something that you'd care about later, but it's
1122240	1127680	something we do shift left on. And we're very focused on that with you all. Great. Well, I think
1127680	1131360	we have the best partnership in tech. I'm excited for us to build AGI together. I'm really excited.
1131840	1145200	Thank you very much for coming. Thank you so much. Okay. So we have shared a lot of great
1145200	1150160	updates for developers already, and we got a lot more to come. But even though this is developer
1150160	1158000	conference, we can't resist making some improvements to chat GPT. So a small one, chat GPT now uses
1158080	1162320	GPT-4 Turbo with all the latest improvements, including the latest knowledge cutoff, which
1162320	1168000	will continue to update. That's all live today. It can now browse the web when it needs to write
1168000	1173040	and run code, analyze data, take and generate images, and much more. And we heard your feedback,
1173040	1177520	that model picker, extremely annoying. That is gone starting today. You will not have to click
1177520	1181920	around to drop down menu. All of this will just work together. Chat GPT, yeah.
1182560	1192720	Chat GPT will just know what to use and when you need it. But that's not the main thing.
1194560	1199040	And neither was price, actually, the main developer request. There was one that was even
1199040	1203680	bigger than that. And I want to talk about where we're headed, and the main thing we're here to
1203680	1209920	talk about today. So we believe that if you give people better tools, they will do amazing things.
1210480	1214880	We know that people want AI that is smarter, more personal, more customizable,
1214880	1219760	can do more on your behalf. Eventually, you'll just ask a computer for what you need,
1220560	1226160	and it will do all of these tasks for you. These capabilities are often talked in the AI field
1226160	1234080	about as agents. The upsides of this are going to be tremendous. At OpenAI, we really believe
1234080	1238880	that gradual iterative deployment is the best way to address the safety issues, the safety
1238880	1243760	challenges with AI. We think it's especially important to move carefully towards this future
1243760	1248960	of agents. It's going to require a lot of technical work and a lot of thoughtful consideration by
1248960	1256480	society. So today, we're taking our first small step that moves us towards this future. We're
1256480	1265920	thrilled to introduce GPTs. GPTs are tailored versions of Chat GPT for a specific purpose.
1266880	1273120	You can build a GPT, a customized version of Chat GPT for almost anything, with instructions,
1273760	1278080	expanded knowledge, and actions, and then you can publish it for others to use.
1279360	1282880	And because they combine instructions, expanded knowledge, and actions,
1283760	1287760	they can be more helpful to you. They can work better in many contexts, and they can give you
1287760	1293200	better control. They'll make it easier for you to accomplish all sorts of tasks or just have more
1293280	1300400	fun, and you'll be able to use them right within Chat GPT. You can, in effect, program a GPT with
1300400	1305200	language just by talking to it. It's easy to customize the behavior so that it fits what you
1305200	1312080	want. This makes building them very accessible, and it gives agency to everyone. So we're going to
1312080	1317840	show you what GPTs are, how to use them, how to build them, and then we're going to talk about how
1317840	1322000	they'll be distributed and discovered. And then after that, for developers, we're going to show
1322000	1327840	you how to build these agent-like experiences into your own apps. So first, let's look at a few
1327840	1334640	examples. Our partners at Code.org are working hard to expand computer science in schools.
1335360	1341280	They've got a curriculum that is used by tens of millions of students worldwide. Code.org crafted
1341280	1345920	lesson planner GPT to help teachers provide a more engaging experience for middle schoolers.
1346160	1352000	If a teacher asks it to explain four loops in a creative way, it does just that. In this case,
1352000	1356480	it'll do it in terms of a video game character, repeatedly picking up coins, super easy to
1356480	1362560	understand for an eighth grader. As you can see, this GPT brings together Code.org's extensive
1362560	1367200	curriculum and expertise and lets teachers adapt it to their needs quickly and easily.
1368480	1374960	Next, Canva has built a GPT that lets you start designing by describing what you want and
1375920	1381840	natural language. If you say, make a poster for a Dev Day reception this afternoon, this evening,
1381840	1386560	and you give it some details, it'll generate a few options to start with by hitting Canva's
1386560	1392240	APIs. Now, this concept may be familiar to some of you. We've evolved our plugins to be custom
1392240	1398560	actions for GPTs. You can keep chatting with this to see different iterations, and when you see one
1398560	1405520	you like, you can click through to Canva for the full design experience. So now, we'd like to show
1405520	1413280	you a GPT live. Zapier has built a GPT that lets you perform actions across 6,000 applications
1413280	1418160	to unlock all kinds of integration possibilities. I'd like to introduce Jessica, one of our
1418160	1421360	solutions architects, who is going to drive this demo. Welcome, Jessica.
1430240	1434480	Thank you all for being here. My name is Jessica Shea. I work with partners and customers to bring
1434480	1439760	their product alive. And today, I can't wait to show you how hard we've been working on this,
1439760	1445920	so let's get started. So to start, where your GPT will live is on this upper left corner.
1445920	1451920	I'm going to start with clicking on the Zapier AI actions. And on the right hand side, you can see
1451920	1457920	that's my calendar for today. So it's quite a day. I've already used this before, so it's actually
1457920	1464560	already connected to my calendar. To start, I can ask, what's on my schedule for today? We built
1464560	1471280	GPTs with security in mind. So before it performs any action or share data, it will ask for your
1471280	1478800	permission. So right here, I'm going to say allowed. So GPT is designed to take in your
1478800	1483920	instructions, make the decision on which capability to call to perform that action,
1483920	1489280	and then execute that for you. So you can see right here, it's already connected to my calendar.
1489280	1496720	It pulls into my information. And then I've also prompted it to identify conflicts on my calendar.
1496720	1502160	So you can see right here, it actually was able to identify that. So it looks like I have
1502160	1506880	something coming up. So what if I want to let Sam know that I have to leave early? So right here,
1506880	1517760	I say, let Sam know. I got to go. Chasing GPUs. So with that, I'm going to swap to
1518800	1523360	my conversation with Sam. And then I'm going to say, yes, please run that.
1526960	1531760	Sam, did you get that? I did. Awesome.
1534720	1541840	So this is only a glimpse of what is possible. And I cannot wait to see what you all will build.
1541840	1543120	Thank you. And back to you, Sam.
1550800	1553840	Thank you, Jessica. So those are three great examples.
1554800	1558720	In addition to these, there are many more kinds of GPTs that people are creating,
1558720	1564240	and many, many more that will be created soon. We know that many people who want to build the
1564240	1570880	GPT don't know how to code. We've made it so that you can program the GPT just by having a conversation.
1572160	1576000	We believe that natural language is going to be a big part of how people use computers in the
1576000	1580720	future. And we think this is an interesting early example. So I'd like to show you how to build one.
1584720	1590800	All right. So I'm going to create a GPT that helps give founders and developers advice when
1590800	1599040	starting new projects. I'm going to go to create a GPT here. And this drops me into the GPT builder.
1600160	1604800	I worked with founders for years at YC. And still, whenever I meet developers, the questions I get
1604800	1608240	are always about how do I, you know, think about a business idea? Can you give me some advice?
1609120	1611120	I'm going to see if I can build a GPT to help with that.
1612000	1618640	So to start, GPT builder asks me what I want to make. And I'm going to say I want to help startup
1618640	1631040	founders think through their business ideas and get advice after the founder has gotten some advice,
1631040	1643520	grill them on why they are not growing faster. All right. So to start off, I just tell the GPT
1643520	1647440	a little bit about what I want here. And it's going to go off and start thinking about that.
1648480	1653200	It's going to write some detailed instructions for the GPT. It's also going to, let's see,
1653200	1660080	ask me about a name. How do I feel about startup mentor? That's fine. That's good. So if I didn't
1660080	1663920	like the name, of course, I could call it something else, but it's going to try to have this conversation
1663920	1670160	with me and start there. And you can see here on the right in the preview mode that it's already
1670160	1676960	starting to fill out the GPT, where it says what it does. It has some ideas of additional
1676960	1684080	questions that I could ask. And you know what? So it just generated a candidate. Of course,
1684080	1690160	I could regenerate that or change it, but I sort of like that. So I will say that's great.
1692800	1698480	And you see now that the GPT is being built out a little bit more as we go. Now, what I want this
1698480	1703440	to do, how it can interact with users, I could talk about style here. But what I'm going to say
1704000	1712880	is I am going to upload transcripts of some lectures about startups I have given.
1713760	1723600	Please give advice based off of those. All right. So now it's going to go figure out how to do that.
1723600	1727440	And I would like to show you the configure tab. So you can see some of the things that were built
1727440	1732640	out here as we were going by the builder itself. And you can see that there's capabilities here
1732640	1738480	that I can enable. I could add custom actions. These are all fine to leave. I'm going to upload
1738480	1747280	a file. So here is a lecture that I gave with some startup advice. And I'm going to add that here.
1747280	1754960	In terms of these questions, this is a dumb one. The rest of those are reasonable. And like very
1754960	1759440	much things founders often ask. I'm going to add one more thing to the instructions here,
1759520	1767840	which is be concise and constructive with feedback. All right. So again, if we had more
1767840	1774480	time, I'd show you a bunch of other things. But this is like a decent start. And now we can try
1774480	1781200	it out over on this preview tab. So I will say, what's a common question? What are three things
1781200	1789840	to look for when hiring employees at an early stage startup?
1793760	1797120	Now, it's going to look at that document I uploaded. It will also have, of course,
1797120	1804640	all of the background knowledge of GPT-4. That's pretty good. Those are three things
1804640	1809200	that I definitely have said many times. Now, we could go on and it would start
1809200	1813760	following the other instructions and grill me on why I'm not growing faster. But in the interest
1813760	1820080	of time, I'm going to skip that. I'm going to publish this only to me for now. I can work on it
1820080	1824240	later. I can add more content. I can add a few actions that I think would be useful. And then
1824240	1830320	I can share it publicly. So that's what it looks like to create a GPT. Thank you.
1830640	1841360	By the way, I always wanted to do that after all of the YC office hours. I always thought,
1841360	1844320	man, someday I will be able to make a bot that will do this and that will be awesome.
1846560	1852560	So with GPTs, we're letting people easily share and discover all the fun ways that they use chat
1852560	1859920	GPT with the world. You can make private GPTs like I just did. Or you can share your
1859920	1866480	creations publicly with a link for anyone to use. Or if you're on chat GPT enterprise,
1866480	1873520	you can make GPTs just for your company. And later this month, we're going to launch the GPT
1873520	1887280	store. You can list a GPT. Thank you. I appreciate that. You can list a GPT there and we'll be
1887280	1893360	able to feature the best and the most popular GPTs. Of course, we'll make sure that GPTs in the store
1893360	1900400	follow our policies before they're accessible. Revenue sharing is important to us. We're going
1900400	1905360	to pay people who build the most useful and the most used GPTs a portion of our revenue.
1906320	1911040	We're excited to foster a vibrant ecosystem with the GPT store. Just from what we've been building
1911040	1914400	ourselves over the weekend, we're confident there's going to be a lot of great stuff.
1914400	1920400	We're excited to share more information soon. So those are GPTs and we can't wait to see what you
1920400	1926240	build. But this is a developer conference and the coolest thing about this is that we're bringing
1926240	1938560	the same concept to the API. Many of you have already been building agent-like experiences
1938640	1945200	on the API. For example, Shopify's Sidekick, which lets you take actions on the platform,
1945200	1951360	Discord's Clyde, let's Discord moderators create custom personalities for, and SnapsMyAI,
1952080	1955760	a customized chatbot that can be added to group chats and make recommendations.
1956400	1961920	These experiences are great, but they have been hard to build. Sometimes taking months,
1961920	1966960	teams of dozens of engineers, there's a lot to handle to make this custom assistant experience.
1968800	1972400	So today, we're making that a lot easier with our new Assistance API.
1978160	1982720	The Assistance API includes persistent threads so they don't have to figure out how to deal with
1982720	1989520	long conversation history, built-in retrieval, code interpreter, a working Python interpreter,
1989520	1994640	and a sandbox environment, and, of course, the improved function calling that we talked about
1994640	2001280	earlier. So we'd like to show you a demo of how this works, and here is Roman, our head of developer
2001280	2011840	experience. Welcome. Thank you, Sam. Good morning. Wow, it's fantastic to see you all here.
2013280	2019680	It's been so inspiring to see so many of you infusing AI into your apps. Today, we're launching
2019680	2025680	new modalities in the API, but we're also very excited to improve the developer experience for
2025680	2032240	you all to build Assistive Agents. So let's dive right in. Imagine I'm building Wanderlust,
2032240	2037840	a travel app for global explorers, and this is the landing page. I've actually used GPT4 to come
2037840	2042560	up with these destination ideas, and for those of you with the keen eye, these illustrations
2042560	2047840	are generated programmatically using the new Dolly 3 API available to all of you today. So
2047840	2055520	it's pretty remarkable. But let's enhance this app by adding a very simple Assistant to it. This is
2055520	2059280	the screen. We're going to come back to it in a second. First, I'm going to switch over to the
2059280	2065120	new Assistant's Playground. Creating an Assistant is easy. You just give it a name, some initial
2065120	2070880	instructions, a model, in this case, I'll pick GPT4 Turbo, and here I'll also go ahead and select
2070880	2077200	some tools. I'll turn on code interpreter and retrieval and save. And that's it. Our Assistant
2077280	2083200	is ready to go. Next, I can integrate with two new primitives of this Assistant's API,
2083840	2091040	threads and messages. Let's take a quick look at the code. The process here is very simple. For
2091040	2096480	each new user, I will create a new thread, and as these users engage with their Assistant,
2096480	2102720	I will add their messages to these threads. Very simple. And then I can simply run the Assistant
2102720	2108640	at any time to stream the responses back to the app. So we can return to the app and try that in
2108640	2118560	action. If I say, hey, let's go to Paris. All right. That's it. With just a few lines of code,
2118560	2124880	users can now have a very specialized Assistant right inside the app. And I'd like to highlight
2124880	2130160	one of my favorite features here, Function Calling. If you have not used it yet, Function Calling is
2130160	2135840	really powerful. And as Sam mentioned, we're taking it a step further today. It now guarantees
2135840	2141600	the JSON output with no added latency. And you can invoke multiple functions at once for the first
2141600	2150480	time. So here, if I carry on and say, hey, what are the top 10 things to do? I'm going to have the
2150480	2155840	Assistant respond to that again. And here, what's interesting is that the Assistant knows about
2155840	2160800	functions, including those to annotate the map that you see on the right. And so now all of these
2160800	2171680	pins are dropping in real time here. Yeah. It's pretty cool. And that integration allows our
2171680	2176960	natural language interface to interact fluidly with components and features of our app. And it
2176960	2183360	truly showcases now the harmony you can build between AI and UI where the Assistant is actually
2183440	2190160	taking action. But next, let's talk about retrieval. And retrieval is about giving our Assistant more
2190160	2195200	knowledge beyond these immediate user messages. In fact, I got inspired and I already booked my
2195200	2201200	tickets to Paris. So I'm just going to drag and drop here this PDF. While it's uploading, I can
2201200	2208560	just sneak peek at it. Very typical United Flight ticket. And behind the scene here, what's happening
2208560	2214720	is that retrieval is reading these files and boom, the information about this PDF appeared on the
2214720	2223520	screen. And this is, of course, a very tiny PDF, but Assistant can parse long-form documents from
2223520	2228240	extensive text to intricate product specs, depending on what you're building. In fact, I also booked an
2228240	2233600	Airbnb, so I'm just going to drag that over to the conversation as well. And by the way, we've heard
2233600	2238560	from so many of you developers how hard that is to build yourself. You typically need to compute
2238560	2243120	your embeddings. You need to set up chunking algorithm. Now, all of that is taken care of.
2244560	2249760	And there's more than retrieval. With every API call, you usually need to resend the entire
2249760	2255360	conversation history, which means setting up a key value store. That means handling the context
2255360	2260640	windows, serializing messages and so forth. That complexity now completely goes away with this
2260640	2267200	new stateful API. But just because a Ponyi is managing this API does not mean it's a black box.
2267200	2271840	In fact, you can see the steps that the tools are taking right inside your developer dashboard.
2271840	2278080	So here, if I go ahead and click on threads, this is the thread I believe we're currently
2278080	2283200	working on. And see, like, these are all the steps, including the functions being called with the
2283200	2290160	right parameters and the PDFs I've just uploaded. But let's move on to a new capability that many
2290160	2295280	of you have been requesting for a while. Code interpreter is now available today in the API as
2295280	2302000	well. That gives the AI the ability to write and execute code on the fly, but even generate files.
2302000	2310720	So let's see that in action. If I say here, hey, will be four friends staying at DCRBNB,
2310960	2325280	what's my share of it plus my flights? All right. Now here, what's happening is that code
2325280	2330960	interpreter noticed that it should write some code to answer this query. So now it's computing,
2330960	2334880	you know, the number of days in Paris, the number of friends, it's also doing some exchange rate
2334880	2340240	calculation behind the scene to get this answer for us. Not the most complex math, but you get
2340240	2345360	the picture. Imagine you're building a very complex like finance app that's crunching countless
2345360	2350480	numbers, plotting charts, so really any task that you'd normally tackle with code, then code
2350480	2357040	interpreter will work great for you. All right. I think my trip to Paris is sorted. So to recap
2357040	2361840	here, we've just seen how you can quickly create an assistant that manages state for your user
2361840	2366800	conversations, leverages external tools like knowledge and retrieval and code interpreter,
2366880	2370080	and finally invokes your own functions to make things happen.
2371840	2376640	But there's one more thing I wanted to show you to kind of really open up the possibilities
2376640	2380800	using function calling combined with our new modalities that we're launching today.
2381600	2386640	While working on Dev Day, I've built a small custom assistant that knows everything about
2386640	2391280	this event. But instead of having a chat interface while running around all day today,
2391280	2397200	I thought, why not use voice instead? So let's bring my phone up on screen here so you can see
2397200	2402560	it on the right. Awesome. So on the right, you can see a very simple Swift app that takes microphone
2402560	2407360	input. And on the left, I'm actually going to bring up my terminal log so you can see what's
2407360	2414240	happening behind the scenes. So let's give it a shot. Hey there, I'm on the keynote stage right
2414240	2423600	now. Can you greet our attendees here at Dev Day? Hey everyone, welcome to Dev Day.
2423600	2426720	It's awesome to have you all here. Let's make it an incredible day.
2432800	2438000	Isn't that impressive? You have six unique and rich voices to choose from in the API,
2438000	2442080	each speaking multiple languages so you can really find the perfect fit for your app.
2442640	2446400	And on my laptop here on the left, you can see the logs of what's happening behind the scenes too.
2446400	2451920	So I'm using Whisper to convert the voice inputs into text, an assistant with GPT4 Turbo,
2451920	2457760	and finally the new TTS API to make it speak. But thanks to function calling,
2457760	2462240	things get even more interesting when the assistant can connect to the Internet
2462240	2467840	and take real actions for users. So let's do something even more exciting here together.
2467920	2475280	How about this? Hey assistant, can you randomly select five Dev Day attendees here
2475280	2482640	and give them $500 in OpenAI credits? Yes, checking the list of attendees.
2487280	2492320	Done, I picked five Dev Day attendees and added $500 of API credits to their account.
2492400	2497120	Congrats to Christine M, Jonathan C, Steven G, Louise K, and Suraj S.
2498160	2501200	All right, if you recognize yourself, awesome, congrats.
2503360	2506880	And that's it, a quick overview today of the new Assistant API
2506880	2509680	combined with some of the new tools and modalities that we launched.
2510480	2515520	All starting with the simplicity of a rich text or voice conversation for you and users.
2516080	2519360	We really can't wait to see what you build and congrats to our lucky winners.
2520080	2524880	Actually, you know what? You're all part of this amazing OpenAI community here,
2524880	2528320	so I'm just going to talk to my assistant one last time before I step off the stage.
2530560	2536000	Hey assistant, can you actually give everyone here in the audience $500 in OpenAI credits?
2537840	2539760	Sounds great. Let me go through everyone.
2540480	2552000	All right, that function will keep running, but I've run out of time,
2552000	2554960	so thank you so much, everyone. Have a great day. Back to you, Sam.
2564400	2565120	Pretty cool, huh?
2565600	2574400	All right, so that Assistant API goes into beta today, and we are super excited to see what
2574400	2582000	you all do with it. Anybody can enable it. Over time, GPTs and assistants, our precursors to agents,
2582800	2586800	are going to be able to do much, much more. They'll gradually be able to plan
2587360	2592560	and to perform more complex actions on your behalf. As I mentioned before,
2592560	2595920	we really believe in the importance of gradual iterative deployment.
2596720	2600800	We believe it's important for people to start building with and using these agents now
2600800	2604400	to get a feel for what the world is going to be like as they become more capable,
2605360	2609840	and as we've always done, we'll continue to update our systems based off of your feedback.
2611120	2614560	So we're super excited that we got to share all of this with you today.
2615840	2620960	We introduced GPTs, custom versions of chat GPT that combine instructions,
2621600	2626960	extended knowledge, and actions. We launched the Assistance API to make it easier to build
2626960	2632800	assisted experiences with your own apps. These are our first steps towards AI agents,
2632800	2639200	and we'll be increasing their capabilities over time. We introduced a new GPT-4 turbo model that
2639200	2644240	delivers improved function calling, knowledge, lowered pricing, new modalities, and more,
2645040	2646960	and we're deepening our partnership with Microsoft.
2647920	2654480	In closing, I wanted to take a minute to thank the team that creates all of this. Open AI has
2654480	2660080	gotten remarkable talent density, but still, it takes a huge amount of hard work and coordination
2660080	2663760	to make all of this happen. I truly believe that I've got the best colleagues in the world.
2663760	2669680	I feel incredibly grateful to get to work with them. We do all of this because we believe the AI
2669680	2674560	is going to be a technological and societal revolution. It will change the world in many ways,
2675280	2679600	and we're happy to get to work on something that will empower all of you to build so much for all
2679600	2685680	of us. We talked about earlier how if you give people better tools, they can change the world.
2686800	2690640	We believe that AI will be about individual empowerment and agency at a scale that we've
2690640	2695120	never seen before, and that will elevate humanity to a scale that we've never seen before either.
2695920	2701680	We'll be able to do more to create more and to have more. As intelligence gets integrated
2701680	2707200	everywhere, we will all have superpowers on demand. We're excited to see what you all will do with
2707200	2711360	this technology and to discover the new future that we're all going to architect together.
2712880	2717200	We hope that you'll come back next year. What we launched today is going to look very quaint
2717200	2721040	relative to what we're busy creating for you now. Thank you for all that you do.
2721040	2735600	Thanks for coming here today.
