Processing Overview for GDQuest
============================
Checking GDQuest/Auto-Completion for Blender Python in Any Editor.txt
1. **Blender's Internal Auto-Completion**: In Blender, you can get auto-completion for Python scripts within the Blender editor by pressing `Ctrl + Space` after typing or after a dot. This feature works with Blender's internal scripting environment but may not be sufficient when working with complex projects involving multiple files in an external text editor.

2. **External Text Editor Limitations**: When using an external text editor, you typically do not have access to Blender's auto-completion features. However, you can get documentation by hovering over elements in the Blender Python console.

3. **Nutty's Fake BPI Module**: A developer named Nutty created a script that generates Python modules from the Blender sources without any actual code. These modules contain only the function names and docstrings, which are enough for auto-completion tools like Jedi to work effectively.

4. **Using the Fake BPI Module**: To use the fake BPI module for auto-completion in an external text editor:
   - Download the zip file containing the modules from the provided link (specifically for Blender versions 2.78 and 2.79, as the Python API for Blender 2.8/2.9 is not yet stable).
   - Extract the zip file to access the generated Python modules.
   - Copy these modules to your Python installation folder (you can find this by searching for your Python executable, right-clicking, and selecting "Open file location," then navigating to the `lib` folder).
   - Paste the copied modules into your Python `lib` folder where you also find other Blender libraries like BPI and BGL.

5. **Enjoying Auto-Completion**: After placing the fake BPI modules in your Python `lib` folder, you should have auto-completion support in any text editor that supports the feature (like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.), provided you have a service like Autocomplete or a language server for Python.

6. **Conclusion**: With the fake BPI module installed, you can now enjoy robust auto-completion features for Blender's Python API in your preferred external text editor, making it easier to develop Blender add-ons and scripts.
