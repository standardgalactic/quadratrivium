In Blender, you can get auto-completion for whatever you type in the text editor on Python script

00:08.000 --> 00:14.360
by pressing control space to complete the current entry you are writing or after a dot.

00:14.360 --> 00:20.280
You can fire control space to get some suggestions, but by default they don't work so well.

00:20.280 --> 00:28.480
And you can have that also in the Python console and in this case, it's a little more helpful

00:28.560 --> 00:35.200
because you can really get a list of all the properties you will find at a given stage

00:35.200 --> 00:43.200
in the auto-completion step. If you are working on an add-on with dozens of files, it's not enough

00:43.200 --> 00:50.320
to use Blender because you don't have all the file navigations and suggestions or auto-completion

00:50.320 --> 00:56.560
from other files you import from. So what if you want to work in an external text editor?

00:56.560 --> 01:02.880
By default, you won't have auto-completion. Now, if I hover something, you will see that I do.

01:02.880 --> 01:11.120
I do get documentation on elements I hover, can even get documentation for built-in operators

01:11.120 --> 01:18.640
and values and modules. So I'm going to show you how to get that and how to get rich auto-completion

01:18.640 --> 01:26.960
as well, auto-complete on the sequencer and get all the available operators. Normally,

01:26.960 --> 01:34.800
you have to build Blender as a Python module to do that and place that module in your Python

01:34.800 --> 01:41.200
installation folder. And building it, especially on Windows, can be a bit involved. On Linux,

01:41.200 --> 01:48.320
it should be much easier. But you don't have to do that thanks to Nutty, who created a fake

01:48.320 --> 01:56.800
BPI module as he calls it. So he created a script that from the Blender sources will generate

01:56.800 --> 02:04.160
Python modules that have the functions, the classes you would find in Blender Python,

02:04.160 --> 02:11.440
but it doesn't have any actual code. You only get the definitions. And that is all you need

02:11.440 --> 02:19.120
to get auto-completion. Auto-completion tools like Jedi and all will read the function names and the

02:19.120 --> 02:25.680
doc strings, but that is it. They don't know much about the implementation or the actual code in

02:25.680 --> 02:30.400
these tools. If you don't even have to run the script, although you can run it on the Blender

02:30.400 --> 02:38.000
sources to generate all these modules, you can just download this as a zip and you can find the link

02:38.000 --> 02:44.560
in the description. And we're going to put all that in our Python folder. So here I am

02:44.560 --> 02:52.960
with the fake BPI module downloaded as zip. I'm going to unfold it. And note that at the moment,

02:52.960 --> 03:03.680
you will only find modules for the 278 and 279 versions of Blender because 2.8 is not available

03:03.680 --> 03:10.480
yet. The Python API is not stable yet. So that's why you won't find auto-completion targets for it.

03:11.600 --> 03:17.200
So once we've unzipped everything, we're going to head to the folder that corresponds to your

03:17.200 --> 03:26.000
Blender version and grab everything, copy. Now we want to put it in our Python install folder.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.880
On Windows to find it, you press Windows S to do a global search and search for your Python

03:32.880 --> 03:39.360
executable. Right click on it, open the file location. And it's going to be a shortcut,

03:39.360 --> 03:48.000
in which case you want to open the target folder. So this is where my 3.7 install of Python lives.

03:48.560 --> 03:55.120
And we want to go to the lib folder where you will find lots of Python libraries. So I have

03:55.680 --> 04:05.920
BPI somewhere in here, as you can see. I also have BGL, all the Blender libraries we just saw.

04:06.560 --> 04:14.480
All you want to do is right click and paste everything in here. Once you copied all the files,

04:14.480 --> 04:21.440
you are done. You should get auto-completion in all the text editors that you may use that have

04:21.440 --> 04:28.640
support for a service like Autocomplete or the Python language server or that use GDI for

04:28.640 --> 04:34.880
Autocompletion. And there you go. You can see everything's working as you'd expect. Enjoy

04:34.880 --> 04:40.240
coding Blender Python scripts and add-ons in your favorite editors. And to get started with

04:40.240 --> 04:46.000
Blender's Python operators, check the previous videos that we made, link on the screen in the

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
description. Thank you kindly for watching. Be creative, have fun, and see you in the next one.
