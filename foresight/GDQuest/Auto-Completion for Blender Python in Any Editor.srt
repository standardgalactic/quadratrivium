00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In Blender, you can get auto-completion for whatever you type in the text editor on Python script

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,360
by pressing control space to complete the current entry you are writing or after a dot.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,280
You can fire control space to get some suggestions, but by default they don't work so well.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:28,480
And you can have that also in the Python console and in this case, it's a little more helpful

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,200
because you can really get a list of all the properties you will find at a given stage

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:43,200
in the auto-completion step. If you are working on an add-on with dozens of files, it's not enough

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,320
to use Blender because you don't have all the file navigations and suggestions or auto-completion

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,560
from other files you import from. So what if you want to work in an external text editor?

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,880
By default, you won't have auto-completion. Now, if I hover something, you will see that I do.

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:11,120
I do get documentation on elements I hover, can even get documentation for built-in operators

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:18,640
and values and modules. So I'm going to show you how to get that and how to get rich auto-completion

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:26,960
as well, auto-complete on the sequencer and get all the available operators. Normally,

13
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,800
you have to build Blender as a Python module to do that and place that module in your Python

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,200
installation folder. And building it, especially on Windows, can be a bit involved. On Linux,

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,320
it should be much easier. But you don't have to do that thanks to Nutty, who created a fake

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:56,800
BPI module as he calls it. So he created a script that from the Blender sources will generate

17
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:04,160
Python modules that have the functions, the classes you would find in Blender Python,

18
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:11,440
but it doesn't have any actual code. You only get the definitions. And that is all you need

19
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:19,120
to get auto-completion. Auto-completion tools like Jedi and all will read the function names and the

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,680
doc strings, but that is it. They don't know much about the implementation or the actual code in

21
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,400
these tools. If you don't even have to run the script, although you can run it on the Blender

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:38,000
sources to generate all these modules, you can just download this as a zip and you can find the link

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,560
in the description. And we're going to put all that in our Python folder. So here I am

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,960
with the fake BPI module downloaded as zip. I'm going to unfold it. And note that at the moment,

25
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:03,680
you will only find modules for the 278 and 279 versions of Blender because 2.8 is not available

26
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,480
yet. The Python API is not stable yet. So that's why you won't find auto-completion targets for it.

27
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,200
So once we've unzipped everything, we're going to head to the folder that corresponds to your

28
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:26,000
Blender version and grab everything, copy. Now we want to put it in our Python install folder.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,880
On Windows to find it, you press Windows S to do a global search and search for your Python

30
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:39,360
executable. Right click on it, open the file location. And it's going to be a shortcut,

31
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:48,000
in which case you want to open the target folder. So this is where my 3.7 install of Python lives.

32
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,120
And we want to go to the lib folder where you will find lots of Python libraries. So I have

33
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:05,920
BPI somewhere in here, as you can see. I also have BGL, all the Blender libraries we just saw.

34
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:14,480
All you want to do is right click and paste everything in here. Once you copied all the files,

35
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:21,440
you are done. You should get auto-completion in all the text editors that you may use that have

36
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,640
support for a service like Autocomplete or the Python language server or that use GDI for

37
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,880
Autocompletion. And there you go. You can see everything's working as you'd expect. Enjoy

38
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,240
coding Blender Python scripts and add-ons in your favorite editors. And to get started with

39
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,000
Blender's Python operators, check the previous videos that we made, link on the screen in the

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
description. Thank you kindly for watching. Be creative, have fun, and see you in the next one.
