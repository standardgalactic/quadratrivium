0	13160	I want to start with a quote to get things moving from from Mr. Voltaire, and I'm curious
13160	16160	your perception of it. I feel like you'll probably have some thoughts.
16160	21480	A quote that I find interesting is, if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent
21480	26240	him. So I think it's interesting that Voltaire chooses him. I think that's worth discussing
26240	33680	as well, and also the necessity to invent said God. If it, she, him did not exist in
33680	38000	some absolute manner. What do you think about all that?
38000	43800	I mean, I understand the impetus behind the quote in the sense that one of the things
43800	48400	I think we're seeing more easily right now is we had a moment where we, some people,
48400	52600	at least some people thought that we could just be rational and scientific and we could
52600	58120	just get rid of all these superstitions, then we would, we'd be good, we'd be fine.
58120	64120	And what we're noticing is that that's not what's happening. People are becoming nihilistic,
64120	68040	you know, they're moving into despair. We're noticing we don't have much to hold us together
68040	73640	in terms of societies. We don't have things that bind us anymore as we get rid of, as
73640	78200	we get rid of religion, as we get rid of God. And so I think that that's probably what Voltaire
78200	83080	was perceiving was the notion that we need something above us, something transcendent
83080	89360	to unify us, or else we tend to fragment and to scatter. So I think that the intuition
89360	96240	behind, behind Voltaire is right. And you see a lot of people that say today, taking
96240	100560	that very cynically in the sense that they realize we need something to bind us together
100560	105560	so it could be anything, we could just put something up there. And we just need, we need
105560	109160	it, or else we need to celebrate something together, or else why are we something, why
109160	113400	are we a country, why are we a nation, why are we a family, why are we a group rather
113400	116400	than just a bunch of individuals slamming against each other.
116400	122040	I reflect on that quite regularly, internally at a deeper level, I have a sensation of like,
122040	129080	I can have a sensation of like, aimlessness. And a part of that I have these various, like
129080	134400	what I would concede to be like illusions of perceived progress. And that's something
134400	138360	that I, I ask a lot of, I feel like most people can kind of collectively agree of like, yeah,
138360	143880	like progress, like, well, let's, let's do progress. And then that presents the question
143880	147960	of like, okay, perfect, I love, love that love the morale, but like progress towards
147960	152680	what? Like what is our ultimate end goal here? What are we progressing toward?
152680	157960	No, I totally agree that that's definitely a problem, especially in terms of modern kind
157960	163960	of atheist progressive narrative, which is that, what are we aiming at? Because in order
164000	167880	to progress, you need an aim, you need to be moving in a direction or else you're just
167880	173440	aimlessly wandering. And so the question is, what is it that's happening? It's easier.
173440	177800	I think one of the mistakes that we've seen in the, in with the enlightenment and, and
177800	183680	it's, and what came after is we had this idea that if we progress in terms of technical
183680	189320	knowledge, that is, if we accumulate technical knowledge, then that's similar to the manner
189360	193680	in which we're going to progress morally as a nation, as nations, as people, but those
193680	198440	are not, they're not the same. The accumulation of technical knowledge is not the same as
198440	203960	morality or, or understanding what it is that makes a life worth living. These are not the
203960	209560	same thing. And I don't think that we have progressed in that at all. I think on the
209560	216560	contrary, I think that we have traded one for the other. We've traded a kind of comfort,
216800	223320	technical comfort and material comfort. We've traded that for purpose and we've traded that
223320	229720	for virtue and for a sense that we are moving towards something valuable. And because of
229720	235000	it, people are, people are lost. Well, not everybody, but there's definitely a sense
235000	239720	around us. When I look at young people, especially, you know, the despair is palpable.
240240	246360	Yeah. Yeah. And so you, so you asked before, we press record, like, why, like, why the heck
246360	253680	do you have me here? I'm like a theologian icon, iconographer, philosopher, like, what does
253680	257160	this have to do with like, this is supposed to be like a health thing or something? One,
257160	263440	there's like, I had John Revekey on recently, and I know that you guys are close. And one
263440	267600	of the things that came up with that was like the, the meaning crisis, like we're going
267640	273480	to be like a, like a meaning crisis of, is there some kind of ground to stand on? Are
273480	279680	we just on this kind of slippery, illusory, hollow sensation of progress towards some
279680	286040	technological financial gain, like towards what? And I think it's interesting that within
286040	292040	like disease or dis-ease, you know, probably a hundred percent of diseases or there's
292040	298160	some root of stress involved in that somewhere in the system. And we can address that
298160	303120	topically or allopathically and say, aha, here, here is the tumor, but then you can wind it
303120	308360	back. And, you know, at some point, there's, there's something to cause friction in the
308360	314680	system to eventually manifest as some type of, you know, physical expression of disease. And
314680	318680	so when the majority of people that are visiting a hospital are there for something that's
318720	323800	stress related or something that's like psychosomatic, mental, emotional, you know,
323800	328520	lifestyle related or something that would just pass on its own, but we're seeking out for this
328520	334680	pill or solution, at the root there, I feel like we can start to address some of our medical
335080	341840	experiences through like these, this internal lens, you know, and through starting to establish,
342360	346040	you know, maybe starting to address that, like that, that, that meaning crisis that, that I
346040	350920	personally experience, you know, I feel like many other people resonate with that. So what do you,
350920	356920	what do you think about that? Like that, that, that internal experience, eventually expressing
356920	365240	out into, you know, a physical manifestation and some path maybe towards like finding relationship
365240	371000	or balance or homeostasis between the two, the internal and the external, I guess, is maybe
371000	375160	like why I was, I wanted to have this conversation with you. Yeah. I think you're right. I think
375160	380760	that you definitely, the idea that there is a relationship between, let's say our own inner
380760	387480	direction and our exterior manifestations in the body is definitely something which happens.
387480	394600	I think the mistake that we make, especially us today, is that we, we look for, we think that
394600	399240	we're going to find that in some kind of like comfort, like we think we're going to find that in
399240	405720	some kind of, you know, if I could just be relaxed enough, if I could just rest enough, if I could
405720	412200	just, you know, let's say, serve myself enough, like if I could take care of my needs, you know,
412200	417800	I need to, I need some me time, like that's the, that's the, the, the modern way of looking at it,
417800	424680	that actually accentuates the problem. And it, I think that the, the more ancient solution would
424760	429960	have been something like give yourself. If you give yourself, then a lot of those other things,
430680	436600	they tend to diminish. Not that you won't be sick, maybe you will, but it won't matter so much,
436600	441640	because you'll be living, you'll be living a purposeful life and you'll be living towards,
441640	446200	towards, because what do you do, what do you want? You just want to live until you're 99 years old and
446200	451080	be miserable, you know, and internally and be physically, you could be physically fit and
451160	456760	kind of looking to be relaxed and to, to live as long as possible. Or it seems like the,
456760	461480	the more ancient vision is something like give yourself. If you give yourself, then you actually
461480	465880	might have a very short life. You might have a very short and painful life, but that short and
465880	471800	painful life will be bright. It'll be shining. And look at the people that we admire. Like we,
471800	477160	we, we don't admire, we admire people that have done that, right? Those are the people that shine
477240	483240	to us. Like, like stars, people who, who give themselves for a cause, who give themselves to
483240	487560	others, you know, they become something else. And so the image that we have, for example,
487560	493320	Christianity is actually the opposite of it's, it really is the image of someone who's willing
493320	499160	to die for his friends, who's willing to die for others. That is actually what brings the real
499160	504760	balance. But I, but I do feel like right now we have a kind of weird twisted version of that,
504760	510280	which is trying to heal my own, all my own issues, like heal my stuff. And then,
510280	514360	then I'll find homeostasis. But yeah, there's a book I've mentioned here a bunch of times called
514360	520120	whatever you think, think the opposite by Paul Arden. I think that's comes up in what you're
520120	528760	saying now. I think it is like, you would, I would think that by focusing on the individual,
528760	535400	the individual will start to get, you know, become more and more robust and, and like well
535400	542200	developed and complex and content, you know, and all of those things. But in fact, it takes
543000	550040	like relinquishing the attachment to the self in order to come back around and heal the self
550040	555160	and like grow the self. So it's like in the forgetting of the self, the self is actually
556040	560840	has the spaciousness to, to grow and heal and do all the things. Whereas when there's excessive
560840	566120	focus on the self and losing that connection outward, then it's like, I feel like the self
566120	572200	like suffocates on itself. Yeah, but there is like, there is a possibility of practicing,
573160	578280	of practicing doing certain practices, you know, on yourself, with yourself, like meditation prayer,
578920	583240	some kind of a schesis, you know, when you, and I think people who also do physical activity
583240	587880	have a different version of that, which is that you feel your limit, you know, you feel your limit
587880	592680	constantly, and you're trying to push further than your limit. Those are, those are practices that
592680	599160	can actually help you understand how it works. Like it's not about, it's not, it's not comfort
599160	604200	doesn't give meaning at all. Like, you know, feeling good about yourself is not, is not the
604200	611000	way to go. People are going to hate hearing that. But actually trying to, anything that makes you
611000	616520	transcend yourself is going to start with pain. It's going to start with a sense of disease,
616520	623080	exactly a disease in general. Like I am, I'm not where I should be. I need, I need, I need to, to,
623080	627320	to kind of move in the right direction. Of course, we can beat ourselves up too. And that's not
627320	631240	helpful. Usually beating ourselves up for not being where we want to be is another kind of
631240	636920	weird self centered thing. Like it's a weird kind of a kind of moving it back, moving into
636920	641720	experience and just feeling sorry for yourself or feeling guilty all the time. That's probably not,
641720	645800	that's not the right way to go about it either. But you do need to feel some pain in order to
645800	650760	move towards meaning. Yeah, they're so back to Viveki, something that I learned from him as the,
650760	657640	the origin of the word religion is religio or something of the sort. And it means to bind
657640	664280	or to bring together, like to unite, which is also the origin of the word yoga, yoke union
664280	670680	connection. I mean, it's like it like spans across so many different ideologies, this idea of like
670680	679720	connection. Yeah. And so I feel like the word religion, the word God, the word spirit, spirituality,
679720	687400	all of those have so many meanings and kind of like these crusty old barnacles attached to them.
687400	691800	Yeah. And so that like at the, at the, at the root of most of those words is like, oh, it's pretty
691800	702040	good. It's valuable. But then the outside, there's just a lot of flaky. Yeah, a lot of flakes attached
702040	706520	to it. I totally agree. And now, and now it's, now there's a confusion for the flake for the actual,
706520	712360	like the root. No, you're right. And it's, and it's actually the fault, a lot of it is the fault
712360	717560	of the religious people, where they started, I think there was a lot of forgetting, like just a
717560	722360	forgetting of what all this stuff is about. And it becoming more and more arbitrary in the modern
722360	727800	world. As people became materialists, it's as if a lot of this stuff became arbitrary. So it was
727800	736040	like, you're a Christian, so you believe that some guy died on a cross, and now you're going to go to
736040	741160	heaven. If you believe that, that's, that's what, that's what a Christian is, really? Like, that's
741160	747720	it? That's pathetic. That's really lame, if that's what it is. But it was really, it's really cute.
747720	752840	It's like childish, right? It's like, like really beautiful, actually. It's like, wow, like you are
752840	759000	a 50 year old woman or man. And this is like a Disney, which, you know, I think there's a lot of
759000	764360	meaning in, in fictional novels and tales and all that stuff. And they're, they're relating back to
764360	770600	that core root truth, typically. But it's, I mean, I think it's not, not having like a pessimistic
770600	775560	feeling of like, oh my God, I can't believe it. It's also kind of like, wow, that's amazing. Like,
775560	782280	I find that beautiful. Well, I mean, I think that for a lot of people, having that maybe that simple
782280	788840	faith could probably be totally fine. But it also, there also needs to be, there needs to be an
788840	794120	intellectual version of that. And it has always existed. It was always there. If you read the
794120	797720	early church fathers, you read the mystics, like it's all there. It's just that a lot of it has
797720	802280	been forgotten. And it's interesting, because right now there's an interesting moment, like people
802280	808440	like John Revecki are part of that, where because of the space, because of the space where cognitive
808440	814600	science is now introducing itself into the discourse, and we realize that we can't escape
814600	820520	perception, like we can't escape this experience of the world, and that we can't pretend like it's
820520	825160	not there and just talk about science as if it's outside of that. So coming back to this experience
825160	831240	and this experience of quality of this experience of, you know, of patterns and of embodiment,
832040	836600	then we can start to realize what religion is. Again, we can start to understand it, that we can
836600	842600	we can see that the world presents itself as so multifaceted, that unless we have things which
842600	849560	bind phenomena together, then everything scatters, especially at the human level. If we don't have
849640	856440	ritualization, we don't have story, we don't have orders, which bind even yourself, like your
856440	863480	own personal self, and your family, and then you scale that up, you know, cosmically, then the
863480	869320	world doesn't exist. And then you realize, oh, well, that's what religion is. It's the it's the
869320	874040	man in which things bind together that ends up looking like ritual, it ends up looking like
874040	877880	story, it ends up looking like all the things what people think are silly and superstitious.
878440	883480	But actually without them, reality scatters, and you can you can apply to your life, you realize
883480	887800	actually that most of the things you do are ritualized, and there's nothing superstitious
887800	892600	about them, like brushing your teeth is a ritualized act towards a purpose. But you have
892600	899160	ritualized acts towards purposes that are higher than just getting your teeth clean, that are about
899160	904440	how can we bind together as a group, how can we recognize what it is that we have in common?
905000	909000	And then it looks like processions, it looks like circumambulation, it looks like
909000	915080	singing together, it looks like all these things which which the modern person found silly,
915720	922120	they kind of flow back in. I feel like there can be like, I mean, like you're saying like you can't
922120	926920	escape religion, you can't escape dogma, we didn't say you can't, you can't even say exactly, but
926920	934040	I imagine you probably align with that to some degree, or maybe not. But so today, you can see
934120	939960	Christianity seems at least in my bubble of a world that I exist in, seems to be waning
939960	945240	popularity of it. You know, there's a lot more like spirituality in quotations. There's like,
945240	949320	we're certainly worshiping, you know, we worship our cell phones, we worship our
950520	957160	notifications, we worship our financial status, we worship our socio economic status where we're
957160	962440	at on the ladder, you know, so we're like, we're worshiping a lot, a lot, maybe more than ever,
962520	970760	really. As far as like compulsive worship, we might be at the highest, you know, not that it's a
970760	976680	competition, but we may be at like the highest state of worship ever, at least from the lens of
976680	981720	like compulsive worship. Yeah, but there's also, there's also prescribed, there's also like prescribed
981720	987000	worship, which is actually pretty strong right now, people don't really realize it, but you know,
987880	994200	it's just because people have separated the notion of religion from other ritualized aspects of
994200	999400	their life. But if, for example, you realize, you could say that recycling is a form of worship,
999400	1006680	you know, because you are ritually acting in a way which is prescribed to you from above,
1007320	1013000	in order to participate in a story and a purpose together. And so we all, you know,
1013000	1018280	on one day, this day a week, we all put out our separated materials or whatever. And so
1018280	1023400	there is a ritualized procession about that, which is similar to a religious procession,
1023400	1027320	it's just that it's ordered towards something else. And you can say what's different because
1027320	1031800	that's really valuable, like saving the environment is really valuable. And I would say, yeah,
1031800	1038280	you're right, saving the environment is really valuable. But us binding together, let's say,
1038360	1045160	under the transcendent source of love is probably pretty valuable too, right? It probably has a
1045160	1053000	value that is powerful as well. So I think we can re-understand a lot of the practices of our
1053000	1059880	ancestors, even if we're able to notice, like you said, that we worship. And the problem is exactly
1059880	1064680	what you said is that addiction is a form of worship, especially addiction. It's one of the
1064680	1068520	most easy. If you want to understand worship, like addiction is one of the best ways because
1068520	1075400	it's a ritualized cycle of attention, you know, and you get possessed by it. And it actually ends up,
1076120	1082360	let's say, reorganizing your life around its attention, right, around its existence. And so
1082360	1089960	it actually uses you as a body in order to make sure that you are sacrificing and propitiating to
1090600	1096440	this God. But you can see how it's like a demon, right? It's like a parasitic God, you could say.
1096440	1102760	It's a God that actually ultimately wants to destroy you. But it can help you understand
1102760	1107560	what worship is, which is that when we would do that, like if a person would go through the beads
1107560	1115080	of their prayer rope or whatever, that's similar in terms of this binded attention,
1115080	1121400	which is ritualized in order to get you somewhere. Yeah, there's a quote from Alan Watts. I mean,
1121400	1127000	I think it's from Alan Watts. I've heard it from Alan Watts. They said that we're confusing the
1127000	1135960	menus for the meal. And so we're eating, you know, the words duck confit, you know, like chewing on
1135960	1142600	the paper duck confit. But there's no like fat, you know, an omega threes and like there's just
1142600	1148760	not there's no calories there. Yeah. And so that's the reason that that that quote's coming to mind
1148760	1153720	is like, I wonder if there is some hierarchy of worship. I think often as we can romanticize
1153720	1158600	the ancients, you know, and romanticize hunter gatherers and like everything we're doing now is
1158600	1166600	wrong. Yeah, everything that happened yesterday was the way. It's like, what is like, is there like
1166600	1171640	some ultimate absolute better, you know, or is there like, how do we parse apart like where is
1171640	1176120	the menu? Where is the meal? Does it matter in the first place? Are we all just going to end up in
1176120	1181320	the same place anyway? Yeah, well, I think there is. I think there's an objective, I think there's
1181320	1186760	an objective hierarchy of worship for sure. And you can actually see it kind of playing itself out
1186760	1192920	in the story of religion or the man in which religion developed through the centuries. And it
1192920	1198040	does have to do with understanding where the good lies, you could say, what is it, the good that
1198040	1206360	binds us? What is it? You know, and I would say that it moves towards something like love, towards
1206360	1211960	something like compassion, self giving or self sacrifice. And I think that you can find that,
1211960	1215640	you know, of course in Christianity, but I think you see some of that in Buddhism, although it's
1215640	1222120	not personalized so much in Buddhism. But you do find this idea that the highest, let's say the
1222120	1227960	highest value, the thing that should bind us together is actually paradoxically a giving away,
1227960	1235080	like it's a self emptying. And this self emptying becomes the thing which makes it possible for
1235080	1243000	us to exist as more than just these selfish little beings. And so I think that that is a
1243000	1247800	true hierarchy of being. And so you can imagine local gods, for example, in the time of hunter
1247800	1252680	gatherers that had some function and some power over the group and would bind them together,
1252680	1257800	would give them a totem, would give them some type of identity and characteristics that they could,
1257800	1264200	that they could celebrate and participate in. But ultimately, that leads to constant war,
1264200	1269560	like it just leads to nonstop war. Because you're, you're, these gods are fighting in the heavens,
1269560	1273560	right? These different gods, these different totems and gods are fighting amongst each other.
1273560	1277960	As the tribes fight and are constantly at war, we always forget that the Greeks,
1277960	1284200	even though they saw themselves as being one people, they were always fighting nonstop. Every
1284200	1289720	year, people would go to war. So the idea of binding towards higher goods, I think is something
1289720	1296920	which happened for a reason. As far as like making this conversation actionable towards some,
1296920	1303080	you know, directionality in one's life, something that I think I could use more of,
1303080	1307320	and me being like a product of the culture that I've been, you know, grown in.
1309480	1312760	I've heard you mentioned before, and then it caused me to look it up that the
1312760	1317560	Plato's transcendentals, the three transcendentals is beauty, goodness and truth is what I've
1317560	1326760	read on the internet. And that I think is something that is, is kind of can easily be
1326760	1332520	forgotten in the modern era, to pick on the modern era. You know, and that's like I just
1332520	1337000	got back from Greece, thankfully, it was really like an exceptional experience. And we went to
1337000	1342040	various different islands there and, you know, learned about the God of Sculpeyus, the God of
1342040	1347480	medicine and the way that they approached medicine. And the way that they approached medicine, one
1347480	1354120	theaters were, were built beside or very close to hospitals, which I thought was very interesting.
1354120	1359960	So that concept of theater was like an entrenched within medicine. And when you enter into the
1359960	1365320	hospital, it was, it was really beautiful. And there was, there was art, and you'd get into,
1365320	1369640	you know, a body of water and you, you know, cold plunge and hot tub. And, you know, there was,
1369640	1377480	it was, and what that, the way that the tour guides described to me was through art that,
1377560	1384840	like that, that the emotive power of art and also senses, you know, so like Tantra in a way,
1384840	1390360	you could say maybe that kind of softens up and opens up some space within, like the tour guide
1390360	1394440	said, like the soul, you know, so whatever, whatever word you want to put that deeper part.
1395160	1402840	And I feel like in the modern era, there's a bit of a jump to just what is the physical
1402840	1408520	expression. Now let's like attack that physical expression, as opposed to allowing spaciousness
1409080	1414840	and using some of these softer tactics to kind of go through and, and, and open up some space to be
1414840	1421880	able to get into like what night, what lies beneath that outer physical expression. So that's
1421880	1427800	something I think that was very wordy. But essentially, the question or curiosity is, is
1428760	1434440	from your perception, what do you see that the value in Plato's three transcendentals,
1434440	1441320	beauty, goodness and truth in supporting us as modern people, at least from like a medical
1441320	1447000	perspective? I think you're definitely onto something and you, you understand, it's a good
1447000	1453160	way to understand the moment in which we are now, that is, right now, we, we have the, we have exactly
1453160	1457800	this idea that if we're treating the, the body, like if someone's sick, we're just going to treat
1457800	1465640	the body. So we bring someone to horrendous place, like our horrendous place of fluorescent lights,
1465640	1472920	you know, and, and green plastic things and, you know, and metal bars that metal beds that
1472920	1481640	look like prison bars. And that's where we bring people to heal because crazy. We think that it's
1481640	1486360	like, well, it's just, it's just like, it's just a car, right? We're just fixing a car.
1486360	1489240	So we're going to, we're going to bring someone, we're going to, we're going to put them in
1489240	1492920	the rooms with several people, and we're going to, we're going to embarrass them, have them,
1492920	1498200	you know, wear these horrible nightgowns or whatever. Like everything about it is this
1498200	1506360	reduction of the human person to, to a machine. And that's exactly the problem. That's exactly
1506360	1511000	the problem that, that we mentioned a little earlier, which is that with the return of something
1511080	1518040	like cognitive science, we're realizing that no, you can't pretend like there is no experience of
1518040	1524200	the world and that that experience of the world doesn't participate in, in your, in, in, in,
1524200	1529160	in the medical, in your healing. Like the, for example, the placebo effect is a great example,
1529160	1535160	right? So we believe every medical doctor believes that there's a placebo effect to medicine,
1535800	1542520	but they try to reduce that effect as much as possible because they want to reduce you to a
1542520	1549080	machine. And if you could prove that augmenting the placebo effect could actually help you heal
1549080	1556600	faster, they don't care because they don't like that idea. They don't like the idea that, that
1556600	1562440	mind, that experience participates in, in your, in your experience. And so when they look at
1562440	1567640	ancient medicine and they see the ritualization, they see the drama, like you said, in, in relationship
1567640	1573560	to the medical practice, they think it's all hocus pocus nonsense, but they still believe that
1573560	1578920	there's, that there's a placebo effect. It's hilarious. It's like, why wouldn't you, why
1578920	1586600	couldn't you use the best of medicine and then create a ritualized drama of practice in which
1586680	1593560	you would enter into the medical relationship as, you know, as a, like you said, like as a, as a
1593560	1599400	being and counting beauty, it's not possible. Like our world is too gone, at least for now,
1599400	1604760	it's too gone for that. So we're stuck with these horrible cement parking garages that are called
1604760	1610680	hospitals. Yeah, I wonder anytime someone uses the, the term they, I always, my mind always
1610680	1616680	jumps to like, who is they? And then also want is another curiosity. Like I don't know that
1616680	1622920	I'd love for you to define they in, in relation to that statement. And then also drawing back on,
1622920	1631960	on want. So they want to reduce us to a machine. It feels to me kind of just like it is reducing
1632840	1639480	itself to a machine. So what is the it now in this way? It would be the zeitgeist,
1639480	1643320	like the totality of culture moving together. And then we have these individual nodes that
1643320	1647400	pop up and they're wearing, you know, a lab coat and their names, Dr. Sanders or whatever.
1647400	1652760	All right, so let's, let's, let's frame it this way. So the movement, the same movement which
1652760	1661640	moved against religio and described religio as being hocus pocus magic and, and superstition
1662600	1669880	and ridiculous things people did or things people did that were imposed by power and, and, and
1669880	1675640	and patriarchy or whatever, however you want to describe it, this, the same, let's say narrative,
1675640	1680520	you could call it like the worst of the enlightenment narrative, the worst of the, of the
1680520	1687640	materialist scientific narrative that narrative leads at the same time to parking garage hospitals.
1688520	1694200	You know, because, because there's a coherence in the reduction of everything to its material
1694200	1700440	causes that brings about, you know, the, the, the, the medical establishment that we're,
1700440	1704840	that we're dealing with. And so it's, of course, it's a side effect. Like I don't think that
1705400	1709880	Locke and Hobbs thought that we would get to where we are. I don't think that they would,
1709880	1716760	that they, that they could have predicted that their ideas about, about rationality and Occam's
1716760	1721400	razor and, you know, there's these scientific revolutions that we went through would lead us
1721400	1730600	to a kind of dehumanized machine body. But that is what happened in the, in those causes.
1732520	1737320	But like I said, I do think so it's, you're right, when I say they, I don't mean, I can't, I can't,
1737320	1741160	it's not the doctors, it's not their fault. It's not, it's not the, it's not even the medical
1741160	1748920	establishment's fault at this point. But it is a movement, like it is a, it is a line that you
1748920	1753400	can draw from certain changes which happened in history, which brought us to this point.
1754440	1763000	But at the same time, I do think that seeing that now, there are possibilities of, of alternatives.
1763000	1767240	It's harder in the medical world, but there are other places where you can, where you can,
1767240	1772120	where someone can do that. For example, the same thing with schools, like schools are basically,
1772120	1776760	you know, they're factories for children, like they're, they're just factories pumping out children
1776760	1784280	into the world. Now that, there's a place where you can, where someone can find better alternatives,
1784280	1790840	you know, homeschool, private schools, whatever, schools that are more integrative and integrate
1791400	1797160	storytelling and culture and ritual and practice into, into a child's life rather than just have
1797160	1804440	them go through the system. But medical stuff is harder because it's so, so big and there's such a,
1805480	1811720	yeah. And there's also cranks, like that, a real cranks that exist in that, in that world of healing
1811720	1818040	too. It feels to me when I say like the they and like, you know, the it and all that as opposed to,
1818040	1822280	to personalizing an individual, having any type of intention, which that's a question
1822920	1828360	I have as, as well as like how much sovereignty do we have in our choices? And how much are we just
1828360	1832680	a part of this collective consciousness? And we're just, you know, a barrel of water just sloshing
1832680	1839560	about, you know, within that, if we are just this sloshing, sloshing barrel of water really works as
1839560	1844120	an analogy, but I'll try to force it. No, but I said what you mean, like we're just in the current,
1844120	1851000	like we're just going down stream. And there's not much we can do, we can notice that this isn't
1851080	1857080	pleasant, but it's not easy to understand how to go, how to go upstream. Like it's just not that
1857080	1866040	simple. Yeah. And so it feels to me like perhaps since the, at one point there was more, you know,
1866040	1872840	nature worship and animism and, and, you know, probably more like matriarchal societies were
1872840	1879000	more common and things of the sort. And then there was a shift. So the, the metaphoric
1879880	1887640	water sloshing about going to one side. And then I feel like, you know, I'll say like maybe Cartesian
1887640	1892920	times or Newtonian times and kind of entering into like, aha, no, like scientism. This is the
1892920	1898040	solution, you know, and pragmatism and everything needs to be rationalized. And I need to be able
1898040	1905240	to hold it and measure it. And that is truth. I don't know that culture as a whole is like, aha,
1905240	1910280	like, yes, I think it's, it feels to me kind of, it's just like a pendulum swinging. And right now
1910280	1915000	we're kind of, I don't know where we're at. If it is a pendulum swinging, I don't know where on the
1915000	1923880	swing we are, but we're certainly in some pragmatic reductionist rational swing phase. And it feels
1923960	1930520	like there's a yearning to kind of find some center or maybe wildly swing back to the other side.
1931160	1935560	Yeah. Well, there's, you could, I think you could see the extremes at the same time. So I think
1936200	1942120	that's probably the best way to understand, especially the modern, like the modern world
1942120	1946920	is to understand it as extremes manifesting themselves. There is a bit of a pendulum, but
1946920	1952200	you can also see it happening at the same time. So if you look at the, in the rationalism right
1952200	1956760	after the rational, like the hyper-rationalist phase was romanticism and symbolism and the
1956760	1964200	kind of degenerate symbolic thinking that we saw, you know, in the 18th, 19th century,
1964200	1970440	which was about fantastical imagination, all that stuff, you know, and the occultism that came
1970440	1975880	with that type of thinking as well. So if you look at the modern world is both the rationalism,
1975880	1981880	hyper-rationalism and all that stuff, but it's also like weird occultism and, you know,
1981880	1988360	Crowley and the return of witchcraft and Lovatsky and Theosophy and all that kind of,
1988920	1994360	that other side of modernity, which happens at the same time. So right now we could see that
1994360	1999720	the internet is a great example. The internet is a mix of hyper-rationality and control and,
1999720	2006280	you know, like furry avatars in the metaverse, which is like complete explosion of rationality
2006280	2015160	into idiosyncrasy in ways that you could never, ever imagine in the past. Like you can be anything
2015160	2021240	that you can possibly imagine in the metaverse, but that's also, that's happening at the same
2021240	2027160	time as this hyper-rational kind of strange control. And so I think that's probably the best
2027160	2031480	way because it's hard to, it would be hard to understand our moment if we didn't see those
2031480	2035960	two things happening at the same time. And I'd like to at some point probably try to draw back
2035960	2041160	to some kind of like ashmole, what can we do type scenario. But something that I was listening to
2041160	2047000	your podcast with Makayla Peterson in preparation to this one. And one of the things that I heard
2047000	2053000	her saying throughout that seemed like she was kind of like at least acknowledging with herself
2053000	2060200	historically speaking, and seems like a little bit present as well, leaning towards like rationality
2060200	2065560	and logic and pragmatism as like a safe haven. And I think that that's very common. Like I can,
2065560	2071320	I can notice that with myself. And I think many, many people we can oftentimes not projecting
2071320	2076040	any of this on hers or something I noticed now, like just back to speaking about me. I think I
2076040	2084600	can lean on pragmatism as a way because I feel like there's almost like a fear of chaos.
2086200	2089640	And that deeper underpart, you know, like there's a quote that I
2090520	2094840	from Marianne Williamson, who I've also had on here. So our deepest fear is not
2094840	2098200	that we are inadequate, our deepest fears that we are powerful beyond measure.
2099160	2104040	And I feel like that, that undercurrent, that underpart that sometimes I think in this,
2104040	2110520	in this modern era, that's kind of, it can be like masked by rationale and science and logic
2110520	2115240	and imperial research. And it's not a thing until it's been studied and all the peers have reviewed
2115240	2121080	it. And then we can start to like actually have a conversation. But there's also this welling,
2121080	2129480	this well beneath that it's like, oh, like, perhaps access to, you know, all the power and
2129480	2135240	answers to, you know, every, everything you could possibly imagine. But I feel like there's a little
2135240	2141080	bit almost like of a, for me, I can notice like, like almost like a fear or resistance around that
2141080	2147160	part. And so I'll just lean on science and lean on rationality and lean on, you know, because I
2147160	2153720	don't want to kind of touch the chaos of what's inside. Yeah, but I also think that it's important,
2153720	2158360	this is something that is difficult because unions are popular right now, I guess, in part because
2158360	2164360	of Jordan Peterson. But there's a tendency to confuse two things, like there's, there's a
2164360	2171080	trans rational space. And there's a pre rational space or, you know, there's something like this
2171720	2175560	subconscious, you could say, there's something like super consciousness and those,
2176360	2182120	they can look the same to people that are just trapped in consciousness. But if you read any
2182120	2188680	traditional text from any religion, they clearly demarcate those as not being the same. And so
2188680	2196920	the kind of chaos, the dream kind of chaos that that kind of emotional, romantic feeling that you
2196920	2205800	get is not the same as the sense that things culminate into a unity, which is beyond the
2205800	2212280	particulars, right, that there's this drive up towards something which is pulling me beyond
2212280	2218440	the world. Now, I understand why it can seem like sometimes it's the same in your experience, but
2219240	2225160	there's a, you could understand the rationality or the rational world is, is this like buffered
2225160	2231000	space that exists between those two poles, something which is pulling you up towards,
2231880	2238360	you could say the way to understand it would be that as an individual, for example, right,
2238360	2245080	if you give yourself to a higher cause, right, that higher cause is not in the individual,
2245080	2251880	it's not, it's not there. So if you take the world of the individual and you analyze it every
2251880	2257000	single aspect of it, you're never going to get the highest cause to which you're willing to sacrifice
2257000	2263480	yourself for. Does that make sense? And so now think of that for everything, like there's a world
2263480	2269480	of structured causality, but that world of structured causality gives itself up towards
2270600	2276200	higher participations, you could say. And then there's also a way in which it dissolves into
2276200	2281720	nothingness. So you as an individual, let's say the manner in which you could dissolve into all
2281720	2286920	kinds of idiosyncratic bad habits or passions or the way you could become obsessed with things and
2287000	2291480	kind of devolve into something which is not rational at all, right? It's like there's nothing,
2292760	2297720	if you, once, if you analyze you becoming addicted to things, you realize this is not
2297720	2303400	rational. Like this is, this is, this is breaking me apart. It's fragmenting me completely. But
2303400	2308440	that is different from this giving up, you could say, the way in which you participate. I don't
2308440	2313560	know if that makes sense. It's important, I think, because people are right now are so confused. They
2313560	2317800	think that spirituality is, sometimes they think that spirituality is this lower stuff
2317800	2324280	down here. Like it's about feeling and about, you know, how I, you know, how I, how I feel about
2324280	2329400	myself or how I feel about others or these like, these kind of vague intuitions that you get about,
2329400	2337320	about, about things. But the world, the higher world or the world of spiritual participation is
2337880	2345000	in some ways it, it's trans-rational. But once you grasp it, it's super clear. Like it's,
2345640	2350920	right? It's like the clearest thing you'll ever see. It appears as a, as a beacon of, of light
2350920	2356600	that's kind of guiding you beyond your limited world. Yeah. The, the only issue I have with
2356600	2362840	the idea of like higher and, and lower and placing a hierarchy on states of consciousness and like
2362840	2370920	aspects of, I don't know, existence life is, I think there can be a fragmentation or divorcing
2370920	2375960	or separation within self through that separation and the idea that something is higher than something
2375960	2382840	else. I understand why you say that, but it's also because this is the issue, the problem of
2383400	2389080	like equalizing everything is that hierarchies don't compete with their levels. That is that
2389160	2395480	if you are a healthy individual and all your thoughts and your passions are joined together,
2397160	2403880	then you will actually become the best part of a higher participation. So you will actually be a
2403880	2411000	better member of your family if you are united in that, in the, in the individual part. And so
2411000	2415000	it doesn't compete. That's what cults do. Cults, you want to know the difference between a real
2415000	2422760	religion and a cult? A cult will try to compete with lower levels of participation. Like a cult
2422760	2428360	will say you have to deny your family. You have to deny all these lower participation. And so it's
2428360	2433800	the same with like a, it's the same with any hierarchy of, of anything, right? So if you,
2435080	2443400	if you understand, for example, that love is the highest virtue, right? And so you can also
2443400	2449000	understand that being good at something at a lower scale, it doesn't compete with that. So you could
2449000	2453560	be good at your job, but that if you're good at your job, I don't know, like if you're good at,
2454200	2460840	at making shoes, it's like that good can embed itself in love because you can do it in a way
2460840	2464760	that serves your community or you could do it in a way that's selfish and is just to fill your
2464760	2471320	pockets. But, but there's a manner in which those goods that scale up, they actually don't compete
2471320	2477240	with each other. They fit into each other like of this beautiful fractal dance, right? Everything
2477240	2482840	kind of embeds itself into, into the rest. They're probably some way to literally define
2483560	2488680	the experience of love being like a higher vibratory state. And then within that, it's like,
2490440	2497000	maybe, maybe you could relate it to like spectrums of light. And there's been kind of a war against
2497000	2500840	blue light recently. I don't know if you, if you pay attention to things of this sort, like
2502120	2505720	yeah, exactly, exactly, like where your blue blockers, you know, like the blue light, it's
2505720	2512120	bad, you know, and it's like, no, no, no, no, it's not bad. It's just one frequency that serves a
2512120	2519800	purpose. It's just serves a purpose at, at specific time for specific functions, you know, and so
2519800	2525400	low, low frequency light and that, you know, infrareds and reds and oranges and all that stuff
2525400	2532120	incredibly valuable. Really high frequency light, you know, the blues and all that, like that's like
2532120	2539000	really valuable. And when, if we're playing the game where like, oh, I'm, I'm tribe blue light and
2539000	2543800	like, no, no, no, I'm tribe orange light or red light, you know, this is better. It's more healthy.
2543800	2550200	It's like, well, the, the, going back to like the original derivative of health, health comes back to
2550280	2556440	wholeness. So again, like all of this comes back to like, okay, how do we get, if, if what one's
2556440	2562600	intention is a sensation, probably of, I don't know, like cellular function, you know, and, and
2563240	2570440	satisfaction, probably the conjoining of all of the tribes and being able to actually be able to see
2571160	2577160	that there really is value in, in all of it and not kind of casting any of it out, but actually
2577240	2580440	coming through, I'm kind of going out into the weeds here, but I think, I think there's the
2580440	2587320	availability to perceive everything through that lens of, of love and acceptance, but not necessarily
2587320	2592440	swallow the pill entirely and say, okay, I'm going to see this state or frequency or whatever
2592440	2596440	through love and acceptance. So I'm just going to become that and that is all of me. Like I'm able
2596440	2604600	to actually absorb and be with all things, but not get trapped in the kind of the tribalistic
2605560	2609800	thing that tends to happen where we start to create more segregation, more isolation,
2609800	2615480	and then oftentimes it's in the guise of some higher power. The idea, so in Dante, for example,
2615480	2622600	you see the way that he presents things is perfect. He says that all, let's say, all sin is something
2622600	2630520	like misplaced love or too much love or too little love or not, or love that is kind of twisted.
2630520	2637160	And so the idea is that all things are good if they're properly aligned. Like nothing is bad
2637160	2641160	in itself. That's ridiculous. Like it's not a, that's definitely not a Christian way of seeing
2641160	2646440	the world. All things are good and that they just have to be in their proper place. So the
2646440	2651080	urinality of light is a good example. Like, well, obviously, blue light isn't bad. It's, it's just
2651080	2658120	that it has to, it has to be in the proper proportion for what a human being is. And you
2658600	2664280	could say that about things that are maybe, maybe more human, for example. So you could imagine
2664280	2670440	something like entertainment is, is entertainment good or is entertainment bad? And you could say,
2670440	2676360	well, entertainment is good if it's in the proper proportion to other things in your life that are,
2676360	2682920	that are aimed towards, towards bringing all things together in the good. But if you live a
2682920	2688680	life of just entertainment, right? It's like saying is eating dessert bad? It's not bad if,
2689400	2695960	if it's properly ordered, but if you just eat dessert nonstop, then you're going to get sick.
2695960	2699880	Like it's actually going to affect you. And if you just spend your whole day watching movies and
2699880	2704840	playing video games, then it's actually going to, it's actually going to affect you. But the other
2704840	2709080	one is true as well. Right? If you spend your whole day working, if you spend your whole day
2709080	2714760	doing whatever it is that you do without giving room for the things that are, that are also good,
2714760	2719240	then you will, then you, you'll have the same problem from the other side. Well, you're,
2719240	2724280	you're going to become like someone who's super strict with themselves that doesn't leave any
2724280	2730360	room for some play, let's say in terms of personal discipline, is going to crack. Like they're just,
2730360	2736360	at some point they crack and they, they, they kind of collapse. Yeah. There's another, I'll be less
2736360	2740280	quotacious after this, I think, but there's another quote from Victor Frankel. He said,
2741240	2745080	something like paraphrase, some long lines of, of those who lack purpose will seek
2745080	2750440	pleasure instead as like a replacement. And I think that kind of turns into like this,
2750440	2755960	this like hungry ghost type sensation, like this ongoing reaching out for those little hits.
2757400	2760840	Yeah. Now, because there's that, that lack of foundation of like
2761560	2766840	actually feeling held and supported in a part of a fabric of something bigger than just this self.
2767400	2771880	Yeah. Well, you could say that that's the, so the drug epidemic in the, in the North America is,
2772600	2778120	seems to be really a product of the meaning crisis, like a product of people not having
2778120	2783720	direction and purpose. And so kind of spiraling into exactly what you said into this,
2785000	2789320	this more and more extreme desire to, to, to feel something, you know.
2789320	2791080	Yeah, we just want to feel. Yeah.
2792040	2795400	How do you, how are you with feeling? Do you feel like, where are you with all these
2795400	2801320	conversations? Like, do you, do you have like a, like any type of, of like,
2801320	2805800	unquenched yearning sensations that, that I experienced, for example?
2805800	2811000	Oh, of course. I think that's really part of being human, you know? I mean, it's just,
2811000	2817080	of course that happens. And, and I think that it's also, if you're conscious about it and you're
2817080	2823400	aware of it, then you can also realize what it is that, what that's for. Now, I think especially
2823400	2829560	sexual desire, the thing that once we, you know, one of the things that happened, right,
2829560	2834440	in the sixties and then ongoing from there, but there were ways of that before and kind of decadent
2834440	2840600	end of century times is that we had this sense that if we could just satisfy our sexual desires
2840600	2845560	and proclivities, then, you know, everybody would get along and we'd all be happy. But it turns out
2845560	2853400	that if you focus on that, then it's an unlimited source of frustration because your desires just
2853400	2858920	get more and more idiosyncratic and bigger and bigger and more and more, you know, you need more
2858920	2863000	in order to feel, it's almost like it's the same as drugs. Like, it's like, you need more
2863000	2868760	in order to feel taken further, you could say. The hedonic, the hedonic treadmill.
2868760	2873480	Exactly. And so if, what, but if you realize that, then you're like, okay, well, you know,
2874440	2879960	how am I going to deal with this? Right? So this, so for example, marriage is a good way to do it
2879960	2884280	because it's hard to do it on your own. It's really hard because it's like, but if you're married to
2884280	2891960	someone that you love, that person will act as both a, to take a place for your sexual desire,
2891960	2896280	but also a limit to your sexual desire because it's one person. And it's like,
2897240	2901880	that person has a limit. Like they have a sexual, they have, especially, especially for men, like
2901960	2905160	if you're married to a woman, like that woman has a certain limit at some point, it's going to
2905160	2910120	start manifesting itself. And so then you were like, okay, so that feeling, then you feel it,
2910120	2916520	right? Then you feel that, you feel that longing or you feel that lack or that whole that it's
2916520	2921560	causing in you. And then you can realize too, but you can realize that actually the problem
2921560	2926440	is that the sex doesn't fill that hole. It's, it's fine. There's nothing wrong with sex. Like,
2926520	2932040	sex is great, but it's never going to fill that hole completely because that hole keeps getting
2932040	2936360	bigger for some reason. It just keeps getting, or more weird and more, you know, idiosyncratic.
2936920	2941720	And so that's, I think that's the real idea of sublimation, you could say. Where it's like,
2941720	2950280	you realize, wait a minute, that suffering and that longing is energy. It's actual, it's actual
2950280	2959160	fuel. And if, and I can redirect that fuel towards other things, and you don't even realize that
2959160	2965640	you, that that exists until you feel it, right? If you're just always kind of somewhat satisfied,
2965640	2971880	you're not going to realize that the, this longing, this longing that you have can be redirected,
2971880	2977880	and it can be redirected towards projects. It can be redirected towards, you know,
2977880	2982920	accomplishing some great task. It can be redirected towards prayer. It can be redirected
2982920	2990360	in all kinds of directions. And then you, then you can see almost what that longing is for,
2990360	2996520	actually. So definitely, of course, I have, I have that. And I hope that I'm
2997160	3003080	doing as much as possible to make it, to make it fruitful, to make that longing fruitful.
3003080	3010840	How often do you misdirect that energy into like self-destruction and burning yourself up?
3010840	3016920	Yeah, probably all the time, in little ways. I mean, like little moments, it's not, it's not
3016920	3023880	like big things, but like little moments where you, you have a frustration or you have a sense that,
3023880	3028120	you know, you're not getting what you should in terms of care. I mean, it's not just sex, but it's
3028120	3033640	like, in terms of love, in terms of attention, in terms of this, like, you can feel that every day,
3033640	3038280	if you're, if you're careful to how you, especially when you're in a family and you,
3038280	3044120	you have all these dynamics. So I would say it happens quite a bit, but, but it's, it's like
3044120	3049240	these little moments where you kind of have to, you have to wake up, you know, and then until
3049240	3054920	you wake up, then you, you end up in these spirals of frustration. But yeah, definitely. I mean,
3055400	3061880	I'm a human being, so it happens quite a bit. The sex one, I think, is especially interesting,
3062760	3072440	because it seems clear that from an evolutionary perspective, it would make sense for humans to
3072440	3078200	yearn to have sex with more than one person. Like, you know, spread the seeds, spread the species,
3078200	3082040	spread the genetics. What else, you know, what else are we going to do? Yeah. You know, and,
3082040	3088280	and, you know, build shelter, you know, weather the storm, spread your genes, hunt, do it over again.
3088280	3095560	Yeah. And then there's like this, you know, this kind of new world that we exist in and nuclear
3095560	3103560	families and the social contracts and, you know, agreements that kind of in a way sits on top,
3103560	3109240	but also we're working on integrating the two to make it be whole, make it like be health,
3109320	3115480	make it be, you know, religio, make it, you know, all of that. But it feels almost like there's two
3115480	3121880	intersecting tracks in that, like your, your, your primal carnal urges to spread the genes.
3121880	3127720	Yep. And then, you know, like from a, from an evolutionary perspective, males would be
3129000	3133320	sexually selected based off of those that like the Genghis Khan's of the world would be more
3133320	3138760	spread. But it's your, your insight is great. It's great, but it's important to understand it,
3139320	3145240	that, that it's important to understand it in terms of these higher goods that we talk about.
3145240	3149800	Right. And so sexuality is probably the easiest way or the best way to understand it,
3149800	3158440	which is that at some point we understand that we have to give up that, some of that,
3158440	3165880	for something which binds us at a higher level. And actually that would be necessary at any,
3165880	3171720	at any scale, like it would be necessary if you just had one male, like in the human species,
3171720	3177480	if you just had one male that was mating with all the women and there, and the other males had no
3177480	3185320	access to women, you would have carnage. If you would just have fighting all the time. And, and,
3185960	3192360	and the truth is that like people idealize hunter-gatherer societies, but you can imagine
3192360	3197560	that people were fighting all the time. And I've been in contact with, with groups that aren't
3197560	3204520	necessarily hunter-gatherers, but have more of that kind of ancient pagan way of being. And that's
3204520	3211560	what happens. People fight over girls non-stop. They fight over women all the time. And people will
3211560	3217400	kill for women, you know. And so this is something which is, and so there's a sense in which you
3217400	3223080	can understand that giving up some of that desire towards higher participation in a society,
3223800	3230280	you can understand that that's fractal, that that's also what you do in you, which is that
3231000	3238760	you realize, oh, if I just focus on pleasure, then I'm not going to be able to
3239720	3245480	accomplish my goals. And so I have to sacrifice some of that. And I have to redirect it towards
3245480	3249880	something higher, which I perceive as higher, as a, as a higher good. It doesn't mean that
3249880	3255640	those desires are bad or that pleasure is bad. None of that is bad. But I do have to concentrate it
3255640	3260120	and re, reorient it. And then I realize, wait a minute, actually what I get from
3261080	3268520	above, when I, what I get from that is really valuable. And the kind of pleasure that I get,
3268600	3275080	let's say, the pleasure of accomplishing something or the pleasure of, of intellectual,
3275640	3280920	intellectual understanding, it's a, it's subtle. It's more subtle than an orgasm.
3281640	3288520	But it calls you like it, it calls you and it has a, it has a force that I think that,
3288520	3293800	especially as you get older, like if when you're like 17, it's hard to argue with that with someone
3293800	3299320	who's like just exploding with, with testosterone. But like, as you kind of get into your thirties
3299320	3304360	and you, you kind of get older, you start to see how actually giving up towards these higher
3304360	3312440	participations, they offer you a type of pleasure, which is very different, but is,
3313480	3321320	but is maybe even more valuable. Yeah. My buddy I've had on here called Chris Williamson. I feel
3321320	3325320	like you guys have maybe, have you done the modern wisdom podcast Chris Williamson? I don't think so.
3325320	3330760	Anyways, he's sweet. A term that I got from him is, is post nut clarity.
3335480	3341160	And everything you're saying is true. Yeah. Post ejaculation. Yeah. Yeah. To be able to like
3341160	3346600	sacrifice that like the before, I feel like this kind of comes into, comes back to like,
3346680	3353160	you know, probably a lot of religious philosophies or, or religions or ideologies,
3353160	3359560	but like, like the value of, of sacrifice, you know, and God sacrificing his only son,
3359560	3365080	you know, on the cross to save us all from his sins. And like, yeah, like the, the ethics within
3365080	3370920	that, like they, they, they're, they've been around for a while. And it seems like, so that's
3370920	3376840	kind of at a more macro, you know, like God level. And then individually, I think we can
3376840	3382360	experience that as well. And then I think that's where there is value. But let me give you just
3382360	3386920	an example based on what you just said, which is that think about, like when I say giving yourself
3386920	3391960	to a higher good. So think about you're in a situation and you could sleep with your friend's
3391960	3396760	girlfriend, like she's up for it, but you know the consequence of that, right? You know what
3396760	3404600	that's going to cost you. And so you decide that actually the friendship I have, my friend,
3405560	3412760	is more valuable than the immediate pleasure. And so you sacrifice that moment, that possibility
3413320	3420440	in order to be bound to a relationship, right? So you can imagine that at multiple levels,
3420440	3424600	like that kind of decision. That's the kind of decision that I'm talking about, which is that
3425560	3432680	you're actually, you're sacrificing immediate, I mean, it's just like delayed satisfaction. But
3432680	3437080	I mean, you can think of it even at a higher level, which is not just that you delay it for later,
3437080	3444200	you're giving it up towards something higher, something more that is less bodily pleasure,
3444200	3447960	but it is a more kind of spiritual pleasure, you could say.
3448440	3455800	So we're not going to have enough time to actually go into the Bible and religion
3455800	3461480	in the way that I would like to, because I was raised very Christian doing Bible study,
3461480	3468920	hanging out with my bros, talking about Jesus, sharing scriptures and such, then got into psychedelics
3468920	3476200	and kind of Buddhism and like other versions of isms and that kind of the concept of like hell
3476200	3487080	seems quite unreasonable. So I wonder your perspective on the, how literal could one take
3487080	3494440	the Bible from your perspective? Like, is it meant to be symbolism, metaphor, allegory,
3494440	3500040	is it meant to be 100% literal? How does one define how literal the Bible is?
3500680	3505160	So or the Quran or the literal thing, I hate that word.
3506600	3511480	First of all, the word literal means according to the text, like that's what the word literal
3511480	3520440	means. People think that the word literal means that what is described is a description of events
3521160	3526120	in the way that I think events should be described. And sometimes I'm not even sure what that is.
3526120	3529160	It's like the way that you would describe events to a police officer, maybe,
3529160	3535800	like if it was the scene of a crime, some kind of forensic, like encyclopedic description of
3535800	3541400	an event, like that's what it should be. And so we think that when we say the Bible is literal,
3541400	3548040	then that's what we're describing. And I think that that's just not what's going on there.
3548040	3554920	The Bible is definitely a description of events, but it's not trying to describe those events
3555000	3562360	in a way that would satisfy a modern rationalist in any way. Like it is a description of events
3562360	3569720	which compresses elements together in order to make them meaningful over a very long span of time.
3570520	3577080	And so because of that, they have a certain form and a certain trope, which is necessary,
3577080	3583000	because if you don't do that, if you don't compress elements of a story into something like
3583080	3588680	universal imagery, then it's going to, no one's going to understand it. So think about,
3588680	3595400	so think about like if someone watched, someone from the 15th century watched pulp fiction,
3595400	3599800	like they would have no idea what they're watching. Like what am I watching? What are these things
3599800	3604840	people have in their hands and what are these things that people are drawing, like putting up
3604840	3610040	their nose or like, what are they, what is this? Like this doesn't mean anything because it's so
3610040	3615880	idiosyncratic. In the Bible, what you have is you have stories that have been compressed and
3615880	3623320	condensed and are telling the events in a way that that's just what it is. And so the idea that
3623320	3630360	the first chapter of Genesis is like some is, could be seen as a scientific description is
3630360	3634360	absolute nonsense. Like it's complete nonsense. And so I'm sorry to all the creationists who
3634360	3638600	think that that's what's going on there. It's just not, it's just not. And but the problem is that
3638600	3643640	it doesn't have to be the idea that that's what's valuable. The idea that a scientific
3643640	3648680	description of an event is what is supremely valuable and everything should conform to that
3648680	3654680	standard is pure nonsense. And so the description of let's say the creation in the first chapter of
3654680	3663400	Genesis is in my, I think is the most powerful and accurate description of the manner in which the
3663400	3669320	world exists. But it is not doing it in a way that like I said, it's not a biologist description.
3669320	3674120	It's the description of a hierarchy of meaning, a hierarchy of participation, you know,
3674120	3680760	so the centrality of consciousness, the centrality of recognizing the good in the world, these things
3680760	3686760	have nothing to do with what they have very little to do with the way that that that a kind of
3686760	3691640	forensic description would be. So I think that all the stories in scripture have to be taken very
3691720	3696680	seriously. Now that you're taken seriously out of description of events, but we don't have to
3696680	3701080	figure out what the mechanical causes are behind some of the things that are there.
3701640	3706680	So people are like reading. So like, I don't know, you read in the book of Joshua that the sun
3706680	3710520	stopped, you know, for 24 hours and people are like, well, how is that possible? Trying to
3710520	3714760	figure out like how the earth could move and what this could happen? How could I describe the
3714760	3720600	mechanical causation of that? It's like, dude, stop it. What are you doing? Who cares? There's a
3720600	3726600	reason why things are described that way. The reason have to do with their meaning. And so you
3726600	3731640	don't have to understand what it is that if you had a video camera, you would be filming and you
3731640	3737480	could you could capture on a video camera. But it also doesn't mean that what it's saying is just
3737480	3743400	something someone made up. It's a description of something in a way that emphasizes its meaning.
3743400	3750520	And it's, you know, it's it's so it's a it's a it's a kind of mythological language. But in the
3750520	3757320	Bible, at least it's it they they they're describing some kind of event, maybe from a distance, maybe
3757320	3764600	from, you know, several generations after maybe from that type of memory, but it but it is a memory
3764600	3769880	of something. Yeah, I analogy, and it's too bad we only have a little bit of time left because
3769880	3773880	I feel like this would be I'm like unpacking something that would be probably several hours of
3773880	3779000	conversation. So, you know, maybe we can come back another time or something. But but an example
3779000	3783240	to my is like last night, I've been writing my dreams down last night, I had a dream where I was
3783240	3790040	like, in this German war zone scenario, and I was like, on my hands and knees and crawling around
3790040	3796360	through puddles and hiding behind car tire things. And I had a gun, and I like lost the gun, and I
3796360	3800520	was trying to find the gun. And then I had to report back. It was all this stuff. And within
3800520	3804440	that, I think if I were to like retrace and be like, Okay, I need to understand this dream. So,
3804440	3808520	I'm going to go to Germany. I'm going to try to find this place. I'm going to try to like,
3808520	3813560	in account of this guy's like, no, no, like, no, it was like, there was a gun. There was truth
3813560	3819320	within the dream. It just wasn't exactly as you know, literal as like your waking consciousness
3819320	3824680	may want to define it as this kind of what I'm maybe perhaps gathering and that might be a little
3824680	3830040	bit of a stretch, but but even like your waking consciousness. Now, so think about how right
3830040	3834920	now, let's say around you, there, there's millions of things happening at the same time. There's like
3834920	3839960	billions and billions of things happening simultaneously around you. And so in order
3839960	3849240	for you to make sense of that, you have to draw phenomena into coherent through a coherent line.
3849240	3853480	So even if it's just your day, like you went through your day, you get home, like there are
3853480	3857560	millions of things that happen to you that day, like millions and millions and millions. And so
3857560	3861800	but then you tell the story of your day, what you're going to do is you're going to compress,
3861800	3865080	you're going to take the elements that are meaningful, and you're going to compress them
3865080	3871080	together in a manner in which you are going to show the line that connects these elements together.
3871080	3879320	Okay, so that's how we do it. Now, think of that now over a thousand years instead of over one day.
3880280	3887560	Think of how I can do that in a manner in which I would have to tell the story of my day to someone
3887560	3893400	in a thousand years. And so there's a kind of compression that happens. And that compression
3894680	3898840	doesn't mean that it's like I said, it doesn't mean that you didn't have a day or that
3899480	3903800	but it means that there are so many examples that I could give you. But like, let's say
3904520	3908920	a simple example would be, let's say in that story of the German story,
3908920	3913560	your dream, you're trying to tell that to someone. You're trying to tell that to someone who lives,
3913560	3920920	who's a Maasai in Kenya, right, from 500 years ago. And so are you going to say you had a gun?
3922520	3925960	No, you're going to say I had a weapon, right? You're going to say something like I had a
3925960	3931640	weapon in my hands. But that Maasai, they only understand a weapon to be something like a lance.
3932200	3936840	But they might have the same dream or a totally different dream with the same like undercurrent
3936840	3942760	of truth. They'll have a lance in their hand instead of a gun. Yeah. And so that's the type
3942760	3950760	of contraction that I'm saying. It's like if I say a sword, that has way more power than if I say
3950760	3957320	a Glock. Because a Glock is like a super reduced version. And even if I say a gun is better than
3957320	3962440	if I name like the brand of the thing. It's like this, it's this compression of elements
3962440	3970040	that is what ancient storytelling was doing and what you find in scripture. So some of them reach
3970040	3977880	levels that are so high, like a serpent, you know, like a tree, like a, like a garden. These
3977880	3985640	elements are now universal and so compressed. I'm going to ask about something just to generally
3985880	3993160	put it into the ether to reflect upon. I'm curious to your perception of things like the ancient
3993160	3997960	fertility cults, like the sacred mushroom and the cross book, the John Allegro book and
3999000	4004600	Ellucinian mysteries and, you know, all of like the mystery cults of Greece, etc. And the potential
4004600	4012280	of, you know, ergot or LSD being used to as like these like death, death and rebirth ceremonies.
4012280	4017640	And a lot of what we gather from the Bible in fact has influenced from the psychedelic experience
4017640	4024040	and conflation of these different like ancient practices into what we now call, you know,
4024600	4035240	Bible and God and death and rebirth and. Well, let me say this. I think that it is 60 seconds.
4035240	4041640	What do you think about that? No, but I what I do think is that it is exactly a
4042600	4049240	it is exactly an image of the reductionism at which we've arrived in terms of modern
4049240	4055720	scientism, which is that we want to find the substance. What's the chemical? Like what's the
4055720	4061880	chemical? What's the what's the binding thing? You know, what's the what's the what's the medicine?
4061880	4069080	And that's what we think is happening. So the whole psychedelic Ellucinian mysteries things
4069080	4074680	is hilarious. I find it just hilarious, which is that the Ellucinian ministries lasted what three
4074680	4083080	days, four days of nonstop like rituals, all like that would take you through an entire process
4083800	4088200	that was extremely complex and that no one knows about because everybody has kept it a secret.
4089320	4094760	And then you get to the end of it. And then you have a final revelation. Now, whether or not that
4094840	4103480	revelation might have been supplemented by some chemical is possible. But the idea that that's
4103480	4109240	what it is is absolutely ridiculous. It's completely ridiculous. And even people who talk
4109240	4115560	about the psychedelics, it's like, how about if we talk about, let's at least talk about the vision
4115560	4119800	instead of talking about the stupid mushroom, like it's like they just people get obsessed with the
4119800	4124760	stupid mushroom, like let's at least talk about the vision and see the coherence of the vision
4124760	4130040	across the different traditions. Let's at least talk about that. But the idea that so for example,
4130040	4137880	like the only thing that's closest to the so called mystery cults right now in the world is
4137880	4145000	the Christian liturgy. That's the closest thing that you can have, because it is it is a a death
4145000	4149880	and rebirth ritual through baptism. It is a movement into a scandalous mystery, which is
4149880	4154680	the Eucharist, a revelation at the end of participation and eating the body of a God.
4154680	4161000	Like that is that's what Christianity is. But the idea that if we could just have psychedelics,
4161800	4167320	well, no, no, no, no, that's, that's more just, that's more just like an interesting kind of thing
4167320	4171720	to hang to like a handle to grab one toes, like, oh, interesting. I think that there's like,
4171800	4177240	or deal poisoning, you know, like the form of like fasting, and, you know, there's, there's
4177240	4181480	like the sun dance, Native American sun dance thing, or you're fasting for several days, and
4181480	4185000	you're dancing around a tree, and then you're hung from the tree, and you're going through this like
4185000	4189080	death and rebirth, like losing of the body, you're finally coming to a point where
4189080	4194600	your body is so drained, you think you're on the edge of of transitioning out of the body,
4194600	4200600	and suddenly there's this like, oh, okay, I'm rebirthed again, you know, I'm born again,
4200600	4204680	like that, I think that happens many in many different scenarios, like a right of passage
4204680	4208840	in culture is very common, but it's something that, you know, I don't know that there's a definitive
4208840	4214280	right of passage in Western culture, for the most part, but it doesn't need to be psychedelics per
4214280	4220600	say, just something. Well, we have something called baptism, which is, which is, which is that, and
4220600	4226360	it is, it is definitely a death and rebirth. There's also the, so the idea of reaching these
4226440	4232840	states through fasting is probably much better, because the problem with the psychedelics, and I
4232840	4240520	can see it, it's that at least my, my encounter with people that have just done psychedelics is that
4241640	4246440	I don't think they come back with, not sure they come back with much, like I'm not that impressed
4246440	4252440	with, with the things that I've heard people come back with. Some of it seems really confused,
4252520	4258600	like some of it seems, because it's like you rip the veil off, and then you enter into a world of,
4259640	4265800	of encounters with, let's say, transpersonal beings, but it's like they're all kinds of
4265800	4270920	transpersonal beings, like it's not as if everything that exists in the, in the invisible
4271800	4278360	is there to help you and is good, like that's not true. And so I, I feel like there's a lot of,
4278360	4282520	and so I'm not, I'm not totally discounting it, like I'm not saying that it's evil or whatever,
4282520	4288120	I'm just, I just am not super impressed, and like I, I'm not impressed at what psychedelics did
4288680	4295400	to, in the 60s, to our culture, and I am very wary about them coming back right now, because
4296040	4301880	we, we're in a worse place than we were in the 60s, like we are, we are in a more disjointed,
4301880	4310360	broken, narcissistic space than people were in the 60s. So imagining that coming back, I don't know,
4310360	4316280	man. I mean, it'd be tough. I mean, now it's becoming like more of like a passionate conversation,
4316280	4321160	and now we're going to, we're going to close it, but I mean, it's tough to say that anything as
4321160	4325240	an absolute, like you could, like there's suggestions that Francis Crick, part of his
4325240	4331240	discovery of the triple helix model was a product of him using, I think it was LSD,
4331240	4336440	and taking this huge, you know, massive information that he's been aggregating,
4336440	4340360	and then through that psychedelic experience or, you know, whatever you work on, psychedelics,
4340360	4342920	another one of those words, kind of like Spirit of God, whatever, it's got a lot of,
4342920	4347320	a lot of flakes on it. Those seemingly like disparate connections that he was, he was in
4347320	4351400	these different tunnels, suddenly like fused for a moment, and then he comes out of that
4351400	4355640	experience because he's done so much work in his like, his other world.
4356120	4359880	Yeah, so you could understand it, you could understand that that's probably
4359880	4365800	what something that the Ellucian Mysteries were offering. They would create a massive ritual that
4365800	4371640	lasted several days, and then in the last moment, there would be some, they would use some supplement,
4371640	4377480	and that that would, so you can imagine like, there's a little residue, a little residue of that
4378120	4383000	in Christian communion, especially in the monastic sphere where someone would be fasting for,
4383080	4388520	would be fasting probably for a whole day, or at least maybe more before they would take communion,
4388520	4393640	and then there would be a little bit of that with, in terms of, obviously it's not psychedelic,
4393640	4401480	but a little bit of, let's say, a little help to kind of break down some things with taking
4401480	4408600	wine after having fasted for a few days. Yeah, and I think the confusion as well could
4408920	4414200	make sense, the sensation of like, oh, like what you're saying doesn't feel so cogent,
4414760	4420760	and perhaps within some of those, I don't know, like super conscious states, for lack of better
4420760	4427240	words, maybe a person kind of stumbles in territory that's not as effable as like what they would
4427240	4430680	read or, you know, or regurgitate out of a book, and it's kind of like- Yeah, well, they don't,
4430680	4436120	people rarely talk about the bad trip. People don't talk about the bad trip for some reason,
4436120	4441080	because I mean, I have witnessed people, like I have witnessed people in my
4442440	4446760	surrounding kind of just go down that route, and I mean, I don't know if it's because they were
4446760	4451400	already psychologically fragile, but like I've watched them break apart, like I've watched them
4452360	4461240	go into a psychotic state as soon as really hard things started to present themselves to them.
4461240	4469320	So yeah, so I think that I do worry about this cold resurgence of psychedelics right now. I
4469320	4474920	definitely, I worry about it because I'm afraid people are going to see it as an easy way in.
4475640	4479880	It's like, well, just take this pill, you know, you want to know what spirituality is? Just take
4479880	4489640	this pill. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a lot to say there. At least for some people, it seems to be
4489640	4496760	that like- Certainly, you can, I think a person can develop a dependence on, you know, a clergy
4496760	4501880	person can develop a dependence on the idea of God, you know, and then wearing that as a mask,
4501880	4506120	and putting on the robe and putting on the cross, and there's that, that exists, a spiritual person
4506120	4510440	can do that with the beads, you know, like there's a lot of different versions of that, and someone
4510440	4514440	could wear an ayahuasca route around their neck, and like that's their thing, and they go back and
4514440	4520040	they do their own psychedelic baptism every six months, but they don't actually resource themselves
4520040	4530280	in their waking life to be able to fulfill some of the lessons that they garnered during that
4530280	4534440	experience. So they just go back to their previous momentum, and that's when it becomes kind of
4534440	4539720	bullshitty, where it's like, no, no, like the window gets opened in various different ways.
4539720	4543960	You can have a near-death experience, you could fall in love, you could eat way too many mushrooms,
4543960	4549480	you know, or whatever, you know, wow, like the window is out, the veil has been thinned,
4549480	4553960	and now the window closes, now what do you do with it? And I think that's the difference between
4554520	4558920	someone that's like a Michael Pollan, for example, where people seem to like respect his perspective,
4558920	4563160	and like the rainbow gathering person that still doesn't have a job, and you know, still
4563160	4567720	isn't really like that effective in society, which effective, I don't really like, you know,
4567720	4573160	it's a dumb thing to say, but you know what I mean? So that's, there's nuance to everything,
4573160	4578040	including religion, including the psychedelic experience, including, you know, everything.
4578040	4583080	Yeah, well, I've never done psychedelics, so I'm definitely not, I don't, I want to be careful
4583080	4591960	that I'm not, that I'm not being too harsh, but I do see, like, I don't know, I do see that it's,
4591960	4596600	the fact that it's so public, and everybody's talking about it so publicly, I think it worries
4596600	4602200	me, you know. For good reason. Even at the time of the, if there was part of something like the
4602200	4607400	Elusinian mysteries, and if it was part of some of the rituals that existed in the past, and it
4607400	4612440	would always have been like secret, it would always have been something that was kept, because
4612440	4618760	it's also very dangerous. So, and it doesn't get conflated into like an egoic badge of honor,
4618760	4624920	which then it's kind of tripping back into that previous momentum of, you know, egotism or whatever.
4624920	4630120	Now, suddenly, you're like, the ego is so strong, that you had so much momentum in that, now you're
4630120	4635640	taking this divine quotations, or maybe not in quotations experience, and you're actually
4635640	4641160	leveraging the divine to bolster the ego. And that's like, oh, like, all right, what do we do with
4641160	4646520	that? You know, and then, you know, that's a whole other conversation. Thanks, man. I hope.
4646520	4650200	I'm gonna, yeah, I need to go now, but it was good to, it was good to meet you, took me in
4650200	4656600	surprising places. Good times. Is there a place that people ought to be directed to go from here,
4656600	4660840	if they want to go deeper into your stuff, your podcast and YouTube? And people can check out the
4660840	4666040	symbolicworld.com. That's my website. And that's where you'll find most of the, like, I have a
4666040	4670040	presence on YouTube, and there's a podcast version of what I'm doing. And there's a group, like a
4670040	4675240	kind of community of people around that are writing articles about this kind of symbolic thinking,
4675240	4678120	a symbolic vision of the world. So yeah, people can check that out.
4678120	4682600	Right. Thank you, man. At some point, we'd love to run it back and maybe start with the
4683320	4685480	start with the Bible stuff. Start with the Bible stuff.
4688680	4698520	All right. That is it. That is all. Thank you all for tuning in. And I'll see you all soon.
