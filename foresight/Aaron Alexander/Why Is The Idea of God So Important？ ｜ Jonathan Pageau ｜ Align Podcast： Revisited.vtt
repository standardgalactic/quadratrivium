00:00.000 --> 00:13.160
I want to start with a quote to get things moving from from Mr. Voltaire, and I'm curious

00:13.160 --> 00:16.160
your perception of it. I feel like you'll probably have some thoughts.

00:16.160 --> 00:21.480
A quote that I find interesting is, if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent

00:21.480 --> 00:26.240
him. So I think it's interesting that Voltaire chooses him. I think that's worth discussing

00:26.240 --> 00:33.680
as well, and also the necessity to invent said God. If it, she, him did not exist in

00:33.680 --> 00:38.000
some absolute manner. What do you think about all that?

00:38.000 --> 00:43.800
I mean, I understand the impetus behind the quote in the sense that one of the things

00:43.800 --> 00:48.400
I think we're seeing more easily right now is we had a moment where we, some people,

00:48.400 --> 00:52.600
at least some people thought that we could just be rational and scientific and we could

00:52.600 --> 00:58.120
just get rid of all these superstitions, then we would, we'd be good, we'd be fine.

00:58.120 --> 01:04.120
And what we're noticing is that that's not what's happening. People are becoming nihilistic,

01:04.120 --> 01:08.040
you know, they're moving into despair. We're noticing we don't have much to hold us together

01:08.040 --> 01:13.640
in terms of societies. We don't have things that bind us anymore as we get rid of, as

01:13.640 --> 01:18.200
we get rid of religion, as we get rid of God. And so I think that that's probably what Voltaire

01:18.200 --> 01:23.080
was perceiving was the notion that we need something above us, something transcendent

01:23.080 --> 01:29.360
to unify us, or else we tend to fragment and to scatter. So I think that the intuition

01:29.360 --> 01:36.240
behind, behind Voltaire is right. And you see a lot of people that say today, taking

01:36.240 --> 01:40.560
that very cynically in the sense that they realize we need something to bind us together

01:40.560 --> 01:45.560
so it could be anything, we could just put something up there. And we just need, we need

01:45.560 --> 01:49.160
it, or else we need to celebrate something together, or else why are we something, why

01:49.160 --> 01:53.400
are we a country, why are we a nation, why are we a family, why are we a group rather

01:53.400 --> 01:56.400
than just a bunch of individuals slamming against each other.

01:56.400 --> 02:02.040
I reflect on that quite regularly, internally at a deeper level, I have a sensation of like,

02:02.040 --> 02:09.080
I can have a sensation of like, aimlessness. And a part of that I have these various, like

02:09.080 --> 02:14.400
what I would concede to be like illusions of perceived progress. And that's something

02:14.400 --> 02:18.360
that I, I ask a lot of, I feel like most people can kind of collectively agree of like, yeah,

02:18.360 --> 02:23.880
like progress, like, well, let's, let's do progress. And then that presents the question

02:23.880 --> 02:27.960
of like, okay, perfect, I love, love that love the morale, but like progress towards

02:27.960 --> 02:32.680
what? Like what is our ultimate end goal here? What are we progressing toward?

02:32.680 --> 02:37.960
No, I totally agree that that's definitely a problem, especially in terms of modern kind

02:37.960 --> 02:43.960
of atheist progressive narrative, which is that, what are we aiming at? Because in order

02:44.000 --> 02:47.880
to progress, you need an aim, you need to be moving in a direction or else you're just

02:47.880 --> 02:53.440
aimlessly wandering. And so the question is, what is it that's happening? It's easier.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.800
I think one of the mistakes that we've seen in the, in with the enlightenment and, and

02:57.800 --> 03:03.680
it's, and what came after is we had this idea that if we progress in terms of technical

03:03.680 --> 03:09.320
knowledge, that is, if we accumulate technical knowledge, then that's similar to the manner

03:09.360 --> 03:13.680
in which we're going to progress morally as a nation, as nations, as people, but those

03:13.680 --> 03:18.440
are not, they're not the same. The accumulation of technical knowledge is not the same as

03:18.440 --> 03:23.960
morality or, or understanding what it is that makes a life worth living. These are not the

03:23.960 --> 03:29.560
same thing. And I don't think that we have progressed in that at all. I think on the

03:29.560 --> 03:36.560
contrary, I think that we have traded one for the other. We've traded a kind of comfort,

03:36.800 --> 03:43.320
technical comfort and material comfort. We've traded that for purpose and we've traded that

03:43.320 --> 03:49.720
for virtue and for a sense that we are moving towards something valuable. And because of

03:49.720 --> 03:55.000
it, people are, people are lost. Well, not everybody, but there's definitely a sense

03:55.000 --> 03:59.720
around us. When I look at young people, especially, you know, the despair is palpable.

04:00.240 --> 04:06.360
Yeah. Yeah. And so you, so you asked before, we press record, like, why, like, why the heck

04:06.360 --> 04:13.680
do you have me here? I'm like a theologian icon, iconographer, philosopher, like, what does

04:13.680 --> 04:17.160
this have to do with like, this is supposed to be like a health thing or something? One,

04:17.160 --> 04:23.440
there's like, I had John Revekey on recently, and I know that you guys are close. And one

04:23.440 --> 04:27.600
of the things that came up with that was like the, the meaning crisis, like we're going

04:27.640 --> 04:33.480
to be like a, like a meaning crisis of, is there some kind of ground to stand on? Are

04:33.480 --> 04:39.680
we just on this kind of slippery, illusory, hollow sensation of progress towards some

04:39.680 --> 04:46.040
technological financial gain, like towards what? And I think it's interesting that within

04:46.040 --> 04:52.040
like disease or dis-ease, you know, probably a hundred percent of diseases or there's

04:52.040 --> 04:58.160
some root of stress involved in that somewhere in the system. And we can address that

04:58.160 --> 05:03.120
topically or allopathically and say, aha, here, here is the tumor, but then you can wind it

05:03.120 --> 05:08.360
back. And, you know, at some point, there's, there's something to cause friction in the

05:08.360 --> 05:14.680
system to eventually manifest as some type of, you know, physical expression of disease. And

05:14.680 --> 05:18.680
so when the majority of people that are visiting a hospital are there for something that's

05:18.720 --> 05:23.800
stress related or something that's like psychosomatic, mental, emotional, you know,

05:23.800 --> 05:28.520
lifestyle related or something that would just pass on its own, but we're seeking out for this

05:28.520 --> 05:34.680
pill or solution, at the root there, I feel like we can start to address some of our medical

05:35.080 --> 05:41.840
experiences through like these, this internal lens, you know, and through starting to establish,

05:42.360 --> 05:46.040
you know, maybe starting to address that, like that, that, that meaning crisis that, that I

05:46.040 --> 05:50.920
personally experience, you know, I feel like many other people resonate with that. So what do you,

05:50.920 --> 05:56.920
what do you think about that? Like that, that, that internal experience, eventually expressing

05:56.920 --> 06:05.240
out into, you know, a physical manifestation and some path maybe towards like finding relationship

06:05.240 --> 06:11.000
or balance or homeostasis between the two, the internal and the external, I guess, is maybe

06:11.000 --> 06:15.160
like why I was, I wanted to have this conversation with you. Yeah. I think you're right. I think

06:15.160 --> 06:20.760
that you definitely, the idea that there is a relationship between, let's say our own inner

06:20.760 --> 06:27.480
direction and our exterior manifestations in the body is definitely something which happens.

06:27.480 --> 06:34.600
I think the mistake that we make, especially us today, is that we, we look for, we think that

06:34.600 --> 06:39.240
we're going to find that in some kind of like comfort, like we think we're going to find that in

06:39.240 --> 06:45.720
some kind of, you know, if I could just be relaxed enough, if I could just rest enough, if I could

06:45.720 --> 06:52.200
just, you know, let's say, serve myself enough, like if I could take care of my needs, you know,

06:52.200 --> 06:57.800
I need to, I need some me time, like that's the, that's the, the, the modern way of looking at it,

06:57.800 --> 07:04.680
that actually accentuates the problem. And it, I think that the, the more ancient solution would

07:04.760 --> 07:09.960
have been something like give yourself. If you give yourself, then a lot of those other things,

07:10.680 --> 07:16.600
they tend to diminish. Not that you won't be sick, maybe you will, but it won't matter so much,

07:16.600 --> 07:21.640
because you'll be living, you'll be living a purposeful life and you'll be living towards,

07:21.640 --> 07:26.200
towards, because what do you do, what do you want? You just want to live until you're 99 years old and

07:26.200 --> 07:31.080
be miserable, you know, and internally and be physically, you could be physically fit and

07:31.160 --> 07:36.760
kind of looking to be relaxed and to, to live as long as possible. Or it seems like the,

07:36.760 --> 07:41.480
the more ancient vision is something like give yourself. If you give yourself, then you actually

07:41.480 --> 07:45.880
might have a very short life. You might have a very short and painful life, but that short and

07:45.880 --> 07:51.800
painful life will be bright. It'll be shining. And look at the people that we admire. Like we,

07:51.800 --> 07:57.160
we, we don't admire, we admire people that have done that, right? Those are the people that shine

07:57.240 --> 08:03.240
to us. Like, like stars, people who, who give themselves for a cause, who give themselves to

08:03.240 --> 08:07.560
others, you know, they become something else. And so the image that we have, for example,

08:07.560 --> 08:13.320
Christianity is actually the opposite of it's, it really is the image of someone who's willing

08:13.320 --> 08:19.160
to die for his friends, who's willing to die for others. That is actually what brings the real

08:19.160 --> 08:24.760
balance. But I, but I do feel like right now we have a kind of weird twisted version of that,

08:24.760 --> 08:30.280
which is trying to heal my own, all my own issues, like heal my stuff. And then,

08:30.280 --> 08:34.360
then I'll find homeostasis. But yeah, there's a book I've mentioned here a bunch of times called

08:34.360 --> 08:40.120
whatever you think, think the opposite by Paul Arden. I think that's comes up in what you're

08:40.120 --> 08:48.760
saying now. I think it is like, you would, I would think that by focusing on the individual,

08:48.760 --> 08:55.400
the individual will start to get, you know, become more and more robust and, and like well

08:55.400 --> 09:02.200
developed and complex and content, you know, and all of those things. But in fact, it takes

09:03.000 --> 09:10.040
like relinquishing the attachment to the self in order to come back around and heal the self

09:10.040 --> 09:15.160
and like grow the self. So it's like in the forgetting of the self, the self is actually

09:16.040 --> 09:20.840
has the spaciousness to, to grow and heal and do all the things. Whereas when there's excessive

09:20.840 --> 09:26.120
focus on the self and losing that connection outward, then it's like, I feel like the self

09:26.120 --> 09:32.200
like suffocates on itself. Yeah, but there is like, there is a possibility of practicing,

09:33.160 --> 09:38.280
of practicing doing certain practices, you know, on yourself, with yourself, like meditation prayer,

09:38.920 --> 09:43.240
some kind of a schesis, you know, when you, and I think people who also do physical activity

09:43.240 --> 09:47.880
have a different version of that, which is that you feel your limit, you know, you feel your limit

09:47.880 --> 09:52.680
constantly, and you're trying to push further than your limit. Those are, those are practices that

09:52.680 --> 09:59.160
can actually help you understand how it works. Like it's not about, it's not, it's not comfort

09:59.160 --> 10:04.200
doesn't give meaning at all. Like, you know, feeling good about yourself is not, is not the

10:04.200 --> 10:11.000
way to go. People are going to hate hearing that. But actually trying to, anything that makes you

10:11.000 --> 10:16.520
transcend yourself is going to start with pain. It's going to start with a sense of disease,

10:16.520 --> 10:23.080
exactly a disease in general. Like I am, I'm not where I should be. I need, I need, I need to, to,

10:23.080 --> 10:27.320
to kind of move in the right direction. Of course, we can beat ourselves up too. And that's not

10:27.320 --> 10:31.240
helpful. Usually beating ourselves up for not being where we want to be is another kind of

10:31.240 --> 10:36.920
weird self centered thing. Like it's a weird kind of a kind of moving it back, moving into

10:36.920 --> 10:41.720
experience and just feeling sorry for yourself or feeling guilty all the time. That's probably not,

10:41.720 --> 10:45.800
that's not the right way to go about it either. But you do need to feel some pain in order to

10:45.800 --> 10:50.760
move towards meaning. Yeah, they're so back to Viveki, something that I learned from him as the,

10:50.760 --> 10:57.640
the origin of the word religion is religio or something of the sort. And it means to bind

10:57.640 --> 11:04.280
or to bring together, like to unite, which is also the origin of the word yoga, yoke union

11:04.280 --> 11:10.680
connection. I mean, it's like it like spans across so many different ideologies, this idea of like

11:10.680 --> 11:19.720
connection. Yeah. And so I feel like the word religion, the word God, the word spirit, spirituality,

11:19.720 --> 11:27.400
all of those have so many meanings and kind of like these crusty old barnacles attached to them.

11:27.400 --> 11:31.800
Yeah. And so that like at the, at the, at the root of most of those words is like, oh, it's pretty

11:31.800 --> 11:42.040
good. It's valuable. But then the outside, there's just a lot of flaky. Yeah, a lot of flakes attached

11:42.040 --> 11:46.520
to it. I totally agree. And now, and now it's, now there's a confusion for the flake for the actual,

11:46.520 --> 11:52.360
like the root. No, you're right. And it's, and it's actually the fault, a lot of it is the fault

11:52.360 --> 11:57.560
of the religious people, where they started, I think there was a lot of forgetting, like just a

11:57.560 --> 12:02.360
forgetting of what all this stuff is about. And it becoming more and more arbitrary in the modern

12:02.360 --> 12:07.800
world. As people became materialists, it's as if a lot of this stuff became arbitrary. So it was

12:07.800 --> 12:16.040
like, you're a Christian, so you believe that some guy died on a cross, and now you're going to go to

12:16.040 --> 12:21.160
heaven. If you believe that, that's, that's what, that's what a Christian is, really? Like, that's

12:21.160 --> 12:27.720
it? That's pathetic. That's really lame, if that's what it is. But it was really, it's really cute.

12:27.720 --> 12:32.840
It's like childish, right? It's like, like really beautiful, actually. It's like, wow, like you are

12:32.840 --> 12:39.000
a 50 year old woman or man. And this is like a Disney, which, you know, I think there's a lot of

12:39.000 --> 12:44.360
meaning in, in fictional novels and tales and all that stuff. And they're, they're relating back to

12:44.360 --> 12:50.600
that core root truth, typically. But it's, I mean, I think it's not, not having like a pessimistic

12:50.600 --> 12:55.560
feeling of like, oh my God, I can't believe it. It's also kind of like, wow, that's amazing. Like,

12:55.560 --> 13:02.280
I find that beautiful. Well, I mean, I think that for a lot of people, having that maybe that simple

13:02.280 --> 13:08.840
faith could probably be totally fine. But it also, there also needs to be, there needs to be an

13:08.840 --> 13:14.120
intellectual version of that. And it has always existed. It was always there. If you read the

13:14.120 --> 13:17.720
early church fathers, you read the mystics, like it's all there. It's just that a lot of it has

13:17.720 --> 13:22.280
been forgotten. And it's interesting, because right now there's an interesting moment, like people

13:22.280 --> 13:28.440
like John Revecki are part of that, where because of the space, because of the space where cognitive

13:28.440 --> 13:34.600
science is now introducing itself into the discourse, and we realize that we can't escape

13:34.600 --> 13:40.520
perception, like we can't escape this experience of the world, and that we can't pretend like it's

13:40.520 --> 13:45.160
not there and just talk about science as if it's outside of that. So coming back to this experience

13:45.160 --> 13:51.240
and this experience of quality of this experience of, you know, of patterns and of embodiment,

13:52.040 --> 13:56.600
then we can start to realize what religion is. Again, we can start to understand it, that we can

13:56.600 --> 14:02.600
we can see that the world presents itself as so multifaceted, that unless we have things which

14:02.600 --> 14:09.560
bind phenomena together, then everything scatters, especially at the human level. If we don't have

14:09.640 --> 14:16.440
ritualization, we don't have story, we don't have orders, which bind even yourself, like your

14:16.440 --> 14:23.480
own personal self, and your family, and then you scale that up, you know, cosmically, then the

14:23.480 --> 14:29.320
world doesn't exist. And then you realize, oh, well, that's what religion is. It's the it's the

14:29.320 --> 14:34.040
man in which things bind together that ends up looking like ritual, it ends up looking like

14:34.040 --> 14:37.880
story, it ends up looking like all the things what people think are silly and superstitious.

14:38.440 --> 14:43.480
But actually without them, reality scatters, and you can you can apply to your life, you realize

14:43.480 --> 14:47.800
actually that most of the things you do are ritualized, and there's nothing superstitious

14:47.800 --> 14:52.600
about them, like brushing your teeth is a ritualized act towards a purpose. But you have

14:52.600 --> 14:59.160
ritualized acts towards purposes that are higher than just getting your teeth clean, that are about

14:59.160 --> 15:04.440
how can we bind together as a group, how can we recognize what it is that we have in common?

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
And then it looks like processions, it looks like circumambulation, it looks like

15:09.000 --> 15:15.080
singing together, it looks like all these things which which the modern person found silly,

15:15.720 --> 15:22.120
they kind of flow back in. I feel like there can be like, I mean, like you're saying like you can't

15:22.120 --> 15:26.920
escape religion, you can't escape dogma, we didn't say you can't, you can't even say exactly, but

15:26.920 --> 15:34.040
I imagine you probably align with that to some degree, or maybe not. But so today, you can see

15:34.120 --> 15:39.960
Christianity seems at least in my bubble of a world that I exist in, seems to be waning

15:39.960 --> 15:45.240
popularity of it. You know, there's a lot more like spirituality in quotations. There's like,

15:45.240 --> 15:49.320
we're certainly worshiping, you know, we worship our cell phones, we worship our

15:50.520 --> 15:57.160
notifications, we worship our financial status, we worship our socio economic status where we're

15:57.160 --> 16:02.440
at on the ladder, you know, so we're like, we're worshiping a lot, a lot, maybe more than ever,

16:02.520 --> 16:10.760
really. As far as like compulsive worship, we might be at the highest, you know, not that it's a

16:10.760 --> 16:16.680
competition, but we may be at like the highest state of worship ever, at least from the lens of

16:16.680 --> 16:21.720
like compulsive worship. Yeah, but there's also, there's also prescribed, there's also like prescribed

16:21.720 --> 16:27.000
worship, which is actually pretty strong right now, people don't really realize it, but you know,

16:27.880 --> 16:34.200
it's just because people have separated the notion of religion from other ritualized aspects of

16:34.200 --> 16:39.400
their life. But if, for example, you realize, you could say that recycling is a form of worship,

16:39.400 --> 16:46.680
you know, because you are ritually acting in a way which is prescribed to you from above,

16:47.320 --> 16:53.000
in order to participate in a story and a purpose together. And so we all, you know,

16:53.000 --> 16:58.280
on one day, this day a week, we all put out our separated materials or whatever. And so

16:58.280 --> 17:03.400
there is a ritualized procession about that, which is similar to a religious procession,

17:03.400 --> 17:07.320
it's just that it's ordered towards something else. And you can say what's different because

17:07.320 --> 17:11.800
that's really valuable, like saving the environment is really valuable. And I would say, yeah,

17:11.800 --> 17:18.280
you're right, saving the environment is really valuable. But us binding together, let's say,

17:18.360 --> 17:25.160
under the transcendent source of love is probably pretty valuable too, right? It probably has a

17:25.160 --> 17:33.000
value that is powerful as well. So I think we can re-understand a lot of the practices of our

17:33.000 --> 17:39.880
ancestors, even if we're able to notice, like you said, that we worship. And the problem is exactly

17:39.880 --> 17:44.680
what you said is that addiction is a form of worship, especially addiction. It's one of the

17:44.680 --> 17:48.520
most easy. If you want to understand worship, like addiction is one of the best ways because

17:48.520 --> 17:55.400
it's a ritualized cycle of attention, you know, and you get possessed by it. And it actually ends up,

17:56.120 --> 18:02.360
let's say, reorganizing your life around its attention, right, around its existence. And so

18:02.360 --> 18:09.960
it actually uses you as a body in order to make sure that you are sacrificing and propitiating to

18:10.600 --> 18:16.440
this God. But you can see how it's like a demon, right? It's like a parasitic God, you could say.

18:16.440 --> 18:22.760
It's a God that actually ultimately wants to destroy you. But it can help you understand

18:22.760 --> 18:27.560
what worship is, which is that when we would do that, like if a person would go through the beads

18:27.560 --> 18:35.080
of their prayer rope or whatever, that's similar in terms of this binded attention,

18:35.080 --> 18:41.400
which is ritualized in order to get you somewhere. Yeah, there's a quote from Alan Watts. I mean,

18:41.400 --> 18:47.000
I think it's from Alan Watts. I've heard it from Alan Watts. They said that we're confusing the

18:47.000 --> 18:55.960
menus for the meal. And so we're eating, you know, the words duck confit, you know, like chewing on

18:55.960 --> 19:02.600
the paper duck confit. But there's no like fat, you know, an omega threes and like there's just

19:02.600 --> 19:08.760
not there's no calories there. Yeah. And so that's the reason that that that quote's coming to mind

19:08.760 --> 19:13.720
is like, I wonder if there is some hierarchy of worship. I think often as we can romanticize

19:13.720 --> 19:18.600
the ancients, you know, and romanticize hunter gatherers and like everything we're doing now is

19:18.600 --> 19:26.600
wrong. Yeah, everything that happened yesterday was the way. It's like, what is like, is there like

19:26.600 --> 19:31.640
some ultimate absolute better, you know, or is there like, how do we parse apart like where is

19:31.640 --> 19:36.120
the menu? Where is the meal? Does it matter in the first place? Are we all just going to end up in

19:36.120 --> 19:41.320
the same place anyway? Yeah, well, I think there is. I think there's an objective, I think there's

19:41.320 --> 19:46.760
an objective hierarchy of worship for sure. And you can actually see it kind of playing itself out

19:46.760 --> 19:52.920
in the story of religion or the man in which religion developed through the centuries. And it

19:52.920 --> 19:58.040
does have to do with understanding where the good lies, you could say, what is it, the good that

19:58.040 --> 20:06.360
binds us? What is it? You know, and I would say that it moves towards something like love, towards

20:06.360 --> 20:11.960
something like compassion, self giving or self sacrifice. And I think that you can find that,

20:11.960 --> 20:15.640
you know, of course in Christianity, but I think you see some of that in Buddhism, although it's

20:15.640 --> 20:22.120
not personalized so much in Buddhism. But you do find this idea that the highest, let's say the

20:22.120 --> 20:27.960
highest value, the thing that should bind us together is actually paradoxically a giving away,

20:27.960 --> 20:35.080
like it's a self emptying. And this self emptying becomes the thing which makes it possible for

20:35.080 --> 20:43.000
us to exist as more than just these selfish little beings. And so I think that that is a

20:43.000 --> 20:47.800
true hierarchy of being. And so you can imagine local gods, for example, in the time of hunter

20:47.800 --> 20:52.680
gatherers that had some function and some power over the group and would bind them together,

20:52.680 --> 20:57.800
would give them a totem, would give them some type of identity and characteristics that they could,

20:57.800 --> 21:04.200
that they could celebrate and participate in. But ultimately, that leads to constant war,

21:04.200 --> 21:09.560
like it just leads to nonstop war. Because you're, you're, these gods are fighting in the heavens,

21:09.560 --> 21:13.560
right? These different gods, these different totems and gods are fighting amongst each other.

21:13.560 --> 21:17.960
As the tribes fight and are constantly at war, we always forget that the Greeks,

21:17.960 --> 21:24.200
even though they saw themselves as being one people, they were always fighting nonstop. Every

21:24.200 --> 21:29.720
year, people would go to war. So the idea of binding towards higher goods, I think is something

21:29.720 --> 21:36.920
which happened for a reason. As far as like making this conversation actionable towards some,

21:36.920 --> 21:43.080
you know, directionality in one's life, something that I think I could use more of,

21:43.080 --> 21:47.320
and me being like a product of the culture that I've been, you know, grown in.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.760
I've heard you mentioned before, and then it caused me to look it up that the

21:52.760 --> 21:57.560
Plato's transcendentals, the three transcendentals is beauty, goodness and truth is what I've

21:57.560 --> 22:06.760
read on the internet. And that I think is something that is, is kind of can easily be

22:06.760 --> 22:12.520
forgotten in the modern era, to pick on the modern era. You know, and that's like I just

22:12.520 --> 22:17.000
got back from Greece, thankfully, it was really like an exceptional experience. And we went to

22:17.000 --> 22:22.040
various different islands there and, you know, learned about the God of Sculpeyus, the God of

22:22.040 --> 22:27.480
medicine and the way that they approached medicine. And the way that they approached medicine, one

22:27.480 --> 22:34.120
theaters were, were built beside or very close to hospitals, which I thought was very interesting.

22:34.120 --> 22:39.960
So that concept of theater was like an entrenched within medicine. And when you enter into the

22:39.960 --> 22:45.320
hospital, it was, it was really beautiful. And there was, there was art, and you'd get into,

22:45.320 --> 22:49.640
you know, a body of water and you, you know, cold plunge and hot tub. And, you know, there was,

22:49.640 --> 22:57.480
it was, and what that, the way that the tour guides described to me was through art that,

22:57.560 --> 23:04.840
like that, that the emotive power of art and also senses, you know, so like Tantra in a way,

23:04.840 --> 23:10.360
you could say maybe that kind of softens up and opens up some space within, like the tour guide

23:10.360 --> 23:14.440
said, like the soul, you know, so whatever, whatever word you want to put that deeper part.

23:15.160 --> 23:22.840
And I feel like in the modern era, there's a bit of a jump to just what is the physical

23:22.840 --> 23:28.520
expression. Now let's like attack that physical expression, as opposed to allowing spaciousness

23:29.080 --> 23:34.840
and using some of these softer tactics to kind of go through and, and, and open up some space to be

23:34.840 --> 23:41.880
able to get into like what night, what lies beneath that outer physical expression. So that's

23:41.880 --> 23:47.800
something I think that was very wordy. But essentially, the question or curiosity is, is

23:48.760 --> 23:54.440
from your perception, what do you see that the value in Plato's three transcendentals,

23:54.440 --> 24:01.320
beauty, goodness and truth in supporting us as modern people, at least from like a medical

24:01.320 --> 24:07.000
perspective? I think you're definitely onto something and you, you understand, it's a good

24:07.000 --> 24:13.160
way to understand the moment in which we are now, that is, right now, we, we have the, we have exactly

24:13.160 --> 24:17.800
this idea that if we're treating the, the body, like if someone's sick, we're just going to treat

24:17.800 --> 24:25.640
the body. So we bring someone to horrendous place, like our horrendous place of fluorescent lights,

24:25.640 --> 24:32.920
you know, and, and green plastic things and, you know, and metal bars that metal beds that

24:32.920 --> 24:41.640
look like prison bars. And that's where we bring people to heal because crazy. We think that it's

24:41.640 --> 24:46.360
like, well, it's just, it's just like, it's just a car, right? We're just fixing a car.

24:46.360 --> 24:49.240
So we're going to, we're going to bring someone, we're going to, we're going to put them in

24:49.240 --> 24:52.920
the rooms with several people, and we're going to, we're going to embarrass them, have them,

24:52.920 --> 24:58.200
you know, wear these horrible nightgowns or whatever. Like everything about it is this

24:58.200 --> 25:06.360
reduction of the human person to, to a machine. And that's exactly the problem. That's exactly

25:06.360 --> 25:11.000
the problem that, that we mentioned a little earlier, which is that with the return of something

25:11.080 --> 25:18.040
like cognitive science, we're realizing that no, you can't pretend like there is no experience of

25:18.040 --> 25:24.200
the world and that that experience of the world doesn't participate in, in your, in, in, in,

25:24.200 --> 25:29.160
in the medical, in your healing. Like the, for example, the placebo effect is a great example,

25:29.160 --> 25:35.160
right? So we believe every medical doctor believes that there's a placebo effect to medicine,

25:35.800 --> 25:42.520
but they try to reduce that effect as much as possible because they want to reduce you to a

25:42.520 --> 25:49.080
machine. And if you could prove that augmenting the placebo effect could actually help you heal

25:49.080 --> 25:56.600
faster, they don't care because they don't like that idea. They don't like the idea that, that

25:56.600 --> 26:02.440
mind, that experience participates in, in your, in your experience. And so when they look at

26:02.440 --> 26:07.640
ancient medicine and they see the ritualization, they see the drama, like you said, in, in relationship

26:07.640 --> 26:13.560
to the medical practice, they think it's all hocus pocus nonsense, but they still believe that

26:13.560 --> 26:18.920
there's, that there's a placebo effect. It's hilarious. It's like, why wouldn't you, why

26:18.920 --> 26:26.600
couldn't you use the best of medicine and then create a ritualized drama of practice in which

26:26.680 --> 26:33.560
you would enter into the medical relationship as, you know, as a, like you said, like as a, as a

26:33.560 --> 26:39.400
being and counting beauty, it's not possible. Like our world is too gone, at least for now,

26:39.400 --> 26:44.760
it's too gone for that. So we're stuck with these horrible cement parking garages that are called

26:44.760 --> 26:50.680
hospitals. Yeah, I wonder anytime someone uses the, the term they, I always, my mind always

26:50.680 --> 26:56.680
jumps to like, who is they? And then also want is another curiosity. Like I don't know that

26:56.680 --> 27:02.920
I'd love for you to define they in, in relation to that statement. And then also drawing back on,

27:02.920 --> 27:11.960
on want. So they want to reduce us to a machine. It feels to me kind of just like it is reducing

27:12.840 --> 27:19.480
itself to a machine. So what is the it now in this way? It would be the zeitgeist,

27:19.480 --> 27:23.320
like the totality of culture moving together. And then we have these individual nodes that

27:23.320 --> 27:27.400
pop up and they're wearing, you know, a lab coat and their names, Dr. Sanders or whatever.

27:27.400 --> 27:32.760
All right, so let's, let's, let's frame it this way. So the movement, the same movement which

27:32.760 --> 27:41.640
moved against religio and described religio as being hocus pocus magic and, and superstition

27:42.600 --> 27:49.880
and ridiculous things people did or things people did that were imposed by power and, and, and

27:49.880 --> 27:55.640
and patriarchy or whatever, however you want to describe it, this, the same, let's say narrative,

27:55.640 --> 28:00.520
you could call it like the worst of the enlightenment narrative, the worst of the, of the

28:00.520 --> 28:07.640
materialist scientific narrative that narrative leads at the same time to parking garage hospitals.

28:08.520 --> 28:14.200
You know, because, because there's a coherence in the reduction of everything to its material

28:14.200 --> 28:20.440
causes that brings about, you know, the, the, the, the medical establishment that we're,

28:20.440 --> 28:24.840
that we're dealing with. And so it's, of course, it's a side effect. Like I don't think that

28:25.400 --> 28:29.880
Locke and Hobbs thought that we would get to where we are. I don't think that they would,

28:29.880 --> 28:36.760
that they, that they could have predicted that their ideas about, about rationality and Occam's

28:36.760 --> 28:41.400
razor and, you know, there's these scientific revolutions that we went through would lead us

28:41.400 --> 28:50.600
to a kind of dehumanized machine body. But that is what happened in the, in those causes.

28:52.520 --> 28:57.320
But like I said, I do think so it's, you're right, when I say they, I don't mean, I can't, I can't,

28:57.320 --> 29:01.160
it's not the doctors, it's not their fault. It's not, it's not the, it's not even the medical

29:01.160 --> 29:08.920
establishment's fault at this point. But it is a movement, like it is a, it is a line that you

29:08.920 --> 29:13.400
can draw from certain changes which happened in history, which brought us to this point.

29:14.440 --> 29:23.000
But at the same time, I do think that seeing that now, there are possibilities of, of alternatives.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.240
It's harder in the medical world, but there are other places where you can, where you can,

29:27.240 --> 29:32.120
where someone can do that. For example, the same thing with schools, like schools are basically,

29:32.120 --> 29:36.760
you know, they're factories for children, like they're, they're just factories pumping out children

29:36.760 --> 29:44.280
into the world. Now that, there's a place where you can, where someone can find better alternatives,

29:44.280 --> 29:50.840
you know, homeschool, private schools, whatever, schools that are more integrative and integrate

29:51.400 --> 29:57.160
storytelling and culture and ritual and practice into, into a child's life rather than just have

29:57.160 --> 30:04.440
them go through the system. But medical stuff is harder because it's so, so big and there's such a,

30:05.480 --> 30:11.720
yeah. And there's also cranks, like that, a real cranks that exist in that, in that world of healing

30:11.720 --> 30:18.040
too. It feels to me when I say like the they and like, you know, the it and all that as opposed to,

30:18.040 --> 30:22.280
to personalizing an individual, having any type of intention, which that's a question

30:22.920 --> 30:28.360
I have as, as well as like how much sovereignty do we have in our choices? And how much are we just

30:28.360 --> 30:32.680
a part of this collective consciousness? And we're just, you know, a barrel of water just sloshing

30:32.680 --> 30:39.560
about, you know, within that, if we are just this sloshing, sloshing barrel of water really works as

30:39.560 --> 30:44.120
an analogy, but I'll try to force it. No, but I said what you mean, like we're just in the current,

30:44.120 --> 30:51.000
like we're just going down stream. And there's not much we can do, we can notice that this isn't

30:51.080 --> 30:57.080
pleasant, but it's not easy to understand how to go, how to go upstream. Like it's just not that

30:57.080 --> 31:06.040
simple. Yeah. And so it feels to me like perhaps since the, at one point there was more, you know,

31:06.040 --> 31:12.840
nature worship and animism and, and, you know, probably more like matriarchal societies were

31:12.840 --> 31:19.000
more common and things of the sort. And then there was a shift. So the, the metaphoric

31:19.880 --> 31:27.640
water sloshing about going to one side. And then I feel like, you know, I'll say like maybe Cartesian

31:27.640 --> 31:32.920
times or Newtonian times and kind of entering into like, aha, no, like scientism. This is the

31:32.920 --> 31:38.040
solution, you know, and pragmatism and everything needs to be rationalized. And I need to be able

31:38.040 --> 31:45.240
to hold it and measure it. And that is truth. I don't know that culture as a whole is like, aha,

31:45.240 --> 31:50.280
like, yes, I think it's, it feels to me kind of, it's just like a pendulum swinging. And right now

31:50.280 --> 31:55.000
we're kind of, I don't know where we're at. If it is a pendulum swinging, I don't know where on the

31:55.000 --> 32:03.880
swing we are, but we're certainly in some pragmatic reductionist rational swing phase. And it feels

32:03.960 --> 32:10.520
like there's a yearning to kind of find some center or maybe wildly swing back to the other side.

32:11.160 --> 32:15.560
Yeah. Well, there's, you could, I think you could see the extremes at the same time. So I think

32:16.200 --> 32:22.120
that's probably the best way to understand, especially the modern, like the modern world

32:22.120 --> 32:26.920
is to understand it as extremes manifesting themselves. There is a bit of a pendulum, but

32:26.920 --> 32:32.200
you can also see it happening at the same time. So if you look at the, in the rationalism right

32:32.200 --> 32:36.760
after the rational, like the hyper-rationalist phase was romanticism and symbolism and the

32:36.760 --> 32:44.200
kind of degenerate symbolic thinking that we saw, you know, in the 18th, 19th century,

32:44.200 --> 32:50.440
which was about fantastical imagination, all that stuff, you know, and the occultism that came

32:50.440 --> 32:55.880
with that type of thinking as well. So if you look at the modern world is both the rationalism,

32:55.880 --> 33:01.880
hyper-rationalism and all that stuff, but it's also like weird occultism and, you know,

33:01.880 --> 33:08.360
Crowley and the return of witchcraft and Lovatsky and Theosophy and all that kind of,

33:08.920 --> 33:14.360
that other side of modernity, which happens at the same time. So right now we could see that

33:14.360 --> 33:19.720
the internet is a great example. The internet is a mix of hyper-rationality and control and,

33:19.720 --> 33:26.280
you know, like furry avatars in the metaverse, which is like complete explosion of rationality

33:26.280 --> 33:35.160
into idiosyncrasy in ways that you could never, ever imagine in the past. Like you can be anything

33:35.160 --> 33:41.240
that you can possibly imagine in the metaverse, but that's also, that's happening at the same

33:41.240 --> 33:47.160
time as this hyper-rational kind of strange control. And so I think that's probably the best

33:47.160 --> 33:51.480
way because it's hard to, it would be hard to understand our moment if we didn't see those

33:51.480 --> 33:55.960
two things happening at the same time. And I'd like to at some point probably try to draw back

33:55.960 --> 34:01.160
to some kind of like ashmole, what can we do type scenario. But something that I was listening to

34:01.160 --> 34:07.000
your podcast with Makayla Peterson in preparation to this one. And one of the things that I heard

34:07.000 --> 34:13.000
her saying throughout that seemed like she was kind of like at least acknowledging with herself

34:13.000 --> 34:20.200
historically speaking, and seems like a little bit present as well, leaning towards like rationality

34:20.200 --> 34:25.560
and logic and pragmatism as like a safe haven. And I think that that's very common. Like I can,

34:25.560 --> 34:31.320
I can notice that with myself. And I think many, many people we can oftentimes not projecting

34:31.320 --> 34:36.040
any of this on hers or something I noticed now, like just back to speaking about me. I think I

34:36.040 --> 34:44.600
can lean on pragmatism as a way because I feel like there's almost like a fear of chaos.

34:46.200 --> 34:49.640
And that deeper underpart, you know, like there's a quote that I

34:50.520 --> 34:54.840
from Marianne Williamson, who I've also had on here. So our deepest fear is not

34:54.840 --> 34:58.200
that we are inadequate, our deepest fears that we are powerful beyond measure.

34:59.160 --> 35:04.040
And I feel like that, that undercurrent, that underpart that sometimes I think in this,

35:04.040 --> 35:10.520
in this modern era, that's kind of, it can be like masked by rationale and science and logic

35:10.520 --> 35:15.240
and imperial research. And it's not a thing until it's been studied and all the peers have reviewed

35:15.240 --> 35:21.080
it. And then we can start to like actually have a conversation. But there's also this welling,

35:21.080 --> 35:29.480
this well beneath that it's like, oh, like, perhaps access to, you know, all the power and

35:29.480 --> 35:35.240
answers to, you know, every, everything you could possibly imagine. But I feel like there's a little

35:35.240 --> 35:41.080
bit almost like of a, for me, I can notice like, like almost like a fear or resistance around that

35:41.080 --> 35:47.160
part. And so I'll just lean on science and lean on rationality and lean on, you know, because I

35:47.160 --> 35:53.720
don't want to kind of touch the chaos of what's inside. Yeah, but I also think that it's important,

35:53.720 --> 35:58.360
this is something that is difficult because unions are popular right now, I guess, in part because

35:58.360 --> 36:04.360
of Jordan Peterson. But there's a tendency to confuse two things, like there's, there's a

36:04.360 --> 36:11.080
trans rational space. And there's a pre rational space or, you know, there's something like this

36:11.720 --> 36:15.560
subconscious, you could say, there's something like super consciousness and those,

36:16.360 --> 36:22.120
they can look the same to people that are just trapped in consciousness. But if you read any

36:22.120 --> 36:28.680
traditional text from any religion, they clearly demarcate those as not being the same. And so

36:28.680 --> 36:36.920
the kind of chaos, the dream kind of chaos that that kind of emotional, romantic feeling that you

36:36.920 --> 36:45.800
get is not the same as the sense that things culminate into a unity, which is beyond the

36:45.800 --> 36:52.280
particulars, right, that there's this drive up towards something which is pulling me beyond

36:52.280 --> 36:58.440
the world. Now, I understand why it can seem like sometimes it's the same in your experience, but

36:59.240 --> 37:05.160
there's a, you could understand the rationality or the rational world is, is this like buffered

37:05.160 --> 37:11.000
space that exists between those two poles, something which is pulling you up towards,

37:11.880 --> 37:18.360
you could say the way to understand it would be that as an individual, for example, right,

37:18.360 --> 37:25.080
if you give yourself to a higher cause, right, that higher cause is not in the individual,

37:25.080 --> 37:31.880
it's not, it's not there. So if you take the world of the individual and you analyze it every

37:31.880 --> 37:37.000
single aspect of it, you're never going to get the highest cause to which you're willing to sacrifice

37:37.000 --> 37:43.480
yourself for. Does that make sense? And so now think of that for everything, like there's a world

37:43.480 --> 37:49.480
of structured causality, but that world of structured causality gives itself up towards

37:50.600 --> 37:56.200
higher participations, you could say. And then there's also a way in which it dissolves into

37:56.200 --> 38:01.720
nothingness. So you as an individual, let's say the manner in which you could dissolve into all

38:01.720 --> 38:06.920
kinds of idiosyncratic bad habits or passions or the way you could become obsessed with things and

38:07.000 --> 38:11.480
kind of devolve into something which is not rational at all, right? It's like there's nothing,

38:12.760 --> 38:17.720
if you, once, if you analyze you becoming addicted to things, you realize this is not

38:17.720 --> 38:23.400
rational. Like this is, this is, this is breaking me apart. It's fragmenting me completely. But

38:23.400 --> 38:28.440
that is different from this giving up, you could say, the way in which you participate. I don't

38:28.440 --> 38:33.560
know if that makes sense. It's important, I think, because people are right now are so confused. They

38:33.560 --> 38:37.800
think that spirituality is, sometimes they think that spirituality is this lower stuff

38:37.800 --> 38:44.280
down here. Like it's about feeling and about, you know, how I, you know, how I, how I feel about

38:44.280 --> 38:49.400
myself or how I feel about others or these like, these kind of vague intuitions that you get about,

38:49.400 --> 38:57.320
about, about things. But the world, the higher world or the world of spiritual participation is

38:57.880 --> 39:05.000
in some ways it, it's trans-rational. But once you grasp it, it's super clear. Like it's,

39:05.640 --> 39:10.920
right? It's like the clearest thing you'll ever see. It appears as a, as a beacon of, of light

39:10.920 --> 39:16.600
that's kind of guiding you beyond your limited world. Yeah. The, the only issue I have with

39:16.600 --> 39:22.840
the idea of like higher and, and lower and placing a hierarchy on states of consciousness and like

39:22.840 --> 39:30.920
aspects of, I don't know, existence life is, I think there can be a fragmentation or divorcing

39:30.920 --> 39:35.960
or separation within self through that separation and the idea that something is higher than something

39:35.960 --> 39:42.840
else. I understand why you say that, but it's also because this is the issue, the problem of

39:43.400 --> 39:49.080
like equalizing everything is that hierarchies don't compete with their levels. That is that

39:49.160 --> 39:55.480
if you are a healthy individual and all your thoughts and your passions are joined together,

39:57.160 --> 40:03.880
then you will actually become the best part of a higher participation. So you will actually be a

40:03.880 --> 40:11.000
better member of your family if you are united in that, in the, in the individual part. And so

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
it doesn't compete. That's what cults do. Cults, you want to know the difference between a real

40:15.000 --> 40:22.760
religion and a cult? A cult will try to compete with lower levels of participation. Like a cult

40:22.760 --> 40:28.360
will say you have to deny your family. You have to deny all these lower participation. And so it's

40:28.360 --> 40:33.800
the same with like a, it's the same with any hierarchy of, of anything, right? So if you,

40:35.080 --> 40:43.400
if you understand, for example, that love is the highest virtue, right? And so you can also

40:43.400 --> 40:49.000
understand that being good at something at a lower scale, it doesn't compete with that. So you could

40:49.000 --> 40:53.560
be good at your job, but that if you're good at your job, I don't know, like if you're good at,

40:54.200 --> 41:00.840
at making shoes, it's like that good can embed itself in love because you can do it in a way

41:00.840 --> 41:04.760
that serves your community or you could do it in a way that's selfish and is just to fill your

41:04.760 --> 41:11.320
pockets. But, but there's a manner in which those goods that scale up, they actually don't compete

41:11.320 --> 41:17.240
with each other. They fit into each other like of this beautiful fractal dance, right? Everything

41:17.240 --> 41:22.840
kind of embeds itself into, into the rest. They're probably some way to literally define

41:23.560 --> 41:28.680
the experience of love being like a higher vibratory state. And then within that, it's like,

41:30.440 --> 41:37.000
maybe, maybe you could relate it to like spectrums of light. And there's been kind of a war against

41:37.000 --> 41:40.840
blue light recently. I don't know if you, if you pay attention to things of this sort, like

41:42.120 --> 41:45.720
yeah, exactly, exactly, like where your blue blockers, you know, like the blue light, it's

41:45.720 --> 41:52.120
bad, you know, and it's like, no, no, no, no, it's not bad. It's just one frequency that serves a

41:52.120 --> 41:59.800
purpose. It's just serves a purpose at, at specific time for specific functions, you know, and so

41:59.800 --> 42:05.400
low, low frequency light and that, you know, infrareds and reds and oranges and all that stuff

42:05.400 --> 42:12.120
incredibly valuable. Really high frequency light, you know, the blues and all that, like that's like

42:12.120 --> 42:19.000
really valuable. And when, if we're playing the game where like, oh, I'm, I'm tribe blue light and

42:19.000 --> 42:23.800
like, no, no, no, I'm tribe orange light or red light, you know, this is better. It's more healthy.

42:23.800 --> 42:30.200
It's like, well, the, the, going back to like the original derivative of health, health comes back to

42:30.280 --> 42:36.440
wholeness. So again, like all of this comes back to like, okay, how do we get, if, if what one's

42:36.440 --> 42:42.600
intention is a sensation, probably of, I don't know, like cellular function, you know, and, and

42:43.240 --> 42:50.440
satisfaction, probably the conjoining of all of the tribes and being able to actually be able to see

42:51.160 --> 42:57.160
that there really is value in, in all of it and not kind of casting any of it out, but actually

42:57.240 --> 43:00.440
coming through, I'm kind of going out into the weeds here, but I think, I think there's the

43:00.440 --> 43:07.320
availability to perceive everything through that lens of, of love and acceptance, but not necessarily

43:07.320 --> 43:12.440
swallow the pill entirely and say, okay, I'm going to see this state or frequency or whatever

43:12.440 --> 43:16.440
through love and acceptance. So I'm just going to become that and that is all of me. Like I'm able

43:16.440 --> 43:24.600
to actually absorb and be with all things, but not get trapped in the kind of the tribalistic

43:25.560 --> 43:29.800
thing that tends to happen where we start to create more segregation, more isolation,

43:29.800 --> 43:35.480
and then oftentimes it's in the guise of some higher power. The idea, so in Dante, for example,

43:35.480 --> 43:42.600
you see the way that he presents things is perfect. He says that all, let's say, all sin is something

43:42.600 --> 43:50.520
like misplaced love or too much love or too little love or not, or love that is kind of twisted.

43:50.520 --> 43:57.160
And so the idea is that all things are good if they're properly aligned. Like nothing is bad

43:57.160 --> 44:01.160
in itself. That's ridiculous. Like it's not a, that's definitely not a Christian way of seeing

44:01.160 --> 44:06.440
the world. All things are good and that they just have to be in their proper place. So the

44:06.440 --> 44:11.080
urinality of light is a good example. Like, well, obviously, blue light isn't bad. It's, it's just

44:11.080 --> 44:18.120
that it has to, it has to be in the proper proportion for what a human being is. And you

44:18.600 --> 44:24.280
could say that about things that are maybe, maybe more human, for example. So you could imagine

44:24.280 --> 44:30.440
something like entertainment is, is entertainment good or is entertainment bad? And you could say,

44:30.440 --> 44:36.360
well, entertainment is good if it's in the proper proportion to other things in your life that are,

44:36.360 --> 44:42.920
that are aimed towards, towards bringing all things together in the good. But if you live a

44:42.920 --> 44:48.680
life of just entertainment, right? It's like saying is eating dessert bad? It's not bad if,

44:49.400 --> 44:55.960
if it's properly ordered, but if you just eat dessert nonstop, then you're going to get sick.

44:55.960 --> 44:59.880
Like it's actually going to affect you. And if you just spend your whole day watching movies and

44:59.880 --> 45:04.840
playing video games, then it's actually going to, it's actually going to affect you. But the other

45:04.840 --> 45:09.080
one is true as well. Right? If you spend your whole day working, if you spend your whole day

45:09.080 --> 45:14.760
doing whatever it is that you do without giving room for the things that are, that are also good,

45:14.760 --> 45:19.240
then you will, then you, you'll have the same problem from the other side. Well, you're,

45:19.240 --> 45:24.280
you're going to become like someone who's super strict with themselves that doesn't leave any

45:24.280 --> 45:30.360
room for some play, let's say in terms of personal discipline, is going to crack. Like they're just,

45:30.360 --> 45:36.360
at some point they crack and they, they, they kind of collapse. Yeah. There's another, I'll be less

45:36.360 --> 45:40.280
quotacious after this, I think, but there's another quote from Victor Frankel. He said,

45:41.240 --> 45:45.080
something like paraphrase, some long lines of, of those who lack purpose will seek

45:45.080 --> 45:50.440
pleasure instead as like a replacement. And I think that kind of turns into like this,

45:50.440 --> 45:55.960
this like hungry ghost type sensation, like this ongoing reaching out for those little hits.

45:57.400 --> 46:00.840
Yeah. Now, because there's that, that lack of foundation of like

46:01.560 --> 46:06.840
actually feeling held and supported in a part of a fabric of something bigger than just this self.

46:07.400 --> 46:11.880
Yeah. Well, you could say that that's the, so the drug epidemic in the, in the North America is,

46:12.600 --> 46:18.120
seems to be really a product of the meaning crisis, like a product of people not having

46:18.120 --> 46:23.720
direction and purpose. And so kind of spiraling into exactly what you said into this,

46:25.000 --> 46:29.320
this more and more extreme desire to, to, to feel something, you know.

46:29.320 --> 46:31.080
Yeah, we just want to feel. Yeah.

46:32.040 --> 46:35.400
How do you, how are you with feeling? Do you feel like, where are you with all these

46:35.400 --> 46:41.320
conversations? Like, do you, do you have like a, like any type of, of like,

46:41.320 --> 46:45.800
unquenched yearning sensations that, that I experienced, for example?

46:45.800 --> 46:51.000
Oh, of course. I think that's really part of being human, you know? I mean, it's just,

46:51.000 --> 46:57.080
of course that happens. And, and I think that it's also, if you're conscious about it and you're

46:57.080 --> 47:03.400
aware of it, then you can also realize what it is that, what that's for. Now, I think especially

47:03.400 --> 47:09.560
sexual desire, the thing that once we, you know, one of the things that happened, right,

47:09.560 --> 47:14.440
in the sixties and then ongoing from there, but there were ways of that before and kind of decadent

47:14.440 --> 47:20.600
end of century times is that we had this sense that if we could just satisfy our sexual desires

47:20.600 --> 47:25.560
and proclivities, then, you know, everybody would get along and we'd all be happy. But it turns out

47:25.560 --> 47:33.400
that if you focus on that, then it's an unlimited source of frustration because your desires just

47:33.400 --> 47:38.920
get more and more idiosyncratic and bigger and bigger and more and more, you know, you need more

47:38.920 --> 47:43.000
in order to feel, it's almost like it's the same as drugs. Like, it's like, you need more

47:43.000 --> 47:48.760
in order to feel taken further, you could say. The hedonic, the hedonic treadmill.

47:48.760 --> 47:53.480
Exactly. And so if, what, but if you realize that, then you're like, okay, well, you know,

47:54.440 --> 47:59.960
how am I going to deal with this? Right? So this, so for example, marriage is a good way to do it

47:59.960 --> 48:04.280
because it's hard to do it on your own. It's really hard because it's like, but if you're married to

48:04.280 --> 48:11.960
someone that you love, that person will act as both a, to take a place for your sexual desire,

48:11.960 --> 48:16.280
but also a limit to your sexual desire because it's one person. And it's like,

48:17.240 --> 48:21.880
that person has a limit. Like they have a sexual, they have, especially, especially for men, like

48:21.960 --> 48:25.160
if you're married to a woman, like that woman has a certain limit at some point, it's going to

48:25.160 --> 48:30.120
start manifesting itself. And so then you were like, okay, so that feeling, then you feel it,

48:30.120 --> 48:36.520
right? Then you feel that, you feel that longing or you feel that lack or that whole that it's

48:36.520 --> 48:41.560
causing in you. And then you can realize too, but you can realize that actually the problem

48:41.560 --> 48:46.440
is that the sex doesn't fill that hole. It's, it's fine. There's nothing wrong with sex. Like,

48:46.520 --> 48:52.040
sex is great, but it's never going to fill that hole completely because that hole keeps getting

48:52.040 --> 48:56.360
bigger for some reason. It just keeps getting, or more weird and more, you know, idiosyncratic.

48:56.920 --> 49:01.720
And so that's, I think that's the real idea of sublimation, you could say. Where it's like,

49:01.720 --> 49:10.280
you realize, wait a minute, that suffering and that longing is energy. It's actual, it's actual

49:10.280 --> 49:19.160
fuel. And if, and I can redirect that fuel towards other things, and you don't even realize that

49:19.160 --> 49:25.640
you, that that exists until you feel it, right? If you're just always kind of somewhat satisfied,

49:25.640 --> 49:31.880
you're not going to realize that the, this longing, this longing that you have can be redirected,

49:31.880 --> 49:37.880
and it can be redirected towards projects. It can be redirected towards, you know,

49:37.880 --> 49:42.920
accomplishing some great task. It can be redirected towards prayer. It can be redirected

49:42.920 --> 49:50.360
in all kinds of directions. And then you, then you can see almost what that longing is for,

49:50.360 --> 49:56.520
actually. So definitely, of course, I have, I have that. And I hope that I'm

49:57.160 --> 50:03.080
doing as much as possible to make it, to make it fruitful, to make that longing fruitful.

50:03.080 --> 50:10.840
How often do you misdirect that energy into like self-destruction and burning yourself up?

50:10.840 --> 50:16.920
Yeah, probably all the time, in little ways. I mean, like little moments, it's not, it's not

50:16.920 --> 50:23.880
like big things, but like little moments where you, you have a frustration or you have a sense that,

50:23.880 --> 50:28.120
you know, you're not getting what you should in terms of care. I mean, it's not just sex, but it's

50:28.120 --> 50:33.640
like, in terms of love, in terms of attention, in terms of this, like, you can feel that every day,

50:33.640 --> 50:38.280
if you're, if you're careful to how you, especially when you're in a family and you,

50:38.280 --> 50:44.120
you have all these dynamics. So I would say it happens quite a bit, but, but it's, it's like

50:44.120 --> 50:49.240
these little moments where you kind of have to, you have to wake up, you know, and then until

50:49.240 --> 50:54.920
you wake up, then you, you end up in these spirals of frustration. But yeah, definitely. I mean,

50:55.400 --> 51:01.880
I'm a human being, so it happens quite a bit. The sex one, I think, is especially interesting,

51:02.760 --> 51:12.440
because it seems clear that from an evolutionary perspective, it would make sense for humans to

51:12.440 --> 51:18.200
yearn to have sex with more than one person. Like, you know, spread the seeds, spread the species,

51:18.200 --> 51:22.040
spread the genetics. What else, you know, what else are we going to do? Yeah. You know, and,

51:22.040 --> 51:28.280
and, you know, build shelter, you know, weather the storm, spread your genes, hunt, do it over again.

51:28.280 --> 51:35.560
Yeah. And then there's like this, you know, this kind of new world that we exist in and nuclear

51:35.560 --> 51:43.560
families and the social contracts and, you know, agreements that kind of in a way sits on top,

51:43.560 --> 51:49.240
but also we're working on integrating the two to make it be whole, make it like be health,

51:49.320 --> 51:55.480
make it be, you know, religio, make it, you know, all of that. But it feels almost like there's two

51:55.480 --> 52:01.880
intersecting tracks in that, like your, your, your primal carnal urges to spread the genes.

52:01.880 --> 52:07.720
Yep. And then, you know, like from a, from an evolutionary perspective, males would be

52:09.000 --> 52:13.320
sexually selected based off of those that like the Genghis Khan's of the world would be more

52:13.320 --> 52:18.760
spread. But it's your, your insight is great. It's great, but it's important to understand it,

52:19.320 --> 52:25.240
that, that it's important to understand it in terms of these higher goods that we talk about.

52:25.240 --> 52:29.800
Right. And so sexuality is probably the easiest way or the best way to understand it,

52:29.800 --> 52:38.440
which is that at some point we understand that we have to give up that, some of that,

52:38.440 --> 52:45.880
for something which binds us at a higher level. And actually that would be necessary at any,

52:45.880 --> 52:51.720
at any scale, like it would be necessary if you just had one male, like in the human species,

52:51.720 --> 52:57.480
if you just had one male that was mating with all the women and there, and the other males had no

52:57.480 --> 53:05.320
access to women, you would have carnage. If you would just have fighting all the time. And, and,

53:05.960 --> 53:12.360
and the truth is that like people idealize hunter-gatherer societies, but you can imagine

53:12.360 --> 53:17.560
that people were fighting all the time. And I've been in contact with, with groups that aren't

53:17.560 --> 53:24.520
necessarily hunter-gatherers, but have more of that kind of ancient pagan way of being. And that's

53:24.520 --> 53:31.560
what happens. People fight over girls non-stop. They fight over women all the time. And people will

53:31.560 --> 53:37.400
kill for women, you know. And so this is something which is, and so there's a sense in which you

53:37.400 --> 53:43.080
can understand that giving up some of that desire towards higher participation in a society,

53:43.800 --> 53:50.280
you can understand that that's fractal, that that's also what you do in you, which is that

53:51.000 --> 53:58.760
you realize, oh, if I just focus on pleasure, then I'm not going to be able to

53:59.720 --> 54:05.480
accomplish my goals. And so I have to sacrifice some of that. And I have to redirect it towards

54:05.480 --> 54:09.880
something higher, which I perceive as higher, as a, as a higher good. It doesn't mean that

54:09.880 --> 54:15.640
those desires are bad or that pleasure is bad. None of that is bad. But I do have to concentrate it

54:15.640 --> 54:20.120
and re, reorient it. And then I realize, wait a minute, actually what I get from

54:21.080 --> 54:28.520
above, when I, what I get from that is really valuable. And the kind of pleasure that I get,

54:28.600 --> 54:35.080
let's say, the pleasure of accomplishing something or the pleasure of, of intellectual,

54:35.640 --> 54:40.920
intellectual understanding, it's a, it's subtle. It's more subtle than an orgasm.

54:41.640 --> 54:48.520
But it calls you like it, it calls you and it has a, it has a force that I think that,

54:48.520 --> 54:53.800
especially as you get older, like if when you're like 17, it's hard to argue with that with someone

54:53.800 --> 54:59.320
who's like just exploding with, with testosterone. But like, as you kind of get into your thirties

54:59.320 --> 55:04.360
and you, you kind of get older, you start to see how actually giving up towards these higher

55:04.360 --> 55:12.440
participations, they offer you a type of pleasure, which is very different, but is,

55:13.480 --> 55:21.320
but is maybe even more valuable. Yeah. My buddy I've had on here called Chris Williamson. I feel

55:21.320 --> 55:25.320
like you guys have maybe, have you done the modern wisdom podcast Chris Williamson? I don't think so.

55:25.320 --> 55:30.760
Anyways, he's sweet. A term that I got from him is, is post nut clarity.

55:35.480 --> 55:41.160
And everything you're saying is true. Yeah. Post ejaculation. Yeah. Yeah. To be able to like

55:41.160 --> 55:46.600
sacrifice that like the before, I feel like this kind of comes into, comes back to like,

55:46.680 --> 55:53.160
you know, probably a lot of religious philosophies or, or religions or ideologies,

55:53.160 --> 55:59.560
but like, like the value of, of sacrifice, you know, and God sacrificing his only son,

55:59.560 --> 56:05.080
you know, on the cross to save us all from his sins. And like, yeah, like the, the ethics within

56:05.080 --> 56:10.920
that, like they, they, they're, they've been around for a while. And it seems like, so that's

56:10.920 --> 56:16.840
kind of at a more macro, you know, like God level. And then individually, I think we can

56:16.840 --> 56:22.360
experience that as well. And then I think that's where there is value. But let me give you just

56:22.360 --> 56:26.920
an example based on what you just said, which is that think about, like when I say giving yourself

56:26.920 --> 56:31.960
to a higher good. So think about you're in a situation and you could sleep with your friend's

56:31.960 --> 56:36.760
girlfriend, like she's up for it, but you know the consequence of that, right? You know what

56:36.760 --> 56:44.600
that's going to cost you. And so you decide that actually the friendship I have, my friend,

56:45.560 --> 56:52.760
is more valuable than the immediate pleasure. And so you sacrifice that moment, that possibility

56:53.320 --> 57:00.440
in order to be bound to a relationship, right? So you can imagine that at multiple levels,

57:00.440 --> 57:04.600
like that kind of decision. That's the kind of decision that I'm talking about, which is that

57:05.560 --> 57:12.680
you're actually, you're sacrificing immediate, I mean, it's just like delayed satisfaction. But

57:12.680 --> 57:17.080
I mean, you can think of it even at a higher level, which is not just that you delay it for later,

57:17.080 --> 57:24.200
you're giving it up towards something higher, something more that is less bodily pleasure,

57:24.200 --> 57:27.960
but it is a more kind of spiritual pleasure, you could say.

57:28.440 --> 57:35.800
So we're not going to have enough time to actually go into the Bible and religion

57:35.800 --> 57:41.480
in the way that I would like to, because I was raised very Christian doing Bible study,

57:41.480 --> 57:48.920
hanging out with my bros, talking about Jesus, sharing scriptures and such, then got into psychedelics

57:48.920 --> 57:56.200
and kind of Buddhism and like other versions of isms and that kind of the concept of like hell

57:56.200 --> 58:07.080
seems quite unreasonable. So I wonder your perspective on the, how literal could one take

58:07.080 --> 58:14.440
the Bible from your perspective? Like, is it meant to be symbolism, metaphor, allegory,

58:14.440 --> 58:20.040
is it meant to be 100% literal? How does one define how literal the Bible is?

58:20.680 --> 58:25.160
So or the Quran or the literal thing, I hate that word.

58:26.600 --> 58:31.480
First of all, the word literal means according to the text, like that's what the word literal

58:31.480 --> 58:40.440
means. People think that the word literal means that what is described is a description of events

58:41.160 --> 58:46.120
in the way that I think events should be described. And sometimes I'm not even sure what that is.

58:46.120 --> 58:49.160
It's like the way that you would describe events to a police officer, maybe,

58:49.160 --> 58:55.800
like if it was the scene of a crime, some kind of forensic, like encyclopedic description of

58:55.800 --> 59:01.400
an event, like that's what it should be. And so we think that when we say the Bible is literal,

59:01.400 --> 59:08.040
then that's what we're describing. And I think that that's just not what's going on there.

59:08.040 --> 59:14.920
The Bible is definitely a description of events, but it's not trying to describe those events

59:15.000 --> 59:22.360
in a way that would satisfy a modern rationalist in any way. Like it is a description of events

59:22.360 --> 59:29.720
which compresses elements together in order to make them meaningful over a very long span of time.

59:30.520 --> 59:37.080
And so because of that, they have a certain form and a certain trope, which is necessary,

59:37.080 --> 59:43.000
because if you don't do that, if you don't compress elements of a story into something like

59:43.080 --> 59:48.680
universal imagery, then it's going to, no one's going to understand it. So think about,

59:48.680 --> 59:55.400
so think about like if someone watched, someone from the 15th century watched pulp fiction,

59:55.400 --> 59:59.800
like they would have no idea what they're watching. Like what am I watching? What are these things

59:59.800 --> 01:00:04.840
people have in their hands and what are these things that people are drawing, like putting up

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:10.040
their nose or like, what are they, what is this? Like this doesn't mean anything because it's so

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:15.880
idiosyncratic. In the Bible, what you have is you have stories that have been compressed and

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:23.320
condensed and are telling the events in a way that that's just what it is. And so the idea that

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:30.360
the first chapter of Genesis is like some is, could be seen as a scientific description is

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:34.360
absolute nonsense. Like it's complete nonsense. And so I'm sorry to all the creationists who

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.600
think that that's what's going on there. It's just not, it's just not. And but the problem is that

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.640
it doesn't have to be the idea that that's what's valuable. The idea that a scientific

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:48.680
description of an event is what is supremely valuable and everything should conform to that

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:54.680
standard is pure nonsense. And so the description of let's say the creation in the first chapter of

01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:03.400
Genesis is in my, I think is the most powerful and accurate description of the manner in which the

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:09.320
world exists. But it is not doing it in a way that like I said, it's not a biologist description.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:14.120
It's the description of a hierarchy of meaning, a hierarchy of participation, you know,

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:20.760
so the centrality of consciousness, the centrality of recognizing the good in the world, these things

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:26.760
have nothing to do with what they have very little to do with the way that that that a kind of

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.640
forensic description would be. So I think that all the stories in scripture have to be taken very

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:36.680
seriously. Now that you're taken seriously out of description of events, but we don't have to

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:41.080
figure out what the mechanical causes are behind some of the things that are there.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.680
So people are like reading. So like, I don't know, you read in the book of Joshua that the sun

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:50.520
stopped, you know, for 24 hours and people are like, well, how is that possible? Trying to

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:54.760
figure out like how the earth could move and what this could happen? How could I describe the

01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:00.600
mechanical causation of that? It's like, dude, stop it. What are you doing? Who cares? There's a

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:06.600
reason why things are described that way. The reason have to do with their meaning. And so you

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:11.640
don't have to understand what it is that if you had a video camera, you would be filming and you

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:17.480
could you could capture on a video camera. But it also doesn't mean that what it's saying is just

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:23.400
something someone made up. It's a description of something in a way that emphasizes its meaning.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:30.520
And it's, you know, it's it's so it's a it's a it's a kind of mythological language. But in the

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:37.320
Bible, at least it's it they they they're describing some kind of event, maybe from a distance, maybe

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:44.600
from, you know, several generations after maybe from that type of memory, but it but it is a memory

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.880
of something. Yeah, I analogy, and it's too bad we only have a little bit of time left because

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.880
I feel like this would be I'm like unpacking something that would be probably several hours of

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:59.000
conversation. So, you know, maybe we can come back another time or something. But but an example

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.240
to my is like last night, I've been writing my dreams down last night, I had a dream where I was

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:10.040
like, in this German war zone scenario, and I was like, on my hands and knees and crawling around

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:16.360
through puddles and hiding behind car tire things. And I had a gun, and I like lost the gun, and I

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:20.520
was trying to find the gun. And then I had to report back. It was all this stuff. And within

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:24.440
that, I think if I were to like retrace and be like, Okay, I need to understand this dream. So,

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.520
I'm going to go to Germany. I'm going to try to find this place. I'm going to try to like,

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:33.560
in account of this guy's like, no, no, like, no, it was like, there was a gun. There was truth

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:39.320
within the dream. It just wasn't exactly as you know, literal as like your waking consciousness

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:44.680
may want to define it as this kind of what I'm maybe perhaps gathering and that might be a little

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:50.040
bit of a stretch, but but even like your waking consciousness. Now, so think about how right

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:54.920
now, let's say around you, there, there's millions of things happening at the same time. There's like

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:59.960
billions and billions of things happening simultaneously around you. And so in order

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:09.240
for you to make sense of that, you have to draw phenomena into coherent through a coherent line.

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:13.480
So even if it's just your day, like you went through your day, you get home, like there are

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:17.560
millions of things that happen to you that day, like millions and millions and millions. And so

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:21.800
but then you tell the story of your day, what you're going to do is you're going to compress,

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.080
you're going to take the elements that are meaningful, and you're going to compress them

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:31.080
together in a manner in which you are going to show the line that connects these elements together.

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:39.320
Okay, so that's how we do it. Now, think of that now over a thousand years instead of over one day.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:47.560
Think of how I can do that in a manner in which I would have to tell the story of my day to someone

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:53.400
in a thousand years. And so there's a kind of compression that happens. And that compression

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:58.840
doesn't mean that it's like I said, it doesn't mean that you didn't have a day or that

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:03.800
but it means that there are so many examples that I could give you. But like, let's say

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:08.920
a simple example would be, let's say in that story of the German story,

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:13.560
your dream, you're trying to tell that to someone. You're trying to tell that to someone who lives,

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:20.920
who's a Maasai in Kenya, right, from 500 years ago. And so are you going to say you had a gun?

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.960
No, you're going to say I had a weapon, right? You're going to say something like I had a

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:31.640
weapon in my hands. But that Maasai, they only understand a weapon to be something like a lance.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:36.840
But they might have the same dream or a totally different dream with the same like undercurrent

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:42.760
of truth. They'll have a lance in their hand instead of a gun. Yeah. And so that's the type

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:50.760
of contraction that I'm saying. It's like if I say a sword, that has way more power than if I say

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:57.320
a Glock. Because a Glock is like a super reduced version. And even if I say a gun is better than

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:02.440
if I name like the brand of the thing. It's like this, it's this compression of elements

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:10.040
that is what ancient storytelling was doing and what you find in scripture. So some of them reach

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:17.880
levels that are so high, like a serpent, you know, like a tree, like a, like a garden. These

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:25.640
elements are now universal and so compressed. I'm going to ask about something just to generally

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:33.160
put it into the ether to reflect upon. I'm curious to your perception of things like the ancient

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:37.960
fertility cults, like the sacred mushroom and the cross book, the John Allegro book and

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.600
Ellucinian mysteries and, you know, all of like the mystery cults of Greece, etc. And the potential

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:52.280
of, you know, ergot or LSD being used to as like these like death, death and rebirth ceremonies.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:57.640
And a lot of what we gather from the Bible in fact has influenced from the psychedelic experience

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:04.040
and conflation of these different like ancient practices into what we now call, you know,

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:15.240
Bible and God and death and rebirth and. Well, let me say this. I think that it is 60 seconds.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:21.640
What do you think about that? No, but I what I do think is that it is exactly a

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:29.240
it is exactly an image of the reductionism at which we've arrived in terms of modern

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:35.720
scientism, which is that we want to find the substance. What's the chemical? Like what's the

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:41.880
chemical? What's the what's the binding thing? You know, what's the what's the what's the medicine?

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:49.080
And that's what we think is happening. So the whole psychedelic Ellucinian mysteries things

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:54.680
is hilarious. I find it just hilarious, which is that the Ellucinian ministries lasted what three

01:07:54.680 --> 01:08:03.080
days, four days of nonstop like rituals, all like that would take you through an entire process

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:08.200
that was extremely complex and that no one knows about because everybody has kept it a secret.

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:14.760
And then you get to the end of it. And then you have a final revelation. Now, whether or not that

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:23.480
revelation might have been supplemented by some chemical is possible. But the idea that that's

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:29.240
what it is is absolutely ridiculous. It's completely ridiculous. And even people who talk

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:35.560
about the psychedelics, it's like, how about if we talk about, let's at least talk about the vision

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:39.800
instead of talking about the stupid mushroom, like it's like they just people get obsessed with the

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:44.760
stupid mushroom, like let's at least talk about the vision and see the coherence of the vision

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:50.040
across the different traditions. Let's at least talk about that. But the idea that so for example,

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:57.880
like the only thing that's closest to the so called mystery cults right now in the world is

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:05.000
the Christian liturgy. That's the closest thing that you can have, because it is it is a a death

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.880
and rebirth ritual through baptism. It is a movement into a scandalous mystery, which is

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:14.680
the Eucharist, a revelation at the end of participation and eating the body of a God.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:21.000
Like that is that's what Christianity is. But the idea that if we could just have psychedelics,

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:27.320
well, no, no, no, no, that's, that's more just, that's more just like an interesting kind of thing

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.720
to hang to like a handle to grab one toes, like, oh, interesting. I think that there's like,

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:37.240
or deal poisoning, you know, like the form of like fasting, and, you know, there's, there's

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:41.480
like the sun dance, Native American sun dance thing, or you're fasting for several days, and

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.000
you're dancing around a tree, and then you're hung from the tree, and you're going through this like

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.080
death and rebirth, like losing of the body, you're finally coming to a point where

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:54.600
your body is so drained, you think you're on the edge of of transitioning out of the body,

01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:00.600
and suddenly there's this like, oh, okay, I'm rebirthed again, you know, I'm born again,

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:04.680
like that, I think that happens many in many different scenarios, like a right of passage

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:08.840
in culture is very common, but it's something that, you know, I don't know that there's a definitive

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:14.280
right of passage in Western culture, for the most part, but it doesn't need to be psychedelics per

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:20.600
say, just something. Well, we have something called baptism, which is, which is, which is that, and

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:26.360
it is, it is definitely a death and rebirth. There's also the, so the idea of reaching these

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:32.840
states through fasting is probably much better, because the problem with the psychedelics, and I

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:40.520
can see it, it's that at least my, my encounter with people that have just done psychedelics is that

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:46.440
I don't think they come back with, not sure they come back with much, like I'm not that impressed

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:52.440
with, with the things that I've heard people come back with. Some of it seems really confused,

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:58.600
like some of it seems, because it's like you rip the veil off, and then you enter into a world of,

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:05.800
of encounters with, let's say, transpersonal beings, but it's like they're all kinds of

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.920
transpersonal beings, like it's not as if everything that exists in the, in the invisible

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:18.360
is there to help you and is good, like that's not true. And so I, I feel like there's a lot of,

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:22.520
and so I'm not, I'm not totally discounting it, like I'm not saying that it's evil or whatever,

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:28.120
I'm just, I just am not super impressed, and like I, I'm not impressed at what psychedelics did

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:35.400
to, in the 60s, to our culture, and I am very wary about them coming back right now, because

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:41.880
we, we're in a worse place than we were in the 60s, like we are, we are in a more disjointed,

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:50.360
broken, narcissistic space than people were in the 60s. So imagining that coming back, I don't know,

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:56.280
man. I mean, it'd be tough. I mean, now it's becoming like more of like a passionate conversation,

01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:01.160
and now we're going to, we're going to close it, but I mean, it's tough to say that anything as

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:05.240
an absolute, like you could, like there's suggestions that Francis Crick, part of his

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:11.240
discovery of the triple helix model was a product of him using, I think it was LSD,

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:16.440
and taking this huge, you know, massive information that he's been aggregating,

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:20.360
and then through that psychedelic experience or, you know, whatever you work on, psychedelics,

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.920
another one of those words, kind of like Spirit of God, whatever, it's got a lot of,

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:27.320
a lot of flakes on it. Those seemingly like disparate connections that he was, he was in

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.400
these different tunnels, suddenly like fused for a moment, and then he comes out of that

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:35.640
experience because he's done so much work in his like, his other world.

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.880
Yeah, so you could understand it, you could understand that that's probably

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:45.800
what something that the Ellucian Mysteries were offering. They would create a massive ritual that

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:51.640
lasted several days, and then in the last moment, there would be some, they would use some supplement,

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:57.480
and that that would, so you can imagine like, there's a little residue, a little residue of that

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:03.000
in Christian communion, especially in the monastic sphere where someone would be fasting for,

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:08.520
would be fasting probably for a whole day, or at least maybe more before they would take communion,

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:13.640
and then there would be a little bit of that with, in terms of, obviously it's not psychedelic,

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:21.480
but a little bit of, let's say, a little help to kind of break down some things with taking

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:28.600
wine after having fasted for a few days. Yeah, and I think the confusion as well could

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:34.200
make sense, the sensation of like, oh, like what you're saying doesn't feel so cogent,

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:40.760
and perhaps within some of those, I don't know, like super conscious states, for lack of better

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:47.240
words, maybe a person kind of stumbles in territory that's not as effable as like what they would

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:50.680
read or, you know, or regurgitate out of a book, and it's kind of like- Yeah, well, they don't,

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:56.120
people rarely talk about the bad trip. People don't talk about the bad trip for some reason,

01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:01.080
because I mean, I have witnessed people, like I have witnessed people in my

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.760
surrounding kind of just go down that route, and I mean, I don't know if it's because they were

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:11.400
already psychologically fragile, but like I've watched them break apart, like I've watched them

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:21.240
go into a psychotic state as soon as really hard things started to present themselves to them.

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:29.320
So yeah, so I think that I do worry about this cold resurgence of psychedelics right now. I

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:34.920
definitely, I worry about it because I'm afraid people are going to see it as an easy way in.

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:39.880
It's like, well, just take this pill, you know, you want to know what spirituality is? Just take

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:49.640
this pill. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a lot to say there. At least for some people, it seems to be

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:56.760
that like- Certainly, you can, I think a person can develop a dependence on, you know, a clergy

01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:01.880
person can develop a dependence on the idea of God, you know, and then wearing that as a mask,

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:06.120
and putting on the robe and putting on the cross, and there's that, that exists, a spiritual person

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:10.440
can do that with the beads, you know, like there's a lot of different versions of that, and someone

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:14.440
could wear an ayahuasca route around their neck, and like that's their thing, and they go back and

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:20.040
they do their own psychedelic baptism every six months, but they don't actually resource themselves

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:30.280
in their waking life to be able to fulfill some of the lessons that they garnered during that

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:34.440
experience. So they just go back to their previous momentum, and that's when it becomes kind of

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:39.720
bullshitty, where it's like, no, no, like the window gets opened in various different ways.

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:43.960
You can have a near-death experience, you could fall in love, you could eat way too many mushrooms,

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:49.480
you know, or whatever, you know, wow, like the window is out, the veil has been thinned,

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:53.960
and now the window closes, now what do you do with it? And I think that's the difference between

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:58.920
someone that's like a Michael Pollan, for example, where people seem to like respect his perspective,

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:03.160
and like the rainbow gathering person that still doesn't have a job, and you know, still

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:07.720
isn't really like that effective in society, which effective, I don't really like, you know,

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:13.160
it's a dumb thing to say, but you know what I mean? So that's, there's nuance to everything,

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:18.040
including religion, including the psychedelic experience, including, you know, everything.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:23.080
Yeah, well, I've never done psychedelics, so I'm definitely not, I don't, I want to be careful

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:31.960
that I'm not, that I'm not being too harsh, but I do see, like, I don't know, I do see that it's,

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:36.600
the fact that it's so public, and everybody's talking about it so publicly, I think it worries

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:42.200
me, you know. For good reason. Even at the time of the, if there was part of something like the

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:47.400
Elusinian mysteries, and if it was part of some of the rituals that existed in the past, and it

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:52.440
would always have been like secret, it would always have been something that was kept, because

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:58.760
it's also very dangerous. So, and it doesn't get conflated into like an egoic badge of honor,

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:04.920
which then it's kind of tripping back into that previous momentum of, you know, egotism or whatever.

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:10.120
Now, suddenly, you're like, the ego is so strong, that you had so much momentum in that, now you're

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:15.640
taking this divine quotations, or maybe not in quotations experience, and you're actually

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:21.160
leveraging the divine to bolster the ego. And that's like, oh, like, all right, what do we do with

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:26.520
that? You know, and then, you know, that's a whole other conversation. Thanks, man. I hope.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:30.200
I'm gonna, yeah, I need to go now, but it was good to, it was good to meet you, took me in

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:36.600
surprising places. Good times. Is there a place that people ought to be directed to go from here,

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:40.840
if they want to go deeper into your stuff, your podcast and YouTube? And people can check out the

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:46.040
symbolicworld.com. That's my website. And that's where you'll find most of the, like, I have a

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:50.040
presence on YouTube, and there's a podcast version of what I'm doing. And there's a group, like a

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:55.240
kind of community of people around that are writing articles about this kind of symbolic thinking,

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:58.120
a symbolic vision of the world. So yeah, people can check that out.

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:02.600
Right. Thank you, man. At some point, we'd love to run it back and maybe start with the

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.480
start with the Bible stuff. Start with the Bible stuff.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:18.520
All right. That is it. That is all. Thank you all for tuning in. And I'll see you all soon.
