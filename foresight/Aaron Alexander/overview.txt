1. **Psychedelics and Spirituality**: The discussion revolved around the nuances of psychedelic experiences and their integration into daily life. There's a concern that some individuals might become dependent on these experiences as a mask for their spirituality, rather than using them as a transformative tool.

2. **Integration of Experiences**: It's emphasized that the real work begins after a psychedelic experience; integrating the lessons into one's waking life is crucial. The conversation points out that merely repeating experiences like psychedelic rituals without applying their insights in practical ways can be considered "bullshitty."
