1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,160
I want to start with a quote to get things moving from from Mr. Voltaire, and I'm curious

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,160
your perception of it. I feel like you'll probably have some thoughts.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,480
A quote that I find interesting is, if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,240
him. So I think it's interesting that Voltaire chooses him. I think that's worth discussing

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,680
as well, and also the necessity to invent said God. If it, she, him did not exist in

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,000
some absolute manner. What do you think about all that?

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,800
I mean, I understand the impetus behind the quote in the sense that one of the things

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,400
I think we're seeing more easily right now is we had a moment where we, some people,

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,600
at least some people thought that we could just be rational and scientific and we could

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,120
just get rid of all these superstitions, then we would, we'd be good, we'd be fine.

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,120
And what we're noticing is that that's not what's happening. People are becoming nihilistic,

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,040
you know, they're moving into despair. We're noticing we don't have much to hold us together

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,640
in terms of societies. We don't have things that bind us anymore as we get rid of, as

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,200
we get rid of religion, as we get rid of God. And so I think that that's probably what Voltaire

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,080
was perceiving was the notion that we need something above us, something transcendent

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,360
to unify us, or else we tend to fragment and to scatter. So I think that the intuition

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,240
behind, behind Voltaire is right. And you see a lot of people that say today, taking

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,560
that very cynically in the sense that they realize we need something to bind us together

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,560
so it could be anything, we could just put something up there. And we just need, we need

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,160
it, or else we need to celebrate something together, or else why are we something, why

21
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,400
are we a country, why are we a nation, why are we a family, why are we a group rather

22
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,400
than just a bunch of individuals slamming against each other.

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,040
I reflect on that quite regularly, internally at a deeper level, I have a sensation of like,

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:09,080
I can have a sensation of like, aimlessness. And a part of that I have these various, like

25
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,400
what I would concede to be like illusions of perceived progress. And that's something

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,360
that I, I ask a lot of, I feel like most people can kind of collectively agree of like, yeah,

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,880
like progress, like, well, let's, let's do progress. And then that presents the question

28
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,960
of like, okay, perfect, I love, love that love the morale, but like progress towards

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,680
what? Like what is our ultimate end goal here? What are we progressing toward?

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,960
No, I totally agree that that's definitely a problem, especially in terms of modern kind

31
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,960
of atheist progressive narrative, which is that, what are we aiming at? Because in order

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,880
to progress, you need an aim, you need to be moving in a direction or else you're just

33
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,440
aimlessly wandering. And so the question is, what is it that's happening? It's easier.

34
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,800
I think one of the mistakes that we've seen in the, in with the enlightenment and, and

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,680
it's, and what came after is we had this idea that if we progress in terms of technical

36
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,320
knowledge, that is, if we accumulate technical knowledge, then that's similar to the manner

37
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,680
in which we're going to progress morally as a nation, as nations, as people, but those

38
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,440
are not, they're not the same. The accumulation of technical knowledge is not the same as

39
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,960
morality or, or understanding what it is that makes a life worth living. These are not the

40
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,560
same thing. And I don't think that we have progressed in that at all. I think on the

41
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:36,560
contrary, I think that we have traded one for the other. We've traded a kind of comfort,

42
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,320
technical comfort and material comfort. We've traded that for purpose and we've traded that

43
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,720
for virtue and for a sense that we are moving towards something valuable. And because of

44
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,000
it, people are, people are lost. Well, not everybody, but there's definitely a sense

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,720
around us. When I look at young people, especially, you know, the despair is palpable.

46
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,360
Yeah. Yeah. And so you, so you asked before, we press record, like, why, like, why the heck

47
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:13,680
do you have me here? I'm like a theologian icon, iconographer, philosopher, like, what does

48
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,160
this have to do with like, this is supposed to be like a health thing or something? One,

49
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,440
there's like, I had John Revekey on recently, and I know that you guys are close. And one

50
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,600
of the things that came up with that was like the, the meaning crisis, like we're going

51
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,480
to be like a, like a meaning crisis of, is there some kind of ground to stand on? Are

52
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,680
we just on this kind of slippery, illusory, hollow sensation of progress towards some

53
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,040
technological financial gain, like towards what? And I think it's interesting that within

54
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,040
like disease or dis-ease, you know, probably a hundred percent of diseases or there's

55
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,160
some root of stress involved in that somewhere in the system. And we can address that

56
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,120
topically or allopathically and say, aha, here, here is the tumor, but then you can wind it

57
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,360
back. And, you know, at some point, there's, there's something to cause friction in the

58
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,680
system to eventually manifest as some type of, you know, physical expression of disease. And

59
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,680
so when the majority of people that are visiting a hospital are there for something that's

60
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,800
stress related or something that's like psychosomatic, mental, emotional, you know,

61
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,520
lifestyle related or something that would just pass on its own, but we're seeking out for this

62
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,680
pill or solution, at the root there, I feel like we can start to address some of our medical

63
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,840
experiences through like these, this internal lens, you know, and through starting to establish,

64
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,040
you know, maybe starting to address that, like that, that, that meaning crisis that, that I

65
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,920
personally experience, you know, I feel like many other people resonate with that. So what do you,

66
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,920
what do you think about that? Like that, that, that internal experience, eventually expressing

67
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:05,240
out into, you know, a physical manifestation and some path maybe towards like finding relationship

68
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,000
or balance or homeostasis between the two, the internal and the external, I guess, is maybe

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,160
like why I was, I wanted to have this conversation with you. Yeah. I think you're right. I think

70
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,760
that you definitely, the idea that there is a relationship between, let's say our own inner

71
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:27,480
direction and our exterior manifestations in the body is definitely something which happens.

72
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:34,600
I think the mistake that we make, especially us today, is that we, we look for, we think that

73
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,240
we're going to find that in some kind of like comfort, like we think we're going to find that in

74
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,720
some kind of, you know, if I could just be relaxed enough, if I could just rest enough, if I could

75
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,200
just, you know, let's say, serve myself enough, like if I could take care of my needs, you know,

76
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,800
I need to, I need some me time, like that's the, that's the, the, the modern way of looking at it,

77
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,680
that actually accentuates the problem. And it, I think that the, the more ancient solution would

78
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,960
have been something like give yourself. If you give yourself, then a lot of those other things,

79
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,600
they tend to diminish. Not that you won't be sick, maybe you will, but it won't matter so much,

80
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,640
because you'll be living, you'll be living a purposeful life and you'll be living towards,

81
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,200
towards, because what do you do, what do you want? You just want to live until you're 99 years old and

82
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,080
be miserable, you know, and internally and be physically, you could be physically fit and

83
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,760
kind of looking to be relaxed and to, to live as long as possible. Or it seems like the,

84
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,480
the more ancient vision is something like give yourself. If you give yourself, then you actually

85
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,880
might have a very short life. You might have a very short and painful life, but that short and

86
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,800
painful life will be bright. It'll be shining. And look at the people that we admire. Like we,

87
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,160
we, we don't admire, we admire people that have done that, right? Those are the people that shine

88
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,240
to us. Like, like stars, people who, who give themselves for a cause, who give themselves to

89
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,560
others, you know, they become something else. And so the image that we have, for example,

90
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,320
Christianity is actually the opposite of it's, it really is the image of someone who's willing

91
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:19,160
to die for his friends, who's willing to die for others. That is actually what brings the real

92
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,760
balance. But I, but I do feel like right now we have a kind of weird twisted version of that,

93
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,280
which is trying to heal my own, all my own issues, like heal my stuff. And then,

94
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,360
then I'll find homeostasis. But yeah, there's a book I've mentioned here a bunch of times called

95
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,120
whatever you think, think the opposite by Paul Arden. I think that's comes up in what you're

96
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:48,760
saying now. I think it is like, you would, I would think that by focusing on the individual,

97
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:55,400
the individual will start to get, you know, become more and more robust and, and like well

98
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:02,200
developed and complex and content, you know, and all of those things. But in fact, it takes

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,040
like relinquishing the attachment to the self in order to come back around and heal the self

100
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,160
and like grow the self. So it's like in the forgetting of the self, the self is actually

101
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,840
has the spaciousness to, to grow and heal and do all the things. Whereas when there's excessive

102
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,120
focus on the self and losing that connection outward, then it's like, I feel like the self

103
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,200
like suffocates on itself. Yeah, but there is like, there is a possibility of practicing,

104
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,280
of practicing doing certain practices, you know, on yourself, with yourself, like meditation prayer,

105
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,240
some kind of a schesis, you know, when you, and I think people who also do physical activity

106
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,880
have a different version of that, which is that you feel your limit, you know, you feel your limit

107
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,680
constantly, and you're trying to push further than your limit. Those are, those are practices that

108
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:59,160
can actually help you understand how it works. Like it's not about, it's not, it's not comfort

109
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,200
doesn't give meaning at all. Like, you know, feeling good about yourself is not, is not the

110
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,000
way to go. People are going to hate hearing that. But actually trying to, anything that makes you

111
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,520
transcend yourself is going to start with pain. It's going to start with a sense of disease,

112
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:23,080
exactly a disease in general. Like I am, I'm not where I should be. I need, I need, I need to, to,

113
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,320
to kind of move in the right direction. Of course, we can beat ourselves up too. And that's not

114
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,240
helpful. Usually beating ourselves up for not being where we want to be is another kind of

115
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,920
weird self centered thing. Like it's a weird kind of a kind of moving it back, moving into

116
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,720
experience and just feeling sorry for yourself or feeling guilty all the time. That's probably not,

117
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,800
that's not the right way to go about it either. But you do need to feel some pain in order to

118
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,760
move towards meaning. Yeah, they're so back to Viveki, something that I learned from him as the,

119
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:57,640
the origin of the word religion is religio or something of the sort. And it means to bind

120
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:04,280
or to bring together, like to unite, which is also the origin of the word yoga, yoke union

121
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:10,680
connection. I mean, it's like it like spans across so many different ideologies, this idea of like

122
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:19,720
connection. Yeah. And so I feel like the word religion, the word God, the word spirit, spirituality,

123
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:27,400
all of those have so many meanings and kind of like these crusty old barnacles attached to them.

124
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,800
Yeah. And so that like at the, at the, at the root of most of those words is like, oh, it's pretty

125
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:42,040
good. It's valuable. But then the outside, there's just a lot of flaky. Yeah, a lot of flakes attached

126
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,520
to it. I totally agree. And now, and now it's, now there's a confusion for the flake for the actual,

127
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,360
like the root. No, you're right. And it's, and it's actually the fault, a lot of it is the fault

128
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,560
of the religious people, where they started, I think there was a lot of forgetting, like just a

129
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,360
forgetting of what all this stuff is about. And it becoming more and more arbitrary in the modern

130
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,800
world. As people became materialists, it's as if a lot of this stuff became arbitrary. So it was

131
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:16,040
like, you're a Christian, so you believe that some guy died on a cross, and now you're going to go to

132
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,160
heaven. If you believe that, that's, that's what, that's what a Christian is, really? Like, that's

133
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:27,720
it? That's pathetic. That's really lame, if that's what it is. But it was really, it's really cute.

134
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,840
It's like childish, right? It's like, like really beautiful, actually. It's like, wow, like you are

135
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:39,000
a 50 year old woman or man. And this is like a Disney, which, you know, I think there's a lot of

136
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,360
meaning in, in fictional novels and tales and all that stuff. And they're, they're relating back to

137
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,600
that core root truth, typically. But it's, I mean, I think it's not, not having like a pessimistic

138
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,560
feeling of like, oh my God, I can't believe it. It's also kind of like, wow, that's amazing. Like,

139
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,280
I find that beautiful. Well, I mean, I think that for a lot of people, having that maybe that simple

140
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:08,840
faith could probably be totally fine. But it also, there also needs to be, there needs to be an

141
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,120
intellectual version of that. And it has always existed. It was always there. If you read the

142
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,720
early church fathers, you read the mystics, like it's all there. It's just that a lot of it has

143
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,280
been forgotten. And it's interesting, because right now there's an interesting moment, like people

144
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:28,440
like John Revecki are part of that, where because of the space, because of the space where cognitive

145
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,600
science is now introducing itself into the discourse, and we realize that we can't escape

146
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,520
perception, like we can't escape this experience of the world, and that we can't pretend like it's

147
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,160
not there and just talk about science as if it's outside of that. So coming back to this experience

148
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:51,240
and this experience of quality of this experience of, you know, of patterns and of embodiment,

149
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,600
then we can start to realize what religion is. Again, we can start to understand it, that we can

150
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,600
we can see that the world presents itself as so multifaceted, that unless we have things which

151
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:09,560
bind phenomena together, then everything scatters, especially at the human level. If we don't have

152
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:16,440
ritualization, we don't have story, we don't have orders, which bind even yourself, like your

153
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:23,480
own personal self, and your family, and then you scale that up, you know, cosmically, then the

154
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,320
world doesn't exist. And then you realize, oh, well, that's what religion is. It's the it's the

155
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,040
man in which things bind together that ends up looking like ritual, it ends up looking like

156
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,880
story, it ends up looking like all the things what people think are silly and superstitious.

157
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,480
But actually without them, reality scatters, and you can you can apply to your life, you realize

158
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,800
actually that most of the things you do are ritualized, and there's nothing superstitious

159
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,600
about them, like brushing your teeth is a ritualized act towards a purpose. But you have

160
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:59,160
ritualized acts towards purposes that are higher than just getting your teeth clean, that are about

161
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,440
how can we bind together as a group, how can we recognize what it is that we have in common?

162
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And then it looks like processions, it looks like circumambulation, it looks like

163
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,080
singing together, it looks like all these things which which the modern person found silly,

164
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,120
they kind of flow back in. I feel like there can be like, I mean, like you're saying like you can't

165
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,920
escape religion, you can't escape dogma, we didn't say you can't, you can't even say exactly, but

166
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:34,040
I imagine you probably align with that to some degree, or maybe not. But so today, you can see

167
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,960
Christianity seems at least in my bubble of a world that I exist in, seems to be waning

168
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,240
popularity of it. You know, there's a lot more like spirituality in quotations. There's like,

169
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,320
we're certainly worshiping, you know, we worship our cell phones, we worship our

170
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:57,160
notifications, we worship our financial status, we worship our socio economic status where we're

171
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,440
at on the ladder, you know, so we're like, we're worshiping a lot, a lot, maybe more than ever,

172
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:10,760
really. As far as like compulsive worship, we might be at the highest, you know, not that it's a

173
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:16,680
competition, but we may be at like the highest state of worship ever, at least from the lens of

174
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,720
like compulsive worship. Yeah, but there's also, there's also prescribed, there's also like prescribed

175
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,000
worship, which is actually pretty strong right now, people don't really realize it, but you know,

176
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:34,200
it's just because people have separated the notion of religion from other ritualized aspects of

177
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,400
their life. But if, for example, you realize, you could say that recycling is a form of worship,

178
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:46,680
you know, because you are ritually acting in a way which is prescribed to you from above,

179
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:53,000
in order to participate in a story and a purpose together. And so we all, you know,

180
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,280
on one day, this day a week, we all put out our separated materials or whatever. And so

181
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,400
there is a ritualized procession about that, which is similar to a religious procession,

182
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,320
it's just that it's ordered towards something else. And you can say what's different because

183
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,800
that's really valuable, like saving the environment is really valuable. And I would say, yeah,

184
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:18,280
you're right, saving the environment is really valuable. But us binding together, let's say,

185
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:25,160
under the transcendent source of love is probably pretty valuable too, right? It probably has a

186
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:33,000
value that is powerful as well. So I think we can re-understand a lot of the practices of our

187
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,880
ancestors, even if we're able to notice, like you said, that we worship. And the problem is exactly

188
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,680
what you said is that addiction is a form of worship, especially addiction. It's one of the

189
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,520
most easy. If you want to understand worship, like addiction is one of the best ways because

190
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:55,400
it's a ritualized cycle of attention, you know, and you get possessed by it. And it actually ends up,

191
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:02,360
let's say, reorganizing your life around its attention, right, around its existence. And so

192
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:09,960
it actually uses you as a body in order to make sure that you are sacrificing and propitiating to

193
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,440
this God. But you can see how it's like a demon, right? It's like a parasitic God, you could say.

194
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:22,760
It's a God that actually ultimately wants to destroy you. But it can help you understand

195
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,560
what worship is, which is that when we would do that, like if a person would go through the beads

196
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:35,080
of their prayer rope or whatever, that's similar in terms of this binded attention,

197
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:41,400
which is ritualized in order to get you somewhere. Yeah, there's a quote from Alan Watts. I mean,

198
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,000
I think it's from Alan Watts. I've heard it from Alan Watts. They said that we're confusing the

199
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,960
menus for the meal. And so we're eating, you know, the words duck confit, you know, like chewing on

200
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,600
the paper duck confit. But there's no like fat, you know, an omega threes and like there's just

201
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:08,760
not there's no calories there. Yeah. And so that's the reason that that that quote's coming to mind

202
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,720
is like, I wonder if there is some hierarchy of worship. I think often as we can romanticize

203
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,600
the ancients, you know, and romanticize hunter gatherers and like everything we're doing now is

204
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:26,600
wrong. Yeah, everything that happened yesterday was the way. It's like, what is like, is there like

205
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,640
some ultimate absolute better, you know, or is there like, how do we parse apart like where is

206
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,120
the menu? Where is the meal? Does it matter in the first place? Are we all just going to end up in

207
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,320
the same place anyway? Yeah, well, I think there is. I think there's an objective, I think there's

208
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,760
an objective hierarchy of worship for sure. And you can actually see it kind of playing itself out

209
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,920
in the story of religion or the man in which religion developed through the centuries. And it

210
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,040
does have to do with understanding where the good lies, you could say, what is it, the good that

211
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:06,360
binds us? What is it? You know, and I would say that it moves towards something like love, towards

212
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,960
something like compassion, self giving or self sacrifice. And I think that you can find that,

213
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,640
you know, of course in Christianity, but I think you see some of that in Buddhism, although it's

214
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:22,120
not personalized so much in Buddhism. But you do find this idea that the highest, let's say the

215
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,960
highest value, the thing that should bind us together is actually paradoxically a giving away,

216
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:35,080
like it's a self emptying. And this self emptying becomes the thing which makes it possible for

217
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:43,000
us to exist as more than just these selfish little beings. And so I think that that is a

218
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,800
true hierarchy of being. And so you can imagine local gods, for example, in the time of hunter

219
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,680
gatherers that had some function and some power over the group and would bind them together,

220
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,800
would give them a totem, would give them some type of identity and characteristics that they could,

221
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:04,200
that they could celebrate and participate in. But ultimately, that leads to constant war,

222
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,560
like it just leads to nonstop war. Because you're, you're, these gods are fighting in the heavens,

223
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,560
right? These different gods, these different totems and gods are fighting amongst each other.

224
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,960
As the tribes fight and are constantly at war, we always forget that the Greeks,

225
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,200
even though they saw themselves as being one people, they were always fighting nonstop. Every

226
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,720
year, people would go to war. So the idea of binding towards higher goods, I think is something

227
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:36,920
which happened for a reason. As far as like making this conversation actionable towards some,

228
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:43,080
you know, directionality in one's life, something that I think I could use more of,

229
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,320
and me being like a product of the culture that I've been, you know, grown in.

230
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,760
I've heard you mentioned before, and then it caused me to look it up that the

231
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,560
Plato's transcendentals, the three transcendentals is beauty, goodness and truth is what I've

232
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:06,760
read on the internet. And that I think is something that is, is kind of can easily be

233
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:12,520
forgotten in the modern era, to pick on the modern era. You know, and that's like I just

234
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,000
got back from Greece, thankfully, it was really like an exceptional experience. And we went to

235
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,040
various different islands there and, you know, learned about the God of Sculpeyus, the God of

236
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:27,480
medicine and the way that they approached medicine. And the way that they approached medicine, one

237
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:34,120
theaters were, were built beside or very close to hospitals, which I thought was very interesting.

238
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,960
So that concept of theater was like an entrenched within medicine. And when you enter into the

239
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,320
hospital, it was, it was really beautiful. And there was, there was art, and you'd get into,

240
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,640
you know, a body of water and you, you know, cold plunge and hot tub. And, you know, there was,

241
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:57,480
it was, and what that, the way that the tour guides described to me was through art that,

242
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:04,840
like that, that the emotive power of art and also senses, you know, so like Tantra in a way,

243
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,360
you could say maybe that kind of softens up and opens up some space within, like the tour guide

244
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,440
said, like the soul, you know, so whatever, whatever word you want to put that deeper part.

245
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:22,840
And I feel like in the modern era, there's a bit of a jump to just what is the physical

246
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,520
expression. Now let's like attack that physical expression, as opposed to allowing spaciousness

247
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,840
and using some of these softer tactics to kind of go through and, and, and open up some space to be

248
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:41,880
able to get into like what night, what lies beneath that outer physical expression. So that's

249
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,800
something I think that was very wordy. But essentially, the question or curiosity is, is

250
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,440
from your perception, what do you see that the value in Plato's three transcendentals,

251
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:01,320
beauty, goodness and truth in supporting us as modern people, at least from like a medical

252
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:07,000
perspective? I think you're definitely onto something and you, you understand, it's a good

253
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,160
way to understand the moment in which we are now, that is, right now, we, we have the, we have exactly

254
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,800
this idea that if we're treating the, the body, like if someone's sick, we're just going to treat

255
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:25,640
the body. So we bring someone to horrendous place, like our horrendous place of fluorescent lights,

256
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:32,920
you know, and, and green plastic things and, you know, and metal bars that metal beds that

257
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:41,640
look like prison bars. And that's where we bring people to heal because crazy. We think that it's

258
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,360
like, well, it's just, it's just like, it's just a car, right? We're just fixing a car.

259
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,240
So we're going to, we're going to bring someone, we're going to, we're going to put them in

260
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,920
the rooms with several people, and we're going to, we're going to embarrass them, have them,

261
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:58,200
you know, wear these horrible nightgowns or whatever. Like everything about it is this

262
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:06,360
reduction of the human person to, to a machine. And that's exactly the problem. That's exactly

263
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,000
the problem that, that we mentioned a little earlier, which is that with the return of something

264
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:18,040
like cognitive science, we're realizing that no, you can't pretend like there is no experience of

265
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:24,200
the world and that that experience of the world doesn't participate in, in your, in, in, in,

266
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,160
in the medical, in your healing. Like the, for example, the placebo effect is a great example,

267
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:35,160
right? So we believe every medical doctor believes that there's a placebo effect to medicine,

268
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:42,520
but they try to reduce that effect as much as possible because they want to reduce you to a

269
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:49,080
machine. And if you could prove that augmenting the placebo effect could actually help you heal

270
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:56,600
faster, they don't care because they don't like that idea. They don't like the idea that, that

271
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,440
mind, that experience participates in, in your, in your experience. And so when they look at

272
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,640
ancient medicine and they see the ritualization, they see the drama, like you said, in, in relationship

273
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,560
to the medical practice, they think it's all hocus pocus nonsense, but they still believe that

274
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,920
there's, that there's a placebo effect. It's hilarious. It's like, why wouldn't you, why

275
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:26,600
couldn't you use the best of medicine and then create a ritualized drama of practice in which

276
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:33,560
you would enter into the medical relationship as, you know, as a, like you said, like as a, as a

277
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:39,400
being and counting beauty, it's not possible. Like our world is too gone, at least for now,

278
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:44,760
it's too gone for that. So we're stuck with these horrible cement parking garages that are called

279
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,680
hospitals. Yeah, I wonder anytime someone uses the, the term they, I always, my mind always

280
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:56,680
jumps to like, who is they? And then also want is another curiosity. Like I don't know that

281
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:02,920
I'd love for you to define they in, in relation to that statement. And then also drawing back on,

282
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:11,960
on want. So they want to reduce us to a machine. It feels to me kind of just like it is reducing

283
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:19,480
itself to a machine. So what is the it now in this way? It would be the zeitgeist,

284
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,320
like the totality of culture moving together. And then we have these individual nodes that

285
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,400
pop up and they're wearing, you know, a lab coat and their names, Dr. Sanders or whatever.

286
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,760
All right, so let's, let's, let's frame it this way. So the movement, the same movement which

287
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:41,640
moved against religio and described religio as being hocus pocus magic and, and superstition

288
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:49,880
and ridiculous things people did or things people did that were imposed by power and, and, and

289
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,640
and patriarchy or whatever, however you want to describe it, this, the same, let's say narrative,

290
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,520
you could call it like the worst of the enlightenment narrative, the worst of the, of the

291
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:07,640
materialist scientific narrative that narrative leads at the same time to parking garage hospitals.

292
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,200
You know, because, because there's a coherence in the reduction of everything to its material

293
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,440
causes that brings about, you know, the, the, the, the medical establishment that we're,

294
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,840
that we're dealing with. And so it's, of course, it's a side effect. Like I don't think that

295
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,880
Locke and Hobbs thought that we would get to where we are. I don't think that they would,

296
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:36,760
that they, that they could have predicted that their ideas about, about rationality and Occam's

297
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,400
razor and, you know, there's these scientific revolutions that we went through would lead us

298
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:50,600
to a kind of dehumanized machine body. But that is what happened in the, in those causes.

299
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,320
But like I said, I do think so it's, you're right, when I say they, I don't mean, I can't, I can't,

300
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,160
it's not the doctors, it's not their fault. It's not, it's not the, it's not even the medical

301
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:08,920
establishment's fault at this point. But it is a movement, like it is a, it is a line that you

302
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,400
can draw from certain changes which happened in history, which brought us to this point.

303
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:23,000
But at the same time, I do think that seeing that now, there are possibilities of, of alternatives.

304
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,240
It's harder in the medical world, but there are other places where you can, where you can,

305
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,120
where someone can do that. For example, the same thing with schools, like schools are basically,

306
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,760
you know, they're factories for children, like they're, they're just factories pumping out children

307
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:44,280
into the world. Now that, there's a place where you can, where someone can find better alternatives,

308
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:50,840
you know, homeschool, private schools, whatever, schools that are more integrative and integrate

309
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:57,160
storytelling and culture and ritual and practice into, into a child's life rather than just have

310
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:04,440
them go through the system. But medical stuff is harder because it's so, so big and there's such a,

311
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:11,720
yeah. And there's also cranks, like that, a real cranks that exist in that, in that world of healing

312
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:18,040
too. It feels to me when I say like the they and like, you know, the it and all that as opposed to,

313
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,280
to personalizing an individual, having any type of intention, which that's a question

314
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:28,360
I have as, as well as like how much sovereignty do we have in our choices? And how much are we just

315
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,680
a part of this collective consciousness? And we're just, you know, a barrel of water just sloshing

316
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:39,560
about, you know, within that, if we are just this sloshing, sloshing barrel of water really works as

317
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,120
an analogy, but I'll try to force it. No, but I said what you mean, like we're just in the current,

318
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:51,000
like we're just going down stream. And there's not much we can do, we can notice that this isn't

319
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:57,080
pleasant, but it's not easy to understand how to go, how to go upstream. Like it's just not that

320
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:06,040
simple. Yeah. And so it feels to me like perhaps since the, at one point there was more, you know,

321
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:12,840
nature worship and animism and, and, you know, probably more like matriarchal societies were

322
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:19,000
more common and things of the sort. And then there was a shift. So the, the metaphoric

323
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:27,640
water sloshing about going to one side. And then I feel like, you know, I'll say like maybe Cartesian

324
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,920
times or Newtonian times and kind of entering into like, aha, no, like scientism. This is the

325
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:38,040
solution, you know, and pragmatism and everything needs to be rationalized. And I need to be able

326
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:45,240
to hold it and measure it. And that is truth. I don't know that culture as a whole is like, aha,

327
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,280
like, yes, I think it's, it feels to me kind of, it's just like a pendulum swinging. And right now

328
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,000
we're kind of, I don't know where we're at. If it is a pendulum swinging, I don't know where on the

329
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:03,880
swing we are, but we're certainly in some pragmatic reductionist rational swing phase. And it feels

330
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:10,520
like there's a yearning to kind of find some center or maybe wildly swing back to the other side.

331
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,560
Yeah. Well, there's, you could, I think you could see the extremes at the same time. So I think

332
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,120
that's probably the best way to understand, especially the modern, like the modern world

333
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,920
is to understand it as extremes manifesting themselves. There is a bit of a pendulum, but

334
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:32,200
you can also see it happening at the same time. So if you look at the, in the rationalism right

335
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,760
after the rational, like the hyper-rationalist phase was romanticism and symbolism and the

336
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:44,200
kind of degenerate symbolic thinking that we saw, you know, in the 18th, 19th century,

337
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,440
which was about fantastical imagination, all that stuff, you know, and the occultism that came

338
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,880
with that type of thinking as well. So if you look at the modern world is both the rationalism,

339
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,880
hyper-rationalism and all that stuff, but it's also like weird occultism and, you know,

340
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:08,360
Crowley and the return of witchcraft and Lovatsky and Theosophy and all that kind of,

341
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:14,360
that other side of modernity, which happens at the same time. So right now we could see that

342
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,720
the internet is a great example. The internet is a mix of hyper-rationality and control and,

343
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:26,280
you know, like furry avatars in the metaverse, which is like complete explosion of rationality

344
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:35,160
into idiosyncrasy in ways that you could never, ever imagine in the past. Like you can be anything

345
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:41,240
that you can possibly imagine in the metaverse, but that's also, that's happening at the same

346
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:47,160
time as this hyper-rational kind of strange control. And so I think that's probably the best

347
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:51,480
way because it's hard to, it would be hard to understand our moment if we didn't see those

348
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,960
two things happening at the same time. And I'd like to at some point probably try to draw back

349
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,160
to some kind of like ashmole, what can we do type scenario. But something that I was listening to

350
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:07,000
your podcast with Makayla Peterson in preparation to this one. And one of the things that I heard

351
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
her saying throughout that seemed like she was kind of like at least acknowledging with herself

352
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,200
historically speaking, and seems like a little bit present as well, leaning towards like rationality

353
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,560
and logic and pragmatism as like a safe haven. And I think that that's very common. Like I can,

354
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,320
I can notice that with myself. And I think many, many people we can oftentimes not projecting

355
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,040
any of this on hers or something I noticed now, like just back to speaking about me. I think I

356
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:44,600
can lean on pragmatism as a way because I feel like there's almost like a fear of chaos.

357
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,640
And that deeper underpart, you know, like there's a quote that I

358
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,840
from Marianne Williamson, who I've also had on here. So our deepest fear is not

359
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,200
that we are inadequate, our deepest fears that we are powerful beyond measure.

360
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,040
And I feel like that, that undercurrent, that underpart that sometimes I think in this,

361
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:10,520
in this modern era, that's kind of, it can be like masked by rationale and science and logic

362
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,240
and imperial research. And it's not a thing until it's been studied and all the peers have reviewed

363
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,080
it. And then we can start to like actually have a conversation. But there's also this welling,

364
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:29,480
this well beneath that it's like, oh, like, perhaps access to, you know, all the power and

365
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,240
answers to, you know, every, everything you could possibly imagine. But I feel like there's a little

366
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:41,080
bit almost like of a, for me, I can notice like, like almost like a fear or resistance around that

367
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:47,160
part. And so I'll just lean on science and lean on rationality and lean on, you know, because I

368
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:53,720
don't want to kind of touch the chaos of what's inside. Yeah, but I also think that it's important,

369
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,360
this is something that is difficult because unions are popular right now, I guess, in part because

370
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:04,360
of Jordan Peterson. But there's a tendency to confuse two things, like there's, there's a

371
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:11,080
trans rational space. And there's a pre rational space or, you know, there's something like this

372
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,560
subconscious, you could say, there's something like super consciousness and those,

373
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:22,120
they can look the same to people that are just trapped in consciousness. But if you read any

374
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:28,680
traditional text from any religion, they clearly demarcate those as not being the same. And so

375
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:36,920
the kind of chaos, the dream kind of chaos that that kind of emotional, romantic feeling that you

376
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:45,800
get is not the same as the sense that things culminate into a unity, which is beyond the

377
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:52,280
particulars, right, that there's this drive up towards something which is pulling me beyond

378
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:58,440
the world. Now, I understand why it can seem like sometimes it's the same in your experience, but

379
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:05,160
there's a, you could understand the rationality or the rational world is, is this like buffered

380
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:11,000
space that exists between those two poles, something which is pulling you up towards,

381
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:18,360
you could say the way to understand it would be that as an individual, for example, right,

382
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:25,080
if you give yourself to a higher cause, right, that higher cause is not in the individual,

383
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:31,880
it's not, it's not there. So if you take the world of the individual and you analyze it every

384
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,000
single aspect of it, you're never going to get the highest cause to which you're willing to sacrifice

385
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,480
yourself for. Does that make sense? And so now think of that for everything, like there's a world

386
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,480
of structured causality, but that world of structured causality gives itself up towards

387
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:56,200
higher participations, you could say. And then there's also a way in which it dissolves into

388
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,720
nothingness. So you as an individual, let's say the manner in which you could dissolve into all

389
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,920
kinds of idiosyncratic bad habits or passions or the way you could become obsessed with things and

390
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,480
kind of devolve into something which is not rational at all, right? It's like there's nothing,

391
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,720
if you, once, if you analyze you becoming addicted to things, you realize this is not

392
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:23,400
rational. Like this is, this is, this is breaking me apart. It's fragmenting me completely. But

393
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,440
that is different from this giving up, you could say, the way in which you participate. I don't

394
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,560
know if that makes sense. It's important, I think, because people are right now are so confused. They

395
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,800
think that spirituality is, sometimes they think that spirituality is this lower stuff

396
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:44,280
down here. Like it's about feeling and about, you know, how I, you know, how I, how I feel about

397
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,400
myself or how I feel about others or these like, these kind of vague intuitions that you get about,

398
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:57,320
about, about things. But the world, the higher world or the world of spiritual participation is

399
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:05,000
in some ways it, it's trans-rational. But once you grasp it, it's super clear. Like it's,

400
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,920
right? It's like the clearest thing you'll ever see. It appears as a, as a beacon of, of light

401
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,600
that's kind of guiding you beyond your limited world. Yeah. The, the only issue I have with

402
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,840
the idea of like higher and, and lower and placing a hierarchy on states of consciousness and like

403
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:30,920
aspects of, I don't know, existence life is, I think there can be a fragmentation or divorcing

404
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,960
or separation within self through that separation and the idea that something is higher than something

405
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:42,840
else. I understand why you say that, but it's also because this is the issue, the problem of

406
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,080
like equalizing everything is that hierarchies don't compete with their levels. That is that

407
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:55,480
if you are a healthy individual and all your thoughts and your passions are joined together,

408
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:03,880
then you will actually become the best part of a higher participation. So you will actually be a

409
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:11,000
better member of your family if you are united in that, in the, in the individual part. And so

410
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
it doesn't compete. That's what cults do. Cults, you want to know the difference between a real

411
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,760
religion and a cult? A cult will try to compete with lower levels of participation. Like a cult

412
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:28,360
will say you have to deny your family. You have to deny all these lower participation. And so it's

413
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:33,800
the same with like a, it's the same with any hierarchy of, of anything, right? So if you,

414
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:43,400
if you understand, for example, that love is the highest virtue, right? And so you can also

415
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,000
understand that being good at something at a lower scale, it doesn't compete with that. So you could

416
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,560
be good at your job, but that if you're good at your job, I don't know, like if you're good at,

417
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:00,840
at making shoes, it's like that good can embed itself in love because you can do it in a way

418
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,760
that serves your community or you could do it in a way that's selfish and is just to fill your

419
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:11,320
pockets. But, but there's a manner in which those goods that scale up, they actually don't compete

420
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:17,240
with each other. They fit into each other like of this beautiful fractal dance, right? Everything

421
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,840
kind of embeds itself into, into the rest. They're probably some way to literally define

422
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:28,680
the experience of love being like a higher vibratory state. And then within that, it's like,

423
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:37,000
maybe, maybe you could relate it to like spectrums of light. And there's been kind of a war against

424
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,840
blue light recently. I don't know if you, if you pay attention to things of this sort, like

425
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,720
yeah, exactly, exactly, like where your blue blockers, you know, like the blue light, it's

426
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:52,120
bad, you know, and it's like, no, no, no, no, it's not bad. It's just one frequency that serves a

427
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:59,800
purpose. It's just serves a purpose at, at specific time for specific functions, you know, and so

428
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,400
low, low frequency light and that, you know, infrareds and reds and oranges and all that stuff

429
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:12,120
incredibly valuable. Really high frequency light, you know, the blues and all that, like that's like

430
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:19,000
really valuable. And when, if we're playing the game where like, oh, I'm, I'm tribe blue light and

431
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,800
like, no, no, no, I'm tribe orange light or red light, you know, this is better. It's more healthy.

432
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:30,200
It's like, well, the, the, going back to like the original derivative of health, health comes back to

433
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:36,440
wholeness. So again, like all of this comes back to like, okay, how do we get, if, if what one's

434
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,600
intention is a sensation, probably of, I don't know, like cellular function, you know, and, and

435
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:50,440
satisfaction, probably the conjoining of all of the tribes and being able to actually be able to see

436
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:57,160
that there really is value in, in all of it and not kind of casting any of it out, but actually

437
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,440
coming through, I'm kind of going out into the weeds here, but I think, I think there's the

438
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:07,320
availability to perceive everything through that lens of, of love and acceptance, but not necessarily

439
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:12,440
swallow the pill entirely and say, okay, I'm going to see this state or frequency or whatever

440
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,440
through love and acceptance. So I'm just going to become that and that is all of me. Like I'm able

441
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:24,600
to actually absorb and be with all things, but not get trapped in the kind of the tribalistic

442
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,800
thing that tends to happen where we start to create more segregation, more isolation,

443
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:35,480
and then oftentimes it's in the guise of some higher power. The idea, so in Dante, for example,

444
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:42,600
you see the way that he presents things is perfect. He says that all, let's say, all sin is something

445
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:50,520
like misplaced love or too much love or too little love or not, or love that is kind of twisted.

446
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:57,160
And so the idea is that all things are good if they're properly aligned. Like nothing is bad

447
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,160
in itself. That's ridiculous. Like it's not a, that's definitely not a Christian way of seeing

448
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:06,440
the world. All things are good and that they just have to be in their proper place. So the

449
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,080
urinality of light is a good example. Like, well, obviously, blue light isn't bad. It's, it's just

450
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:18,120
that it has to, it has to be in the proper proportion for what a human being is. And you

451
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:24,280
could say that about things that are maybe, maybe more human, for example. So you could imagine

452
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:30,440
something like entertainment is, is entertainment good or is entertainment bad? And you could say,

453
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:36,360
well, entertainment is good if it's in the proper proportion to other things in your life that are,

454
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:42,920
that are aimed towards, towards bringing all things together in the good. But if you live a

455
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:48,680
life of just entertainment, right? It's like saying is eating dessert bad? It's not bad if,

456
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:55,960
if it's properly ordered, but if you just eat dessert nonstop, then you're going to get sick.

457
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,880
Like it's actually going to affect you. And if you just spend your whole day watching movies and

458
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,840
playing video games, then it's actually going to, it's actually going to affect you. But the other

459
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:09,080
one is true as well. Right? If you spend your whole day working, if you spend your whole day

460
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:14,760
doing whatever it is that you do without giving room for the things that are, that are also good,

461
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,240
then you will, then you, you'll have the same problem from the other side. Well, you're,

462
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:24,280
you're going to become like someone who's super strict with themselves that doesn't leave any

463
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:30,360
room for some play, let's say in terms of personal discipline, is going to crack. Like they're just,

464
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:36,360
at some point they crack and they, they, they kind of collapse. Yeah. There's another, I'll be less

465
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,280
quotacious after this, I think, but there's another quote from Victor Frankel. He said,

466
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,080
something like paraphrase, some long lines of, of those who lack purpose will seek

467
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:50,440
pleasure instead as like a replacement. And I think that kind of turns into like this,

468
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,960
this like hungry ghost type sensation, like this ongoing reaching out for those little hits.

469
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,840
Yeah. Now, because there's that, that lack of foundation of like

470
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:06,840
actually feeling held and supported in a part of a fabric of something bigger than just this self.

471
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,880
Yeah. Well, you could say that that's the, so the drug epidemic in the, in the North America is,

472
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:18,120
seems to be really a product of the meaning crisis, like a product of people not having

473
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:23,720
direction and purpose. And so kind of spiraling into exactly what you said into this,

474
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,320
this more and more extreme desire to, to, to feel something, you know.

475
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,080
Yeah, we just want to feel. Yeah.

476
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,400
How do you, how are you with feeling? Do you feel like, where are you with all these

477
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:41,320
conversations? Like, do you, do you have like a, like any type of, of like,

478
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,800
unquenched yearning sensations that, that I experienced, for example?

479
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,000
Oh, of course. I think that's really part of being human, you know? I mean, it's just,

480
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,080
of course that happens. And, and I think that it's also, if you're conscious about it and you're

481
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:03,400
aware of it, then you can also realize what it is that, what that's for. Now, I think especially

482
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:09,560
sexual desire, the thing that once we, you know, one of the things that happened, right,

483
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,440
in the sixties and then ongoing from there, but there were ways of that before and kind of decadent

484
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:20,600
end of century times is that we had this sense that if we could just satisfy our sexual desires

485
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,560
and proclivities, then, you know, everybody would get along and we'd all be happy. But it turns out

486
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:33,400
that if you focus on that, then it's an unlimited source of frustration because your desires just

487
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,920
get more and more idiosyncratic and bigger and bigger and more and more, you know, you need more

488
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,000
in order to feel, it's almost like it's the same as drugs. Like, it's like, you need more

489
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,760
in order to feel taken further, you could say. The hedonic, the hedonic treadmill.

490
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,480
Exactly. And so if, what, but if you realize that, then you're like, okay, well, you know,

491
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:59,960
how am I going to deal with this? Right? So this, so for example, marriage is a good way to do it

492
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,280
because it's hard to do it on your own. It's really hard because it's like, but if you're married to

493
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:11,960
someone that you love, that person will act as both a, to take a place for your sexual desire,

494
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,280
but also a limit to your sexual desire because it's one person. And it's like,

495
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,880
that person has a limit. Like they have a sexual, they have, especially, especially for men, like

496
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,160
if you're married to a woman, like that woman has a certain limit at some point, it's going to

497
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:30,120
start manifesting itself. And so then you were like, okay, so that feeling, then you feel it,

498
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:36,520
right? Then you feel that, you feel that longing or you feel that lack or that whole that it's

499
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,560
causing in you. And then you can realize too, but you can realize that actually the problem

500
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:46,440
is that the sex doesn't fill that hole. It's, it's fine. There's nothing wrong with sex. Like,

501
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:52,040
sex is great, but it's never going to fill that hole completely because that hole keeps getting

502
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:56,360
bigger for some reason. It just keeps getting, or more weird and more, you know, idiosyncratic.

503
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,720
And so that's, I think that's the real idea of sublimation, you could say. Where it's like,

504
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:10,280
you realize, wait a minute, that suffering and that longing is energy. It's actual, it's actual

505
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:19,160
fuel. And if, and I can redirect that fuel towards other things, and you don't even realize that

506
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:25,640
you, that that exists until you feel it, right? If you're just always kind of somewhat satisfied,

507
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:31,880
you're not going to realize that the, this longing, this longing that you have can be redirected,

508
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:37,880
and it can be redirected towards projects. It can be redirected towards, you know,

509
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,920
accomplishing some great task. It can be redirected towards prayer. It can be redirected

510
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:50,360
in all kinds of directions. And then you, then you can see almost what that longing is for,

511
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:56,520
actually. So definitely, of course, I have, I have that. And I hope that I'm

512
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:03,080
doing as much as possible to make it, to make it fruitful, to make that longing fruitful.

513
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:10,840
How often do you misdirect that energy into like self-destruction and burning yourself up?

514
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:16,920
Yeah, probably all the time, in little ways. I mean, like little moments, it's not, it's not

515
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:23,880
like big things, but like little moments where you, you have a frustration or you have a sense that,

516
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,120
you know, you're not getting what you should in terms of care. I mean, it's not just sex, but it's

517
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:33,640
like, in terms of love, in terms of attention, in terms of this, like, you can feel that every day,

518
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,280
if you're, if you're careful to how you, especially when you're in a family and you,

519
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:44,120
you have all these dynamics. So I would say it happens quite a bit, but, but it's, it's like

520
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:49,240
these little moments where you kind of have to, you have to wake up, you know, and then until

521
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:54,920
you wake up, then you, you end up in these spirals of frustration. But yeah, definitely. I mean,

522
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:01,880
I'm a human being, so it happens quite a bit. The sex one, I think, is especially interesting,

523
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:12,440
because it seems clear that from an evolutionary perspective, it would make sense for humans to

524
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:18,200
yearn to have sex with more than one person. Like, you know, spread the seeds, spread the species,

525
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,040
spread the genetics. What else, you know, what else are we going to do? Yeah. You know, and,

526
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:28,280
and, you know, build shelter, you know, weather the storm, spread your genes, hunt, do it over again.

527
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:35,560
Yeah. And then there's like this, you know, this kind of new world that we exist in and nuclear

528
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:43,560
families and the social contracts and, you know, agreements that kind of in a way sits on top,

529
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:49,240
but also we're working on integrating the two to make it be whole, make it like be health,

530
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:55,480
make it be, you know, religio, make it, you know, all of that. But it feels almost like there's two

531
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:01,880
intersecting tracks in that, like your, your, your primal carnal urges to spread the genes.

532
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:07,720
Yep. And then, you know, like from a, from an evolutionary perspective, males would be

533
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,320
sexually selected based off of those that like the Genghis Khan's of the world would be more

534
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:18,760
spread. But it's your, your insight is great. It's great, but it's important to understand it,

535
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:25,240
that, that it's important to understand it in terms of these higher goods that we talk about.

536
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,800
Right. And so sexuality is probably the easiest way or the best way to understand it,

537
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:38,440
which is that at some point we understand that we have to give up that, some of that,

538
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:45,880
for something which binds us at a higher level. And actually that would be necessary at any,

539
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:51,720
at any scale, like it would be necessary if you just had one male, like in the human species,

540
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:57,480
if you just had one male that was mating with all the women and there, and the other males had no

541
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:05,320
access to women, you would have carnage. If you would just have fighting all the time. And, and,

542
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:12,360
and the truth is that like people idealize hunter-gatherer societies, but you can imagine

543
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:17,560
that people were fighting all the time. And I've been in contact with, with groups that aren't

544
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:24,520
necessarily hunter-gatherers, but have more of that kind of ancient pagan way of being. And that's

545
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:31,560
what happens. People fight over girls non-stop. They fight over women all the time. And people will

546
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:37,400
kill for women, you know. And so this is something which is, and so there's a sense in which you

547
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:43,080
can understand that giving up some of that desire towards higher participation in a society,

548
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:50,280
you can understand that that's fractal, that that's also what you do in you, which is that

549
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:58,760
you realize, oh, if I just focus on pleasure, then I'm not going to be able to

550
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:05,480
accomplish my goals. And so I have to sacrifice some of that. And I have to redirect it towards

551
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,880
something higher, which I perceive as higher, as a, as a higher good. It doesn't mean that

552
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:15,640
those desires are bad or that pleasure is bad. None of that is bad. But I do have to concentrate it

553
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:20,120
and re, reorient it. And then I realize, wait a minute, actually what I get from

554
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:28,520
above, when I, what I get from that is really valuable. And the kind of pleasure that I get,

555
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:35,080
let's say, the pleasure of accomplishing something or the pleasure of, of intellectual,

556
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,920
intellectual understanding, it's a, it's subtle. It's more subtle than an orgasm.

557
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:48,520
But it calls you like it, it calls you and it has a, it has a force that I think that,

558
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:53,800
especially as you get older, like if when you're like 17, it's hard to argue with that with someone

559
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:59,320
who's like just exploding with, with testosterone. But like, as you kind of get into your thirties

560
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:04,360
and you, you kind of get older, you start to see how actually giving up towards these higher

561
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:12,440
participations, they offer you a type of pleasure, which is very different, but is,

562
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:21,320
but is maybe even more valuable. Yeah. My buddy I've had on here called Chris Williamson. I feel

563
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:25,320
like you guys have maybe, have you done the modern wisdom podcast Chris Williamson? I don't think so.

564
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:30,760
Anyways, he's sweet. A term that I got from him is, is post nut clarity.

565
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:41,160
And everything you're saying is true. Yeah. Post ejaculation. Yeah. Yeah. To be able to like

566
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:46,600
sacrifice that like the before, I feel like this kind of comes into, comes back to like,

567
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:53,160
you know, probably a lot of religious philosophies or, or religions or ideologies,

568
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:59,560
but like, like the value of, of sacrifice, you know, and God sacrificing his only son,

569
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:05,080
you know, on the cross to save us all from his sins. And like, yeah, like the, the ethics within

570
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:10,920
that, like they, they, they're, they've been around for a while. And it seems like, so that's

571
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:16,840
kind of at a more macro, you know, like God level. And then individually, I think we can

572
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:22,360
experience that as well. And then I think that's where there is value. But let me give you just

573
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:26,920
an example based on what you just said, which is that think about, like when I say giving yourself

574
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,960
to a higher good. So think about you're in a situation and you could sleep with your friend's

575
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,760
girlfriend, like she's up for it, but you know the consequence of that, right? You know what

576
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:44,600
that's going to cost you. And so you decide that actually the friendship I have, my friend,

577
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:52,760
is more valuable than the immediate pleasure. And so you sacrifice that moment, that possibility

578
00:56:53,320 --> 00:57:00,440
in order to be bound to a relationship, right? So you can imagine that at multiple levels,

579
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,600
like that kind of decision. That's the kind of decision that I'm talking about, which is that

580
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:12,680
you're actually, you're sacrificing immediate, I mean, it's just like delayed satisfaction. But

581
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:17,080
I mean, you can think of it even at a higher level, which is not just that you delay it for later,

582
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:24,200
you're giving it up towards something higher, something more that is less bodily pleasure,

583
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,960
but it is a more kind of spiritual pleasure, you could say.

584
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:35,800
So we're not going to have enough time to actually go into the Bible and religion

585
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:41,480
in the way that I would like to, because I was raised very Christian doing Bible study,

586
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:48,920
hanging out with my bros, talking about Jesus, sharing scriptures and such, then got into psychedelics

587
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:56,200
and kind of Buddhism and like other versions of isms and that kind of the concept of like hell

588
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:07,080
seems quite unreasonable. So I wonder your perspective on the, how literal could one take

589
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:14,440
the Bible from your perspective? Like, is it meant to be symbolism, metaphor, allegory,

590
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:20,040
is it meant to be 100% literal? How does one define how literal the Bible is?

591
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:25,160
So or the Quran or the literal thing, I hate that word.

592
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:31,480
First of all, the word literal means according to the text, like that's what the word literal

593
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:40,440
means. People think that the word literal means that what is described is a description of events

594
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:46,120
in the way that I think events should be described. And sometimes I'm not even sure what that is.

595
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,160
It's like the way that you would describe events to a police officer, maybe,

596
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:55,800
like if it was the scene of a crime, some kind of forensic, like encyclopedic description of

597
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:01,400
an event, like that's what it should be. And so we think that when we say the Bible is literal,

598
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:08,040
then that's what we're describing. And I think that that's just not what's going on there.

599
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:14,920
The Bible is definitely a description of events, but it's not trying to describe those events

600
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:22,360
in a way that would satisfy a modern rationalist in any way. Like it is a description of events

601
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:29,720
which compresses elements together in order to make them meaningful over a very long span of time.

602
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:37,080
And so because of that, they have a certain form and a certain trope, which is necessary,

603
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:43,000
because if you don't do that, if you don't compress elements of a story into something like

604
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:48,680
universal imagery, then it's going to, no one's going to understand it. So think about,

605
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:55,400
so think about like if someone watched, someone from the 15th century watched pulp fiction,

606
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,800
like they would have no idea what they're watching. Like what am I watching? What are these things

607
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:04,840
people have in their hands and what are these things that people are drawing, like putting up

608
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:10,040
their nose or like, what are they, what is this? Like this doesn't mean anything because it's so

609
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:15,880
idiosyncratic. In the Bible, what you have is you have stories that have been compressed and

610
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:23,320
condensed and are telling the events in a way that that's just what it is. And so the idea that

611
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:30,360
the first chapter of Genesis is like some is, could be seen as a scientific description is

612
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,360
absolute nonsense. Like it's complete nonsense. And so I'm sorry to all the creationists who

613
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,600
think that that's what's going on there. It's just not, it's just not. And but the problem is that

614
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:43,640
it doesn't have to be the idea that that's what's valuable. The idea that a scientific

615
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,680
description of an event is what is supremely valuable and everything should conform to that

616
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:54,680
standard is pure nonsense. And so the description of let's say the creation in the first chapter of

617
01:00:54,680 --> 01:01:03,400
Genesis is in my, I think is the most powerful and accurate description of the manner in which the

618
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:09,320
world exists. But it is not doing it in a way that like I said, it's not a biologist description.

619
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:14,120
It's the description of a hierarchy of meaning, a hierarchy of participation, you know,

620
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:20,760
so the centrality of consciousness, the centrality of recognizing the good in the world, these things

621
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:26,760
have nothing to do with what they have very little to do with the way that that that a kind of

622
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,640
forensic description would be. So I think that all the stories in scripture have to be taken very

623
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:36,680
seriously. Now that you're taken seriously out of description of events, but we don't have to

624
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:41,080
figure out what the mechanical causes are behind some of the things that are there.

625
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:46,680
So people are like reading. So like, I don't know, you read in the book of Joshua that the sun

626
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:50,520
stopped, you know, for 24 hours and people are like, well, how is that possible? Trying to

627
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,760
figure out like how the earth could move and what this could happen? How could I describe the

628
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:00,600
mechanical causation of that? It's like, dude, stop it. What are you doing? Who cares? There's a

629
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:06,600
reason why things are described that way. The reason have to do with their meaning. And so you

630
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:11,640
don't have to understand what it is that if you had a video camera, you would be filming and you

631
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:17,480
could you could capture on a video camera. But it also doesn't mean that what it's saying is just

632
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:23,400
something someone made up. It's a description of something in a way that emphasizes its meaning.

633
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:30,520
And it's, you know, it's it's so it's a it's a it's a kind of mythological language. But in the

634
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:37,320
Bible, at least it's it they they they're describing some kind of event, maybe from a distance, maybe

635
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:44,600
from, you know, several generations after maybe from that type of memory, but it but it is a memory

636
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:49,880
of something. Yeah, I analogy, and it's too bad we only have a little bit of time left because

637
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,880
I feel like this would be I'm like unpacking something that would be probably several hours of

638
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:59,000
conversation. So, you know, maybe we can come back another time or something. But but an example

639
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,240
to my is like last night, I've been writing my dreams down last night, I had a dream where I was

640
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:10,040
like, in this German war zone scenario, and I was like, on my hands and knees and crawling around

641
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:16,360
through puddles and hiding behind car tire things. And I had a gun, and I like lost the gun, and I

642
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:20,520
was trying to find the gun. And then I had to report back. It was all this stuff. And within

643
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:24,440
that, I think if I were to like retrace and be like, Okay, I need to understand this dream. So,

644
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:28,520
I'm going to go to Germany. I'm going to try to find this place. I'm going to try to like,

645
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:33,560
in account of this guy's like, no, no, like, no, it was like, there was a gun. There was truth

646
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:39,320
within the dream. It just wasn't exactly as you know, literal as like your waking consciousness

647
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:44,680
may want to define it as this kind of what I'm maybe perhaps gathering and that might be a little

648
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:50,040
bit of a stretch, but but even like your waking consciousness. Now, so think about how right

649
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:54,920
now, let's say around you, there, there's millions of things happening at the same time. There's like

650
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:59,960
billions and billions of things happening simultaneously around you. And so in order

651
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:09,240
for you to make sense of that, you have to draw phenomena into coherent through a coherent line.

652
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,480
So even if it's just your day, like you went through your day, you get home, like there are

653
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:17,560
millions of things that happen to you that day, like millions and millions and millions. And so

654
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:21,800
but then you tell the story of your day, what you're going to do is you're going to compress,

655
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,080
you're going to take the elements that are meaningful, and you're going to compress them

656
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:31,080
together in a manner in which you are going to show the line that connects these elements together.

657
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:39,320
Okay, so that's how we do it. Now, think of that now over a thousand years instead of over one day.

658
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:47,560
Think of how I can do that in a manner in which I would have to tell the story of my day to someone

659
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:53,400
in a thousand years. And so there's a kind of compression that happens. And that compression

660
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,840
doesn't mean that it's like I said, it doesn't mean that you didn't have a day or that

661
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,800
but it means that there are so many examples that I could give you. But like, let's say

662
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:08,920
a simple example would be, let's say in that story of the German story,

663
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:13,560
your dream, you're trying to tell that to someone. You're trying to tell that to someone who lives,

664
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:20,920
who's a Maasai in Kenya, right, from 500 years ago. And so are you going to say you had a gun?

665
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,960
No, you're going to say I had a weapon, right? You're going to say something like I had a

666
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:31,640
weapon in my hands. But that Maasai, they only understand a weapon to be something like a lance.

667
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:36,840
But they might have the same dream or a totally different dream with the same like undercurrent

668
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:42,760
of truth. They'll have a lance in their hand instead of a gun. Yeah. And so that's the type

669
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:50,760
of contraction that I'm saying. It's like if I say a sword, that has way more power than if I say

670
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:57,320
a Glock. Because a Glock is like a super reduced version. And even if I say a gun is better than

671
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:02,440
if I name like the brand of the thing. It's like this, it's this compression of elements

672
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:10,040
that is what ancient storytelling was doing and what you find in scripture. So some of them reach

673
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:17,880
levels that are so high, like a serpent, you know, like a tree, like a, like a garden. These

674
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:25,640
elements are now universal and so compressed. I'm going to ask about something just to generally

675
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:33,160
put it into the ether to reflect upon. I'm curious to your perception of things like the ancient

676
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,960
fertility cults, like the sacred mushroom and the cross book, the John Allegro book and

677
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,600
Ellucinian mysteries and, you know, all of like the mystery cults of Greece, etc. And the potential

678
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:52,280
of, you know, ergot or LSD being used to as like these like death, death and rebirth ceremonies.

679
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:57,640
And a lot of what we gather from the Bible in fact has influenced from the psychedelic experience

680
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:04,040
and conflation of these different like ancient practices into what we now call, you know,

681
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:15,240
Bible and God and death and rebirth and. Well, let me say this. I think that it is 60 seconds.

682
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:21,640
What do you think about that? No, but I what I do think is that it is exactly a

683
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:29,240
it is exactly an image of the reductionism at which we've arrived in terms of modern

684
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:35,720
scientism, which is that we want to find the substance. What's the chemical? Like what's the

685
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:41,880
chemical? What's the what's the binding thing? You know, what's the what's the what's the medicine?

686
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:49,080
And that's what we think is happening. So the whole psychedelic Ellucinian mysteries things

687
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:54,680
is hilarious. I find it just hilarious, which is that the Ellucinian ministries lasted what three

688
01:07:54,680 --> 01:08:03,080
days, four days of nonstop like rituals, all like that would take you through an entire process

689
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:08,200
that was extremely complex and that no one knows about because everybody has kept it a secret.

690
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:14,760
And then you get to the end of it. And then you have a final revelation. Now, whether or not that

691
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:23,480
revelation might have been supplemented by some chemical is possible. But the idea that that's

692
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:29,240
what it is is absolutely ridiculous. It's completely ridiculous. And even people who talk

693
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:35,560
about the psychedelics, it's like, how about if we talk about, let's at least talk about the vision

694
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:39,800
instead of talking about the stupid mushroom, like it's like they just people get obsessed with the

695
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:44,760
stupid mushroom, like let's at least talk about the vision and see the coherence of the vision

696
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:50,040
across the different traditions. Let's at least talk about that. But the idea that so for example,

697
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:57,880
like the only thing that's closest to the so called mystery cults right now in the world is

698
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:05,000
the Christian liturgy. That's the closest thing that you can have, because it is it is a a death

699
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,880
and rebirth ritual through baptism. It is a movement into a scandalous mystery, which is

700
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:14,680
the Eucharist, a revelation at the end of participation and eating the body of a God.

701
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:21,000
Like that is that's what Christianity is. But the idea that if we could just have psychedelics,

702
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:27,320
well, no, no, no, no, that's, that's more just, that's more just like an interesting kind of thing

703
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:31,720
to hang to like a handle to grab one toes, like, oh, interesting. I think that there's like,

704
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:37,240
or deal poisoning, you know, like the form of like fasting, and, you know, there's, there's

705
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:41,480
like the sun dance, Native American sun dance thing, or you're fasting for several days, and

706
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:45,000
you're dancing around a tree, and then you're hung from the tree, and you're going through this like

707
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,080
death and rebirth, like losing of the body, you're finally coming to a point where

708
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:54,600
your body is so drained, you think you're on the edge of of transitioning out of the body,

709
01:09:54,600 --> 01:10:00,600
and suddenly there's this like, oh, okay, I'm rebirthed again, you know, I'm born again,

710
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,680
like that, I think that happens many in many different scenarios, like a right of passage

711
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:08,840
in culture is very common, but it's something that, you know, I don't know that there's a definitive

712
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:14,280
right of passage in Western culture, for the most part, but it doesn't need to be psychedelics per

713
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:20,600
say, just something. Well, we have something called baptism, which is, which is, which is that, and

714
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:26,360
it is, it is definitely a death and rebirth. There's also the, so the idea of reaching these

715
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:32,840
states through fasting is probably much better, because the problem with the psychedelics, and I

716
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:40,520
can see it, it's that at least my, my encounter with people that have just done psychedelics is that

717
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:46,440
I don't think they come back with, not sure they come back with much, like I'm not that impressed

718
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:52,440
with, with the things that I've heard people come back with. Some of it seems really confused,

719
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:58,600
like some of it seems, because it's like you rip the veil off, and then you enter into a world of,

720
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:05,800
of encounters with, let's say, transpersonal beings, but it's like they're all kinds of

721
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:10,920
transpersonal beings, like it's not as if everything that exists in the, in the invisible

722
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:18,360
is there to help you and is good, like that's not true. And so I, I feel like there's a lot of,

723
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:22,520
and so I'm not, I'm not totally discounting it, like I'm not saying that it's evil or whatever,

724
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:28,120
I'm just, I just am not super impressed, and like I, I'm not impressed at what psychedelics did

725
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:35,400
to, in the 60s, to our culture, and I am very wary about them coming back right now, because

726
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:41,880
we, we're in a worse place than we were in the 60s, like we are, we are in a more disjointed,

727
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:50,360
broken, narcissistic space than people were in the 60s. So imagining that coming back, I don't know,

728
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:56,280
man. I mean, it'd be tough. I mean, now it's becoming like more of like a passionate conversation,

729
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:01,160
and now we're going to, we're going to close it, but I mean, it's tough to say that anything as

730
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:05,240
an absolute, like you could, like there's suggestions that Francis Crick, part of his

731
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:11,240
discovery of the triple helix model was a product of him using, I think it was LSD,

732
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:16,440
and taking this huge, you know, massive information that he's been aggregating,

733
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:20,360
and then through that psychedelic experience or, you know, whatever you work on, psychedelics,

734
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,920
another one of those words, kind of like Spirit of God, whatever, it's got a lot of,

735
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:27,320
a lot of flakes on it. Those seemingly like disparate connections that he was, he was in

736
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:31,400
these different tunnels, suddenly like fused for a moment, and then he comes out of that

737
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:35,640
experience because he's done so much work in his like, his other world.

738
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:39,880
Yeah, so you could understand it, you could understand that that's probably

739
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:45,800
what something that the Ellucian Mysteries were offering. They would create a massive ritual that

740
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:51,640
lasted several days, and then in the last moment, there would be some, they would use some supplement,

741
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:57,480
and that that would, so you can imagine like, there's a little residue, a little residue of that

742
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:03,000
in Christian communion, especially in the monastic sphere where someone would be fasting for,

743
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:08,520
would be fasting probably for a whole day, or at least maybe more before they would take communion,

744
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:13,640
and then there would be a little bit of that with, in terms of, obviously it's not psychedelic,

745
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:21,480
but a little bit of, let's say, a little help to kind of break down some things with taking

746
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:28,600
wine after having fasted for a few days. Yeah, and I think the confusion as well could

747
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:34,200
make sense, the sensation of like, oh, like what you're saying doesn't feel so cogent,

748
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:40,760
and perhaps within some of those, I don't know, like super conscious states, for lack of better

749
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:47,240
words, maybe a person kind of stumbles in territory that's not as effable as like what they would

750
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:50,680
read or, you know, or regurgitate out of a book, and it's kind of like- Yeah, well, they don't,

751
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:56,120
people rarely talk about the bad trip. People don't talk about the bad trip for some reason,

752
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:01,080
because I mean, I have witnessed people, like I have witnessed people in my

753
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:06,760
surrounding kind of just go down that route, and I mean, I don't know if it's because they were

754
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:11,400
already psychologically fragile, but like I've watched them break apart, like I've watched them

755
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:21,240
go into a psychotic state as soon as really hard things started to present themselves to them.

756
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:29,320
So yeah, so I think that I do worry about this cold resurgence of psychedelics right now. I

757
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:34,920
definitely, I worry about it because I'm afraid people are going to see it as an easy way in.

758
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:39,880
It's like, well, just take this pill, you know, you want to know what spirituality is? Just take

759
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:49,640
this pill. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a lot to say there. At least for some people, it seems to be

760
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:56,760
that like- Certainly, you can, I think a person can develop a dependence on, you know, a clergy

761
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:01,880
person can develop a dependence on the idea of God, you know, and then wearing that as a mask,

762
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:06,120
and putting on the robe and putting on the cross, and there's that, that exists, a spiritual person

763
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:10,440
can do that with the beads, you know, like there's a lot of different versions of that, and someone

764
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:14,440
could wear an ayahuasca route around their neck, and like that's their thing, and they go back and

765
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:20,040
they do their own psychedelic baptism every six months, but they don't actually resource themselves

766
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:30,280
in their waking life to be able to fulfill some of the lessons that they garnered during that

767
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:34,440
experience. So they just go back to their previous momentum, and that's when it becomes kind of

768
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:39,720
bullshitty, where it's like, no, no, like the window gets opened in various different ways.

769
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:43,960
You can have a near-death experience, you could fall in love, you could eat way too many mushrooms,

770
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:49,480
you know, or whatever, you know, wow, like the window is out, the veil has been thinned,

771
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:53,960
and now the window closes, now what do you do with it? And I think that's the difference between

772
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:58,920
someone that's like a Michael Pollan, for example, where people seem to like respect his perspective,

773
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:03,160
and like the rainbow gathering person that still doesn't have a job, and you know, still

774
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:07,720
isn't really like that effective in society, which effective, I don't really like, you know,

775
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:13,160
it's a dumb thing to say, but you know what I mean? So that's, there's nuance to everything,

776
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:18,040
including religion, including the psychedelic experience, including, you know, everything.

777
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:23,080
Yeah, well, I've never done psychedelics, so I'm definitely not, I don't, I want to be careful

778
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:31,960
that I'm not, that I'm not being too harsh, but I do see, like, I don't know, I do see that it's,

779
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:36,600
the fact that it's so public, and everybody's talking about it so publicly, I think it worries

780
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:42,200
me, you know. For good reason. Even at the time of the, if there was part of something like the

781
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:47,400
Elusinian mysteries, and if it was part of some of the rituals that existed in the past, and it

782
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:52,440
would always have been like secret, it would always have been something that was kept, because

783
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:58,760
it's also very dangerous. So, and it doesn't get conflated into like an egoic badge of honor,

784
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:04,920
which then it's kind of tripping back into that previous momentum of, you know, egotism or whatever.

785
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:10,120
Now, suddenly, you're like, the ego is so strong, that you had so much momentum in that, now you're

786
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:15,640
taking this divine quotations, or maybe not in quotations experience, and you're actually

787
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:21,160
leveraging the divine to bolster the ego. And that's like, oh, like, all right, what do we do with

788
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:26,520
that? You know, and then, you know, that's a whole other conversation. Thanks, man. I hope.

789
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:30,200
I'm gonna, yeah, I need to go now, but it was good to, it was good to meet you, took me in

790
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:36,600
surprising places. Good times. Is there a place that people ought to be directed to go from here,

791
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:40,840
if they want to go deeper into your stuff, your podcast and YouTube? And people can check out the

792
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:46,040
symbolicworld.com. That's my website. And that's where you'll find most of the, like, I have a

793
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:50,040
presence on YouTube, and there's a podcast version of what I'm doing. And there's a group, like a

794
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:55,240
kind of community of people around that are writing articles about this kind of symbolic thinking,

795
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:58,120
a symbolic vision of the world. So yeah, people can check that out.

796
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:02,600
Right. Thank you, man. At some point, we'd love to run it back and maybe start with the

797
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,480
start with the Bible stuff. Start with the Bible stuff.

798
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:18,520
All right. That is it. That is all. Thank you all for tuning in. And I'll see you all soon.
