00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
Postmodernism presents a threat not only to liberal democracy, but to modernity itself.

00:05.920 --> 00:11.040
That may sound like a bold or even a hyperbolic claim, but the reality is that the cluster of

00:11.040 --> 00:16.480
ideas and values at the root of postmodernism have broken the bounds of academia and gained great

00:16.480 --> 00:22.320
cultural power in western society. The irrational and identitarian symptoms of postmodernism

00:22.320 --> 00:28.400
are easily recognizable and much criticized, but the ethos underlying them is not well understood.

00:28.480 --> 00:33.360
This is partly because postmodernists rarely explain themselves clearly and partly because

00:33.360 --> 00:38.400
of the inherent contradictions and inconsistencies of a way of thought that denies that a stable

00:38.400 --> 00:44.800
reality or reliable knowledge exists. However, there are consistent ideas at the root of postmodernism

00:44.800 --> 00:49.600
and understanding them is essential if we intend to counter them. They underlie the problems we

00:49.600 --> 00:54.640
see today in social justice activism, undermine the credibility of the left and threaten to return

00:54.640 --> 01:00.320
us to an irrational and tribal pre-modern culture. Postmodernism, most simply, is an artistic and

01:00.320 --> 01:06.160
philosophical movement which began in France in the 1960s and produced bewildering art and even

01:06.160 --> 01:11.840
more bewildering theory. It drew on avant-garde and surrealist art and earlier philosophical ideas,

01:11.840 --> 01:16.640
particularly those of Nietzsche and Heidegger, for its anti-realism and rejection of the concept of

01:16.640 --> 01:21.520
the unified and coherent individual. It reacted against the liberal humanism of modernist,

01:21.600 --> 01:27.440
artistic and intellectual movements which its proponents saw as naively universalizing a western,

01:27.440 --> 01:33.040
middle class and male experience. It rejected philosophy which valued ethics, reason and

01:33.040 --> 01:38.880
clarity with the same accusation. Structuralism, a movement which, often over confidently,

01:38.880 --> 01:44.240
attempted to analyze human culture and psychology according to consistent structures of relationships,

01:44.240 --> 01:49.680
came under attack. Marxism, with its understanding of society through class and economic structures,

01:49.680 --> 01:55.280
was regarded as equally rigid and simplistic. Above all, postmodernists attacked science and

01:55.280 --> 02:00.400
its goal of obtaining objective knowledge about a reality that exists independently of human

02:00.400 --> 02:06.320
perceptions, which they saw as merely another form of constructed ideology dominated by bourgeois

02:06.320 --> 02:12.240
western assumptions. Decidedly left wing, postmodernism had both a nihilistic and a revolutionary

02:12.240 --> 02:18.640
ethos which resonated with a post-war post-empire zeitgeist in the west, as postmodernism continued

02:18.720 --> 02:24.240
to develop and diversify, its initially stronger nihilistic deconstructive phase became secondary,

02:24.240 --> 02:29.280
but still fundamental to its revolutionary identity politics phase. It has been a matter

02:29.280 --> 02:34.480
of contention whether postmodernism is a reaction against modernity. The modern era is the period

02:34.480 --> 02:39.120
of history which saw Renaissance humanism, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution and

02:39.120 --> 02:44.080
the development of liberal values and human rights. The period when western societies gradually came

02:44.080 --> 02:49.200
to value reason and science over faith and superstition as roots to knowledge and developed a

02:49.200 --> 02:54.640
concept of the person as an individual member of the human race deserving of rights and freedoms

02:54.640 --> 02:59.600
rather than as part of various collectives subject to rigid hierarchical roles in society.

02:59.600 --> 03:04.800
The Encyclopedia Britannica says postmodernism, quote, is largely a reaction against the

03:04.800 --> 03:09.440
philosophical assumptions and values of the modern period of western, specifically European

03:09.920 --> 03:13.920
history. Whilst the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy denies this and says,

03:13.920 --> 03:18.880
rather its differences lie within modernity itself, and postmodernism is a continuation

03:18.880 --> 03:24.080
of modern thinking in another mode. I'd suggest that the difference lies in whether we see modernity

03:24.080 --> 03:29.920
in terms of what was produced or what was destroyed. If we see the essence of modernity as the development

03:29.920 --> 03:35.040
of science and reason, as well as humanism and universal liberalism, postmodernists are opposed

03:35.040 --> 03:39.760
to it. If we see modernity as the tearing down of structures of power, including feudalism,

03:39.760 --> 03:44.960
the church, patriarchy and empire, postmodernists are attempting to continue it, but their targets

03:44.960 --> 03:50.480
are now science, reason, humanism and liberalism. Consequently, the roots of postmodernism are

03:50.480 --> 03:55.200
inherently political and revolutionary, albeit in a destructive, or as they would term it,

03:55.200 --> 03:59.920
deconstructive, way. Jean-François Lyotard

03:59.920 --> 04:07.280
The term postmodern was coined by Jean-François Lyotard in his 1979 book The Postmodern Condition.

04:07.280 --> 04:13.120
He defined the postmodern condition as, quote, an incredulity towards meta-narratives.

04:13.120 --> 04:18.800
A meta-narrative is a wide-ranging and cohesive explanation for large phenomena. Religions and

04:18.800 --> 04:24.320
other totalizing ideologies are meta-narratives in their attempts to explain the meaning of life

04:24.320 --> 04:31.360
or all of society's ills. Lyotard advocated replacing these with, quote, mini-narratives,

04:31.360 --> 04:36.800
to get at smaller and more personal truths. He addressed Christianity and Marxism in this way,

04:36.800 --> 04:42.720
but also science. In his view, quote, there is a strict interlinkage between the kind of language

04:42.720 --> 04:48.160
called science and the kind called ethics and politics. By telling science the knowledge it

04:48.160 --> 04:53.920
produces to government and power, he rejects its claim to objectivity. Lyotard describes this

04:53.920 --> 04:58.960
incredulous postmodern condition as a general one and argues that from the end of the 19th century,

04:58.960 --> 05:04.000
quote, an internal erosion of the legitimacy principle of knowledge began to cause a change

05:04.000 --> 05:09.760
in the status of knowledge. By the 1960s, the resulting doubt and demoralization of scientists

05:09.760 --> 05:15.920
in Lyotard's words, had, quote, made an impact on the central problem of legitimization. No

05:15.920 --> 05:20.800
number of scientists telling him they are not demoralized nor any more doubtful than befits

05:20.800 --> 05:25.520
the practitioner's own method whose results are always provisional and whose hypotheses are never

05:25.520 --> 05:31.840
proven could sway him from this. We see in Lyotard an explicit epistemic relativism,

05:31.840 --> 05:37.440
belief in personal or culturally specific truths or facts, and the advocacy of privileging, quote,

05:37.440 --> 05:43.360
lived experience over empirical evidence. We see, too, the promotion of a version of pluralism

05:43.360 --> 05:48.480
that privileges the views of minority groups over the general consensus of scientists or liberal

05:48.480 --> 05:53.920
democratic ethics, which are presented as authoritarian and dogmatic. This is consistent

05:53.920 --> 05:59.680
in postmodern thought. Michel Foucault. Michel Foucault's work is also centered on language

05:59.680 --> 06:05.440
and relativism, although he applied this to history and culture. We call this approach archaeology

06:05.440 --> 06:10.480
because he saw himself as, quote, uncovering aspects of historical culture through recorded

06:10.480 --> 06:16.720
discourses, speech that promotes or assumes a particular view. For Foucault, discourses control

06:16.720 --> 06:21.840
what can be known, and in different periods and places, different systems of institutional power

06:21.840 --> 06:27.440
control discourses. Therefore, knowledge is a direct product of power, quote. In any given

06:27.440 --> 06:33.120
culture and at any given moment, there is always only one episteme that defines the conditions

06:33.120 --> 06:38.640
of possibility of all knowledge, whether expressed in theory or silently invested in a practice.

06:38.640 --> 06:43.520
Furthermore, people themselves were culturally constructed, quote. The individual with his

06:43.520 --> 06:48.640
identity and characteristics is the product of a relation of power exercised over bodies,

06:48.640 --> 06:54.960
multiplicities, movements, desires, forces. He leaves almost no room for individual agency

06:54.960 --> 07:00.400
or autonomy. As Christopher Butler says, Foucault, quote, relies on beliefs about the inherent evil

07:00.400 --> 07:05.920
of the individual's class position or professional position seen as discourse, regardless of the

07:05.920 --> 07:11.360
morality of his or her individual conduct. He presents medieval feudalism and modern liberal

07:11.360 --> 07:16.880
democracies equally oppressive and advocates criticizing and attacking institutions to unmask

07:16.880 --> 07:22.240
the, quote, political violence that has always exercised itself obscurely through them. We see

07:22.240 --> 07:27.840
in Foucault the most extreme expression of cultural relativism, read through structures of power in which

07:27.840 --> 07:33.360
shared humanity and individuality are almost entirely absent. Instead, people are constructed

07:33.360 --> 07:39.040
by their position in relation to dominant cultural ideas, either as oppressors or oppressed. Judith

07:39.040 --> 07:43.680
Butler drew on Foucault for her foundational role in queer theory, focusing on the culturally

07:43.680 --> 07:48.480
constructed nature of gender, as did Edward Said in his similar role in postcolonialism

07:48.480 --> 07:53.040
and orientalism, and Kimberly Crenshaw in her development of intersectionality and

07:53.040 --> 07:58.640
advocacy of identity politics. We see, too, the equation of language with violence and coercion

07:58.640 --> 08:04.560
and the equation of reason and universal liberalism with oppression. Jacques Derrida. It was Jacques

08:04.560 --> 08:10.640
Derrida who introduced the concept of deconstruction, and he, too, argued for cultural constructivism

08:10.640 --> 08:15.680
and cultural and personal relativism. He focuses even more explicitly on language.

08:15.680 --> 08:21.360
Derrida's best-known pronouncement, there is no outside text, relates to his rejection of the

08:21.360 --> 08:27.520
idea that words refer to anything straightforwardly. Rather, quote, there are only contexts without any

08:27.520 --> 08:32.880
center of absolute anchoring. Therefore, the author of a text is not the authority on its meaning.

08:32.880 --> 08:38.160
The reader or listener makes their own equally valid meaning, and every text, quote, engenders

08:38.160 --> 08:44.080
infinitely new contexts in an absolutely non-saturable fashion. Derrida coined the

08:44.080 --> 08:50.000
term Difference, which he derived from the verb Differer, which means both to defer and to differ.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.280
This was to indicate that not only is meaning never final, but it is constructed by differences,

08:55.280 --> 09:01.200
specifically by oppositions. The word young only makes sense in its relation with the word old,

09:01.200 --> 09:06.320
and he argued, following so-soor, that meaning is constructed by the conflict of these elemental

09:06.320 --> 09:12.320
oppositions, which to him always form a positive and negative. Man is positive, and woman negative.

09:12.320 --> 09:18.160
Occident is positive, and Orient negative. He insisted that we are not dealing with a peaceful

09:18.160 --> 09:24.400
coexistence with visa v, but rather with a violent hierarchy. One of the two terms governs the other,

09:24.400 --> 09:30.880
axiologically, logically, etc., or has the upper hand. To deconstruct the opposition, first of all,

09:30.880 --> 09:36.320
is to overturn the hierarchy at a given moment. Deconstruction, therefore, involves inverting

09:36.320 --> 09:42.640
these perceived hierarchies, making woman and Orient positive, and man and Occident negative.

09:42.640 --> 09:47.280
This is to be done ironically, to reveal the culturally constructed and arbitrary nature

09:47.280 --> 09:52.640
of these perceived oppositions in unequal conflict. We see in Derrida further relativism,

09:52.640 --> 09:57.120
both cultural and epistemic, and further justification for identity politics.

09:57.120 --> 10:01.760
There is an explicit denial that differences can be other than oppositional, and therefore a

10:01.760 --> 10:06.960
rejection of Enlightenment liberalism's values of overcoming differences, and focusing on universal

10:06.960 --> 10:11.440
human rights and individual freedom and empowerment. We see here the basis of quote,

10:11.440 --> 10:17.440
ironic misundry, and the mantra, reverse racism isn't real, and the idea that identity dictates

10:17.440 --> 10:22.800
what can be understood. We see too a rejection of the need for clarity in speech and argument,

10:22.800 --> 10:26.400
and to understand the other's point of view and avoid misinterpretation.

10:26.400 --> 10:31.120
The intention of the speaker is irrelevant. What matters is the impact of speech. This,

10:31.120 --> 10:36.000
along with Foucaultian ideas, underlies the current belief in the deeply damaging nature of

10:36.000 --> 10:41.280
microaggressions, and misuse of terminology related to gender, race, or sexuality.

10:41.280 --> 10:46.000
Lyotard, Foucault, and Derrida are just three of the founding fathers of post-modernism,

10:46.000 --> 10:51.120
but their ideas share common themes with other influential theorists, and will taken up later

10:51.120 --> 10:55.280
by post-modernists who apply them to an increasingly diverse range of disciplines

10:55.280 --> 10:59.600
within the social sciences and humanities. We've seen that this includes an intense

10:59.600 --> 11:04.560
sensitivity to language on the level of the word, and a feeling that what the speaker means is less

11:04.560 --> 11:09.920
important than how it is received, no matter how radical the interpretation. Shared humanity and

11:09.920 --> 11:15.280
individuality are essentially illusions, and people are propagators or victims of discourses

11:15.280 --> 11:20.080
depending on their social position, a position that is dependent on identity, far more than on

11:20.160 --> 11:25.920
their individual engagement with society. Morality is culturally relative, as is reality itself.

11:25.920 --> 11:31.200
Empirical evidence is suspect, and so are any culturally dominant ideas, including science,

11:31.200 --> 11:36.480
reason, and universal liberalism. Far more important are the lived experience, narratives,

11:36.480 --> 11:41.760
and beliefs of marginalised groups, all of which are equally quote-unquote true, but must now be

11:41.760 --> 11:46.880
privileged over enlightenment values, to reverse an oppressive, unjust, and entirely arbitrary

11:46.880 --> 11:52.320
social construction of reality, morality, and knowledge. The desire to smash the status quo,

11:52.320 --> 11:57.200
challenge widely held values in institutions, and champion the marginalised is absolutely

11:57.200 --> 12:02.800
liberal in ethos. Opposing it is resolutely conservative. This is the historical reality.

12:02.800 --> 12:08.160
But we are at a unique point in history, where the status quo is fairly consistently liberal,

12:08.160 --> 12:12.720
with a liberalism that upholds the values of freedom, equal rights, and opportunities for

12:12.720 --> 12:18.560
everyone, regardless of gender, race, or sexuality. The result is confusion, in which lifelong liberals

12:18.560 --> 12:23.280
wishing to conserve this kind of liberal status quo, find themselves considered conservative,

12:23.280 --> 12:28.560
and those wishing to avoid conservatism at all costs, find themselves defending irrationalism

12:28.560 --> 12:33.440
and illiberalism. Whilst the first post-modernists mostly challenge discourse with discourse,

12:33.440 --> 12:37.920
the activists motivated by their ideas are becoming more authoritarian, and following

12:37.920 --> 12:42.160
those ideas to their logical conclusion. Freedom of speech is under threat, because

12:42.160 --> 12:47.280
speech is now dangerous. So dangerous that people considering themselves liberal can now justify

12:47.280 --> 12:53.120
responding to it with violence. The need to argue a case persuasively using reasoned argument is now

12:53.120 --> 12:58.720
often replaced with references to identity and pure rage. Despite all the evidence that racism,

12:58.720 --> 13:04.320
sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia are at an all-time low in western societies,

13:04.320 --> 13:10.560
leftist academics and social justice activists display a fatalistic pessimism enabled by post-modern

13:10.560 --> 13:16.080
interpretative reading practices that valorize confirmation bias. The authoritarian power of

13:16.080 --> 13:20.640
the post-modern academics and activists seems to be invisible to them whilst being apparent to

13:20.640 --> 13:26.320
everyone else, as Andrew Sullivan says of intersectionality. It posits a classic orthodoxy,

13:26.320 --> 13:30.640
through which all of human experience is explained, and through which all speech must

13:30.640 --> 13:36.400
be filtered. Like the puritanism once familiar in New England, intersectionality controls language

13:36.400 --> 13:41.840
and the very terms of discourse. Post-modernism has become a leotardian metanarrative,

13:41.840 --> 13:47.440
a Foucaudian system of discursive power, and a deridian oppressive hierarchy. The logical problem

13:47.440 --> 13:52.400
of self-referentiality has been pointed out to post-modernists by philosophers fairly constantly,

13:52.400 --> 13:56.880
but it is one they have yet to address convincingly. As Christopher Butler points out,

13:57.120 --> 14:02.000
the plausibility of Leotard's claim for the decline of metanarratives in the late 20th century

14:02.000 --> 14:06.800
ultimately depends upon an appeal to the cultural condition of an intellectual minority. In other

14:06.800 --> 14:11.600
words, Leotard's claim comes directly from the discourses surrounding him in his bourgeois

14:11.600 --> 14:17.360
academic bubble, and is in fact a metanarrative towards which he is not remotely incredulous.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.920
Equally, Foucaud's argument that knowledge is historically contingent must itself be

14:21.920 --> 14:26.400
historically contingent, and one wonders why Derridaugh bothered to explain the infinite

14:26.400 --> 14:31.120
malleability of texts at such lengths if I could read his entire body of work and claim it to be

14:31.120 --> 14:36.400
a story about bunny rabbits with the same degree of authority. Post-modernism in the academy,

14:36.400 --> 14:41.520
this is of course not the only criticism commonly made of post-modernism. The most glaring problem

14:41.520 --> 14:46.000
of epistemic cultural relativism has been addressed by philosophers and scientists.

14:46.080 --> 14:49.920
The philosopher David Detmer in Challenging Post-Modernism says,

14:49.920 --> 14:55.760
Consider this example provided by Erezim Kohak. When I try unsuccessfully to squeeze a tennis

14:55.760 --> 15:00.960
ball into a wine bottle, I need not try several wine bottles and several tennis balls before,

15:00.960 --> 15:05.920
using Mills' Cannons of Induction. I arrive inductively at the hypothesis that tennis balls

15:05.920 --> 15:11.040
do not fit into wine bottles. We are now in a position to turn the tables on post-modernist

15:11.040 --> 15:16.800
claims of cultural relativism and ask, If I judge the tennis balls do not fit into wine bottles,

15:16.800 --> 15:21.600
can you show precisely how it is that my gender, historical and spatial location,

15:21.600 --> 15:27.280
class, ethnicity, etc. undermine the objectivity of this judgment? However, he has not found

15:27.280 --> 15:32.080
post-modernists committed to explaining their reasoning and describes a bewildering conversation

15:32.080 --> 15:37.280
with post-modern philosopher Laurie Calhoun. When I had occasion to ask her whether or not

15:37.280 --> 15:41.840
it was a fact that giraffes are taller than ants, she replied that it was not a fact,

15:41.840 --> 15:47.760
but rather an article of religious faith in our culture. Physicist Alan Sokolot and Jean-Brigment

15:47.760 --> 15:52.880
addressed the same problem from the perspective of science in fashionable nonsense, post-modern

15:52.880 --> 15:59.200
intellectuals abuse of science. Who could now seriously deny the grand narrative of evolution,

15:59.200 --> 16:04.080
except someone in the grip of a far less plausible master narrative such as creationism,

16:04.080 --> 16:09.680
and who would wish to deny the truth of basic physics? The answer was some post-modernists,

16:09.680 --> 16:15.120
and quote, There is something very odd indeed in the belief that in looking, say, for causal laws

16:15.120 --> 16:20.160
or a unified theory or in asking whether atoms really do obey the laws of quantum mechanics,

16:20.160 --> 16:26.240
the activities of scientists are somehow inherently bourgeois or Eurocentric or masculinist or even

16:26.240 --> 16:31.680
militarist. How much of a threat is post-modernism to science? There are certainly some external

16:31.680 --> 16:37.680
attacks. In the 2017 protests against a talk given by Charles Murray at Middlebury, the protesters

16:37.680 --> 16:44.640
chanted as one, quote, Science has always been used to legitimize racism, sexism, classism,

16:44.640 --> 16:50.640
transphobia, ableism and homophobia, all veiled as rational and fact and supported by the government

16:50.640 --> 16:56.000
and state. In this world today, there is little that is true fact. When the organizers of the

16:56.000 --> 17:02.880
March for Science tweeted, colonization, racism, immigration, native rights, sexism, ableism,

17:02.880 --> 17:09.040
queer, trans, intersexphobia and econ justice are scientific issues. Many scientists immediately

17:09.040 --> 17:14.480
criticizes politicization of science and derailment of the focus on preservation of science to

17:14.480 --> 17:20.480
intersectional ideology. In South Africa, the hashtag science must fall and hashtag decolonize

17:20.480 --> 17:25.280
science, progressive student movement announced that science was only one way of knowing that

17:25.280 --> 17:30.720
people have been taught to accept. They suggested witchcraft as one alternative. Despite this,

17:30.720 --> 17:36.400
science as a methodology is not going anywhere. It cannot be adapted to include epistemic

17:36.400 --> 17:42.320
relativism and alternative ways of knowing. It can, however, lose public confidence and thereby

17:42.320 --> 17:47.920
state funding and this is a threat not to be underestimated. Also, at a time in which world

17:47.920 --> 17:53.600
rulers doubt climate change, parents believe false claims that vaccines cause autism and people turn

17:53.600 --> 17:58.800
to homopaths and naturopaths for solutions to serious medical conditions. It is dangerous to

17:58.800 --> 18:03.440
the degree of an existential threat to further damage people's confidence in the empirical

18:03.440 --> 18:08.480
sciences. The social sciences and humanities, however, are in danger of changing out of all

18:08.480 --> 18:13.680
recognition. Some disciplines within the social sciences already have, cultural anthropology,

18:13.680 --> 18:18.960
sociology, cultural studies and gender studies, for example, have succumbed almost entirely not

18:18.960 --> 18:24.320
only to moral relativism but epistemic relativism. English literature too, in my experience, is

18:24.320 --> 18:29.680
teaching a thoroughly postmodern orthodoxy. Philosophy, as we have seen, is divided. So is

18:29.680 --> 18:34.640
history. Empirical historians are often criticized by the postmodernists among us for claiming to

18:34.640 --> 18:39.920
know what really happened in the past. Christopher Butler recalls Diane Perkus' accusation that

18:39.920 --> 18:45.120
Keith Thomas was enabling a myth that grounded men's historical identity in the powerlessness

18:45.120 --> 18:50.160
and speechlessness of women when he provided evidence that accused witches were usually powerless

18:50.160 --> 18:54.880
beggar women. Resumably, he should have claimed against the evidence that they were wealthy women

18:54.880 --> 19:00.720
or better still, men. As Butler says, it seems as though Thomas' empirical claims here simply run

19:00.720 --> 19:06.160
foul of Perkus' rival organizing principle for historical narrative that it should be used to

19:06.160 --> 19:11.360
support contemporary notions of female empowerment. I account to the same problem when trying to write

19:11.360 --> 19:16.320
about race and gender at the turn of the 17th century. I'd argue that Shakespeare's audiences

19:16.320 --> 19:21.280
would not have found Desdemona's attraction to Black Othello, who is Christian and a soldier for

19:21.280 --> 19:25.760
Venice, so difficult to understand. Because prejudice against skin colour did not become

19:25.760 --> 19:30.480
prevalent until little later in the 17th century, when the Atlantic slave trade gained steam,

19:30.480 --> 19:35.360
and that religious and national differences were far more profound before that. I was told this was

19:35.360 --> 19:40.160
problematic by an eminent professor and asked how Black communities in contemporary America would

19:40.160 --> 19:45.680
feel about my claim. If today's African Americans felt badly about it, it was implied it either could

19:45.680 --> 19:50.960
not have been true in the 17th century or it is morally wrong to mention it. As Christopher Butler

19:50.960 --> 19:56.080
says, postmodernist thought sees the culture as containing a number of perpetually competing

19:56.080 --> 20:01.520
stories whose effectiveness depends not so much on an appeal to an independent standard of judgment,

20:01.520 --> 20:06.560
as upon their appeal to the communities in which they circulate. I fear for the future of the

20:06.560 --> 20:12.560
humanities. Postmodernism beyond the Academy. The dangers of postmodernism are not limited to

20:12.560 --> 20:18.000
pockets of society which center on academia and social justice, however. Relativist ideas,

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
sensitivity to language, and focus on identity over humanity or individuality have gained dominance

20:24.000 --> 20:29.600
in wider society. It is much easier to say what you feel than rigorously examine the evidence.

20:29.600 --> 20:34.960
The freedom to interpret reality according to one's own values feeds into the very human tendency

20:34.960 --> 20:40.080
towards confirmation bias and motivated reasoning. It has become commonplace to note that the far

20:40.080 --> 20:45.680
right is now using identity politics and epistemic relativism in a very similar way to the postmodern

20:45.680 --> 20:50.560
left. Of course, elements of the far right have always been divisive on the grounds of race,

20:50.560 --> 20:55.840
gender, and sexuality, and prone to irrational and anti-science views. But postmodernism has

20:55.840 --> 21:00.640
produced a culture more widely receptive to this. Kenan Malik describes this shift, quote,

21:00.640 --> 21:05.360
when I suggested earlier that the idea of alternative facts draws upon, quote,

21:05.360 --> 21:10.000
a set of concepts that in recent decades have been used by radicals. I was not suggesting

21:10.000 --> 21:14.800
that Kellyanne Conway or Steve Bannon, still less Donald Trump, have been reading up on Foucault

21:14.800 --> 21:20.160
or Baudrillard. It is rather that sections of academia on the left have in recent decades helped

21:20.160 --> 21:25.600
create a culture in which relativized views, effects, and knowledge seem untroubling and hence

21:25.680 --> 21:31.200
made it easier for the reaction right not just to reappropriate but also to promote reactionary

21:31.200 --> 21:36.320
ideas. This set of concepts threatens to take us back to a time before the Enlightenment when

21:36.320 --> 21:42.400
reason was regarded as not only inferior to faith but as a sin. James K. A. Smith, Reformed Theologian

21:42.400 --> 21:47.280
and Professor of Philosophy, has been quick to see the advantages for Christianity and regards

21:47.280 --> 21:52.640
postmodernism as, quote, a fresh wind of the spirit sent to revitalize the dry bones of the

21:52.640 --> 21:58.720
church. In Who's Afraid of Postmodernism, taking Derrida, Leotard, and Foucault to church, he says,

21:58.720 --> 22:03.680
a thoughtful engagement with postmodernism will encourage us to look backward. We will see that

22:03.680 --> 22:08.640
much that goes under the banner of postmodern philosophy has one eye on ancient and medieval

22:08.640 --> 22:15.200
sources and constitutes a significant recovery of pre-modern ways of knowing, being, and doing.

22:15.200 --> 22:20.640
And postmodernism can be a catalyst for the church to reclaim its faith, not as a system of truth

22:20.640 --> 22:27.440
dictated by mutual reason, but rather as a story that requires eyes to see and ears to hear. We on

22:27.440 --> 22:32.560
the left should be very afraid of what our side has produced. Of course, not every problem in

22:32.560 --> 22:37.840
society today is the fault of postmodern thinking and it is not helpful to suggest that it is.

22:37.840 --> 22:42.800
The rise of populism and nationalism in the US and across Europe are also due to a strong

22:42.800 --> 22:48.320
existing far right and the fear of Islamism produced by the refugee crisis. Taking a rigidly

22:48.320 --> 22:54.240
anti-SJW stance and blaming everything on this element of the left is itself rife with motivated

22:54.240 --> 22:58.960
reasoning and confirmation bias. The left is not responsible for the far right or the religious

22:58.960 --> 23:04.480
right or secular nationalism, but it is responsible for not engaging with reasonable concerns reasonably

23:04.480 --> 23:09.920
and thereby making itself harder for reasonable people to support. It is responsible for its own

23:09.920 --> 23:16.160
fragmentation, purity demands, and divisiveness, which make even the far right appear comparatively

23:16.160 --> 23:22.000
coherent and cohesive. In order to regain credibility, the left needs to recover a strong,

23:22.000 --> 23:27.200
coherent, and reasonable liberalism. To do this, we need to out-discourse the postmodern left.

23:27.200 --> 23:31.680
We need to meet their oppositions, divisions, and hierarchies with universal principles of

23:31.680 --> 23:36.960
freedom, equality, and justice. There must be a consistency of liberal principles in opposition

23:36.960 --> 23:42.480
to all attempts to evaluate or limit people by race, gender, or sexuality. We must address

23:42.480 --> 23:47.680
concerns about immigration, globalism, and authoritarian identity politics, currently

23:47.680 --> 23:53.520
empowering the far right, rather than calling people who express them racist, sexist, or homophobic,

23:53.520 --> 23:58.160
and accusing them of wanting to commit verbal violence. We can do this whilst continuing to

23:58.160 --> 24:03.280
oppose authoritarian factions the right, who genuinely are racist, sexist, and homophobic,

24:03.280 --> 24:08.240
but can now hide behind a facade of reasonable opposition to the postmodern left. Our current

24:08.240 --> 24:14.480
crisis is not one of left versus right, but of consistency, reason, humility, and universal

24:14.480 --> 24:20.480
liberalism versus inconsistency, irrationalism, zealous certainty, and tribal authoritarianism.

24:20.480 --> 24:25.040
The future of freedom, equality, and justice looks equally bleak, whether the postmodern left

24:25.040 --> 24:30.080
or the post-truth right wins this current war. Those of us who value liberal democracy and the

24:30.080 --> 24:35.200
fruits of the Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution and modernity itself must provide

24:35.200 --> 24:38.480
a better option. Thank you for listening.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.480
you
