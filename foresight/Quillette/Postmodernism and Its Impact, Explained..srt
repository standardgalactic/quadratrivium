1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Postmodernism presents a threat not only to liberal democracy, but to modernity itself.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,040
That may sound like a bold or even a hyperbolic claim, but the reality is that the cluster of

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,480
ideas and values at the root of postmodernism have broken the bounds of academia and gained great

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,320
cultural power in western society. The irrational and identitarian symptoms of postmodernism

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,400
are easily recognizable and much criticized, but the ethos underlying them is not well understood.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,360
This is partly because postmodernists rarely explain themselves clearly and partly because

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,400
of the inherent contradictions and inconsistencies of a way of thought that denies that a stable

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,800
reality or reliable knowledge exists. However, there are consistent ideas at the root of postmodernism

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,600
and understanding them is essential if we intend to counter them. They underlie the problems we

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,640
see today in social justice activism, undermine the credibility of the left and threaten to return

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,320
us to an irrational and tribal pre-modern culture. Postmodernism, most simply, is an artistic and

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,160
philosophical movement which began in France in the 1960s and produced bewildering art and even

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,840
more bewildering theory. It drew on avant-garde and surrealist art and earlier philosophical ideas,

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,640
particularly those of Nietzsche and Heidegger, for its anti-realism and rejection of the concept of

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,520
the unified and coherent individual. It reacted against the liberal humanism of modernist,

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,440
artistic and intellectual movements which its proponents saw as naively universalizing a western,

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,040
middle class and male experience. It rejected philosophy which valued ethics, reason and

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,880
clarity with the same accusation. Structuralism, a movement which, often over confidently,

19
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,240
attempted to analyze human culture and psychology according to consistent structures of relationships,

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,680
came under attack. Marxism, with its understanding of society through class and economic structures,

21
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,280
was regarded as equally rigid and simplistic. Above all, postmodernists attacked science and

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,400
its goal of obtaining objective knowledge about a reality that exists independently of human

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,320
perceptions, which they saw as merely another form of constructed ideology dominated by bourgeois

24
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,240
western assumptions. Decidedly left wing, postmodernism had both a nihilistic and a revolutionary

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,640
ethos which resonated with a post-war post-empire zeitgeist in the west, as postmodernism continued

26
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,240
to develop and diversify, its initially stronger nihilistic deconstructive phase became secondary,

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,280
but still fundamental to its revolutionary identity politics phase. It has been a matter

28
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,480
of contention whether postmodernism is a reaction against modernity. The modern era is the period

29
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,120
of history which saw Renaissance humanism, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution and

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,080
the development of liberal values and human rights. The period when western societies gradually came

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,200
to value reason and science over faith and superstition as roots to knowledge and developed a

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,640
concept of the person as an individual member of the human race deserving of rights and freedoms

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,600
rather than as part of various collectives subject to rigid hierarchical roles in society.

34
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,800
The Encyclopedia Britannica says postmodernism, quote, is largely a reaction against the

35
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,440
philosophical assumptions and values of the modern period of western, specifically European

36
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,920
history. Whilst the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy denies this and says,

37
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,880
rather its differences lie within modernity itself, and postmodernism is a continuation

38
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,080
of modern thinking in another mode. I'd suggest that the difference lies in whether we see modernity

39
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,920
in terms of what was produced or what was destroyed. If we see the essence of modernity as the development

40
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,040
of science and reason, as well as humanism and universal liberalism, postmodernists are opposed

41
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,760
to it. If we see modernity as the tearing down of structures of power, including feudalism,

42
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,960
the church, patriarchy and empire, postmodernists are attempting to continue it, but their targets

43
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,480
are now science, reason, humanism and liberalism. Consequently, the roots of postmodernism are

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,200
inherently political and revolutionary, albeit in a destructive, or as they would term it,

45
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,920
deconstructive, way. Jean-François Lyotard

46
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:07,280
The term postmodern was coined by Jean-François Lyotard in his 1979 book The Postmodern Condition.

47
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,120
He defined the postmodern condition as, quote, an incredulity towards meta-narratives.

48
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,800
A meta-narrative is a wide-ranging and cohesive explanation for large phenomena. Religions and

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,320
other totalizing ideologies are meta-narratives in their attempts to explain the meaning of life

50
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,360
or all of society's ills. Lyotard advocated replacing these with, quote, mini-narratives,

51
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,800
to get at smaller and more personal truths. He addressed Christianity and Marxism in this way,

52
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,720
but also science. In his view, quote, there is a strict interlinkage between the kind of language

53
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,160
called science and the kind called ethics and politics. By telling science the knowledge it

54
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,920
produces to government and power, he rejects its claim to objectivity. Lyotard describes this

55
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,960
incredulous postmodern condition as a general one and argues that from the end of the 19th century,

56
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,000
quote, an internal erosion of the legitimacy principle of knowledge began to cause a change

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,760
in the status of knowledge. By the 1960s, the resulting doubt and demoralization of scientists

58
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,920
in Lyotard's words, had, quote, made an impact on the central problem of legitimization. No

59
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,800
number of scientists telling him they are not demoralized nor any more doubtful than befits

60
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,520
the practitioner's own method whose results are always provisional and whose hypotheses are never

61
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,840
proven could sway him from this. We see in Lyotard an explicit epistemic relativism,

62
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,440
belief in personal or culturally specific truths or facts, and the advocacy of privileging, quote,

63
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,360
lived experience over empirical evidence. We see, too, the promotion of a version of pluralism

64
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,480
that privileges the views of minority groups over the general consensus of scientists or liberal

65
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,920
democratic ethics, which are presented as authoritarian and dogmatic. This is consistent

66
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,680
in postmodern thought. Michel Foucault. Michel Foucault's work is also centered on language

67
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,440
and relativism, although he applied this to history and culture. We call this approach archaeology

68
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,480
because he saw himself as, quote, uncovering aspects of historical culture through recorded

69
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,720
discourses, speech that promotes or assumes a particular view. For Foucault, discourses control

70
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,840
what can be known, and in different periods and places, different systems of institutional power

71
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,440
control discourses. Therefore, knowledge is a direct product of power, quote. In any given

72
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,120
culture and at any given moment, there is always only one episteme that defines the conditions

73
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,640
of possibility of all knowledge, whether expressed in theory or silently invested in a practice.

74
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,520
Furthermore, people themselves were culturally constructed, quote. The individual with his

75
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,640
identity and characteristics is the product of a relation of power exercised over bodies,

76
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,960
multiplicities, movements, desires, forces. He leaves almost no room for individual agency

77
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,400
or autonomy. As Christopher Butler says, Foucault, quote, relies on beliefs about the inherent evil

78
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,920
of the individual's class position or professional position seen as discourse, regardless of the

79
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,360
morality of his or her individual conduct. He presents medieval feudalism and modern liberal

80
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,880
democracies equally oppressive and advocates criticizing and attacking institutions to unmask

81
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,240
the, quote, political violence that has always exercised itself obscurely through them. We see

82
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,840
in Foucault the most extreme expression of cultural relativism, read through structures of power in which

83
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,360
shared humanity and individuality are almost entirely absent. Instead, people are constructed

84
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,040
by their position in relation to dominant cultural ideas, either as oppressors or oppressed. Judith

85
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,680
Butler drew on Foucault for her foundational role in queer theory, focusing on the culturally

86
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,480
constructed nature of gender, as did Edward Said in his similar role in postcolonialism

87
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,040
and orientalism, and Kimberly Crenshaw in her development of intersectionality and

88
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,640
advocacy of identity politics. We see, too, the equation of language with violence and coercion

89
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:04,560
and the equation of reason and universal liberalism with oppression. Jacques Derrida. It was Jacques

90
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,640
Derrida who introduced the concept of deconstruction, and he, too, argued for cultural constructivism

91
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,680
and cultural and personal relativism. He focuses even more explicitly on language.

92
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,360
Derrida's best-known pronouncement, there is no outside text, relates to his rejection of the

93
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,520
idea that words refer to anything straightforwardly. Rather, quote, there are only contexts without any

94
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,880
center of absolute anchoring. Therefore, the author of a text is not the authority on its meaning.

95
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,160
The reader or listener makes their own equally valid meaning, and every text, quote, engenders

96
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,080
infinitely new contexts in an absolutely non-saturable fashion. Derrida coined the

97
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,000
term Difference, which he derived from the verb Differer, which means both to defer and to differ.

98
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,280
This was to indicate that not only is meaning never final, but it is constructed by differences,

99
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,200
specifically by oppositions. The word young only makes sense in its relation with the word old,

100
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,320
and he argued, following so-soor, that meaning is constructed by the conflict of these elemental

101
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,320
oppositions, which to him always form a positive and negative. Man is positive, and woman negative.

102
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,160
Occident is positive, and Orient negative. He insisted that we are not dealing with a peaceful

103
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,400
coexistence with visa v, but rather with a violent hierarchy. One of the two terms governs the other,

104
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,880
axiologically, logically, etc., or has the upper hand. To deconstruct the opposition, first of all,

105
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,320
is to overturn the hierarchy at a given moment. Deconstruction, therefore, involves inverting

106
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,640
these perceived hierarchies, making woman and Orient positive, and man and Occident negative.

107
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,280
This is to be done ironically, to reveal the culturally constructed and arbitrary nature

108
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,640
of these perceived oppositions in unequal conflict. We see in Derrida further relativism,

109
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,120
both cultural and epistemic, and further justification for identity politics.

110
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,760
There is an explicit denial that differences can be other than oppositional, and therefore a

111
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,960
rejection of Enlightenment liberalism's values of overcoming differences, and focusing on universal

112
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,440
human rights and individual freedom and empowerment. We see here the basis of quote,

113
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,440
ironic misundry, and the mantra, reverse racism isn't real, and the idea that identity dictates

114
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,800
what can be understood. We see too a rejection of the need for clarity in speech and argument,

115
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,400
and to understand the other's point of view and avoid misinterpretation.

116
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,120
The intention of the speaker is irrelevant. What matters is the impact of speech. This,

117
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,000
along with Foucaultian ideas, underlies the current belief in the deeply damaging nature of

118
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,280
microaggressions, and misuse of terminology related to gender, race, or sexuality.

119
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,000
Lyotard, Foucault, and Derrida are just three of the founding fathers of post-modernism,

120
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,120
but their ideas share common themes with other influential theorists, and will taken up later

121
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,280
by post-modernists who apply them to an increasingly diverse range of disciplines

122
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,600
within the social sciences and humanities. We've seen that this includes an intense

123
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,560
sensitivity to language on the level of the word, and a feeling that what the speaker means is less

124
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,920
important than how it is received, no matter how radical the interpretation. Shared humanity and

125
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,280
individuality are essentially illusions, and people are propagators or victims of discourses

126
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,080
depending on their social position, a position that is dependent on identity, far more than on

127
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,920
their individual engagement with society. Morality is culturally relative, as is reality itself.

128
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,200
Empirical evidence is suspect, and so are any culturally dominant ideas, including science,

129
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,480
reason, and universal liberalism. Far more important are the lived experience, narratives,

130
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,760
and beliefs of marginalised groups, all of which are equally quote-unquote true, but must now be

131
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,880
privileged over enlightenment values, to reverse an oppressive, unjust, and entirely arbitrary

132
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,320
social construction of reality, morality, and knowledge. The desire to smash the status quo,

133
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,200
challenge widely held values in institutions, and champion the marginalised is absolutely

134
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,800
liberal in ethos. Opposing it is resolutely conservative. This is the historical reality.

135
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,160
But we are at a unique point in history, where the status quo is fairly consistently liberal,

136
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,720
with a liberalism that upholds the values of freedom, equal rights, and opportunities for

137
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,560
everyone, regardless of gender, race, or sexuality. The result is confusion, in which lifelong liberals

138
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,280
wishing to conserve this kind of liberal status quo, find themselves considered conservative,

139
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,560
and those wishing to avoid conservatism at all costs, find themselves defending irrationalism

140
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,440
and illiberalism. Whilst the first post-modernists mostly challenge discourse with discourse,

141
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,920
the activists motivated by their ideas are becoming more authoritarian, and following

142
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,160
those ideas to their logical conclusion. Freedom of speech is under threat, because

143
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,280
speech is now dangerous. So dangerous that people considering themselves liberal can now justify

144
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:53,120
responding to it with violence. The need to argue a case persuasively using reasoned argument is now

145
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,720
often replaced with references to identity and pure rage. Despite all the evidence that racism,

146
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,320
sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia are at an all-time low in western societies,

147
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,560
leftist academics and social justice activists display a fatalistic pessimism enabled by post-modern

148
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,080
interpretative reading practices that valorize confirmation bias. The authoritarian power of

149
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,640
the post-modern academics and activists seems to be invisible to them whilst being apparent to

150
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,320
everyone else, as Andrew Sullivan says of intersectionality. It posits a classic orthodoxy,

151
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,640
through which all of human experience is explained, and through which all speech must

152
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:36,400
be filtered. Like the puritanism once familiar in New England, intersectionality controls language

153
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,840
and the very terms of discourse. Post-modernism has become a leotardian metanarrative,

154
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,440
a Foucaudian system of discursive power, and a deridian oppressive hierarchy. The logical problem

155
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,400
of self-referentiality has been pointed out to post-modernists by philosophers fairly constantly,

156
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,880
but it is one they have yet to address convincingly. As Christopher Butler points out,

157
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,000
the plausibility of Leotard's claim for the decline of metanarratives in the late 20th century

158
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,800
ultimately depends upon an appeal to the cultural condition of an intellectual minority. In other

159
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,600
words, Leotard's claim comes directly from the discourses surrounding him in his bourgeois

160
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,360
academic bubble, and is in fact a metanarrative towards which he is not remotely incredulous.

161
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,920
Equally, Foucaud's argument that knowledge is historically contingent must itself be

162
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,400
historically contingent, and one wonders why Derridaugh bothered to explain the infinite

163
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,120
malleability of texts at such lengths if I could read his entire body of work and claim it to be

164
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,400
a story about bunny rabbits with the same degree of authority. Post-modernism in the academy,

165
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,520
this is of course not the only criticism commonly made of post-modernism. The most glaring problem

166
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,000
of epistemic cultural relativism has been addressed by philosophers and scientists.

167
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,920
The philosopher David Detmer in Challenging Post-Modernism says,

168
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,760
Consider this example provided by Erezim Kohak. When I try unsuccessfully to squeeze a tennis

169
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,960
ball into a wine bottle, I need not try several wine bottles and several tennis balls before,

170
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,920
using Mills' Cannons of Induction. I arrive inductively at the hypothesis that tennis balls

171
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,040
do not fit into wine bottles. We are now in a position to turn the tables on post-modernist

172
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,800
claims of cultural relativism and ask, If I judge the tennis balls do not fit into wine bottles,

173
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,600
can you show precisely how it is that my gender, historical and spatial location,

174
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,280
class, ethnicity, etc. undermine the objectivity of this judgment? However, he has not found

175
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,080
post-modernists committed to explaining their reasoning and describes a bewildering conversation

176
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,280
with post-modern philosopher Laurie Calhoun. When I had occasion to ask her whether or not

177
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,840
it was a fact that giraffes are taller than ants, she replied that it was not a fact,

178
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,760
but rather an article of religious faith in our culture. Physicist Alan Sokolot and Jean-Brigment

179
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,880
addressed the same problem from the perspective of science in fashionable nonsense, post-modern

180
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,200
intellectuals abuse of science. Who could now seriously deny the grand narrative of evolution,

181
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,080
except someone in the grip of a far less plausible master narrative such as creationism,

182
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,680
and who would wish to deny the truth of basic physics? The answer was some post-modernists,

183
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,120
and quote, There is something very odd indeed in the belief that in looking, say, for causal laws

184
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,160
or a unified theory or in asking whether atoms really do obey the laws of quantum mechanics,

185
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,240
the activities of scientists are somehow inherently bourgeois or Eurocentric or masculinist or even

186
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,680
militarist. How much of a threat is post-modernism to science? There are certainly some external

187
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,680
attacks. In the 2017 protests against a talk given by Charles Murray at Middlebury, the protesters

188
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,640
chanted as one, quote, Science has always been used to legitimize racism, sexism, classism,

189
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,640
transphobia, ableism and homophobia, all veiled as rational and fact and supported by the government

190
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,000
and state. In this world today, there is little that is true fact. When the organizers of the

191
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,880
March for Science tweeted, colonization, racism, immigration, native rights, sexism, ableism,

192
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,040
queer, trans, intersexphobia and econ justice are scientific issues. Many scientists immediately

193
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,480
criticizes politicization of science and derailment of the focus on preservation of science to

194
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,480
intersectional ideology. In South Africa, the hashtag science must fall and hashtag decolonize

195
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,280
science, progressive student movement announced that science was only one way of knowing that

196
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,720
people have been taught to accept. They suggested witchcraft as one alternative. Despite this,

197
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,400
science as a methodology is not going anywhere. It cannot be adapted to include epistemic

198
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,320
relativism and alternative ways of knowing. It can, however, lose public confidence and thereby

199
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,920
state funding and this is a threat not to be underestimated. Also, at a time in which world

200
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,600
rulers doubt climate change, parents believe false claims that vaccines cause autism and people turn

201
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,800
to homopaths and naturopaths for solutions to serious medical conditions. It is dangerous to

202
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,440
the degree of an existential threat to further damage people's confidence in the empirical

203
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,480
sciences. The social sciences and humanities, however, are in danger of changing out of all

204
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,680
recognition. Some disciplines within the social sciences already have, cultural anthropology,

205
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,960
sociology, cultural studies and gender studies, for example, have succumbed almost entirely not

206
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,320
only to moral relativism but epistemic relativism. English literature too, in my experience, is

207
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,680
teaching a thoroughly postmodern orthodoxy. Philosophy, as we have seen, is divided. So is

208
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,640
history. Empirical historians are often criticized by the postmodernists among us for claiming to

209
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,920
know what really happened in the past. Christopher Butler recalls Diane Perkus' accusation that

210
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,120
Keith Thomas was enabling a myth that grounded men's historical identity in the powerlessness

211
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,160
and speechlessness of women when he provided evidence that accused witches were usually powerless

212
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,880
beggar women. Resumably, he should have claimed against the evidence that they were wealthy women

213
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,720
or better still, men. As Butler says, it seems as though Thomas' empirical claims here simply run

214
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,160
foul of Perkus' rival organizing principle for historical narrative that it should be used to

215
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,360
support contemporary notions of female empowerment. I account to the same problem when trying to write

216
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,320
about race and gender at the turn of the 17th century. I'd argue that Shakespeare's audiences

217
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,280
would not have found Desdemona's attraction to Black Othello, who is Christian and a soldier for

218
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,760
Venice, so difficult to understand. Because prejudice against skin colour did not become

219
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,480
prevalent until little later in the 17th century, when the Atlantic slave trade gained steam,

220
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,360
and that religious and national differences were far more profound before that. I was told this was

221
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,160
problematic by an eminent professor and asked how Black communities in contemporary America would

222
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,680
feel about my claim. If today's African Americans felt badly about it, it was implied it either could

223
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,960
not have been true in the 17th century or it is morally wrong to mention it. As Christopher Butler

224
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,080
says, postmodernist thought sees the culture as containing a number of perpetually competing

225
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,520
stories whose effectiveness depends not so much on an appeal to an independent standard of judgment,

226
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,560
as upon their appeal to the communities in which they circulate. I fear for the future of the

227
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:12,560
humanities. Postmodernism beyond the Academy. The dangers of postmodernism are not limited to

228
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,000
pockets of society which center on academia and social justice, however. Relativist ideas,

229
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
sensitivity to language, and focus on identity over humanity or individuality have gained dominance

230
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,600
in wider society. It is much easier to say what you feel than rigorously examine the evidence.

231
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,960
The freedom to interpret reality according to one's own values feeds into the very human tendency

232
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,080
towards confirmation bias and motivated reasoning. It has become commonplace to note that the far

233
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,680
right is now using identity politics and epistemic relativism in a very similar way to the postmodern

234
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,560
left. Of course, elements of the far right have always been divisive on the grounds of race,

235
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,840
gender, and sexuality, and prone to irrational and anti-science views. But postmodernism has

236
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,640
produced a culture more widely receptive to this. Kenan Malik describes this shift, quote,

237
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,360
when I suggested earlier that the idea of alternative facts draws upon, quote,

238
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,000
a set of concepts that in recent decades have been used by radicals. I was not suggesting

239
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,800
that Kellyanne Conway or Steve Bannon, still less Donald Trump, have been reading up on Foucault

240
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:20,160
or Baudrillard. It is rather that sections of academia on the left have in recent decades helped

241
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,600
create a culture in which relativized views, effects, and knowledge seem untroubling and hence

242
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,200
made it easier for the reaction right not just to reappropriate but also to promote reactionary

243
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,320
ideas. This set of concepts threatens to take us back to a time before the Enlightenment when

244
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,400
reason was regarded as not only inferior to faith but as a sin. James K. A. Smith, Reformed Theologian

245
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,280
and Professor of Philosophy, has been quick to see the advantages for Christianity and regards

246
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,640
postmodernism as, quote, a fresh wind of the spirit sent to revitalize the dry bones of the

247
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,720
church. In Who's Afraid of Postmodernism, taking Derrida, Leotard, and Foucault to church, he says,

248
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,680
a thoughtful engagement with postmodernism will encourage us to look backward. We will see that

249
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,640
much that goes under the banner of postmodern philosophy has one eye on ancient and medieval

250
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:15,200
sources and constitutes a significant recovery of pre-modern ways of knowing, being, and doing.

251
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,640
And postmodernism can be a catalyst for the church to reclaim its faith, not as a system of truth

252
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,440
dictated by mutual reason, but rather as a story that requires eyes to see and ears to hear. We on

253
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,560
the left should be very afraid of what our side has produced. Of course, not every problem in

254
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,840
society today is the fault of postmodern thinking and it is not helpful to suggest that it is.

255
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,800
The rise of populism and nationalism in the US and across Europe are also due to a strong

256
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:48,320
existing far right and the fear of Islamism produced by the refugee crisis. Taking a rigidly

257
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,240
anti-SJW stance and blaming everything on this element of the left is itself rife with motivated

258
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,960
reasoning and confirmation bias. The left is not responsible for the far right or the religious

259
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,480
right or secular nationalism, but it is responsible for not engaging with reasonable concerns reasonably

260
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,920
and thereby making itself harder for reasonable people to support. It is responsible for its own

261
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:16,160
fragmentation, purity demands, and divisiveness, which make even the far right appear comparatively

262
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,000
coherent and cohesive. In order to regain credibility, the left needs to recover a strong,

263
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,200
coherent, and reasonable liberalism. To do this, we need to out-discourse the postmodern left.

264
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,680
We need to meet their oppositions, divisions, and hierarchies with universal principles of

265
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,960
freedom, equality, and justice. There must be a consistency of liberal principles in opposition

266
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,480
to all attempts to evaluate or limit people by race, gender, or sexuality. We must address

267
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,680
concerns about immigration, globalism, and authoritarian identity politics, currently

268
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:53,520
empowering the far right, rather than calling people who express them racist, sexist, or homophobic,

269
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,160
and accusing them of wanting to commit verbal violence. We can do this whilst continuing to

270
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,280
oppose authoritarian factions the right, who genuinely are racist, sexist, and homophobic,

271
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,240
but can now hide behind a facade of reasonable opposition to the postmodern left. Our current

272
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,480
crisis is not one of left versus right, but of consistency, reason, humility, and universal

273
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,480
liberalism versus inconsistency, irrationalism, zealous certainty, and tribal authoritarianism.

274
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,040
The future of freedom, equality, and justice looks equally bleak, whether the postmodern left

275
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,080
or the post-truth right wins this current war. Those of us who value liberal democracy and the

276
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,200
fruits of the Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution and modernity itself must provide

277
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,480
a better option. Thank you for listening.

278
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,480
you
