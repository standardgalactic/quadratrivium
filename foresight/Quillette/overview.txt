Checking Quillette/Postmodernism and Its Impact, Explained..txt
 The discussion revolves around the phenomenon of confirmation bias and motivated reasoning, particularly in the context of political ideologies. It notes that both the far right and certain elements on the postmodern left have begun to adopt similar tactics in terms of identity politics and epistemic relativism. While the far right has historically been divisive on issues of race, gender, and sexuality, the postmodern left's embrace of relativized views and knowledge has created a cultural landscape where such reactionary ideas can be more easily promoted.

The concern is that the left's engagement with postmodernism has undermined the Enlightenment values of reason and has made it more difficult for the left to present a coherent, reasonable, and universally appealing narrative. This has allowed the far right to fill the void with narratives that, while potentially using anti-science and divisive rhetoric, resonate with those who feel disenfranchised by the left's current approach.

To counter this trend, the speaker argues that the left should reclaim a strong, coherent, and reasonable liberalism. This involves out-discoursing the postmodern left by upholding universal principles of freedom, equality, and justice, addressing legitimate concerns about issues like immigration and globalization without resorting to name-calling or accusations of bigotry, and opposing all forms of authoritarianism, including those from both the right and the left.

The call to action is for a revival of liberal principles that can provide a better option than the current trajectory of polarization, which seems to be leading towards a future where neither the postmodern left nor the post-truth right upholds the values of freedom, equality, and justice effectively. The speaker emphasizes the importance of consistency, reason, humility, and universal liberalism as the path forward for those who value liberal democracy and the achievements of the Enlightenment.
