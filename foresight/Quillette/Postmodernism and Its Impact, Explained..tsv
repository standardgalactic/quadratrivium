0	5920	Postmodernism presents a threat not only to liberal democracy, but to modernity itself.
5920	11040	That may sound like a bold or even a hyperbolic claim, but the reality is that the cluster of
11040	16480	ideas and values at the root of postmodernism have broken the bounds of academia and gained great
16480	22320	cultural power in western society. The irrational and identitarian symptoms of postmodernism
22320	28400	are easily recognizable and much criticized, but the ethos underlying them is not well understood.
28480	33360	This is partly because postmodernists rarely explain themselves clearly and partly because
33360	38400	of the inherent contradictions and inconsistencies of a way of thought that denies that a stable
38400	44800	reality or reliable knowledge exists. However, there are consistent ideas at the root of postmodernism
44800	49600	and understanding them is essential if we intend to counter them. They underlie the problems we
49600	54640	see today in social justice activism, undermine the credibility of the left and threaten to return
54640	60320	us to an irrational and tribal pre-modern culture. Postmodernism, most simply, is an artistic and
60320	66160	philosophical movement which began in France in the 1960s and produced bewildering art and even
66160	71840	more bewildering theory. It drew on avant-garde and surrealist art and earlier philosophical ideas,
71840	76640	particularly those of Nietzsche and Heidegger, for its anti-realism and rejection of the concept of
76640	81520	the unified and coherent individual. It reacted against the liberal humanism of modernist,
81600	87440	artistic and intellectual movements which its proponents saw as naively universalizing a western,
87440	93040	middle class and male experience. It rejected philosophy which valued ethics, reason and
93040	98880	clarity with the same accusation. Structuralism, a movement which, often over confidently,
98880	104240	attempted to analyze human culture and psychology according to consistent structures of relationships,
104240	109680	came under attack. Marxism, with its understanding of society through class and economic structures,
109680	115280	was regarded as equally rigid and simplistic. Above all, postmodernists attacked science and
115280	120400	its goal of obtaining objective knowledge about a reality that exists independently of human
120400	126320	perceptions, which they saw as merely another form of constructed ideology dominated by bourgeois
126320	132240	western assumptions. Decidedly left wing, postmodernism had both a nihilistic and a revolutionary
132240	138640	ethos which resonated with a post-war post-empire zeitgeist in the west, as postmodernism continued
138720	144240	to develop and diversify, its initially stronger nihilistic deconstructive phase became secondary,
144240	149280	but still fundamental to its revolutionary identity politics phase. It has been a matter
149280	154480	of contention whether postmodernism is a reaction against modernity. The modern era is the period
154480	159120	of history which saw Renaissance humanism, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution and
159120	164080	the development of liberal values and human rights. The period when western societies gradually came
164080	169200	to value reason and science over faith and superstition as roots to knowledge and developed a
169200	174640	concept of the person as an individual member of the human race deserving of rights and freedoms
174640	179600	rather than as part of various collectives subject to rigid hierarchical roles in society.
179600	184800	The Encyclopedia Britannica says postmodernism, quote, is largely a reaction against the
184800	189440	philosophical assumptions and values of the modern period of western, specifically European
189920	193920	history. Whilst the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy denies this and says,
193920	198880	rather its differences lie within modernity itself, and postmodernism is a continuation
198880	204080	of modern thinking in another mode. I'd suggest that the difference lies in whether we see modernity
204080	209920	in terms of what was produced or what was destroyed. If we see the essence of modernity as the development
209920	215040	of science and reason, as well as humanism and universal liberalism, postmodernists are opposed
215040	219760	to it. If we see modernity as the tearing down of structures of power, including feudalism,
219760	224960	the church, patriarchy and empire, postmodernists are attempting to continue it, but their targets
224960	230480	are now science, reason, humanism and liberalism. Consequently, the roots of postmodernism are
230480	235200	inherently political and revolutionary, albeit in a destructive, or as they would term it,
235200	239920	deconstructive, way. Jean-François Lyotard
239920	247280	The term postmodern was coined by Jean-François Lyotard in his 1979 book The Postmodern Condition.
247280	253120	He defined the postmodern condition as, quote, an incredulity towards meta-narratives.
253120	258800	A meta-narrative is a wide-ranging and cohesive explanation for large phenomena. Religions and
258800	264320	other totalizing ideologies are meta-narratives in their attempts to explain the meaning of life
264320	271360	or all of society's ills. Lyotard advocated replacing these with, quote, mini-narratives,
271360	276800	to get at smaller and more personal truths. He addressed Christianity and Marxism in this way,
276800	282720	but also science. In his view, quote, there is a strict interlinkage between the kind of language
282720	288160	called science and the kind called ethics and politics. By telling science the knowledge it
288160	293920	produces to government and power, he rejects its claim to objectivity. Lyotard describes this
293920	298960	incredulous postmodern condition as a general one and argues that from the end of the 19th century,
298960	304000	quote, an internal erosion of the legitimacy principle of knowledge began to cause a change
304000	309760	in the status of knowledge. By the 1960s, the resulting doubt and demoralization of scientists
309760	315920	in Lyotard's words, had, quote, made an impact on the central problem of legitimization. No
315920	320800	number of scientists telling him they are not demoralized nor any more doubtful than befits
320800	325520	the practitioner's own method whose results are always provisional and whose hypotheses are never
325520	331840	proven could sway him from this. We see in Lyotard an explicit epistemic relativism,
331840	337440	belief in personal or culturally specific truths or facts, and the advocacy of privileging, quote,
337440	343360	lived experience over empirical evidence. We see, too, the promotion of a version of pluralism
343360	348480	that privileges the views of minority groups over the general consensus of scientists or liberal
348480	353920	democratic ethics, which are presented as authoritarian and dogmatic. This is consistent
353920	359680	in postmodern thought. Michel Foucault. Michel Foucault's work is also centered on language
359680	365440	and relativism, although he applied this to history and culture. We call this approach archaeology
365440	370480	because he saw himself as, quote, uncovering aspects of historical culture through recorded
370480	376720	discourses, speech that promotes or assumes a particular view. For Foucault, discourses control
376720	381840	what can be known, and in different periods and places, different systems of institutional power
381840	387440	control discourses. Therefore, knowledge is a direct product of power, quote. In any given
387440	393120	culture and at any given moment, there is always only one episteme that defines the conditions
393120	398640	of possibility of all knowledge, whether expressed in theory or silently invested in a practice.
398640	403520	Furthermore, people themselves were culturally constructed, quote. The individual with his
403520	408640	identity and characteristics is the product of a relation of power exercised over bodies,
408640	414960	multiplicities, movements, desires, forces. He leaves almost no room for individual agency
414960	420400	or autonomy. As Christopher Butler says, Foucault, quote, relies on beliefs about the inherent evil
420400	425920	of the individual's class position or professional position seen as discourse, regardless of the
425920	431360	morality of his or her individual conduct. He presents medieval feudalism and modern liberal
431360	436880	democracies equally oppressive and advocates criticizing and attacking institutions to unmask
436880	442240	the, quote, political violence that has always exercised itself obscurely through them. We see
442240	447840	in Foucault the most extreme expression of cultural relativism, read through structures of power in which
447840	453360	shared humanity and individuality are almost entirely absent. Instead, people are constructed
453360	459040	by their position in relation to dominant cultural ideas, either as oppressors or oppressed. Judith
459040	463680	Butler drew on Foucault for her foundational role in queer theory, focusing on the culturally
463680	468480	constructed nature of gender, as did Edward Said in his similar role in postcolonialism
468480	473040	and orientalism, and Kimberly Crenshaw in her development of intersectionality and
473040	478640	advocacy of identity politics. We see, too, the equation of language with violence and coercion
478640	484560	and the equation of reason and universal liberalism with oppression. Jacques Derrida. It was Jacques
484560	490640	Derrida who introduced the concept of deconstruction, and he, too, argued for cultural constructivism
490640	495680	and cultural and personal relativism. He focuses even more explicitly on language.
495680	501360	Derrida's best-known pronouncement, there is no outside text, relates to his rejection of the
501360	507520	idea that words refer to anything straightforwardly. Rather, quote, there are only contexts without any
507520	512880	center of absolute anchoring. Therefore, the author of a text is not the authority on its meaning.
512880	518160	The reader or listener makes their own equally valid meaning, and every text, quote, engenders
518160	524080	infinitely new contexts in an absolutely non-saturable fashion. Derrida coined the
524080	530000	term Difference, which he derived from the verb Differer, which means both to defer and to differ.
530000	535280	This was to indicate that not only is meaning never final, but it is constructed by differences,
535280	541200	specifically by oppositions. The word young only makes sense in its relation with the word old,
541200	546320	and he argued, following so-soor, that meaning is constructed by the conflict of these elemental
546320	552320	oppositions, which to him always form a positive and negative. Man is positive, and woman negative.
552320	558160	Occident is positive, and Orient negative. He insisted that we are not dealing with a peaceful
558160	564400	coexistence with visa v, but rather with a violent hierarchy. One of the two terms governs the other,
564400	570880	axiologically, logically, etc., or has the upper hand. To deconstruct the opposition, first of all,
570880	576320	is to overturn the hierarchy at a given moment. Deconstruction, therefore, involves inverting
576320	582640	these perceived hierarchies, making woman and Orient positive, and man and Occident negative.
582640	587280	This is to be done ironically, to reveal the culturally constructed and arbitrary nature
587280	592640	of these perceived oppositions in unequal conflict. We see in Derrida further relativism,
592640	597120	both cultural and epistemic, and further justification for identity politics.
597120	601760	There is an explicit denial that differences can be other than oppositional, and therefore a
601760	606960	rejection of Enlightenment liberalism's values of overcoming differences, and focusing on universal
606960	611440	human rights and individual freedom and empowerment. We see here the basis of quote,
611440	617440	ironic misundry, and the mantra, reverse racism isn't real, and the idea that identity dictates
617440	622800	what can be understood. We see too a rejection of the need for clarity in speech and argument,
622800	626400	and to understand the other's point of view and avoid misinterpretation.
626400	631120	The intention of the speaker is irrelevant. What matters is the impact of speech. This,
631120	636000	along with Foucaultian ideas, underlies the current belief in the deeply damaging nature of
636000	641280	microaggressions, and misuse of terminology related to gender, race, or sexuality.
641280	646000	Lyotard, Foucault, and Derrida are just three of the founding fathers of post-modernism,
646000	651120	but their ideas share common themes with other influential theorists, and will taken up later
651120	655280	by post-modernists who apply them to an increasingly diverse range of disciplines
655280	659600	within the social sciences and humanities. We've seen that this includes an intense
659600	664560	sensitivity to language on the level of the word, and a feeling that what the speaker means is less
664560	669920	important than how it is received, no matter how radical the interpretation. Shared humanity and
669920	675280	individuality are essentially illusions, and people are propagators or victims of discourses
675280	680080	depending on their social position, a position that is dependent on identity, far more than on
680160	685920	their individual engagement with society. Morality is culturally relative, as is reality itself.
685920	691200	Empirical evidence is suspect, and so are any culturally dominant ideas, including science,
691200	696480	reason, and universal liberalism. Far more important are the lived experience, narratives,
696480	701760	and beliefs of marginalised groups, all of which are equally quote-unquote true, but must now be
701760	706880	privileged over enlightenment values, to reverse an oppressive, unjust, and entirely arbitrary
706880	712320	social construction of reality, morality, and knowledge. The desire to smash the status quo,
712320	717200	challenge widely held values in institutions, and champion the marginalised is absolutely
717200	722800	liberal in ethos. Opposing it is resolutely conservative. This is the historical reality.
722800	728160	But we are at a unique point in history, where the status quo is fairly consistently liberal,
728160	732720	with a liberalism that upholds the values of freedom, equal rights, and opportunities for
732720	738560	everyone, regardless of gender, race, or sexuality. The result is confusion, in which lifelong liberals
738560	743280	wishing to conserve this kind of liberal status quo, find themselves considered conservative,
743280	748560	and those wishing to avoid conservatism at all costs, find themselves defending irrationalism
748560	753440	and illiberalism. Whilst the first post-modernists mostly challenge discourse with discourse,
753440	757920	the activists motivated by their ideas are becoming more authoritarian, and following
757920	762160	those ideas to their logical conclusion. Freedom of speech is under threat, because
762160	767280	speech is now dangerous. So dangerous that people considering themselves liberal can now justify
767280	773120	responding to it with violence. The need to argue a case persuasively using reasoned argument is now
773120	778720	often replaced with references to identity and pure rage. Despite all the evidence that racism,
778720	784320	sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia are at an all-time low in western societies,
784320	790560	leftist academics and social justice activists display a fatalistic pessimism enabled by post-modern
790560	796080	interpretative reading practices that valorize confirmation bias. The authoritarian power of
796080	800640	the post-modern academics and activists seems to be invisible to them whilst being apparent to
800640	806320	everyone else, as Andrew Sullivan says of intersectionality. It posits a classic orthodoxy,
806320	810640	through which all of human experience is explained, and through which all speech must
810640	816400	be filtered. Like the puritanism once familiar in New England, intersectionality controls language
816400	821840	and the very terms of discourse. Post-modernism has become a leotardian metanarrative,
821840	827440	a Foucaudian system of discursive power, and a deridian oppressive hierarchy. The logical problem
827440	832400	of self-referentiality has been pointed out to post-modernists by philosophers fairly constantly,
832400	836880	but it is one they have yet to address convincingly. As Christopher Butler points out,
837120	842000	the plausibility of Leotard's claim for the decline of metanarratives in the late 20th century
842000	846800	ultimately depends upon an appeal to the cultural condition of an intellectual minority. In other
846800	851600	words, Leotard's claim comes directly from the discourses surrounding him in his bourgeois
851600	857360	academic bubble, and is in fact a metanarrative towards which he is not remotely incredulous.
857360	861920	Equally, Foucaud's argument that knowledge is historically contingent must itself be
861920	866400	historically contingent, and one wonders why Derridaugh bothered to explain the infinite
866400	871120	malleability of texts at such lengths if I could read his entire body of work and claim it to be
871120	876400	a story about bunny rabbits with the same degree of authority. Post-modernism in the academy,
876400	881520	this is of course not the only criticism commonly made of post-modernism. The most glaring problem
881520	886000	of epistemic cultural relativism has been addressed by philosophers and scientists.
886080	889920	The philosopher David Detmer in Challenging Post-Modernism says,
889920	895760	Consider this example provided by Erezim Kohak. When I try unsuccessfully to squeeze a tennis
895760	900960	ball into a wine bottle, I need not try several wine bottles and several tennis balls before,
900960	905920	using Mills' Cannons of Induction. I arrive inductively at the hypothesis that tennis balls
905920	911040	do not fit into wine bottles. We are now in a position to turn the tables on post-modernist
911040	916800	claims of cultural relativism and ask, If I judge the tennis balls do not fit into wine bottles,
916800	921600	can you show precisely how it is that my gender, historical and spatial location,
921600	927280	class, ethnicity, etc. undermine the objectivity of this judgment? However, he has not found
927280	932080	post-modernists committed to explaining their reasoning and describes a bewildering conversation
932080	937280	with post-modern philosopher Laurie Calhoun. When I had occasion to ask her whether or not
937280	941840	it was a fact that giraffes are taller than ants, she replied that it was not a fact,
941840	947760	but rather an article of religious faith in our culture. Physicist Alan Sokolot and Jean-Brigment
947760	952880	addressed the same problem from the perspective of science in fashionable nonsense, post-modern
952880	959200	intellectuals abuse of science. Who could now seriously deny the grand narrative of evolution,
959200	964080	except someone in the grip of a far less plausible master narrative such as creationism,
964080	969680	and who would wish to deny the truth of basic physics? The answer was some post-modernists,
969680	975120	and quote, There is something very odd indeed in the belief that in looking, say, for causal laws
975120	980160	or a unified theory or in asking whether atoms really do obey the laws of quantum mechanics,
980160	986240	the activities of scientists are somehow inherently bourgeois or Eurocentric or masculinist or even
986240	991680	militarist. How much of a threat is post-modernism to science? There are certainly some external
991680	997680	attacks. In the 2017 protests against a talk given by Charles Murray at Middlebury, the protesters
997680	1004640	chanted as one, quote, Science has always been used to legitimize racism, sexism, classism,
1004640	1010640	transphobia, ableism and homophobia, all veiled as rational and fact and supported by the government
1010640	1016000	and state. In this world today, there is little that is true fact. When the organizers of the
1016000	1022880	March for Science tweeted, colonization, racism, immigration, native rights, sexism, ableism,
1022880	1029040	queer, trans, intersexphobia and econ justice are scientific issues. Many scientists immediately
1029040	1034480	criticizes politicization of science and derailment of the focus on preservation of science to
1034480	1040480	intersectional ideology. In South Africa, the hashtag science must fall and hashtag decolonize
1040480	1045280	science, progressive student movement announced that science was only one way of knowing that
1045280	1050720	people have been taught to accept. They suggested witchcraft as one alternative. Despite this,
1050720	1056400	science as a methodology is not going anywhere. It cannot be adapted to include epistemic
1056400	1062320	relativism and alternative ways of knowing. It can, however, lose public confidence and thereby
1062320	1067920	state funding and this is a threat not to be underestimated. Also, at a time in which world
1067920	1073600	rulers doubt climate change, parents believe false claims that vaccines cause autism and people turn
1073600	1078800	to homopaths and naturopaths for solutions to serious medical conditions. It is dangerous to
1078800	1083440	the degree of an existential threat to further damage people's confidence in the empirical
1083440	1088480	sciences. The social sciences and humanities, however, are in danger of changing out of all
1088480	1093680	recognition. Some disciplines within the social sciences already have, cultural anthropology,
1093680	1098960	sociology, cultural studies and gender studies, for example, have succumbed almost entirely not
1098960	1104320	only to moral relativism but epistemic relativism. English literature too, in my experience, is
1104320	1109680	teaching a thoroughly postmodern orthodoxy. Philosophy, as we have seen, is divided. So is
1109680	1114640	history. Empirical historians are often criticized by the postmodernists among us for claiming to
1114640	1119920	know what really happened in the past. Christopher Butler recalls Diane Perkus' accusation that
1119920	1125120	Keith Thomas was enabling a myth that grounded men's historical identity in the powerlessness
1125120	1130160	and speechlessness of women when he provided evidence that accused witches were usually powerless
1130160	1134880	beggar women. Resumably, he should have claimed against the evidence that they were wealthy women
1134880	1140720	or better still, men. As Butler says, it seems as though Thomas' empirical claims here simply run
1140720	1146160	foul of Perkus' rival organizing principle for historical narrative that it should be used to
1146160	1151360	support contemporary notions of female empowerment. I account to the same problem when trying to write
1151360	1156320	about race and gender at the turn of the 17th century. I'd argue that Shakespeare's audiences
1156320	1161280	would not have found Desdemona's attraction to Black Othello, who is Christian and a soldier for
1161280	1165760	Venice, so difficult to understand. Because prejudice against skin colour did not become
1165760	1170480	prevalent until little later in the 17th century, when the Atlantic slave trade gained steam,
1170480	1175360	and that religious and national differences were far more profound before that. I was told this was
1175360	1180160	problematic by an eminent professor and asked how Black communities in contemporary America would
1180160	1185680	feel about my claim. If today's African Americans felt badly about it, it was implied it either could
1185680	1190960	not have been true in the 17th century or it is morally wrong to mention it. As Christopher Butler
1190960	1196080	says, postmodernist thought sees the culture as containing a number of perpetually competing
1196080	1201520	stories whose effectiveness depends not so much on an appeal to an independent standard of judgment,
1201520	1206560	as upon their appeal to the communities in which they circulate. I fear for the future of the
1206560	1212560	humanities. Postmodernism beyond the Academy. The dangers of postmodernism are not limited to
1212560	1218000	pockets of society which center on academia and social justice, however. Relativist ideas,
1218000	1224000	sensitivity to language, and focus on identity over humanity or individuality have gained dominance
1224000	1229600	in wider society. It is much easier to say what you feel than rigorously examine the evidence.
1229600	1234960	The freedom to interpret reality according to one's own values feeds into the very human tendency
1234960	1240080	towards confirmation bias and motivated reasoning. It has become commonplace to note that the far
1240080	1245680	right is now using identity politics and epistemic relativism in a very similar way to the postmodern
1245680	1250560	left. Of course, elements of the far right have always been divisive on the grounds of race,
1250560	1255840	gender, and sexuality, and prone to irrational and anti-science views. But postmodernism has
1255840	1260640	produced a culture more widely receptive to this. Kenan Malik describes this shift, quote,
1260640	1265360	when I suggested earlier that the idea of alternative facts draws upon, quote,
1265360	1270000	a set of concepts that in recent decades have been used by radicals. I was not suggesting
1270000	1274800	that Kellyanne Conway or Steve Bannon, still less Donald Trump, have been reading up on Foucault
1274800	1280160	or Baudrillard. It is rather that sections of academia on the left have in recent decades helped
1280160	1285600	create a culture in which relativized views, effects, and knowledge seem untroubling and hence
1285680	1291200	made it easier for the reaction right not just to reappropriate but also to promote reactionary
1291200	1296320	ideas. This set of concepts threatens to take us back to a time before the Enlightenment when
1296320	1302400	reason was regarded as not only inferior to faith but as a sin. James K. A. Smith, Reformed Theologian
1302400	1307280	and Professor of Philosophy, has been quick to see the advantages for Christianity and regards
1307280	1312640	postmodernism as, quote, a fresh wind of the spirit sent to revitalize the dry bones of the
1312640	1318720	church. In Who's Afraid of Postmodernism, taking Derrida, Leotard, and Foucault to church, he says,
1318720	1323680	a thoughtful engagement with postmodernism will encourage us to look backward. We will see that
1323680	1328640	much that goes under the banner of postmodern philosophy has one eye on ancient and medieval
1328640	1335200	sources and constitutes a significant recovery of pre-modern ways of knowing, being, and doing.
1335200	1340640	And postmodernism can be a catalyst for the church to reclaim its faith, not as a system of truth
1340640	1347440	dictated by mutual reason, but rather as a story that requires eyes to see and ears to hear. We on
1347440	1352560	the left should be very afraid of what our side has produced. Of course, not every problem in
1352560	1357840	society today is the fault of postmodern thinking and it is not helpful to suggest that it is.
1357840	1362800	The rise of populism and nationalism in the US and across Europe are also due to a strong
1362800	1368320	existing far right and the fear of Islamism produced by the refugee crisis. Taking a rigidly
1368320	1374240	anti-SJW stance and blaming everything on this element of the left is itself rife with motivated
1374240	1378960	reasoning and confirmation bias. The left is not responsible for the far right or the religious
1378960	1384480	right or secular nationalism, but it is responsible for not engaging with reasonable concerns reasonably
1384480	1389920	and thereby making itself harder for reasonable people to support. It is responsible for its own
1389920	1396160	fragmentation, purity demands, and divisiveness, which make even the far right appear comparatively
1396160	1402000	coherent and cohesive. In order to regain credibility, the left needs to recover a strong,
1402000	1407200	coherent, and reasonable liberalism. To do this, we need to out-discourse the postmodern left.
1407200	1411680	We need to meet their oppositions, divisions, and hierarchies with universal principles of
1411680	1416960	freedom, equality, and justice. There must be a consistency of liberal principles in opposition
1416960	1422480	to all attempts to evaluate or limit people by race, gender, or sexuality. We must address
1422480	1427680	concerns about immigration, globalism, and authoritarian identity politics, currently
1427680	1433520	empowering the far right, rather than calling people who express them racist, sexist, or homophobic,
1433520	1438160	and accusing them of wanting to commit verbal violence. We can do this whilst continuing to
1438160	1443280	oppose authoritarian factions the right, who genuinely are racist, sexist, and homophobic,
1443280	1448240	but can now hide behind a facade of reasonable opposition to the postmodern left. Our current
1448240	1454480	crisis is not one of left versus right, but of consistency, reason, humility, and universal
1454480	1460480	liberalism versus inconsistency, irrationalism, zealous certainty, and tribal authoritarianism.
1460480	1465040	The future of freedom, equality, and justice looks equally bleak, whether the postmodern left
1465040	1470080	or the post-truth right wins this current war. Those of us who value liberal democracy and the
1470080	1475200	fruits of the Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution and modernity itself must provide
1475200	1478480	a better option. Thank you for listening.
1505200	1506480	you
