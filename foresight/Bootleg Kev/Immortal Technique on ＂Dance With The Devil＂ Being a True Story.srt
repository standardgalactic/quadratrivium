1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,360
Obviously perception wise as a kid

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,480
You know, I didn't associate a green lantern and immortal even though it makes sense like musically and it was dope

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,300
But yeah, I think it like like you said like you pointed out so much stuff

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,880
Early because again at that time we didn't have access to YouTube and like jumping down a rabbit hole and it's like wait a minute

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,960
What is he talking about like, you know, I think um, I think that you

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,540
definitely, uh, you know in terms of

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,440
Shedding the light to a whole generation of kids who were just hip-hop heads

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,280
You definitely did open their eyes to a lot of wild shit, man and a lot of truthful shit, right?

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,800
And also, I think that even to this day

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,920
There's songs that I've written that people still ask me questions about like I'm not gonna lie kev

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,320
Even 20 years later people ask me is dance with the devil a true story and I have to look these people right in the eye and say

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,240
Sir, I am not responsible for raping or killing any women. That is absolutely crazy

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:11,880
It is a song. However, yeah, I can take people if they really want to the building where this incident happened in Harlem

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:19,040
And the truth is that that actually did happen and those people that were allegedly responsible for that began dying

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,120
And that's why it became such a powerful story because everyone's like, oh, you're telling hoodtales

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,640
What if these motherfuckers come back for you and I said let them right what they're gonna do?

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,960
Like you think that the neighborhood is gonna protect them after they find out what they really did that they raped a woman

19
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,520
Do you realize that in rich communities? You can get away with stuff like that

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,280
Yeah, oh, they're little kids coming in all hours of the night

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,520
No one says anything billionaires, but if you live in a ghetto and someone says a rumor in the hood

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,360
Oh, someone's touching kids in apartment. You think they're gonna go up. Oh everybody from the neighborhood

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,040
Get back the door down. Yeah, the fuck is going on in your homes

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,400
So that's the kind of energy it was and these people literally started dying and one of them I

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,560
We're not gonna mention names because these people don't deserve to be remembered in a good light

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,920
But this is a sad story

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,900
They couldn't find this man Kevin and I what I explained to people about the street is that there's no there's no rules

28
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,080
Just like there's no such thing as a safe gun. You have to respect everything. I'm a big second amendment guy

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,640
Respect the weapon is no such thing as a safe gun

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,720
These people were out here thinking that they could get away with a crime and that they wouldn't be found and they murdered this man's son

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,440
To get him to come to the funeral so they could kill him

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,600
This is the type of shit that people were dealing with. That's one of your would you say that your most popular song?

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
It's like one of them, right? Yeah

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,840
For people who because there's gonna be people watching this YouTube video who subscribe who maybe are not hip to your catalog

35
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,040
Give us a break like it for people who haven't heard dance with the devil. What is the premise of the record?

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,720
Well, I mean without giving the entire thing away. I would say that

37
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,120
It's definitely a very realistic tale of what happens when people feel peer-pressured

38
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,200
To commit violence to join a gang or when they feel like they have to overcompensate

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:14,080
For not being as tough as everybody thinks they is and they commit violence and do horrible things to people to try to prove

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,480
Something to somebody I remind individuals that are really living in the street. We don't deal with gratuitous violence

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,240
We deal with people that have offended or hurt us who have come into our neighborhood and caused problems

42
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,920
the premise of going into another neighborhood and just

43
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,840
Trying to hurt people right doesn't make sense now

44
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,320
I mean, even if you ask the essays that run each block to be like, why would I start a war for no reason?

45
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,240
But in New York City, it was structured differently. It wasn't so much gangs. It was crews back in New York

46
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:52,160
Right, right. So if you heard about a story like this, it became an urban legend immediately and not just that Kev

47
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,660
It was that

48
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,560
The story was always a little bit different instead of it being the guy's mom

49
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,680
It would be the person's stepsister. It would be the aunt

50
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,200
It would be someone related and I think when you have tales about, you know

51
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,880
Murder or killing people. It's a grand eyes

52
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,720
Some sometimes in hip-hop to the point that you never really see the impact of what that is

53
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,240
Like even if y'all kill someone that's not a kid if y'all kill someone that's 30 years old

54
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,320
You think that's not somebody son, of course, you don't think you have a target on your back

55
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,880
You don't think that somebody's coming back. Yeah, that's the reality then and more often than not when people come up to me

56
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,940
They say, oh, do you think the guys from dance with the devil were really cursed by the devil?

57
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:40,740
And I'm like, no, they live the horrible lifestyle where they thought they could get away with hurting people at random and

58
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,740
Eventually it catches up not just to them, but to their children as well
