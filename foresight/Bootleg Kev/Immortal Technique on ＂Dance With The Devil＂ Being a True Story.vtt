WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I

00:07.360 --> 00:09.360
Obviously perception wise as a kid

00:09.760 --> 00:15.480
You know, I didn't associate a green lantern and immortal even though it makes sense like musically and it was dope

00:15.480 --> 00:19.300
But yeah, I think it like like you said like you pointed out so much stuff

00:20.160 --> 00:25.880
Early because again at that time we didn't have access to YouTube and like jumping down a rabbit hole and it's like wait a minute

00:25.880 --> 00:29.960
What is he talking about like, you know, I think um, I think that you

00:30.040 --> 00:32.540
definitely, uh, you know in terms of

00:33.520 --> 00:36.440
Shedding the light to a whole generation of kids who were just hip-hop heads

00:36.440 --> 00:41.280
You definitely did open their eyes to a lot of wild shit, man and a lot of truthful shit, right?

00:41.280 --> 00:44.800
And also, I think that even to this day

00:45.200 --> 00:49.920
There's songs that I've written that people still ask me questions about like I'm not gonna lie kev

00:50.280 --> 00:57.320
Even 20 years later people ask me is dance with the devil a true story and I have to look these people right in the eye and say

00:58.160 --> 01:04.240
Sir, I am not responsible for raping or killing any women. That is absolutely crazy

01:04.240 --> 01:11.880
It is a song. However, yeah, I can take people if they really want to the building where this incident happened in Harlem

01:11.880 --> 01:19.040
And the truth is that that actually did happen and those people that were allegedly responsible for that began dying

01:19.040 --> 01:24.120
And that's why it became such a powerful story because everyone's like, oh, you're telling hoodtales

01:24.200 --> 01:28.640
What if these motherfuckers come back for you and I said let them right what they're gonna do?

01:28.640 --> 01:33.960
Like you think that the neighborhood is gonna protect them after they find out what they really did that they raped a woman

01:33.960 --> 01:37.520
Do you realize that in rich communities? You can get away with stuff like that

01:37.520 --> 01:40.280
Yeah, oh, they're little kids coming in all hours of the night

01:40.280 --> 01:45.520
No one says anything billionaires, but if you live in a ghetto and someone says a rumor in the hood

01:45.520 --> 01:50.360
Oh, someone's touching kids in apartment. You think they're gonna go up. Oh everybody from the neighborhood

01:51.200 --> 01:54.040
Get back the door down. Yeah, the fuck is going on in your homes

01:54.120 --> 01:59.400
So that's the kind of energy it was and these people literally started dying and one of them I

02:00.480 --> 02:04.560
We're not gonna mention names because these people don't deserve to be remembered in a good light

02:04.560 --> 02:05.920
But this is a sad story

02:05.920 --> 02:11.900
They couldn't find this man Kevin and I what I explained to people about the street is that there's no there's no rules

02:11.900 --> 02:17.080
Just like there's no such thing as a safe gun. You have to respect everything. I'm a big second amendment guy

02:17.320 --> 02:20.640
Respect the weapon is no such thing as a safe gun

02:20.760 --> 02:27.720
These people were out here thinking that they could get away with a crime and that they wouldn't be found and they murdered this man's son

02:28.000 --> 02:31.440
To get him to come to the funeral so they could kill him

02:32.120 --> 02:37.600
This is the type of shit that people were dealing with. That's one of your would you say that your most popular song?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.600
It's like one of them, right? Yeah

02:39.960 --> 02:45.840
For people who because there's gonna be people watching this YouTube video who subscribe who maybe are not hip to your catalog

02:46.440 --> 02:51.040
Give us a break like it for people who haven't heard dance with the devil. What is the premise of the record?

02:51.120 --> 02:54.720
Well, I mean without giving the entire thing away. I would say that

02:55.480 --> 03:01.120
It's definitely a very realistic tale of what happens when people feel peer-pressured

03:01.560 --> 03:06.200
To commit violence to join a gang or when they feel like they have to overcompensate

03:06.960 --> 03:14.080
For not being as tough as everybody thinks they is and they commit violence and do horrible things to people to try to prove

03:14.080 --> 03:20.480
Something to somebody I remind individuals that are really living in the street. We don't deal with gratuitous violence

03:20.600 --> 03:26.240
We deal with people that have offended or hurt us who have come into our neighborhood and caused problems

03:26.320 --> 03:29.920
the premise of going into another neighborhood and just

03:30.720 --> 03:33.840
Trying to hurt people right doesn't make sense now

03:33.840 --> 03:39.320
I mean, even if you ask the essays that run each block to be like, why would I start a war for no reason?

03:39.320 --> 03:45.240
But in New York City, it was structured differently. It wasn't so much gangs. It was crews back in New York

03:45.240 --> 03:52.160
Right, right. So if you heard about a story like this, it became an urban legend immediately and not just that Kev

03:52.160 --> 03:53.660
It was that

03:53.660 --> 03:57.560
The story was always a little bit different instead of it being the guy's mom

03:57.560 --> 04:00.680
It would be the person's stepsister. It would be the aunt

04:00.680 --> 04:06.200
It would be someone related and I think when you have tales about, you know

04:06.760 --> 04:09.880
Murder or killing people. It's a grand eyes

04:09.960 --> 04:15.720
Some sometimes in hip-hop to the point that you never really see the impact of what that is

04:15.720 --> 04:20.240
Like even if y'all kill someone that's not a kid if y'all kill someone that's 30 years old

04:20.240 --> 04:24.320
You think that's not somebody son, of course, you don't think you have a target on your back

04:24.320 --> 04:30.880
You don't think that somebody's coming back. Yeah, that's the reality then and more often than not when people come up to me

04:30.880 --> 04:34.940
They say, oh, do you think the guys from dance with the devil were really cursed by the devil?

04:34.940 --> 04:40.740
And I'm like, no, they live the horrible lifestyle where they thought they could get away with hurting people at random and

04:41.540 --> 04:45.740
Eventually it catches up not just to them, but to their children as well
