0	2000	I
7360	9360	Obviously perception wise as a kid
9760	15480	You know, I didn't associate a green lantern and immortal even though it makes sense like musically and it was dope
15480	19300	But yeah, I think it like like you said like you pointed out so much stuff
20160	25880	Early because again at that time we didn't have access to YouTube and like jumping down a rabbit hole and it's like wait a minute
25880	29960	What is he talking about like, you know, I think um, I think that you
30040	32540	definitely, uh, you know in terms of
33520	36440	Shedding the light to a whole generation of kids who were just hip-hop heads
36440	41280	You definitely did open their eyes to a lot of wild shit, man and a lot of truthful shit, right?
41280	44800	And also, I think that even to this day
45200	49920	There's songs that I've written that people still ask me questions about like I'm not gonna lie kev
50280	57320	Even 20 years later people ask me is dance with the devil a true story and I have to look these people right in the eye and say
58160	64240	Sir, I am not responsible for raping or killing any women. That is absolutely crazy
64240	71880	It is a song. However, yeah, I can take people if they really want to the building where this incident happened in Harlem
71880	79040	And the truth is that that actually did happen and those people that were allegedly responsible for that began dying
79040	84120	And that's why it became such a powerful story because everyone's like, oh, you're telling hoodtales
84200	88640	What if these motherfuckers come back for you and I said let them right what they're gonna do?
88640	93960	Like you think that the neighborhood is gonna protect them after they find out what they really did that they raped a woman
93960	97520	Do you realize that in rich communities? You can get away with stuff like that
97520	100280	Yeah, oh, they're little kids coming in all hours of the night
100280	105520	No one says anything billionaires, but if you live in a ghetto and someone says a rumor in the hood
105520	110360	Oh, someone's touching kids in apartment. You think they're gonna go up. Oh everybody from the neighborhood
111200	114040	Get back the door down. Yeah, the fuck is going on in your homes
114120	119400	So that's the kind of energy it was and these people literally started dying and one of them I
120480	124560	We're not gonna mention names because these people don't deserve to be remembered in a good light
124560	125920	But this is a sad story
125920	131900	They couldn't find this man Kevin and I what I explained to people about the street is that there's no there's no rules
131900	137080	Just like there's no such thing as a safe gun. You have to respect everything. I'm a big second amendment guy
137320	140640	Respect the weapon is no such thing as a safe gun
140760	147720	These people were out here thinking that they could get away with a crime and that they wouldn't be found and they murdered this man's son
148000	151440	To get him to come to the funeral so they could kill him
152120	157600	This is the type of shit that people were dealing with. That's one of your would you say that your most popular song?
157600	159600	It's like one of them, right? Yeah
159960	165840	For people who because there's gonna be people watching this YouTube video who subscribe who maybe are not hip to your catalog
166440	171040	Give us a break like it for people who haven't heard dance with the devil. What is the premise of the record?
171120	174720	Well, I mean without giving the entire thing away. I would say that
175480	181120	It's definitely a very realistic tale of what happens when people feel peer-pressured
181560	186200	To commit violence to join a gang or when they feel like they have to overcompensate
186960	194080	For not being as tough as everybody thinks they is and they commit violence and do horrible things to people to try to prove
194080	200480	Something to somebody I remind individuals that are really living in the street. We don't deal with gratuitous violence
200600	206240	We deal with people that have offended or hurt us who have come into our neighborhood and caused problems
206320	209920	the premise of going into another neighborhood and just
210720	213840	Trying to hurt people right doesn't make sense now
213840	219320	I mean, even if you ask the essays that run each block to be like, why would I start a war for no reason?
219320	225240	But in New York City, it was structured differently. It wasn't so much gangs. It was crews back in New York
225240	232160	Right, right. So if you heard about a story like this, it became an urban legend immediately and not just that Kev
232160	233660	It was that
233660	237560	The story was always a little bit different instead of it being the guy's mom
237560	240680	It would be the person's stepsister. It would be the aunt
240680	246200	It would be someone related and I think when you have tales about, you know
246760	249880	Murder or killing people. It's a grand eyes
249960	255720	Some sometimes in hip-hop to the point that you never really see the impact of what that is
255720	260240	Like even if y'all kill someone that's not a kid if y'all kill someone that's 30 years old
260240	264320	You think that's not somebody son, of course, you don't think you have a target on your back
264320	270880	You don't think that somebody's coming back. Yeah, that's the reality then and more often than not when people come up to me
270880	274940	They say, oh, do you think the guys from dance with the devil were really cursed by the devil?
274940	280740	And I'm like, no, they live the horrible lifestyle where they thought they could get away with hurting people at random and
281540	285740	Eventually it catches up not just to them, but to their children as well
