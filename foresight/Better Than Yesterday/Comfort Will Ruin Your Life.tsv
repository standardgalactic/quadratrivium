0	12520	We usually avoid difficulty whenever we can, but I try to do something difficult every
12520	13840	single day.
13840	18320	In this video, I'll explain the three main reasons behind why I've chosen this approach,
18320	22760	and by the end, perhaps you will be inspired to do something difficult today yourself.
22760	25160	So let's dive in.
25160	28680	This circle right here is where most people are operating.
28680	30880	This is our comfort zone.
30880	33560	Everyone has one and we like being in it.
33560	36000	Usually it looks something like this.
36000	40600	Going to school or a job where we do what is required of us to get by, but not necessarily
40600	42120	more than that.
42120	46780	Getting quick dopamine fixes throughout the day on our phones or other devices, spending
46780	51080	weekends hanging out with the same people we've always socialized with, holding on
51080	55960	to the same beliefs we had for years and failing to consider different opinions.
55960	58920	Usually it means taking the path of least resistance.
58920	64080	Life becomes a predictable routine with no real challenges and we find ourselves stagnating.
64080	68880	And it's easy to understand why the majority of people stay here for most of their lives.
68880	73240	As the name implies, it's comfortable here, since we're not pushing ourselves.
73240	76340	At a first glance, there seems to be nothing wrong with that.
76340	81280	Why would we voluntarily put ourselves in a position of struggle if we don't have to?
81280	85360	But if we only live our lives in the comfort zone, we might be unknowingly doing ourselves
85360	87000	an injustice.
87000	92360	You see, while our comfort zone is indeed comfortable, it also has one big downside.
92360	96480	People who are stuck here for too long don't just stagnate, but they often regress backwards
96480	97640	as well.
97640	101560	When you're doing the same things the same way, over and over, the comfort zone itself
101560	103000	begins to shrink.
103000	106800	The things that you were comfortable with before are now less comfortable.
106800	109240	Let me give you an example.
109240	113120	Someone who is socially anxious and is afraid of social interaction usually doesn't like
113120	115240	the idea of meeting new people.
115240	118200	Experiencing that is outside their comfort zone.
118200	122000	So instead they prefer to spend their time alone, or if they do socialize, it's with
122000	124480	people they already know well.
124480	125840	And that's fine.
125840	129400	But let's say this person starts spending less time with their current friends and even
129400	130840	more time alone.
130840	134520	Slowly, their current comfort zone will become smaller.
134520	138320	Because they don't confront their fear, the fear becomes even bigger.
138320	142960	And even the idea of calling up their current friend group might become more difficult.
142960	148600	So you can see how paradoxically giving into current comfort can lead to future discomfort.
148600	153360	When a muscle isn't used for a longer period of time, it atrophies and gets smaller because
153360	156120	there is no reason for it to stay big.
156120	158840	The same happens when we don't challenge ourselves.
158840	162960	We become less capable of handling the obstacles that life throws at us.
162960	166640	And that is the first reason why I try to do something difficult every day.
166640	170040	I don't want to stagnate and I don't want the things that I'm comfortable with now
170040	172720	become uncomfortable in the future.
172720	176600	However, when we push ourselves and do something that is a little more difficult or challenging
176600	179160	for us, we leave the comfort zone.
179160	181560	Then we enter the growth zone.
181560	185760	This is where we struggle and we might feel like incompetent fools, but this is exactly
185760	188160	where all real progress is made.
188160	190720	And you have probably noticed this yourself.
190720	195320	When working out at the gym, you don't improve if you simply live the same weight every time.
195320	199040	When learning a new language, you're not advancing if you only practice what you already
199040	200040	know.
200040	205060	To improve and see progress, you have to leave the comfort zone and increase the challenge.
205060	208640	That might mean increasing the weights on your lifts or reading something new and trying
208640	210800	to recall that information without help.
210800	216080	Yes, it will be uncomfortable, yes, you will struggle, and yes, you will probably feel
216080	217440	like an idiot.
217440	221240	But doing anything worthwhile requires you to go through this because the things that
221240	224720	have the biggest payoff always feel difficult in the moment.
224720	227000	There's no improvement without challenge.
227000	228880	Remember that.
228880	232580	Of course, the comfort zone isn't just one single zone for everything.
232580	234580	We have multiple zones.
234580	238680	You might be pushing yourself in some of them, stagnating in others, and even deteriorating
238680	239880	in some.
239880	244480	For example, you could be regressing backwards with your social skills, stagnating with your
244480	247880	work, but pushing yourself to the limit at the gym.
247880	251440	It's up to each of us to identify which zone needs more work.
251440	255120	And it's completely fine to stop progressing in some areas if you're happy with where
255120	256280	you are.
256280	259400	There is no need to push yourself at everything you do.
259400	263480	But if you're not happy with where you are, there are a few ways to go from comfort to
263480	264840	growth.
264840	269040	You probably already have a certain area in mind where you're kind of stuck and want
269040	270240	to improve.
270240	272360	There are three ways to go about it.
272360	275440	The first way is by doing it more consistently.
275440	278440	The second way is by doing it more intensely.
278440	282500	And lastly, the third way is by doing it for longer periods of time.
282500	286380	All three of them will increase the difficulty of whatever you want to improve on.
286380	290660	I think they're mostly self-explanatory, but I'll quickly go over them using running
290660	292020	as an example.
292020	296660	Firstly, doing it more consistently simply means that instead of running 3 days a week,
296660	298860	you try to raise it to 4 days.
298860	301940	Since you're doing it more often, it becomes more challenging.
301940	305620	But this also helps consolidate the behavior and makes it more likely for you to do it
305620	307220	in the future as well.
307220	311220	Secondly, doing it more intensely means that you do a more potent version of what you
311220	312380	usually do.
312380	317020	This might mean trying something new, like running sprints or running up a hill.
317020	321740	Basically instead of running at 60% of your capacity, you bump it to 90%.
321740	325500	This also adds variety and actually makes the activity more fun because you're not
325500	327820	doing the same thing every single time.
327820	332380	Thirdly, doing it for longer periods simply means spending more time on it whenever you
332380	333860	decide to do it.
333860	339380	So if you usually go for a 20 minute run, you now try to do it for 30 minutes instead.
339380	343220	Simply you push yourself and persevere through it just a little longer than you normally
343220	344220	do.
344220	345460	Simple as that.
345460	349340	And all of this can be applied to pretty much any activity.
349340	350700	Learning a new language?
350700	355420	Do it daily, maybe even multiple times a day if possible, increase the time you spend learning
355420	361300	by 15 minutes and use active recall along with spaced repetition to remember more.
361300	363620	Trying to improve your social skills?
363620	367900	Consistently put yourself into environments where social situations might occur, try saying
367900	373260	an extra sentence each time you find yourself in one and be the one who invites people out.
373260	376900	All of those three methods are a good way to move from comfort towards growth.
376900	380940	But depending on the area you're working on, some of them are more useful.
380940	384460	For example, if you're trying to learn an instrument, you will find that it's actually
384460	389660	better to play every day for 10 minutes than it is to play once a week for 1 intense hour.
389660	393340	Also you shouldn't necessarily use all three methods at the same time or it might be too
393340	395420	much too fast.
395420	398980	Instead you want to pick one and once you're ready, expand from there.
398980	401700	But more on that later.
401700	406140	Now as I mentioned, most of the gains in life come from short term discomfort.
406140	410900	With that being said, if something is difficult, it doesn't automatically mean it's good.
410900	414660	Breaking your leg might be uncomfortable but I don't know of any positive results that
414660	416380	might have in the long term.
416380	421660	The area you want to be uncomfortable in has to have some sort of a long term benefit.
421660	425180	Eating something, for example, makes you feel stupid in the moment but because you
425180	428780	absorb new concepts, you get smarter over time.
428780	432940	Eating healthily and resisting sugar might be difficult but it is what allows you to
432940	436260	get in and stay in good physical condition.
436260	440180	Saving money instead of splurging on a new pair of shoes might be hard but if invested
440180	443980	properly and given enough time, it will make you wealthier.
443980	447420	So these types of areas are where you should actually push yourself.
447420	451220	The ones with short term pain but long term gain.
451220	455220	And that is the second reason why I try to do something difficult every day.
455220	458780	Even though it might feel uncomfortable in the moment, I know that my behavior will pay
458780	460180	off in the future.
460180	464740	And only by entering the growth zone and pushing myself, am I able to reap those positive long
464740	466180	term benefits.
466180	471420	Okay then, so why don't more of us leave the comfort zone if it's clearly beneficial
471420	472420	to do so?
472420	475660	Well, that's because there's actually a third zone.
475660	479420	If someone were to push themselves too far out of their comfort zone, they just might
479420	483500	pass the growth zone and go straight into the danger zone.
483500	486380	This is why we feel uncomfortable in the first place.
486380	489260	There is such a thing as pushing yourself too far.
489260	492940	After all, if you exercise too much, you might suffer an injury.
492940	496100	If you work too much, you might experience burnout.
496100	500700	And discomfort is actually a very useful alarm preventing you from getting hurt as such an
500700	503540	injury would likely set you further back.
503540	507100	So it makes perfect sense why most people stay in their comfort zones.
507100	510140	They want to avoid the danger zone at all costs.
510140	513860	But unfortunately, a lot of people, when they're looking to make a positive change in their
513860	516820	life, go straight into the danger zone.
516820	518540	One of my friends is like this.
518540	521700	A few years ago, he wanted to improve his physical health.
521700	526100	With newfound motivation, he joined the gym and made a commitment to lift weights 5 times
526100	527100	a week.
527100	531660	He also vowed to start a strict diet where he would reduce his caloric intake and cut
531660	532660	out all sugar.
532660	537060	But within one month, he was back to routinely sitting on the couch, watching Netflix and
537060	539180	stuffing himself with cookies.
539180	542500	Like most people, he took on too much too quickly.
542500	546220	And this is a very common occurrence when trying to leave the comfort zone.
546220	550060	However, failing to stick to a plan isn't even the worst part.
550060	553740	The bigger issue people now have is that because they fail at keeping up with their
553740	558780	high expectations, they also feed their belief that it's entirely impossible for them to
558780	560300	change and grow.
560300	564340	Because of that, they don't even bother trying to improve themselves in the future.
564340	568220	In their mind, they're failures who shouldn't try again.
568220	570140	So what's the solution here?
570140	574900	How do we make getting out of the comfort zone easier so we can operate in the growth zone,
574900	577500	but at the same time avoid the danger zone?
577500	581060	Positive change requires moving beyond our comfort zone, yes.
581060	584300	However, nowhere does it say all has to be done at once.
584300	590060	A far more effective method is to go about it gradually in small and manageable increments.
590060	594180	After all, if someone has been completely sedentary and wants to begin exercising, it
594180	598900	doesn't make sense to start doing intense weightlifting for 2 hours 5 times a week.
598900	602900	Their odds of success are far higher if they just begin with something they're actually
602900	609580	capable of doing, like having a light gym session 3 times a week for 45 minutes.
609580	612820	And only once they're able to maintain that, push further.
612820	617420	Remember, if you aren't able to commit to a small change, how can you expect to commit
617420	619140	to a big one?
619140	621580	Just something to think about.
621580	627380	Another benefit that comes from doing it gradually is that you create a positive feedback loop.
627380	630880	Since you're actually able to do what you set out to do, you give yourself evidence
630880	633300	that you can indeed improve and change.
633300	637540	And this proof of progress, even if it's small, makes you feel really good and more
637540	639620	confident in your abilities.
639620	644820	This in turn fuels persistence to push through more challenges further down the path.
644820	648780	Basically success starts to feed on itself and you keep pushing further out of the comfort
648780	649780	zone.
649780	654260	Also, when you get a positive feedback loop going in one area, it tends to slowly spread
654260	656060	to other areas.
656060	659700	And this is the third reason why I try to do something difficult every day.
659700	664420	Whenever I'm able to do something outside my comfort zone, even if it's just by a little,
664420	667180	it kick starts this positive feedback loop.
667180	672660	And just like falling dominoes, success fuels further success.
672660	676480	That being said, you shouldn't push past your comfort zone all the time.
676480	680200	When I say I do something difficult every day, don't mistake this for me trying to
680200	683560	expand in every single area on a daily basis.
683560	688840	I might be pushing myself in one or two areas, but during that time I return back to the
688840	691040	comfort zone in other areas.
691040	696040	This allows me to maintain my current zone, but also get sufficient rest and recovery.
696040	698520	Without rest, I would probably burn out.
698520	703720	Yes, over time you want to grow, but you also want to give your comfort zone time to catch
703720	705300	up to the new demands.
705300	708700	This graph is a rough example of how I believe it should look like.
708700	712140	First, you expand your comfort zone by doing something difficult.
712140	714580	But you don't keep expanding indefinitely.
714580	719380	Instead, when it starts feeling too overwhelming, you lower the difficulty and retract only
719380	722580	slightly above what your comfort zone was before.
722580	726100	This allows you to get used to the new layer and you let your comfort zone catch up to
726100	729420	your new demands, which prevents you from burning out.
729420	732580	Only once you've adapted to the new demands and you feel like you're ready to improve
732580	735580	again, you push past your new comfort zone.
735580	739900	Just like before, once you feel like it's too hard, you retract slightly above the previous
739900	740900	point.
740900	744700	Essentially, you're consistently challenging yourself, but also coming back for air when
744700	746260	it gets too difficult.
746260	751220	And you can repeat this process until you reach the level you want to be at.
751220	756140	Another way to look at it is to think about the comfort zone as a place of temporary refuge,
756140	759220	but not a permanent residence.
759220	763300	As you can see, the point of this video isn't to overexert yourself until you can't go
763300	764300	any further.
764300	769060	Rather, I'm trying to convince you to find a worthy challenge in hopes of bettering yourself
769060	770620	at things you care about.
770620	775100	Unfortunately, a lot of people give up at the first taste of failure or discomfort and
775100	777740	they never see what they're actually capable of.
777740	782060	If you never push yourself to the limit, how can you know where your limit is?
782060	786180	Only those who consistently push past their comfort zones and embrace the struggle are
786180	788580	able to reach their true potential.
788580	792860	So I encourage you to do something today that you find slightly more challenging.
792860	797780	Read a few more pages, do a few extra reps at the gym, learn some new words, try to do
797780	805220	something difficult today and I assure you that you'll become better than yesterday.
