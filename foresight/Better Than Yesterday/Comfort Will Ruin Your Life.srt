1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,520
We usually avoid difficulty whenever we can, but I try to do something difficult every

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,840
single day.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,320
In this video, I'll explain the three main reasons behind why I've chosen this approach,

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,760
and by the end, perhaps you will be inspired to do something difficult today yourself.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,160
So let's dive in.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,680
This circle right here is where most people are operating.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,880
This is our comfort zone.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,560
Everyone has one and we like being in it.

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,000
Usually it looks something like this.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,600
Going to school or a job where we do what is required of us to get by, but not necessarily

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,120
more than that.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,780
Getting quick dopamine fixes throughout the day on our phones or other devices, spending

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,080
weekends hanging out with the same people we've always socialized with, holding on

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,960
to the same beliefs we had for years and failing to consider different opinions.

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,920
Usually it means taking the path of least resistance.

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,080
Life becomes a predictable routine with no real challenges and we find ourselves stagnating.

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,880
And it's easy to understand why the majority of people stay here for most of their lives.

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,240
As the name implies, it's comfortable here, since we're not pushing ourselves.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,340
At a first glance, there seems to be nothing wrong with that.

20
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,280
Why would we voluntarily put ourselves in a position of struggle if we don't have to?

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,360
But if we only live our lives in the comfort zone, we might be unknowingly doing ourselves

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,000
an injustice.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,360
You see, while our comfort zone is indeed comfortable, it also has one big downside.

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,480
People who are stuck here for too long don't just stagnate, but they often regress backwards

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,640
as well.

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,560
When you're doing the same things the same way, over and over, the comfort zone itself

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,000
begins to shrink.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,800
The things that you were comfortable with before are now less comfortable.

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,240
Let me give you an example.

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,120
Someone who is socially anxious and is afraid of social interaction usually doesn't like

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,240
the idea of meeting new people.

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,200
Experiencing that is outside their comfort zone.

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,000
So instead they prefer to spend their time alone, or if they do socialize, it's with

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,480
people they already know well.

35
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,840
And that's fine.

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,400
But let's say this person starts spending less time with their current friends and even

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,840
more time alone.

38
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,520
Slowly, their current comfort zone will become smaller.

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,320
Because they don't confront their fear, the fear becomes even bigger.

40
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,960
And even the idea of calling up their current friend group might become more difficult.

41
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,600
So you can see how paradoxically giving into current comfort can lead to future discomfort.

42
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,360
When a muscle isn't used for a longer period of time, it atrophies and gets smaller because

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,120
there is no reason for it to stay big.

44
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,840
The same happens when we don't challenge ourselves.

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,960
We become less capable of handling the obstacles that life throws at us.

46
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,640
And that is the first reason why I try to do something difficult every day.

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,040
I don't want to stagnate and I don't want the things that I'm comfortable with now

48
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,720
become uncomfortable in the future.

49
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,600
However, when we push ourselves and do something that is a little more difficult or challenging

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,160
for us, we leave the comfort zone.

51
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,560
Then we enter the growth zone.

52
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,760
This is where we struggle and we might feel like incompetent fools, but this is exactly

53
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,160
where all real progress is made.

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,720
And you have probably noticed this yourself.

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,320
When working out at the gym, you don't improve if you simply live the same weight every time.

56
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,040
When learning a new language, you're not advancing if you only practice what you already

57
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
know.

58
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,060
To improve and see progress, you have to leave the comfort zone and increase the challenge.

59
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,640
That might mean increasing the weights on your lifts or reading something new and trying

60
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,800
to recall that information without help.

61
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,080
Yes, it will be uncomfortable, yes, you will struggle, and yes, you will probably feel

62
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,440
like an idiot.

63
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,240
But doing anything worthwhile requires you to go through this because the things that

64
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,720
have the biggest payoff always feel difficult in the moment.

65
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,000
There's no improvement without challenge.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,880
Remember that.

67
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,580
Of course, the comfort zone isn't just one single zone for everything.

68
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,580
We have multiple zones.

69
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,680
You might be pushing yourself in some of them, stagnating in others, and even deteriorating

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,880
in some.

71
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,480
For example, you could be regressing backwards with your social skills, stagnating with your

72
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,880
work, but pushing yourself to the limit at the gym.

73
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,440
It's up to each of us to identify which zone needs more work.

74
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,120
And it's completely fine to stop progressing in some areas if you're happy with where

75
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,280
you are.

76
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,400
There is no need to push yourself at everything you do.

77
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,480
But if you're not happy with where you are, there are a few ways to go from comfort to

78
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,840
growth.

79
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,040
You probably already have a certain area in mind where you're kind of stuck and want

80
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,240
to improve.

81
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,360
There are three ways to go about it.

82
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,440
The first way is by doing it more consistently.

83
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,440
The second way is by doing it more intensely.

84
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,500
And lastly, the third way is by doing it for longer periods of time.

85
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,380
All three of them will increase the difficulty of whatever you want to improve on.

86
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,660
I think they're mostly self-explanatory, but I'll quickly go over them using running

87
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,020
as an example.

88
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,660
Firstly, doing it more consistently simply means that instead of running 3 days a week,

89
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,860
you try to raise it to 4 days.

90
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,940
Since you're doing it more often, it becomes more challenging.

91
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,620
But this also helps consolidate the behavior and makes it more likely for you to do it

92
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,220
in the future as well.

93
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,220
Secondly, doing it more intensely means that you do a more potent version of what you

94
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,380
usually do.

95
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,020
This might mean trying something new, like running sprints or running up a hill.

96
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,740
Basically instead of running at 60% of your capacity, you bump it to 90%.

97
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,500
This also adds variety and actually makes the activity more fun because you're not

98
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,820
doing the same thing every single time.

99
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,380
Thirdly, doing it for longer periods simply means spending more time on it whenever you

100
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,860
decide to do it.

101
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,380
So if you usually go for a 20 minute run, you now try to do it for 30 minutes instead.

102
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,220
Simply you push yourself and persevere through it just a little longer than you normally

103
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,220
do.

104
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,460
Simple as that.

105
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,340
And all of this can be applied to pretty much any activity.

106
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,700
Learning a new language?

107
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,420
Do it daily, maybe even multiple times a day if possible, increase the time you spend learning

108
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:01,300
by 15 minutes and use active recall along with spaced repetition to remember more.

109
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,620
Trying to improve your social skills?

110
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,900
Consistently put yourself into environments where social situations might occur, try saying

111
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,260
an extra sentence each time you find yourself in one and be the one who invites people out.

112
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,900
All of those three methods are a good way to move from comfort towards growth.

113
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,940
But depending on the area you're working on, some of them are more useful.

114
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,460
For example, if you're trying to learn an instrument, you will find that it's actually

115
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,660
better to play every day for 10 minutes than it is to play once a week for 1 intense hour.

116
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,340
Also you shouldn't necessarily use all three methods at the same time or it might be too

117
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,420
much too fast.

118
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,980
Instead you want to pick one and once you're ready, expand from there.

119
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,700
But more on that later.

120
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,140
Now as I mentioned, most of the gains in life come from short term discomfort.

121
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,900
With that being said, if something is difficult, it doesn't automatically mean it's good.

122
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,660
Breaking your leg might be uncomfortable but I don't know of any positive results that

123
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,380
might have in the long term.

124
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,660
The area you want to be uncomfortable in has to have some sort of a long term benefit.

125
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,180
Eating something, for example, makes you feel stupid in the moment but because you

126
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,780
absorb new concepts, you get smarter over time.

127
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,940
Eating healthily and resisting sugar might be difficult but it is what allows you to

128
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,260
get in and stay in good physical condition.

129
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,180
Saving money instead of splurging on a new pair of shoes might be hard but if invested

130
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,980
properly and given enough time, it will make you wealthier.

131
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,420
So these types of areas are where you should actually push yourself.

132
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,220
The ones with short term pain but long term gain.

133
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,220
And that is the second reason why I try to do something difficult every day.

134
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,780
Even though it might feel uncomfortable in the moment, I know that my behavior will pay

135
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,180
off in the future.

136
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,740
And only by entering the growth zone and pushing myself, am I able to reap those positive long

137
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,180
term benefits.

138
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,420
Okay then, so why don't more of us leave the comfort zone if it's clearly beneficial

139
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,420
to do so?

140
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,660
Well, that's because there's actually a third zone.

141
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,420
If someone were to push themselves too far out of their comfort zone, they just might

142
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,500
pass the growth zone and go straight into the danger zone.

143
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,380
This is why we feel uncomfortable in the first place.

144
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,260
There is such a thing as pushing yourself too far.

145
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,940
After all, if you exercise too much, you might suffer an injury.

146
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,100
If you work too much, you might experience burnout.

147
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,700
And discomfort is actually a very useful alarm preventing you from getting hurt as such an

148
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,540
injury would likely set you further back.

149
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,100
So it makes perfect sense why most people stay in their comfort zones.

150
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,140
They want to avoid the danger zone at all costs.

151
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,860
But unfortunately, a lot of people, when they're looking to make a positive change in their

152
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,820
life, go straight into the danger zone.

153
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,540
One of my friends is like this.

154
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,700
A few years ago, he wanted to improve his physical health.

155
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,100
With newfound motivation, he joined the gym and made a commitment to lift weights 5 times

156
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,100
a week.

157
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,660
He also vowed to start a strict diet where he would reduce his caloric intake and cut

158
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,660
out all sugar.

159
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,060
But within one month, he was back to routinely sitting on the couch, watching Netflix and

160
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,180
stuffing himself with cookies.

161
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,500
Like most people, he took on too much too quickly.

162
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,220
And this is a very common occurrence when trying to leave the comfort zone.

163
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,060
However, failing to stick to a plan isn't even the worst part.

164
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,740
The bigger issue people now have is that because they fail at keeping up with their

165
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,780
high expectations, they also feed their belief that it's entirely impossible for them to

166
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,300
change and grow.

167
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,340
Because of that, they don't even bother trying to improve themselves in the future.

168
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,220
In their mind, they're failures who shouldn't try again.

169
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,140
So what's the solution here?

170
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,900
How do we make getting out of the comfort zone easier so we can operate in the growth zone,

171
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,500
but at the same time avoid the danger zone?

172
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,060
Positive change requires moving beyond our comfort zone, yes.

173
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,300
However, nowhere does it say all has to be done at once.

174
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,060
A far more effective method is to go about it gradually in small and manageable increments.

175
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,180
After all, if someone has been completely sedentary and wants to begin exercising, it

176
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,900
doesn't make sense to start doing intense weightlifting for 2 hours 5 times a week.

177
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,900
Their odds of success are far higher if they just begin with something they're actually

178
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:09,580
capable of doing, like having a light gym session 3 times a week for 45 minutes.

179
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,820
And only once they're able to maintain that, push further.

180
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,420
Remember, if you aren't able to commit to a small change, how can you expect to commit

181
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,140
to a big one?

182
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,580
Just something to think about.

183
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:27,380
Another benefit that comes from doing it gradually is that you create a positive feedback loop.

184
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,880
Since you're actually able to do what you set out to do, you give yourself evidence

185
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,300
that you can indeed improve and change.

186
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,540
And this proof of progress, even if it's small, makes you feel really good and more

187
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,620
confident in your abilities.

188
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,820
This in turn fuels persistence to push through more challenges further down the path.

189
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,780
Basically success starts to feed on itself and you keep pushing further out of the comfort

190
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,780
zone.

191
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,260
Also, when you get a positive feedback loop going in one area, it tends to slowly spread

192
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,060
to other areas.

193
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,700
And this is the third reason why I try to do something difficult every day.

194
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,420
Whenever I'm able to do something outside my comfort zone, even if it's just by a little,

195
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,180
it kick starts this positive feedback loop.

196
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:12,660
And just like falling dominoes, success fuels further success.

197
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,480
That being said, you shouldn't push past your comfort zone all the time.

198
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,200
When I say I do something difficult every day, don't mistake this for me trying to

199
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,560
expand in every single area on a daily basis.

200
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,840
I might be pushing myself in one or two areas, but during that time I return back to the

201
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,040
comfort zone in other areas.

202
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,040
This allows me to maintain my current zone, but also get sufficient rest and recovery.

203
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,520
Without rest, I would probably burn out.

204
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,720
Yes, over time you want to grow, but you also want to give your comfort zone time to catch

205
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,300
up to the new demands.

206
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,700
This graph is a rough example of how I believe it should look like.

207
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,140
First, you expand your comfort zone by doing something difficult.

208
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,580
But you don't keep expanding indefinitely.

209
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,380
Instead, when it starts feeling too overwhelming, you lower the difficulty and retract only

210
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,580
slightly above what your comfort zone was before.

211
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,100
This allows you to get used to the new layer and you let your comfort zone catch up to

212
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,420
your new demands, which prevents you from burning out.

213
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,580
Only once you've adapted to the new demands and you feel like you're ready to improve

214
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,580
again, you push past your new comfort zone.

215
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,900
Just like before, once you feel like it's too hard, you retract slightly above the previous

216
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,900
point.

217
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,700
Essentially, you're consistently challenging yourself, but also coming back for air when

218
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,260
it gets too difficult.

219
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,220
And you can repeat this process until you reach the level you want to be at.

220
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,140
Another way to look at it is to think about the comfort zone as a place of temporary refuge,

221
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,220
but not a permanent residence.

222
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,300
As you can see, the point of this video isn't to overexert yourself until you can't go

223
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,300
any further.

224
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:49,060
Rather, I'm trying to convince you to find a worthy challenge in hopes of bettering yourself

225
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,620
at things you care about.

226
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,100
Unfortunately, a lot of people give up at the first taste of failure or discomfort and

227
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,740
they never see what they're actually capable of.

228
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,060
If you never push yourself to the limit, how can you know where your limit is?

229
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,180
Only those who consistently push past their comfort zones and embrace the struggle are

230
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,580
able to reach their true potential.

231
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,860
So I encourage you to do something today that you find slightly more challenging.

232
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,780
Read a few more pages, do a few extra reps at the gym, learn some new words, try to do

233
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:25,220
something difficult today and I assure you that you'll become better than yesterday.
