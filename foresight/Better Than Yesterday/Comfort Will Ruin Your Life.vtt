00:00.000 --> 00:12.520
We usually avoid difficulty whenever we can, but I try to do something difficult every

00:12.520 --> 00:13.840
single day.

00:13.840 --> 00:18.320
In this video, I'll explain the three main reasons behind why I've chosen this approach,

00:18.320 --> 00:22.760
and by the end, perhaps you will be inspired to do something difficult today yourself.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.160
So let's dive in.

00:25.160 --> 00:28.680
This circle right here is where most people are operating.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.880
This is our comfort zone.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.560
Everyone has one and we like being in it.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.000
Usually it looks something like this.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.600
Going to school or a job where we do what is required of us to get by, but not necessarily

00:40.600 --> 00:42.120
more than that.

00:42.120 --> 00:46.780
Getting quick dopamine fixes throughout the day on our phones or other devices, spending

00:46.780 --> 00:51.080
weekends hanging out with the same people we've always socialized with, holding on

00:51.080 --> 00:55.960
to the same beliefs we had for years and failing to consider different opinions.

00:55.960 --> 00:58.920
Usually it means taking the path of least resistance.

00:58.920 --> 01:04.080
Life becomes a predictable routine with no real challenges and we find ourselves stagnating.

01:04.080 --> 01:08.880
And it's easy to understand why the majority of people stay here for most of their lives.

01:08.880 --> 01:13.240
As the name implies, it's comfortable here, since we're not pushing ourselves.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.340
At a first glance, there seems to be nothing wrong with that.

01:16.340 --> 01:21.280
Why would we voluntarily put ourselves in a position of struggle if we don't have to?

01:21.280 --> 01:25.360
But if we only live our lives in the comfort zone, we might be unknowingly doing ourselves

01:25.360 --> 01:27.000
an injustice.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.360
You see, while our comfort zone is indeed comfortable, it also has one big downside.

01:32.360 --> 01:36.480
People who are stuck here for too long don't just stagnate, but they often regress backwards

01:36.480 --> 01:37.640
as well.

01:37.640 --> 01:41.560
When you're doing the same things the same way, over and over, the comfort zone itself

01:41.560 --> 01:43.000
begins to shrink.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.800
The things that you were comfortable with before are now less comfortable.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.240
Let me give you an example.

01:49.240 --> 01:53.120
Someone who is socially anxious and is afraid of social interaction usually doesn't like

01:53.120 --> 01:55.240
the idea of meeting new people.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.200
Experiencing that is outside their comfort zone.

01:58.200 --> 02:02.000
So instead they prefer to spend their time alone, or if they do socialize, it's with

02:02.000 --> 02:04.480
people they already know well.

02:04.480 --> 02:05.840
And that's fine.

02:05.840 --> 02:09.400
But let's say this person starts spending less time with their current friends and even

02:09.400 --> 02:10.840
more time alone.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.520
Slowly, their current comfort zone will become smaller.

02:14.520 --> 02:18.320
Because they don't confront their fear, the fear becomes even bigger.

02:18.320 --> 02:22.960
And even the idea of calling up their current friend group might become more difficult.

02:22.960 --> 02:28.600
So you can see how paradoxically giving into current comfort can lead to future discomfort.

02:28.600 --> 02:33.360
When a muscle isn't used for a longer period of time, it atrophies and gets smaller because

02:33.360 --> 02:36.120
there is no reason for it to stay big.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.840
The same happens when we don't challenge ourselves.

02:38.840 --> 02:42.960
We become less capable of handling the obstacles that life throws at us.

02:42.960 --> 02:46.640
And that is the first reason why I try to do something difficult every day.

02:46.640 --> 02:50.040
I don't want to stagnate and I don't want the things that I'm comfortable with now

02:50.040 --> 02:52.720
become uncomfortable in the future.

02:52.720 --> 02:56.600
However, when we push ourselves and do something that is a little more difficult or challenging

02:56.600 --> 02:59.160
for us, we leave the comfort zone.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.560
Then we enter the growth zone.

03:01.560 --> 03:05.760
This is where we struggle and we might feel like incompetent fools, but this is exactly

03:05.760 --> 03:08.160
where all real progress is made.

03:08.160 --> 03:10.720
And you have probably noticed this yourself.

03:10.720 --> 03:15.320
When working out at the gym, you don't improve if you simply live the same weight every time.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.040
When learning a new language, you're not advancing if you only practice what you already

03:19.040 --> 03:20.040
know.

03:20.040 --> 03:25.060
To improve and see progress, you have to leave the comfort zone and increase the challenge.

03:25.060 --> 03:28.640
That might mean increasing the weights on your lifts or reading something new and trying

03:28.640 --> 03:30.800
to recall that information without help.

03:30.800 --> 03:36.080
Yes, it will be uncomfortable, yes, you will struggle, and yes, you will probably feel

03:36.080 --> 03:37.440
like an idiot.

03:37.440 --> 03:41.240
But doing anything worthwhile requires you to go through this because the things that

03:41.240 --> 03:44.720
have the biggest payoff always feel difficult in the moment.

03:44.720 --> 03:47.000
There's no improvement without challenge.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.880
Remember that.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.580
Of course, the comfort zone isn't just one single zone for everything.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.580
We have multiple zones.

03:54.580 --> 03:58.680
You might be pushing yourself in some of them, stagnating in others, and even deteriorating

03:58.680 --> 03:59.880
in some.

03:59.880 --> 04:04.480
For example, you could be regressing backwards with your social skills, stagnating with your

04:04.480 --> 04:07.880
work, but pushing yourself to the limit at the gym.

04:07.880 --> 04:11.440
It's up to each of us to identify which zone needs more work.

04:11.440 --> 04:15.120
And it's completely fine to stop progressing in some areas if you're happy with where

04:15.120 --> 04:16.280
you are.

04:16.280 --> 04:19.400
There is no need to push yourself at everything you do.

04:19.400 --> 04:23.480
But if you're not happy with where you are, there are a few ways to go from comfort to

04:23.480 --> 04:24.840
growth.

04:24.840 --> 04:29.040
You probably already have a certain area in mind where you're kind of stuck and want

04:29.040 --> 04:30.240
to improve.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.360
There are three ways to go about it.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.440
The first way is by doing it more consistently.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.440
The second way is by doing it more intensely.

04:38.440 --> 04:42.500
And lastly, the third way is by doing it for longer periods of time.

04:42.500 --> 04:46.380
All three of them will increase the difficulty of whatever you want to improve on.

04:46.380 --> 04:50.660
I think they're mostly self-explanatory, but I'll quickly go over them using running

04:50.660 --> 04:52.020
as an example.

04:52.020 --> 04:56.660
Firstly, doing it more consistently simply means that instead of running 3 days a week,

04:56.660 --> 04:58.860
you try to raise it to 4 days.

04:58.860 --> 05:01.940
Since you're doing it more often, it becomes more challenging.

05:01.940 --> 05:05.620
But this also helps consolidate the behavior and makes it more likely for you to do it

05:05.620 --> 05:07.220
in the future as well.

05:07.220 --> 05:11.220
Secondly, doing it more intensely means that you do a more potent version of what you

05:11.220 --> 05:12.380
usually do.

05:12.380 --> 05:17.020
This might mean trying something new, like running sprints or running up a hill.

05:17.020 --> 05:21.740
Basically instead of running at 60% of your capacity, you bump it to 90%.

05:21.740 --> 05:25.500
This also adds variety and actually makes the activity more fun because you're not

05:25.500 --> 05:27.820
doing the same thing every single time.

05:27.820 --> 05:32.380
Thirdly, doing it for longer periods simply means spending more time on it whenever you

05:32.380 --> 05:33.860
decide to do it.

05:33.860 --> 05:39.380
So if you usually go for a 20 minute run, you now try to do it for 30 minutes instead.

05:39.380 --> 05:43.220
Simply you push yourself and persevere through it just a little longer than you normally

05:43.220 --> 05:44.220
do.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.460
Simple as that.

05:45.460 --> 05:49.340
And all of this can be applied to pretty much any activity.

05:49.340 --> 05:50.700
Learning a new language?

05:50.700 --> 05:55.420
Do it daily, maybe even multiple times a day if possible, increase the time you spend learning

05:55.420 --> 06:01.300
by 15 minutes and use active recall along with spaced repetition to remember more.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.620
Trying to improve your social skills?

06:03.620 --> 06:07.900
Consistently put yourself into environments where social situations might occur, try saying

06:07.900 --> 06:13.260
an extra sentence each time you find yourself in one and be the one who invites people out.

06:13.260 --> 06:16.900
All of those three methods are a good way to move from comfort towards growth.

06:16.900 --> 06:20.940
But depending on the area you're working on, some of them are more useful.

06:20.940 --> 06:24.460
For example, if you're trying to learn an instrument, you will find that it's actually

06:24.460 --> 06:29.660
better to play every day for 10 minutes than it is to play once a week for 1 intense hour.

06:29.660 --> 06:33.340
Also you shouldn't necessarily use all three methods at the same time or it might be too

06:33.340 --> 06:35.420
much too fast.

06:35.420 --> 06:38.980
Instead you want to pick one and once you're ready, expand from there.

06:38.980 --> 06:41.700
But more on that later.

06:41.700 --> 06:46.140
Now as I mentioned, most of the gains in life come from short term discomfort.

06:46.140 --> 06:50.900
With that being said, if something is difficult, it doesn't automatically mean it's good.

06:50.900 --> 06:54.660
Breaking your leg might be uncomfortable but I don't know of any positive results that

06:54.660 --> 06:56.380
might have in the long term.

06:56.380 --> 07:01.660
The area you want to be uncomfortable in has to have some sort of a long term benefit.

07:01.660 --> 07:05.180
Eating something, for example, makes you feel stupid in the moment but because you

07:05.180 --> 07:08.780
absorb new concepts, you get smarter over time.

07:08.780 --> 07:12.940
Eating healthily and resisting sugar might be difficult but it is what allows you to

07:12.940 --> 07:16.260
get in and stay in good physical condition.

07:16.260 --> 07:20.180
Saving money instead of splurging on a new pair of shoes might be hard but if invested

07:20.180 --> 07:23.980
properly and given enough time, it will make you wealthier.

07:23.980 --> 07:27.420
So these types of areas are where you should actually push yourself.

07:27.420 --> 07:31.220
The ones with short term pain but long term gain.

07:31.220 --> 07:35.220
And that is the second reason why I try to do something difficult every day.

07:35.220 --> 07:38.780
Even though it might feel uncomfortable in the moment, I know that my behavior will pay

07:38.780 --> 07:40.180
off in the future.

07:40.180 --> 07:44.740
And only by entering the growth zone and pushing myself, am I able to reap those positive long

07:44.740 --> 07:46.180
term benefits.

07:46.180 --> 07:51.420
Okay then, so why don't more of us leave the comfort zone if it's clearly beneficial

07:51.420 --> 07:52.420
to do so?

07:52.420 --> 07:55.660
Well, that's because there's actually a third zone.

07:55.660 --> 07:59.420
If someone were to push themselves too far out of their comfort zone, they just might

07:59.420 --> 08:03.500
pass the growth zone and go straight into the danger zone.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.380
This is why we feel uncomfortable in the first place.

08:06.380 --> 08:09.260
There is such a thing as pushing yourself too far.

08:09.260 --> 08:12.940
After all, if you exercise too much, you might suffer an injury.

08:12.940 --> 08:16.100
If you work too much, you might experience burnout.

08:16.100 --> 08:20.700
And discomfort is actually a very useful alarm preventing you from getting hurt as such an

08:20.700 --> 08:23.540
injury would likely set you further back.

08:23.540 --> 08:27.100
So it makes perfect sense why most people stay in their comfort zones.

08:27.100 --> 08:30.140
They want to avoid the danger zone at all costs.

08:30.140 --> 08:33.860
But unfortunately, a lot of people, when they're looking to make a positive change in their

08:33.860 --> 08:36.820
life, go straight into the danger zone.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.540
One of my friends is like this.

08:38.540 --> 08:41.700
A few years ago, he wanted to improve his physical health.

08:41.700 --> 08:46.100
With newfound motivation, he joined the gym and made a commitment to lift weights 5 times

08:46.100 --> 08:47.100
a week.

08:47.100 --> 08:51.660
He also vowed to start a strict diet where he would reduce his caloric intake and cut

08:51.660 --> 08:52.660
out all sugar.

08:52.660 --> 08:57.060
But within one month, he was back to routinely sitting on the couch, watching Netflix and

08:57.060 --> 08:59.180
stuffing himself with cookies.

08:59.180 --> 09:02.500
Like most people, he took on too much too quickly.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.220
And this is a very common occurrence when trying to leave the comfort zone.

09:06.220 --> 09:10.060
However, failing to stick to a plan isn't even the worst part.

09:10.060 --> 09:13.740
The bigger issue people now have is that because they fail at keeping up with their

09:13.740 --> 09:18.780
high expectations, they also feed their belief that it's entirely impossible for them to

09:18.780 --> 09:20.300
change and grow.

09:20.300 --> 09:24.340
Because of that, they don't even bother trying to improve themselves in the future.

09:24.340 --> 09:28.220
In their mind, they're failures who shouldn't try again.

09:28.220 --> 09:30.140
So what's the solution here?

09:30.140 --> 09:34.900
How do we make getting out of the comfort zone easier so we can operate in the growth zone,

09:34.900 --> 09:37.500
but at the same time avoid the danger zone?

09:37.500 --> 09:41.060
Positive change requires moving beyond our comfort zone, yes.

09:41.060 --> 09:44.300
However, nowhere does it say all has to be done at once.

09:44.300 --> 09:50.060
A far more effective method is to go about it gradually in small and manageable increments.

09:50.060 --> 09:54.180
After all, if someone has been completely sedentary and wants to begin exercising, it

09:54.180 --> 09:58.900
doesn't make sense to start doing intense weightlifting for 2 hours 5 times a week.

09:58.900 --> 10:02.900
Their odds of success are far higher if they just begin with something they're actually

10:02.900 --> 10:09.580
capable of doing, like having a light gym session 3 times a week for 45 minutes.

10:09.580 --> 10:12.820
And only once they're able to maintain that, push further.

10:12.820 --> 10:17.420
Remember, if you aren't able to commit to a small change, how can you expect to commit

10:17.420 --> 10:19.140
to a big one?

10:19.140 --> 10:21.580
Just something to think about.

10:21.580 --> 10:27.380
Another benefit that comes from doing it gradually is that you create a positive feedback loop.

10:27.380 --> 10:30.880
Since you're actually able to do what you set out to do, you give yourself evidence

10:30.880 --> 10:33.300
that you can indeed improve and change.

10:33.300 --> 10:37.540
And this proof of progress, even if it's small, makes you feel really good and more

10:37.540 --> 10:39.620
confident in your abilities.

10:39.620 --> 10:44.820
This in turn fuels persistence to push through more challenges further down the path.

10:44.820 --> 10:48.780
Basically success starts to feed on itself and you keep pushing further out of the comfort

10:48.780 --> 10:49.780
zone.

10:49.780 --> 10:54.260
Also, when you get a positive feedback loop going in one area, it tends to slowly spread

10:54.260 --> 10:56.060
to other areas.

10:56.060 --> 10:59.700
And this is the third reason why I try to do something difficult every day.

10:59.700 --> 11:04.420
Whenever I'm able to do something outside my comfort zone, even if it's just by a little,

11:04.420 --> 11:07.180
it kick starts this positive feedback loop.

11:07.180 --> 11:12.660
And just like falling dominoes, success fuels further success.

11:12.660 --> 11:16.480
That being said, you shouldn't push past your comfort zone all the time.

11:16.480 --> 11:20.200
When I say I do something difficult every day, don't mistake this for me trying to

11:20.200 --> 11:23.560
expand in every single area on a daily basis.

11:23.560 --> 11:28.840
I might be pushing myself in one or two areas, but during that time I return back to the

11:28.840 --> 11:31.040
comfort zone in other areas.

11:31.040 --> 11:36.040
This allows me to maintain my current zone, but also get sufficient rest and recovery.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.520
Without rest, I would probably burn out.

11:38.520 --> 11:43.720
Yes, over time you want to grow, but you also want to give your comfort zone time to catch

11:43.720 --> 11:45.300
up to the new demands.

11:45.300 --> 11:48.700
This graph is a rough example of how I believe it should look like.

11:48.700 --> 11:52.140
First, you expand your comfort zone by doing something difficult.

11:52.140 --> 11:54.580
But you don't keep expanding indefinitely.

11:54.580 --> 11:59.380
Instead, when it starts feeling too overwhelming, you lower the difficulty and retract only

11:59.380 --> 12:02.580
slightly above what your comfort zone was before.

12:02.580 --> 12:06.100
This allows you to get used to the new layer and you let your comfort zone catch up to

12:06.100 --> 12:09.420
your new demands, which prevents you from burning out.

12:09.420 --> 12:12.580
Only once you've adapted to the new demands and you feel like you're ready to improve

12:12.580 --> 12:15.580
again, you push past your new comfort zone.

12:15.580 --> 12:19.900
Just like before, once you feel like it's too hard, you retract slightly above the previous

12:19.900 --> 12:20.900
point.

12:20.900 --> 12:24.700
Essentially, you're consistently challenging yourself, but also coming back for air when

12:24.700 --> 12:26.260
it gets too difficult.

12:26.260 --> 12:31.220
And you can repeat this process until you reach the level you want to be at.

12:31.220 --> 12:36.140
Another way to look at it is to think about the comfort zone as a place of temporary refuge,

12:36.140 --> 12:39.220
but not a permanent residence.

12:39.220 --> 12:43.300
As you can see, the point of this video isn't to overexert yourself until you can't go

12:43.300 --> 12:44.300
any further.

12:44.300 --> 12:49.060
Rather, I'm trying to convince you to find a worthy challenge in hopes of bettering yourself

12:49.060 --> 12:50.620
at things you care about.

12:50.620 --> 12:55.100
Unfortunately, a lot of people give up at the first taste of failure or discomfort and

12:55.100 --> 12:57.740
they never see what they're actually capable of.

12:57.740 --> 13:02.060
If you never push yourself to the limit, how can you know where your limit is?

13:02.060 --> 13:06.180
Only those who consistently push past their comfort zones and embrace the struggle are

13:06.180 --> 13:08.580
able to reach their true potential.

13:08.580 --> 13:12.860
So I encourage you to do something today that you find slightly more challenging.

13:12.860 --> 13:17.780
Read a few more pages, do a few extra reps at the gym, learn some new words, try to do

13:17.780 --> 13:25.220
something difficult today and I assure you that you'll become better than yesterday.

13:25.220 --> 13:30.460
