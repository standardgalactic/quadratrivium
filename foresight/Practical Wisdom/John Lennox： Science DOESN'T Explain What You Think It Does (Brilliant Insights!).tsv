0	3000	Let's take the first point where you said
3000	6440	science has explained how the universe came to be.
6440	7640	It hasn't.
7640	9840	And that was the surprise I found
9840	13040	in reading Hawking's more recent book.
13040	16400	I was quite amazed to read the following key sentence
16400	17240	in the book.
17240	18480	It goes like this.
18480	21480	Because there is a law like gravity,
21480	25480	the universe can and will create itself from nothing.
25480	28800	And that was the reason he gave for saying we don't need God.
28800	30760	But just think of the statement.
30760	33600	Because there is a law like gravity,
33600	35960	that is because there is something.
35960	38120	The universe will create itself from nothing.
38120	40320	That's a flat contradiction before you start.
49080	50200	Good evening, everybody.
50200	51880	How are you doing?
51880	52760	Good to see you.
52760	54960	Welcome to Westminster Chapel.
54960	58320	And to what I'm sure will be a really, really interesting
58320	61960	conference this evening, the Practical Wisdom Conference.
61960	63880	We're talking, of course, this evening
63880	67200	about faith in the age of science.
67200	71680	Very often in our era, many people, especially atheists,
71680	75080	have claimed that science effectively disproves God.
75080	77320	Well, someone who has been answering those atheists
77320	81040	directly for a number of years is, of course, John Lennox.
81040	83640	John is a well-known Christian thinker.
83640	85880	He is emeritus professor of mathematics
85880	89040	and the philosophy of science at the University of Oxford.
89040	91600	And I've had the privilege of interviewing
91600	93480	and bringing John into conversation
93480	96600	with many skeptics over many years.
96600	98520	Myself, my role here is that I've
98520	102160	been hosting conversations between skeptics and Christians
102160	103080	for a number of years.
103080	105480	In fact, over 15 years, some people
105480	107280	know me from The Unbelievable Show, which
107280	109840	I hosted for 17 years or more.
109840	111920	And I'm currently engaged in some new projects.
111920	114920	And I'll be excited to tell you about those as well a little
114920	116760	later on in the evening.
116760	119240	But really, you're here to obviously see and hear
119240	120880	from John Lennox.
120880	123640	So I'd like to invite both Samuel and John
123640	126040	to join me on stage as they begin this evening.
126040	127440	Do give them a round of applause.
127440	141880	Welcome everyone to Practical Wisdom,
141880	143480	and thank you very much for joining us.
143480	145800	My name is Samuel Maruska, and today we're
145800	149760	going to be talking about faith in God and science.
149760	152720	And there's no one better suited to have this conversation
152720	156040	with than Professor John Lennox.
156040	158120	John, it's great to have you with us.
158120	159600	Welcome to Practical Wisdom.
159600	162240	Well, thank you very much, Samuel.
162240	166400	Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming.
166400	169120	I'd just like to say how grateful I
169120	173320	am to Samuel and the team that have organized this,
173320	179560	because as Justin has just said, getting public discussion
179560	184640	on the big ideas is increasingly important
184640	188720	as our culture disintegrates by various influences that
188720	190760	come around.
190760	194320	Now, I want to encourage you to read Justin's book
194320	196520	afterwards, and I want to tell you
196520	201200	that Samuel is a formidable interviewer,
201200	203160	and that we have not colluded.
203160	205880	I don't know what he's going to ask me.
205880	208560	So I sit here in fear and trembling,
208560	211640	and look forward to the questions
211640	214120	that he's going to put to me.
214120	218760	John, you've engaged in many debates with intellectuals
218760	221240	and really heavyweight thinkers, people
221240	225080	like Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens,
225080	228120	and many other influential atheists.
228120	232440	Many people in this room will know you from these debates.
232440	236520	Can you talk a little bit about these debates?
236520	239600	Which one was one of the most remarkable one?
239600	243520	And also, what insights have you gained
243520	244560	from this experience?
247480	251320	I suppose one of the most remarkable ones,
251320	254200	and partly for a humorous reason,
254200	259320	was the debate with Professor Peter Singer, who's
259320	261520	one of the world's leading ethicists.
261520	266000	And I was invited to debate him on his home turf that
266000	268760	is in Melbourne City Hall some years ago,
268760	271000	although he teaches at Princeton.
271000	276160	And in the opening remarks, I'm always open with audiences
276160	279200	and point out that my parents were Christian.
279200	281440	And when he started, he said, well,
281440	285600	there goes my main objection against all religion.
285600	289880	People stay in the religion in which they were brought up.
289880	292120	And when I heard that, I thought,
292120	294720	this is going to be very interesting.
294720	298600	Because when I got a chance to speak, I said, Peter,
298600	302400	I told them about my parents.
302400	304040	Tell me about your parents.
304040	305880	Were they atheists?
305880	307680	Yes, he said they were atheists.
307680	313440	So I said, you stayed in the faith in which you grew up then.
313440	315960	Oh, but he said, it isn't a faith.
315960	317920	Oh, Peter, I said, I'm very sorry.
317920	319200	I thought you believed it.
322400	325920	And cyberspace went mad at that time
325920	329160	that here was one of the world's leading thinkers who
329160	334360	didn't realize that his atheism was a belief system.
334360	338160	And you notice how carefully Dr. Mariska Samuel
338160	339320	introduced this.
339320	341800	He talked about faith in God.
341800	344000	Because all people are people of faith.
344000	346560	Everybody's got a worldview that they believe.
346560	350400	And this really exposed one of the biggest problems
350400	352880	we have in our culture, that Christians
352880	354720	are regarded as people of faith.
354720	357320	That means they believe that there's no evidence.
357320	359200	But atheists, they're not people of faith.
359200	360680	They're rational.
360680	364000	And fighting against that is one of the things
364000	366320	I've been doing for a long time.
366320	369080	What have I learned from it?
369080	371600	That's hard to assess.
371600	374080	I've learned that it's pretty scary debating
374080	376720	some of these people, certainly that.
376720	382040	And also, it has confirmed my faith enormously.
382040	387040	Because spending a lot of time unpicking these arguments
387040	390360	as I grow older, I find them less and less intellectually
390360	391920	impressive.
391920	395400	But I think it's so important that we enter this debate,
395400	399880	or we have shows like Justin has been doing for years,
399880	402360	to allow people to see both sides of the debate.
402360	404680	I think that's a very healthy thing.
404680	408640	And it enables people to see that Christianity has actually
408640	412000	got very powerful evidence to support it.
412000	416040	And we need to know that evidence.
416040	418120	So you mentioned faith there.
418120	421200	And you obviously have very interesting ideas
421200	423600	on faith in God and science.
423600	425560	And the Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor
425560	427840	has this secularization theory.
427840	430080	And he wrote extensively about this.
430080	433800	And he said, in ancient times, people
433800	436520	needed God to explain supernatural things.
436520	440160	So for example, if you had a solar eclipse,
440160	442040	people in ancient times would think
442040	444840	that would be the wrath of God manifested.
444840	448240	But nowadays, that science has explained that.
448240	450080	We don't need God anymore.
450080	453280	So science has replaced God.
453280	454800	We know there's no mystery there.
454800	456640	We know how the planets move.
456640	459760	We can explain what happens during a solar eclipse.
459760	462720	And we can actually predict all of this next solar eclipse
462720	464360	for the next 1,000 years.
464360	466560	So science has replaced God.
466560	469400	This is part of the secularization theory.
469440	473360	And we live in a very secular society in the UK.
473360	477480	And also, there's this God of the Gaps view,
477480	483600	which says, and many atheists and thinkers will say,
483600	486920	look, Christians are a bit of a bit,
486920	489360	some perhaps more lazy thinkers.
489360	492360	Because if they can't explain something,
492360	494880	they just say, well, we can't explain it.
494880	496840	Therefore, God did it.
496880	500320	And this is the label that many atheists
500320	503040	would put on Christian thought.
503040	507200	What is your view on the God of the Gaps theory?
508360	511160	Well, it may apply to some people,
511160	513760	but I don't think it applies to me,
513760	514800	as I tried to explain,
514800	517800	but there are really two questions hidden there.
517800	521720	There's this notion that God and science
521720	524880	are alternatives in terms of explanation.
525760	527720	For a long time, I couldn't understand
527720	530920	why people as bright as Stephen Hawking
530920	532600	constantly said to the public,
532600	535600	you've got to choose between God and science.
535600	538720	And I realized for a long time
538720	541360	that part of the reason for that
541360	543360	was they didn't understand
543360	545640	the nature of scientific explanation.
545640	548360	Now, that may sound like a very arrogant claim
548360	551840	for me to make, but actually, it's quite simple.
552840	555840	We need to realize that the God explanation
555840	557280	and the science explanation
557280	559560	are different kinds of explanation.
559560	562440	And I often give a very simple example to illustrate it,
562440	565160	that even some professors can understand.
565160	569320	And it's this, why is the water boiling?
569320	571200	Well, because the heat energy
571200	574400	is agitating the molecules of water and is boiling.
575440	577960	Well, that's a scientific explanation,
577960	580480	but I could equally well say it's boiling
580520	582200	because I want a cup of tea.
583160	586360	Now, that is an agent, personal explanation.
586360	588240	Now, think about those two explanations,
588240	591560	they're different, but they do not compete,
591560	595160	they do not conflict, they complement each other.
595160	596800	And I often say to people,
596800	601800	the God explanation is the agent type explanation.
602320	607160	God is the explanation of why there is a universe at all
607160	610120	and why there are scientists there to study it.
610120	613800	He's not competing in that sense at all.
613800	617680	And we need both, as I find most school children can say.
617680	622680	The second thing is that many contemporary thinkers
623040	628040	have lost the idea of a God who's a transcendent creator
628720	631400	who upholds the universe.
631400	636400	And they think of God in terms of the Greek God of thunder.
637080	638920	They couldn't explain thunder, as you said,
639040	640720	to the postulated God.
640720	643720	It's very important to realize
643720	647240	that the God of the Bible is not in that category.
647240	651000	There's a brilliant writer in Oxford
651000	652720	at one stage, Werner Yeager,
652720	655840	who was an expert on the Greek gods and the Babylonian gods.
655840	659000	And he made this point, which I think is very important.
659000	662240	He said, all the gods of the ancient philosophies
662240	664680	and religions are, quote,
664680	667640	descended from the heavens and the earth.
667640	669320	That is they were actually part
669320	671840	of the original material cosmos.
671840	675880	The God of the Bible created the heavens and the earth.
675880	679580	So they're completely different categories.
679580	680640	Now, with that as background,
680640	683080	let me come to the heart of your question,
683080	685760	which is the God of the gaps.
685760	689480	Now, I'm allergic to this in the sense that
689480	691320	I do not want people to think
691320	693600	that I believe in a God of the gaps.
693600	696200	So how do I deal with it?
696200	697920	Well, in several different ways.
697920	699880	I'm going to go for the easiest one.
699880	704880	And it's this, that think of Isaac Newton
705320	708360	and his wonderful law of gravitation.
708360	711280	And I used to love explaining it to students
711280	714080	how you get an equation with eight symbols in it.
714080	715980	And from it, you could deduce the motion
715980	717600	of the planets around the sun.
717600	720520	It is just brilliant stuff.
720520	723400	Now, when Newton discovered that,
723400	728400	did he think, right, I have now got an equation
728880	732520	that allows me to deduce the motion
732520	734160	of the planets from it.
734160	737040	I don't need God.
737040	738200	No, he didn't.
738200	740760	He wrote what was perhaps the most brilliant book
740760	743680	in the history of science at Principia Mathematica.
743680	746960	And he dedicated it to with the hope
746960	751160	that thinking people would see in it evidence
751160	753400	for the existence of a divine intelligence
753400	756520	behind the universe, because his argument was this.
756520	761520	I found this wonderful mathematical description
761680	764520	of what goes on in between heavy bodies
764520	765560	and how they move.
765560	768520	What a brilliant God who did it that way.
768520	771560	And it's exactly that in the way we normally think.
771560	774120	If you know a lot about painting,
774120	777120	you will see much more in a Rembrandt picture than I would
777120	780920	who am pretty ignorant about art, although I like it.
780920	782400	You can see the genius.
782400	784720	If you're an engineer, you'll see much more
784720	788040	in a Rolls-Royce engine than I possibly would,
788040	791000	because you see the evidence.
791000	795120	And to my mind, God is not a God of the gaps.
795120	800120	He is the most powerful explanatory power
800360	804760	to make sense of the whole thing.
804760	806740	I'm a mathematician.
806740	809720	The very fact that we can do mathematics to me
809720	813280	is an indicator that this is a word-based universe
813280	814520	to put it that way.
814520	816720	The very fact that in biology,
816720	819960	we've discovered the longest word, the human genome,
819960	823680	3.4 billion letters in a chemical alphabet
823680	826820	is evidence of an intelligent mind.
826820	830620	That's not a mind of the gaps.
830620	832660	It's the only thing that makes sense.
832660	834180	Now, I'm looking around the room,
834180	835460	but the lights are blind to me.
835460	837380	Oh, yes, I see a word of their prayer.
837380	838660	How very suitable.
838660	840980	There are two, four, six letters.
840980	844260	The moment you see that, what do you deduce?
844260	846020	Well, you can see letters.
846020	848260	They have meaning to you.
848260	849820	You cannot explain that meaning
849820	851660	in terms of the physics and chemistry
851660	854580	of the paper and paint there.
854580	856660	But the moment you see that,
856660	858660	there are many mechanical processes
858660	861420	that went in producing that sign.
861420	864220	But you know, because that carries meaning,
864220	867740	it's a word that behind it, there was a mind.
868900	871540	Not a mind of the gaps,
871540	874260	but a mind that's the only sensible explanation
874260	875700	of what you're reading up there.
875700	878420	It's that kind of argument to my mind
878420	880940	that I find extremely convincing.
880940	883900	So you talked about meaning there and semantics,
883900	885660	and the word semantics,
885660	889420	there's Richard and Ogden published this book in 1923,
889420	892180	a hundred years ago, called The Meaning of Meaning.
892180	894860	And it's a very popular book.
894860	899340	And they talked about how language influences thought
899340	900620	and affects thought.
900620	904100	And they devised the semantic triangle,
904100	905820	which is a model of meaning,
905820	909180	which when you have the symbol or the sign,
909180	911540	linguistic sign on one side,
911540	916540	you have the actual thing in reality on the other side,
916740	918300	which is the reference,
918300	920460	and then you have at the top thought.
920460	924580	And it's the relation and the causal relation
924580	928100	and interactions of these three that give you meaning.
928100	931300	This book actually was very influential in philosophy
931300	933460	and also influenced C.S. Lewis
933460	937140	in The Abolition of Man, published in 1943,
937140	941420	in which he talked about objective moral standards
941420	943220	and also natural law.
943220	947580	So people and scientists sometimes say,
947580	951380	look, there's this universe out there
951380	956100	with millions of galaxies, with hundreds of thousands of stars,
956100	959860	and they all dance together in a very interesting,
959860	963900	in a beautiful rhythm because of the gravity law.
963900	966820	But there is no meaning to that.
966820	971700	And also, as a human being, which is, as humans,
971700	974140	this is a microcosm.
974140	976780	There's no meaning in our life either.
976780	979220	Does meaning imply intelligent design?
980340	984420	It's interesting that people should even say a thing like that.
984420	986980	There is no meaning in it.
986980	988740	And they expect me to understand
988740	990260	the meaning of that statement.
993300	996380	It's one of these incoherent things
996420	999180	that people make statements
999180	1004180	and they are unconsciously accepting themselves.
1004820	1007460	It's like, may I tell a little story?
1007460	1008300	Please do.
1008300	1012620	Sitting in my Oxford College beside a man who had a book
1012620	1016340	and he was putting it on the table.
1018020	1021300	And I could see its title was curious about semantics
1021300	1022140	and so on.
1022140	1023260	I said, what's your book about?
1023260	1025660	But he said, this is a book that shows
1025660	1029620	that there's no such thing as authorial intention.
1030540	1032260	I said, pardon?
1032260	1035180	I said, you mean if I read your book,
1035180	1039140	I will understand that an author has no intention.
1039140	1040340	He said, exactly.
1040340	1042140	So I said, I'm not gonna read it.
1043420	1044340	So he said, why not?
1044340	1047420	Well, I said, it must apply to your book as well.
1047420	1048580	But he never thought about it.
1048580	1049580	He got very angry.
1049580	1050700	He got up and walked out.
1050700	1052580	We never saw him again.
1052580	1057420	This is one of the weaknesses of this sort of loose,
1057420	1061420	postmodern style talk that says,
1061420	1062900	there's no such thing as truth,
1062900	1066140	but they expect you to believe that statement as a truth.
1066140	1067300	It goes too far.
1067300	1069460	It goes right over the top.
1069460	1071940	Now I'm very interested in the kind of way
1071940	1073420	in which you pose that question
1073420	1076780	because another person that influenced Lewis a lot,
1076780	1079340	one of his inklings was Barfield.
1079340	1082580	And Owen Barfield posed an interesting question.
1082580	1086940	He said, why is it we live in a world
1086940	1090980	where we understand how almost everything works
1090980	1093500	and we know the meaning of nothing?
1093500	1095900	Ed McGilchrist is a very interesting,
1095900	1098460	he's a polymath really, he's a neuroscientist.
1098460	1101180	But roughly speaking, he's been working
1101180	1103580	on something we're all familiar with.
1103580	1105980	When we say Jane, you know,
1105980	1109540	she's a real left-brained nerd,
1109540	1113460	always into computers and all this kind of thing.
1113460	1117540	Whereas James, well, he's so right-brained
1117540	1120620	with his head and arts and the clouds and so on.
1120620	1121820	Left and right brain.
1121820	1124180	Well, what Ian McGilchrist claims
1124180	1126500	in his very interesting book, which is called,
1126500	1128220	this is a very interesting title,
1128220	1131180	the matter with things,
1131180	1134620	is that there is substance to these differences
1134620	1137060	between the two brain hemispheres.
1137060	1141140	And roughly speaking, both brain hemispheres
1141140	1144020	are involved in virtually every event
1144020	1146340	in our brains and minds.
1146340	1150180	But the differences are that indeed,
1150180	1152980	there is this concentration in the left brain
1152980	1157060	on rational thought, on analysis, on breaking things down.
1157060	1159820	Whereas the right brain concerns itself much more
1159820	1163660	with putting things into context and meaning.
1163660	1167660	And he says this, for the last four or 500 years,
1167660	1170260	we have neglected the right brain.
1171180	1174060	So that we're living in a world
1174060	1176940	where we know how most things work,
1176940	1179180	but we understand the meaning of nothing.
1179180	1182900	And when our late chief rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, read that,
1182900	1185620	he had a light bulb moment and he wrote a book
1185620	1187220	because of it, a very interesting book
1187220	1188740	called The Great Partnership.
1188740	1191700	But he put it this way, and I like this formulation,
1191700	1192740	it's very helpful.
1192780	1197780	He said, science takes things apart to see how they work.
1198100	1201860	Religion puts them together to see what they mean.
1201860	1204700	And it seems to me that captures something
1204700	1208300	extremely important, that we need to focus
1208300	1210300	on the meaning side.
1210300	1213980	Because science is powerful precisely
1213980	1217300	because it limits the questions it can answer.
1217300	1221220	It cannot give us meaning and it cannot give us value.
1221260	1223220	Einstein saw that years ago.
1223220	1226860	He said you could talk about the ethical foundations
1226860	1229340	of science, but you cannot talk about
1229340	1231580	the scientific foundations of ethics.
1231580	1233380	You have to look outside.
1233380	1236100	And I always cite one of Richard Dawkins'
1236100	1238620	favorite scientists, Sir Peter Bedouin,
1238620	1241380	who said it's so easy to see.
1241380	1245260	And this is hugely important because science is so powerful.
1245260	1249140	It's so easy to see, he wrote, that science is limited
1249180	1252740	because it cannot even answer the simple question
1252740	1254180	of a child.
1254180	1255740	Where do I come from?
1255740	1258220	Where am I going and what is the meaning of life?
1258220	1263220	And to answer those questions, we need to go to literature
1263300	1266340	and I would add, well he added philosophy
1266340	1270060	and I would add theology and a lot of other things as well.
1270060	1275060	Because the fatal flaw in much so-called academic thinking
1275900	1278820	is that people have come to believe
1278820	1283420	that science is co-extensive with rationality,
1283420	1284820	which is nonsense.
1284820	1286740	History is a rational discipline.
1286740	1289500	So is theology, so is economics,
1289500	1291900	but they're not the natural sciences.
1291900	1295020	If science and rationality were co-extensive,
1295020	1297420	you'd have to close half the departments
1297420	1300180	in every university in the United Kingdom.
1300180	1302940	So that's how I'd begin to approach your question.
1302940	1305380	So science doesn't really explain the things
1305380	1307180	that we think it explains.
1307180	1308020	No, that's important.
1308020	1309260	It's very limited.
1310140	1313780	Yes, but what you're hinting at there is even deeper
1313780	1318260	because I used to think at school,
1318260	1320780	because I was pretty naive then I suppose,
1320780	1324340	that Newton's law of gravity explained gravity.
1324340	1326020	It doesn't, you know.
1326020	1328900	Nobody yet knows really what gravity is.
1328900	1331100	Newton's law of gravitation gives you
1332100	1335140	a mathematical capacity to calculate
1336140	1337980	what happens when heavy bodies move
1337980	1339500	in relation to one another,
1339500	1342860	so accurately that it'll help you land a person on the moon.
1342860	1345820	But Newton realized all those years ago
1345820	1349020	that it doesn't tell you what gravity is.
1349020	1352340	So even within science itself,
1352340	1356140	a scientific explanation is rarely,
1356140	1358980	if ever, a complete explanation.
1359860	1363300	I focused in the last several years
1363300	1365140	on the nature of explanation
1365140	1367900	because I feel there's huge confusion about it.
1369300	1373780	But science did explain how the universe came to be
1373780	1376180	and also it conflicts,
1376180	1380100	this conflicts with the Genesis account and creationism.
1380100	1384020	I think this is a very important issue for Christians
1384020	1387820	because science seems to have explained
1387820	1391060	and seems to go against creationism.
1391060	1393860	For example, some Christians say
1393860	1397340	that the earth is only 6,000 years old.
1397340	1399380	So science seems to have explained that
1399380	1402140	and contradict that irrefutably.
1402140	1405300	And then you also have statements in Genesis
1405300	1410300	that man was created in the image of God, Imago Dei.
1410300	1414340	And I think this is hugely important
1414380	1418300	because this is the cornerstone of our Western civilization.
1418300	1422220	Now Harari took this a step further
1422220	1425100	in his book, Homo Deus, and said two things.
1425100	1429060	One, we can enhance human life
1429060	1432020	by using data information and AI
1432020	1435460	very much based on Nietzsche's Ubermensch
1435460	1438020	from the 19th century.
1438020	1441580	And also the second point he made in his book was that
1441620	1444580	death is only a medical problem
1444580	1449100	and eventually science will help us overcome that as well.
1449100	1452540	So the question is two pronged, I guess, John.
1452540	1457540	One, does evolution and the general theory of evolution
1459580	1462620	go against creationism?
1462620	1465060	And also, what is your take?
1465060	1468140	What does the image of God mean to you?
1468140	1470300	It's actually a four pronged question
1470300	1474420	I've worked out listening to you, or five even.
1474420	1477340	Let's take the first point where you said
1477340	1480780	science has explained how the universe came to be.
1480780	1481980	It hasn't.
1481980	1484180	And that was the surprise I found
1484180	1487380	in reading Hawking's more recent book.
1487380	1490740	I was quite amazed to read the following key sentence
1490740	1491580	in the book.
1491580	1495820	It goes like this, because there is a law like gravity,
1495820	1499820	the universe can and will create itself from nothing.
1499820	1502060	And that was the reason he gave for saying
1502060	1505060	we don't need God, but just think of the statement.
1505060	1507900	Because there is a law like gravity,
1507900	1510300	that is because there is something.
1510300	1512460	The universe will create itself from nothing.
1512460	1515100	That's a flat contradiction before you start.
1515100	1516660	But do scientists mean the same thing?
1516660	1519580	For me, nothing means the absence of something.
1519580	1521300	Do scientists mean the same thing?
1521300	1524500	No, they have to redefine nothing
1524500	1527260	as a quantum vacuum or something like this.
1527300	1532060	And then they get into incredible complexities.
1532060	1534300	I've written a book about this, by the way,
1534300	1536460	called Seven Days and Divide the World.
1536460	1538780	But let's just come back to the statement.
1538780	1540780	Because it's worse than that.
1540780	1543100	He says the universe will create itself.
1543100	1544660	What on earth could that mean?
1544660	1546420	Sorry, I didn't mean to put the earth in,
1546420	1547660	because that's the point.
1548860	1552740	The universe, if I say X creates Y,
1552740	1555020	roughly speaking, you would understand me to mean
1555020	1557340	if you've got X, you'll get Y.
1557340	1561180	If I say X creates X, I think what that tells me
1561180	1563300	is that nonsense remains nonsense,
1563300	1564980	even if scientists write it.
1565940	1568940	And as C.S. Lewis himself pointed out.
1568940	1572020	So number one point in response to you.
1572900	1575860	I don't believe science has told us
1575860	1578420	how the universe came to be.
1578420	1581100	It is certain theories of the etiology
1581100	1583380	of the history of space-time.
1583380	1586100	And as you say, a long time ago.
1586100	1588180	So let's come up a little bit.
1588180	1592020	Second point you mentioned was age of the earth
1592020	1592980	and creationism.
1592980	1594540	Now I must make a confession.
1595580	1597340	Because a few weeks ago,
1597340	1601260	I was speaking at the speech day in my own school,
1601260	1606140	founded in 1608 by Archbishop Usher,
1606140	1610980	who famously calculated the creation of Adam
1610980	1612460	at nine o'clock in the morning
1612460	1615860	on the 6th of October, 4004 B.C.
1615860	1617140	And wrote this in a letter
1617140	1619780	to the Vice Chancellor of Cambridge University
1619780	1621260	and said, sir, I'm sorry,
1621260	1624700	I cannot give it more precisely than that.
1624700	1627940	And as I spoke in the speech day,
1627940	1631500	sitting beside me was the current Archbishop.
1631500	1632940	So I turned to him and I said,
1632940	1635620	you know, you like Archbishop Usher,
1635620	1636980	or both historians.
1636980	1639100	And Usher was actually a good historian.
1639100	1641740	But I suspect, I said, Archbishop,
1641740	1645700	that you differ by about seven orders of magnitude
1645700	1648500	in your calculation of the age of the earth.
1648500	1652540	And then I used that to speak to the kids at school
1652540	1654180	and their parents.
1654180	1656020	And I said one or two things,
1656020	1658780	but not what I'm about to say to you.
1658780	1662380	Now the word creationism,
1662380	1666500	creationists used to mean a person like me
1666500	1668860	who believes in a creator.
1668860	1671260	Now it has been narrowed semantically
1671260	1676260	to being a person who believes in a young earth theory.
1677260	1680820	Now, let me just hit this head on
1680820	1682740	and give you one or two arguments
1682740	1685540	why I'm not convinced of that.
1685540	1687020	And I'm not convinced of it,
1687020	1689860	mainly for biblical reasons.
1689860	1691340	Let me explain.
1691340	1694940	In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
1694940	1696740	That's how Genesis starts.
1696740	1699900	You then get a sequence of days,
1699900	1704100	the six days of creation and God rest Sabbath.
1704100	1707420	The interesting thing about that text in Hebrew
1707420	1709540	is that the opening statement
1709540	1712300	is in one past tense in Hebrew
1712300	1716060	and it changes for the sequence of six days.
1716060	1717540	Now, in order to be fair,
1717540	1720420	I consulted the professor of Hebrew at Oxford
1720420	1723020	and the professor at Hebrew in Cambridge.
1723020	1725820	And to my amazement, they give me the same answer.
1726740	1729700	And it's best expressed, I suppose, by Jack Collins,
1729700	1733740	who was the lead Hebrew translator of the ESV,
1733740	1736860	also a trained scientist, which is interesting.
1736860	1738580	And I wrote to him about this
1738580	1740100	and I quote more or less,
1740100	1742700	I don't have it exactly in my memory.
1742700	1747660	He said, this tells you that the first statement
1747660	1749940	in the Bible occurs, quote,
1749940	1754420	at an indefinite period before the second group.
1754420	1757060	So what does the Bible say about the edge of the universe?
1757060	1758940	Absolutely nothing.
1758940	1761860	No matter what you believe about the days,
1761860	1764180	that is the interesting thing.
1764180	1765980	Now, I couldn't speak about the days,
1765980	1767660	but it would take too long.
1767660	1770860	But in order to satisfy people's curiosity,
1770860	1773140	I have a book, Revised Addition,
1773140	1775260	Seven Days that Divide the World.
1775260	1777580	Let me come to your last point.
1777580	1779480	The theory of evolution.
1779480	1782180	Well, there are many theories of evolution.
1782180	1786300	And biological evolution, as usually understood
1786300	1788580	by people like Richard Dawkins,
1788580	1791660	is that, and I'm partly quoting here,
1791660	1795740	natural selection, the blind automatic process
1795740	1798540	that Darwin discovered is the explanation
1798540	1802020	for the existence and variation of all of life.
1802020	1804300	That's a quotation from the blind watchmaker,
1804300	1806580	one of his most famous books.
1806580	1809780	Well, the first statement is false.
1809780	1812340	And he took many years to admit it.
1812340	1814740	Evolution, natural selection,
1814740	1817340	cannot account for the existence of life
1817340	1819660	for the most simple of reasons.
1819660	1823060	That natural selection, in order to do anything at all,
1823060	1826820	depends on the existence of life, to begin with.
1826820	1829740	So we can't explain it, full stop.
1829740	1833540	The origin of life does not come in
1833540	1835860	to the mandate of biological evolution,
1835860	1838220	as normally understood, unless you start to talk
1838220	1841300	about chemical evolution, which is completely different,
1841300	1845140	and there's nothing to do with selective processes.
1845140	1847540	And there's a lot to be said about that.
1847540	1851760	Secondly, neo-Darwinism, as it now is,
1851760	1856340	the neo adds the mechanism they believe, selection,
1856340	1859740	but these minor changes caused by mutation.
1859740	1863980	Now, number one, it's obvious that selection
1863980	1865660	and mutation do something.
1865660	1867740	Just have a look around this room.
1867740	1869460	Do we all look the same?
1869460	1870660	No.
1870660	1871500	Why?
1871500	1873260	Because there was selection.
1873260	1875300	I bet some of you did some selecting.
1875300	1879740	I did when I saw the lady that became my wife,
1879740	1883500	and I selected her, and marvelously, she selected me.
1883500	1885700	And that's why our children look like they do,
1885700	1887900	but they're different from everybody else.
1887900	1890900	Selection and mutation do something.
1890900	1893420	And from a Christian perspective,
1893420	1897380	we must see that that is something God has built
1897420	1898420	into the world.
1898420	1902180	As Paul pointed out to the Athenian philosophers,
1902180	1906180	God has made of one every race of human beings.
1906180	1910100	So that's okay, and what Darwin observed,
1910100	1912060	brilliantly observed, actually,
1912060	1915420	were minor variations on the theme.
1915420	1917340	But now comes the problem.
1917340	1921460	Does this selection and mutation mechanism
1921460	1923900	explain all the variation?
1923900	1926100	It is nothing to do with the origin of life,
1926100	1928260	but does it really explain,
1928260	1930700	does it do the work that's claimed of it?
1930700	1932220	Now, I'm very interested in this.
1932220	1936620	I'm not a biologist, but I have lived and soaked my mind
1936620	1939980	in biology for the last many years.
1939980	1942300	And I've got a friend in Oxford
1942300	1944500	who is an absolutely brilliant fellow
1944500	1948300	in the Royal Society, Professor Dennis Noble.
1948300	1951900	And he is really the driving force
1951900	1955660	behind what's called the third wave in biology.
1955660	1957980	And what are they saying now?
1957980	1962980	They're saying that neo-Darwinism is not fit for purpose.
1963780	1966220	It doesn't need to be modified.
1966220	1969480	It needs to be replaced.
1969480	1972060	The wheels are coming off this stuff,
1972060	1974180	but people don't know it,
1974180	1976460	which is why I've written just recently
1976460	1978940	a major book on this to try to introduce,
1978940	1981260	particularly to Christians, but not only.
1981260	1984620	What is going on at the top level in science?
1984620	1987020	The book is called Cosmic Chemistry,
1987020	1988940	Do God and Science Mix?
1988940	1991660	Now, don't misunderstand these people.
1991660	1994100	Many of them feel still
1994100	1997940	that there's going to be a naturalistic solution.
1997940	2001060	In other words, a solution that doesn't involve
2001060	2003940	a divine input of any kind,
2003940	2006980	but they're being much more honest now.
2006980	2011340	And the reason is that the levels of information
2011340	2015020	that we know to have been contained in the DNA,
2015020	2018100	the human genome, are now discovered
2018100	2021300	as only a small part of what's going on.
2021300	2026300	And the huge problem is that DNA and all these proteins
2027140	2030700	are dependent on the existence of the cell,
2030700	2033180	but the cell is dependent on them.
2033180	2037420	So you get a classic chicken and egg situation,
2037420	2039380	to which there's been no solution.
2039380	2041700	And now scientists are thinking much more
2041700	2043180	in terms of the cell.
2043180	2047900	And the cell is an absolutely unbelievably bewildering
2047900	2052100	complex of factories, microminature.
2052100	2056220	Now, it's not the fact that they contain information
2056220	2057220	that's the problem.
2057220	2059780	It's the nature of the information.
2059780	2062100	And really, it goes back to this.
2062100	2066580	The moment you see that, and it's only six letters,
2066580	2068340	you know there's a mind behind it.
2069300	2073180	So what I am suggesting is that within biology,
2073180	2075900	the evidence is mounting more and more
2075900	2078980	that there are many physical mechanisms involved.
2078980	2079820	Of course there are.
2079820	2081020	There's a big planet.
2081020	2084580	Life is extremely sophisticated once you get it going.
2084580	2086940	And clearly there are variations,
2086940	2090940	but when it comes to the existence of life itself
2090940	2093140	and all the major modifications,
2093140	2096900	it seems to me that there is increasing evidence
2096900	2101780	that you've got to factor in an intelligent mind
2101780	2104540	in order to get a full explanation.
2104540	2106300	Now, I know that's an assertion,
2106300	2108220	but I've tried to argue the case
2108220	2110380	and I put it out there in the public space.
2110380	2113020	So what you're saying, John, is that science
2113020	2116940	is not the only way to truth, which is actually scientism.
2116940	2120980	But on the flip side, we have fideism.
2120980	2124180	And Kirkegaard, the Danish philosopher,
2124180	2127060	was one of the proponents of this view.
2127060	2132060	And the Bible has a very interesting definition for faith
2132260	2134820	in Hebrews 11 and one,
2134820	2139820	which is an assurance about what we do not see.
2140460	2142100	And that's very interesting
2142100	2147100	because many atheists would say all faith is blind faith.
2147700	2150420	And also some Christians will say,
2150420	2155420	we do not enter into the kingdom of heaven by logic.
2155580	2157580	We do that by faith.
2157580	2162580	So the question is, what do you make of Dawkins' statement?
2164780	2168540	You quote Dawkins in your book, God's Undertaker.
2168540	2170380	And Richard Dawkins says this.
2171580	2173660	It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic
2173660	2177380	about the threat to humanity posed by the AIDS virus,
2177380	2179780	Matt Cowdy's disease and many others.
2179820	2181660	But I think that a case can be made
2181660	2185820	that faith is one of the world's great evils,
2185820	2190380	comparable to the smallpox virus, but how did he eradicate?
2190380	2194260	Faith, being belief that isn't based on evidence,
2194260	2197540	is the principal vice of any religion.
2197540	2199860	Is all faith blind faith?
2199860	2201620	Well, no, and I haven't forgotten
2201620	2203300	what you asked me about Harari.
2203300	2205140	I'll come back to that if I may.
2206140	2211140	Dawkins and his co-beligerents
2212180	2217180	have cleverly redefined faith and confused many people.
2217220	2219220	What he is defining as faith
2219220	2222420	is what most people call blind faith.
2222420	2224340	That is simply believing something
2224340	2225940	where there's no evidence.
2225940	2228940	Now, other religions must speak for themselves
2228940	2233820	and philosophies, but as far as Christianity is concerned,
2233860	2237500	scripture makes it abundantly clear
2237500	2242060	that the faith that Jesus and the apostles talk about
2242060	2244700	is evidence-based faith.
2244700	2246860	Now, you all know what that means.
2246860	2250060	If I asked you why you trusted certain people,
2250060	2251740	you'd say, well, because of this and this,
2251740	2253940	that is you give me evidence.
2253940	2256540	Why do you believe those facts
2256540	2258300	because of this and that evidence?
2258300	2260140	That's the common way to react
2260140	2261940	because believing without evidence
2262060	2264140	is a very risky thing to do.
2264140	2266900	But let's absolutely anchor this
2266900	2269380	because it is central.
2269380	2273740	John in his gospel explains why he wrote it.
2273740	2278020	And he says at the end, he says, many other signs,
2278020	2281900	the Greek term is semi-on, from which we get semiotics.
2281900	2284900	They're indicators of who Jesus was,
2284900	2286860	what we call his miracles.
2286860	2290420	Many other signs Jesus did in the presence of his disciples
2290420	2293340	which are not written in this book.
2293340	2298340	But these are written in order that you might believe
2298500	2302820	that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God,
2302820	2305420	and that believing you might have life in his name.
2305420	2308100	Now, notice very carefully what that says.
2308100	2310900	These are written that you might believe.
2310900	2315900	This is a basis, a set of evidences
2316580	2319820	on which you can ground your trust.
2320420	2323420	And your trust that Jesus is two things,
2323420	2327700	one, Hamashiach the Messiah, two, the Son of God,
2327700	2330420	and then on the basis of that,
2330420	2335260	you can have an experience of trusting him
2335260	2338980	which will bring you up to eternal life
2338980	2343300	as a gift from God on repentance and faith in him.
2343300	2346820	Now, that to my mind is crucially important.
2346860	2349860	Now, you mentioned sight,
2349860	2353060	and this is a very interesting thing.
2353060	2355500	We have a philosopher quite well known
2355500	2358660	called A.C. Grayling in this country.
2358660	2360220	And he was invited to do,
2360220	2363780	I think it was a guest editorial in New Scientist.
2363780	2367740	And he chose to point out in his article
2367740	2370460	that Jesus requires blind faith.
2370460	2372700	And I got the New Scientist at that time
2372700	2374900	and I thought this is gonna be very interesting.
2374900	2377380	So here I read, how does he prove
2377380	2379460	that Jesus requires blind faith?
2379460	2384460	Well, he goes to John 20 and relates the story of Thomas.
2384460	2389180	And he quotes the description where Jesus says to Thomas,
2389180	2393980	because you have seen, you have believed.
2393980	2396700	But happy or blessed are those rather
2396700	2399060	who have not seen and have believed.
2399060	2400300	And there you are, he says,
2400300	2403420	Jesus asked you to believe without evidence.
2403420	2406140	My reaction to that was, can the man not read?
2407620	2409740	Jesus didn't say blessed are those
2409740	2412260	that have no evidence and believe.
2412260	2415580	He said blessed are those that haven't seen.
2415580	2417620	I've never seen Jesus.
2417620	2420180	And nor have you, I suspect.
2420180	2421300	And why do we believe?
2421300	2422260	Have we no evidence?
2422260	2424180	We've got masses of evidence.
2424180	2427460	It's just we don't have the physical evidence
2427460	2429460	of seeing that Thomas had.
2429460	2432460	But seeing is only one of our five senses.
2432460	2435300	And there are all kinds of other evidences,
2435300	2438380	both physical evidences, historical, experimental,
2438380	2439540	and all the rest of it.
2439540	2440980	And this is incredible.
2440980	2443220	And it was even more incredible
2443220	2445820	because if he'd read the next few verses,
2445820	2447900	he would have come across what I quoted to you
2447900	2449380	two minutes ago.
2449380	2452420	These signs are written that you might believe.
2452420	2456420	It contradicts exactly how our brilliant philosopher
2456420	2458740	seems to understand scripture,
2458740	2462220	which shows to me something very serious.
2462220	2465460	That some of our atheist friends and colleagues
2465460	2468700	will not take evidence seriously.
2468700	2470540	Because they've made up their minds
2470540	2471820	that if it's Christian,
2471820	2474740	it's faith and faith is believing where you can't see.
2474740	2477100	A. C. Grayling wrote a very good book
2477100	2479220	about Wittgenstein, the philosopher.
2479220	2482900	But Wittgenstein said that you cannot explain
2482900	2485180	a system from within the system.
2485180	2488180	You need someone from outside the system
2488180	2489980	in order to be able to explain it.
2489980	2493540	Yes, Wittgenstein's statement is extremely important.
2493540	2497380	And in fact, Jonathan Sacks takes that up in his book.
2497380	2499660	But it must be fair to your question, Samuel,
2499660	2502580	and come back to Harari and the future
2502580	2505180	because it's actually important.
2505180	2508060	You mentioned his two agenda items
2508060	2511060	that are one, to solve the problem of physical death,
2511060	2518060	and two, to enhance human abilities and capacities
2518060	2521260	and essentially produce a superintelligence.
2521260	2524220	This is what's known as transhumanism.
2524220	2526700	And in my own University of Oxford,
2526700	2528620	they are driving this forward.
2528620	2531020	There are millions of dollars being put
2531020	2533500	into this area of research, by the way.
2533500	2535460	This is big stuff.
2535460	2539460	And artificial intelligence is very much a part of it.
2539460	2542060	Now, we could go into details, but I'm not going to
2542060	2545660	because I've actually written a book about it called 2084,
2545660	2548780	Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humanity.
2548780	2550940	But I will comment on these two things
2550940	2553060	because they fascinate me.
2553060	2555860	Because when people come to me and tell me
2555860	2557340	about this wonderful agenda,
2557340	2559740	we're going to solve the problem of physical death,
2559740	2562900	and we're going to enhance human intelligence
2562900	2565860	and give people some form of eternal life,
2565860	2568500	possibly upload their brains onto silicon
2568500	2571180	so that they won't be dependent on biology,
2571180	2574380	which perishes and dies and all this kind of thing.
2574380	2577700	I simply look at them and say, you're too late.
2577700	2579180	And they say, what do you mean you're too late?
2579180	2581060	Well, I said the problem of physical death
2581060	2583140	was solved 20 centuries ago
2583140	2585500	when God raised Jesus from the dead.
2586460	2588540	And that proves that death isn't the end,
2588540	2591420	but it's also solved your other desire.
2591420	2595300	Because Jesus raised from the dead is the Son of God,
2595300	2597260	and he was raised from the dead because he died.
2597260	2599060	Why did he die?
2599060	2602980	He died so that there would be a basis for God
2602980	2605900	to forgive us for the mess we've made of our own lives
2605900	2607620	and those of other people.
2607620	2611300	And if we trust him as Savior and Lord,
2611300	2614820	he promises that he's going to upload us,
2614820	2618100	not simply our brains or our mental capacities,
2618100	2621060	but there's going to be a physical resurrection
2621060	2622580	in the last day.
2622580	2625980	And I said, I'll go for that rather than transhumanism
2625980	2629180	because I think there's much more evidence to back it up.
2629180	2633460	So they're too late, but they need to hear that message
2633460	2635220	because they're not getting it,
2635220	2637540	not at all as far as I can see.
2637540	2639140	I think the resurrection, as you say,
2639140	2641500	is hugely important for Christians.
2641500	2643180	And that's a miracle.
2643180	2648180	And again, David Hume said that in ancient times,
2648340	2650860	and in the past, people would believe the miracles
2650860	2654020	because they didn't have a good understanding.
2654020	2656860	They didn't understand natural laws,
2656860	2659980	which is, I'm not sure if you agree with that,
2659980	2664980	but he also said that miracles are a violation
2665020	2666940	of natural law.
2666940	2669380	So what is your take on that?
2669380	2674220	And also, what evidence is there
2674220	2677580	for the miracles and the resurrection?
2677580	2680140	Well, my ancestry is Scottish,
2680140	2684340	so far from me to criticize a Scotsman like David Hume,
2684340	2686100	but he was wrong.
2686100	2691100	And I say that not because I'm a Hume expert,
2691860	2694820	but the most famous Hume expert that I ever met
2694820	2697540	was Anthony Flu, the philosopher,
2697540	2700740	who all his life, championed atheism,
2700740	2702140	like Richard Dawkins did,
2702140	2707140	until he came to see that the cell and human DNA
2708860	2712860	was a code and it spoke of intelligence.
2712860	2715220	And I had an interview with him,
2715220	2717220	not long before he died, and I asked him,
2717220	2719780	I said, what about David Hume and miracles?
2719780	2720980	He said, I was wrong,
2720980	2723140	and he made one of the most humble statements
2723140	2725740	I've ever heard from an academic.
2725740	2728420	He said, my books were wrong,
2728420	2729780	I'd have to rewrite them,
2729780	2731740	and I'm never going to have the chance.
2731740	2733460	But let's come to the substance of it,
2733460	2735460	that's just a little story.
2735460	2738140	Miracles violations of the laws of nature,
2738140	2741100	that's where the confusion lies.
2741100	2746100	Law has two meanings for most of us.
2746220	2749260	They're the laws of nature, what are they?
2749260	2752740	They are our descriptions of the mathematics,
2752740	2755240	of what normally happens.
2755240	2759700	The apple dropped, falls towards the center of the earth,
2759700	2761460	as Newton pointed out.
2761460	2766340	The planets revolve around the sun in elliptical axes.
2766340	2768500	But then there are those that say,
2768500	2772060	you must not drive in inner London
2772060	2775340	without paying a congestion charge.
2775340	2778700	And if you don't pay it, you're going to get clobbered.
2778700	2780420	That's a different kind of law.
2780420	2782140	They get totally confused.
2782140	2785620	Now Lewis, as usual, in his wonderful genius,
2785620	2788020	he went right to the heart of this,
2788020	2789700	in a most brilliant book,
2789700	2791580	which most people don't read
2791580	2793940	because they get stuck in the third or fourth chapter,
2793940	2795340	which is quite difficult.
2795340	2798140	They should leave it out and go to the next chapter.
2798140	2800740	But Lewis tells this illustration.
2800740	2803940	Here I am, I stay in London overnight,
2803940	2807420	and I put 50 pounds in the drawer, night one.
2807420	2811660	Night two, I put another 50 in, so that's 100 pounds.
2812740	2815740	I'm leaving on day three, I get up in the morning,
2815740	2819460	and I find a 10-pound note in the drawer.
2819460	2821220	So what do I conclude?
2821220	2823220	That the laws of arithmetic have been broken
2823220	2824460	or the laws of England?
2824980	2828500	Well, you're nothing, because you see,
2828500	2831340	I conclude the laws of England have been broken.
2831340	2832820	How do I know that?
2832820	2835860	Because the laws of arithmetic have not been broken.
2837340	2838180	You see?
2839300	2842300	It's the fact that the laws of arithmetic hold
2842300	2845940	that tell me that somebody's put their hand in
2847140	2850940	to what I thought was a closed system of cause and effect,
2850940	2852540	but it turned out not to be,
2852540	2855140	so a thief could put their hand in.
2855140	2857980	So that has helped me enormously,
2857980	2862140	because it really knocks you right out of the ballpark.
2863140	2866660	It shows that the confusion lies in the nature
2866660	2869140	of our concept of law.
2869140	2872140	The laws of nature are not like the laws of England.
2872140	2875340	Now here's the slightly ironic thing.
2875340	2877300	In order to recognize a miracle,
2877300	2879460	and the word miracle is slightly unfortunate,
2879460	2882540	because it's Latin, miraculum is a wonder.
2882540	2886060	What we're talking about is supernatural events
2886060	2889340	that give evidence that there is a supernatural.
2889340	2892660	Not everything that claims to be a miracle is one.
2892660	2896380	If I say it's a miracle that Jim passed his exam,
2896380	2898980	that isn't necessarily supernatural.
2898980	2900740	It's because he was a silly nitwit
2900740	2902380	and didn't do any work.
2902380	2903220	You see?
2903220	2905700	So we need to focus,
2905700	2908100	and that's why I focus on the resurrection.
2908100	2911660	This is the central claim that Jesus rose.
2911660	2913060	It's supernatural.
2913060	2915300	It's not simply that Jesus rose
2915300	2917460	as if it came from inside the grave.
2917460	2920060	It's God raised him from the dead.
2921580	2924500	It's power coming in from outside.
2924500	2926180	Now take a simple analogy.
2926180	2928860	If I pick this up and drop it,
2928860	2930900	the law of gravitation will tell me
2930900	2932900	it falls towards the center of the earth.
2932900	2935780	That will not stop Samuel catching it.
2935780	2938060	He can intervene and stop it.
2938100	2940340	And it doesn't break the law of gravity.
2940340	2945020	It changes the configuration of the situation.
2945020	2948180	So at the larger level,
2948180	2953100	God created a universe with regularities in it.
2953100	2955380	If he hadn't done it that way,
2955380	2959300	you wouldn't have been able to recognize a miracle
2959300	2960740	if you saw one.
2960740	2965060	If we didn't know the dead bodies normally remain dead,
2965060	2968140	we wouldn't be the least bit surprised by resurrection.
2968140	2969780	And the interesting thing is,
2969780	2972220	it answers another thing of Hume's.
2972220	2976020	Hume said, and you put it in your introduction
2976020	2977900	to the question that in those days,
2977900	2981980	people didn't know the laws of nature, didn't they?
2981980	2984540	When Joseph was told by his fiance
2984540	2986380	that she was pregnant,
2986380	2988580	he didn't know where babies came from, did he?
2988580	2989620	So he believed her.
2989620	2991860	No, he didn't, because he knew exactly
2991860	2993420	where they came from.
2993420	2996940	And we read that because he was a righteous man,
2996940	2998660	he wanted to divorce her quietly.
2998660	3001260	He didn't want to expose her to public
3001260	3004420	because he knew exactly what the law of nature was.
3004420	3007820	And it took a special intervention of God
3007820	3009940	speaking to that man and saying,
3009940	3012100	Joseph, this is okay.
3012100	3014060	This is holy.
3014060	3015980	I'm behind this.
3015980	3018260	The man born blind in John 9,
3018260	3019460	it's a wonderful story.
3019460	3021540	It's actually a humorous story.
3021540	3023500	They said to him, well,
3023500	3024940	you weren't the man who was blind
3024940	3026500	or you weren't born blind, all this.
3026500	3029020	And he said, look, let's cut all this out.
3029020	3030500	Since the beginning of the world,
3030500	3032980	it's never been heard that someone born blind
3032980	3034500	has received their sight.
3034500	3036780	So what has happened to me is unique.
3036780	3038580	It must be supernatural.
3038580	3041020	Of course they knew the laws of nature.
3041020	3044340	And therefore, Hume was wrong on both those counts.
3044340	3048860	So John, I want to come to the issue of the wording
3048860	3050380	and the definition of apologetics
3050380	3053220	because that's exactly what apologetics does,
3053220	3055140	just what you did just now,
3055140	3059540	explaining miracles and explaining the rationality of faith.
3059540	3063700	But apologetics has nothing to do with being apologetic.
3063700	3065740	It comes from the Greek word apologia,
3065740	3068660	which means giving a defense of something.
3068660	3069500	But at the same time,
3069500	3072900	the second point I want to make, John, is this.
3072900	3076540	Apologetics seems to explain things,
3076540	3079620	but does that limit Christianity
3079620	3084220	to only the things that we can demonstrate
3084220	3086780	and explain apologetically?
3086780	3088700	So what is apologetics
3088700	3091380	and what are the limits of apologetics?
3091380	3094860	Well, as you say, apologia is defense.
3094860	3097180	But it's interesting if you do a word search
3097180	3099620	to see where it's used in the New Testament,
3099620	3104620	and it's mostly used by or about Paul.
3104860	3108380	And his number one apologia defense is,
3108380	3110740	I was on the Damascus Road
3110740	3114380	and I met the risen Christ and he completely changed my life.
3114380	3116820	That was his main apologetic.
3116820	3118300	And that's why I don't like the word
3118300	3120100	because it sounds like an apology.
3120100	3121900	We should have translated it.
3121900	3123820	All we did was take it straight out of Greek
3123820	3125700	and transliterated it.
3125700	3126780	But it's much better.
3126780	3130500	I think Peter May's explanation of it is the best.
3130500	3132740	It's persuasive evangelism.
3132740	3135660	And the most persuasive thing about your experience
3135660	3137300	if you're a Christian here tonight
3137300	3139300	is your experience of Christ.
3139300	3143980	So it's not just a question of reasoning.
3143980	3147660	Although reason is involved at every level.
3147660	3149380	Of course it is.
3149380	3154380	Reason and faith are not an opposition.
3155420	3157860	You need reason even to read the Bible.
3157860	3160140	People get very confused about it.
3160140	3163420	And one of the reasons for that confusion is
3163420	3166460	they think that they called me an apologist.
3166460	3167300	I don't like that.
3167300	3171220	I try to persuade people and I use argument.
3171220	3174980	But the key to the effectiveness of that
3174980	3179260	is that when Paul stood up and reasoned in Athens
3179260	3180580	and reasoned everywhere else
3180580	3183380	and the Lord did it all the time,
3183380	3187980	Paul was using his abilities but he wasn't trusting them.
3187980	3192860	And the danger for Christians often with a high education
3192860	3195740	is that they start to trust their reason
3195740	3198660	and they use God when they get stuck.
3198660	3201820	Real Christianity is to use our reason
3201820	3205820	and all the abilities he's given us but to trust him.
3205820	3208060	That's the key it seems to me.
3208060	3210180	And that solves a lot of difficulties
3210180	3214900	and we must beware that the arguments are all important
3214900	3218080	but we trust God.
3218080	3221780	And if we're trusting God we'll know
3221820	3224900	how to move and detect whether questions
3224900	3227220	are genuine or not, many are.
3227220	3229740	Many people simply need the stones out of the way
3229740	3232220	so that they can see clearly what the gospel is.
3232220	3236220	But in the end, God is not a proposition.
3236220	3237660	He's a person.
3237660	3241140	Christ is not a set of propositions.
3241140	3245700	He's a person so that what is being offered to us
3245700	3248540	is a relationship of trust with a person.
3248540	3250460	That's a huge thing.
3250460	3253660	A relationship with the one who created the universe.
3253660	3256900	And that for me is the biggest thing.
3256900	3259540	And in this world where it's being attacked
3259540	3262460	left, right and center, we need to know
3262460	3266460	not simply what we believe but why we believe it
3266460	3269220	because you cannot open your mouth
3269220	3271820	in a multicultural, pluralistic society
3271820	3275860	like what we've got here without people misunderstanding,
3275860	3279340	misrepresenting or simply just being curious
3279380	3281700	and we've got to answer.
3281700	3286540	Always, said Peter, be ready to give an answer to people
3286540	3291540	and a pologia to people who demand a reason
3292220	3294620	for the hope that is within you.
3294620	3297700	But do it with meekness.
3299040	3301420	Justin Briley wrote a brilliant book
3301420	3305020	called The Surprising Rebirth of Belief in God.
3305020	3309100	And his main argument is that the new atheism
3309100	3312780	wave is actually gone now and it's failed.
3312780	3315740	And there's a lot of evidence to support that actually.
3315740	3319340	And there's a new conversation coming on
3319340	3321780	with new questions being asked
3321780	3324020	that weren't asked 20 years ago.
3324020	3326380	For example, what is the meaning of life?
3326380	3330020	What is my identity and so on.
3330020	3335020	Now, at the same time, we all know that Christianity,
3335020	3338380	according to the last census, is going down
3338380	3340500	and is not what it used to be.
3340500	3344260	So it's declining in the Western societies,
3344260	3347140	at least in Western Europe.
3347140	3349820	But how do you reconcile the two views?
3349820	3353460	And do you think there's a new wave of intellectuals,
3353460	3356660	perhaps as Justin mentioned, people like Jordan Peterson,
3356660	3359420	it was great to see you on his podcast,
3359420	3362060	people like Louise Perry, Tom Holland and others
3362060	3367060	who not only agree that Europe was based on Christianity
3367780	3370980	and the foundation of Europe is Christian,
3370980	3373740	but they also acknowledge and appreciate
3373740	3375860	the social value of Christianity.
3375860	3377740	How do you reconcile these two views?
3378940	3383100	Well, first of all, I support your view of Justin's book
3383100	3387700	and spare his blushes, but I would encourage you to read.
3387700	3391980	This man has probably one of the most comprehensive
3391980	3394420	experiences of entering the arena
3394460	3397180	and getting both sides together to debate these things.
3397180	3400540	And it is very worthwhile reading.
3400540	3403860	And if you get anything tonight, get that book.
3403860	3405180	That's number one.
3405180	3410180	Number two, I think, is that I think he's right
3410580	3413140	that the new atheism is waning
3413140	3418140	and it's a belligerent kind of atheism that has dropped.
3418220	3420860	There's another kind of vicious atheism
3420860	3422900	that is keeping preville imprisoned
3423020	3425940	in Xinjiang and China and all of that.
3425940	3427980	We'll not go into that tonight,
3427980	3432980	but it has changed and questions of meaning and identity
3433860	3437580	are coming up to the fore in the population
3437580	3441380	and young people, people want some kind of identity.
3441380	3443780	That's a pressure coming in one direction.
3443780	3446300	Then there are transhumanists in the other direction
3446300	3450220	saying we're going to give you an enhanced identity,
3450260	3454180	but it's going to involve bioengineering.
3454180	3456700	It's going to involve you giving up a lot of things
3456700	3459660	and we need to listen to C.S. Lewis in this.
3459660	3463460	I would recommend to everybody to read a book
3463460	3466340	that you mentioned earlier on, The Abolition of Man.
3466340	3469340	It's a short book, but it's prescient.
3469340	3474220	And Lewis saw in that book and in his science fiction novel,
3474220	3478860	that hideous strength, that if a group of scientists
3478860	3483860	get the capacity to modify human identity,
3483860	3488220	for example, by messing around with the human genome
3489940	3494780	and creating a heritable sequence
3494780	3499260	where the specification of human beings will change forever.
3499260	3502900	What they will produce are not human beings
3502900	3505340	in the image of God, but artifacts.
3505340	3507580	And he has got this chilling statement.
3507580	3510780	He says, the final triumph will be
3510780	3513780	of man will be the abolition of man.
3513780	3517260	They won't be humans, they'll be beings of some kind.
3517260	3519940	And I fear we're moving rapidly towards that
3519940	3523820	because in my research of artificial intelligence,
3523820	3527700	there's a disproportionate number of people driving it
3527700	3531740	who are very strongly convinced of the atheist worldview.
3531740	3536460	It's not worldview neutral, so we need to take that on board.
3536460	3539780	And it's wonderful that we have particularly young people
3539780	3543420	around who are communicating the gospel in a way
3543420	3544980	that's got street credibility
3544980	3547060	because it's bringing young people meaning.
3547060	3549260	And we need to encourage people like that
3549260	3553020	and develop their ability and give them a platform.
3553020	3556420	But there are, as you say, some very interesting people
3556420	3559900	around Jordan Peterson, but whom I interacted recently
3559900	3564180	and it's on YouTube, is one of them
3564180	3567780	who's moving incrementally, but moving clearly
3567780	3572620	and on his own confession towards the Christian faith.
3572620	3575700	Tom Holland, with whom I've interacted personally.
3575700	3579980	Fascinating, brought up as an ancient historian
3579980	3582060	and his book Dominion is Brilliant.
3582060	3585340	But what it's devoted to is his change.
3585340	3587900	He thought originally that all the good things
3587900	3591100	in our society came from the Greeks and the Romans.
3591100	3593700	He then discovered they came actually
3593700	3596260	from the biblical worldview.
3596260	3601940	And he has got a wonderfully powerful statement
3601940	3604940	about the effect of the cross.
3604940	3608220	It is quite remarkable to read, and that's another book.
3608220	3610300	We're recommending lots of books tonight.
3610300	3611940	Dominion Worth Reading.
3611940	3613740	And there are a number of people, it seems,
3613740	3616260	to be around the world who, intellectuals,
3616260	3620620	public intellectuals, who seem to be moving step by step
3620620	3624580	towards a full confession of the Christian faith.
3624580	3627260	And there's then an outer group of people,
3627260	3630060	and I keep meeting them who, although they're not
3630060	3633540	that far yet, they are convinced that the materialism
3633540	3637860	that dominates the academy and elsewhere is not enough.
3637860	3641900	And they say to me, John, there must be something more.
3641900	3643700	Well, that's a great start to realize
3643700	3645420	there must be something more.
3645420	3648140	That's a very good point because this new conversation
3648140	3651500	opens the door to all things spiritual.
3651500	3654980	And there's a new generation that's seeking meaning
3654980	3658300	and looking beyond this world and seeking
3658300	3661580	some spiritual meaning, even though that may not
3661580	3662660	be Christianity.
3662660	3667300	Now, as we close, John, there are many, many young people
3667300	3670500	in this audience who still have doubts
3670500	3673580	and feel there might be a tension between science
3673580	3674820	and faith in God.
3674820	3678420	What advice would you give to young people
3678420	3680900	in the audience who may feel this tension?
3682620	3685460	Don't duck the questions if they come up in your mind.
3685460	3687220	That's the first thing.
3687220	3691220	Because one of the reasons I'm sitting here as a believer,
3691220	3696220	80 years old and a scientist, is that I've discovered
3696220	3697380	in life there are answers.
3697380	3700820	Sometimes you have to wait a bit, you have to do some work.
3700820	3704660	But that's important, that the questions that bother you
3704660	3709220	start to do a bit of reading, talk to other people,
3709220	3712940	openly about your questions and your doubts.
3712940	3716460	Because a large part of my Christian conviction
3716460	3719460	has come from asking hard questions
3719460	3721940	and waiting till I got answers.
3721940	3723580	Now, I don't know whether I'm allowed to do
3723580	3725540	a little bit of advertising,
3725540	3729380	but I've been so concerned by this young people
3729380	3731980	feeling this tension that this book,
3731980	3734340	I was told this book, God's Undertaker,
3734380	3736660	people found too difficult to read.
3736660	3740620	So, I've done a much shorter one called
3740620	3743020	Can Science Explain Everything?
3743020	3746540	And some people are kind enough to say it has helped them,
3746540	3748900	not only young people, but older people,
3748900	3753460	to get some resolution to this tension.
3753460	3756380	And I think the main resolution will come
3756380	3759740	in the answer to the question that I did earlier,
3759740	3762780	that the God explanation and the science explanation
3762780	3765540	are different kinds of explanation.
3765540	3769740	So, read and discuss this kind of thing,
3769740	3773220	because there are answers that can ease you
3773220	3774660	through that tension.
3774660	3779660	You see, just think of a simple historical fact.
3779900	3784660	Virtually all the great pioneers of modern science,
3784660	3788900	starting with Galileo, Kepler, Newton,
3788900	3791220	coming up through Faraday Clock Maxwell,
3791220	3793300	they were all believers in God.
3793300	3796540	And historians have noticed this,
3796540	3799780	and C.S. Lewis put it beautifully as usual.
3800860	3802540	And he summed it up this way.
3802540	3804900	He said, men became scientific
3804900	3807580	because they expected law in nature,
3807580	3809100	and they expected law in nature
3809100	3811980	because they believed in the legislator.
3811980	3814660	I'm not ashamed of being a scientist and a Christian,
3814660	3819660	because arguably, it was Christianity gave me my subject.
3819860	3823300	You see, science, biology was started
3823300	3824900	on page two of the Bible.
3824900	3826820	Many people don't realize that.
3826820	3829380	God named bits of the universe,
3829380	3832020	but then he told the first humans,
3832020	3834020	you go and name the animals.
3834020	3836980	Taxonomy, naming things is the fundamental
3836980	3838420	scientific discipline.
3838420	3840260	God said, you go and do it yourself.
3840260	3841940	And we've been doing it ever since.
3841940	3844740	So, I think we've got a real mandate to do science,
3844740	3847540	and to do it with God, not against God.
3847540	3849260	John, there's a lot of wisdom in your thoughts.
3849260	3851900	Thank you very much for your insights on science
3851900	3855700	and faith in God, on evolution and creation,
3855700	3859340	on the miracles, and it's great to have you with us.
3859340	3860340	Thank you very much for your thoughts.
3860340	3861900	Ladies and gentlemen, John Lennox.
3869900	3873240	Let's kick off with a few of these very popular questions.
3874380	3877100	So, you've spoken at length about science and faith
3877100	3878420	this evening.
3878460	3880300	But one of the most popular questions here is,
3880300	3882780	do you think there could be other forms of life
3882780	3883620	in the universe?
3883620	3884940	And I suppose I would like to ask,
3884940	3886900	and if there were, would it matter?
3889260	3892020	I was asked, I was at a launch of a book
3892020	3895420	by Professor Paul Davis, a physicist,
3895420	3898260	and his book is called, Are We Alone?
3899220	3901900	And I was interviewed, and I was being interviewed
3901900	3906460	by a certain station called Premier Christian Radio.
3906460	3907300	I don't know whether you remember.
3907420	3908940	I remember the interview well.
3908940	3911580	It was one of the first times I'd had you on the show,
3911580	3913260	and I brought you on with Paul Davis.
3913260	3914340	That's right.
3914340	3916620	And Paul Davis said, as a scientist,
3916620	3920220	he thought that we weren't alone, we were alone,
3920220	3922940	but as a person, he hoped we weren't alone.
3922940	3926900	And then I was asked, did I believe
3926900	3929500	that there were other intelligence in the universe?
3929500	3932580	And I said, yes, and one very big one called God.
3933580	3937340	And quite seriously, from a Christian perspective,
3937340	3940660	there are other intelligences in the universe.
3940660	3941860	Of course there are.
3941860	3945700	And God is the greatest one, but there are others,
3945700	3948500	because we are told that there are beings,
3948500	3953500	in some sense, above us, the Bible calls them spirit beings.
3954300	3958420	They're not made of matters, we understand it,
3958420	3960300	angels and so on.
3960340	3961740	So there are others.
3961740	3966740	This whole universe is much more complex than we think.
3966980	3971980	And our vision, we don't see everything.
3972500	3976380	So I think there are, and it does matter infinitely,
3976380	3980260	because if we were the only intelligences around,
3980260	3984060	we'd be left with the question as to where we come from.
3984060	3986540	But because we know about God,
3986540	3989940	then we've got a huge answer to that question.
3990660	3992140	Thank you so much.
3992140	3995060	From the sublime to the almost ridiculous,
3995060	3998500	in this question, there are lots of theories
3998500	4001900	in our internet age floating around.
4001900	4003340	And interestingly, one of the ones
4003340	4005860	that has sort of had a bizarre revival,
4005860	4008260	is the idea that we're living on a flat earth.
4008260	4011700	And this has been, this is the most popular question,
4011700	4013020	according to the likes.
4013020	4016180	What do you think about the flat earth debate, John?
4016180	4017460	Nothing at all, really.
4017580	4020580	I mean, but in all seriousness, there's, for me,
4020580	4023580	it's a sign of the fact we live in an age
4023580	4026380	where almost anything can get airtight on these days.
4026380	4027220	And that's true.
4027220	4031420	It wasn't a cheek, I should say, that if people reject God,
4031420	4033380	they don't believe in nothing.
4033380	4035300	They end up believing in anything.
4035300	4039180	And it just shows there's masses of ridiculous things
4039180	4040180	that people believe.
4040180	4042260	And they don't believe in anything.
4042260	4046140	And it just shows there's masses of ridiculous things
4046140	4047380	that people believe.
4047380	4049700	And that is the thing that staggers me,
4049700	4051420	taking the question seriously.
4051420	4053100	They will believe that kind of thing,
4053100	4056260	where for which the evidence is all contrary.
4056260	4061260	And yet, when it comes to seriously set forward
4062060	4064420	arguments and reasons for believing in God,
4064420	4066000	they won't even listen to them.
4066000	4070540	There's a double think, and I would go as far as to say
4070540	4072500	that there's a reason for it.
4073420	4076980	There's a very interesting statement that Paul made,
4076980	4080220	that the God of this world has blinded the minds
4080220	4082500	of those who don't believe.
4082500	4087500	That there is an enemy who sets the thought forms
4087700	4088700	of the world.
4089740	4094140	And Paul analyzes the intellectual darkness
4094140	4096780	that comes about in Romans.
4096780	4100980	When people reject God, they end up worshiping stones
4100980	4102700	and inanimate things.
4102700	4106260	They ascribe creatorial power to nature
4106260	4108340	because they don't believe in God.
4108340	4111780	And some of it is utterly absurd.
4111780	4113300	And yet, that is what happens.
4113300	4116300	And I would describe it as intellectual darkness,
4116300	4118020	but there's an enemy behind it.
4119500	4120820	Thank you.
4120820	4122300	This is a very popular question.
4122300	4124820	What do you think, why do you think Christianity
4124820	4129020	is on the decline in Europe, especially amongst young people?
4131300	4133860	That's very complex, I think, historically.
4133860	4137340	You're probably better positioned to answer that than I am.
4138820	4141740	There are roots in history going back to the enlightenment
4141740	4146740	of the evils perpetuated by some professing branches
4146980	4149940	of the Christian church have died hard.
4149940	4154180	The fact that in the whole EU constitution,
4154180	4157020	the word God has not mentioned at all,
4157020	4159860	the fact that our major institutions
4159860	4163640	are all of them virtually as Tom Holland
4163640	4166340	and Jordan Peters and other people are pointing out
4166340	4168340	are all traceable back to scripture,
4168340	4170860	yet that's airbrushed out of history
4170860	4174580	so that we are educating young people.
4174580	4177020	We're, in that sense, brainwashing them
4177020	4179100	and not telling them the facts
4179100	4182140	so that they just don't know.
4182140	4186500	And it's not surprising.
4186500	4188900	You see, let me put it very crudely.
4188940	4191780	If you tell people constantly, young people,
4191780	4194140	that there's no meaning in life,
4194140	4198380	they are simply animals, moderately sophisticated animals,
4198380	4200860	they'll end up believing you.
4200860	4203900	And therefore, their behavior will not be governed
4203900	4206140	by any sense of morality.
4206140	4209240	And it is frightening to read things like this.
4209240	4213500	A class of students ask this,
4213500	4215660	give an example of a moral dilemma.
4215660	4218580	Answer, what is a moral dilemma?
4220380	4223220	We are in serious trouble, folks,
4223220	4225460	but I'm glad you said in Europe
4225460	4227080	because there are other parts of the world
4227080	4230180	where Christianity is growing and thriving
4230180	4232860	and they are often the parts
4232860	4235460	where there's been much more persecution.
4235460	4237980	And then somebody pointed out to me the other day,
4237980	4239980	if you take the whole of the Bible,
4239980	4242420	how much of it was written at a time
4242420	4245820	and there was no persecution and trouble, very little.
4245820	4248940	And we have had an experience in Europe,
4248940	4251220	at least until relatively recently,
4251220	4255260	without war for an unusual period of time.
4255260	4258060	And unfortunately, into the vacuum,
4259020	4262940	there has poured all this kind of stuff,
4262940	4265660	post-modernism, atheism, all the rest of it.
4265660	4268180	And it has had an effect in our society.
4269180	4272380	But please feel free to add to that, Justin,
4272380	4274100	because from your perspective...
4274100	4275700	I wouldn't disagree with anything
4275700	4277220	that you've said there, John.
4277220	4280500	I think that we are living in the wake,
4280500	4282540	if you like, of many different forces
4282540	4285500	that have led to the way in which religion
4285500	4289100	is now seen as a private hobby, almost.
4289100	4292380	And to that extent, it's part of the fact
4292380	4295300	that our cultures are increasingly mobile, fluid.
4295300	4297500	Many community institutions have broken down
4297500	4300900	because of the focus on individualism in our culture.
4300900	4302220	And so I think there's a lot of things.
4302220	4304740	And alongside that goes, obviously,
4304740	4307620	that this materialism, this story of materialism
4307620	4310780	that obviously convinces people without good foundation,
4310780	4312700	that there is no God and so on.
4312700	4314260	I think I'm encouraged,
4314260	4316460	and part of the story I tell in my new book
4316460	4318900	is that actually people can only live on
4318900	4322500	those thin versions of reality for so long, though,
4322500	4324820	until actually people do start to come back and ask,
4324820	4327180	is this the way life is meant to be lived?
4328100	4329380	And I'm encouraged, actually,
4329380	4334100	that I see a lot of young people almost,
4334100	4336660	as we reach a point where
4336660	4339780	there's almost no familiarity with the Christian story.
4339780	4341500	One of the good things about that
4341500	4343860	is that you don't have the assumption
4343860	4345340	that you know what it is.
4345340	4347660	And sometimes it's actually easier
4347660	4349260	to start telling people what it is
4349260	4350420	when they don't know anything about it,
4350420	4352380	rather than those who think they know what it is,
4352380	4355380	but actually have a rather false idea of it in their head.
4355380	4358060	So I think we should be encouraged.
4358060	4360700	I mean, let me skip to this question
4360700	4362900	since we're talking about this.
4362900	4365500	And this is obviously a lot of people here
4365500	4367860	from the Romanian diaspora.
4367860	4369420	And someone asked, what is your advice
4369420	4371900	for the Romanian community specifically,
4371900	4373580	the Christian Romanian community,
4373580	4376780	for improving the belief climate in the UK?
4376780	4378340	Any thoughts on that, John?
4380020	4384020	Well, I have had the privilege of being in Romania
4384060	4385540	several times.
4385540	4388580	The first time I went, I was poisoned deliberately
4388580	4389980	by the secret police.
4391300	4392140	Wow.
4392140	4393500	It nearly killed me.
4393500	4394460	Gosh.
4394460	4397580	And I look back to that and the Lord preserved me
4397580	4400620	because I went to visit some marvelous Christians there,
4400620	4401820	but I've been back since
4401820	4403980	and they don't feed you poison anymore.
4405260	4407900	And they don't have the poison.
4408900	4411180	I think I could say,
4411220	4414580	but you need to ask Samuel about that.
4414580	4417620	They haven't been infected by all the poisons
4417620	4420660	of atheism that we have in the West.
4420660	4423220	So I think you've got,
4423220	4425740	and what I saw in my brief visits,
4425740	4429780	you've got much more sense of togetherness as Christians.
4429780	4431020	Well, let's ask a Romanian.
4431020	4433460	Yes, I think Samuel needs to speak to this.
4433460	4435260	You'd probably be very well positioned
4435260	4439620	to this question of how the Romanian Christian community
4439620	4443660	can specifically encourage belief in the West.
4443660	4446140	Well, I think the Romanian diaspora community
4446140	4449500	is very strong here in London and in the UK.
4449500	4452380	There are many evangelical churches in London.
4452380	4453780	And I think one of the reasons
4453780	4458580	that Romanians believe in God and keep their faith,
4458580	4462260	although they live in a very secularized society
4462260	4464900	and culture is because of communism.
4464900	4469900	And communism promoted atheism as the national ideology.
4470220	4474180	And Romanians have lived this for several decades
4474180	4476300	and experienced what that means.
4476300	4478300	And it simply doesn't work.
4478300	4481300	So that's one of the reasons that Romanians
4481300	4483260	and Eastern Europe in general
4483260	4485700	remained a very religious society.
4485700	4487060	It still is.
4487060	4489140	And I think Romanians
4489140	4491420	and other international diaspora communities,
4491420	4495020	such as the Polish diaspora community, for example,
4495020	4500020	can and may indeed revive Christianity
4500820	4505540	and bring a new energy in terms of living faith
4505540	4508380	in a secular culture as the UK.
4508380	4510860	I think that's absolutely true.
4510860	4514460	And I spent many years,
4514460	4518820	I started going to Eastern Europe in 1976
4518820	4522980	and traveled many times, particularly to Hungary, Poland
4522980	4525300	and above all, East Germany.
4525300	4529100	And I came to the conclusion that many of our modern day
4529100	4532220	so-called new atheists or passainer
4532220	4537220	have not got a clue about what atheism does to a culture.
4538020	4541860	And as Romanians, you know,
4541860	4544220	and because you know,
4544220	4548700	you can be a force for enormous good in our society.
4548700	4551260	When people start talking about these things,
4551260	4552860	you could just say, just wait a minute,
4552860	4554460	let me tell you what it was like
4554460	4557660	to live under the Sicuritate and the secret police.
4557660	4561060	And I saw this again and again in East Germany,
4561060	4563420	which was almost Stalinist
4563420	4565340	and I went there many times.
4566620	4569060	You've got a huge contribution to make.
4569060	4571260	And I think Samuel's absolutely right.
4571260	4575780	And I would encourage you to be a source
4575780	4579860	of pushback against this kind of thing.
4579860	4584860	I remember once talking in Russia actually in Siberia
4585180	4587820	to an academician about the difference
4587820	4590060	between the East and the West.
4590060	4594140	And he said, in the both parts of the world,
4594140	4598380	you've got materialism, you've got the material, we haven't.
4599380	4601740	But it's the same philosophy.
4601740	4604140	And that's the tragedy,
4604140	4607380	the stuff that you were taught under Marxism
4607380	4612380	is very little distance below the surface
4612860	4616580	of some of the leading intellectuals in the West today.
4616580	4620140	It's the same materialism as a philosophy,
4620140	4622060	but it's mixed with the consumerism
4622060	4623940	that you didn't have in those days.
4623940	4626180	And because you know what it's like
4626180	4630820	to be deprived of many things because of an ideology,
4630820	4633500	the Christian ideology or worldview
4633500	4635340	is much more precious to you
4635340	4636740	because of what it's done
4636740	4639860	until you've a huge contribution to make.
4639860	4641940	Just before we go to a question from the floor,
4641940	4643620	there's just one more that links really well
4643620	4645860	in with what you've just been talking about, John,
4645860	4647340	which is Andrew, who asks,
4647340	4649300	can you share with us a short story
4649300	4651420	from your experience before 1990
4651420	4655140	behind the Iron Curtain that could help our faith?
4655140	4657460	Because this is a fascinating aspect of your life
4657460	4660260	that perhaps not that many people know that you moved
4660460	4664460	and worked among people in Soviet Russia and so on.
4664460	4668300	Yes, well, before 1990, I wasn't in Russia.
4668300	4673060	I went there first in 1989, 1990.
4673060	4676780	But let me go years before that to East Germany.
4676780	4680700	And I'll tell you one story of a girl called Esther.
4680700	4683020	And she was a very bright girl.
4683020	4685980	She'd been top of her class in school.
4685980	4688340	And I happened to be there.
4688340	4689500	I'm a German speaker.
4689500	4692660	That's why I could move easily in East Germany.
4692660	4697020	And she came home from school weeping her heart out
4697020	4698660	while we were there.
4698660	4701660	And we said, Esther, what's wrong?
4701660	4703980	She said, the teacher has just told me,
4703980	4705860	I've got to leave school and go and work
4705860	4707820	in a slipper factory.
4707820	4712820	Now, this girl had been top of her class in every year.
4713540	4717780	But at the age of 13, she was asked to take
4717780	4722780	an oath of public allegiance to the atheistic state.
4724940	4728140	And she said, I'm a Christian, I can't do that.
4728140	4729300	And she was crying.
4729300	4731100	And we were weeping with her.
4731100	4734180	But I said, Esther, what did you say to the teacher?
4734180	4736220	I'll never forget her answer.
4736220	4739780	She said, Uncle John, I said to the teacher,
4739780	4744540	sir, one day you will stand before God
4744540	4748700	and you will answer for what you've done to me this day.
4748700	4750140	I never forgot that.
4750140	4754480	It's steeled me to redouble my efforts
4754480	4759480	to fight this ideology for the rest of my life.
4759740	4762260	And that's what I've tried to do with God's help
4762260	4767260	to fight what is driving the most extreme things
4767820	4768660	on the planet.
4768660	4771420	And one of them is the persecution of the Uighurs.
4771420	4776420	But all this kind of stuff comes from not a rejection
4776580	4779420	of God, but a hatred of God.
4779420	4783340	And just that one thing encapsulates it.
4783340	4784460	Wonderful.
4784460	4786460	Let's have a question here.
4786460	4789500	Many wars are fought in the name of God.
4789500	4792820	If God really cares, why is he allowing these things
4792820	4793980	to happen?
4793980	4796860	In the next is even many lives are lost
4796860	4799660	in natural disasters, innocent lives.
4799700	4802500	Where is God when all these things happen?
4802500	4803340	Well, thank you.
4803340	4806300	That's the hardest question you can ask.
4806300	4811300	It's the hardest question for anyone of any worldview,
4811860	4815180	the problem of evil and suffering.
4815180	4819660	And I would want really to be fair to your question
4819660	4822780	to have an hour to talk about it at least
4822780	4825500	because there are no simplistic answers to this.
4825500	4828720	But I'll try and say something briefly.
4828720	4833160	You referred very briefly and concisely to two problems.
4833160	4835880	There's a problem of moral evil,
4835880	4839080	the bad things people do to one another, wars,
4839080	4841800	as we see it horribly these days.
4841800	4845120	Then there's a problem of what's called natural evil,
4845120	4848120	which is a bit of a misnomer.
4848120	4850280	And that is catastrophes, diseases,
4850280	4854760	cancers, tsunamis, earthquakes, all that kind of thing.
4854760	4859480	Now, how do we face that?
4859480	4862520	And I'm gonna cut to the middle of that
4862520	4866680	and tell you where I begin to see a possibility.
4866680	4869960	I've no simplistic answer because there isn't one.
4869960	4872940	But there are two ways of looking at it.
4874400	4879400	The person who's suffering sees it in a very different way
4880440	4883800	from say me who's watching the suffering.
4883800	4886320	In other words, cancer looks very different
4886320	4889120	in the eyes of a young mother who's just been told
4889120	4891200	she's got six months to live
4891200	4894400	and in the eyes of the oncologist who's treating her.
4894400	4897080	So there are two different sides
4897080	4899320	and the person that's watching tends
4899320	4901240	to have a more intellectual response.
4901240	4902920	They're full of big questions.
4902920	4905600	The other person is in utter pain
4905600	4909480	and needs comfort and help and encouragement.
4909480	4912160	Now, how do we face it?
4912160	4915240	Well, I'll tell you how I begin to face it.
4917160	4920840	The way you formulated the question is a very common one
4920840	4922960	and it's been there for centuries.
4922960	4926160	If there's a good and all powerful God,
4926160	4930480	how is it that the world is like this?
4930480	4934240	Now, let me look at it from the theoretical perspective first
4934240	4937480	because I'm afraid I'm a theorist, above all.
4937480	4940560	And if you want me to tell you about suffering,
4940560	4942640	just see me in the dentists.
4946120	4951120	Seriously though, many people respond to this
4951160	4953600	and say, therefore there's no God.
4954720	4956120	And many of my friends do
4956120	4958080	and I've been in Auschwitz many times
4958080	4959560	and I've wept every time.
4959560	4962000	It breaks my heart to see what's going on
4962000	4964360	in a country that I love in Ukraine.
4964360	4966040	Been there many times.
4966040	4968040	All those cities, I know them all.
4968080	4972280	So, how do we respond?
4972280	4973760	Well, there's no God.
4973760	4975080	Now, people that take that view
4975080	4977160	think they've solved the problem.
4977160	4980040	They've got rid of God, that's true.
4980040	4983400	But they've also got rid by definition of all hope.
4984440	4986960	The situation for them is totally hopeless
4986960	4989920	but actually they've got rid of the problem of evil.
4989920	4992280	Now, this is a more serious philosophical point.
4992280	4994320	So if you don't like philosophy, go to sleep
4994320	4995720	until you want to wake up.
4996720	4999640	The whole concept of evil,
5000760	5005280	I believe is directly related to the existence of God.
5005280	5008280	Dostoevsky, the famous Russian novelist,
5008280	5009440	said once, yes,
5009440	5014440	he's not exist, everything is permitted.
5014440	5017240	In other words, he didn't mean atheists can't behave.
5017240	5022240	He meant there's no reason for believing in good and evil.
5022480	5025120	And Richard Dawkins says exactly that.
5025120	5028640	He says, this universe is just what you'd expected to be.
5028640	5032160	If at bottom, there's no evil, no justice.
5032160	5034960	DNA just isn't, we dance to its music.
5034960	5038960	That's atheism, removing moral concepts.
5038960	5041280	But that doesn't work because Dawkins
5041280	5045440	doesn't even work for him because he knows he's a moral being
5045440	5048120	and therefore he talks about the problem of evil.
5048120	5050320	So there are many reasons that atheism
5050320	5052160	doesn't work intellectually,
5052160	5054960	but that's not going to help a person who's suffering.
5055960	5058640	Come now to the other side very briefly.
5059720	5062480	When I was a student, we used to have long discussions.
5062480	5065680	Well, if God is all powerful and he's all good,
5065680	5069480	and we never solved the problem, never.
5069480	5072640	I've never heard a good answer to the solution.
5072640	5074480	Now, I'm a mathematician
5074480	5077160	and when mathematicians try for centuries
5077160	5080360	to solve a problem, they usually ask themselves,
5080360	5083840	are we asking the right question?
5083840	5086560	So let me reformulate the question.
5087720	5089440	What are we faced with?
5089440	5091480	A mixed picture.
5091480	5094920	I call it beauty and barbed wire.
5094920	5096600	Beauty and bombs.
5096600	5098280	We look out at the starry night,
5098280	5102720	we see the Andromeda galaxy and it's absolutely magnificent
5102720	5104680	and then we turn on the television
5104680	5106840	and we watch what's happening in Ukraine.
5107840	5111040	Beauty and bombs.
5111040	5112960	We all have to face that.
5114200	5119200	Now, how are we going to face that mixed picture?
5120400	5124960	There's beauty, that's a mystery, if everything's evil.
5126200	5128360	How is it that we get like that?
5129800	5133760	And now I ask myself a question that's just as hard
5133760	5135600	and it's this.
5135760	5138440	We've all got to grant that it's a mixed picture.
5140400	5143280	Is there any evidence anywhere
5144440	5147720	that there's a God that we could trust with it?
5147720	5149760	That's an equally hard question.
5149760	5153720	But I believe that question brings us further
5153720	5158240	and it takes us directly to the cross
5159080	5163840	because the claim is, and I often say to people,
5163840	5167440	please listen to what Christianity claims
5167440	5168840	before you reject it.
5169840	5174520	The claim is that the one on the cross is God himself,
5174520	5175840	God incarnate.
5175840	5177880	So what, if I may put it bluntly,
5177880	5180800	is God doing on a cross, suffering?
5180800	5185120	Well, it certainly means that he hasn't remained distant
5185120	5190120	from our human suffering but has become part of it.
5190400	5194120	That's the first thing, the heart of God revealed.
5194120	5196800	Now of course, if that's where it ended,
5196800	5199040	we'd never have heard of Jesus.
5199040	5203400	The next bit is where the resurrection comes
5203400	5205480	into central role.
5205480	5206560	I would have no hope.
5206560	5210280	I wouldn't be sitting here trying to answer your question.
5210280	5214120	If I didn't believe that God had raised Jesus from the dead
5215640	5218040	and that's where the hope comes in.
5218040	5223040	You see, atheism is a hopeless faith, literally, hopeless.
5223680	5224960	There's no hope.
5224960	5227200	Now where can we get hope?
5227200	5229800	What has the atheist got to say to the young mother
5229800	5231160	with cancer?
5231160	5232000	Nothing.
5233120	5235600	Have I got anything to say as a Christian?
5236960	5239200	I can't promise her that she'd be cured
5239200	5241760	although we know God has the power to do it.
5241760	5244960	But what I can bring to her is a message of hope
5244960	5249960	that she can have a personal relationship with Christ
5250120	5254240	that will transcend death and have something
5254240	5256760	therefore to leave her children with.
5258080	5261680	Now, I was in Christchurch, New Zealand,
5262880	5267880	the same week as the earthquake and I spoke about this.
5268240	5272400	And when I'd finished, a huge audience,
5272400	5274280	one of the biggest that they'd seen in the church
5274280	5278920	for many years, there was a note left for me from a lady
5278920	5281520	and it just said, I lost my husband last week.
5283080	5287640	And she said, what you said is the first glimmer of hope
5287640	5290760	I've got, glimmer of hope.
5291840	5295360	And I believe scripture analyzes this very carefully.
5295360	5298560	I haven't time to go into it in detail, sir,
5298560	5303560	but in John 11, there is the story
5304040	5306240	of what happens when people suffer.
5306240	5307960	Lazarus died.
5307960	5311720	The sisters expected Jesus to be there and cure him.
5311720	5314960	He wasn't there, Jesus let the man die
5314960	5318360	and it nearly brought them to doubt the love of God.
5318360	5321360	And when he eventually came and Lazarus was dead,
5322320	5326440	the sister said, if you'd been here, he wouldn't have died.
5326440	5328240	And then he suddenly told Martha,
5328240	5331320	I am the resurrection and the life.
5331320	5336080	Now that whole story, I believe, shows us how this problem
5336080	5340440	on the one side can lead people to doubt the love of God,
5340440	5343480	but how Christ answers it by being the resurrection
5343480	5344320	on the life.
5344320	5347880	My final point is, I've tried to put this together
5347880	5350600	briefly in a little book that circled the world.
5350600	5354960	It's called, Where is God in a Coronavirus World?
5355000	5357360	But that'll have to do for that.
5357360	5359320	Well, thank you so much.
5359320	5361520	With apologies to the many other people
5361520	5364960	who have wanted to ask a question in person,
5364960	5366560	because time is drawn to a close,
5366560	5370560	I'm just gonna finish with a final question from Slido, John.
5370560	5373000	And this is, well, I'm gonna give you two actually,
5373000	5375600	because I think they're substantially the same question,
5375600	5378000	both very popular.
5378000	5381360	Someone asks, when Muslim people do what we do,
5381360	5384200	which is believing what they're taught by their parents
5384640	5386240	carrying on their faith,
5386240	5389320	what makes them wrong and thus right?
5389320	5391600	And to sum up that question, someone else asks,
5391600	5395120	how do you prove that Christianity is the true religion
5395120	5397480	and other religions are false?
5398360	5399760	Thanks for that.
5399760	5404760	I'm glad to hear that question because it's important.
5404800	5409080	I never try to answer that question without saying this.
5410960	5413480	When we start to talk about the differences
5413520	5417400	between religions, there is huge danger
5417400	5420280	of looking down at other people.
5421320	5426320	Now, it is very important to go back to something
5427240	5431000	that Samuel said in our interview.
5431000	5436000	Every man, woman on the planet is a person of infinite worth
5438560	5440920	made in the image of God.
5441920	5445320	And often you'll find that in essence,
5445320	5449920	the differences between religions are not moral differences.
5451200	5453800	They are differences in what people believe
5453800	5456120	about how you relate to God.
5457560	5462480	And you will find that many of our Muslim friends
5462480	5467480	and Hindu friends and others have a strong moral code.
5468160	5469320	Why is that?
5469360	5471440	From where I sit, it's because they're made
5471440	5474280	in the image of God, they're moral beings.
5474280	5478480	And scripture tells us clearly that pagans
5478480	5482760	can sometimes put professed believers in God to shame.
5482760	5487080	Abraham in particular, the father of faith
5487080	5492080	and a pagan Egyptian pharaoh had a higher moral standard
5492240	5493080	than he did.
5494200	5497320	Now, it's so important to say that
5497360	5500680	because the moment you start to critique,
5500680	5505680	people think you're better than they are morally or not.
5507600	5510680	My atheist friends could put me to shame
5510680	5512760	and you know Christians have been caught out
5512760	5514700	in all kinds of things.
5514700	5518800	So we need to be very careful that we first recognize
5518800	5522000	that the people we're talking about are made
5522000	5524160	in the image of God and therefore,
5524160	5526760	as creatures of God have infinite value.
5526880	5531720	Once we've said that, we can now come to the next question
5531720	5533600	because there's respect there.
5534480	5537520	The second point is, well, let me take the three great
5537520	5540920	monotheistic religions or we'll be here all night.
5540920	5543280	Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
5544840	5548120	Now, you could leave Christianity out.
5549280	5552280	Judaism and Islam are not going to agree
5553400	5556080	about, well, what is central to Christianity?
5556080	5558280	It might as well bring it in again.
5558280	5562600	Think of Jesus or Esa as Muslims call him.
5562600	5566820	Yeshua, as the Jews call him.
5566820	5571500	My Jewish friends believe that he died and didn't rise.
5572480	5575180	My Muslim friends believe he didn't die.
5577120	5578920	I believe he died and rose.
5578920	5582640	Those three things cannot be simultaneously correct.
5582640	5585760	And when I find, I talk about this in public,
5585760	5587880	my Jewish and Muslim friends are nodding.
5587880	5589160	They agree.
5589160	5592480	They just do not agree on what is central.
5592480	5594720	Now, how are you going to decide it?
5594720	5597760	Well, I know of no other way on a matter of evidence
5597760	5599640	and then we discuss that.
5599640	5603400	But there's another approach and that is this.
5603400	5607120	And this is, I think, the crux of the matter.
5607120	5610440	People often say to me, you know, you're a scientist
5610440	5612840	and you talk about evidence for God, the universe
5612840	5615280	and all that's marvelous, but you're a Christian.
5615280	5619640	How do you bridge the gap between belief in God
5619640	5623840	as the God of the universe and a specifically Christian
5623840	5624840	message?
5624840	5628820	Well, I say, let's look at it this way.
5629880	5634880	The heart of Christianity is rather different
5635760	5638280	from what many people expect.
5638280	5641800	And if I am to explain that, I often ask people,
5641800	5644680	I say, first of all, tell me what a religion is.
5644680	5647000	What do you think a religion is?
5647000	5650780	And I come up with a little illustration of it.
5650780	5652560	I often put it to them and say,
5652560	5654960	is your view of religion like this?
5654960	5656760	You've got a ceremony at the beginning,
5656760	5660760	some sort of initiation that puts you on a path.
5660760	5663920	And I usually draw a wavy line ups and downs.
5663920	5666720	And you stay on the path, the sick full path
5666720	5669600	or whatever it is, the way, et cetera.
5669600	5671680	And you've got various people to help you,
5671680	5675160	priests, gurus, imams, all the rest of it.
5675160	5679040	And then you come to a gate at the end,
5679040	5682120	where I draw some scales of justice.
5682120	5686120	And at the end, you're faced with an assessment
5686120	5690280	of your behavior and your deeds up to that point.
5690280	5694160	And if you pass the grade, you get accepted
5694160	5698560	into whatever it is, nirvana, heaven, or whatever.
5698560	5702440	And most people will tell me that is what we believe.
5702440	5705000	And I say, perhaps the best way to think about it
5705000	5707520	is like a university course.
5707520	5712360	You have an entrance and then you study at the university,
5712360	5713800	every university in Britain
5713800	5715580	and around the world works this way.
5715580	5718320	The professors may be the best in the world,
5718320	5721400	but they cannot guarantee you a degree.
5721400	5722240	Why?
5722240	5725520	Because the whole principle of universities
5725520	5729320	is you get a degree on the basis of your merit.
5729320	5733800	And if you don't earn it, merit it, you don't get it, yes?
5733800	5736080	And many people say, yes, that is religion.
5736080	5738860	I've been told that by hundreds of people.
5738860	5741880	Well, I said, you see, that isn't Christianity.
5741880	5743880	And they say, oh, yes, it is.
5743880	5746000	Now, here's where the problem lies.
5746000	5750560	Many people think that Christianity is like that.
5750560	5754600	You pile up your good deeds, you try and please God,
5754600	5758320	and you hope at the end that he won't take his law too seriously
5758320	5760960	and will let you in.
5760960	5763880	But you see, it's not like that, folks.
5763880	5767920	Christianity, the acceptance is not
5767920	5772160	at the end of the journey of the judgment.
5772160	5776720	It's at the beginning of the journey at the cross.
5776720	5779160	Now, this is utterly revolutionary.
5779160	5786000	In that sense, Christianity is not a religion.
5786000	5788280	It isn't.
5788280	5791560	It certainly has a path and a way.
5791560	5797520	But the path follows acceptance.
5797520	5800080	It doesn't come before it.
5800080	5803960	Because the unique thing about Christianity
5803960	5808200	is that at the very beginning, what Jesus offers me
5808200	5812560	is that if I repent, that is, turn away
5812560	5815320	from the mess I've made of life, and maybe other people's
5815320	5821200	lives, sadly, and trust him as Savior and Lord who died for me,
5821200	5824600	then he will give me then, right then, the acceptance.
5827920	5830760	That's hugely important.
5830760	5833280	You see, let me give you an illustration.
5833280	5836560	This is so important because I meet dozens of people
5836560	5838560	that don't understand this.
5838560	5843680	Even in this country, 56 years ago now, nearly,
5843680	5845080	I met a girl.
5845080	5847280	She was lovely.
5847280	5850720	So I decided I'd like to marry her.
5850720	5854640	So I came along, and I gave her a lovely present.
5854640	5856600	It was wrapped up, and I said, Sally,
5856600	5859360	I'd like you to be my wife.
5859360	5860480	Now, here's the present.
5860480	5864000	So she opened it, and it was a cookbook.
5864000	5870520	So I said, read page 153.
5870520	5872240	Apple cake.
5872240	5874640	Thou shall take so much flour.
5874640	5876600	Thou shall take so much sugar.
5876600	5879880	Thou shall put it in the oven and bake it, and so on.
5879880	5885040	Now, I said, my dear, I would like you to take this book.
5885040	5887560	And if you keep these rules, let's say,
5887560	5891840	let's be reasonable, for the next 40 years,
5891840	5895800	then I will accept you.
5895800	5899840	Otherwise, you can go back to your mother.
5899840	5903240	Why are you laughing, folks?
5903240	5907080	That is how millions of people think about God.
5907080	5912080	You would never insult a fellow human being.
5912080	5914200	And I mean this very seriously.
5914200	5919000	You would never insult a fellow human being
5919000	5922720	by making acceptance dependent on their performance.
5922720	5926000	Do you think God does that?
5926000	5927720	That's turning God into a monster.
5927720	5928760	And that's why you laughed.
5928760	5929760	It's ridiculous.
5929760	5931120	Of course, I didn't do that.
5931120	5935720	Now, the amazing thing is she accepted me.
5935720	5937840	It's not amazing that I accepted her,
5937840	5939920	but it's amazing she accepted me.
5939920	5942280	And what does that do?
5942280	5944680	Does that mean she doesn't care about how she lives
5944680	5945880	and how she cooks?
5945880	5948840	Of course not.
5948840	5953080	But she's not cooking to earn my affection.
5953080	5956960	She's cooking because she's got it.
5956960	5960160	And here am I tonight talking to you, interviewing.
5960160	5961880	Why do you think I do it?
5961880	5964800	Do you think I'm doing it to earn brownie points
5964800	5967480	that God will accept me, not at all?
5967480	5969800	I'm doing it because I know my acceptance
5969800	5972360	doesn't depend on it.
5972360	5973560	And that's the difference.
5973560	5974760	Now, let me put it this way.
5974760	5977240	So it's really sharp in your minds.
5977240	5982040	And it could help you to explain this to people.
5982040	5987160	Christianity does not compete with any other religion.
5987160	5988920	Why not?
5988920	5991320	Because Jesus offers me something.
5991320	5994280	None of them offer me.
5994280	5999120	So it's a no-brainer here to accept from him something
5999120	6000680	that nobody else offers me.
6000680	6004240	Nobody else offers me forgiveness on such terms
6004240	6007240	and acceptance and love at the very beginning
6007240	6009360	and a relationship.
6009360	6011960	And that's the reason I'm a Christian.
6011960	6012960	Thank you.
6012960	6013960	Thank you.
6013960	6014960	Thank you.
6014960	6015960	Thank you.
6015960	6016960	Thank you.
6016960	6017960	Thank you.
6017960	6018960	Wow.
6018960	6019960	Thank you so much.
6019960	6020960	Thank you.
6020960	6021960	Thank you again.
6021960	6022960	Thank you again to John.
6022960	6023960	Thank you to Samuel.
6023960	6030520	And just as we close out, Virgil is going to come and give us
6030520	6033960	a little bit of a welcome and some thank yous as well.
6034080	6035080	Yes.
6035080	6038160	Well, we've had a wonderful evening.
6038160	6039160	Do you agree?
6039160	6040160	Yes.
6040160	6041160	Yeah.
6041160	6042160	Good.
6042160	6043880	We want to thank Samuel and Practical Wisdom
6043880	6048000	for this wonderful conference.
6048000	6050320	We started talking about this in May.
6050320	6053840	And little did we know that we'd come and end up in
6053840	6058440	Central London filling a famous place like this with so many
6058440	6063280	young people and Romanian people interested to hear from an English professor
6063280	6067200	from Oxford born in Ireland.
6067200	6070640	Then again, we want to thank Professor Lennox for this extraordinary
6070640	6073880	and very enlightening evening.
6073880	6077960	We want to thank the organizer, the Ezra Christian Center, and its
6077960	6082440	wonderful contributors in terms of finance, energy, and time.
6082440	6085760	Also a warm thank you to our generous sponsors.
6085760	6089360	Without her this evening would not have been possible.
6089360	6094560	And I'm going to quickly read their names and please do applaud.
6094560	6098480	We want to thank Holy Trinity Romanian Church in Kingsbury, Holy River
6098480	6103560	Church in Pinner, Connected Life Church in Birmingham, Life Spring
6103560	6111640	Community in London, Zion Brother in Church in Stratford, Bethel
6111640	6116320	Brother in Church in Kenton, Christchurch in Layton, Harvest Church
6116400	6120720	in Louton, Emanual Romanian Church in Pinner, New Life Church in
6120720	6125080	High Wycombe, Seventh Day Adventist Church in Hampstead and Adventist
6125080	6129920	Conference, and the Romanian Pentecostal Church in Slough.
6129920	6133280	We cannot conclude this list without expressing our heartfelt gratitude
6133280	6138920	to Westminster Chapel for their very generous offer of this premises
6138920	6140160	for the evening.
6140160	6145600	They've been very kind to us and they've been very helpful in every respect.
6145600	6148680	And thank you of the AV team from this place as well.
6157080	6161480	We often read in Romania books written by C.S.
6161480	6169800	Lewis, books by John Lennox and many books by Martin Lloyd Jones.
6169800	6172960	Here we are tonight in the very place where he preached.
6173960	6179400	I want to point out that we had people tonight coming as far as Scotland,
6179400	6183800	the West of England, and some even from Romania.
6183800	6185160	So well done, guys.
6191160	6195360	Often forgotten and overlooked, I want to commend our wonderful volunteers
6195360	6200080	who have worked for the whole afternoon here to arrange the chairs to make this
6200080	6204120	meeting possible, and they will be working long into the night after all
6204120	6205520	this is going to be over.
