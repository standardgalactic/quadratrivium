1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's take the first point where you said

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,440
science has explained how the universe came to be.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,640
It hasn't.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,840
And that was the surprise I found

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,040
in reading Hawking's more recent book.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,400
I was quite amazed to read the following key sentence

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,240
in the book.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,480
It goes like this.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,480
Because there is a law like gravity,

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,480
the universe can and will create itself from nothing.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,800
And that was the reason he gave for saying we don't need God.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,760
But just think of the statement.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,600
Because there is a law like gravity,

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,960
that is because there is something.

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,120
The universe will create itself from nothing.

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,320
That's a flat contradiction before you start.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,200
Good evening, everybody.

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,880
How are you doing?

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,760
Good to see you.

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,960
Welcome to Westminster Chapel.

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,320
And to what I'm sure will be a really, really interesting

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,960
conference this evening, the Practical Wisdom Conference.

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,880
We're talking, of course, this evening

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,200
about faith in the age of science.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,680
Very often in our era, many people, especially atheists,

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,080
have claimed that science effectively disproves God.

27
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,320
Well, someone who has been answering those atheists

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,040
directly for a number of years is, of course, John Lennox.

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,640
John is a well-known Christian thinker.

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,880
He is emeritus professor of mathematics

31
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,040
and the philosophy of science at the University of Oxford.

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,600
And I've had the privilege of interviewing

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,480
and bringing John into conversation

34
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,600
with many skeptics over many years.

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,520
Myself, my role here is that I've

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,160
been hosting conversations between skeptics and Christians

37
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,080
for a number of years.

38
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,480
In fact, over 15 years, some people

39
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,280
know me from The Unbelievable Show, which

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,840
I hosted for 17 years or more.

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,920
And I'm currently engaged in some new projects.

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,920
And I'll be excited to tell you about those as well a little

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,760
later on in the evening.

44
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,240
But really, you're here to obviously see and hear

45
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,880
from John Lennox.

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,640
So I'd like to invite both Samuel and John

47
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,040
to join me on stage as they begin this evening.

48
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,440
Do give them a round of applause.

49
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:21,880
Welcome everyone to Practical Wisdom,

50
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,480
and thank you very much for joining us.

51
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,800
My name is Samuel Maruska, and today we're

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,760
going to be talking about faith in God and science.

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,720
And there's no one better suited to have this conversation

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,040
with than Professor John Lennox.

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,120
John, it's great to have you with us.

56
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,600
Welcome to Practical Wisdom.

57
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,240
Well, thank you very much, Samuel.

58
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,400
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming.

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,120
I'd just like to say how grateful I

60
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,320
am to Samuel and the team that have organized this,

61
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:59,560
because as Justin has just said, getting public discussion

62
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,640
on the big ideas is increasingly important

63
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,720
as our culture disintegrates by various influences that

64
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,760
come around.

65
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,320
Now, I want to encourage you to read Justin's book

66
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,520
afterwards, and I want to tell you

67
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,200
that Samuel is a formidable interviewer,

68
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,160
and that we have not colluded.

69
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,880
I don't know what he's going to ask me.

70
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,560
So I sit here in fear and trembling,

71
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,640
and look forward to the questions

72
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,120
that he's going to put to me.

73
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,760
John, you've engaged in many debates with intellectuals

74
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,240
and really heavyweight thinkers, people

75
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,080
like Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens,

76
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,120
and many other influential atheists.

77
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,440
Many people in this room will know you from these debates.

78
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,520
Can you talk a little bit about these debates?

79
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,600
Which one was one of the most remarkable one?

80
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,520
And also, what insights have you gained

81
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,560
from this experience?

82
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,320
I suppose one of the most remarkable ones,

83
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,200
and partly for a humorous reason,

84
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,320
was the debate with Professor Peter Singer, who's

85
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,520
one of the world's leading ethicists.

86
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,000
And I was invited to debate him on his home turf that

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,760
is in Melbourne City Hall some years ago,

88
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,000
although he teaches at Princeton.

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,160
And in the opening remarks, I'm always open with audiences

90
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,200
and point out that my parents were Christian.

91
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,440
And when he started, he said, well,

92
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,600
there goes my main objection against all religion.

93
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,880
People stay in the religion in which they were brought up.

94
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,120
And when I heard that, I thought,

95
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,720
this is going to be very interesting.

96
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,600
Because when I got a chance to speak, I said, Peter,

97
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,400
I told them about my parents.

98
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,040
Tell me about your parents.

99
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,880
Were they atheists?

100
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,680
Yes, he said they were atheists.

101
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,440
So I said, you stayed in the faith in which you grew up then.

102
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,960
Oh, but he said, it isn't a faith.

103
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,920
Oh, Peter, I said, I'm very sorry.

104
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,200
I thought you believed it.

105
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,920
And cyberspace went mad at that time

106
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,160
that here was one of the world's leading thinkers who

107
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,360
didn't realize that his atheism was a belief system.

108
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,160
And you notice how carefully Dr. Mariska Samuel

109
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,320
introduced this.

110
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,800
He talked about faith in God.

111
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,000
Because all people are people of faith.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,560
Everybody's got a worldview that they believe.

113
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,400
And this really exposed one of the biggest problems

114
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,880
we have in our culture, that Christians

115
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,720
are regarded as people of faith.

116
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,320
That means they believe that there's no evidence.

117
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,200
But atheists, they're not people of faith.

118
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,680
They're rational.

119
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,000
And fighting against that is one of the things

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,320
I've been doing for a long time.

121
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,080
What have I learned from it?

122
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,600
That's hard to assess.

123
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,080
I've learned that it's pretty scary debating

124
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,720
some of these people, certainly that.

125
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,040
And also, it has confirmed my faith enormously.

126
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Because spending a lot of time unpicking these arguments

127
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,360
as I grow older, I find them less and less intellectually

128
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,920
impressive.

129
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,400
But I think it's so important that we enter this debate,

130
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,880
or we have shows like Justin has been doing for years,

131
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,360
to allow people to see both sides of the debate.

132
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,680
I think that's a very healthy thing.

133
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,640
And it enables people to see that Christianity has actually

134
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,000
got very powerful evidence to support it.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,040
And we need to know that evidence.

136
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,120
So you mentioned faith there.

137
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,200
And you obviously have very interesting ideas

138
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,600
on faith in God and science.

139
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,560
And the Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor

140
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,840
has this secularization theory.

141
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,080
And he wrote extensively about this.

142
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,800
And he said, in ancient times, people

143
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,520
needed God to explain supernatural things.

144
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,160
So for example, if you had a solar eclipse,

145
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,040
people in ancient times would think

146
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,840
that would be the wrath of God manifested.

147
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,240
But nowadays, that science has explained that.

148
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
We don't need God anymore.

149
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
So science has replaced God.

150
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,800
We know there's no mystery there.

151
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,640
We know how the planets move.

152
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,760
We can explain what happens during a solar eclipse.

153
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,720
And we can actually predict all of this next solar eclipse

154
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,360
for the next 1,000 years.

155
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,560
So science has replaced God.

156
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,400
This is part of the secularization theory.

157
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,360
And we live in a very secular society in the UK.

158
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,480
And also, there's this God of the Gaps view,

159
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,600
which says, and many atheists and thinkers will say,

160
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,920
look, Christians are a bit of a bit,

161
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,360
some perhaps more lazy thinkers.

162
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Because if they can't explain something,

163
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,880
they just say, well, we can't explain it.

164
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,840
Therefore, God did it.

165
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,320
And this is the label that many atheists

166
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,040
would put on Christian thought.

167
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,200
What is your view on the God of the Gaps theory?

168
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,160
Well, it may apply to some people,

169
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,760
but I don't think it applies to me,

170
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,800
as I tried to explain,

171
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,800
but there are really two questions hidden there.

172
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,720
There's this notion that God and science

173
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,880
are alternatives in terms of explanation.

174
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,720
For a long time, I couldn't understand

175
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,920
why people as bright as Stephen Hawking

176
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,600
constantly said to the public,

177
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,600
you've got to choose between God and science.

178
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,720
And I realized for a long time

179
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,360
that part of the reason for that

180
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
was they didn't understand

181
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,640
the nature of scientific explanation.

182
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,360
Now, that may sound like a very arrogant claim

183
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,840
for me to make, but actually, it's quite simple.

184
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,840
We need to realize that the God explanation

185
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,280
and the science explanation

186
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,560
are different kinds of explanation.

187
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,440
And I often give a very simple example to illustrate it,

188
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,160
that even some professors can understand.

189
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,320
And it's this, why is the water boiling?

190
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,200
Well, because the heat energy

191
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,400
is agitating the molecules of water and is boiling.

192
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,960
Well, that's a scientific explanation,

193
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,480
but I could equally well say it's boiling

194
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,200
because I want a cup of tea.

195
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,360
Now, that is an agent, personal explanation.

196
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,240
Now, think about those two explanations,

197
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,560
they're different, but they do not compete,

198
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,160
they do not conflict, they complement each other.

199
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,800
And I often say to people,

200
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,800
the God explanation is the agent type explanation.

201
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,160
God is the explanation of why there is a universe at all

202
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,120
and why there are scientists there to study it.

203
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,800
He's not competing in that sense at all.

204
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,680
And we need both, as I find most school children can say.

205
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,680
The second thing is that many contemporary thinkers

206
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,040
have lost the idea of a God who's a transcendent creator

207
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,400
who upholds the universe.

208
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,400
And they think of God in terms of the Greek God of thunder.

209
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,920
They couldn't explain thunder, as you said,

210
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,720
to the postulated God.

211
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,720
It's very important to realize

212
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,240
that the God of the Bible is not in that category.

213
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,000
There's a brilliant writer in Oxford

214
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,720
at one stage, Werner Yeager,

215
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,840
who was an expert on the Greek gods and the Babylonian gods.

216
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,000
And he made this point, which I think is very important.

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,240
He said, all the gods of the ancient philosophies

218
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,680
and religions are, quote,

219
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,640
descended from the heavens and the earth.

220
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,320
That is they were actually part

221
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,840
of the original material cosmos.

222
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,880
The God of the Bible created the heavens and the earth.

223
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,580
So they're completely different categories.

224
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,640
Now, with that as background,

225
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,080
let me come to the heart of your question,

226
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,760
which is the God of the gaps.

227
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,480
Now, I'm allergic to this in the sense that

228
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,320
I do not want people to think

229
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,600
that I believe in a God of the gaps.

230
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,200
So how do I deal with it?

231
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,920
Well, in several different ways.

232
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,880
I'm going to go for the easiest one.

233
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,880
And it's this, that think of Isaac Newton

234
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,360
and his wonderful law of gravitation.

235
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,280
And I used to love explaining it to students

236
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,080
how you get an equation with eight symbols in it.

237
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,980
And from it, you could deduce the motion

238
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,600
of the planets around the sun.

239
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,520
It is just brilliant stuff.

240
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,400
Now, when Newton discovered that,

241
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,400
did he think, right, I have now got an equation

242
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,520
that allows me to deduce the motion

243
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,160
of the planets from it.

244
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,040
I don't need God.

245
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,200
No, he didn't.

246
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,760
He wrote what was perhaps the most brilliant book

247
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,680
in the history of science at Principia Mathematica.

248
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,960
And he dedicated it to with the hope

249
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,160
that thinking people would see in it evidence

250
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,400
for the existence of a divine intelligence

251
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,520
behind the universe, because his argument was this.

252
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,520
I found this wonderful mathematical description

253
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,520
of what goes on in between heavy bodies

254
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,560
and how they move.

255
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,520
What a brilliant God who did it that way.

256
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,560
And it's exactly that in the way we normally think.

257
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,120
If you know a lot about painting,

258
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,120
you will see much more in a Rembrandt picture than I would

259
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,920
who am pretty ignorant about art, although I like it.

260
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,400
You can see the genius.

261
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,720
If you're an engineer, you'll see much more

262
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,040
in a Rolls-Royce engine than I possibly would,

263
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,000
because you see the evidence.

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,120
And to my mind, God is not a God of the gaps.

265
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,120
He is the most powerful explanatory power

266
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,760
to make sense of the whole thing.

267
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,740
I'm a mathematician.

268
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,720
The very fact that we can do mathematics to me

269
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,280
is an indicator that this is a word-based universe

270
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,520
to put it that way.

271
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,720
The very fact that in biology,

272
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,960
we've discovered the longest word, the human genome,

273
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,680
3.4 billion letters in a chemical alphabet

274
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,820
is evidence of an intelligent mind.

275
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,620
That's not a mind of the gaps.

276
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,660
It's the only thing that makes sense.

277
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,180
Now, I'm looking around the room,

278
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,460
but the lights are blind to me.

279
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,380
Oh, yes, I see a word of their prayer.

280
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,660
How very suitable.

281
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,980
There are two, four, six letters.

282
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,260
The moment you see that, what do you deduce?

283
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,020
Well, you can see letters.

284
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,260
They have meaning to you.

285
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,820
You cannot explain that meaning

286
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,660
in terms of the physics and chemistry

287
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,580
of the paper and paint there.

288
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,660
But the moment you see that,

289
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660
there are many mechanical processes

290
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,420
that went in producing that sign.

291
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,220
But you know, because that carries meaning,

292
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,740
it's a word that behind it, there was a mind.

293
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,540
Not a mind of the gaps,

294
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,260
but a mind that's the only sensible explanation

295
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,700
of what you're reading up there.

296
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,420
It's that kind of argument to my mind

297
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,940
that I find extremely convincing.

298
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,900
So you talked about meaning there and semantics,

299
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,660
and the word semantics,

300
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,420
there's Richard and Ogden published this book in 1923,

301
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,180
a hundred years ago, called The Meaning of Meaning.

302
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,860
And it's a very popular book.

303
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,340
And they talked about how language influences thought

304
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,620
and affects thought.

305
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,100
And they devised the semantic triangle,

306
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,820
which is a model of meaning,

307
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,180
which when you have the symbol or the sign,

308
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,540
linguistic sign on one side,

309
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,540
you have the actual thing in reality on the other side,

310
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,300
which is the reference,

311
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,460
and then you have at the top thought.

312
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,580
And it's the relation and the causal relation

313
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,100
and interactions of these three that give you meaning.

314
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,300
This book actually was very influential in philosophy

315
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,460
and also influenced C.S. Lewis

316
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,140
in The Abolition of Man, published in 1943,

317
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,420
in which he talked about objective moral standards

318
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,220
and also natural law.

319
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,580
So people and scientists sometimes say,

320
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,380
look, there's this universe out there

321
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,100
with millions of galaxies, with hundreds of thousands of stars,

322
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,860
and they all dance together in a very interesting,

323
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,900
in a beautiful rhythm because of the gravity law.

324
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,820
But there is no meaning to that.

325
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,700
And also, as a human being, which is, as humans,

326
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,140
this is a microcosm.

327
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,780
There's no meaning in our life either.

328
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,220
Does meaning imply intelligent design?

329
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,420
It's interesting that people should even say a thing like that.

330
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,980
There is no meaning in it.

331
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,740
And they expect me to understand

332
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,260
the meaning of that statement.

333
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,380
It's one of these incoherent things

334
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,180
that people make statements

335
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,180
and they are unconsciously accepting themselves.

336
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,460
It's like, may I tell a little story?

337
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,300
Please do.

338
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,620
Sitting in my Oxford College beside a man who had a book

339
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,340
and he was putting it on the table.

340
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,300
And I could see its title was curious about semantics

341
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,140
and so on.

342
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,260
I said, what's your book about?

343
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,660
But he said, this is a book that shows

344
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,620
that there's no such thing as authorial intention.

345
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,260
I said, pardon?

346
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,180
I said, you mean if I read your book,

347
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,140
I will understand that an author has no intention.

348
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,340
He said, exactly.

349
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,140
So I said, I'm not gonna read it.

350
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,340
So he said, why not?

351
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,420
Well, I said, it must apply to your book as well.

352
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,580
But he never thought about it.

353
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,580
He got very angry.

354
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,700
He got up and walked out.

355
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,580
We never saw him again.

356
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,420
This is one of the weaknesses of this sort of loose,

357
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,420
postmodern style talk that says,

358
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,900
there's no such thing as truth,

359
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,140
but they expect you to believe that statement as a truth.

360
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,300
It goes too far.

361
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,460
It goes right over the top.

362
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,940
Now I'm very interested in the kind of way

363
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,420
in which you pose that question

364
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,780
because another person that influenced Lewis a lot,

365
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,340
one of his inklings was Barfield.

366
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,580
And Owen Barfield posed an interesting question.

367
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,940
He said, why is it we live in a world

368
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,980
where we understand how almost everything works

369
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,500
and we know the meaning of nothing?

370
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,900
Ed McGilchrist is a very interesting,

371
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,460
he's a polymath really, he's a neuroscientist.

372
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,180
But roughly speaking, he's been working

373
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,580
on something we're all familiar with.

374
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,980
When we say Jane, you know,

375
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,540
she's a real left-brained nerd,

376
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,460
always into computers and all this kind of thing.

377
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,540
Whereas James, well, he's so right-brained

378
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,620
with his head and arts and the clouds and so on.

379
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,820
Left and right brain.

380
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,180
Well, what Ian McGilchrist claims

381
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,500
in his very interesting book, which is called,

382
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,220
this is a very interesting title,

383
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,180
the matter with things,

384
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,620
is that there is substance to these differences

385
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,060
between the two brain hemispheres.

386
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,140
And roughly speaking, both brain hemispheres

387
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,020
are involved in virtually every event

388
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,340
in our brains and minds.

389
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,180
But the differences are that indeed,

390
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,980
there is this concentration in the left brain

391
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,060
on rational thought, on analysis, on breaking things down.

392
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,820
Whereas the right brain concerns itself much more

393
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,660
with putting things into context and meaning.

394
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,660
And he says this, for the last four or 500 years,

395
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,260
we have neglected the right brain.

396
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,060
So that we're living in a world

397
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,940
where we know how most things work,

398
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,180
but we understand the meaning of nothing.

399
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,900
And when our late chief rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, read that,

400
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,620
he had a light bulb moment and he wrote a book

401
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,220
because of it, a very interesting book

402
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,740
called The Great Partnership.

403
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,700
But he put it this way, and I like this formulation,

404
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,740
it's very helpful.

405
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,780
He said, science takes things apart to see how they work.

406
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,860
Religion puts them together to see what they mean.

407
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,700
And it seems to me that captures something

408
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,300
extremely important, that we need to focus

409
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
on the meaning side.

410
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,980
Because science is powerful precisely

411
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,300
because it limits the questions it can answer.

412
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,220
It cannot give us meaning and it cannot give us value.

413
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,220
Einstein saw that years ago.

414
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,860
He said you could talk about the ethical foundations

415
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,340
of science, but you cannot talk about

416
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,580
the scientific foundations of ethics.

417
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,380
You have to look outside.

418
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,100
And I always cite one of Richard Dawkins'

419
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,620
favorite scientists, Sir Peter Bedouin,

420
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,380
who said it's so easy to see.

421
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,260
And this is hugely important because science is so powerful.

422
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,140
It's so easy to see, he wrote, that science is limited

423
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,740
because it cannot even answer the simple question

424
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,180
of a child.

425
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,740
Where do I come from?

426
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,220
Where am I going and what is the meaning of life?

427
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,220
And to answer those questions, we need to go to literature

428
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,340
and I would add, well he added philosophy

429
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,060
and I would add theology and a lot of other things as well.

430
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:15,060
Because the fatal flaw in much so-called academic thinking

431
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,820
is that people have come to believe

432
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,420
that science is co-extensive with rationality,

433
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,820
which is nonsense.

434
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,740
History is a rational discipline.

435
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,500
So is theology, so is economics,

436
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,900
but they're not the natural sciences.

437
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,020
If science and rationality were co-extensive,

438
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,420
you'd have to close half the departments

439
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,180
in every university in the United Kingdom.

440
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,940
So that's how I'd begin to approach your question.

441
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,380
So science doesn't really explain the things

442
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,180
that we think it explains.

443
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,020
No, that's important.

444
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,260
It's very limited.

445
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,780
Yes, but what you're hinting at there is even deeper

446
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,260
because I used to think at school,

447
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,780
because I was pretty naive then I suppose,

448
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,340
that Newton's law of gravity explained gravity.

449
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,020
It doesn't, you know.

450
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,900
Nobody yet knows really what gravity is.

451
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,100
Newton's law of gravitation gives you

452
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,140
a mathematical capacity to calculate

453
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,980
what happens when heavy bodies move

454
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,500
in relation to one another,

455
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,860
so accurately that it'll help you land a person on the moon.

456
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,820
But Newton realized all those years ago

457
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,020
that it doesn't tell you what gravity is.

458
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,340
So even within science itself,

459
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,140
a scientific explanation is rarely,

460
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,980
if ever, a complete explanation.

461
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,300
I focused in the last several years

462
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,140
on the nature of explanation

463
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,900
because I feel there's huge confusion about it.

464
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,780
But science did explain how the universe came to be

465
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,180
and also it conflicts,

466
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,100
this conflicts with the Genesis account and creationism.

467
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,020
I think this is a very important issue for Christians

468
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,820
because science seems to have explained

469
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,060
and seems to go against creationism.

470
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,860
For example, some Christians say

471
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,340
that the earth is only 6,000 years old.

472
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,380
So science seems to have explained that

473
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,140
and contradict that irrefutably.

474
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,300
And then you also have statements in Genesis

475
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,300
that man was created in the image of God, Imago Dei.

476
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,340
And I think this is hugely important

477
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,300
because this is the cornerstone of our Western civilization.

478
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,220
Now Harari took this a step further

479
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,100
in his book, Homo Deus, and said two things.

480
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,060
One, we can enhance human life

481
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,020
by using data information and AI

482
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,460
very much based on Nietzsche's Ubermensch

483
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,020
from the 19th century.

484
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,580
And also the second point he made in his book was that

485
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,580
death is only a medical problem

486
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:09,100
and eventually science will help us overcome that as well.

487
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,540
So the question is two pronged, I guess, John.

488
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:17,540
One, does evolution and the general theory of evolution

489
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,620
go against creationism?

490
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,060
And also, what is your take?

491
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,140
What does the image of God mean to you?

492
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,300
It's actually a four pronged question

493
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,420
I've worked out listening to you, or five even.

494
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,340
Let's take the first point where you said

495
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,780
science has explained how the universe came to be.

496
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,980
It hasn't.

497
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,180
And that was the surprise I found

498
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,380
in reading Hawking's more recent book.

499
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,740
I was quite amazed to read the following key sentence

500
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,580
in the book.

501
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,820
It goes like this, because there is a law like gravity,

502
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,820
the universe can and will create itself from nothing.

503
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,060
And that was the reason he gave for saying

504
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,060
we don't need God, but just think of the statement.

505
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,900
Because there is a law like gravity,

506
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,300
that is because there is something.

507
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,460
The universe will create itself from nothing.

508
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,100
That's a flat contradiction before you start.

509
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,660
But do scientists mean the same thing?

510
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,580
For me, nothing means the absence of something.

511
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,300
Do scientists mean the same thing?

512
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,500
No, they have to redefine nothing

513
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,260
as a quantum vacuum or something like this.

514
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,060
And then they get into incredible complexities.

515
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,300
I've written a book about this, by the way,

516
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,460
called Seven Days and Divide the World.

517
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,780
But let's just come back to the statement.

518
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,780
Because it's worse than that.

519
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,100
He says the universe will create itself.

520
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,660
What on earth could that mean?

521
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,420
Sorry, I didn't mean to put the earth in,

522
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,660
because that's the point.

523
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,740
The universe, if I say X creates Y,

524
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,020
roughly speaking, you would understand me to mean

525
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,340
if you've got X, you'll get Y.

526
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,180
If I say X creates X, I think what that tells me

527
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,300
is that nonsense remains nonsense,

528
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,980
even if scientists write it.

529
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,940
And as C.S. Lewis himself pointed out.

530
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,020
So number one point in response to you.

531
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,860
I don't believe science has told us

532
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,420
how the universe came to be.

533
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,100
It is certain theories of the etiology

534
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,380
of the history of space-time.

535
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,100
And as you say, a long time ago.

536
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,180
So let's come up a little bit.

537
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,020
Second point you mentioned was age of the earth

538
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,980
and creationism.

539
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,540
Now I must make a confession.

540
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,340
Because a few weeks ago,

541
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,260
I was speaking at the speech day in my own school,

542
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:46,140
founded in 1608 by Archbishop Usher,

543
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,980
who famously calculated the creation of Adam

544
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,460
at nine o'clock in the morning

545
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,860
on the 6th of October, 4004 B.C.

546
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,140
And wrote this in a letter

547
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,780
to the Vice Chancellor of Cambridge University

548
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,260
and said, sir, I'm sorry,

549
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,700
I cannot give it more precisely than that.

550
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,940
And as I spoke in the speech day,

551
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,500
sitting beside me was the current Archbishop.

552
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,940
So I turned to him and I said,

553
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,620
you know, you like Archbishop Usher,

554
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,980
or both historians.

555
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,100
And Usher was actually a good historian.

556
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,740
But I suspect, I said, Archbishop,

557
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,700
that you differ by about seven orders of magnitude

558
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,500
in your calculation of the age of the earth.

559
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,540
And then I used that to speak to the kids at school

560
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,180
and their parents.

561
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,020
And I said one or two things,

562
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,780
but not what I'm about to say to you.

563
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,380
Now the word creationism,

564
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,500
creationists used to mean a person like me

565
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,860
who believes in a creator.

566
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,260
Now it has been narrowed semantically

567
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:56,260
to being a person who believes in a young earth theory.

568
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,820
Now, let me just hit this head on

569
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,740
and give you one or two arguments

570
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,540
why I'm not convinced of that.

571
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,020
And I'm not convinced of it,

572
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,860
mainly for biblical reasons.

573
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,340
Let me explain.

574
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,940
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

575
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,740
That's how Genesis starts.

576
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,900
You then get a sequence of days,

577
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,100
the six days of creation and God rest Sabbath.

578
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,420
The interesting thing about that text in Hebrew

579
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,540
is that the opening statement

580
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,300
is in one past tense in Hebrew

581
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,060
and it changes for the sequence of six days.

582
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,540
Now, in order to be fair,

583
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,420
I consulted the professor of Hebrew at Oxford

584
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,020
and the professor at Hebrew in Cambridge.

585
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,820
And to my amazement, they give me the same answer.

586
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,700
And it's best expressed, I suppose, by Jack Collins,

587
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,740
who was the lead Hebrew translator of the ESV,

588
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,860
also a trained scientist, which is interesting.

589
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,580
And I wrote to him about this

590
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,100
and I quote more or less,

591
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,700
I don't have it exactly in my memory.

592
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,660
He said, this tells you that the first statement

593
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,940
in the Bible occurs, quote,

594
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,420
at an indefinite period before the second group.

595
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,060
So what does the Bible say about the edge of the universe?

596
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,940
Absolutely nothing.

597
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,860
No matter what you believe about the days,

598
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,180
that is the interesting thing.

599
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,980
Now, I couldn't speak about the days,

600
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,660
but it would take too long.

601
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,860
But in order to satisfy people's curiosity,

602
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,140
I have a book, Revised Addition,

603
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,260
Seven Days that Divide the World.

604
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,580
Let me come to your last point.

605
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,480
The theory of evolution.

606
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,180
Well, there are many theories of evolution.

607
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,300
And biological evolution, as usually understood

608
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,580
by people like Richard Dawkins,

609
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,660
is that, and I'm partly quoting here,

610
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,740
natural selection, the blind automatic process

611
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,540
that Darwin discovered is the explanation

612
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,020
for the existence and variation of all of life.

613
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,300
That's a quotation from the blind watchmaker,

614
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,580
one of his most famous books.

615
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,780
Well, the first statement is false.

616
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,340
And he took many years to admit it.

617
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,740
Evolution, natural selection,

618
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,340
cannot account for the existence of life

619
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,660
for the most simple of reasons.

620
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,060
That natural selection, in order to do anything at all,

621
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,820
depends on the existence of life, to begin with.

622
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,740
So we can't explain it, full stop.

623
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,540
The origin of life does not come in

624
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,860
to the mandate of biological evolution,

625
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,220
as normally understood, unless you start to talk

626
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,300
about chemical evolution, which is completely different,

627
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,140
and there's nothing to do with selective processes.

628
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,540
And there's a lot to be said about that.

629
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,760
Secondly, neo-Darwinism, as it now is,

630
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,340
the neo adds the mechanism they believe, selection,

631
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,740
but these minor changes caused by mutation.

632
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,980
Now, number one, it's obvious that selection

633
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,660
and mutation do something.

634
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,740
Just have a look around this room.

635
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,460
Do we all look the same?

636
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,660
No.

637
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,500
Why?

638
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,260
Because there was selection.

639
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,300
I bet some of you did some selecting.

640
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,740
I did when I saw the lady that became my wife,

641
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,500
and I selected her, and marvelously, she selected me.

642
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,700
And that's why our children look like they do,

643
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,900
but they're different from everybody else.

644
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,900
Selection and mutation do something.

645
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,420
And from a Christian perspective,

646
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,380
we must see that that is something God has built

647
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,420
into the world.

648
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,180
As Paul pointed out to the Athenian philosophers,

649
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,180
God has made of one every race of human beings.

650
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,100
So that's okay, and what Darwin observed,

651
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,060
brilliantly observed, actually,

652
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,420
were minor variations on the theme.

653
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,340
But now comes the problem.

654
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,460
Does this selection and mutation mechanism

655
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,900
explain all the variation?

656
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,100
It is nothing to do with the origin of life,

657
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,260
but does it really explain,

658
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,700
does it do the work that's claimed of it?

659
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,220
Now, I'm very interested in this.

660
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,620
I'm not a biologist, but I have lived and soaked my mind

661
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,980
in biology for the last many years.

662
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,300
And I've got a friend in Oxford

663
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,500
who is an absolutely brilliant fellow

664
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,300
in the Royal Society, Professor Dennis Noble.

665
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,900
And he is really the driving force

666
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,660
behind what's called the third wave in biology.

667
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,980
And what are they saying now?

668
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,980
They're saying that neo-Darwinism is not fit for purpose.

669
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,220
It doesn't need to be modified.

670
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,480
It needs to be replaced.

671
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,060
The wheels are coming off this stuff,

672
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,180
but people don't know it,

673
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,460
which is why I've written just recently

674
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,940
a major book on this to try to introduce,

675
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,260
particularly to Christians, but not only.

676
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,620
What is going on at the top level in science?

677
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,020
The book is called Cosmic Chemistry,

678
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,940
Do God and Science Mix?

679
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,660
Now, don't misunderstand these people.

680
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,100
Many of them feel still

681
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,940
that there's going to be a naturalistic solution.

682
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,060
In other words, a solution that doesn't involve

683
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,940
a divine input of any kind,

684
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,980
but they're being much more honest now.

685
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,340
And the reason is that the levels of information

686
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,020
that we know to have been contained in the DNA,

687
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,100
the human genome, are now discovered

688
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,300
as only a small part of what's going on.

689
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:46,300
And the huge problem is that DNA and all these proteins

690
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,700
are dependent on the existence of the cell,

691
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,180
but the cell is dependent on them.

692
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,420
So you get a classic chicken and egg situation,

693
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,380
to which there's been no solution.

694
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,700
And now scientists are thinking much more

695
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,180
in terms of the cell.

696
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:07,900
And the cell is an absolutely unbelievably bewildering

697
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,100
complex of factories, microminature.

698
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,220
Now, it's not the fact that they contain information

699
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,220
that's the problem.

700
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,780
It's the nature of the information.

701
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,100
And really, it goes back to this.

702
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,580
The moment you see that, and it's only six letters,

703
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,340
you know there's a mind behind it.

704
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,180
So what I am suggesting is that within biology,

705
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,900
the evidence is mounting more and more

706
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,980
that there are many physical mechanisms involved.

707
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,820
Of course there are.

708
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,020
There's a big planet.

709
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,580
Life is extremely sophisticated once you get it going.

710
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,940
And clearly there are variations,

711
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,940
but when it comes to the existence of life itself

712
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,140
and all the major modifications,

713
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,900
it seems to me that there is increasing evidence

714
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:01,780
that you've got to factor in an intelligent mind

715
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,540
in order to get a full explanation.

716
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,300
Now, I know that's an assertion,

717
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,220
but I've tried to argue the case

718
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,380
and I put it out there in the public space.

719
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,020
So what you're saying, John, is that science

720
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,940
is not the only way to truth, which is actually scientism.

721
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,980
But on the flip side, we have fideism.

722
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,180
And Kirkegaard, the Danish philosopher,

723
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,060
was one of the proponents of this view.

724
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:32,060
And the Bible has a very interesting definition for faith

725
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,820
in Hebrews 11 and one,

726
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,820
which is an assurance about what we do not see.

727
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,100
And that's very interesting

728
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:47,100
because many atheists would say all faith is blind faith.

729
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,420
And also some Christians will say,

730
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,420
we do not enter into the kingdom of heaven by logic.

731
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,580
We do that by faith.

732
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:02,580
So the question is, what do you make of Dawkins' statement?

733
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,540
You quote Dawkins in your book, God's Undertaker.

734
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,380
And Richard Dawkins says this.

735
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,660
It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic

736
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:17,380
about the threat to humanity posed by the AIDS virus,

737
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,780
Matt Cowdy's disease and many others.

738
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,660
But I think that a case can be made

739
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,820
that faith is one of the world's great evils,

740
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:30,380
comparable to the smallpox virus, but how did he eradicate?

741
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,260
Faith, being belief that isn't based on evidence,

742
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,540
is the principal vice of any religion.

743
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,860
Is all faith blind faith?

744
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,620
Well, no, and I haven't forgotten

745
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,300
what you asked me about Harari.

746
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,140
I'll come back to that if I may.

747
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:51,140
Dawkins and his co-beligerents

748
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:57,180
have cleverly redefined faith and confused many people.

749
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,220
What he is defining as faith

750
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,420
is what most people call blind faith.

751
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,340
That is simply believing something

752
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,940
where there's no evidence.

753
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,940
Now, other religions must speak for themselves

754
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,820
and philosophies, but as far as Christianity is concerned,

755
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,500
scripture makes it abundantly clear

756
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:22,060
that the faith that Jesus and the apostles talk about

757
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,700
is evidence-based faith.

758
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,860
Now, you all know what that means.

759
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:30,060
If I asked you why you trusted certain people,

760
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,740
you'd say, well, because of this and this,

761
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,940
that is you give me evidence.

762
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,540
Why do you believe those facts

763
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,300
because of this and that evidence?

764
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,140
That's the common way to react

765
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,940
because believing without evidence

766
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,140
is a very risky thing to do.

767
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,900
But let's absolutely anchor this

768
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,380
because it is central.

769
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,740
John in his gospel explains why he wrote it.

770
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,020
And he says at the end, he says, many other signs,

771
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,900
the Greek term is semi-on, from which we get semiotics.

772
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,900
They're indicators of who Jesus was,

773
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,860
what we call his miracles.

774
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:10,420
Many other signs Jesus did in the presence of his disciples

775
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,340
which are not written in this book.

776
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:18,340
But these are written in order that you might believe

777
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,820
that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God,

778
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,420
and that believing you might have life in his name.

779
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,100
Now, notice very carefully what that says.

780
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,900
These are written that you might believe.

781
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,900
This is a basis, a set of evidences

782
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,820
on which you can ground your trust.

783
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,420
And your trust that Jesus is two things,

784
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,700
one, Hamashiach the Messiah, two, the Son of God,

785
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,420
and then on the basis of that,

786
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:55,260
you can have an experience of trusting him

787
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,980
which will bring you up to eternal life

788
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,300
as a gift from God on repentance and faith in him.

789
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,820
Now, that to my mind is crucially important.

790
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,860
Now, you mentioned sight,

791
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,060
and this is a very interesting thing.

792
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,500
We have a philosopher quite well known

793
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,660
called A.C. Grayling in this country.

794
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,220
And he was invited to do,

795
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,780
I think it was a guest editorial in New Scientist.

796
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,740
And he chose to point out in his article

797
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,460
that Jesus requires blind faith.

798
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,700
And I got the New Scientist at that time

799
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,900
and I thought this is gonna be very interesting.

800
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,380
So here I read, how does he prove

801
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,460
that Jesus requires blind faith?

802
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:44,460
Well, he goes to John 20 and relates the story of Thomas.

803
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:49,180
And he quotes the description where Jesus says to Thomas,

804
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,980
because you have seen, you have believed.

805
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,700
But happy or blessed are those rather

806
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,060
who have not seen and have believed.

807
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,300
And there you are, he says,

808
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,420
Jesus asked you to believe without evidence.

809
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,140
My reaction to that was, can the man not read?

810
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,740
Jesus didn't say blessed are those

811
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,260
that have no evidence and believe.

812
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,580
He said blessed are those that haven't seen.

813
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,620
I've never seen Jesus.

814
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,180
And nor have you, I suspect.

815
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,300
And why do we believe?

816
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,260
Have we no evidence?

817
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,180
We've got masses of evidence.

818
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,460
It's just we don't have the physical evidence

819
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,460
of seeing that Thomas had.

820
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,460
But seeing is only one of our five senses.

821
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,300
And there are all kinds of other evidences,

822
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,380
both physical evidences, historical, experimental,

823
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,540
and all the rest of it.

824
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,980
And this is incredible.

825
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,220
And it was even more incredible

826
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,820
because if he'd read the next few verses,

827
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,900
he would have come across what I quoted to you

828
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,380
two minutes ago.

829
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,420
These signs are written that you might believe.

830
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,420
It contradicts exactly how our brilliant philosopher

831
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,740
seems to understand scripture,

832
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,220
which shows to me something very serious.

833
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,460
That some of our atheist friends and colleagues

834
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,700
will not take evidence seriously.

835
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,540
Because they've made up their minds

836
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,820
that if it's Christian,

837
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,740
it's faith and faith is believing where you can't see.

838
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,100
A. C. Grayling wrote a very good book

839
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,220
about Wittgenstein, the philosopher.

840
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:22,900
But Wittgenstein said that you cannot explain

841
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,180
a system from within the system.

842
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,180
You need someone from outside the system

843
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,980
in order to be able to explain it.

844
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,540
Yes, Wittgenstein's statement is extremely important.

845
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,380
And in fact, Jonathan Sacks takes that up in his book.

846
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,660
But it must be fair to your question, Samuel,

847
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,580
and come back to Harari and the future

848
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,180
because it's actually important.

849
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,060
You mentioned his two agenda items

850
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,060
that are one, to solve the problem of physical death,

851
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:58,060
and two, to enhance human abilities and capacities

852
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,260
and essentially produce a superintelligence.

853
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,220
This is what's known as transhumanism.

854
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,700
And in my own University of Oxford,

855
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,620
they are driving this forward.

856
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,020
There are millions of dollars being put

857
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,500
into this area of research, by the way.

858
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,460
This is big stuff.

859
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:19,460
And artificial intelligence is very much a part of it.

860
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,060
Now, we could go into details, but I'm not going to

861
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,660
because I've actually written a book about it called 2084,

862
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,780
Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humanity.

863
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,940
But I will comment on these two things

864
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,060
because they fascinate me.

865
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,860
Because when people come to me and tell me

866
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,340
about this wonderful agenda,

867
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,740
we're going to solve the problem of physical death,

868
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,900
and we're going to enhance human intelligence

869
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,860
and give people some form of eternal life,

870
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,500
possibly upload their brains onto silicon

871
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,180
so that they won't be dependent on biology,

872
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,380
which perishes and dies and all this kind of thing.

873
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,700
I simply look at them and say, you're too late.

874
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,180
And they say, what do you mean you're too late?

875
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,060
Well, I said the problem of physical death

876
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,140
was solved 20 centuries ago

877
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,500
when God raised Jesus from the dead.

878
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,540
And that proves that death isn't the end,

879
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,420
but it's also solved your other desire.

880
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:15,300
Because Jesus raised from the dead is the Son of God,

881
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,260
and he was raised from the dead because he died.

882
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,060
Why did he die?

883
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,980
He died so that there would be a basis for God

884
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,900
to forgive us for the mess we've made of our own lives

885
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,620
and those of other people.

886
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,300
And if we trust him as Savior and Lord,

887
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,820
he promises that he's going to upload us,

888
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,100
not simply our brains or our mental capacities,

889
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,060
but there's going to be a physical resurrection

890
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,580
in the last day.

891
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,980
And I said, I'll go for that rather than transhumanism

892
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,180
because I think there's much more evidence to back it up.

893
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,460
So they're too late, but they need to hear that message

894
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,220
because they're not getting it,

895
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,540
not at all as far as I can see.

896
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,140
I think the resurrection, as you say,

897
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,500
is hugely important for Christians.

898
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,180
And that's a miracle.

899
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:08,180
And again, David Hume said that in ancient times,

900
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,860
and in the past, people would believe the miracles

901
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:14,020
because they didn't have a good understanding.

902
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,860
They didn't understand natural laws,

903
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,980
which is, I'm not sure if you agree with that,

904
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,980
but he also said that miracles are a violation

905
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,940
of natural law.

906
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,380
So what is your take on that?

907
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,220
And also, what evidence is there

908
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,580
for the miracles and the resurrection?

909
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,140
Well, my ancestry is Scottish,

910
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,340
so far from me to criticize a Scotsman like David Hume,

911
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,100
but he was wrong.

912
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:51,100
And I say that not because I'm a Hume expert,

913
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,820
but the most famous Hume expert that I ever met

914
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,540
was Anthony Flu, the philosopher,

915
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,740
who all his life, championed atheism,

916
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,140
like Richard Dawkins did,

917
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:07,140
until he came to see that the cell and human DNA

918
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:12,860
was a code and it spoke of intelligence.

919
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,220
And I had an interview with him,

920
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,220
not long before he died, and I asked him,

921
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,780
I said, what about David Hume and miracles?

922
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,980
He said, I was wrong,

923
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,140
and he made one of the most humble statements

924
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,740
I've ever heard from an academic.

925
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,420
He said, my books were wrong,

926
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,780
I'd have to rewrite them,

927
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,740
and I'm never going to have the chance.

928
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,460
But let's come to the substance of it,

929
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,460
that's just a little story.

930
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,140
Miracles violations of the laws of nature,

931
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:41,100
that's where the confusion lies.

932
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:46,100
Law has two meanings for most of us.

933
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,260
They're the laws of nature, what are they?

934
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,740
They are our descriptions of the mathematics,

935
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,240
of what normally happens.

936
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,700
The apple dropped, falls towards the center of the earth,

937
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,460
as Newton pointed out.

938
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:06,340
The planets revolve around the sun in elliptical axes.

939
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,500
But then there are those that say,

940
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,060
you must not drive in inner London

941
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,340
without paying a congestion charge.

942
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,700
And if you don't pay it, you're going to get clobbered.

943
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,420
That's a different kind of law.

944
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,140
They get totally confused.

945
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,620
Now Lewis, as usual, in his wonderful genius,

946
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,020
he went right to the heart of this,

947
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,700
in a most brilliant book,

948
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,580
which most people don't read

949
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,940
because they get stuck in the third or fourth chapter,

950
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,340
which is quite difficult.

951
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,140
They should leave it out and go to the next chapter.

952
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,740
But Lewis tells this illustration.

953
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,940
Here I am, I stay in London overnight,

954
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:47,420
and I put 50 pounds in the drawer, night one.

955
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,660
Night two, I put another 50 in, so that's 100 pounds.

956
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,740
I'm leaving on day three, I get up in the morning,

957
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,460
and I find a 10-pound note in the drawer.

958
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,220
So what do I conclude?

959
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,220
That the laws of arithmetic have been broken

960
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,460
or the laws of England?

961
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,500
Well, you're nothing, because you see,

962
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,340
I conclude the laws of England have been broken.

963
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,820
How do I know that?

964
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,860
Because the laws of arithmetic have not been broken.

965
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,180
You see?

966
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,300
It's the fact that the laws of arithmetic hold

967
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,940
that tell me that somebody's put their hand in

968
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,940
to what I thought was a closed system of cause and effect,

969
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,540
but it turned out not to be,

970
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,140
so a thief could put their hand in.

971
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,980
So that has helped me enormously,

972
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:42,140
because it really knocks you right out of the ballpark.

973
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,660
It shows that the confusion lies in the nature

974
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,140
of our concept of law.

975
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,140
The laws of nature are not like the laws of England.

976
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,340
Now here's the slightly ironic thing.

977
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,300
In order to recognize a miracle,

978
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,460
and the word miracle is slightly unfortunate,

979
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,540
because it's Latin, miraculum is a wonder.

980
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:06,060
What we're talking about is supernatural events

981
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:09,340
that give evidence that there is a supernatural.

982
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,660
Not everything that claims to be a miracle is one.

983
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,380
If I say it's a miracle that Jim passed his exam,

984
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,980
that isn't necessarily supernatural.

985
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,740
It's because he was a silly nitwit

986
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,380
and didn't do any work.

987
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,220
You see?

988
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,700
So we need to focus,

989
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,100
and that's why I focus on the resurrection.

990
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,660
This is the central claim that Jesus rose.

991
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,060
It's supernatural.

992
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,300
It's not simply that Jesus rose

993
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,460
as if it came from inside the grave.

994
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,060
It's God raised him from the dead.

995
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,500
It's power coming in from outside.

996
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,180
Now take a simple analogy.

997
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,860
If I pick this up and drop it,

998
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,900
the law of gravitation will tell me

999
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,900
it falls towards the center of the earth.

1000
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,780
That will not stop Samuel catching it.

1001
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,060
He can intervene and stop it.

1002
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,340
And it doesn't break the law of gravity.

1003
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:05,020
It changes the configuration of the situation.

1004
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:08,180
So at the larger level,

1005
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:13,100
God created a universe with regularities in it.

1006
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,380
If he hadn't done it that way,

1007
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:19,300
you wouldn't have been able to recognize a miracle

1008
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,740
if you saw one.

1009
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:25,060
If we didn't know the dead bodies normally remain dead,

1010
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:28,140
we wouldn't be the least bit surprised by resurrection.

1011
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,780
And the interesting thing is,

1012
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,220
it answers another thing of Hume's.

1013
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:36,020
Hume said, and you put it in your introduction

1014
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,900
to the question that in those days,

1015
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,980
people didn't know the laws of nature, didn't they?

1016
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,540
When Joseph was told by his fiance

1017
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,380
that she was pregnant,

1018
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,580
he didn't know where babies came from, did he?

1019
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,620
So he believed her.

1020
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,860
No, he didn't, because he knew exactly

1021
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,420
where they came from.

1022
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:56,940
And we read that because he was a righteous man,

1023
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,660
he wanted to divorce her quietly.

1024
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,260
He didn't want to expose her to public

1025
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:04,420
because he knew exactly what the law of nature was.

1026
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,820
And it took a special intervention of God

1027
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,940
speaking to that man and saying,

1028
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,100
Joseph, this is okay.

1029
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,060
This is holy.

1030
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,980
I'm behind this.

1031
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,260
The man born blind in John 9,

1032
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,460
it's a wonderful story.

1033
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,540
It's actually a humorous story.

1034
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,500
They said to him, well,

1035
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,940
you weren't the man who was blind

1036
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,500
or you weren't born blind, all this.

1037
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,020
And he said, look, let's cut all this out.

1038
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,500
Since the beginning of the world,

1039
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,980
it's never been heard that someone born blind

1040
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,500
has received their sight.

1041
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,780
So what has happened to me is unique.

1042
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,580
It must be supernatural.

1043
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,020
Of course they knew the laws of nature.

1044
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,340
And therefore, Hume was wrong on both those counts.

1045
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:48,860
So John, I want to come to the issue of the wording

1046
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,380
and the definition of apologetics

1047
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,220
because that's exactly what apologetics does,

1048
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,140
just what you did just now,

1049
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,540
explaining miracles and explaining the rationality of faith.

1050
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:03,700
But apologetics has nothing to do with being apologetic.

1051
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,740
It comes from the Greek word apologia,

1052
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,660
which means giving a defense of something.

1053
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,500
But at the same time,

1054
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,900
the second point I want to make, John, is this.

1055
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,540
Apologetics seems to explain things,

1056
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,620
but does that limit Christianity

1057
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:24,220
to only the things that we can demonstrate

1058
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,780
and explain apologetically?

1059
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,700
So what is apologetics

1060
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,380
and what are the limits of apologetics?

1061
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,860
Well, as you say, apologia is defense.

1062
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,180
But it's interesting if you do a word search

1063
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,620
to see where it's used in the New Testament,

1064
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:44,620
and it's mostly used by or about Paul.

1065
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:48,380
And his number one apologia defense is,

1066
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,740
I was on the Damascus Road

1067
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,380
and I met the risen Christ and he completely changed my life.

1068
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,820
That was his main apologetic.

1069
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,300
And that's why I don't like the word

1070
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,100
because it sounds like an apology.

1071
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,900
We should have translated it.

1072
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,820
All we did was take it straight out of Greek

1073
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,700
and transliterated it.

1074
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,780
But it's much better.

1075
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,500
I think Peter May's explanation of it is the best.

1076
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,740
It's persuasive evangelism.

1077
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,660
And the most persuasive thing about your experience

1078
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,300
if you're a Christian here tonight

1079
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,300
is your experience of Christ.

1080
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:23,980
So it's not just a question of reasoning.

1081
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:27,660
Although reason is involved at every level.

1082
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,380
Of course it is.

1083
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:34,380
Reason and faith are not an opposition.

1084
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,860
You need reason even to read the Bible.

1085
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:40,140
People get very confused about it.

1086
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:43,420
And one of the reasons for that confusion is

1087
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:46,460
they think that they called me an apologist.

1088
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,300
I don't like that.

1089
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,220
I try to persuade people and I use argument.

1090
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,980
But the key to the effectiveness of that

1091
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:59,260
is that when Paul stood up and reasoned in Athens

1092
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,580
and reasoned everywhere else

1093
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,380
and the Lord did it all the time,

1094
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,980
Paul was using his abilities but he wasn't trusting them.

1095
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,860
And the danger for Christians often with a high education

1096
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,740
is that they start to trust their reason

1097
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:18,660
and they use God when they get stuck.

1098
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,820
Real Christianity is to use our reason

1099
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,820
and all the abilities he's given us but to trust him.

1100
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,060
That's the key it seems to me.

1101
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:30,180
And that solves a lot of difficulties

1102
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:34,900
and we must beware that the arguments are all important

1103
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,080
but we trust God.

1104
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,780
And if we're trusting God we'll know

1105
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,900
how to move and detect whether questions

1106
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,220
are genuine or not, many are.

1107
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,740
Many people simply need the stones out of the way

1108
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,220
so that they can see clearly what the gospel is.

1109
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:56,220
But in the end, God is not a proposition.

1110
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,660
He's a person.

1111
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,140
Christ is not a set of propositions.

1112
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:05,700
He's a person so that what is being offered to us

1113
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,540
is a relationship of trust with a person.

1114
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,460
That's a huge thing.

1115
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,660
A relationship with the one who created the universe.

1116
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,900
And that for me is the biggest thing.

1117
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,540
And in this world where it's being attacked

1118
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:22,460
left, right and center, we need to know

1119
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:26,460
not simply what we believe but why we believe it

1120
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,220
because you cannot open your mouth

1121
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,820
in a multicultural, pluralistic society

1122
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,860
like what we've got here without people misunderstanding,

1123
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:39,340
misrepresenting or simply just being curious

1124
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,700
and we've got to answer.

1125
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:46,540
Always, said Peter, be ready to give an answer to people

1126
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:51,540
and a pologia to people who demand a reason

1127
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,620
for the hope that is within you.

1128
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,700
But do it with meekness.

1129
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,420
Justin Briley wrote a brilliant book

1130
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:05,020
called The Surprising Rebirth of Belief in God.

1131
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:09,100
And his main argument is that the new atheism

1132
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,780
wave is actually gone now and it's failed.

1133
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,740
And there's a lot of evidence to support that actually.

1134
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,340
And there's a new conversation coming on

1135
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,780
with new questions being asked

1136
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,020
that weren't asked 20 years ago.

1137
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,380
For example, what is the meaning of life?

1138
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:30,020
What is my identity and so on.

1139
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:35,020
Now, at the same time, we all know that Christianity,

1140
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:38,380
according to the last census, is going down

1141
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,500
and is not what it used to be.

1142
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:44,260
So it's declining in the Western societies,

1143
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:47,140
at least in Western Europe.

1144
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,820
But how do you reconcile the two views?

1145
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:53,460
And do you think there's a new wave of intellectuals,

1146
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,660
perhaps as Justin mentioned, people like Jordan Peterson,

1147
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,420
it was great to see you on his podcast,

1148
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,060
people like Louise Perry, Tom Holland and others

1149
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:07,060
who not only agree that Europe was based on Christianity

1150
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:10,980
and the foundation of Europe is Christian,

1151
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,740
but they also acknowledge and appreciate

1152
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,860
the social value of Christianity.

1153
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,740
How do you reconcile these two views?

1154
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:23,100
Well, first of all, I support your view of Justin's book

1155
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:27,700
and spare his blushes, but I would encourage you to read.

1156
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,980
This man has probably one of the most comprehensive

1157
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,420
experiences of entering the arena

1158
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,180
and getting both sides together to debate these things.

1159
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:40,540
And it is very worthwhile reading.

1160
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,860
And if you get anything tonight, get that book.

1161
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,180
That's number one.

1162
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:50,180
Number two, I think, is that I think he's right

1163
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:53,140
that the new atheism is waning

1164
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:58,140
and it's a belligerent kind of atheism that has dropped.

1165
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,860
There's another kind of vicious atheism

1166
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,900
that is keeping preville imprisoned

1167
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,940
in Xinjiang and China and all of that.

1168
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,980
We'll not go into that tonight,

1169
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:12,980
but it has changed and questions of meaning and identity

1170
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:17,580
are coming up to the fore in the population

1171
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:21,380
and young people, people want some kind of identity.

1172
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,780
That's a pressure coming in one direction.

1173
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,300
Then there are transhumanists in the other direction

1174
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:30,220
saying we're going to give you an enhanced identity,

1175
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:34,180
but it's going to involve bioengineering.

1176
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,700
It's going to involve you giving up a lot of things

1177
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:39,660
and we need to listen to C.S. Lewis in this.

1178
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:43,460
I would recommend to everybody to read a book

1179
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,340
that you mentioned earlier on, The Abolition of Man.

1180
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,340
It's a short book, but it's prescient.

1181
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:54,220
And Lewis saw in that book and in his science fiction novel,

1182
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:58,860
that hideous strength, that if a group of scientists

1183
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:03,860
get the capacity to modify human identity,

1184
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:08,220
for example, by messing around with the human genome

1185
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:14,780
and creating a heritable sequence

1186
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:19,260
where the specification of human beings will change forever.

1187
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:22,900
What they will produce are not human beings

1188
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,340
in the image of God, but artifacts.

1189
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,580
And he has got this chilling statement.

1190
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,780
He says, the final triumph will be

1191
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,780
of man will be the abolition of man.

1192
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:37,260
They won't be humans, they'll be beings of some kind.

1193
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,940
And I fear we're moving rapidly towards that

1194
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:43,820
because in my research of artificial intelligence,

1195
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,700
there's a disproportionate number of people driving it

1196
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:51,740
who are very strongly convinced of the atheist worldview.

1197
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:56,460
It's not worldview neutral, so we need to take that on board.

1198
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:59,780
And it's wonderful that we have particularly young people

1199
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:03,420
around who are communicating the gospel in a way

1200
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,980
that's got street credibility

1201
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,060
because it's bringing young people meaning.

1202
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,260
And we need to encourage people like that

1203
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,020
and develop their ability and give them a platform.

1204
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:16,420
But there are, as you say, some very interesting people

1205
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,900
around Jordan Peterson, but whom I interacted recently

1206
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:24,180
and it's on YouTube, is one of them

1207
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,780
who's moving incrementally, but moving clearly

1208
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:32,620
and on his own confession towards the Christian faith.

1209
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,700
Tom Holland, with whom I've interacted personally.

1210
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:39,980
Fascinating, brought up as an ancient historian

1211
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:42,060
and his book Dominion is Brilliant.

1212
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,340
But what it's devoted to is his change.

1213
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,900
He thought originally that all the good things

1214
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,100
in our society came from the Greeks and the Romans.

1215
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,700
He then discovered they came actually

1216
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,260
from the biblical worldview.

1217
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:01,940
And he has got a wonderfully powerful statement

1218
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,940
about the effect of the cross.

1219
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:08,220
It is quite remarkable to read, and that's another book.

1220
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,300
We're recommending lots of books tonight.

1221
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,940
Dominion Worth Reading.

1222
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,740
And there are a number of people, it seems,

1223
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,260
to be around the world who, intellectuals,

1224
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:20,620
public intellectuals, who seem to be moving step by step

1225
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:24,580
towards a full confession of the Christian faith.

1226
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,260
And there's then an outer group of people,

1227
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,060
and I keep meeting them who, although they're not

1228
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:33,540
that far yet, they are convinced that the materialism

1229
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:37,860
that dominates the academy and elsewhere is not enough.

1230
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:41,900
And they say to me, John, there must be something more.

1231
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,700
Well, that's a great start to realize

1232
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,420
there must be something more.

1233
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:48,140
That's a very good point because this new conversation

1234
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,500
opens the door to all things spiritual.

1235
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,980
And there's a new generation that's seeking meaning

1236
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:58,300
and looking beyond this world and seeking

1237
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:01,580
some spiritual meaning, even though that may not

1238
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,660
be Christianity.

1239
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:07,300
Now, as we close, John, there are many, many young people

1240
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,500
in this audience who still have doubts

1241
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,580
and feel there might be a tension between science

1242
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:14,820
and faith in God.

1243
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:18,420
What advice would you give to young people

1244
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,900
in the audience who may feel this tension?

1245
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:25,460
Don't duck the questions if they come up in your mind.

1246
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:27,220
That's the first thing.

1247
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:31,220
Because one of the reasons I'm sitting here as a believer,

1248
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:36,220
80 years old and a scientist, is that I've discovered

1249
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,380
in life there are answers.

1250
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:40,820
Sometimes you have to wait a bit, you have to do some work.

1251
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:44,660
But that's important, that the questions that bother you

1252
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:49,220
start to do a bit of reading, talk to other people,

1253
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:52,940
openly about your questions and your doubts.

1254
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:56,460
Because a large part of my Christian conviction

1255
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,460
has come from asking hard questions

1256
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,940
and waiting till I got answers.

1257
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,580
Now, I don't know whether I'm allowed to do

1258
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,540
a little bit of advertising,

1259
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:09,380
but I've been so concerned by this young people

1260
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,980
feeling this tension that this book,

1261
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,340
I was told this book, God's Undertaker,

1262
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,660
people found too difficult to read.

1263
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:20,620
So, I've done a much shorter one called

1264
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:23,020
Can Science Explain Everything?

1265
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:26,540
And some people are kind enough to say it has helped them,

1266
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,900
not only young people, but older people,

1267
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:33,460
to get some resolution to this tension.

1268
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:36,380
And I think the main resolution will come

1269
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:39,740
in the answer to the question that I did earlier,

1270
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:42,780
that the God explanation and the science explanation

1271
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,540
are different kinds of explanation.

1272
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:49,740
So, read and discuss this kind of thing,

1273
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,220
because there are answers that can ease you

1274
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,660
through that tension.

1275
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:59,660
You see, just think of a simple historical fact.

1276
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:04,660
Virtually all the great pioneers of modern science,

1277
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:08,900
starting with Galileo, Kepler, Newton,

1278
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,220
coming up through Faraday Clock Maxwell,

1279
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,300
they were all believers in God.

1280
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,540
And historians have noticed this,

1281
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:19,780
and C.S. Lewis put it beautifully as usual.

1282
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,540
And he summed it up this way.

1283
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,900
He said, men became scientific

1284
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,580
because they expected law in nature,

1285
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,100
and they expected law in nature

1286
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,980
because they believed in the legislator.

1287
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,660
I'm not ashamed of being a scientist and a Christian,

1288
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:39,660
because arguably, it was Christianity gave me my subject.

1289
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:43,300
You see, science, biology was started

1290
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,900
on page two of the Bible.

1291
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,820
Many people don't realize that.

1292
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:49,380
God named bits of the universe,

1293
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:52,020
but then he told the first humans,

1294
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,020
you go and name the animals.

1295
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,980
Taxonomy, naming things is the fundamental

1296
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,420
scientific discipline.

1297
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,260
God said, you go and do it yourself.

1298
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:01,940
And we've been doing it ever since.

1299
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:04,740
So, I think we've got a real mandate to do science,

1300
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:07,540
and to do it with God, not against God.

1301
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:09,260
John, there's a lot of wisdom in your thoughts.

1302
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,900
Thank you very much for your insights on science

1303
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:15,700
and faith in God, on evolution and creation,

1304
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:19,340
on the miracles, and it's great to have you with us.

1305
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:20,340
Thank you very much for your thoughts.

1306
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,900
Ladies and gentlemen, John Lennox.

1307
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:33,240
Let's kick off with a few of these very popular questions.

1308
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:37,100
So, you've spoken at length about science and faith

1309
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,420
this evening.

1310
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:40,300
But one of the most popular questions here is,

1311
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,780
do you think there could be other forms of life

1312
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,620
in the universe?

1313
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:44,940
And I suppose I would like to ask,

1314
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,900
and if there were, would it matter?

1315
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,020
I was asked, I was at a launch of a book

1316
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:55,420
by Professor Paul Davis, a physicist,

1317
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:58,260
and his book is called, Are We Alone?

1318
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:01,900
And I was interviewed, and I was being interviewed

1319
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:06,460
by a certain station called Premier Christian Radio.

1320
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:07,300
I don't know whether you remember.

1321
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,940
I remember the interview well.

1322
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,580
It was one of the first times I'd had you on the show,

1323
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,260
and I brought you on with Paul Davis.

1324
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:14,340
That's right.

1325
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,620
And Paul Davis said, as a scientist,

1326
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:20,220
he thought that we weren't alone, we were alone,

1327
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,940
but as a person, he hoped we weren't alone.

1328
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:26,900
And then I was asked, did I believe

1329
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:29,500
that there were other intelligence in the universe?

1330
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,580
And I said, yes, and one very big one called God.

1331
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,340
And quite seriously, from a Christian perspective,

1332
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:40,660
there are other intelligences in the universe.

1333
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:41,860
Of course there are.

1334
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:45,700
And God is the greatest one, but there are others,

1335
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,500
because we are told that there are beings,

1336
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:53,500
in some sense, above us, the Bible calls them spirit beings.

1337
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:58,420
They're not made of matters, we understand it,

1338
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,300
angels and so on.

1339
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:01,740
So there are others.

1340
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:06,740
This whole universe is much more complex than we think.

1341
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:11,980
And our vision, we don't see everything.

1342
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:16,380
So I think there are, and it does matter infinitely,

1343
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:20,260
because if we were the only intelligences around,

1344
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:24,060
we'd be left with the question as to where we come from.

1345
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,540
But because we know about God,

1346
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:29,940
then we've got a huge answer to that question.

1347
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,140
Thank you so much.

1348
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:35,060
From the sublime to the almost ridiculous,

1349
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:38,500
in this question, there are lots of theories

1350
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,900
in our internet age floating around.

1351
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,340
And interestingly, one of the ones

1352
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,860
that has sort of had a bizarre revival,

1353
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:48,260
is the idea that we're living on a flat earth.

1354
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:51,700
And this has been, this is the most popular question,

1355
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,020
according to the likes.

1356
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:56,180
What do you think about the flat earth debate, John?

1357
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,460
Nothing at all, really.

1358
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:00,580
I mean, but in all seriousness, there's, for me,

1359
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:03,580
it's a sign of the fact we live in an age

1360
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:06,380
where almost anything can get airtight on these days.

1361
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:07,220
And that's true.

1362
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:11,420
It wasn't a cheek, I should say, that if people reject God,

1363
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:13,380
they don't believe in nothing.

1364
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,300
They end up believing in anything.

1365
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:19,180
And it just shows there's masses of ridiculous things

1366
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:20,180
that people believe.

1367
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:22,260
And they don't believe in anything.

1368
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:26,140
And it just shows there's masses of ridiculous things

1369
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:27,380
that people believe.

1370
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,700
And that is the thing that staggers me,

1371
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,420
taking the question seriously.

1372
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,100
They will believe that kind of thing,

1373
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:36,260
where for which the evidence is all contrary.

1374
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:41,260
And yet, when it comes to seriously set forward

1375
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:44,420
arguments and reasons for believing in God,

1376
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:46,000
they won't even listen to them.

1377
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,540
There's a double think, and I would go as far as to say

1378
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,500
that there's a reason for it.

1379
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:56,980
There's a very interesting statement that Paul made,

1380
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:00,220
that the God of this world has blinded the minds

1381
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:02,500
of those who don't believe.

1382
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:07,500
That there is an enemy who sets the thought forms

1383
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:08,700
of the world.

1384
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:14,140
And Paul analyzes the intellectual darkness

1385
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:16,780
that comes about in Romans.

1386
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:20,980
When people reject God, they end up worshiping stones

1387
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,700
and inanimate things.

1388
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:26,260
They ascribe creatorial power to nature

1389
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,340
because they don't believe in God.

1390
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:31,780
And some of it is utterly absurd.

1391
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:33,300
And yet, that is what happens.

1392
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,300
And I would describe it as intellectual darkness,

1393
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,020
but there's an enemy behind it.

1394
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,820
Thank you.

1395
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:42,300
This is a very popular question.

1396
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,820
What do you think, why do you think Christianity

1397
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:49,020
is on the decline in Europe, especially amongst young people?

1398
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,860
That's very complex, I think, historically.

1399
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:57,340
You're probably better positioned to answer that than I am.

1400
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:01,740
There are roots in history going back to the enlightenment

1401
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:06,740
of the evils perpetuated by some professing branches

1402
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:09,940
of the Christian church have died hard.

1403
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:14,180
The fact that in the whole EU constitution,

1404
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:17,020
the word God has not mentioned at all,

1405
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:19,860
the fact that our major institutions

1406
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:23,640
are all of them virtually as Tom Holland

1407
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:26,340
and Jordan Peters and other people are pointing out

1408
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,340
are all traceable back to scripture,

1409
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:30,860
yet that's airbrushed out of history

1410
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:34,580
so that we are educating young people.

1411
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:37,020
We're, in that sense, brainwashing them

1412
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,100
and not telling them the facts

1413
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:42,140
so that they just don't know.

1414
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:46,500
And it's not surprising.

1415
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,900
You see, let me put it very crudely.

1416
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:51,780
If you tell people constantly, young people,

1417
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:54,140
that there's no meaning in life,

1418
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:58,380
they are simply animals, moderately sophisticated animals,

1419
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:00,860
they'll end up believing you.

1420
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:03,900
And therefore, their behavior will not be governed

1421
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,140
by any sense of morality.

1422
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:09,240
And it is frightening to read things like this.

1423
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,500
A class of students ask this,

1424
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,660
give an example of a moral dilemma.

1425
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:18,580
Answer, what is a moral dilemma?

1426
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:23,220
We are in serious trouble, folks,

1427
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,460
but I'm glad you said in Europe

1428
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,080
because there are other parts of the world

1429
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:30,180
where Christianity is growing and thriving

1430
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:32,860
and they are often the parts

1431
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:35,460
where there's been much more persecution.

1432
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,980
And then somebody pointed out to me the other day,

1433
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,980
if you take the whole of the Bible,

1434
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:42,420
how much of it was written at a time

1435
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:45,820
and there was no persecution and trouble, very little.

1436
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:48,940
And we have had an experience in Europe,

1437
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:51,220
at least until relatively recently,

1438
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:55,260
without war for an unusual period of time.

1439
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,060
And unfortunately, into the vacuum,

1440
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:02,940
there has poured all this kind of stuff,

1441
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:05,660
post-modernism, atheism, all the rest of it.

1442
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:08,180
And it has had an effect in our society.

1443
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:12,380
But please feel free to add to that, Justin,

1444
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,100
because from your perspective...

1445
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,700
I wouldn't disagree with anything

1446
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,220
that you've said there, John.

1447
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:20,500
I think that we are living in the wake,

1448
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,540
if you like, of many different forces

1449
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:25,500
that have led to the way in which religion

1450
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:29,100
is now seen as a private hobby, almost.

1451
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:32,380
And to that extent, it's part of the fact

1452
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:35,300
that our cultures are increasingly mobile, fluid.

1453
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,500
Many community institutions have broken down

1454
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,900
because of the focus on individualism in our culture.

1455
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,220
And so I think there's a lot of things.

1456
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:44,740
And alongside that goes, obviously,

1457
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:47,620
that this materialism, this story of materialism

1458
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:50,780
that obviously convinces people without good foundation,

1459
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:52,700
that there is no God and so on.

1460
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,260
I think I'm encouraged,

1461
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:56,460
and part of the story I tell in my new book

1462
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,900
is that actually people can only live on

1463
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:02,500
those thin versions of reality for so long, though,

1464
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,820
until actually people do start to come back and ask,

1465
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:07,180
is this the way life is meant to be lived?

1466
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,380
And I'm encouraged, actually,

1467
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:14,100
that I see a lot of young people almost,

1468
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:16,660
as we reach a point where

1469
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:19,780
there's almost no familiarity with the Christian story.

1470
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:21,500
One of the good things about that

1471
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,860
is that you don't have the assumption

1472
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:25,340
that you know what it is.

1473
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:27,660
And sometimes it's actually easier

1474
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:29,260
to start telling people what it is

1475
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:30,420
when they don't know anything about it,

1476
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:32,380
rather than those who think they know what it is,

1477
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:35,380
but actually have a rather false idea of it in their head.

1478
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:38,060
So I think we should be encouraged.

1479
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,700
I mean, let me skip to this question

1480
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,900
since we're talking about this.

1481
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,500
And this is obviously a lot of people here

1482
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,860
from the Romanian diaspora.

1483
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:49,420
And someone asked, what is your advice

1484
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:51,900
for the Romanian community specifically,

1485
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,580
the Christian Romanian community,

1486
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:56,780
for improving the belief climate in the UK?

1487
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:58,340
Any thoughts on that, John?

1488
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:04,020
Well, I have had the privilege of being in Romania

1489
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,540
several times.

1490
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:08,580
The first time I went, I was poisoned deliberately

1491
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:09,980
by the secret police.

1492
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,140
Wow.

1493
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:13,500
It nearly killed me.

1494
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,460
Gosh.

1495
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:17,580
And I look back to that and the Lord preserved me

1496
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:20,620
because I went to visit some marvelous Christians there,

1497
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:21,820
but I've been back since

1498
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:23,980
and they don't feed you poison anymore.

1499
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:27,900
And they don't have the poison.

1500
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:31,180
I think I could say,

1501
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:34,580
but you need to ask Samuel about that.

1502
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:37,620
They haven't been infected by all the poisons

1503
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:40,660
of atheism that we have in the West.

1504
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:43,220
So I think you've got,

1505
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:45,740
and what I saw in my brief visits,

1506
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:49,780
you've got much more sense of togetherness as Christians.

1507
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,020
Well, let's ask a Romanian.

1508
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,460
Yes, I think Samuel needs to speak to this.

1509
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:55,260
You'd probably be very well positioned

1510
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:59,620
to this question of how the Romanian Christian community

1511
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:03,660
can specifically encourage belief in the West.

1512
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:06,140
Well, I think the Romanian diaspora community

1513
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:09,500
is very strong here in London and in the UK.

1514
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:12,380
There are many evangelical churches in London.

1515
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:13,780
And I think one of the reasons

1516
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:18,580
that Romanians believe in God and keep their faith,

1517
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:22,260
although they live in a very secularized society

1518
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:24,900
and culture is because of communism.

1519
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:29,900
And communism promoted atheism as the national ideology.

1520
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:34,180
And Romanians have lived this for several decades

1521
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:36,300
and experienced what that means.

1522
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,300
And it simply doesn't work.

1523
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:41,300
So that's one of the reasons that Romanians

1524
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,260
and Eastern Europe in general

1525
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:45,700
remained a very religious society.

1526
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,060
It still is.

1527
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:49,140
And I think Romanians

1528
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:51,420
and other international diaspora communities,

1529
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:55,020
such as the Polish diaspora community, for example,

1530
01:14:55,020 --> 01:15:00,020
can and may indeed revive Christianity

1531
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:05,540
and bring a new energy in terms of living faith

1532
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:08,380
in a secular culture as the UK.

1533
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,860
I think that's absolutely true.

1534
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:14,460
And I spent many years,

1535
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:18,820
I started going to Eastern Europe in 1976

1536
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:22,980
and traveled many times, particularly to Hungary, Poland

1537
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:25,300
and above all, East Germany.

1538
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:29,100
And I came to the conclusion that many of our modern day

1539
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,220
so-called new atheists or passainer

1540
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:37,220
have not got a clue about what atheism does to a culture.

1541
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:41,860
And as Romanians, you know,

1542
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:44,220
and because you know,

1543
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:48,700
you can be a force for enormous good in our society.

1544
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:51,260
When people start talking about these things,

1545
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,860
you could just say, just wait a minute,

1546
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,460
let me tell you what it was like

1547
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:57,660
to live under the Sicuritate and the secret police.

1548
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:01,060
And I saw this again and again in East Germany,

1549
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,420
which was almost Stalinist

1550
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,340
and I went there many times.

1551
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:09,060
You've got a huge contribution to make.

1552
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:11,260
And I think Samuel's absolutely right.

1553
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:15,780
And I would encourage you to be a source

1554
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:19,860
of pushback against this kind of thing.

1555
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:24,860
I remember once talking in Russia actually in Siberia

1556
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,820
to an academician about the difference

1557
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:30,060
between the East and the West.

1558
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:34,140
And he said, in the both parts of the world,

1559
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:38,380
you've got materialism, you've got the material, we haven't.

1560
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:41,740
But it's the same philosophy.

1561
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:44,140
And that's the tragedy,

1562
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:47,380
the stuff that you were taught under Marxism

1563
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:52,380
is very little distance below the surface

1564
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:56,580
of some of the leading intellectuals in the West today.

1565
01:16:56,580 --> 01:17:00,140
It's the same materialism as a philosophy,

1566
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:02,060
but it's mixed with the consumerism

1567
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:03,940
that you didn't have in those days.

1568
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:06,180
And because you know what it's like

1569
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:10,820
to be deprived of many things because of an ideology,

1570
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:13,500
the Christian ideology or worldview

1571
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,340
is much more precious to you

1572
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,740
because of what it's done

1573
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:19,860
until you've a huge contribution to make.

1574
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:21,940
Just before we go to a question from the floor,

1575
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,620
there's just one more that links really well

1576
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,860
in with what you've just been talking about, John,

1577
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:27,340
which is Andrew, who asks,

1578
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:29,300
can you share with us a short story

1579
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,420
from your experience before 1990

1580
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:35,140
behind the Iron Curtain that could help our faith?

1581
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:37,460
Because this is a fascinating aspect of your life

1582
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:40,260
that perhaps not that many people know that you moved

1583
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:44,460
and worked among people in Soviet Russia and so on.

1584
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:48,300
Yes, well, before 1990, I wasn't in Russia.

1585
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:53,060
I went there first in 1989, 1990.

1586
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:56,780
But let me go years before that to East Germany.

1587
01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:00,700
And I'll tell you one story of a girl called Esther.

1588
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:03,020
And she was a very bright girl.

1589
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:05,980
She'd been top of her class in school.

1590
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:08,340
And I happened to be there.

1591
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:09,500
I'm a German speaker.

1592
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,660
That's why I could move easily in East Germany.

1593
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:17,020
And she came home from school weeping her heart out

1594
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:18,660
while we were there.

1595
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,660
And we said, Esther, what's wrong?

1596
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,980
She said, the teacher has just told me,

1597
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:25,860
I've got to leave school and go and work

1598
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:27,820
in a slipper factory.

1599
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:32,820
Now, this girl had been top of her class in every year.

1600
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:37,780
But at the age of 13, she was asked to take

1601
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:42,780
an oath of public allegiance to the atheistic state.

1602
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:48,140
And she said, I'm a Christian, I can't do that.

1603
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,300
And she was crying.

1604
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,100
And we were weeping with her.

1605
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:54,180
But I said, Esther, what did you say to the teacher?

1606
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:56,220
I'll never forget her answer.

1607
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:59,780
She said, Uncle John, I said to the teacher,

1608
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:04,540
sir, one day you will stand before God

1609
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:08,700
and you will answer for what you've done to me this day.

1610
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:10,140
I never forgot that.

1611
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:14,480
It's steeled me to redouble my efforts

1612
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:19,480
to fight this ideology for the rest of my life.

1613
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:22,260
And that's what I've tried to do with God's help

1614
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:27,260
to fight what is driving the most extreme things

1615
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:28,660
on the planet.

1616
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:31,420
And one of them is the persecution of the Uighurs.

1617
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:36,420
But all this kind of stuff comes from not a rejection

1618
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:39,420
of God, but a hatred of God.

1619
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:43,340
And just that one thing encapsulates it.

1620
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:44,460
Wonderful.

1621
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,460
Let's have a question here.

1622
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:49,500
Many wars are fought in the name of God.

1623
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:52,820
If God really cares, why is he allowing these things

1624
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:53,980
to happen?

1625
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:56,860
In the next is even many lives are lost

1626
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,660
in natural disasters, innocent lives.

1627
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,500
Where is God when all these things happen?

1628
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,340
Well, thank you.

1629
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:06,300
That's the hardest question you can ask.

1630
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:11,300
It's the hardest question for anyone of any worldview,

1631
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:15,180
the problem of evil and suffering.

1632
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:19,660
And I would want really to be fair to your question

1633
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:22,780
to have an hour to talk about it at least

1634
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:25,500
because there are no simplistic answers to this.

1635
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,720
But I'll try and say something briefly.

1636
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:33,160
You referred very briefly and concisely to two problems.

1637
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,880
There's a problem of moral evil,

1638
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:39,080
the bad things people do to one another, wars,

1639
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,800
as we see it horribly these days.

1640
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:45,120
Then there's a problem of what's called natural evil,

1641
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,120
which is a bit of a misnomer.

1642
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,280
And that is catastrophes, diseases,

1643
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:54,760
cancers, tsunamis, earthquakes, all that kind of thing.

1644
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:59,480
Now, how do we face that?

1645
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,520
And I'm gonna cut to the middle of that

1646
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:06,680
and tell you where I begin to see a possibility.

1647
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,960
I've no simplistic answer because there isn't one.

1648
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,940
But there are two ways of looking at it.

1649
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:19,400
The person who's suffering sees it in a very different way

1650
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:23,800
from say me who's watching the suffering.

1651
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,320
In other words, cancer looks very different

1652
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:29,120
in the eyes of a young mother who's just been told

1653
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,200
she's got six months to live

1654
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:34,400
and in the eyes of the oncologist who's treating her.

1655
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,080
So there are two different sides

1656
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,320
and the person that's watching tends

1657
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,240
to have a more intellectual response.

1658
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,920
They're full of big questions.

1659
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,600
The other person is in utter pain

1660
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,480
and needs comfort and help and encouragement.

1661
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:52,160
Now, how do we face it?

1662
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:55,240
Well, I'll tell you how I begin to face it.

1663
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:00,840
The way you formulated the question is a very common one

1664
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,960
and it's been there for centuries.

1665
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,160
If there's a good and all powerful God,

1666
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:10,480
how is it that the world is like this?

1667
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:14,240
Now, let me look at it from the theoretical perspective first

1668
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:17,480
because I'm afraid I'm a theorist, above all.

1669
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:20,560
And if you want me to tell you about suffering,

1670
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,640
just see me in the dentists.

1671
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:31,120
Seriously though, many people respond to this

1672
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,600
and say, therefore there's no God.

1673
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,120
And many of my friends do

1674
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,080
and I've been in Auschwitz many times

1675
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,560
and I've wept every time.

1676
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,000
It breaks my heart to see what's going on

1677
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,360
in a country that I love in Ukraine.

1678
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,040
Been there many times.

1679
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,040
All those cities, I know them all.

1680
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:52,280
So, how do we respond?

1681
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,760
Well, there's no God.

1682
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,080
Now, people that take that view

1683
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,160
think they've solved the problem.

1684
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:00,040
They've got rid of God, that's true.

1685
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:03,400
But they've also got rid by definition of all hope.

1686
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,960
The situation for them is totally hopeless

1687
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,920
but actually they've got rid of the problem of evil.

1688
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,280
Now, this is a more serious philosophical point.

1689
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,320
So if you don't like philosophy, go to sleep

1690
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,720
until you want to wake up.

1691
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,640
The whole concept of evil,

1692
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:25,280
I believe is directly related to the existence of God.

1693
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:28,280
Dostoevsky, the famous Russian novelist,

1694
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,440
said once, yes,

1695
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:34,440
he's not exist, everything is permitted.

1696
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:37,240
In other words, he didn't mean atheists can't behave.

1697
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:42,240
He meant there's no reason for believing in good and evil.

1698
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,120
And Richard Dawkins says exactly that.

1699
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,640
He says, this universe is just what you'd expected to be.

1700
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:52,160
If at bottom, there's no evil, no justice.

1701
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,960
DNA just isn't, we dance to its music.

1702
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,960
That's atheism, removing moral concepts.

1703
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,280
But that doesn't work because Dawkins

1704
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:05,440
doesn't even work for him because he knows he's a moral being

1705
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,120
and therefore he talks about the problem of evil.

1706
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:10,320
So there are many reasons that atheism

1707
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,160
doesn't work intellectually,

1708
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,960
but that's not going to help a person who's suffering.

1709
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,640
Come now to the other side very briefly.

1710
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,480
When I was a student, we used to have long discussions.

1711
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,680
Well, if God is all powerful and he's all good,

1712
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:29,480
and we never solved the problem, never.

1713
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:32,640
I've never heard a good answer to the solution.

1714
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,480
Now, I'm a mathematician

1715
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:37,160
and when mathematicians try for centuries

1716
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:40,360
to solve a problem, they usually ask themselves,

1717
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:43,840
are we asking the right question?

1718
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,560
So let me reformulate the question.

1719
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,440
What are we faced with?

1720
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,480
A mixed picture.

1721
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:54,920
I call it beauty and barbed wire.

1722
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,600
Beauty and bombs.

1723
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,280
We look out at the starry night,

1724
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:02,720
we see the Andromeda galaxy and it's absolutely magnificent

1725
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,680
and then we turn on the television

1726
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,840
and we watch what's happening in Ukraine.

1727
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,040
Beauty and bombs.

1728
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,960
We all have to face that.

1729
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:19,200
Now, how are we going to face that mixed picture?

1730
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:24,960
There's beauty, that's a mystery, if everything's evil.

1731
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,360
How is it that we get like that?

1732
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,760
And now I ask myself a question that's just as hard

1733
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,600
and it's this.

1734
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,440
We've all got to grant that it's a mixed picture.

1735
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:43,280
Is there any evidence anywhere

1736
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:47,720
that there's a God that we could trust with it?

1737
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,760
That's an equally hard question.

1738
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,720
But I believe that question brings us further

1739
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:58,240
and it takes us directly to the cross

1740
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:03,840
because the claim is, and I often say to people,

1741
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:07,440
please listen to what Christianity claims

1742
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,840
before you reject it.

1743
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:14,520
The claim is that the one on the cross is God himself,

1744
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:15,840
God incarnate.

1745
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,880
So what, if I may put it bluntly,

1746
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,800
is God doing on a cross, suffering?

1747
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:25,120
Well, it certainly means that he hasn't remained distant

1748
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:30,120
from our human suffering but has become part of it.

1749
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,120
That's the first thing, the heart of God revealed.

1750
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,800
Now of course, if that's where it ended,

1751
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,040
we'd never have heard of Jesus.

1752
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:43,400
The next bit is where the resurrection comes

1753
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,480
into central role.

1754
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:46,560
I would have no hope.

1755
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,280
I wouldn't be sitting here trying to answer your question.

1756
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:54,120
If I didn't believe that God had raised Jesus from the dead

1757
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:58,040
and that's where the hope comes in.

1758
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:03,040
You see, atheism is a hopeless faith, literally, hopeless.

1759
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,960
There's no hope.

1760
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,200
Now where can we get hope?

1761
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,800
What has the atheist got to say to the young mother

1762
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,160
with cancer?

1763
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,000
Nothing.

1764
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,600
Have I got anything to say as a Christian?

1765
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,200
I can't promise her that she'd be cured

1766
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,760
although we know God has the power to do it.

1767
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,960
But what I can bring to her is a message of hope

1768
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:29,960
that she can have a personal relationship with Christ

1769
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:34,240
that will transcend death and have something

1770
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:36,760
therefore to leave her children with.

1771
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:41,680
Now, I was in Christchurch, New Zealand,

1772
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:47,880
the same week as the earthquake and I spoke about this.

1773
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:52,400
And when I'd finished, a huge audience,

1774
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,280
one of the biggest that they'd seen in the church

1775
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:58,920
for many years, there was a note left for me from a lady

1776
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:01,520
and it just said, I lost my husband last week.

1777
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:07,640
And she said, what you said is the first glimmer of hope

1778
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:10,760
I've got, glimmer of hope.

1779
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,360
And I believe scripture analyzes this very carefully.

1780
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,560
I haven't time to go into it in detail, sir,

1781
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:23,560
but in John 11, there is the story

1782
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,240
of what happens when people suffer.

1783
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,960
Lazarus died.

1784
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:31,720
The sisters expected Jesus to be there and cure him.

1785
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:34,960
He wasn't there, Jesus let the man die

1786
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,360
and it nearly brought them to doubt the love of God.

1787
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:41,360
And when he eventually came and Lazarus was dead,

1788
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:46,440
the sister said, if you'd been here, he wouldn't have died.

1789
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,240
And then he suddenly told Martha,

1790
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:51,320
I am the resurrection and the life.

1791
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:56,080
Now that whole story, I believe, shows us how this problem

1792
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:00,440
on the one side can lead people to doubt the love of God,

1793
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:03,480
but how Christ answers it by being the resurrection

1794
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:04,320
on the life.

1795
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:07,880
My final point is, I've tried to put this together

1796
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:10,600
briefly in a little book that circled the world.

1797
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:14,960
It's called, Where is God in a Coronavirus World?

1798
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,360
But that'll have to do for that.

1799
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,320
Well, thank you so much.

1800
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:21,520
With apologies to the many other people

1801
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,960
who have wanted to ask a question in person,

1802
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,560
because time is drawn to a close,

1803
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,560
I'm just gonna finish with a final question from Slido, John.

1804
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,000
And this is, well, I'm gonna give you two actually,

1805
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,600
because I think they're substantially the same question,

1806
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,000
both very popular.

1807
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,360
Someone asks, when Muslim people do what we do,

1808
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,200
which is believing what they're taught by their parents

1809
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,240
carrying on their faith,

1810
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,320
what makes them wrong and thus right?

1811
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,600
And to sum up that question, someone else asks,

1812
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:55,120
how do you prove that Christianity is the true religion

1813
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,480
and other religions are false?

1814
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,760
Thanks for that.

1815
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:04,760
I'm glad to hear that question because it's important.

1816
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:09,080
I never try to answer that question without saying this.

1817
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:13,480
When we start to talk about the differences

1818
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,400
between religions, there is huge danger

1819
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,280
of looking down at other people.

1820
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:26,320
Now, it is very important to go back to something

1821
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:31,000
that Samuel said in our interview.

1822
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Every man, woman on the planet is a person of infinite worth

1823
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,920
made in the image of God.

1824
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,320
And often you'll find that in essence,

1825
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:49,920
the differences between religions are not moral differences.

1826
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,800
They are differences in what people believe

1827
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,120
about how you relate to God.

1828
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:02,480
And you will find that many of our Muslim friends

1829
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:07,480
and Hindu friends and others have a strong moral code.

1830
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,320
Why is that?

1831
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,440
From where I sit, it's because they're made

1832
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,280
in the image of God, they're moral beings.

1833
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:18,480
And scripture tells us clearly that pagans

1834
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:22,760
can sometimes put professed believers in God to shame.

1835
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:27,080
Abraham in particular, the father of faith

1836
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:32,080
and a pagan Egyptian pharaoh had a higher moral standard

1837
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:33,080
than he did.

1838
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:37,320
Now, it's so important to say that

1839
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:40,680
because the moment you start to critique,

1840
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:45,680
people think you're better than they are morally or not.

1841
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,680
My atheist friends could put me to shame

1842
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,760
and you know Christians have been caught out

1843
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:54,700
in all kinds of things.

1844
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:58,800
So we need to be very careful that we first recognize

1845
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,000
that the people we're talking about are made

1846
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,160
in the image of God and therefore,

1847
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,760
as creatures of God have infinite value.

1848
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:11,720
Once we've said that, we can now come to the next question

1849
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,600
because there's respect there.

1850
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:17,520
The second point is, well, let me take the three great

1851
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:20,920
monotheistic religions or we'll be here all night.

1852
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,280
Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

1853
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:28,120
Now, you could leave Christianity out.

1854
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,280
Judaism and Islam are not going to agree

1855
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:36,080
about, well, what is central to Christianity?

1856
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,280
It might as well bring it in again.

1857
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:42,600
Think of Jesus or Esa as Muslims call him.

1858
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:46,820
Yeshua, as the Jews call him.

1859
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:51,500
My Jewish friends believe that he died and didn't rise.

1860
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,180
My Muslim friends believe he didn't die.

1861
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,920
I believe he died and rose.

1862
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,640
Those three things cannot be simultaneously correct.

1863
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:05,760
And when I find, I talk about this in public,

1864
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,880
my Jewish and Muslim friends are nodding.

1865
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:09,160
They agree.

1866
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:12,480
They just do not agree on what is central.

1867
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,720
Now, how are you going to decide it?

1868
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:17,760
Well, I know of no other way on a matter of evidence

1869
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,640
and then we discuss that.

1870
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:23,400
But there's another approach and that is this.

1871
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:27,120
And this is, I think, the crux of the matter.

1872
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:30,440
People often say to me, you know, you're a scientist

1873
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:32,840
and you talk about evidence for God, the universe

1874
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:35,280
and all that's marvelous, but you're a Christian.

1875
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:39,640
How do you bridge the gap between belief in God

1876
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:43,840
as the God of the universe and a specifically Christian

1877
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:44,840
message?

1878
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:48,820
Well, I say, let's look at it this way.

1879
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:54,880
The heart of Christianity is rather different

1880
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,280
from what many people expect.

1881
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:01,800
And if I am to explain that, I often ask people,

1882
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,680
I say, first of all, tell me what a religion is.

1883
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:07,000
What do you think a religion is?

1884
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,780
And I come up with a little illustration of it.

1885
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:12,560
I often put it to them and say,

1886
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,960
is your view of religion like this?

1887
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,760
You've got a ceremony at the beginning,

1888
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,760
some sort of initiation that puts you on a path.

1889
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:23,920
And I usually draw a wavy line ups and downs.

1890
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:26,720
And you stay on the path, the sick full path

1891
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:29,600
or whatever it is, the way, et cetera.

1892
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,680
And you've got various people to help you,

1893
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:35,160
priests, gurus, imams, all the rest of it.

1894
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:39,040
And then you come to a gate at the end,

1895
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:42,120
where I draw some scales of justice.

1896
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:46,120
And at the end, you're faced with an assessment

1897
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:50,280
of your behavior and your deeds up to that point.

1898
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:54,160
And if you pass the grade, you get accepted

1899
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:58,560
into whatever it is, nirvana, heaven, or whatever.

1900
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:02,440
And most people will tell me that is what we believe.

1901
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:05,000
And I say, perhaps the best way to think about it

1902
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,520
is like a university course.

1903
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:12,360
You have an entrance and then you study at the university,

1904
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,800
every university in Britain

1905
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,580
and around the world works this way.

1906
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:18,320
The professors may be the best in the world,

1907
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:21,400
but they cannot guarantee you a degree.

1908
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:22,240
Why?

1909
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:25,520
Because the whole principle of universities

1910
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:29,320
is you get a degree on the basis of your merit.

1911
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:33,800
And if you don't earn it, merit it, you don't get it, yes?

1912
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,080
And many people say, yes, that is religion.

1913
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,860
I've been told that by hundreds of people.

1914
01:35:38,860 --> 01:35:41,880
Well, I said, you see, that isn't Christianity.

1915
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,880
And they say, oh, yes, it is.

1916
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,000
Now, here's where the problem lies.

1917
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,560
Many people think that Christianity is like that.

1918
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,600
You pile up your good deeds, you try and please God,

1919
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:58,320
and you hope at the end that he won't take his law too seriously

1920
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,960
and will let you in.

1921
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,880
But you see, it's not like that, folks.

1922
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:07,920
Christianity, the acceptance is not

1923
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:12,160
at the end of the journey of the judgment.

1924
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:16,720
It's at the beginning of the journey at the cross.

1925
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:19,160
Now, this is utterly revolutionary.

1926
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:26,000
In that sense, Christianity is not a religion.

1927
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,280
It isn't.

1928
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,560
It certainly has a path and a way.

1929
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:37,520
But the path follows acceptance.

1930
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:40,080
It doesn't come before it.

1931
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:43,960
Because the unique thing about Christianity

1932
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:48,200
is that at the very beginning, what Jesus offers me

1933
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:52,560
is that if I repent, that is, turn away

1934
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,320
from the mess I've made of life, and maybe other people's

1935
01:36:55,320 --> 01:37:01,200
lives, sadly, and trust him as Savior and Lord who died for me,

1936
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:04,600
then he will give me then, right then, the acceptance.

1937
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,760
That's hugely important.

1938
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:13,280
You see, let me give you an illustration.

1939
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,560
This is so important because I meet dozens of people

1940
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,560
that don't understand this.

1941
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:23,680
Even in this country, 56 years ago now, nearly,

1942
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:25,080
I met a girl.

1943
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,280
She was lovely.

1944
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:30,720
So I decided I'd like to marry her.

1945
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:34,640
So I came along, and I gave her a lovely present.

1946
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,600
It was wrapped up, and I said, Sally,

1947
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,360
I'd like you to be my wife.

1948
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,480
Now, here's the present.

1949
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:44,000
So she opened it, and it was a cookbook.

1950
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:50,520
So I said, read page 153.

1951
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,240
Apple cake.

1952
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,640
Thou shall take so much flour.

1953
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,600
Thou shall take so much sugar.

1954
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:59,880
Thou shall put it in the oven and bake it, and so on.

1955
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:05,040
Now, I said, my dear, I would like you to take this book.

1956
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:07,560
And if you keep these rules, let's say,

1957
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:11,840
let's be reasonable, for the next 40 years,

1958
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,800
then I will accept you.

1959
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:19,840
Otherwise, you can go back to your mother.

1960
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,240
Why are you laughing, folks?

1961
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:27,080
That is how millions of people think about God.

1962
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:32,080
You would never insult a fellow human being.

1963
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,200
And I mean this very seriously.

1964
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:39,000
You would never insult a fellow human being

1965
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,720
by making acceptance dependent on their performance.

1966
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:46,000
Do you think God does that?

1967
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,720
That's turning God into a monster.

1968
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:48,760
And that's why you laughed.

1969
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:49,760
It's ridiculous.

1970
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,120
Of course, I didn't do that.

1971
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:55,720
Now, the amazing thing is she accepted me.

1972
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:57,840
It's not amazing that I accepted her,

1973
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,920
but it's amazing she accepted me.

1974
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,280
And what does that do?

1975
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,680
Does that mean she doesn't care about how she lives

1976
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:05,880
and how she cooks?

1977
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,840
Of course not.

1978
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:13,080
But she's not cooking to earn my affection.

1979
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:16,960
She's cooking because she's got it.

1980
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:20,160
And here am I tonight talking to you, interviewing.

1981
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,880
Why do you think I do it?

1982
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:24,800
Do you think I'm doing it to earn brownie points

1983
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,480
that God will accept me, not at all?

1984
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,800
I'm doing it because I know my acceptance

1985
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:32,360
doesn't depend on it.

1986
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:33,560
And that's the difference.

1987
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:34,760
Now, let me put it this way.

1988
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:37,240
So it's really sharp in your minds.

1989
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:42,040
And it could help you to explain this to people.

1990
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:47,160
Christianity does not compete with any other religion.

1991
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:48,920
Why not?

1992
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:51,320
Because Jesus offers me something.

1993
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:54,280
None of them offer me.

1994
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:59,120
So it's a no-brainer here to accept from him something

1995
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:00,680
that nobody else offers me.

1996
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:04,240
Nobody else offers me forgiveness on such terms

1997
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:07,240
and acceptance and love at the very beginning

1998
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,360
and a relationship.

1999
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:11,960
And that's the reason I'm a Christian.

2000
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:12,960
Thank you.

2001
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:13,960
Thank you.

2002
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:14,960
Thank you.

2003
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:15,960
Thank you.

2004
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:16,960
Thank you.

2005
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:17,960
Thank you.

2006
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:18,960
Wow.

2007
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:19,960
Thank you so much.

2008
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:20,960
Thank you.

2009
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:21,960
Thank you again.

2010
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:22,960
Thank you again to John.

2011
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:23,960
Thank you to Samuel.

2012
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:30,520
And just as we close out, Virgil is going to come and give us

2013
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:33,960
a little bit of a welcome and some thank yous as well.

2014
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,080
Yes.

2015
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:38,160
Well, we've had a wonderful evening.

2016
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:39,160
Do you agree?

2017
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:40,160
Yes.

2018
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:41,160
Yeah.

2019
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,160
Good.

2020
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:43,880
We want to thank Samuel and Practical Wisdom

2021
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:48,000
for this wonderful conference.

2022
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,320
We started talking about this in May.

2023
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:53,840
And little did we know that we'd come and end up in

2024
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:58,440
Central London filling a famous place like this with so many

2025
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:03,280
young people and Romanian people interested to hear from an English professor

2026
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:07,200
from Oxford born in Ireland.

2027
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:10,640
Then again, we want to thank Professor Lennox for this extraordinary

2028
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:13,880
and very enlightening evening.

2029
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:17,960
We want to thank the organizer, the Ezra Christian Center, and its

2030
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:22,440
wonderful contributors in terms of finance, energy, and time.

2031
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:25,760
Also a warm thank you to our generous sponsors.

2032
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:29,360
Without her this evening would not have been possible.

2033
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:34,560
And I'm going to quickly read their names and please do applaud.

2034
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:38,480
We want to thank Holy Trinity Romanian Church in Kingsbury, Holy River

2035
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:43,560
Church in Pinner, Connected Life Church in Birmingham, Life Spring

2036
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:51,640
Community in London, Zion Brother in Church in Stratford, Bethel

2037
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:56,320
Brother in Church in Kenton, Christchurch in Layton, Harvest Church

2038
01:41:56,400 --> 01:42:00,720

01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:09,920
Conference, and the Romanian Pentecostal Church in Slough.

2041
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:13,280
We cannot conclude this list without expressing our heartfelt gratitude

2042
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:18,920
to Westminster Chapel for their very generous offer of this premises

2043
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:20,160
for the evening.

2044
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:25,600
They've been very kind to us and they've been very helpful in every respect.

2045
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:28,680
And thank you of the AV team from this place as well.

2046
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:41,480
We often read in Romania books written by C.S.

2047
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:49,800
Lewis, books by John Lennox and many books by Martin Lloyd Jones.

2048
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:52,960
Here we are tonight in the very place where he preached.

2049
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:59,400
I want to point out that we had people tonight coming as far as Scotland,

2050
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:03,800
the West of England, and some even from Romania.

2051
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:05,160
So well done, guys.

2052
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:15,360
Often forgotten and overlooked, I want to commend our wonderful volunteers

2053
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:20,080
who have worked for the whole afternoon here to arrange the chairs to make this

2054
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:24,120
meeting possible, and they will be working long into the night after all

2055
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,520
this is going to be over.

2056
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:26,720
Please do applaud them.

2057
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,720
Thank you.

2058
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:40,280
Obviously, we cannot not mention God.

2059
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:48,720
Now, as you have been already invited, I reiterate the invitation.

2060
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:53,000
And do go and buy books, lots of books.

2061
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,240
Make them travel light back home.

2062
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:57,240
Spend money.

2063
01:43:57,240 --> 01:44:02,320
It's going to be money well spent by Justin's books as well.

2064
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:09,360
Do give generously to Practical Wisdom and the Future Projects that this wonderful podcast

2065
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:12,800
is going to undertake in the future.

2066
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,800
Thank you.

2067
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:14,800
Thank you for being here.

2068
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,400
Thank you, Professor Lennox.

2069
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:17,400
Thank you, everyone.

2070
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:18,400
And thank you, Lord.

2071
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:20,080
Thank you so much.

2072
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,080
Thank you.
