00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Let's take the first point where you said

00:03.000 --> 00:06.440
science has explained how the universe came to be.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.640
It hasn't.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.840
And that was the surprise I found

00:09.840 --> 00:13.040
in reading Hawking's more recent book.

00:13.040 --> 00:16.400
I was quite amazed to read the following key sentence

00:16.400 --> 00:17.240
in the book.

00:17.240 --> 00:18.480
It goes like this.

00:18.480 --> 00:21.480
Because there is a law like gravity,

00:21.480 --> 00:25.480
the universe can and will create itself from nothing.

00:25.480 --> 00:28.800
And that was the reason he gave for saying we don't need God.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.760
But just think of the statement.

00:30.760 --> 00:33.600
Because there is a law like gravity,

00:33.600 --> 00:35.960
that is because there is something.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.120
The universe will create itself from nothing.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.320
That's a flat contradiction before you start.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.200
Good evening, everybody.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.880
How are you doing?

00:51.880 --> 00:52.760
Good to see you.

00:52.760 --> 00:54.960
Welcome to Westminster Chapel.

00:54.960 --> 00:58.320
And to what I'm sure will be a really, really interesting

00:58.320 --> 01:01.960
conference this evening, the Practical Wisdom Conference.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.880
We're talking, of course, this evening

01:03.880 --> 01:07.200
about faith in the age of science.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.680
Very often in our era, many people, especially atheists,

01:11.680 --> 01:15.080
have claimed that science effectively disproves God.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.320
Well, someone who has been answering those atheists

01:17.320 --> 01:21.040
directly for a number of years is, of course, John Lennox.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.640
John is a well-known Christian thinker.

01:23.640 --> 01:25.880
He is emeritus professor of mathematics

01:25.880 --> 01:29.040
and the philosophy of science at the University of Oxford.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.600
And I've had the privilege of interviewing

01:31.600 --> 01:33.480
and bringing John into conversation

01:33.480 --> 01:36.600
with many skeptics over many years.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.520
Myself, my role here is that I've

01:38.520 --> 01:42.160
been hosting conversations between skeptics and Christians

01:42.160 --> 01:43.080
for a number of years.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.480
In fact, over 15 years, some people

01:45.480 --> 01:47.280
know me from The Unbelievable Show, which

01:47.280 --> 01:49.840
I hosted for 17 years or more.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.920
And I'm currently engaged in some new projects.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.920
And I'll be excited to tell you about those as well a little

01:54.920 --> 01:56.760
later on in the evening.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.240
But really, you're here to obviously see and hear

01:59.240 --> 02:00.880
from John Lennox.

02:00.880 --> 02:03.640
So I'd like to invite both Samuel and John

02:03.640 --> 02:06.040
to join me on stage as they begin this evening.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.440
Do give them a round of applause.

02:07.440 --> 02:21.880
Welcome everyone to Practical Wisdom,

02:21.880 --> 02:23.480
and thank you very much for joining us.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.800
My name is Samuel Maruska, and today we're

02:25.800 --> 02:29.760
going to be talking about faith in God and science.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.720
And there's no one better suited to have this conversation

02:32.720 --> 02:36.040
with than Professor John Lennox.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.120
John, it's great to have you with us.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.600
Welcome to Practical Wisdom.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.240
Well, thank you very much, Samuel.

02:42.240 --> 02:46.400
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.120
I'd just like to say how grateful I

02:49.120 --> 02:53.320
am to Samuel and the team that have organized this,

02:53.320 --> 02:59.560
because as Justin has just said, getting public discussion

02:59.560 --> 03:04.640
on the big ideas is increasingly important

03:04.640 --> 03:08.720
as our culture disintegrates by various influences that

03:08.720 --> 03:10.760
come around.

03:10.760 --> 03:14.320
Now, I want to encourage you to read Justin's book

03:14.320 --> 03:16.520
afterwards, and I want to tell you

03:16.520 --> 03:21.200
that Samuel is a formidable interviewer,

03:21.200 --> 03:23.160
and that we have not colluded.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.880
I don't know what he's going to ask me.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.560
So I sit here in fear and trembling,

03:28.560 --> 03:31.640
and look forward to the questions

03:31.640 --> 03:34.120
that he's going to put to me.

03:34.120 --> 03:38.760
John, you've engaged in many debates with intellectuals

03:38.760 --> 03:41.240
and really heavyweight thinkers, people

03:41.240 --> 03:45.080
like Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens,

03:45.080 --> 03:48.120
and many other influential atheists.

03:48.120 --> 03:52.440
Many people in this room will know you from these debates.

03:52.440 --> 03:56.520
Can you talk a little bit about these debates?

03:56.520 --> 03:59.600
Which one was one of the most remarkable one?

03:59.600 --> 04:03.520
And also, what insights have you gained

04:03.520 --> 04:04.560
from this experience?

04:07.480 --> 04:11.320
I suppose one of the most remarkable ones,

04:11.320 --> 04:14.200
and partly for a humorous reason,

04:14.200 --> 04:19.320
was the debate with Professor Peter Singer, who's

04:19.320 --> 04:21.520
one of the world's leading ethicists.

04:21.520 --> 04:26.000
And I was invited to debate him on his home turf that

04:26.000 --> 04:28.760
is in Melbourne City Hall some years ago,

04:28.760 --> 04:31.000
although he teaches at Princeton.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.160
And in the opening remarks, I'm always open with audiences

04:36.160 --> 04:39.200
and point out that my parents were Christian.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.440
And when he started, he said, well,

04:41.440 --> 04:45.600
there goes my main objection against all religion.

04:45.600 --> 04:49.880
People stay in the religion in which they were brought up.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.120
And when I heard that, I thought,

04:52.120 --> 04:54.720
this is going to be very interesting.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.600
Because when I got a chance to speak, I said, Peter,

04:58.600 --> 05:02.400
I told them about my parents.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.040
Tell me about your parents.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.880
Were they atheists?

05:05.880 --> 05:07.680
Yes, he said they were atheists.

05:07.680 --> 05:13.440
So I said, you stayed in the faith in which you grew up then.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.960
Oh, but he said, it isn't a faith.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.920
Oh, Peter, I said, I'm very sorry.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.200
I thought you believed it.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.920
And cyberspace went mad at that time

05:25.920 --> 05:29.160
that here was one of the world's leading thinkers who

05:29.160 --> 05:34.360
didn't realize that his atheism was a belief system.

05:34.360 --> 05:38.160
And you notice how carefully Dr. Mariska Samuel

05:38.160 --> 05:39.320
introduced this.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.800
He talked about faith in God.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.000
Because all people are people of faith.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.560
Everybody's got a worldview that they believe.

05:46.560 --> 05:50.400
And this really exposed one of the biggest problems

05:50.400 --> 05:52.880
we have in our culture, that Christians

05:52.880 --> 05:54.720
are regarded as people of faith.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.320
That means they believe that there's no evidence.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.200
But atheists, they're not people of faith.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.680
They're rational.

06:00.680 --> 06:04.000
And fighting against that is one of the things

06:04.000 --> 06:06.320
I've been doing for a long time.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.080
What have I learned from it?

06:09.080 --> 06:11.600
That's hard to assess.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.080
I've learned that it's pretty scary debating

06:14.080 --> 06:16.720
some of these people, certainly that.

06:16.720 --> 06:22.040
And also, it has confirmed my faith enormously.

06:22.040 --> 06:27.040
Because spending a lot of time unpicking these arguments

06:27.040 --> 06:30.360
as I grow older, I find them less and less intellectually

06:30.360 --> 06:31.920
impressive.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.400
But I think it's so important that we enter this debate,

06:35.400 --> 06:39.880
or we have shows like Justin has been doing for years,

06:39.880 --> 06:42.360
to allow people to see both sides of the debate.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.680
I think that's a very healthy thing.

06:44.680 --> 06:48.640
And it enables people to see that Christianity has actually

06:48.640 --> 06:52.000
got very powerful evidence to support it.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.040
And we need to know that evidence.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.120
So you mentioned faith there.

06:58.120 --> 07:01.200
And you obviously have very interesting ideas

07:01.200 --> 07:03.600
on faith in God and science.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.560
And the Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor

07:05.560 --> 07:07.840
has this secularization theory.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.080
And he wrote extensively about this.

07:10.080 --> 07:13.800
And he said, in ancient times, people

07:13.800 --> 07:16.520
needed God to explain supernatural things.

07:16.520 --> 07:20.160
So for example, if you had a solar eclipse,

07:20.160 --> 07:22.040
people in ancient times would think

07:22.040 --> 07:24.840
that would be the wrath of God manifested.

07:24.840 --> 07:28.240
But nowadays, that science has explained that.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.080
We don't need God anymore.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.280
So science has replaced God.

07:33.280 --> 07:34.800
We know there's no mystery there.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.640
We know how the planets move.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.760
We can explain what happens during a solar eclipse.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.720
And we can actually predict all of this next solar eclipse

07:42.720 --> 07:44.360
for the next 1,000 years.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.560
So science has replaced God.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.400
This is part of the secularization theory.

07:49.440 --> 07:53.360
And we live in a very secular society in the UK.

07:53.360 --> 07:57.480
And also, there's this God of the Gaps view,

07:57.480 --> 08:03.600
which says, and many atheists and thinkers will say,

08:03.600 --> 08:06.920
look, Christians are a bit of a bit,

08:06.920 --> 08:09.360
some perhaps more lazy thinkers.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.360
Because if they can't explain something,

08:12.360 --> 08:14.880
they just say, well, we can't explain it.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.840
Therefore, God did it.

08:16.880 --> 08:20.320
And this is the label that many atheists

08:20.320 --> 08:23.040
would put on Christian thought.

08:23.040 --> 08:27.200
What is your view on the God of the Gaps theory?

08:28.360 --> 08:31.160
Well, it may apply to some people,

08:31.160 --> 08:33.760
but I don't think it applies to me,

08:33.760 --> 08:34.800
as I tried to explain,

08:34.800 --> 08:37.800
but there are really two questions hidden there.

08:37.800 --> 08:41.720
There's this notion that God and science

08:41.720 --> 08:44.880
are alternatives in terms of explanation.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.720
For a long time, I couldn't understand

08:47.720 --> 08:50.920
why people as bright as Stephen Hawking

08:50.920 --> 08:52.600
constantly said to the public,

08:52.600 --> 08:55.600
you've got to choose between God and science.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.720
And I realized for a long time

08:58.720 --> 09:01.360
that part of the reason for that

09:01.360 --> 09:03.360
was they didn't understand

09:03.360 --> 09:05.640
the nature of scientific explanation.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.360
Now, that may sound like a very arrogant claim

09:08.360 --> 09:11.840
for me to make, but actually, it's quite simple.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.840
We need to realize that the God explanation

09:15.840 --> 09:17.280
and the science explanation

09:17.280 --> 09:19.560
are different kinds of explanation.

09:19.560 --> 09:22.440
And I often give a very simple example to illustrate it,

09:22.440 --> 09:25.160
that even some professors can understand.

09:25.160 --> 09:29.320
And it's this, why is the water boiling?

09:29.320 --> 09:31.200
Well, because the heat energy

09:31.200 --> 09:34.400
is agitating the molecules of water and is boiling.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.960
Well, that's a scientific explanation,

09:37.960 --> 09:40.480
but I could equally well say it's boiling

09:40.520 --> 09:42.200
because I want a cup of tea.

09:43.160 --> 09:46.360
Now, that is an agent, personal explanation.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.240
Now, think about those two explanations,

09:48.240 --> 09:51.560
they're different, but they do not compete,

09:51.560 --> 09:55.160
they do not conflict, they complement each other.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.800
And I often say to people,

09:56.800 --> 10:01.800
the God explanation is the agent type explanation.

10:02.320 --> 10:07.160
God is the explanation of why there is a universe at all

10:07.160 --> 10:10.120
and why there are scientists there to study it.

10:10.120 --> 10:13.800
He's not competing in that sense at all.

10:13.800 --> 10:17.680
And we need both, as I find most school children can say.

10:17.680 --> 10:22.680
The second thing is that many contemporary thinkers

10:23.040 --> 10:28.040
have lost the idea of a God who's a transcendent creator

10:28.720 --> 10:31.400
who upholds the universe.

10:31.400 --> 10:36.400
And they think of God in terms of the Greek God of thunder.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.920
They couldn't explain thunder, as you said,

10:39.040 --> 10:40.720
to the postulated God.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.720
It's very important to realize

10:43.720 --> 10:47.240
that the God of the Bible is not in that category.

10:47.240 --> 10:51.000
There's a brilliant writer in Oxford

10:51.000 --> 10:52.720
at one stage, Werner Yeager,

10:52.720 --> 10:55.840
who was an expert on the Greek gods and the Babylonian gods.

10:55.840 --> 10:59.000
And he made this point, which I think is very important.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.240
He said, all the gods of the ancient philosophies

11:02.240 --> 11:04.680
and religions are, quote,

11:04.680 --> 11:07.640
descended from the heavens and the earth.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.320
That is they were actually part

11:09.320 --> 11:11.840
of the original material cosmos.

11:11.840 --> 11:15.880
The God of the Bible created the heavens and the earth.

11:15.880 --> 11:19.580
So they're completely different categories.

11:19.580 --> 11:20.640
Now, with that as background,

11:20.640 --> 11:23.080
let me come to the heart of your question,

11:23.080 --> 11:25.760
which is the God of the gaps.

11:25.760 --> 11:29.480
Now, I'm allergic to this in the sense that

11:29.480 --> 11:31.320
I do not want people to think

11:31.320 --> 11:33.600
that I believe in a God of the gaps.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.200
So how do I deal with it?

11:36.200 --> 11:37.920
Well, in several different ways.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.880
I'm going to go for the easiest one.

11:39.880 --> 11:44.880
And it's this, that think of Isaac Newton

11:45.320 --> 11:48.360
and his wonderful law of gravitation.

11:48.360 --> 11:51.280
And I used to love explaining it to students

11:51.280 --> 11:54.080
how you get an equation with eight symbols in it.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.980
And from it, you could deduce the motion

11:55.980 --> 11:57.600
of the planets around the sun.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.520
It is just brilliant stuff.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.400
Now, when Newton discovered that,

12:03.400 --> 12:08.400
did he think, right, I have now got an equation

12:08.880 --> 12:12.520
that allows me to deduce the motion

12:12.520 --> 12:14.160
of the planets from it.

12:14.160 --> 12:17.040
I don't need God.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.200
No, he didn't.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.760
He wrote what was perhaps the most brilliant book

12:20.760 --> 12:23.680
in the history of science at Principia Mathematica.

12:23.680 --> 12:26.960
And he dedicated it to with the hope

12:26.960 --> 12:31.160
that thinking people would see in it evidence

12:31.160 --> 12:33.400
for the existence of a divine intelligence

12:33.400 --> 12:36.520
behind the universe, because his argument was this.

12:36.520 --> 12:41.520
I found this wonderful mathematical description

12:41.680 --> 12:44.520
of what goes on in between heavy bodies

12:44.520 --> 12:45.560
and how they move.

12:45.560 --> 12:48.520
What a brilliant God who did it that way.

12:48.520 --> 12:51.560
And it's exactly that in the way we normally think.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.120
If you know a lot about painting,

12:54.120 --> 12:57.120
you will see much more in a Rembrandt picture than I would

12:57.120 --> 13:00.920
who am pretty ignorant about art, although I like it.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.400
You can see the genius.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.720
If you're an engineer, you'll see much more

13:04.720 --> 13:08.040
in a Rolls-Royce engine than I possibly would,

13:08.040 --> 13:11.000
because you see the evidence.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.120
And to my mind, God is not a God of the gaps.

13:15.120 --> 13:20.120
He is the most powerful explanatory power

13:20.360 --> 13:24.760
to make sense of the whole thing.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.740
I'm a mathematician.

13:26.740 --> 13:29.720
The very fact that we can do mathematics to me

13:29.720 --> 13:33.280
is an indicator that this is a word-based universe

13:33.280 --> 13:34.520
to put it that way.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.720
The very fact that in biology,

13:36.720 --> 13:39.960
we've discovered the longest word, the human genome,

13:39.960 --> 13:43.680
3.4 billion letters in a chemical alphabet

13:43.680 --> 13:46.820
is evidence of an intelligent mind.

13:46.820 --> 13:50.620
That's not a mind of the gaps.

13:50.620 --> 13:52.660
It's the only thing that makes sense.

13:52.660 --> 13:54.180
Now, I'm looking around the room,

13:54.180 --> 13:55.460
but the lights are blind to me.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.380
Oh, yes, I see a word of their prayer.

13:57.380 --> 13:58.660
How very suitable.

13:58.660 --> 14:00.980
There are two, four, six letters.

14:00.980 --> 14:04.260
The moment you see that, what do you deduce?

14:04.260 --> 14:06.020
Well, you can see letters.

14:06.020 --> 14:08.260
They have meaning to you.

14:08.260 --> 14:09.820
You cannot explain that meaning

14:09.820 --> 14:11.660
in terms of the physics and chemistry

14:11.660 --> 14:14.580
of the paper and paint there.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.660
But the moment you see that,

14:16.660 --> 14:18.660
there are many mechanical processes

14:18.660 --> 14:21.420
that went in producing that sign.

14:21.420 --> 14:24.220
But you know, because that carries meaning,

14:24.220 --> 14:27.740
it's a word that behind it, there was a mind.

14:28.900 --> 14:31.540
Not a mind of the gaps,

14:31.540 --> 14:34.260
but a mind that's the only sensible explanation

14:34.260 --> 14:35.700
of what you're reading up there.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.420
It's that kind of argument to my mind

14:38.420 --> 14:40.940
that I find extremely convincing.

14:40.940 --> 14:43.900
So you talked about meaning there and semantics,

14:43.900 --> 14:45.660
and the word semantics,

14:45.660 --> 14:49.420
there's Richard and Ogden published this book in 1923,

14:49.420 --> 14:52.180
a hundred years ago, called The Meaning of Meaning.

14:52.180 --> 14:54.860
And it's a very popular book.

14:54.860 --> 14:59.340
And they talked about how language influences thought

14:59.340 --> 15:00.620
and affects thought.

15:00.620 --> 15:04.100
And they devised the semantic triangle,

15:04.100 --> 15:05.820
which is a model of meaning,

15:05.820 --> 15:09.180
which when you have the symbol or the sign,

15:09.180 --> 15:11.540
linguistic sign on one side,

15:11.540 --> 15:16.540
you have the actual thing in reality on the other side,

15:16.740 --> 15:18.300
which is the reference,

15:18.300 --> 15:20.460
and then you have at the top thought.

15:20.460 --> 15:24.580
And it's the relation and the causal relation

15:24.580 --> 15:28.100
and interactions of these three that give you meaning.

15:28.100 --> 15:31.300
This book actually was very influential in philosophy

15:31.300 --> 15:33.460
and also influenced C.S. Lewis

15:33.460 --> 15:37.140
in The Abolition of Man, published in 1943,

15:37.140 --> 15:41.420
in which he talked about objective moral standards

15:41.420 --> 15:43.220
and also natural law.

15:43.220 --> 15:47.580
So people and scientists sometimes say,

15:47.580 --> 15:51.380
look, there's this universe out there

15:51.380 --> 15:56.100
with millions of galaxies, with hundreds of thousands of stars,

15:56.100 --> 15:59.860
and they all dance together in a very interesting,

15:59.860 --> 16:03.900
in a beautiful rhythm because of the gravity law.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.820
But there is no meaning to that.

16:06.820 --> 16:11.700
And also, as a human being, which is, as humans,

16:11.700 --> 16:14.140
this is a microcosm.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.780
There's no meaning in our life either.

16:16.780 --> 16:19.220
Does meaning imply intelligent design?

16:20.340 --> 16:24.420
It's interesting that people should even say a thing like that.

16:24.420 --> 16:26.980
There is no meaning in it.

16:26.980 --> 16:28.740
And they expect me to understand

16:28.740 --> 16:30.260
the meaning of that statement.

16:33.300 --> 16:36.380
It's one of these incoherent things

16:36.420 --> 16:39.180
that people make statements

16:39.180 --> 16:44.180
and they are unconsciously accepting themselves.

16:44.820 --> 16:47.460
It's like, may I tell a little story?

16:47.460 --> 16:48.300
Please do.

16:48.300 --> 16:52.620
Sitting in my Oxford College beside a man who had a book

16:52.620 --> 16:56.340
and he was putting it on the table.

16:58.020 --> 17:01.300
And I could see its title was curious about semantics

17:01.300 --> 17:02.140
and so on.

17:02.140 --> 17:03.260
I said, what's your book about?

17:03.260 --> 17:05.660
But he said, this is a book that shows

17:05.660 --> 17:09.620
that there's no such thing as authorial intention.

17:10.540 --> 17:12.260
I said, pardon?

17:12.260 --> 17:15.180
I said, you mean if I read your book,

17:15.180 --> 17:19.140
I will understand that an author has no intention.

17:19.140 --> 17:20.340
He said, exactly.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.140
So I said, I'm not gonna read it.

17:23.420 --> 17:24.340
So he said, why not?

17:24.340 --> 17:27.420
Well, I said, it must apply to your book as well.

17:27.420 --> 17:28.580
But he never thought about it.

17:28.580 --> 17:29.580
He got very angry.

17:29.580 --> 17:30.700
He got up and walked out.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.580
We never saw him again.

17:32.580 --> 17:37.420
This is one of the weaknesses of this sort of loose,

17:37.420 --> 17:41.420
postmodern style talk that says,

17:41.420 --> 17:42.900
there's no such thing as truth,

17:42.900 --> 17:46.140
but they expect you to believe that statement as a truth.

17:46.140 --> 17:47.300
It goes too far.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.460
It goes right over the top.

17:49.460 --> 17:51.940
Now I'm very interested in the kind of way

17:51.940 --> 17:53.420
in which you pose that question

17:53.420 --> 17:56.780
because another person that influenced Lewis a lot,

17:56.780 --> 17:59.340
one of his inklings was Barfield.

17:59.340 --> 18:02.580
And Owen Barfield posed an interesting question.

18:02.580 --> 18:06.940
He said, why is it we live in a world

18:06.940 --> 18:10.980
where we understand how almost everything works

18:10.980 --> 18:13.500
and we know the meaning of nothing?

18:13.500 --> 18:15.900
Ed McGilchrist is a very interesting,

18:15.900 --> 18:18.460
he's a polymath really, he's a neuroscientist.

18:18.460 --> 18:21.180
But roughly speaking, he's been working

18:21.180 --> 18:23.580
on something we're all familiar with.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.980
When we say Jane, you know,

18:25.980 --> 18:29.540
she's a real left-brained nerd,

18:29.540 --> 18:33.460
always into computers and all this kind of thing.

18:33.460 --> 18:37.540
Whereas James, well, he's so right-brained

18:37.540 --> 18:40.620
with his head and arts and the clouds and so on.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.820
Left and right brain.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.180
Well, what Ian McGilchrist claims

18:44.180 --> 18:46.500
in his very interesting book, which is called,

18:46.500 --> 18:48.220
this is a very interesting title,

18:48.220 --> 18:51.180
the matter with things,

18:51.180 --> 18:54.620
is that there is substance to these differences

18:54.620 --> 18:57.060
between the two brain hemispheres.

18:57.060 --> 19:01.140
And roughly speaking, both brain hemispheres

19:01.140 --> 19:04.020
are involved in virtually every event

19:04.020 --> 19:06.340
in our brains and minds.

19:06.340 --> 19:10.180
But the differences are that indeed,

19:10.180 --> 19:12.980
there is this concentration in the left brain

19:12.980 --> 19:17.060
on rational thought, on analysis, on breaking things down.

19:17.060 --> 19:19.820
Whereas the right brain concerns itself much more

19:19.820 --> 19:23.660
with putting things into context and meaning.

19:23.660 --> 19:27.660
And he says this, for the last four or 500 years,

19:27.660 --> 19:30.260
we have neglected the right brain.

19:31.180 --> 19:34.060
So that we're living in a world

19:34.060 --> 19:36.940
where we know how most things work,

19:36.940 --> 19:39.180
but we understand the meaning of nothing.

19:39.180 --> 19:42.900
And when our late chief rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, read that,

19:42.900 --> 19:45.620
he had a light bulb moment and he wrote a book

19:45.620 --> 19:47.220
because of it, a very interesting book

19:47.220 --> 19:48.740
called The Great Partnership.

19:48.740 --> 19:51.700
But he put it this way, and I like this formulation,

19:51.700 --> 19:52.740
it's very helpful.

19:52.780 --> 19:57.780
He said, science takes things apart to see how they work.

19:58.100 --> 20:01.860
Religion puts them together to see what they mean.

20:01.860 --> 20:04.700
And it seems to me that captures something

20:04.700 --> 20:08.300
extremely important, that we need to focus

20:08.300 --> 20:10.300
on the meaning side.

20:10.300 --> 20:13.980
Because science is powerful precisely

20:13.980 --> 20:17.300
because it limits the questions it can answer.

20:17.300 --> 20:21.220
It cannot give us meaning and it cannot give us value.

20:21.260 --> 20:23.220
Einstein saw that years ago.

20:23.220 --> 20:26.860
He said you could talk about the ethical foundations

20:26.860 --> 20:29.340
of science, but you cannot talk about

20:29.340 --> 20:31.580
the scientific foundations of ethics.

20:31.580 --> 20:33.380
You have to look outside.

20:33.380 --> 20:36.100
And I always cite one of Richard Dawkins'

20:36.100 --> 20:38.620
favorite scientists, Sir Peter Bedouin,

20:38.620 --> 20:41.380
who said it's so easy to see.

20:41.380 --> 20:45.260
And this is hugely important because science is so powerful.

20:45.260 --> 20:49.140
It's so easy to see, he wrote, that science is limited

20:49.180 --> 20:52.740
because it cannot even answer the simple question

20:52.740 --> 20:54.180
of a child.

20:54.180 --> 20:55.740
Where do I come from?

20:55.740 --> 20:58.220
Where am I going and what is the meaning of life?

20:58.220 --> 21:03.220
And to answer those questions, we need to go to literature

21:03.300 --> 21:06.340
and I would add, well he added philosophy

21:06.340 --> 21:10.060
and I would add theology and a lot of other things as well.

21:10.060 --> 21:15.060
Because the fatal flaw in much so-called academic thinking

21:15.900 --> 21:18.820
is that people have come to believe

21:18.820 --> 21:23.420
that science is co-extensive with rationality,

21:23.420 --> 21:24.820
which is nonsense.

21:24.820 --> 21:26.740
History is a rational discipline.

21:26.740 --> 21:29.500
So is theology, so is economics,

21:29.500 --> 21:31.900
but they're not the natural sciences.

21:31.900 --> 21:35.020
If science and rationality were co-extensive,

21:35.020 --> 21:37.420
you'd have to close half the departments

21:37.420 --> 21:40.180
in every university in the United Kingdom.

21:40.180 --> 21:42.940
So that's how I'd begin to approach your question.

21:42.940 --> 21:45.380
So science doesn't really explain the things

21:45.380 --> 21:47.180
that we think it explains.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.020
No, that's important.

21:48.020 --> 21:49.260
It's very limited.

21:50.140 --> 21:53.780
Yes, but what you're hinting at there is even deeper

21:53.780 --> 21:58.260
because I used to think at school,

21:58.260 --> 22:00.780
because I was pretty naive then I suppose,

22:00.780 --> 22:04.340
that Newton's law of gravity explained gravity.

22:04.340 --> 22:06.020
It doesn't, you know.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.900
Nobody yet knows really what gravity is.

22:08.900 --> 22:11.100
Newton's law of gravitation gives you

22:12.100 --> 22:15.140
a mathematical capacity to calculate

22:16.140 --> 22:17.980
what happens when heavy bodies move

22:17.980 --> 22:19.500
in relation to one another,

22:19.500 --> 22:22.860
so accurately that it'll help you land a person on the moon.

22:22.860 --> 22:25.820
But Newton realized all those years ago

22:25.820 --> 22:29.020
that it doesn't tell you what gravity is.

22:29.020 --> 22:32.340
So even within science itself,

22:32.340 --> 22:36.140
a scientific explanation is rarely,

22:36.140 --> 22:38.980
if ever, a complete explanation.

22:39.860 --> 22:43.300
I focused in the last several years

22:43.300 --> 22:45.140
on the nature of explanation

22:45.140 --> 22:47.900
because I feel there's huge confusion about it.

22:49.300 --> 22:53.780
But science did explain how the universe came to be

22:53.780 --> 22:56.180
and also it conflicts,

22:56.180 --> 23:00.100
this conflicts with the Genesis account and creationism.

23:00.100 --> 23:04.020
I think this is a very important issue for Christians

23:04.020 --> 23:07.820
because science seems to have explained

23:07.820 --> 23:11.060
and seems to go against creationism.

23:11.060 --> 23:13.860
For example, some Christians say

23:13.860 --> 23:17.340
that the earth is only 6,000 years old.

23:17.340 --> 23:19.380
So science seems to have explained that

23:19.380 --> 23:22.140
and contradict that irrefutably.

23:22.140 --> 23:25.300
And then you also have statements in Genesis

23:25.300 --> 23:30.300
that man was created in the image of God, Imago Dei.

23:30.300 --> 23:34.340
And I think this is hugely important

23:34.380 --> 23:38.300
because this is the cornerstone of our Western civilization.

23:38.300 --> 23:42.220
Now Harari took this a step further

23:42.220 --> 23:45.100
in his book, Homo Deus, and said two things.

23:45.100 --> 23:49.060
One, we can enhance human life

23:49.060 --> 23:52.020
by using data information and AI

23:52.020 --> 23:55.460
very much based on Nietzsche's Ubermensch

23:55.460 --> 23:58.020
from the 19th century.

23:58.020 --> 24:01.580
And also the second point he made in his book was that

24:01.620 --> 24:04.580
death is only a medical problem

24:04.580 --> 24:09.100
and eventually science will help us overcome that as well.

24:09.100 --> 24:12.540
So the question is two pronged, I guess, John.

24:12.540 --> 24:17.540
One, does evolution and the general theory of evolution

24:19.580 --> 24:22.620
go against creationism?

24:22.620 --> 24:25.060
And also, what is your take?

24:25.060 --> 24:28.140
What does the image of God mean to you?

24:28.140 --> 24:30.300
It's actually a four pronged question

24:30.300 --> 24:34.420
I've worked out listening to you, or five even.

24:34.420 --> 24:37.340
Let's take the first point where you said

24:37.340 --> 24:40.780
science has explained how the universe came to be.

24:40.780 --> 24:41.980
It hasn't.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.180
And that was the surprise I found

24:44.180 --> 24:47.380
in reading Hawking's more recent book.

24:47.380 --> 24:50.740
I was quite amazed to read the following key sentence

24:50.740 --> 24:51.580
in the book.

24:51.580 --> 24:55.820
It goes like this, because there is a law like gravity,

24:55.820 --> 24:59.820
the universe can and will create itself from nothing.

24:59.820 --> 25:02.060
And that was the reason he gave for saying

25:02.060 --> 25:05.060
we don't need God, but just think of the statement.

25:05.060 --> 25:07.900
Because there is a law like gravity,

25:07.900 --> 25:10.300
that is because there is something.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.460
The universe will create itself from nothing.

25:12.460 --> 25:15.100
That's a flat contradiction before you start.

25:15.100 --> 25:16.660
But do scientists mean the same thing?

25:16.660 --> 25:19.580
For me, nothing means the absence of something.

25:19.580 --> 25:21.300
Do scientists mean the same thing?

25:21.300 --> 25:24.500
No, they have to redefine nothing

25:24.500 --> 25:27.260
as a quantum vacuum or something like this.

25:27.300 --> 25:32.060
And then they get into incredible complexities.

25:32.060 --> 25:34.300
I've written a book about this, by the way,

25:34.300 --> 25:36.460
called Seven Days and Divide the World.

25:36.460 --> 25:38.780
But let's just come back to the statement.

25:38.780 --> 25:40.780
Because it's worse than that.

25:40.780 --> 25:43.100
He says the universe will create itself.

25:43.100 --> 25:44.660
What on earth could that mean?

25:44.660 --> 25:46.420
Sorry, I didn't mean to put the earth in,

25:46.420 --> 25:47.660
because that's the point.

25:48.860 --> 25:52.740
The universe, if I say X creates Y,

25:52.740 --> 25:55.020
roughly speaking, you would understand me to mean

25:55.020 --> 25:57.340
if you've got X, you'll get Y.

25:57.340 --> 26:01.180
If I say X creates X, I think what that tells me

26:01.180 --> 26:03.300
is that nonsense remains nonsense,

26:03.300 --> 26:04.980
even if scientists write it.

26:05.940 --> 26:08.940
And as C.S. Lewis himself pointed out.

26:08.940 --> 26:12.020
So number one point in response to you.

26:12.900 --> 26:15.860
I don't believe science has told us

26:15.860 --> 26:18.420
how the universe came to be.

26:18.420 --> 26:21.100
It is certain theories of the etiology

26:21.100 --> 26:23.380
of the history of space-time.

26:23.380 --> 26:26.100
And as you say, a long time ago.

26:26.100 --> 26:28.180
So let's come up a little bit.

26:28.180 --> 26:32.020
Second point you mentioned was age of the earth

26:32.020 --> 26:32.980
and creationism.

26:32.980 --> 26:34.540
Now I must make a confession.

26:35.580 --> 26:37.340
Because a few weeks ago,

26:37.340 --> 26:41.260
I was speaking at the speech day in my own school,

26:41.260 --> 26:46.140
founded in 1608 by Archbishop Usher,

26:46.140 --> 26:50.980
who famously calculated the creation of Adam

26:50.980 --> 26:52.460
at nine o'clock in the morning

26:52.460 --> 26:55.860
on the 6th of October, 4004 B.C.

26:55.860 --> 26:57.140
And wrote this in a letter

26:57.140 --> 26:59.780
to the Vice Chancellor of Cambridge University

26:59.780 --> 27:01.260
and said, sir, I'm sorry,

27:01.260 --> 27:04.700
I cannot give it more precisely than that.

27:04.700 --> 27:07.940
And as I spoke in the speech day,

27:07.940 --> 27:11.500
sitting beside me was the current Archbishop.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.940
So I turned to him and I said,

27:12.940 --> 27:15.620
you know, you like Archbishop Usher,

27:15.620 --> 27:16.980
or both historians.

27:16.980 --> 27:19.100
And Usher was actually a good historian.

27:19.100 --> 27:21.740
But I suspect, I said, Archbishop,

27:21.740 --> 27:25.700
that you differ by about seven orders of magnitude

27:25.700 --> 27:28.500
in your calculation of the age of the earth.

27:28.500 --> 27:32.540
And then I used that to speak to the kids at school

27:32.540 --> 27:34.180
and their parents.

27:34.180 --> 27:36.020
And I said one or two things,

27:36.020 --> 27:38.780
but not what I'm about to say to you.

27:38.780 --> 27:42.380
Now the word creationism,

27:42.380 --> 27:46.500
creationists used to mean a person like me

27:46.500 --> 27:48.860
who believes in a creator.

27:48.860 --> 27:51.260
Now it has been narrowed semantically

27:51.260 --> 27:56.260
to being a person who believes in a young earth theory.

27:57.260 --> 28:00.820
Now, let me just hit this head on

28:00.820 --> 28:02.740
and give you one or two arguments

28:02.740 --> 28:05.540
why I'm not convinced of that.

28:05.540 --> 28:07.020
And I'm not convinced of it,

28:07.020 --> 28:09.860
mainly for biblical reasons.

28:09.860 --> 28:11.340
Let me explain.

28:11.340 --> 28:14.940
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

28:14.940 --> 28:16.740
That's how Genesis starts.

28:16.740 --> 28:19.900
You then get a sequence of days,

28:19.900 --> 28:24.100
the six days of creation and God rest Sabbath.

28:24.100 --> 28:27.420
The interesting thing about that text in Hebrew

28:27.420 --> 28:29.540
is that the opening statement

28:29.540 --> 28:32.300
is in one past tense in Hebrew

28:32.300 --> 28:36.060
and it changes for the sequence of six days.

28:36.060 --> 28:37.540
Now, in order to be fair,

28:37.540 --> 28:40.420
I consulted the professor of Hebrew at Oxford

28:40.420 --> 28:43.020
and the professor at Hebrew in Cambridge.

28:43.020 --> 28:45.820
And to my amazement, they give me the same answer.

28:46.740 --> 28:49.700
And it's best expressed, I suppose, by Jack Collins,

28:49.700 --> 28:53.740
who was the lead Hebrew translator of the ESV,

28:53.740 --> 28:56.860
also a trained scientist, which is interesting.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.580
And I wrote to him about this

28:58.580 --> 29:00.100
and I quote more or less,

29:00.100 --> 29:02.700
I don't have it exactly in my memory.

29:02.700 --> 29:07.660
He said, this tells you that the first statement

29:07.660 --> 29:09.940
in the Bible occurs, quote,

29:09.940 --> 29:14.420
at an indefinite period before the second group.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.060
So what does the Bible say about the edge of the universe?

29:17.060 --> 29:18.940
Absolutely nothing.

29:18.940 --> 29:21.860
No matter what you believe about the days,

29:21.860 --> 29:24.180
that is the interesting thing.

29:24.180 --> 29:25.980
Now, I couldn't speak about the days,

29:25.980 --> 29:27.660
but it would take too long.

29:27.660 --> 29:30.860
But in order to satisfy people's curiosity,

29:30.860 --> 29:33.140
I have a book, Revised Addition,

29:33.140 --> 29:35.260
Seven Days that Divide the World.

29:35.260 --> 29:37.580
Let me come to your last point.

29:37.580 --> 29:39.480
The theory of evolution.

29:39.480 --> 29:42.180
Well, there are many theories of evolution.

29:42.180 --> 29:46.300
And biological evolution, as usually understood

29:46.300 --> 29:48.580
by people like Richard Dawkins,

29:48.580 --> 29:51.660
is that, and I'm partly quoting here,

29:51.660 --> 29:55.740
natural selection, the blind automatic process

29:55.740 --> 29:58.540
that Darwin discovered is the explanation

29:58.540 --> 30:02.020
for the existence and variation of all of life.

30:02.020 --> 30:04.300
That's a quotation from the blind watchmaker,

30:04.300 --> 30:06.580
one of his most famous books.

30:06.580 --> 30:09.780
Well, the first statement is false.

30:09.780 --> 30:12.340
And he took many years to admit it.

30:12.340 --> 30:14.740
Evolution, natural selection,

30:14.740 --> 30:17.340
cannot account for the existence of life

30:17.340 --> 30:19.660
for the most simple of reasons.

30:19.660 --> 30:23.060
That natural selection, in order to do anything at all,

30:23.060 --> 30:26.820
depends on the existence of life, to begin with.

30:26.820 --> 30:29.740
So we can't explain it, full stop.

30:29.740 --> 30:33.540
The origin of life does not come in

30:33.540 --> 30:35.860
to the mandate of biological evolution,

30:35.860 --> 30:38.220
as normally understood, unless you start to talk

30:38.220 --> 30:41.300
about chemical evolution, which is completely different,

30:41.300 --> 30:45.140
and there's nothing to do with selective processes.

30:45.140 --> 30:47.540
And there's a lot to be said about that.

30:47.540 --> 30:51.760
Secondly, neo-Darwinism, as it now is,

30:51.760 --> 30:56.340
the neo adds the mechanism they believe, selection,

30:56.340 --> 30:59.740
but these minor changes caused by mutation.

30:59.740 --> 31:03.980
Now, number one, it's obvious that selection

31:03.980 --> 31:05.660
and mutation do something.

31:05.660 --> 31:07.740
Just have a look around this room.

31:07.740 --> 31:09.460
Do we all look the same?

31:09.460 --> 31:10.660
No.

31:10.660 --> 31:11.500
Why?

31:11.500 --> 31:13.260
Because there was selection.

31:13.260 --> 31:15.300
I bet some of you did some selecting.

31:15.300 --> 31:19.740
I did when I saw the lady that became my wife,

31:19.740 --> 31:23.500
and I selected her, and marvelously, she selected me.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.700
And that's why our children look like they do,

31:25.700 --> 31:27.900
but they're different from everybody else.

31:27.900 --> 31:30.900
Selection and mutation do something.

31:30.900 --> 31:33.420
And from a Christian perspective,

31:33.420 --> 31:37.380
we must see that that is something God has built

31:37.420 --> 31:38.420
into the world.

31:38.420 --> 31:42.180
As Paul pointed out to the Athenian philosophers,

31:42.180 --> 31:46.180
God has made of one every race of human beings.

31:46.180 --> 31:50.100
So that's okay, and what Darwin observed,

31:50.100 --> 31:52.060
brilliantly observed, actually,

31:52.060 --> 31:55.420
were minor variations on the theme.

31:55.420 --> 31:57.340
But now comes the problem.

31:57.340 --> 32:01.460
Does this selection and mutation mechanism

32:01.460 --> 32:03.900
explain all the variation?

32:03.900 --> 32:06.100
It is nothing to do with the origin of life,

32:06.100 --> 32:08.260
but does it really explain,

32:08.260 --> 32:10.700
does it do the work that's claimed of it?

32:10.700 --> 32:12.220
Now, I'm very interested in this.

32:12.220 --> 32:16.620
I'm not a biologist, but I have lived and soaked my mind

32:16.620 --> 32:19.980
in biology for the last many years.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.300
And I've got a friend in Oxford

32:22.300 --> 32:24.500
who is an absolutely brilliant fellow

32:24.500 --> 32:28.300
in the Royal Society, Professor Dennis Noble.

32:28.300 --> 32:31.900
And he is really the driving force

32:31.900 --> 32:35.660
behind what's called the third wave in biology.

32:35.660 --> 32:37.980
And what are they saying now?

32:37.980 --> 32:42.980
They're saying that neo-Darwinism is not fit for purpose.

32:43.780 --> 32:46.220
It doesn't need to be modified.

32:46.220 --> 32:49.480
It needs to be replaced.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.060
The wheels are coming off this stuff,

32:52.060 --> 32:54.180
but people don't know it,

32:54.180 --> 32:56.460
which is why I've written just recently

32:56.460 --> 32:58.940
a major book on this to try to introduce,

32:58.940 --> 33:01.260
particularly to Christians, but not only.

33:01.260 --> 33:04.620
What is going on at the top level in science?

33:04.620 --> 33:07.020
The book is called Cosmic Chemistry,

33:07.020 --> 33:08.940
Do God and Science Mix?

33:08.940 --> 33:11.660
Now, don't misunderstand these people.

33:11.660 --> 33:14.100
Many of them feel still

33:14.100 --> 33:17.940
that there's going to be a naturalistic solution.

33:17.940 --> 33:21.060
In other words, a solution that doesn't involve

33:21.060 --> 33:23.940
a divine input of any kind,

33:23.940 --> 33:26.980
but they're being much more honest now.

33:26.980 --> 33:31.340
And the reason is that the levels of information

33:31.340 --> 33:35.020
that we know to have been contained in the DNA,

33:35.020 --> 33:38.100
the human genome, are now discovered

33:38.100 --> 33:41.300
as only a small part of what's going on.

33:41.300 --> 33:46.300
And the huge problem is that DNA and all these proteins

33:47.140 --> 33:50.700
are dependent on the existence of the cell,

33:50.700 --> 33:53.180
but the cell is dependent on them.

33:53.180 --> 33:57.420
So you get a classic chicken and egg situation,

33:57.420 --> 33:59.380
to which there's been no solution.

33:59.380 --> 34:01.700
And now scientists are thinking much more

34:01.700 --> 34:03.180
in terms of the cell.

34:03.180 --> 34:07.900
And the cell is an absolutely unbelievably bewildering

34:07.900 --> 34:12.100
complex of factories, microminature.

34:12.100 --> 34:16.220
Now, it's not the fact that they contain information

34:16.220 --> 34:17.220
that's the problem.

34:17.220 --> 34:19.780
It's the nature of the information.

34:19.780 --> 34:22.100
And really, it goes back to this.

34:22.100 --> 34:26.580
The moment you see that, and it's only six letters,

34:26.580 --> 34:28.340
you know there's a mind behind it.

34:29.300 --> 34:33.180
So what I am suggesting is that within biology,

34:33.180 --> 34:35.900
the evidence is mounting more and more

34:35.900 --> 34:38.980
that there are many physical mechanisms involved.

34:38.980 --> 34:39.820
Of course there are.

34:39.820 --> 34:41.020
There's a big planet.

34:41.020 --> 34:44.580
Life is extremely sophisticated once you get it going.

34:44.580 --> 34:46.940
And clearly there are variations,

34:46.940 --> 34:50.940
but when it comes to the existence of life itself

34:50.940 --> 34:53.140
and all the major modifications,

34:53.140 --> 34:56.900
it seems to me that there is increasing evidence

34:56.900 --> 35:01.780
that you've got to factor in an intelligent mind

35:01.780 --> 35:04.540
in order to get a full explanation.

35:04.540 --> 35:06.300
Now, I know that's an assertion,

35:06.300 --> 35:08.220
but I've tried to argue the case

35:08.220 --> 35:10.380
and I put it out there in the public space.

35:10.380 --> 35:13.020
So what you're saying, John, is that science

35:13.020 --> 35:16.940
is not the only way to truth, which is actually scientism.

35:16.940 --> 35:20.980
But on the flip side, we have fideism.

35:20.980 --> 35:24.180
And Kirkegaard, the Danish philosopher,

35:24.180 --> 35:27.060
was one of the proponents of this view.

35:27.060 --> 35:32.060
And the Bible has a very interesting definition for faith

35:32.260 --> 35:34.820
in Hebrews 11 and one,

35:34.820 --> 35:39.820
which is an assurance about what we do not see.

35:40.460 --> 35:42.100
And that's very interesting

35:42.100 --> 35:47.100
because many atheists would say all faith is blind faith.

35:47.700 --> 35:50.420
And also some Christians will say,

35:50.420 --> 35:55.420
we do not enter into the kingdom of heaven by logic.

35:55.580 --> 35:57.580
We do that by faith.

35:57.580 --> 36:02.580
So the question is, what do you make of Dawkins' statement?

36:04.780 --> 36:08.540
You quote Dawkins in your book, God's Undertaker.

36:08.540 --> 36:10.380
And Richard Dawkins says this.

36:11.580 --> 36:13.660
It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic

36:13.660 --> 36:17.380
about the threat to humanity posed by the AIDS virus,

36:17.380 --> 36:19.780
Matt Cowdy's disease and many others.

36:19.820 --> 36:21.660
But I think that a case can be made

36:21.660 --> 36:25.820
that faith is one of the world's great evils,

36:25.820 --> 36:30.380
comparable to the smallpox virus, but how did he eradicate?

36:30.380 --> 36:34.260
Faith, being belief that isn't based on evidence,

36:34.260 --> 36:37.540
is the principal vice of any religion.

36:37.540 --> 36:39.860
Is all faith blind faith?

36:39.860 --> 36:41.620
Well, no, and I haven't forgotten

36:41.620 --> 36:43.300
what you asked me about Harari.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.140
I'll come back to that if I may.

36:46.140 --> 36:51.140
Dawkins and his co-beligerents

36:52.180 --> 36:57.180
have cleverly redefined faith and confused many people.

36:57.220 --> 36:59.220
What he is defining as faith

36:59.220 --> 37:02.420
is what most people call blind faith.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.340
That is simply believing something

37:04.340 --> 37:05.940
where there's no evidence.

37:05.940 --> 37:08.940
Now, other religions must speak for themselves

37:08.940 --> 37:13.820
and philosophies, but as far as Christianity is concerned,

37:13.860 --> 37:17.500
scripture makes it abundantly clear

37:17.500 --> 37:22.060
that the faith that Jesus and the apostles talk about

37:22.060 --> 37:24.700
is evidence-based faith.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.860
Now, you all know what that means.

37:26.860 --> 37:30.060
If I asked you why you trusted certain people,

37:30.060 --> 37:31.740
you'd say, well, because of this and this,

37:31.740 --> 37:33.940
that is you give me evidence.

37:33.940 --> 37:36.540
Why do you believe those facts

37:36.540 --> 37:38.300
because of this and that evidence?

37:38.300 --> 37:40.140
That's the common way to react

37:40.140 --> 37:41.940
because believing without evidence

37:42.060 --> 37:44.140
is a very risky thing to do.

37:44.140 --> 37:46.900
But let's absolutely anchor this

37:46.900 --> 37:49.380
because it is central.

37:49.380 --> 37:53.740
John in his gospel explains why he wrote it.

37:53.740 --> 37:58.020
And he says at the end, he says, many other signs,

37:58.020 --> 38:01.900
the Greek term is semi-on, from which we get semiotics.

38:01.900 --> 38:04.900
They're indicators of who Jesus was,

38:04.900 --> 38:06.860
what we call his miracles.

38:06.860 --> 38:10.420
Many other signs Jesus did in the presence of his disciples

38:10.420 --> 38:13.340
which are not written in this book.

38:13.340 --> 38:18.340
But these are written in order that you might believe

38:18.500 --> 38:22.820
that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God,

38:22.820 --> 38:25.420
and that believing you might have life in his name.

38:25.420 --> 38:28.100
Now, notice very carefully what that says.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.900
These are written that you might believe.

38:30.900 --> 38:35.900
This is a basis, a set of evidences

38:36.580 --> 38:39.820
on which you can ground your trust.

38:40.420 --> 38:43.420
And your trust that Jesus is two things,

38:43.420 --> 38:47.700
one, Hamashiach the Messiah, two, the Son of God,

38:47.700 --> 38:50.420
and then on the basis of that,

38:50.420 --> 38:55.260
you can have an experience of trusting him

38:55.260 --> 38:58.980
which will bring you up to eternal life

38:58.980 --> 39:03.300
as a gift from God on repentance and faith in him.

39:03.300 --> 39:06.820
Now, that to my mind is crucially important.

39:06.860 --> 39:09.860
Now, you mentioned sight,

39:09.860 --> 39:13.060
and this is a very interesting thing.

39:13.060 --> 39:15.500
We have a philosopher quite well known

39:15.500 --> 39:18.660
called A.C. Grayling in this country.

39:18.660 --> 39:20.220
And he was invited to do,

39:20.220 --> 39:23.780
I think it was a guest editorial in New Scientist.

39:23.780 --> 39:27.740
And he chose to point out in his article

39:27.740 --> 39:30.460
that Jesus requires blind faith.

39:30.460 --> 39:32.700
And I got the New Scientist at that time

39:32.700 --> 39:34.900
and I thought this is gonna be very interesting.

39:34.900 --> 39:37.380
So here I read, how does he prove

39:37.380 --> 39:39.460
that Jesus requires blind faith?

39:39.460 --> 39:44.460
Well, he goes to John 20 and relates the story of Thomas.

39:44.460 --> 39:49.180
And he quotes the description where Jesus says to Thomas,

39:49.180 --> 39:53.980
because you have seen, you have believed.

39:53.980 --> 39:56.700
But happy or blessed are those rather

39:56.700 --> 39:59.060
who have not seen and have believed.

39:59.060 --> 40:00.300
And there you are, he says,

40:00.300 --> 40:03.420
Jesus asked you to believe without evidence.

40:03.420 --> 40:06.140
My reaction to that was, can the man not read?

40:07.620 --> 40:09.740
Jesus didn't say blessed are those

40:09.740 --> 40:12.260
that have no evidence and believe.

40:12.260 --> 40:15.580
He said blessed are those that haven't seen.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.620
I've never seen Jesus.

40:17.620 --> 40:20.180
And nor have you, I suspect.

40:20.180 --> 40:21.300
And why do we believe?

40:21.300 --> 40:22.260
Have we no evidence?

40:22.260 --> 40:24.180
We've got masses of evidence.

40:24.180 --> 40:27.460
It's just we don't have the physical evidence

40:27.460 --> 40:29.460
of seeing that Thomas had.

40:29.460 --> 40:32.460
But seeing is only one of our five senses.

40:32.460 --> 40:35.300
And there are all kinds of other evidences,

40:35.300 --> 40:38.380
both physical evidences, historical, experimental,

40:38.380 --> 40:39.540
and all the rest of it.

40:39.540 --> 40:40.980
And this is incredible.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.220
And it was even more incredible

40:43.220 --> 40:45.820
because if he'd read the next few verses,

40:45.820 --> 40:47.900
he would have come across what I quoted to you

40:47.900 --> 40:49.380
two minutes ago.

40:49.380 --> 40:52.420
These signs are written that you might believe.

40:52.420 --> 40:56.420
It contradicts exactly how our brilliant philosopher

40:56.420 --> 40:58.740
seems to understand scripture,

40:58.740 --> 41:02.220
which shows to me something very serious.

41:02.220 --> 41:05.460
That some of our atheist friends and colleagues

41:05.460 --> 41:08.700
will not take evidence seriously.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.540
Because they've made up their minds

41:10.540 --> 41:11.820
that if it's Christian,

41:11.820 --> 41:14.740
it's faith and faith is believing where you can't see.

41:14.740 --> 41:17.100
A. C. Grayling wrote a very good book

41:17.100 --> 41:19.220
about Wittgenstein, the philosopher.

41:19.220 --> 41:22.900
But Wittgenstein said that you cannot explain

41:22.900 --> 41:25.180
a system from within the system.

41:25.180 --> 41:28.180
You need someone from outside the system

41:28.180 --> 41:29.980
in order to be able to explain it.

41:29.980 --> 41:33.540
Yes, Wittgenstein's statement is extremely important.

41:33.540 --> 41:37.380
And in fact, Jonathan Sacks takes that up in his book.

41:37.380 --> 41:39.660
But it must be fair to your question, Samuel,

41:39.660 --> 41:42.580
and come back to Harari and the future

41:42.580 --> 41:45.180
because it's actually important.

41:45.180 --> 41:48.060
You mentioned his two agenda items

41:48.060 --> 41:51.060
that are one, to solve the problem of physical death,

41:51.060 --> 41:58.060
and two, to enhance human abilities and capacities

41:58.060 --> 42:01.260
and essentially produce a superintelligence.

42:01.260 --> 42:04.220
This is what's known as transhumanism.

42:04.220 --> 42:06.700
And in my own University of Oxford,

42:06.700 --> 42:08.620
they are driving this forward.

42:08.620 --> 42:11.020
There are millions of dollars being put

42:11.020 --> 42:13.500
into this area of research, by the way.

42:13.500 --> 42:15.460
This is big stuff.

42:15.460 --> 42:19.460
And artificial intelligence is very much a part of it.

42:19.460 --> 42:22.060
Now, we could go into details, but I'm not going to

42:22.060 --> 42:25.660
because I've actually written a book about it called 2084,

42:25.660 --> 42:28.780
Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humanity.

42:28.780 --> 42:30.940
But I will comment on these two things

42:30.940 --> 42:33.060
because they fascinate me.

42:33.060 --> 42:35.860
Because when people come to me and tell me

42:35.860 --> 42:37.340
about this wonderful agenda,

42:37.340 --> 42:39.740
we're going to solve the problem of physical death,

42:39.740 --> 42:42.900
and we're going to enhance human intelligence

42:42.900 --> 42:45.860
and give people some form of eternal life,

42:45.860 --> 42:48.500
possibly upload their brains onto silicon

42:48.500 --> 42:51.180
so that they won't be dependent on biology,

42:51.180 --> 42:54.380
which perishes and dies and all this kind of thing.

42:54.380 --> 42:57.700
I simply look at them and say, you're too late.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.180
And they say, what do you mean you're too late?

42:59.180 --> 43:01.060
Well, I said the problem of physical death

43:01.060 --> 43:03.140
was solved 20 centuries ago

43:03.140 --> 43:05.500
when God raised Jesus from the dead.

43:06.460 --> 43:08.540
And that proves that death isn't the end,

43:08.540 --> 43:11.420
but it's also solved your other desire.

43:11.420 --> 43:15.300
Because Jesus raised from the dead is the Son of God,

43:15.300 --> 43:17.260
and he was raised from the dead because he died.

43:17.260 --> 43:19.060
Why did he die?

43:19.060 --> 43:22.980
He died so that there would be a basis for God

43:22.980 --> 43:25.900
to forgive us for the mess we've made of our own lives

43:25.900 --> 43:27.620
and those of other people.

43:27.620 --> 43:31.300
And if we trust him as Savior and Lord,

43:31.300 --> 43:34.820
he promises that he's going to upload us,

43:34.820 --> 43:38.100
not simply our brains or our mental capacities,

43:38.100 --> 43:41.060
but there's going to be a physical resurrection

43:41.060 --> 43:42.580
in the last day.

43:42.580 --> 43:45.980
And I said, I'll go for that rather than transhumanism

43:45.980 --> 43:49.180
because I think there's much more evidence to back it up.

43:49.180 --> 43:53.460
So they're too late, but they need to hear that message

43:53.460 --> 43:55.220
because they're not getting it,

43:55.220 --> 43:57.540
not at all as far as I can see.

43:57.540 --> 43:59.140
I think the resurrection, as you say,

43:59.140 --> 44:01.500
is hugely important for Christians.

44:01.500 --> 44:03.180
And that's a miracle.

44:03.180 --> 44:08.180
And again, David Hume said that in ancient times,

44:08.340 --> 44:10.860
and in the past, people would believe the miracles

44:10.860 --> 44:14.020
because they didn't have a good understanding.

44:14.020 --> 44:16.860
They didn't understand natural laws,

44:16.860 --> 44:19.980
which is, I'm not sure if you agree with that,

44:19.980 --> 44:24.980
but he also said that miracles are a violation

44:25.020 --> 44:26.940
of natural law.

44:26.940 --> 44:29.380
So what is your take on that?

44:29.380 --> 44:34.220
And also, what evidence is there

44:34.220 --> 44:37.580
for the miracles and the resurrection?

44:37.580 --> 44:40.140
Well, my ancestry is Scottish,

44:40.140 --> 44:44.340
so far from me to criticize a Scotsman like David Hume,

44:44.340 --> 44:46.100
but he was wrong.

44:46.100 --> 44:51.100
And I say that not because I'm a Hume expert,

44:51.860 --> 44:54.820
but the most famous Hume expert that I ever met

44:54.820 --> 44:57.540
was Anthony Flu, the philosopher,

44:57.540 --> 45:00.740
who all his life, championed atheism,

45:00.740 --> 45:02.140
like Richard Dawkins did,

45:02.140 --> 45:07.140
until he came to see that the cell and human DNA

45:08.860 --> 45:12.860
was a code and it spoke of intelligence.

45:12.860 --> 45:15.220
And I had an interview with him,

45:15.220 --> 45:17.220
not long before he died, and I asked him,

45:17.220 --> 45:19.780
I said, what about David Hume and miracles?

45:19.780 --> 45:20.980
He said, I was wrong,

45:20.980 --> 45:23.140
and he made one of the most humble statements

45:23.140 --> 45:25.740
I've ever heard from an academic.

45:25.740 --> 45:28.420
He said, my books were wrong,

45:28.420 --> 45:29.780
I'd have to rewrite them,

45:29.780 --> 45:31.740
and I'm never going to have the chance.

45:31.740 --> 45:33.460
But let's come to the substance of it,

45:33.460 --> 45:35.460
that's just a little story.

45:35.460 --> 45:38.140
Miracles violations of the laws of nature,

45:38.140 --> 45:41.100
that's where the confusion lies.

45:41.100 --> 45:46.100
Law has two meanings for most of us.

45:46.220 --> 45:49.260
They're the laws of nature, what are they?

45:49.260 --> 45:52.740
They are our descriptions of the mathematics,

45:52.740 --> 45:55.240
of what normally happens.

45:55.240 --> 45:59.700
The apple dropped, falls towards the center of the earth,

45:59.700 --> 46:01.460
as Newton pointed out.

46:01.460 --> 46:06.340
The planets revolve around the sun in elliptical axes.

46:06.340 --> 46:08.500
But then there are those that say,

46:08.500 --> 46:12.060
you must not drive in inner London

46:12.060 --> 46:15.340
without paying a congestion charge.

46:15.340 --> 46:18.700
And if you don't pay it, you're going to get clobbered.

46:18.700 --> 46:20.420
That's a different kind of law.

46:20.420 --> 46:22.140
They get totally confused.

46:22.140 --> 46:25.620
Now Lewis, as usual, in his wonderful genius,

46:25.620 --> 46:28.020
he went right to the heart of this,

46:28.020 --> 46:29.700
in a most brilliant book,

46:29.700 --> 46:31.580
which most people don't read

46:31.580 --> 46:33.940
because they get stuck in the third or fourth chapter,

46:33.940 --> 46:35.340
which is quite difficult.

46:35.340 --> 46:38.140
They should leave it out and go to the next chapter.

46:38.140 --> 46:40.740
But Lewis tells this illustration.

46:40.740 --> 46:43.940
Here I am, I stay in London overnight,

46:43.940 --> 46:47.420
and I put 50 pounds in the drawer, night one.

46:47.420 --> 46:51.660
Night two, I put another 50 in, so that's 100 pounds.

46:52.740 --> 46:55.740
I'm leaving on day three, I get up in the morning,

46:55.740 --> 46:59.460
and I find a 10-pound note in the drawer.

46:59.460 --> 47:01.220
So what do I conclude?

47:01.220 --> 47:03.220
That the laws of arithmetic have been broken

47:03.220 --> 47:04.460
or the laws of England?

47:04.980 --> 47:08.500
Well, you're nothing, because you see,

47:08.500 --> 47:11.340
I conclude the laws of England have been broken.

47:11.340 --> 47:12.820
How do I know that?

47:12.820 --> 47:15.860
Because the laws of arithmetic have not been broken.

47:17.340 --> 47:18.180
You see?

47:19.300 --> 47:22.300
It's the fact that the laws of arithmetic hold

47:22.300 --> 47:25.940
that tell me that somebody's put their hand in

47:27.140 --> 47:30.940
to what I thought was a closed system of cause and effect,

47:30.940 --> 47:32.540
but it turned out not to be,

47:32.540 --> 47:35.140
so a thief could put their hand in.

47:35.140 --> 47:37.980
So that has helped me enormously,

47:37.980 --> 47:42.140
because it really knocks you right out of the ballpark.

47:43.140 --> 47:46.660
It shows that the confusion lies in the nature

47:46.660 --> 47:49.140
of our concept of law.

47:49.140 --> 47:52.140
The laws of nature are not like the laws of England.

47:52.140 --> 47:55.340
Now here's the slightly ironic thing.

47:55.340 --> 47:57.300
In order to recognize a miracle,

47:57.300 --> 47:59.460
and the word miracle is slightly unfortunate,

47:59.460 --> 48:02.540
because it's Latin, miraculum is a wonder.

48:02.540 --> 48:06.060
What we're talking about is supernatural events

48:06.060 --> 48:09.340
that give evidence that there is a supernatural.

48:09.340 --> 48:12.660
Not everything that claims to be a miracle is one.

48:12.660 --> 48:16.380
If I say it's a miracle that Jim passed his exam,

48:16.380 --> 48:18.980
that isn't necessarily supernatural.

48:18.980 --> 48:20.740
It's because he was a silly nitwit

48:20.740 --> 48:22.380
and didn't do any work.

48:22.380 --> 48:23.220
You see?

48:23.220 --> 48:25.700
So we need to focus,

48:25.700 --> 48:28.100
and that's why I focus on the resurrection.

48:28.100 --> 48:31.660
This is the central claim that Jesus rose.

48:31.660 --> 48:33.060
It's supernatural.

48:33.060 --> 48:35.300
It's not simply that Jesus rose

48:35.300 --> 48:37.460
as if it came from inside the grave.

48:37.460 --> 48:40.060
It's God raised him from the dead.

48:41.580 --> 48:44.500
It's power coming in from outside.

48:44.500 --> 48:46.180
Now take a simple analogy.

48:46.180 --> 48:48.860
If I pick this up and drop it,

48:48.860 --> 48:50.900
the law of gravitation will tell me

48:50.900 --> 48:52.900
it falls towards the center of the earth.

48:52.900 --> 48:55.780
That will not stop Samuel catching it.

48:55.780 --> 48:58.060
He can intervene and stop it.

48:58.100 --> 49:00.340
And it doesn't break the law of gravity.

49:00.340 --> 49:05.020
It changes the configuration of the situation.

49:05.020 --> 49:08.180
So at the larger level,

49:08.180 --> 49:13.100
God created a universe with regularities in it.

49:13.100 --> 49:15.380
If he hadn't done it that way,

49:15.380 --> 49:19.300
you wouldn't have been able to recognize a miracle

49:19.300 --> 49:20.740
if you saw one.

49:20.740 --> 49:25.060
If we didn't know the dead bodies normally remain dead,

49:25.060 --> 49:28.140
we wouldn't be the least bit surprised by resurrection.

49:28.140 --> 49:29.780
And the interesting thing is,

49:29.780 --> 49:32.220
it answers another thing of Hume's.

49:32.220 --> 49:36.020
Hume said, and you put it in your introduction

49:36.020 --> 49:37.900
to the question that in those days,

49:37.900 --> 49:41.980
people didn't know the laws of nature, didn't they?

49:41.980 --> 49:44.540
When Joseph was told by his fiance

49:44.540 --> 49:46.380
that she was pregnant,

49:46.380 --> 49:48.580
he didn't know where babies came from, did he?

49:48.580 --> 49:49.620
So he believed her.

49:49.620 --> 49:51.860
No, he didn't, because he knew exactly

49:51.860 --> 49:53.420
where they came from.

49:53.420 --> 49:56.940
And we read that because he was a righteous man,

49:56.940 --> 49:58.660
he wanted to divorce her quietly.

49:58.660 --> 50:01.260
He didn't want to expose her to public

50:01.260 --> 50:04.420
because he knew exactly what the law of nature was.

50:04.420 --> 50:07.820
And it took a special intervention of God

50:07.820 --> 50:09.940
speaking to that man and saying,

50:09.940 --> 50:12.100
Joseph, this is okay.

50:12.100 --> 50:14.060
This is holy.

50:14.060 --> 50:15.980
I'm behind this.

50:15.980 --> 50:18.260
The man born blind in John 9,

50:18.260 --> 50:19.460
it's a wonderful story.

50:19.460 --> 50:21.540
It's actually a humorous story.

50:21.540 --> 50:23.500
They said to him, well,

50:23.500 --> 50:24.940
you weren't the man who was blind

50:24.940 --> 50:26.500
or you weren't born blind, all this.

50:26.500 --> 50:29.020
And he said, look, let's cut all this out.

50:29.020 --> 50:30.500
Since the beginning of the world,

50:30.500 --> 50:32.980
it's never been heard that someone born blind

50:32.980 --> 50:34.500
has received their sight.

50:34.500 --> 50:36.780
So what has happened to me is unique.

50:36.780 --> 50:38.580
It must be supernatural.

50:38.580 --> 50:41.020
Of course they knew the laws of nature.

50:41.020 --> 50:44.340
And therefore, Hume was wrong on both those counts.

50:44.340 --> 50:48.860
So John, I want to come to the issue of the wording

50:48.860 --> 50:50.380
and the definition of apologetics

50:50.380 --> 50:53.220
because that's exactly what apologetics does,

50:53.220 --> 50:55.140
just what you did just now,

50:55.140 --> 50:59.540
explaining miracles and explaining the rationality of faith.

50:59.540 --> 51:03.700
But apologetics has nothing to do with being apologetic.

51:03.700 --> 51:05.740
It comes from the Greek word apologia,

51:05.740 --> 51:08.660
which means giving a defense of something.

51:08.660 --> 51:09.500
But at the same time,

51:09.500 --> 51:12.900
the second point I want to make, John, is this.

51:12.900 --> 51:16.540
Apologetics seems to explain things,

51:16.540 --> 51:19.620
but does that limit Christianity

51:19.620 --> 51:24.220
to only the things that we can demonstrate

51:24.220 --> 51:26.780
and explain apologetically?

51:26.780 --> 51:28.700
So what is apologetics

51:28.700 --> 51:31.380
and what are the limits of apologetics?

51:31.380 --> 51:34.860
Well, as you say, apologia is defense.

51:34.860 --> 51:37.180
But it's interesting if you do a word search

51:37.180 --> 51:39.620
to see where it's used in the New Testament,

51:39.620 --> 51:44.620
and it's mostly used by or about Paul.

51:44.860 --> 51:48.380
And his number one apologia defense is,

51:48.380 --> 51:50.740
I was on the Damascus Road

51:50.740 --> 51:54.380
and I met the risen Christ and he completely changed my life.

51:54.380 --> 51:56.820
That was his main apologetic.

51:56.820 --> 51:58.300
And that's why I don't like the word

51:58.300 --> 52:00.100
because it sounds like an apology.

52:00.100 --> 52:01.900
We should have translated it.

52:01.900 --> 52:03.820
All we did was take it straight out of Greek

52:03.820 --> 52:05.700
and transliterated it.

52:05.700 --> 52:06.780
But it's much better.

52:06.780 --> 52:10.500
I think Peter May's explanation of it is the best.

52:10.500 --> 52:12.740
It's persuasive evangelism.

52:12.740 --> 52:15.660
And the most persuasive thing about your experience

52:15.660 --> 52:17.300
if you're a Christian here tonight

52:17.300 --> 52:19.300
is your experience of Christ.

52:19.300 --> 52:23.980
So it's not just a question of reasoning.

52:23.980 --> 52:27.660
Although reason is involved at every level.

52:27.660 --> 52:29.380
Of course it is.

52:29.380 --> 52:34.380
Reason and faith are not an opposition.

52:35.420 --> 52:37.860
You need reason even to read the Bible.

52:37.860 --> 52:40.140
People get very confused about it.

52:40.140 --> 52:43.420
And one of the reasons for that confusion is

52:43.420 --> 52:46.460
they think that they called me an apologist.

52:46.460 --> 52:47.300
I don't like that.

52:47.300 --> 52:51.220
I try to persuade people and I use argument.

52:51.220 --> 52:54.980
But the key to the effectiveness of that

52:54.980 --> 52:59.260
is that when Paul stood up and reasoned in Athens

52:59.260 --> 53:00.580
and reasoned everywhere else

53:00.580 --> 53:03.380
and the Lord did it all the time,

53:03.380 --> 53:07.980
Paul was using his abilities but he wasn't trusting them.

53:07.980 --> 53:12.860
And the danger for Christians often with a high education

53:12.860 --> 53:15.740
is that they start to trust their reason

53:15.740 --> 53:18.660
and they use God when they get stuck.

53:18.660 --> 53:21.820
Real Christianity is to use our reason

53:21.820 --> 53:25.820
and all the abilities he's given us but to trust him.

53:25.820 --> 53:28.060
That's the key it seems to me.

53:28.060 --> 53:30.180
And that solves a lot of difficulties

53:30.180 --> 53:34.900
and we must beware that the arguments are all important

53:34.900 --> 53:38.080
but we trust God.

53:38.080 --> 53:41.780
And if we're trusting God we'll know

53:41.820 --> 53:44.900
how to move and detect whether questions

53:44.900 --> 53:47.220
are genuine or not, many are.

53:47.220 --> 53:49.740
Many people simply need the stones out of the way

53:49.740 --> 53:52.220
so that they can see clearly what the gospel is.

53:52.220 --> 53:56.220
But in the end, God is not a proposition.

53:56.220 --> 53:57.660
He's a person.

53:57.660 --> 54:01.140
Christ is not a set of propositions.

54:01.140 --> 54:05.700
He's a person so that what is being offered to us

54:05.700 --> 54:08.540
is a relationship of trust with a person.

54:08.540 --> 54:10.460
That's a huge thing.

54:10.460 --> 54:13.660
A relationship with the one who created the universe.

54:13.660 --> 54:16.900
And that for me is the biggest thing.

54:16.900 --> 54:19.540
And in this world where it's being attacked

54:19.540 --> 54:22.460
left, right and center, we need to know

54:22.460 --> 54:26.460
not simply what we believe but why we believe it

54:26.460 --> 54:29.220
because you cannot open your mouth

54:29.220 --> 54:31.820
in a multicultural, pluralistic society

54:31.820 --> 54:35.860
like what we've got here without people misunderstanding,

54:35.860 --> 54:39.340
misrepresenting or simply just being curious

54:39.380 --> 54:41.700
and we've got to answer.

54:41.700 --> 54:46.540
Always, said Peter, be ready to give an answer to people

54:46.540 --> 54:51.540
and a pologia to people who demand a reason

54:52.220 --> 54:54.620
for the hope that is within you.

54:54.620 --> 54:57.700
But do it with meekness.

54:59.040 --> 55:01.420
Justin Briley wrote a brilliant book

55:01.420 --> 55:05.020
called The Surprising Rebirth of Belief in God.

55:05.020 --> 55:09.100
And his main argument is that the new atheism

55:09.100 --> 55:12.780
wave is actually gone now and it's failed.

55:12.780 --> 55:15.740
And there's a lot of evidence to support that actually.

55:15.740 --> 55:19.340
And there's a new conversation coming on

55:19.340 --> 55:21.780
with new questions being asked

55:21.780 --> 55:24.020
that weren't asked 20 years ago.

55:24.020 --> 55:26.380
For example, what is the meaning of life?

55:26.380 --> 55:30.020
What is my identity and so on.

55:30.020 --> 55:35.020
Now, at the same time, we all know that Christianity,

55:35.020 --> 55:38.380
according to the last census, is going down

55:38.380 --> 55:40.500
and is not what it used to be.

55:40.500 --> 55:44.260
So it's declining in the Western societies,

55:44.260 --> 55:47.140
at least in Western Europe.

55:47.140 --> 55:49.820
But how do you reconcile the two views?

55:49.820 --> 55:53.460
And do you think there's a new wave of intellectuals,

55:53.460 --> 55:56.660
perhaps as Justin mentioned, people like Jordan Peterson,

55:56.660 --> 55:59.420
it was great to see you on his podcast,

55:59.420 --> 56:02.060
people like Louise Perry, Tom Holland and others

56:02.060 --> 56:07.060
who not only agree that Europe was based on Christianity

56:07.780 --> 56:10.980
and the foundation of Europe is Christian,

56:10.980 --> 56:13.740
but they also acknowledge and appreciate

56:13.740 --> 56:15.860
the social value of Christianity.

56:15.860 --> 56:17.740
How do you reconcile these two views?

56:18.940 --> 56:23.100
Well, first of all, I support your view of Justin's book

56:23.100 --> 56:27.700
and spare his blushes, but I would encourage you to read.

56:27.700 --> 56:31.980
This man has probably one of the most comprehensive

56:31.980 --> 56:34.420
experiences of entering the arena

56:34.460 --> 56:37.180
and getting both sides together to debate these things.

56:37.180 --> 56:40.540
And it is very worthwhile reading.

56:40.540 --> 56:43.860
And if you get anything tonight, get that book.

56:43.860 --> 56:45.180
That's number one.

56:45.180 --> 56:50.180
Number two, I think, is that I think he's right

56:50.580 --> 56:53.140
that the new atheism is waning

56:53.140 --> 56:58.140
and it's a belligerent kind of atheism that has dropped.

56:58.220 --> 57:00.860
There's another kind of vicious atheism

57:00.860 --> 57:02.900
that is keeping preville imprisoned

57:03.020 --> 57:05.940
in Xinjiang and China and all of that.

57:05.940 --> 57:07.980
We'll not go into that tonight,

57:07.980 --> 57:12.980
but it has changed and questions of meaning and identity

57:13.860 --> 57:17.580
are coming up to the fore in the population

57:17.580 --> 57:21.380
and young people, people want some kind of identity.

57:21.380 --> 57:23.780
That's a pressure coming in one direction.

57:23.780 --> 57:26.300
Then there are transhumanists in the other direction

57:26.300 --> 57:30.220
saying we're going to give you an enhanced identity,

57:30.260 --> 57:34.180
but it's going to involve bioengineering.

57:34.180 --> 57:36.700
It's going to involve you giving up a lot of things

57:36.700 --> 57:39.660
and we need to listen to C.S. Lewis in this.

57:39.660 --> 57:43.460
I would recommend to everybody to read a book

57:43.460 --> 57:46.340
that you mentioned earlier on, The Abolition of Man.

57:46.340 --> 57:49.340
It's a short book, but it's prescient.

57:49.340 --> 57:54.220
And Lewis saw in that book and in his science fiction novel,

57:54.220 --> 57:58.860
that hideous strength, that if a group of scientists

57:58.860 --> 58:03.860
get the capacity to modify human identity,

58:03.860 --> 58:08.220
for example, by messing around with the human genome

58:09.940 --> 58:14.780
and creating a heritable sequence

58:14.780 --> 58:19.260
where the specification of human beings will change forever.

58:19.260 --> 58:22.900
What they will produce are not human beings

58:22.900 --> 58:25.340
in the image of God, but artifacts.

58:25.340 --> 58:27.580
And he has got this chilling statement.

58:27.580 --> 58:30.780
He says, the final triumph will be

58:30.780 --> 58:33.780
of man will be the abolition of man.

58:33.780 --> 58:37.260
They won't be humans, they'll be beings of some kind.

58:37.260 --> 58:39.940
And I fear we're moving rapidly towards that

58:39.940 --> 58:43.820
because in my research of artificial intelligence,

58:43.820 --> 58:47.700
there's a disproportionate number of people driving it

58:47.700 --> 58:51.740
who are very strongly convinced of the atheist worldview.

58:51.740 --> 58:56.460
It's not worldview neutral, so we need to take that on board.

58:56.460 --> 58:59.780
And it's wonderful that we have particularly young people

58:59.780 --> 59:03.420
around who are communicating the gospel in a way

59:03.420 --> 59:04.980
that's got street credibility

59:04.980 --> 59:07.060
because it's bringing young people meaning.

59:07.060 --> 59:09.260
And we need to encourage people like that

59:09.260 --> 59:13.020
and develop their ability and give them a platform.

59:13.020 --> 59:16.420
But there are, as you say, some very interesting people

59:16.420 --> 59:19.900
around Jordan Peterson, but whom I interacted recently

59:19.900 --> 59:24.180
and it's on YouTube, is one of them

59:24.180 --> 59:27.780
who's moving incrementally, but moving clearly

59:27.780 --> 59:32.620
and on his own confession towards the Christian faith.

59:32.620 --> 59:35.700
Tom Holland, with whom I've interacted personally.

59:35.700 --> 59:39.980
Fascinating, brought up as an ancient historian

59:39.980 --> 59:42.060
and his book Dominion is Brilliant.

59:42.060 --> 59:45.340
But what it's devoted to is his change.

59:45.340 --> 59:47.900
He thought originally that all the good things

59:47.900 --> 59:51.100
in our society came from the Greeks and the Romans.

59:51.100 --> 59:53.700
He then discovered they came actually

59:53.700 --> 59:56.260
from the biblical worldview.

59:56.260 --> 01:00:01.940
And he has got a wonderfully powerful statement

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:04.940
about the effect of the cross.

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:08.220
It is quite remarkable to read, and that's another book.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.300
We're recommending lots of books tonight.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:11.940
Dominion Worth Reading.

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.740
And there are a number of people, it seems,

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.260
to be around the world who, intellectuals,

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:20.620
public intellectuals, who seem to be moving step by step

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:24.580
towards a full confession of the Christian faith.

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.260
And there's then an outer group of people,

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:30.060
and I keep meeting them who, although they're not

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:33.540
that far yet, they are convinced that the materialism

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:37.860
that dominates the academy and elsewhere is not enough.

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:41.900
And they say to me, John, there must be something more.

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.700
Well, that's a great start to realize

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.420
there must be something more.

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:48.140
That's a very good point because this new conversation

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.500
opens the door to all things spiritual.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:54.980
And there's a new generation that's seeking meaning

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:58.300
and looking beyond this world and seeking

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:01.580
some spiritual meaning, even though that may not

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.660
be Christianity.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:07.300
Now, as we close, John, there are many, many young people

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.500
in this audience who still have doubts

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.580
and feel there might be a tension between science

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:14.820
and faith in God.

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:18.420
What advice would you give to young people

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:20.900
in the audience who may feel this tension?

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.460
Don't duck the questions if they come up in your mind.

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:27.220
That's the first thing.

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:31.220
Because one of the reasons I'm sitting here as a believer,

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:36.220
80 years old and a scientist, is that I've discovered

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:37.380
in life there are answers.

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.820
Sometimes you have to wait a bit, you have to do some work.

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:44.660
But that's important, that the questions that bother you

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:49.220
start to do a bit of reading, talk to other people,

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:52.940
openly about your questions and your doubts.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:56.460
Because a large part of my Christian conviction

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:59.460
has come from asking hard questions

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.940
and waiting till I got answers.

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.580
Now, I don't know whether I'm allowed to do

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.540
a little bit of advertising,

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:09.380
but I've been so concerned by this young people

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.980
feeling this tension that this book,

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:14.340
I was told this book, God's Undertaker,

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.660
people found too difficult to read.

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:20.620
So, I've done a much shorter one called

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:23.020
Can Science Explain Everything?

01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:26.540
And some people are kind enough to say it has helped them,

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:28.900
not only young people, but older people,

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:33.460
to get some resolution to this tension.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:36.380
And I think the main resolution will come

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:39.740
in the answer to the question that I did earlier,

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:42.780
that the God explanation and the science explanation

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:45.540
are different kinds of explanation.

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:49.740
So, read and discuss this kind of thing,

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:53.220
because there are answers that can ease you

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.660
through that tension.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:59.660
You see, just think of a simple historical fact.

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:04.660
Virtually all the great pioneers of modern science,

01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:08.900
starting with Galileo, Kepler, Newton,

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.220
coming up through Faraday Clock Maxwell,

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.300
they were all believers in God.

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:16.540
And historians have noticed this,

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:19.780
and C.S. Lewis put it beautifully as usual.

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:22.540
And he summed it up this way.

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.900
He said, men became scientific

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:27.580
because they expected law in nature,

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.100
and they expected law in nature

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:31.980
because they believed in the legislator.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:34.660
I'm not ashamed of being a scientist and a Christian,

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:39.660
because arguably, it was Christianity gave me my subject.

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.300
You see, science, biology was started

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.900
on page two of the Bible.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.820
Many people don't realize that.

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:49.380
God named bits of the universe,

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:52.020
but then he told the first humans,

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.020
you go and name the animals.

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:56.980
Taxonomy, naming things is the fundamental

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.420
scientific discipline.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:00.260
God said, you go and do it yourself.

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.940
And we've been doing it ever since.

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.740
So, I think we've got a real mandate to do science,

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.540
and to do it with God, not against God.

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.260
John, there's a lot of wisdom in your thoughts.

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:11.900
Thank you very much for your insights on science

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:15.700
and faith in God, on evolution and creation,

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:19.340
on the miracles, and it's great to have you with us.

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.340
Thank you very much for your thoughts.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.900
Ladies and gentlemen, John Lennox.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:33.240
Let's kick off with a few of these very popular questions.

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:37.100
So, you've spoken at length about science and faith

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.420
this evening.

01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:40.300
But one of the most popular questions here is,

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.780
do you think there could be other forms of life

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:43.620
in the universe?

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:44.940
And I suppose I would like to ask,

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:46.900
and if there were, would it matter?

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.020
I was asked, I was at a launch of a book

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:55.420
by Professor Paul Davis, a physicist,

01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:58.260
and his book is called, Are We Alone?

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.900
And I was interviewed, and I was being interviewed

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:06.460
by a certain station called Premier Christian Radio.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:07.300
I don't know whether you remember.

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:08.940
I remember the interview well.

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:11.580
It was one of the first times I'd had you on the show,

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.260
and I brought you on with Paul Davis.

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.340
That's right.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.620
And Paul Davis said, as a scientist,

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:20.220
he thought that we weren't alone, we were alone,

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:22.940
but as a person, he hoped we weren't alone.

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:26.900
And then I was asked, did I believe

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:29.500
that there were other intelligence in the universe?

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.580
And I said, yes, and one very big one called God.

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:37.340
And quite seriously, from a Christian perspective,

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:40.660
there are other intelligences in the universe.

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:41.860
Of course there are.

01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:45.700
And God is the greatest one, but there are others,

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.500
because we are told that there are beings,

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:53.500
in some sense, above us, the Bible calls them spirit beings.

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:58.420
They're not made of matters, we understand it,

01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.300
angels and so on.

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:01.740
So there are others.

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:06.740
This whole universe is much more complex than we think.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:11.980
And our vision, we don't see everything.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.380
So I think there are, and it does matter infinitely,

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:20.260
because if we were the only intelligences around,

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:24.060
we'd be left with the question as to where we come from.

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.540
But because we know about God,

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:29.940
then we've got a huge answer to that question.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:32.140
Thank you so much.

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:35.060
From the sublime to the almost ridiculous,

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:38.500
in this question, there are lots of theories

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.900
in our internet age floating around.

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:43.340
And interestingly, one of the ones

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:45.860
that has sort of had a bizarre revival,

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:48.260
is the idea that we're living on a flat earth.

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:51.700
And this has been, this is the most popular question,

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.020
according to the likes.

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:56.180
What do you think about the flat earth debate, John?

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.460
Nothing at all, really.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:00.580
I mean, but in all seriousness, there's, for me,

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:03.580
it's a sign of the fact we live in an age

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:06.380
where almost anything can get airtight on these days.

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:07.220
And that's true.

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:11.420
It wasn't a cheek, I should say, that if people reject God,

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:13.380
they don't believe in nothing.

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:15.300
They end up believing in anything.

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:19.180
And it just shows there's masses of ridiculous things

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:20.180
that people believe.

01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:22.260
And they don't believe in anything.

01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:26.140
And it just shows there's masses of ridiculous things

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.380
that people believe.

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:29.700
And that is the thing that staggers me,

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.420
taking the question seriously.

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:33.100
They will believe that kind of thing,

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:36.260
where for which the evidence is all contrary.

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:41.260
And yet, when it comes to seriously set forward

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.420
arguments and reasons for believing in God,

01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:46.000
they won't even listen to them.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.540
There's a double think, and I would go as far as to say

01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:52.500
that there's a reason for it.

01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:56.980
There's a very interesting statement that Paul made,

01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:00.220
that the God of this world has blinded the minds

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:02.500
of those who don't believe.

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:07.500
That there is an enemy who sets the thought forms

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:08.700
of the world.

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:14.140
And Paul analyzes the intellectual darkness

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:16.780
that comes about in Romans.

01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:20.980
When people reject God, they end up worshiping stones

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.700
and inanimate things.

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:26.260
They ascribe creatorial power to nature

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:28.340
because they don't believe in God.

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:31.780
And some of it is utterly absurd.

01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:33.300
And yet, that is what happens.

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:36.300
And I would describe it as intellectual darkness,

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.020
but there's an enemy behind it.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:40.820
Thank you.

01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:42.300
This is a very popular question.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.820
What do you think, why do you think Christianity

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:49.020
is on the decline in Europe, especially amongst young people?

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:53.860
That's very complex, I think, historically.

01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:57.340
You're probably better positioned to answer that than I am.

01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:01.740
There are roots in history going back to the enlightenment

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:06.740
of the evils perpetuated by some professing branches

01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:09.940
of the Christian church have died hard.

01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:14.180
The fact that in the whole EU constitution,

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.020
the word God has not mentioned at all,

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:19.860
the fact that our major institutions

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:23.640
are all of them virtually as Tom Holland

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.340
and Jordan Peters and other people are pointing out

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:28.340
are all traceable back to scripture,

01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.860
yet that's airbrushed out of history

01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:34.580
so that we are educating young people.

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:37.020
We're, in that sense, brainwashing them

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:39.100
and not telling them the facts

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:42.140
so that they just don't know.

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:46.500
And it's not surprising.

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.900
You see, let me put it very crudely.

01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:51.780
If you tell people constantly, young people,

01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:54.140
that there's no meaning in life,

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:58.380
they are simply animals, moderately sophisticated animals,

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:00.860
they'll end up believing you.

01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:03.900
And therefore, their behavior will not be governed

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.140
by any sense of morality.

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:09.240
And it is frightening to read things like this.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.500
A class of students ask this,

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.660
give an example of a moral dilemma.

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:18.580
Answer, what is a moral dilemma?

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:23.220
We are in serious trouble, folks,

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.460
but I'm glad you said in Europe

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.080
because there are other parts of the world

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:30.180
where Christianity is growing and thriving

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.860
and they are often the parts

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:35.460
where there's been much more persecution.

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:37.980
And then somebody pointed out to me the other day,

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:39.980
if you take the whole of the Bible,

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.420
how much of it was written at a time

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:45.820
and there was no persecution and trouble, very little.

01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:48.940
And we have had an experience in Europe,

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:51.220
at least until relatively recently,

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:55.260
without war for an unusual period of time.

01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:58.060
And unfortunately, into the vacuum,

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:02.940
there has poured all this kind of stuff,

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:05.660
post-modernism, atheism, all the rest of it.

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:08.180
And it has had an effect in our society.

01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:12.380
But please feel free to add to that, Justin,

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.100
because from your perspective...

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.700
I wouldn't disagree with anything

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:17.220
that you've said there, John.

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:20.500
I think that we are living in the wake,

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.540
if you like, of many different forces

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:25.500
that have led to the way in which religion

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:29.100
is now seen as a private hobby, almost.

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:32.380
And to that extent, it's part of the fact

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:35.300
that our cultures are increasingly mobile, fluid.

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:37.500
Many community institutions have broken down

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.900
because of the focus on individualism in our culture.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:42.220
And so I think there's a lot of things.

01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:44.740
And alongside that goes, obviously,

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:47.620
that this materialism, this story of materialism

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:50.780
that obviously convinces people without good foundation,

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:52.700
that there is no God and so on.

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:54.260
I think I'm encouraged,

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:56.460
and part of the story I tell in my new book

01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:58.900
is that actually people can only live on

01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:02.500
those thin versions of reality for so long, though,

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:04.820
until actually people do start to come back and ask,

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:07.180
is this the way life is meant to be lived?

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:09.380
And I'm encouraged, actually,

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:14.100
that I see a lot of young people almost,

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:16.660
as we reach a point where

01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:19.780
there's almost no familiarity with the Christian story.

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:21.500
One of the good things about that

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.860
is that you don't have the assumption

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:25.340
that you know what it is.

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.660
And sometimes it's actually easier

01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:29.260
to start telling people what it is

01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:30.420
when they don't know anything about it,

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:32.380
rather than those who think they know what it is,

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:35.380
but actually have a rather false idea of it in their head.

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:38.060
So I think we should be encouraged.

01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:40.700
I mean, let me skip to this question

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:42.900
since we're talking about this.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:45.500
And this is obviously a lot of people here

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.860
from the Romanian diaspora.

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.420
And someone asked, what is your advice

01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.900
for the Romanian community specifically,

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.580
the Christian Romanian community,

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:56.780
for improving the belief climate in the UK?

01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:58.340
Any thoughts on that, John?

01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:04.020
Well, I have had the privilege of being in Romania

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.540
several times.

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:08.580
The first time I went, I was poisoned deliberately

01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:09.980
by the secret police.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:12.140
Wow.

01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:13.500
It nearly killed me.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.460
Gosh.

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:17.580
And I look back to that and the Lord preserved me

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.620
because I went to visit some marvelous Christians there,

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:21.820
but I've been back since

01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:23.980
and they don't feed you poison anymore.

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:27.900
And they don't have the poison.

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:31.180
I think I could say,

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:34.580
but you need to ask Samuel about that.

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:37.620
They haven't been infected by all the poisons

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:40.660
of atheism that we have in the West.

01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:43.220
So I think you've got,

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.740
and what I saw in my brief visits,

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:49.780
you've got much more sense of togetherness as Christians.

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:51.020
Well, let's ask a Romanian.

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:53.460
Yes, I think Samuel needs to speak to this.

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:55.260
You'd probably be very well positioned

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:59.620
to this question of how the Romanian Christian community

01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:03.660
can specifically encourage belief in the West.

01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:06.140
Well, I think the Romanian diaspora community

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:09.500
is very strong here in London and in the UK.

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.380
There are many evangelical churches in London.

01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:13.780
And I think one of the reasons

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:18.580
that Romanians believe in God and keep their faith,

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:22.260
although they live in a very secularized society

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:24.900
and culture is because of communism.

01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:29.900
And communism promoted atheism as the national ideology.

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:34.180
And Romanians have lived this for several decades

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.300
and experienced what that means.

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.300
And it simply doesn't work.

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:41.300
So that's one of the reasons that Romanians

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.260
and Eastern Europe in general

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:45.700
remained a very religious society.

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.060
It still is.

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:49.140
And I think Romanians

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:51.420
and other international diaspora communities,

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:55.020
such as the Polish diaspora community, for example,

01:14:55.020 --> 01:15:00.020
can and may indeed revive Christianity

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:05.540
and bring a new energy in terms of living faith

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:08.380
in a secular culture as the UK.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.860
I think that's absolutely true.

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:14.460
And I spent many years,

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:18.820
I started going to Eastern Europe in 1976

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:22.980
and traveled many times, particularly to Hungary, Poland

01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.300
and above all, East Germany.

01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:29.100
And I came to the conclusion that many of our modern day

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:32.220
so-called new atheists or passainer

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:37.220
have not got a clue about what atheism does to a culture.

01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:41.860
And as Romanians, you know,

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:44.220
and because you know,

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:48.700
you can be a force for enormous good in our society.

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:51.260
When people start talking about these things,

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:52.860
you could just say, just wait a minute,

01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:54.460
let me tell you what it was like

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:57.660
to live under the Sicuritate and the secret police.

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:01.060
And I saw this again and again in East Germany,

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:03.420
which was almost Stalinist

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.340
and I went there many times.

01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:09.060
You've got a huge contribution to make.

01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:11.260
And I think Samuel's absolutely right.

01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:15.780
And I would encourage you to be a source

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:19.860
of pushback against this kind of thing.

01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:24.860
I remember once talking in Russia actually in Siberia

01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:27.820
to an academician about the difference

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:30.060
between the East and the West.

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:34.140
And he said, in the both parts of the world,

01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:38.380
you've got materialism, you've got the material, we haven't.

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:41.740
But it's the same philosophy.

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:44.140
And that's the tragedy,

01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:47.380
the stuff that you were taught under Marxism

01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:52.380
is very little distance below the surface

01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:56.580
of some of the leading intellectuals in the West today.

01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:00.140
It's the same materialism as a philosophy,

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:02.060
but it's mixed with the consumerism

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:03.940
that you didn't have in those days.

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:06.180
And because you know what it's like

01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:10.820
to be deprived of many things because of an ideology,

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:13.500
the Christian ideology or worldview

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.340
is much more precious to you

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:16.740
because of what it's done

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:19.860
until you've a huge contribution to make.

01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:21.940
Just before we go to a question from the floor,

01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:23.620
there's just one more that links really well

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:25.860
in with what you've just been talking about, John,

01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:27.340
which is Andrew, who asks,

01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:29.300
can you share with us a short story

01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:31.420
from your experience before 1990

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:35.140
behind the Iron Curtain that could help our faith?

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:37.460
Because this is a fascinating aspect of your life

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:40.260
that perhaps not that many people know that you moved

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:44.460
and worked among people in Soviet Russia and so on.

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:48.300
Yes, well, before 1990, I wasn't in Russia.

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:53.060
I went there first in 1989, 1990.

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:56.780
But let me go years before that to East Germany.

01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:00.700
And I'll tell you one story of a girl called Esther.

01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:03.020
And she was a very bright girl.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:05.980
She'd been top of her class in school.

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.340
And I happened to be there.

01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:09.500
I'm a German speaker.

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.660
That's why I could move easily in East Germany.

01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:17.020
And she came home from school weeping her heart out

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:18.660
while we were there.

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:21.660
And we said, Esther, what's wrong?

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:23.980
She said, the teacher has just told me,

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:25.860
I've got to leave school and go and work

01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:27.820
in a slipper factory.

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:32.820
Now, this girl had been top of her class in every year.

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:37.780
But at the age of 13, she was asked to take

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:42.780
an oath of public allegiance to the atheistic state.

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:48.140
And she said, I'm a Christian, I can't do that.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.300
And she was crying.

01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:51.100
And we were weeping with her.

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:54.180
But I said, Esther, what did you say to the teacher?

01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:56.220
I'll never forget her answer.

01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:59.780
She said, Uncle John, I said to the teacher,

01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:04.540
sir, one day you will stand before God

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:08.700
and you will answer for what you've done to me this day.

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:10.140
I never forgot that.

01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:14.480
It's steeled me to redouble my efforts

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.480
to fight this ideology for the rest of my life.

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:22.260
And that's what I've tried to do with God's help

01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:27.260
to fight what is driving the most extreme things

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:28.660
on the planet.

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:31.420
And one of them is the persecution of the Uighurs.

01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:36.420
But all this kind of stuff comes from not a rejection

01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:39.420
of God, but a hatred of God.

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:43.340
And just that one thing encapsulates it.

01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:44.460
Wonderful.

01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.460
Let's have a question here.

01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:49.500
Many wars are fought in the name of God.

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:52.820
If God really cares, why is he allowing these things

01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:53.980
to happen?

01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:56.860
In the next is even many lives are lost

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.660
in natural disasters, innocent lives.

01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:02.500
Where is God when all these things happen?

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:03.340
Well, thank you.

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:06.300
That's the hardest question you can ask.

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:11.300
It's the hardest question for anyone of any worldview,

01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:15.180
the problem of evil and suffering.

01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:19.660
And I would want really to be fair to your question

01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:22.780
to have an hour to talk about it at least

01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:25.500
because there are no simplistic answers to this.

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:28.720
But I'll try and say something briefly.

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:33.160
You referred very briefly and concisely to two problems.

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.880
There's a problem of moral evil,

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:39.080
the bad things people do to one another, wars,

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.800
as we see it horribly these days.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:45.120
Then there's a problem of what's called natural evil,

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.120
which is a bit of a misnomer.

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.280
And that is catastrophes, diseases,

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:54.760
cancers, tsunamis, earthquakes, all that kind of thing.

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:59.480
Now, how do we face that?

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.520
And I'm gonna cut to the middle of that

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:06.680
and tell you where I begin to see a possibility.

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:09.960
I've no simplistic answer because there isn't one.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.940
But there are two ways of looking at it.

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:19.400
The person who's suffering sees it in a very different way

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.800
from say me who's watching the suffering.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.320
In other words, cancer looks very different

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.120
in the eyes of a young mother who's just been told

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.200
she's got six months to live

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.400
and in the eyes of the oncologist who's treating her.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:37.080
So there are two different sides

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:39.320
and the person that's watching tends

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.240
to have a more intellectual response.

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:42.920
They're full of big questions.

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.600
The other person is in utter pain

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:49.480
and needs comfort and help and encouragement.

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.160
Now, how do we face it?

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:55.240
Well, I'll tell you how I begin to face it.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.840
The way you formulated the question is a very common one

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.960
and it's been there for centuries.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:06.160
If there's a good and all powerful God,

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:10.480
how is it that the world is like this?

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:14.240
Now, let me look at it from the theoretical perspective first

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.480
because I'm afraid I'm a theorist, above all.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:20.560
And if you want me to tell you about suffering,

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.640
just see me in the dentists.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:31.120
Seriously though, many people respond to this

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.600
and say, therefore there's no God.

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.120
And many of my friends do

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:38.080
and I've been in Auschwitz many times

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.560
and I've wept every time.

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:42.000
It breaks my heart to see what's going on

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.360
in a country that I love in Ukraine.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.040
Been there many times.

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.040
All those cities, I know them all.

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:52.280
So, how do we respond?

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.760
Well, there's no God.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.080
Now, people that take that view

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.160
think they've solved the problem.

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:00.040
They've got rid of God, that's true.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.400
But they've also got rid by definition of all hope.

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.960
The situation for them is totally hopeless

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:09.920
but actually they've got rid of the problem of evil.

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.280
Now, this is a more serious philosophical point.

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.320
So if you don't like philosophy, go to sleep

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.720
until you want to wake up.

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:19.640
The whole concept of evil,

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:25.280
I believe is directly related to the existence of God.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:28.280
Dostoevsky, the famous Russian novelist,

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.440
said once, yes,

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:34.440
he's not exist, everything is permitted.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:37.240
In other words, he didn't mean atheists can't behave.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:42.240
He meant there's no reason for believing in good and evil.

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:45.120
And Richard Dawkins says exactly that.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.640
He says, this universe is just what you'd expected to be.

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:52.160
If at bottom, there's no evil, no justice.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.960
DNA just isn't, we dance to its music.

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:58.960
That's atheism, removing moral concepts.

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:01.280
But that doesn't work because Dawkins

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:05.440
doesn't even work for him because he knows he's a moral being

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.120
and therefore he talks about the problem of evil.

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.320
So there are many reasons that atheism

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.160
doesn't work intellectually,

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.960
but that's not going to help a person who's suffering.

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:18.640
Come now to the other side very briefly.

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.480
When I was a student, we used to have long discussions.

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.680
Well, if God is all powerful and he's all good,

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:29.480
and we never solved the problem, never.

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:32.640
I've never heard a good answer to the solution.

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.480
Now, I'm a mathematician

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:37.160
and when mathematicians try for centuries

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.360
to solve a problem, they usually ask themselves,

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.840
are we asking the right question?

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:46.560
So let me reformulate the question.

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.440
What are we faced with?

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.480
A mixed picture.

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:54.920
I call it beauty and barbed wire.

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.600
Beauty and bombs.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.280
We look out at the starry night,

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:02.720
we see the Andromeda galaxy and it's absolutely magnificent

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.680
and then we turn on the television

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.840
and we watch what's happening in Ukraine.

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:11.040
Beauty and bombs.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.960
We all have to face that.

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:19.200
Now, how are we going to face that mixed picture?

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:24.960
There's beauty, that's a mystery, if everything's evil.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.360
How is it that we get like that?

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.760
And now I ask myself a question that's just as hard

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.600
and it's this.

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.440
We've all got to grant that it's a mixed picture.

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.280
Is there any evidence anywhere

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.720
that there's a God that we could trust with it?

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.760
That's an equally hard question.

01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:53.720
But I believe that question brings us further

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:58.240
and it takes us directly to the cross

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:03.840
because the claim is, and I often say to people,

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:07.440
please listen to what Christianity claims

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.840
before you reject it.

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:14.520
The claim is that the one on the cross is God himself,

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.840
God incarnate.

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.880
So what, if I may put it bluntly,

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.800
is God doing on a cross, suffering?

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:25.120
Well, it certainly means that he hasn't remained distant

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:30.120
from our human suffering but has become part of it.

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:34.120
That's the first thing, the heart of God revealed.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.800
Now of course, if that's where it ended,

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.040
we'd never have heard of Jesus.

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:43.400
The next bit is where the resurrection comes

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.480
into central role.

01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.560
I would have no hope.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.280
I wouldn't be sitting here trying to answer your question.

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:54.120
If I didn't believe that God had raised Jesus from the dead

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:58.040
and that's where the hope comes in.

01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:03.040
You see, atheism is a hopeless faith, literally, hopeless.

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:04.960
There's no hope.

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:07.200
Now where can we get hope?

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.800
What has the atheist got to say to the young mother

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.160
with cancer?

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:12.000
Nothing.

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.600
Have I got anything to say as a Christian?

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:19.200
I can't promise her that she'd be cured

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.760
although we know God has the power to do it.

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:24.960
But what I can bring to her is a message of hope

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.960
that she can have a personal relationship with Christ

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.240
that will transcend death and have something

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:36.760
therefore to leave her children with.

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:41.680
Now, I was in Christchurch, New Zealand,

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:47.880
the same week as the earthquake and I spoke about this.

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.400
And when I'd finished, a huge audience,

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.280
one of the biggest that they'd seen in the church

01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:58.920
for many years, there was a note left for me from a lady

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:01.520
and it just said, I lost my husband last week.

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:07.640
And she said, what you said is the first glimmer of hope

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:10.760
I've got, glimmer of hope.

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.360
And I believe scripture analyzes this very carefully.

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:18.560
I haven't time to go into it in detail, sir,

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:23.560
but in John 11, there is the story

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.240
of what happens when people suffer.

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.960
Lazarus died.

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:31.720
The sisters expected Jesus to be there and cure him.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:34.960
He wasn't there, Jesus let the man die

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:38.360
and it nearly brought them to doubt the love of God.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.360
And when he eventually came and Lazarus was dead,

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:46.440
the sister said, if you'd been here, he wouldn't have died.

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.240
And then he suddenly told Martha,

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.320
I am the resurrection and the life.

01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:56.080
Now that whole story, I believe, shows us how this problem

01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.440
on the one side can lead people to doubt the love of God,

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:03.480
but how Christ answers it by being the resurrection

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:04.320
on the life.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:07.880
My final point is, I've tried to put this together

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:10.600
briefly in a little book that circled the world.

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:14.960
It's called, Where is God in a Coronavirus World?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.360
But that'll have to do for that.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:19.320
Well, thank you so much.

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.520
With apologies to the many other people

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:24.960
who have wanted to ask a question in person,

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.560
because time is drawn to a close,

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.560
I'm just gonna finish with a final question from Slido, John.

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:33.000
And this is, well, I'm gonna give you two actually,

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.600
because I think they're substantially the same question,

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:38.000
both very popular.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.360
Someone asks, when Muslim people do what we do,

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:44.200
which is believing what they're taught by their parents

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:46.240
carrying on their faith,

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:49.320
what makes them wrong and thus right?

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.600
And to sum up that question, someone else asks,

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:55.120
how do you prove that Christianity is the true religion

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.480
and other religions are false?

01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.760
Thanks for that.

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:04.760
I'm glad to hear that question because it's important.

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:09.080
I never try to answer that question without saying this.

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:13.480
When we start to talk about the differences

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:17.400
between religions, there is huge danger

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:20.280
of looking down at other people.

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:26.320
Now, it is very important to go back to something

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:31.000
that Samuel said in our interview.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Every man, woman on the planet is a person of infinite worth

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.920
made in the image of God.

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:45.320
And often you'll find that in essence,

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:49.920
the differences between religions are not moral differences.

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.800
They are differences in what people believe

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:56.120
about how you relate to God.

01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:02.480
And you will find that many of our Muslim friends

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:07.480
and Hindu friends and others have a strong moral code.

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:09.320
Why is that?

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:11.440
From where I sit, it's because they're made

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:14.280
in the image of God, they're moral beings.

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:18.480
And scripture tells us clearly that pagans

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:22.760
can sometimes put professed believers in God to shame.

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:27.080
Abraham in particular, the father of faith

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:32.080
and a pagan Egyptian pharaoh had a higher moral standard

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:33.080
than he did.

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:37.320
Now, it's so important to say that

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:40.680
because the moment you start to critique,

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:45.680
people think you're better than they are morally or not.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.680
My atheist friends could put me to shame

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.760
and you know Christians have been caught out

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:54.700
in all kinds of things.

01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:58.800
So we need to be very careful that we first recognize

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:02.000
that the people we're talking about are made

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.160
in the image of God and therefore,

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:06.760
as creatures of God have infinite value.

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:11.720
Once we've said that, we can now come to the next question

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:13.600
because there's respect there.

01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:17.520
The second point is, well, let me take the three great

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:20.920
monotheistic religions or we'll be here all night.

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:23.280
Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:28.120
Now, you could leave Christianity out.

01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:32.280
Judaism and Islam are not going to agree

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:36.080
about, well, what is central to Christianity?

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:38.280
It might as well bring it in again.

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:42.600
Think of Jesus or Esa as Muslims call him.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:46.820
Yeshua, as the Jews call him.

01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:51.500
My Jewish friends believe that he died and didn't rise.

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:55.180
My Muslim friends believe he didn't die.

01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:58.920
I believe he died and rose.

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:02.640
Those three things cannot be simultaneously correct.

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:05.760
And when I find, I talk about this in public,

01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.880
my Jewish and Muslim friends are nodding.

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:09.160
They agree.

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:12.480
They just do not agree on what is central.

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.720
Now, how are you going to decide it?

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:17.760
Well, I know of no other way on a matter of evidence

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:19.640
and then we discuss that.

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:23.400
But there's another approach and that is this.

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:27.120
And this is, I think, the crux of the matter.

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:30.440
People often say to me, you know, you're a scientist

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.840
and you talk about evidence for God, the universe

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.280
and all that's marvelous, but you're a Christian.

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:39.640
How do you bridge the gap between belief in God

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:43.840
as the God of the universe and a specifically Christian

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:44.840
message?

01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:48.820
Well, I say, let's look at it this way.

01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:54.880
The heart of Christianity is rather different

01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:58.280
from what many people expect.

01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.800
And if I am to explain that, I often ask people,

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:04.680
I say, first of all, tell me what a religion is.

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:07.000
What do you think a religion is?

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.780
And I come up with a little illustration of it.

01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:12.560
I often put it to them and say,

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:14.960
is your view of religion like this?

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:16.760
You've got a ceremony at the beginning,

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:20.760
some sort of initiation that puts you on a path.

01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:23.920
And I usually draw a wavy line ups and downs.

01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:26.720
And you stay on the path, the sick full path

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:29.600
or whatever it is, the way, et cetera.

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.680
And you've got various people to help you,

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:35.160
priests, gurus, imams, all the rest of it.

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:39.040
And then you come to a gate at the end,

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:42.120
where I draw some scales of justice.

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:46.120
And at the end, you're faced with an assessment

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:50.280
of your behavior and your deeds up to that point.

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:54.160
And if you pass the grade, you get accepted

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:58.560
into whatever it is, nirvana, heaven, or whatever.

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:02.440
And most people will tell me that is what we believe.

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:05.000
And I say, perhaps the best way to think about it

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.520
is like a university course.

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:12.360
You have an entrance and then you study at the university,

01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:13.800
every university in Britain

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:15.580
and around the world works this way.

01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:18.320
The professors may be the best in the world,

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:21.400
but they cannot guarantee you a degree.

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:22.240
Why?

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:25.520
Because the whole principle of universities

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.320
is you get a degree on the basis of your merit.

01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:33.800
And if you don't earn it, merit it, you don't get it, yes?

01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:36.080
And many people say, yes, that is religion.

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.860
I've been told that by hundreds of people.

01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:41.880
Well, I said, you see, that isn't Christianity.

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:43.880
And they say, oh, yes, it is.

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:46.000
Now, here's where the problem lies.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.560
Many people think that Christianity is like that.

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:54.600
You pile up your good deeds, you try and please God,

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.320
and you hope at the end that he won't take his law too seriously

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.960
and will let you in.

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:03.880
But you see, it's not like that, folks.

01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:07.920
Christianity, the acceptance is not

01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:12.160
at the end of the journey of the judgment.

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:16.720
It's at the beginning of the journey at the cross.

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.160
Now, this is utterly revolutionary.

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:26.000
In that sense, Christianity is not a religion.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.280
It isn't.

01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:31.560
It certainly has a path and a way.

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:37.520
But the path follows acceptance.

01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:40.080
It doesn't come before it.

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:43.960
Because the unique thing about Christianity

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:48.200
is that at the very beginning, what Jesus offers me

01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:52.560
is that if I repent, that is, turn away

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:55.320
from the mess I've made of life, and maybe other people's

01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:01.200
lives, sadly, and trust him as Savior and Lord who died for me,

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:04.600
then he will give me then, right then, the acceptance.

01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:10.760
That's hugely important.

01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:13.280
You see, let me give you an illustration.

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:16.560
This is so important because I meet dozens of people

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.560
that don't understand this.

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.680
Even in this country, 56 years ago now, nearly,

01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:25.080
I met a girl.

01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:27.280
She was lovely.

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:30.720
So I decided I'd like to marry her.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:34.640
So I came along, and I gave her a lovely present.

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.600
It was wrapped up, and I said, Sally,

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:39.360
I'd like you to be my wife.

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:40.480
Now, here's the present.

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:44.000
So she opened it, and it was a cookbook.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:50.520
So I said, read page 153.

01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:52.240
Apple cake.

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:54.640
Thou shall take so much flour.

01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:56.600
Thou shall take so much sugar.

01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:59.880
Thou shall put it in the oven and bake it, and so on.

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:05.040
Now, I said, my dear, I would like you to take this book.

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:07.560
And if you keep these rules, let's say,

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:11.840
let's be reasonable, for the next 40 years,

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:15.800
then I will accept you.

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:19.840
Otherwise, you can go back to your mother.

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.240
Why are you laughing, folks?

01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:27.080
That is how millions of people think about God.

01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:32.080
You would never insult a fellow human being.

01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:34.200
And I mean this very seriously.

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:39.000
You would never insult a fellow human being

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.720
by making acceptance dependent on their performance.

01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:46.000
Do you think God does that?

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.720
That's turning God into a monster.

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:48.760
And that's why you laughed.

01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:49.760
It's ridiculous.

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:51.120
Of course, I didn't do that.

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:55.720
Now, the amazing thing is she accepted me.

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:57.840
It's not amazing that I accepted her,

01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.920
but it's amazing she accepted me.

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.280
And what does that do?

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:04.680
Does that mean she doesn't care about how she lives

01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:05.880
and how she cooks?

01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:08.840
Of course not.

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:13.080
But she's not cooking to earn my affection.

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.960
She's cooking because she's got it.

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:20.160
And here am I tonight talking to you, interviewing.

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:21.880
Why do you think I do it?

01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:24.800
Do you think I'm doing it to earn brownie points

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.480
that God will accept me, not at all?

01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.800
I'm doing it because I know my acceptance

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:32.360
doesn't depend on it.

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.560
And that's the difference.

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:34.760
Now, let me put it this way.

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:37.240
So it's really sharp in your minds.

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:42.040
And it could help you to explain this to people.

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:47.160
Christianity does not compete with any other religion.

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.920
Why not?

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:51.320
Because Jesus offers me something.

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:54.280
None of them offer me.

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:59.120
So it's a no-brainer here to accept from him something

01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:00.680
that nobody else offers me.

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:04.240
Nobody else offers me forgiveness on such terms

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:07.240
and acceptance and love at the very beginning

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.360
and a relationship.

01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:11.960
And that's the reason I'm a Christian.

01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:12.960
Thank you.

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:13.960
Thank you.

01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:14.960
Thank you.

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:15.960
Thank you.

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:16.960
Thank you.

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:17.960
Thank you.

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:18.960
Wow.

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:19.960
Thank you so much.

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:20.960
Thank you.

01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:21.960
Thank you again.

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:22.960
Thank you again to John.

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:23.960
Thank you to Samuel.

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:30.520
And just as we close out, Virgil is going to come and give us

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:33.960
a little bit of a welcome and some thank yous as well.

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:35.080
Yes.

01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:38.160
Well, we've had a wonderful evening.

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:39.160
Do you agree?

Yes.

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:48.000

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.320
We started talking about this in May.

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:53.840
And little did we know that we'd come and end up in

01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:58.440
Central London filling a famous place like this with so many

01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:03.280
young people and Romanian people interested to hear from an English professor

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:07.200
from Oxford born in Ireland.

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:10.640
Then again, we want to thank Professor Lennox for this extraordinary

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:13.880
and very enlightening evening.

01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:17.960
We want to thank the organizer, the Ezra Christian Center, and its

01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:22.440

01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:25.760
Also a warm thank you to our generous sponsors.

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:29.360
Without her this evening would not have been possible.

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:34.560

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:18.920
to Westminster Chapel for their very generous offer of this premises

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:20.160
for the evening.

01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:25.600
They've been very kind to us and they've been very helpful in every respect.

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:28.680
And thank you of the AV team from this place as well.

01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:41.480
We often read in Romania books written by C.S.

01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:49.800
Lewis, books by John Lennox and many books by Martin Lloyd Jones.

01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:52.960
Here we are tonight in the very place where he preached.

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:59.400
I want to point out that we had people tonight coming as far as Scotland,

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:03.800

01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:05.160
So well done, guys.

01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:15.360
Often forgotten and overlooked, I want to commend our wonderful volunteers

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:20.080
who have worked for the whole afternoon here to arrange the chairs to make this

01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:24.120
meeting possible, and they will be working long into the night after all

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:25.520
this is going to be over.

01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:26.720
Please do applaud them.

01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:27.720
Thank you.

01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:40.280
Obviously, we cannot not mention God.

01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:48.720

Make them travel light back home.

01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.240
Spend money.

01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:02.320
It's going to be money well spent by Justin's books as well.
