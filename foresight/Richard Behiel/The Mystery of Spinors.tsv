0	9160	Hey y'all, today we'll be talking about spinners. These things are really cool. Once you learn
9160	14540	about spinners, your life will never be the same. You'll develop a lingering, justified
14540	20180	suspicion that this world is not as it seems. And you might also develop a lifelong addiction
20180	23600	to physics. So, you've been warned.
23600	28040	To set the tone, I'd like to start off with a quote by the renowned mathematician, fields
28040	35400	metallist and knight, Sir Michael Atia. No one fully understands spinners. Their algebra
35400	41640	is formally understood, but their general significance is mysterious. In some sense,
41640	46160	they describe the square root of geometry, and just as understanding the square root
46160	52560	of negative one took centuries, the same might be true of spinners. Michael was an extraordinary
52560	57600	mathematician, and if he of all people says that no one fully understands spinners, then
57680	61440	it's okay if we're a little confused when we first learn about spinners. Spinners are
61440	66040	confusing, frankly they're disorienting, and not particularly intuitive. You know, if you tell
66040	69960	someone there's a thing that you have to rotate twice to get back to where it started, they might
69960	74240	think you're a little insane. But really, the insane thing is that spinners are not insane.
74240	78520	They're mathematically coherent, they show up in our most fundamental laws of physics,
78520	84000	and they refuse to go away. Spinners are really at the core of fundamental physics. I mean,
84000	88480	look at the way function of an electron, for example, or any fermion for that matter. If not
88480	92720	for spinners, we wouldn't have the poly exclusion principle, and so we wouldn't have chemistry.
92720	98640	Matter would collapse, and the world would be a very boring place. So there's no way of restructuring
98640	104040	physics in a way that you don't have spinners, and therefore these strange weird little mathematical
104040	107760	objects we do actually have to deal with, and we have to work with, and we have to understand,
107760	113200	where does this come from, what does it mean, why do these things exist, and it's really mysterious.
114160	119760	Okay, but what is a spinner? Hmm. Well, in the last few videos, we've been developing some of the
119760	123760	basics of relativistic quantum physics. We've looked at Klein-Gordon, we've looked at the
123760	127840	Dirac equation, we've looked at an example of Dirac equation for the eigenstate of a particle
127840	133120	at rest, and while we've done that, we've seen that spinners have emerged as the sort of two
133120	138960	component complex numbers. But today, I don't just want to define spinners as a pair of complex
138960	144560	numbers, because that's not particularly geometrically insightful. Instead, I want to show you an
144560	149200	argument for why we should expect something like spinners to exist in the first place,
149200	154560	and we'll do that by exploring a very subtle thing about the way objects rotate in three dimensions.
155120	159360	That'll open up a crack in reality that we can use to smuggle spinners into our imagination.
160080	163840	Then after that, we can explore the algebraic properties of spinners, we can see where the
163840	167680	complex numbers come in, we can see how we can draw spinners as flags, we can look at how they
167680	172000	transform under rotations, and finally, we'll tie it all back into the Dirac equation and we'll
172000	176880	talk about how this relates to electrons. This video will hopefully answer many questions,
176880	181600	and it'll surely raise many more. Spinners are one of those things where the more you
181600	184400	learn about them, the more wonderful and magical they become.
189200	194720	Before we talk about rotations, there are a few vocabulary words that we need to borrow from
194720	204320	topology. These are homotopic, simply connected, and homotopy class. So imagine we have a whiteboard,
204880	210880	and we've drawn a squiggly loop. The loop is alive and sentient and is feeling its way around
210880	217280	the whiteboard. As it goes along, in each moment it takes on a different shape, but it doesn't
217280	224240	break apart. It can stretch and shrink, but it can't be cut, and from one moment to the next,
224240	230240	its topology stays the same. The fancy way to say this is that it's evolving into different
230240	237520	loops that are all homotopic. Homo is in same, and topic is in topology, so homotopic means
237520	243600	that they have the same topology. Oh, whoa, little guy's getting nervous. Eh, that's okay.
243600	249120	Stage fright, you know, it's understandable. Oh, there it goes, shrinking down to a point.
249120	253760	It's a defense mechanism. That's fine, you know, I'm a bit shy myself, so who am I to judge?
254480	258880	Anyway, the reason our loop was able to shrink like that is that there wasn't an obstacle,
258880	264480	or a hole, or something weird that got in its way. Instead, it just had a nice, smooth,
264480	271120	simple space, so it was able to shrink on down to a point. And that is our next vocabulary word,
271120	278000	simply connected. A space is simply connected if all the loops that live in the space
278000	283120	can shrink down to a point whenever they want to. But now what if we take our whiteboard
283120	287920	and we drill a hole in the middle? So now as the loop explores its environment,
287920	292320	it goes around and it realizes that it can't go into the hole and it can't escape the board,
292880	298400	but it can still shrink if it wants to, so no problems there. But now consider this little guy,
298400	302480	which was born into quite a predicament. It's wrapped all the way around the hole,
302480	307840	so it can't shrink down to a point. When it's feeling shy, at best it can only become a small
307920	314160	circle, not a point. So that tells us that this space, whiteboard with a hole in it,
314160	321120	is not simply connected. So now think about this, the loop on the left can evolve into a variety
321120	326160	of different shapes that are all homotopic to each other. All the different forms that it can
326160	332400	take on are all a loop that lives between the hole and the edge of the whiteboard. Likewise,
332400	336640	the loop on the right can also evolve into many different homotopic shapes,
336640	341520	but those are all wrapped around the hole. And so you see here we have two different
341520	347280	homotopic classes, class in the sense of like a set of entities that all have something in common.
348800	353200	So we can say that the loops fall into different classes depending on whether or not they wrap
353200	358320	around the hole. And actually it's a bit more complicated than that because in this case you
358320	363440	could also have loops that wrap around the hole multiple times. And so we actually have a different
363440	368640	homotopic class for each number of times it wraps around. And so the winding number matters,
368640	373040	the number of times that the curve is wound around the hole that matters. But those are all
373040	378320	the homotopic classes of loops on the whiteboard. You can organize them just by specifying the so
378320	383280	called winding number. And a curve that has a certain winding number cannot be continuously
383280	388000	deformed into having a different winding number. So you can stretch them and shrink them but you
388000	392320	can't change the winding number unless you cut the loop which is not allowed. This hurts the loop.
392960	399440	Do not hurt the loop. Okay. Oh by the way in this context the loop can pass through itself so we
399440	403360	don't have to worry about the loop getting tangled up in knots and what are the different kinds of
403360	407840	knots and all that. No no it doesn't matter. The purpose of these loops are not to model like
407840	412960	physical rubber bands but just to tell us something about the nature of the space in which they live.
414000	419840	Oh one more thing on this topic. Imagine we repair the whiteboard so there's no more hole.
419840	424160	But now it has the magical property that the left and right edges of the board
424160	429600	are identified with each other such that the loop can appear to teleport from one side to the other.
430720	434640	So there's no longer a hole in the board but there is this weird teleporting situation.
436080	441840	So now is this space simply connected? To address that question we have to think about
441840	446560	what it means for the curve to teleport like this from one side to the other without breaking.
447520	452160	That means that each point on the left side of the board and the opposite point on the right side
452160	458320	of the board must be literally the same point. So we realize that this space is actually the
458320	464400	surface of a cylinder without the top and bottom circles. And so from that point of view no the
464400	470160	space is not simply connected because in addition to loops that can shrink to a point we also have
470160	475440	the possibility of loops that wrap around the cylinder and those cannot shrink to a point.
476320	481040	Now when we look at those loops on the whiteboard they look like weird teleporting lines not loops.
481840	486160	But when we're looking at the three-dimensional view that really shows the nature of the space
486160	491040	without any cuts and teleports but we see the real space the real for real like how it actually is
491680	497600	then we can see that indeed this is a loop and it cannot be shrunk to a point. By the way here
497600	502320	again it's the same exact situation as before where we can also have different winding numbers
502320	508320	and it turns out that all the homotopy classes of loops on a cylinder can be organized simply by
508320	515200	their winding number. It's not a coincidence that the hole in the whiteboard and the cylinder have
515200	520480	the same set of homotopy classes because if you think about it a whiteboard with a hole in it well
520480	526160	that's a cd and a cd is a lamp shade and a lamp shade is a cylinder so therefore whiteboard with
526160	531760	a hole in it is a cylinder. I love topology. You know the difference between geometry and
531760	537920	topology. In geometry you take your ruler and your protractor and you draw lines and angles and shapes.
538560	542880	In topology you take your ruler and your protractor and you throw them out the window.
544240	550000	Okay so now we know about homotopy simply connected and homotopy class. We also know
550000	555600	that if a space seems like it has teleports from one side to the other this might actually be a
555600	561280	totally continuous space with no teleports but embedded in a higher dimension such that you can
561280	566400	actually pull those points together. Now we're going to apply these concepts to the group of
566400	572240	rotations in three dimensions but first we have to specify what even is the group of rotations in
572240	579360	three dimensions. Let's say we have a cube and let's go ahead and stick a flag in it to make
579360	585120	it really easy to see how the cube is oriented. Now let me ask you this if we rotate this cube
585680	590960	what are all the different ways it can be oriented and how can we represent that set
590960	595600	of all possible orientations? Well there's a couple different ways of going about this and
595600	600960	they're all basically the same but probably the easiest way is to notice that every orientation
600960	607760	can be defined with some axis of rotation and some amount of rotation around that axis and this is
607760	614160	known as the axis angle representation. So what this means is that let's say we have some reference
614240	620400	flag that's say pointing up and in a certain direction then we can get to any other flag
620400	627760	orientation just by rotating the reference flag some amount around some axis. This fact is not
627760	633520	obvious but it is true it follows as a direct consequence of Euler's rotation theorem.
636320	642640	Okay now let's introduce the concept of an axis angle rotation vector so what this vector is
642960	650720	it points in the direction of the axis of rotation and its length is the amount of rotation so here
650720	656400	I'm showing a cube rotating around a single axis and you can see that as the vector grows and shrinks
656400	662560	the cube is rotated more or less around that axis and so if you think about it what is the
662560	667200	space of rotations in three dimensions? If you wanted to categorize everything how can we possibly
667200	672080	come up with some kind of space that encodes every which way a thing can be oriented?
673040	677600	Well it's the space of all directions multiplied by the space of all lengths
678560	683440	but it's a little bit tricky because it's not really the space of all lengths you know if you
683440	689120	rotate 180 degrees around some axis that's the same as rotating 180 around the opposite axis
689840	695440	so actually what you want to imagine is like a sphere where if the vector pokes through the
695440	700880	sphere by the way the sphere has radius of 180 degrees or pi if you want but when it goes
700880	705360	through the sphere then it ends up teleporting to the exact opposite side of the sphere
705360	710400	and it ends up coming back in if you keep rotating it see because what happens here and here we'll
710400	715680	just go along a single axis to make it easy to see but as the vector grows and grows the thing
715680	721680	rotates it gets to 180 and at that point we're going to map its rotation vector onto the opposite
721680	726320	axis 180 and then we're going to keep rotating and that's going to keep coming in and coming in
726320	731200	which is like a lesser and lesser rotation around that opposite axis until finally it ends up back
731200	737600	where it started and so in summary the space of all possible rotations in three dimensions
737600	743040	can be represented as a ball a ball meaning a sphere and also the volume contained within it
743040	749760	of radius 180 degrees where every point on the spherical boundary of the ball is identified with
749760	755520	the exact opposite point such that if you go outside of the sphere you seem to get teleported
755520	759840	back through the other side of the sphere but remember this is not actually a teleport there's
759840	765280	not actually anything discontinuous happening here this apparent teleport is just an artifact of the
765280	770880	way we're drawing this space in reality the space of rotations in three dimensions ironically doesn't
770880	776560	really fit in three dimensions and that's not that weird because if you think about it what we
776560	782240	have here is an abstract space that represents every possible kind of rotation so that's a different
782240	787360	kind of thing than the space that we're rotating within so it's actually not that weird that this
787360	792560	space ends up having this kind of topologically interesting character but a lot of weird things
792560	797440	follow as a consequence of that as we're about to see what i want to show you now is that there
797440	803840	are different kinds of ways to rotate an object back to its original orientation and that seems
803840	808800	weird because you'd think any way you rotate an object back to itself it should all be the same
808880	813520	right there shouldn't really be a meaningful distinction between how you go about doing that
813520	819760	but that's not actually the case so first let's recognize that if we rotate an object back to
819760	825440	its original orientation what that means in our axis angle space is that we're starting with the
825440	830640	zero vector at the origin meaning no rotation then the vector is going to go out and grow in
830640	835920	some direction and it can move around and in general it can do whatever it wants to do it can
835920	840800	teleport if it goes more than 180 whatever the case may be but in order to return to the original
840800	847840	orientation it has to come back to the zero vector so the space of all possible ways to orient an
847840	854240	object back to itself is exactly the space of all possible closed loops in this axis angle
854240	860240	representation there is one caveat here which is that when we look at loops in the axis angle
860240	866160	representation we should think of it only as going around the loop once for reasons that we'll see
866160	872320	in a moment and so what we're gonna do actually tell you what we're gonna take a circular cross
872320	878640	section so not the full three-dimensional ball but actually just a two-dimensional disc now this is
878640	883520	just a slice it's just a cross section but it's easier to look at than the full three-dimensional
883520	888560	thing and what i want to show you about there being different ways of rotating things all of that we
888560	894320	can see by examining this cross section and then we'll see that the same exact concepts easily
894320	899120	generalize into the full three-dimensional space now when we look at these loops i'm also going to
899120	904720	use a color map that winds around the rainbow and then comes back to the starting color and what
904720	909680	that's going to do is that's going to highlight for us the continuity of the loop and in a similar
909680	914880	spirit i'm also going to put a little dot on the loop that just goes around and around and so when
914880	919680	we're looking at teleports the ball is going to help us visualize which parts of the curve are
919680	926160	connected to which other parts of the curve but remember each of these loops only corresponds
926160	932080	to rotating an object once around this particular loop okay and that's important because as we'll
932080	936400	see there's a difference between going around once or twice or three times or four times and so
936400	940800	there are some subtleties there so in our diagram whenever we have a loop think about it as that
940880	945360	represents rotating the object one time around this path in the space of rotations
946400	949920	all right well with all that said let's go ahead and start to explore some of the different
949920	957280	kinds of loops we have in this axis angle space the first kind of loop that we'll look at is
957280	963040	maybe the simplest kind it's just a small loop that stays totally within the boundaries of the
963040	969680	diagram and this corresponds to a wiggle where the cube never rotates more than 180 degrees around
969680	974400	any axis it just sort of wiggles around for a bit and then returns to where it started
975280	980480	as you can imagine this loop is homotopic to any other wiggle that stays within the
980480	984560	boundary and passes through the origin because you can always just imagine stretching it and
984560	990480	shrinking it and exploring the entire homotopy class of wiggles and again these loops can pass
990480	993920	through themselves so we don't have to worry about the question of knots and the different
993920	1000560	kinds of knots so aside from wiggles what other homotopy classes might there be well consider
1000560	1007360	a cube that rotates once along some axis so it does a full 360 that means that its loop is going
1007360	1013520	to start at the origin and then it's going to go out to 180 degrees then it'll come back in
1013520	1019760	along the opposite axis and finally it'll return to the origin again having completed a full 360
1019840	1025840	degree rotation now that's a rotation right that's not just a wiggle that's a full rotation and by
1025840	1030240	the way if you look at the loop it might not look like a loop it looks more like a weird teleporting
1030240	1036240	line but remember the cylinder and remember that the apparent teleportation here is just an artifact
1036240	1041840	of the way we're drawing the space but it doesn't represent any real discontinuity in the space you
1041840	1047280	have to imagine that the space is curvy in a way that doesn't really fit in the dimensionality
1047280	1052320	of your screen and so the points that the curve appears to teleport through are actually literally
1052320	1058560	the same point and in this diagram all pairs of opposite points are literally the same point
1058560	1063840	now this kind of loop is a genuine rotation i mean look it goes all the way around it's way more
1063840	1070320	than just a wiggle it's a full 360 and you can see that it can't be reduced to a wiggle because
1070320	1075440	there's no way of continuously deforming this loop into a loop that doesn't cross the circular
1075440	1081600	boundary without cutting it okay so then now we have at least two different homotopy classes of
1081600	1088560	loops in the axis angle space wiggles and full rotations so the space of rotations in three
1088560	1093840	dimensions is not simply connected which is really surprising right you wouldn't necessarily expect
1093840	1098880	that but here we can very clearly see that there are at least two totally distinct homotopy classes
1098880	1103840	of loops in the space of rotations in three dimensions and you know that's just a fundamental
1103840	1109920	fact of reality all right well this feels similar to the cylinder example where you had loops that
1109920	1114240	didn't teleport and you also had loops that teleported and then you had like multiple winding
1114240	1120160	numbers of teleportations and so we might expect to find infinitely many homotopy classes here for
1120160	1125760	the rotations depending on how many times the loop goes through the boundary but surprisingly
1125760	1132720	that's not the case there are actually only two different homotopy classes consider for example
1132720	1139120	the fact that a wiggle is homotopic to an octopus that's gotta be a brand new sentence i don't think
1139120	1145200	anyone's ever said that you're hearing it first here folks freshly minted sentence okay so the
1145200	1151280	wiggle crosses the boundary zero times but the octopus crosses many times and yet the two are
1151280	1155120	totally homotopic as you can see as we're going back and forth between these two you see they're
1155120	1160320	homotopic it's all continuous transformations here there's no cutting so we don't have one
1160320	1165200	homotopy class for each winding number like we did with the cylinder because now it's a different
1165200	1170240	kind of teleporting boundary the boundary is round and has a different geometry and so the
1170240	1175600	loops can slip around and slip through the boundary and what that ends up doing is it means that you
1175600	1182240	can always add or subtract two boundary crossings by continuously deforming the loop see for another
1182240	1187200	example let's say we have a rotation that teleports once and by the way each pair of points here
1187200	1192080	we're counting as one crossing notice they're the same color they're really the same point
1192080	1195680	it looks like two points on our diagram but that's an artifact of the way we're drawing a diagram
1195680	1200640	okay so this is one crossing but you can show that this loop is homotopic to a loop that teleports
1200640	1207280	multiple times but when you do that with this loop because it started off crossing once you can only
1207280	1213920	ever get to an odd number of crossings and so as it turns out we only have two homotopy classes
1214560	1218480	and they're based on whether we have an odd number or an even number of teleports
1219360	1223760	you can see this by noticing that you can always pull part of the loop through the circular boundary
1224320	1229680	but when you do so you'll always pull two line segments at a time because we're grabbing onto
1229680	1234480	a closed loop and that's just how it is and by the way you can see that this argument generalizes
1234480	1240160	not just to the circular cross section but also to the whole spherical situation because it doesn't
1240160	1244160	matter whether you're pulling a loop through a circular boundary or a spherical boundary
1244160	1248160	because either way the loop is going to come through two line segments at a time when you
1248160	1254000	pull on it so this thing about the two homotopy classes even though we've demonstrated that for
1254000	1260480	this circular cross section it actually does hold true for the entire space of rotations in three
1260480	1266400	dimensions oh and here let's go ahead and introduce some terminology so we'll say that a loop is
1266400	1271920	class one if it has an odd number of teleports and we'll say it's class two if it has an even number
1272720	1275440	this is easy to remember because one is odd and two is even
1277520	1282160	you know we've now arrived at a checkpoint like in a video game when you get to a certain level
1282160	1286800	and your progress is saved you'll want to make sure that you're really comfortable with all of
1286800	1292080	these ideas discussed so far because we're about to get algebraic and it makes all the
1292400	1297120	difference in the world if you're able to see and to feel in your soul that the rotations in
1297120	1301360	three dimensions are not simply connected but actually have two different homotopy classes
1301360	1307120	of loops i really want to emphasize that this is a fundamental insight a pivotal transformation of
1307120	1312000	your worldview that you have to go through if you want to study spinners you know even though we
1312000	1316960	haven't used any equations yet there's a lot to think about here and it may take a while to digest
1316960	1322320	these ideas i know it took me a while so it's worth meditating on these concepts until they become
1322320	1327680	second nature because seeing that the rotations aren't simply connected but have rather two
1327680	1332560	homotopy classes is really the difference between your intuition holding you back and pulling you
1332560	1338960	forward if you get this concept about two homotopy classes if you really feel it then instinctively
1338960	1343600	you'll suspect that maybe there might be some mathematical object that is sensitive to the
1344080	1349280	class of rotations and so it would necessarily have to double cover the space of rotations
1349280	1353840	and it might not exactly return to itself after a single rotation but instead might pick up some
1353840	1358480	phase factor that alternates depending on whether it's a class one or a class two and so if you
1358480	1363040	really get this then your imagination is going to pull you in the direction of spinners you'll
1363040	1367440	yearn for them even before you've seen what they are and you'll be prepared and excited when it
1367440	1376960	comes time to actually write an equation all right let's get algebraic so we have this idea
1376960	1383760	of an axis angle representation of a rotation and now the question is how do we actually work
1383760	1390080	with this what do we do with this let's say we have some rotation vector and we want to say okay
1390080	1396160	i want to rotate an object in accordance with that axis angle vector what equation do i write
1396160	1400560	what code do i put in the computer what do i do and i want to tell you about two different
1400560	1407520	ways of rotating an object the vector way and the spinner way so i want to focus on the vector way
1407520	1413280	first and this involves rotation matrices and then later i'll talk about the spinner way and this
1413280	1421200	involves su2 matrices so starting with the vector way of rotating things um actually you know what
1421280	1426560	here first we're going to go into two dimensions i'll show you how to rotate vectors i'll show
1426560	1431520	you the implications for this vis-a-vis rotating objects and then we'll expand up into three
1431520	1435440	dimensions but i'll use the two dimensions as an example to lay out some of the mathematical
1435440	1441520	framework all right so imagine we're in a two-dimensional space and we have a unit vector
1441520	1446960	pointing along the x-axis and you know a unit vector along the x-axis is kind of the simplest
1446960	1451920	thing you can put in a vector space so we're going to use that as our reference object because
1451920	1457440	you know no need to over complicate it now in order to rotate this vector what we can do is we
1457440	1464080	can construct something called a rotation matrix in two dimensions the rotation matrix about some
1464080	1472320	counterclockwise angle theta has the form cosine of theta negative sine theta sine of theta cosine
1472320	1478800	of theta and if you investigate the properties of this matrix you'll find two things first the
1478800	1484800	inverse of the matrix is the transpose of the matrix so if you transpose the matrix and if you
1484800	1489360	take the inverse that's the same thing and another way of writing that is that the matrix times the
1489360	1495200	transpose equals the identity matrix so that's the first thing and that means that the matrix is
1495200	1502720	orthogonal so in the inverse of a matrix equals its transpose that is an orthogonal matrix and
1502720	1508800	another thing we can see by inspection is that this matrix has determinant one because you know
1508800	1514000	cosine squared plus sine squared is one so our matrix is orthogonal and it has determinant one
1514000	1519520	and so the fancy word for that is it is a special orthogonal matrix in particular it's a special
1519520	1526000	orthogonal two by two matrix and so what we say is it is an s o two matrix so a rotation matrix in
1526000	1531840	two dimensions is also known as an s o two matrix oh by the way even though we're talking about s o
1531840	1539280	two in terms of matrices the term s o two can also refer to the group of rotations in two dimensions
1539280	1545360	in a more general sense whether or not we use matrices to represent them for example instead
1545360	1551280	we could represent 2d rotations with unit complex numbers and complex multiplication
1551280	1556240	because the group of e to the i theta's under complex multiplication is isomorphic to the group
1556240	1561200	of s o two matrices under matrix multiplication and that's a neat little connection there between
1561200	1565440	the complex numbers and the s o two matrices we'll see in a moment that there's a similar
1565440	1571120	connection between the quaternions and vsu two matrices but more on that later but for now i just
1571120	1575760	wanted to let you know that there are many equivalent ways to reformulate all of these concepts
1575760	1581440	but i like the matrix representation because it's very mechanical and transparent now if we
1581440	1589040	look at this blue thing swinging around we realize that we can use the set of all rotated blue vectors
1589040	1596960	to visualize the set of all s o two matrices because if we define the unit vector along x
1596960	1605040	as a reference vector then each s o two rotation matrix corresponds to one and only one rotated
1605040	1611520	unit vector so if you tell me hey here's a reference vector and now here's a rotated vector
1611520	1616880	then by looking at how rotated the rotated vector is i can figure out what s o two matrix was
1616880	1622080	responsible for the rotation likewise if you give me an s o two matrix and a reference vector
1622080	1626400	then i can draw you the rotated vector so there's a one-to-one correspondence here
1626960	1632000	and this is true regardless of what reference vector we pick no matter its length or orientation
1632000	1635600	which you can prove to yourself by skeptically tilting your head and leaning back
1636960	1642560	so anyway we can see that we can loop through the s o two matrices in a periodic way passing
1642560	1647040	through each of them in order of increasing angle and then ending up back where we started
1647760	1653920	and so we can see that the topology of s o two is just a circle and that's why s o two is also
1653920	1660800	called the circle group so in two dimensions we can represent an s o two matrix in other words
1660800	1667520	a rotation with just a vector but when we go to three dimensions because of the extra degree of
1667520	1673440	freedom uh we're gonna have to use a flag and the reason we're using a flag is because if you
1673440	1678480	just had a vector in three dimensions then that kind of points in a certain direction but then
1678480	1684400	there's the question of how is the vector rotated along its axis and so with a flag we can see that
1684400	1689600	flag rotation angle and so we can use that to represent the rotations in three dimensions but
1689600	1694480	before we get into three dimensions i want to show you how to rotate a flag in two dimensions
1694480	1700240	and basically the way to do it is just imagine the vector that points from the origin to each
1700240	1705600	of the interesting points on the flag so the zero vector points to the flagpole base then you
1705600	1710080	have a vector that points to the top of the flagpole a couple of vectors that point out to the sides
1710080	1714320	of the flag and then another vector that points along the flagpole to the point where the flag
1714320	1719920	meets the flagpole so basically we just treat those five points as vectors and you apply a
1719920	1725840	rotation matrix to those vectors and as it turns out the whole pattern of the flag will rotate
1725840	1731280	when you do this and that's because rotation matrices preserve the relative lengths and
1731280	1736880	angles of vectors that they're transforming and so any lines drawn between two vectors which is
1736880	1741520	also the difference of those two vectors will transform in the same way as all of the other
1741520	1747680	vectors now here's a view where we offset the flag from the origin so here this really drives
1747680	1752400	the point home that if you have some shape made out of vectors and you rotate all the vectors
1752480	1757760	you end up rotating the shape there's a couple of other concepts I wanted to touch on while we're
1757760	1764720	here for example what would happen if we scaled up our rotation matrix so that its determinant
1764720	1770000	were greater than one well now it would no longer be a special orthogonal matrix but it would still
1770000	1775280	be a matrix and it would still transform a vector field and as you can see from this animation if
1775280	1780480	we take a rotation matrix and scale it up so that its determinant is greater than one then that's
1780560	1786800	just going to expand all of the vectors likewise if we scale down a rotation matrix so that its
1786800	1791520	determinant becomes less than one then that's going to shrink the vectors and the reason I
1791520	1796800	bring this up is so that you can see the connection between a matrix having determinant one and a
1796800	1801600	matrix doing a rotation transform because with a rotation we don't want to expand or shrink
1801600	1805760	vectors we want to keep them the same length and by the way when you're transforming a vector space
1805760	1811600	with a matrix it's not always a uniform expansion or contraction sometimes you can also get a skew
1811600	1818560	and a matrix that skews a vector space is not an orthogonal matrix because it doesn't preserve the
1818560	1822720	relative lengths and angles of the vector field you know it squishes them and so anyway that's
1822720	1828080	another reason why we want to use a special orthogonal matrix for rotations because they
1828080	1834480	don't skew the vector field oh and also if we go ahead and allow the determinant to go negative
1834560	1839600	you can see that an inversion of the vector field happens and by the way I know this looks
1839600	1844480	kind of three-dimensional but it's actually two-dimensional and it's getting squished along
1844480	1849520	one axis until it flips around and goes out on the other axis while at the same time I'm rotating it
1849520	1853360	but anyway the main thing I wanted to show you there is that an inversion can happen when the
1853360	1859520	determinant goes negative so I hope these examples of growing and shrinking and skewing and inverting
1859520	1865680	vectors gives you some sense of why we want to use special orthogonal matrices to do rotations
1868320	1874240	okay so now that we're experts on SO2 and rotations in two dimensions we'll go ahead and
1874240	1880720	pop up into the third dimension a lot of what we just talked about in 2d will transfer directly
1880720	1887120	over to 3d but of course now we're in an expanded environment so some of the concepts will be adjusted
1887120	1893760	accordingly but something I want to emphasize is that all of this special orthogonal terminology
1893760	1899440	gives us a precise way to describe what kinds of matrices we're looking for regardless of the
1899440	1906320	dimensionality of the space that we're in because all of the same intuitions apply in 3d as in 2d
1906320	1911920	about not wanting to grow the vectors or shrink or skew or invert anything and so what we're
1911920	1920240	looking for now are SO3 matrices that is special orthogonal 3x3 matrices where the same constraints
1920240	1925760	apply about the inverse being the transpose and the determinant being 1 but now there's just an
1925760	1933280	additional dimension and so the essence of special orthogonality is the essence of rotation and yes
1933280	1939520	by the way this also applies in higher dimensions but save our tears for another day so anyway
1939600	1946400	earlier we saw that given some rotation angle theta we can construct the 2d rotation matrix as
1946400	1953360	cosine negative sine sine cosine but now in three dimensions instead of just an angle for the rotation
1953920	1959680	we now have an axis angle vector like we talked about earlier and so we're faced with the question
1959680	1967440	of how do we write the SO3 matrix that goes with any particular axis angle vector this is actually
1967440	1973760	quite a difficult problem but don't worry it was solved in 1840 by Alinde Rodriguez and the
1973760	1980000	solution is called the Rodriguez formula the Rodriguez formula is just a recipe for converting
1980000	1986400	an axis angle vector into the SO3 matrix that does that rotation so you take an axis angle vector
1986400	1991520	put it into the Rodriguez formula and out pops your SO3 matrix and then you take that SO3 matrix
1991520	1995760	you just slap it onto a vector and it rotates the vector and that's how that works that's how
1995760	2002000	you rotate vectors in 3d it's pretty neat so in theory in principle according to everyone's
2002000	2008080	intuition and imagination that should be good enough if we want to represent rotating any object
2008080	2013120	you should totally be able to just list out a bunch of position vectors of points on the object
2013120	2017440	rotate all your position vectors with special orthogonal matrices and then that should be
2017440	2023440	like all you need to rotate things in math and physics like you should only ever have
2023440	2027680	special orthogonal matrices for rotations like we have it already it's good enough right this is
2027680	2035440	fine well not exactly we got to talk about SU2 SU2 I don't even know where to begin with SU2
2035440	2042320	well here how about this we'll start off by thinking about SU2 as a complex generalization
2042320	2050320	of SO2 let me clarify what I mean by that so think about an SO2 matrix as we've seen you
2050320	2057280	can write an SO2 matrix as cosine theta minus sine sine cosine or equivalently we can say that the
2057280	2066080	general form of an SO2 matrix is a negative b b a with the constraint that a squared plus b squared
2066080	2072800	equals one and you can see that this is the same thing by the substitution a is cosine of theta
2072800	2079200	and b is sine theta and when you write it in terms of a and b and a squared plus b squared equals one
2079280	2085760	you see that we have a unit circle of possible SO2 matrices okay now with that in mind let's
2085760	2093920	look at the definition of an SU2 matrix so an SU2 matrix involves complex elements we'll
2093920	2101280	symbolize them as alpha and beta and it has the form alpha negative beta conjugate beta alpha
2101280	2107840	conjugate where alpha and beta are complex numbers and the magnitude of alpha squared plus the
2107840	2114240	magnitude of beta squared equals one you can see that in the special case that alpha and beta are
2114240	2121680	real numbers then this matrix has the form of an SO2 matrix but because alpha and beta can be complex
2121680	2128720	numbers SU2 is actually a more general kind of matrix than an SO2 matrix it has more degrees of
2128720	2138080	freedom and whereas an SO2 matrix acts on real valued two component vectors an SU2 matrix being
2138080	2146400	complex naturally is going to act on complex valued two component vectors those complex valued two
2146400	2152880	component vectors are called spinners and this is one way of thinking about what a spinner is
2153520	2159680	it's the vector like thing that an SU2 matrix acts upon by the way there are ways of generalizing
2159680	2163360	the concept of spinners using other kinds of matrices but i'm not going to worry about that
2163360	2167840	today today we're just focused on two component complex spinners which are the most common kind
2167840	2173360	of spinner you'll encounter in physics okay now something you can see by exploring the properties
2173360	2181520	of these SU2 matrices is that they have determinant one and that the inverse of the matrix is the
2181600	2188000	complex conjugate transpose of the matrix so this is very very similar to a special orthogonal
2188000	2195200	matrix but technically the correct word now is special unitary matrix where unitary refers to
2195200	2201200	the fact that the inverse of the matrix is the complex conjugate transpose of the matrix and
2201200	2206640	that complex conjugation comes in because the dot product of two complex vectors involves a complex
2206640	2211280	conjugation and so in order to preserve lengths and angles between complex vectors we have to
2211280	2217040	preserve the dot product and so there's a complex conjugation that comes in in order to preserve
2217040	2221200	dot products but anyway i'm not going to go into too much detail on that just know that these are
2221200	2229200	the constraints on SU2 matrices okay so what we've looked at so far is a very algebraic definition
2229200	2235040	of SU2 and what we should look at now is the picture of what do these matrices actually do
2235920	2241200	so the way to do that is to first draw some reference spinner and this will be analogous to
2241200	2246880	the reference vector we looked at when we looked at SU2 and then we're going to multiply it by an
2246880	2253680	SU2 matrix and we're going to see how it transforms so first of all how should we even draw a two
2253680	2258400	component complex vector well there's a lot of different ways of drawing it but today i'm just
2258400	2263760	going to keep it simple we're going to look at one complex plane and then i'll put two dots in the
2263760	2270000	plane corresponding to the two components of the complex vector and i'll draw a line between them
2270000	2275680	just to highlight the point that these two dots are actually two parts of the same object there's
2275680	2279280	another way of looking at all this math in four dimensions but we're not going to get into that
2279280	2287360	today anyway so when we multiply our reference spinner by SU2 matrices we can see that it kind
2287360	2295680	of goes around and it it spins and it transforms in this rotational kind of way and so naturally
2295680	2301760	we can ask the question of what are the degrees of freedom here as we're transforming our spinner
2301760	2306320	how does it evolve and how many degrees of freedom does it have well naively it should
2306320	2310800	have four degrees of freedom right because there is two complex numbers and each complex number
2310800	2316480	has two degrees of freedom in the complex plane but we're going to take out a degree of freedom
2316480	2322400	by virtue of the fact that the su2 matrix has determinant one and is unitary and so what that
2322400	2328000	means is that this spinner is not changing in size and that means that the magnitude squared of the
2328000	2332320	first component plus the magnitude squared of the second component is always going to equal one
2332880	2338640	so we actually have three degrees of freedom here and these three degrees of freedom are isomorphic
2338640	2343600	to the hypersphere which is the locus of points in four dimensions that are all equidistant from
2343600	2347760	the origin which you can see when you think about it right you start off with four pure
2347760	2352240	degrees of freedom and then constrain them so that they have to be constant size what you
2352240	2358000	end up with is a hypersphere interestingly the hypersphere is a simply connected space that'll
2358000	2364640	be really important later but for now just think of these spinners as rotating around spinning around
2364960	2371920	in a way that is simply connected okay so here we have three degrees of freedom
2372960	2379280	and it involves some kind of spinny rotating thing so the question arises does this have any
2379280	2385440	connection to s03 that is the three-dimensional rotations maybe it will maybe it won't right i
2385440	2388480	mean if we're just thinking about it from a mathematical perspective that's a legitimate
2388480	2394160	question to ask and as it turns out shockingly there is a very very close connection between
2394160	2402000	s02 and s03 and in particular s02 double covers s03 let me explain what that means
2402720	2408720	so imagine we have s03 which acts on some three-dimensional vector and rotates it
2410080	2415360	and we also have s02 which is going to act on some two-component complex vector that we call a
2415360	2421120	spinner and it's going to transform it and kind of spin it around what the double cover means is
2421120	2428400	that we can draw a connection between any possible rotation in three dimensions and any possible
2428400	2433680	s02 transformation on these spinners in this two complex dimensional space
2435280	2442160	but the connection is not one to one it's actually two to one for every rotation in three dimensions
2442160	2450240	we have precisely two possible s02 transformations and moreover those two s02 transformations
2450240	2455760	are related to each other in that they only differ by a minus sign so you know at the beginning of
2455760	2460400	the video i mentioned that quote by michael atia where he was talking about how spinners are in
2460400	2466480	some sense the square root of geometry and you really see this in the way that s02 double covers
2466480	2471680	s03 because if you think about it what is the square root of four well it's two but it's also
2471680	2477680	negative two and what is the square root of nine well it's three but it's also negative three so
2477680	2482000	when you take the square root of something you get an answer but you actually get two answers
2482000	2488240	that differ only by a minus sign likewise if you look at any rotation in three dimensions
2488240	2494480	which corresponds to a single s03 element and you ask what is the corresponding s02 element
2495360	2500160	you get an answer but you actually get two answers that are related by a minus sign
2500560	2508160	okay now let's talk about the spinner way of rotating things so because s02
2508160	2514480	double covers s03 there's an intimate connection between every s02 transformation
2515200	2521680	and every rotation in three-dimensional space therefore if we wanted to we could mathematically
2521680	2528560	deal with rotations using the framework of s02 matrices instead of s03 but we would just have
2528640	2533120	to ignore the redundancy that comes with a double cover but that's not really a problem I mean we
2533120	2537280	can literally just ignore the redundancy right we can just project it out let me give you an
2537280	2543600	analogy so suppose that there is a math problem and you have some computer program that calculates
2543600	2549280	the answer but it's kind of slow and it takes a while to run so you run your program you wait a
2549280	2555120	moment while it calculates and then let's say you see that the answer is four well okay if you're
2555120	2560960	not in a rush that method works fine but let's say you're really in a hurry or maybe you have to do
2560960	2566720	a bunch of these calculations super fast so you look for a way to do it faster and then you discover
2566720	2572400	a faster method but the catch is that it doesn't give you the answer but instead it gives you the
2572400	2578720	square root of the answer so if the answer is four then sometimes the fast method gives you two
2578720	2583520	and sometimes it gives you negative two okay fine that's actually not a problem at all because you
2583520	2589040	can just square it and the ambiguity washes out and you've got your answer the same reasoning
2589040	2595520	applies to using su2 to do rotations because it turns out that su2 lends itself to faster
2595520	2601200	more numerically stable calculations than so3 and even though there are two possible spinners
2601200	2607200	for each so3 orientation they only differ by a minus sign which can easily be washed away
2608080	2613200	don't get me wrong so3 is pretty fast too I mean I used like a million so3 matrices while
2613200	2618800	making this video but then again I also rendered these animations overnight I wasn't in a hurry so
2618800	2623440	I just took the easier route in terms of thinking about so3 and axis angle vectors and Rodriguez
2623440	2629280	formula and that worked fine the only time I really had to use su2 for 3d rotations is when
2629280	2634400	making these colored flag animations those are actually based on su2 because I wanted it to
2634400	2640080	match the spinners anyway with animations there's not really a time constraint so you might as well
2640080	2645920	just think in terms of axis angle vectors Rodriguez formula so3 rotation matrices because it's easier
2645920	2651440	on the brain and usually there's no benefit to rotating a vector like a microsecond faster so
2651440	2656960	why torture yourself if you don't have to but if you are writing software for video game graphics
2656960	2662480	or a vision system for a self-driving car or the attitude control system for a rocket then you'll
2662480	2667360	for sure want to use su2 because in those cases you're going to have to rotate a lot of vectors
2667360	2672400	very quickly and the only cost of using su2 is that it's harder to think about when you're
2672400	2678800	writing the code because your imagination has to roll around on a hypersphere and it's kind of dizzying
2678800	2684160	but at the end of the day you'll end up with a code that's faster uses less ram and is more zen
2684160	2691840	than a code that uses so3 the numbers flow more gracefully when you use su2 su2 also lets you
2691840	2698160	avoid the problem of gimbal lock which affects so3 i don't have time to go into it today but google
2698160	2706880	Apollo 11 gimbal lock for a cautionary tale about the perils of so3 also when using su2 for
2706880	2712480	rotations in three dimensions people often use the quaternion representation because it's clean
2712480	2719040	and simple we saw earlier that there's an isomorphism between so2 and the unit complex numbers
2720000	2726880	and similarly there's an isomorphism between su2 and the unit quaternions and by the way this
2726880	2732800	isomorphism makes manifest the hyperspherical topology of su2 so anyway whenever you hear people
2732800	2738320	talking about a rotation algorithm that uses su2 or spinners or quaternions it's all the same
2739040	2743280	the basic idea is that you're doing your rotational math in this weird simply connected
2743280	2748080	hyperspherical kind of redundant group that somehow lives like kind of underneath the vector
2748080	2754560	rotations it's uh it's very bizarre but it works somehow it works and so su2 is actually used
2754560	2760320	ubiquitously in applications that demand maximum performance and so su2 is more than just some
2760320	2765280	fanciful abstraction it's actually very practical and you know it'd be one thing if it were just
2765280	2770400	practical it'd be one thing if su2 was just like a more efficient way to do rotations and you just
2770400	2775760	ignore the spinner phase fine i mean okay that's cool but that's not particularly profound but
2775840	2780080	the thing that's really a trip is that in theoretical physics the spinner phase actually
2780080	2786320	matters so su2 is not just another way of doing rotations but that redundancy that you wash out
2786320	2790960	if you're just doing like video game graphics that actually is something that's relevant to the
2790960	2795920	wave function of a relativistic electron for example and as we'll see later in the video
2795920	2802240	that is a very very deep mystery as to why that's the case okay so let's look at one more double
2802240	2808240	cover animation and then we'll talk about the physical mystery of spinners so here we have a
2808240	2816160	very very complicated rotational path and it's all like and it's all like swooping around and doing
2816160	2822080	all these moves and the point i want to illustrate here is that even when the rotational path is
2822080	2828960	super complicated there's still this connection between the flag rotating an so3 and the spinner
2828960	2834480	rotating with an su2 matrix there's still that two to one connection such that if we go around
2834480	2839360	a class one curve we end up with the phase switched then if we run that class one curve again
2839360	2842800	bring it full circle we end up doing a class two and we end up back to where we started
2843600	2849760	so let's take a closer look at this and we can see exactly how that happens okay so first it comes
2849760	2855200	in it's like shoo shoo and then look it's about to teleport right there do you see that okay cool
2855280	2861280	let's keep it going now it comes around and look we'll pause here okay now it's come back to where
2861280	2866080	it started but the phase is reversed as indicated by the fact that the flag is red and also if you
2866080	2870240	look at the plot you can see that the spinner is the negative of what we started out with
2871200	2875760	all right and continuing it's going to swoop around and it's going to teleport right now
2876640	2880800	and it's going to come back through and it'll end up back where it started so we've done two
2880800	2886160	class ones and that's a class two and that brings us back to the starting point isn't this neat I
2886160	2892960	think it's neat the thing I really want to impress upon you is that su2 double covers s03 and it's
2892960	2898560	like a perfect double cover it's like a hand in the glove or like I guess a hand in two gloves you
2898560	2904080	know so like that's really cool you know like what what does that mean right I mean the algebra I
2904080	2907600	think as you can see the algebra is formally understood I mean look at all the numbers on the
2907600	2911840	screen if you pause it at any moment in time you can check for yourself the matrices are right
2911840	2918400	and you know all the equations we've looked at that's all true it's all good but why like what
2918400	2924160	does this mean you know the funny thing is when making these videos the equations are the easy
2924160	2930160	part because an equation is just a recipe and I can put it in the computer and make an animation
2930160	2935920	and I can just tell you how it is and how it works the hard part is conveying the sense of mystery
2936560	2940640	I mean aside from the fact that it's just kind of confusing and like whoa what are these things
2940640	2945520	but how can I share with you that sense of awe and wonder that so many people have when they work
2945520	2950000	with spinners especially in the context of physics and you know that's much more of a storytelling
2950000	2955600	problem that's the objective there is to really share a state of mind or an attitude and so I
2955600	2959600	just want to tell you about it from my point of view so please take everything I'm about to say
2959600	2964160	with a grain of salt this is just my perspective but I hope it resonates with you as well
2965920	2972000	okay so you might have heard of the five stages of grief well I like to think that there's a
2972000	2978320	similar five stages that you go through when learning about spinners uh hear me out so except
2978320	2984720	it's not as bad instead of anger it's astonishment and instead of depression it's existential shock
2986080	2990800	now I don't think anyone's ever gotten to the fifth stage but I can tell you about the first four
2991520	2996240	so starting off with the denial stage if you tell someone that there's something that you have to
2996240	3000800	rotate it twice to get back to where it started they're just gonna tell you no you're wrong like
3000800	3005600	that can't be like have you ever rotated an object everyone knows all you need is to do a 360
3005600	3010320	rotation in any axis and then you get back to where you started this is like a basic fact of
3010320	3016480	reality and look I get it I mean I understand I've rotated objects too I've actually personally
3016480	3021360	rotated back in the days when I used to jump out of planes I spent a lot of time rotating
3021360	3026720	atmospherically so I'm not naive when it comes to rotations I've been around a time or two
3027680	3032080	sorry I couldn't resist the pun anyway if there's one thing that I know and you know and everyone
3032080	3037440	knows it's that a rotation of 360 degrees is all you need to get back to where you started
3037440	3042160	you don't need a 720 rotation so what is this spinner stuff it makes no sense so that's the
3042240	3048080	denial stage and what breaks you out of the denial stage is when you become really familiar with
3048080	3055200	the math so when you get to know so3 and su2 and you see that su2 double covers so3 you see that
3055200	3061280	so3 is not simply connected but su2 is and so now you have two different ways of looking at rotations
3061280	3065440	and one of them is kind of more elegant but in some sense more redundant than the other and it's
3065440	3070480	sort of like okay there's something here now when you become familiar with the math it's very
3070480	3076640	astonishing so I like to call this the astonishment phase and this is when you might be very curious
3076640	3080800	about the math and you might study it a lot more you might explore it you might write some Python
3080800	3085680	codes you might investigate every which way you can rotate these different things and you might make
3085680	3091040	pretty plots and it's very wonderful and beautiful and you find that there's a very rich structure
3091040	3096080	here that you can spend a lot of time exploring and after having done that there's no way that you
3096080	3102560	can go back to the denial stage but even still you feel the need to contextualize the math you feel
3102560	3107520	the need to say okay but what does it all mean and how literally should I take it and what are the
3107520	3113680	physical implications if any and the part of you in your heart is not going to want there to be any
3113680	3118560	physical implications I mean you want to think it's just the product of a mathematician's overactive
3118560	3122480	imagination you don't want to think there's anything in the world that actually does have
3122480	3127440	to rotate twice to get back to where it started because that's deeply unsettling and so we enter
3127440	3132800	into the bargaining stage where we say okay fine mathematically sure yeah spinners are a thing but
3132800	3138800	it's not physics this isn't real this isn't like tangible and so you can sort of argue the math
3138800	3143360	and physics and say no it's just a useful fiction it's just the structure of the equations but it
3143360	3148880	doesn't have any physical implications and the problem is that is a losing battle because the
3148880	3154480	more you learn physics the more prominent and essential spinners become you know for example
3154480	3158960	look at the Dirac equation look at the wave function of an electron it's a bi-spinner field
3158960	3164160	and it's this thing that's written in terms of spinners and it's at the heart of quantum physics
3165120	3169440	so okay but you still want to bargain some more you still want to say well our understanding of
3169440	3174320	physics is incomplete and so the Dirac equation maybe there's a way of writing it without spinners
3174960	3178800	so you look into geometric algebra and these different ways of writing the Dirac equation
3178800	3183600	and you find that nope no matter what you always have spinners or something equivalent to spinners
3184160	3188480	and so then you say okay but maybe the Dirac equation itself is wrong in some sense and then
3188480	3193600	so okay it's like what is the Dirac equation well it's three ingredients it's Lorenz invariance
3193600	3197760	it's the quantum mechanical energy momentum operators and it's the requirement that the
3197760	3203120	equations be first order in space and time now to the first one of those things no one has ever
3203120	3209280	observed a violation of Lorenz invariance and in my opinion in my lifetime probably no one ever will
3209280	3214000	now do i think that Lorenz invariance is literally true at every scale no personally i don't but
3214000	3218880	i also don't think we're ever gonna be observing any deviations from it anytime soon so if you want
3218880	3223600	to try to undermine the importance of spinners in physics by arguing against Lorenz invariance
3223600	3228320	it's not gonna work out likewise with the quantum mechanical energy momentum operators
3228320	3232800	i mean there's really not much room for flexibility here because they describe so
3232800	3236560	well pretty much like everything i mean you want to look at the black body spectrum you want to
3236560	3241440	look at like the hydrogen energy levels so you're not going to be doing away with the quantum
3241440	3246000	mechanical energy momentum operators but if you look at the third ingredient the fact that the
3246000	3251520	equations have to be first order in space and time here we do have a little bit of leeway because
3251520	3256480	with the benefit of historical hindsight we can say that dirac was a little bit misguided
3256480	3261360	in his original approach you know i think it's fair to say that he was right but perhaps for
3261360	3267440	the wrong reasons or maybe better for reasons that were not fully appreciated or understood at the
3267440	3272400	time anyway with the development of quantum field theory we now know that you can have
3272400	3277280	particles that aren't fermions and so there's no reason for us to think that the electron
3277280	3282080	must be a fermion it just so happens that they are and it just so happens that the way to write
3282080	3285520	that wave function is to say that it's a first order equation in space and time take the square
3285600	3290560	to the mashel spinners pop out you know that whole thing so it's right but it's not obvious that
3290560	3297200	it's like mathematically necessary for an electron to be a fermion aha so the way we're going to
3297200	3303200	bargain out of having to deal with spinners is to say that the electron is not actually a fermion
3303200	3307600	instead we can just choose to model it as a spinless particle right so instead of a bi-spinner
3307600	3312160	field we could just use a complex scalar field for its wave function sort of like schrodinger or
3312160	3318000	Klein-Gordon and there are kind of ways to do that if you're dealing with one electron and are okay
3318000	3322800	making an approximation but the problem is if you take that approach while you're trying to deal
3322800	3328080	with multi-electron systems like if we're doing quantum chemistry or condensed matter physics
3328080	3332400	then that approach doesn't work because we get slapped in the face with something called the
3332400	3337440	spin statistics theorem and it's such a hard slap that we get knocked out of the bargaining phase
3337440	3343680	and into the existential shock phase the spin statistics theorem deserves its own video and
3343680	3348720	actually for now i'll just say there's an excellent book written on it called poly and the spin
3348720	3355600	statistics theorem by ian duck and ecg sudarshan it's a very interesting book and i highly recommend
3355600	3360000	it if you want a good overview of the history of this theorem and its profound implications
3360000	3364800	and what is known about it and what is still not known about it but anyway for today we just have
3364880	3370960	to know what the theorem says in a nutshell it says that particles with half integer spin are
3370960	3376800	fermions and their wave function will pick up a minus sign when two particles are exchanged
3378080	3380720	and that leads into fermi dirac statistics
3383760	3390160	on the other hand particles with integer spin are bosons and their wave function will remain the
3390160	3397360	same when two particles are exchanged that leads into bows einstein statistics in short the spin
3397360	3402960	statistics theorem says that there is a direct and mysterious link between the minus sign or lack
3402960	3410480	thereof picked up by a particle under 360 degree rotation and the minus sign or lack thereof picked
3410480	3416320	up by a multi particle wave function under the exchange of any two particles this fact is going
3416400	3421600	to lead to radically different behavior depending on whether you're dealing with an ensemble of
3421600	3428240	fermions or an ensemble of bosons bosons don't mind being all up in the same quantum state at the
3428240	3435360	same time it's all good but fermions will never share the same quantum state they do not like to
3435360	3441840	be together there's a principle that every high school chemistry student learns called the poly
3441920	3448000	exclusion principle it says that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state at the same time
3448720	3454880	this is a profound principle with far-reaching consequences it plays an absolutely fundamental
3454880	3460160	role in chemistry it's the reason for example that atoms have different orbitals that the electrons
3460160	3464320	have to stay in you know because you might wonder why isn't it that uh an atom at rest why can't
3464320	3468480	all the electrons collapse into the ground state together what is it that keeps some of them propped
3468480	3473120	up into higher energy states well it's the poly exclusion principle you know the lower orbitals
3473120	3478480	are already filled up so chemistry students take this for granted as sort of one of the axioms of
3478480	3484320	chemistry but with physics we go a bit deeper and right now we're actually logically one level
3484320	3490400	underneath the poly exclusion principle because it follows as a consequence of the more fundamental
3490400	3497840	spin statistics theorem to see this just consider a system of n electrons whose multi particle wave
3497840	3505600	function can be written as psi is a function of x1 x2 dot dot dot xa dot dot xb dot dot dot xn
3506320	3511280	where x sub n in this context refers to all the quantum numbers of the nth particle
3511280	3518800	including spatial coordinates and spin now suppose we switch electrons a and b according to the spin
3518800	3524960	statistics theorem because electrons are fermions the new wave function is just the minus sign of
3524960	3530400	the original one so psi of the original quantum numbers is going to equal negative psi of the
3530400	3536000	same quantum numbers but with the numbers for a and b switched around so all we've done so far is
3536000	3541280	basically just stated generically what the spin statistics theorem tells us about fermions but
3541280	3547280	suppose now that we force electrons a and b into the same quantum state with the power of imagination
3548000	3553520	then by the symmetry of what it means for two things to be the same we conclude that there is no
3553520	3558880	difference between the original and swapped wave function by definition there can't be if a and
3558880	3563600	b are the same state then you switch them nothing can change right because they're the same well
3563600	3569200	now here we have two apparently contradictory things when particles a and b are exchanged
3569200	3574640	the wave function both does and doesn't pick up a minus sign how can that possibly be because
3574640	3580160	we're saying that psi has to equal negative psi well that can only be the case if psi is precisely
3580160	3586480	zero and because psi is a probability amplitude we conclude that it is absolutely impossible
3586480	3592160	for two fermions to occupy the same quantum state at the same time there is zero probability of that
3592160	3600000	happening and that is the poly exclusion principle notice that this argument does not apply to bosons
3600000	3605040	with bosons there's no minus sign picked up under particle exchange and so there's no logical
3605040	3609760	tension when you put two particles in the same state switch the identical particles around all
3609760	3614560	you want it's all good and that's why the poly exclusion principle does not apply to photons
3614560	3619840	for example photons or bosons and they can share the same quantum state no problem and in fact they
3619840	3625520	often prefer to do so you can see that the spin statistics theorem is quite profound and plays a
3625520	3631040	major role in shaping the world all around us but why is it true where does this all important
3631040	3637120	principle come from well we know that the spin statistics theorem is true every moment is bursting
3637120	3642480	with an abundance of empirical evidence supporting the theorem as electron orbitals continue to exist
3642480	3648480	and photons continue to be able to occupy the same state additionally the theorem follows logically
3648480	3653360	from the assumptions of quantum field theory and it's been proven rigorously in that context
3653920	3660080	but despite all that nobody really understands in a geometric or visual way why there is this
3660080	3665840	mysterious connection between spin and particle exchange if you think you do understand it because
3665840	3671520	you've seen Feynman's topological argument or some similar intuitive proof read chapter 20 of the
3671520	3677120	spin statistics book long story short those so-called proofs are actually analogies without
3677120	3683200	any explanatory power but they are fun to think about okay fine now there is one last battle
3683200	3688080	where we try to work our way back into the bargaining phase and that is to say well maybe the spin
3688080	3693200	statistics theorem is not actually logically underneath the poly exclusion principle maybe
3693200	3698160	it's just some kind of cosmic coincidence so maybe spin doesn't play a fundamentally
3698160	3703440	consequential role in the spin statistics theorem but instead maybe it just so happens to be that
3703440	3708000	the particles in our universe that happen to be fermions happen to obey the poly exclusion principle
3708000	3713360	whereas bosons do not now this is unlikely but we're really grasping at straws here to try to
3713360	3718320	retain some semblance of our natural intuition you know we don't want to feel like the world is
3718320	3724480	much more bizarre than it seems but but it is but anyway the final nail in the coffin is to say okay
3724480	3731600	look what if we take an electron and we change its spin so that it no longer is a half integer kind
3731600	3738160	of thing but actually behaves as a boson then if that electron is set free of the poly exclusion
3738160	3743600	principle we would know that we actually are logically underneath the poly exclusion principle
3743600	3748800	right now because that experiment would give us a definitive proof that the poly exclusion
3748800	3754080	principle actually does arise from the spin statistics theorem in a really meaningful way
3755680	3761920	now it's actually not super easy to convert electrons into bosons but it can be done in
3761920	3767120	some materials because of the way electrons mutually interact with the crystal lattice
3767120	3772720	you can occasionally get a spin up electron pairing up with a spin down electron and that pair of
3772720	3780480	electrons has a net spin of zero and so the pair of electrons is collectively a bosonic entity
3781360	3787680	so in the material you can have a great many of these and they're able to condense into something
3787680	3793440	that's spiritually very similar to a boson stein condensate and they genuinely are occupying the
3793440	3798240	same state at the same time which electrons hardly ever do but when you convert them to bosons all
3798240	3802560	we're doing is modifying their spin we're not changing their charge we're not taking away any
3802560	3807600	mass or any of that we're just pairing them up so the spin cancels out and now we set them free
3807600	3812640	from the poly exclusion principle they condense into a very low energy state and can slip through a
3812640	3818240	material like a ghost without interacting with the atoms along the way and this is the phenomenon
3818240	3824160	of superconductivity and so superconductivity gives us an undeniable proof that the spin
3824240	3829440	statistics theorem is genuinely underneath the poly exclusion principle by the way we'll have a
3829440	3834720	lot more to say in the future about superconductivity it is an incredible phenomenon and you know i've
3834720	3840800	personally seen what a superconductor can do my colleagues and i have sent enormous electrical
3840800	3846560	currents through superconductors many thousands of times the intensity that would melt copper
3847440	3852640	and i've watched it stay cool as a cucumber it doesn't heat up at all because all that current
3852640	3857280	is being carried by these superelectrons that are behaving as bosons and so it's not even like
3857280	3862320	regular physics like we know and love it it's like this weird surreal like crazy version of
3862320	3866480	reality where the poly exclusion principle only you know doesn't always apply to every electron
3866480	3869520	i think it's amazing it's a wonderful thing so we'll talk about that a lot in the future we'll
3869520	3874160	get into uh ginsberg landau and flux quantization and all that good stuff but anyway today i just
3874160	3879920	bring it up to highlight that this whole spinner thing you know it's real it's mysterious and if
3879920	3884720	you take away the spinner nature of the electrons wave function you get some pretty bizarre and
3884720	3890080	surreal effects that actually are real this is not just theory this is not just socrates
3890080	3895520	philosophies and hypotheses no this is like real like technology like engineering people are building
3895520	3902160	devices with this stuff so you know so that's something to think about anyway is it possible
3902160	3907520	to reach the acceptance stage and to really understand spinners in a way that would satisfy
3907520	3914800	even michael atia maybe but we're not there yet among other things the lack of an intuitive but
3914800	3920800	rigorous proof of the spin statistics theorem shows that we don't fully understand the significance
3920800	3926240	of spinners in physical reality we're aware of spinners we're able to work with them we know
3926240	3931680	how their algebra works but we still do not know why spinner valued wave functions are anti symmetric
3931680	3936560	under particle exchange now you might be thinking rich come on now you're just dramatizing your
3936560	3940800	own ignorance this isn't actually a mystery you just don't know the answer well it's true that I
3940800	3945440	don't know the answer but i'm not the only one who thinks that this is a mystery let me share with
3945440	3950960	you this quote from the spin statistics book this quote is in a passage about whether or not physics
3950960	3955520	can explain the spin statistics theorem or is just consistent with spin statistics
3957520	3963760	we should modify the meaning of understand and at the same time reduce our expectations of any
3963760	3971680	proof of the spin statistics theorem what is proved whether truly or not whether optimally or not
3972400	3979120	in an acceptable logical sequence or not is that the existing theory is consistent with the spin
3979120	3985760	statistics relation what is not demonstrated is a reason for the spin statistics relation
3987040	3991920	to belabor the point it is difficult to imagine a fundamental mechanism for the
3991920	3998640	poly exclusion principle upon which all depends which predicates it upon the analyticity properties
3998640	4006080	of vacuum expectation values of products of quantized field operators did god for lack of a
4006080	4013200	better word build a series of failed worlds which sputtered and died or exploded and disintegrated
4013760	4018720	before discovering the stabilizing effect of anti commutation relations for half integral spin fields
4019680	4022880	was this before or after imposing the requirements of Lorenz invariance
4023760	4027680	are we the lucky winners of a Monte Carlo simulation in which every choice was tried
4028320	4034320	and one survived must we reduce our demands on physics to require only consistency
4035280	4039920	does an understanding of the why of the spin statistics relation have no direct answer in
4039920	4047520	physics or must physics be formulated to include it the poly result does not explain the spin
4047520	4052320	statistics relation and cannot the noix wanders and the Feynman's of the world
4052320	4057360	must remain unsatisfied because the consistency of relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum
4057360	4062400	field theory with the poly exclusion principle has every reason to be as complicated as these
4062400	4068320	subjects are not as simple and direct as the poly exclusion principle itself
4070800	4075440	so in short there there sure is a lot of mystery here and it's confusing but it's kind of cool
4075440	4081040	to think about right but you know honestly i can only think about spinners for so long
4081040	4086640	before it starts to hurt it's like diving underwater you try to go as deep as you can but
4086640	4091520	at some point you have to come back up for air and it's all so disorienting that sometimes
4091520	4095520	when you stop thinking about spinners it's all so confusing and you feel like you're right back
4095520	4102240	to square one but my friends if there's one thing that spinners have taught us it's that just
4102240	4107040	because you returned to where you started doesn't mean you haven't picked something up along the way
4108880	4113040	so in that spirit i'd like to reiterate part of the quote from the beginning of the video
4114320	4118800	no one fully understands spinners their algebra is formally understood
4119520	4125280	but their general significance is mysterious i hope today i've given you some sense of the
4125280	4128720	algebra but most importantly an appreciation of the mystery
