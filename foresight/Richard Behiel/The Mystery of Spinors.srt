00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
Hey y'all, today we'll be talking about spinners. These things are really cool. Once you learn

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,540
about spinners, your life will never be the same. You'll develop a lingering, justified

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:20,180
suspicion that this world is not as it seems. And you might also develop a lifelong addiction

4
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,600
to physics. So, you've been warned.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,040
To set the tone, I'd like to start off with a quote by the renowned mathematician, fields

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:35,400
metallist and knight, Sir Michael Atia. No one fully understands spinners. Their algebra

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,640
is formally understood, but their general significance is mysterious. In some sense,

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,160
they describe the square root of geometry, and just as understanding the square root

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,560
of negative one took centuries, the same might be true of spinners. Michael was an extraordinary

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,600
mathematician, and if he of all people says that no one fully understands spinners, then

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,440
it's okay if we're a little confused when we first learn about spinners. Spinners are

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,040
confusing, frankly they're disorienting, and not particularly intuitive. You know, if you tell

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,960
someone there's a thing that you have to rotate twice to get back to where it started, they might

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,240
think you're a little insane. But really, the insane thing is that spinners are not insane.

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,520
They're mathematically coherent, they show up in our most fundamental laws of physics,

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,000
and they refuse to go away. Spinners are really at the core of fundamental physics. I mean,

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,480
look at the way function of an electron, for example, or any fermion for that matter. If not

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,720
for spinners, we wouldn't have the poly exclusion principle, and so we wouldn't have chemistry.

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,640
Matter would collapse, and the world would be a very boring place. So there's no way of restructuring

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,040
physics in a way that you don't have spinners, and therefore these strange weird little mathematical

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,760
objects we do actually have to deal with, and we have to work with, and we have to understand,

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,200
where does this come from, what does it mean, why do these things exist, and it's really mysterious.

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,760
Okay, but what is a spinner? Hmm. Well, in the last few videos, we've been developing some of the

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,760
basics of relativistic quantum physics. We've looked at Klein-Gordon, we've looked at the

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,840
Dirac equation, we've looked at an example of Dirac equation for the eigenstate of a particle

26
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,120
at rest, and while we've done that, we've seen that spinners have emerged as the sort of two

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,960
component complex numbers. But today, I don't just want to define spinners as a pair of complex

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,560
numbers, because that's not particularly geometrically insightful. Instead, I want to show you an

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,200
argument for why we should expect something like spinners to exist in the first place,

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,560
and we'll do that by exploring a very subtle thing about the way objects rotate in three dimensions.

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,360
That'll open up a crack in reality that we can use to smuggle spinners into our imagination.

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,840
Then after that, we can explore the algebraic properties of spinners, we can see where the

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,680
complex numbers come in, we can see how we can draw spinners as flags, we can look at how they

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,000
transform under rotations, and finally, we'll tie it all back into the Dirac equation and we'll

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,880
talk about how this relates to electrons. This video will hopefully answer many questions,

36
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,600
and it'll surely raise many more. Spinners are one of those things where the more you

37
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,400
learn about them, the more wonderful and magical they become.

38
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,720
Before we talk about rotations, there are a few vocabulary words that we need to borrow from

39
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:24,320
topology. These are homotopic, simply connected, and homotopy class. So imagine we have a whiteboard,

40
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,880
and we've drawn a squiggly loop. The loop is alive and sentient and is feeling its way around

41
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:37,280
the whiteboard. As it goes along, in each moment it takes on a different shape, but it doesn't

42
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,240
break apart. It can stretch and shrink, but it can't be cut, and from one moment to the next,

43
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,240
its topology stays the same. The fancy way to say this is that it's evolving into different

44
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:57,520
loops that are all homotopic. Homo is in same, and topic is in topology, so homotopic means

45
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,600
that they have the same topology. Oh, whoa, little guy's getting nervous. Eh, that's okay.

46
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,120
Stage fright, you know, it's understandable. Oh, there it goes, shrinking down to a point.

47
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,760
It's a defense mechanism. That's fine, you know, I'm a bit shy myself, so who am I to judge?

48
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,880
Anyway, the reason our loop was able to shrink like that is that there wasn't an obstacle,

49
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,480
or a hole, or something weird that got in its way. Instead, it just had a nice, smooth,

50
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:31,120
simple space, so it was able to shrink on down to a point. And that is our next vocabulary word,

51
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,000
simply connected. A space is simply connected if all the loops that live in the space

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,120
can shrink down to a point whenever they want to. But now what if we take our whiteboard

53
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,920
and we drill a hole in the middle? So now as the loop explores its environment,

54
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,320
it goes around and it realizes that it can't go into the hole and it can't escape the board,

55
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,400
but it can still shrink if it wants to, so no problems there. But now consider this little guy,

56
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,480
which was born into quite a predicament. It's wrapped all the way around the hole,

57
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,840
so it can't shrink down to a point. When it's feeling shy, at best it can only become a small

58
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,160
circle, not a point. So that tells us that this space, whiteboard with a hole in it,

59
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,120
is not simply connected. So now think about this, the loop on the left can evolve into a variety

60
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,160
of different shapes that are all homotopic to each other. All the different forms that it can

61
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,400
take on are all a loop that lives between the hole and the edge of the whiteboard. Likewise,

62
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,640
the loop on the right can also evolve into many different homotopic shapes,

63
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,520
but those are all wrapped around the hole. And so you see here we have two different

64
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,280
homotopic classes, class in the sense of like a set of entities that all have something in common.

65
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,200
So we can say that the loops fall into different classes depending on whether or not they wrap

66
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,320
around the hole. And actually it's a bit more complicated than that because in this case you

67
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,440
could also have loops that wrap around the hole multiple times. And so we actually have a different

68
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,640
homotopic class for each number of times it wraps around. And so the winding number matters,

69
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,040
the number of times that the curve is wound around the hole that matters. But those are all

70
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,320
the homotopic classes of loops on the whiteboard. You can organize them just by specifying the so

71
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,280
called winding number. And a curve that has a certain winding number cannot be continuously

72
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,000
deformed into having a different winding number. So you can stretch them and shrink them but you

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,320
can't change the winding number unless you cut the loop which is not allowed. This hurts the loop.

74
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,440
Do not hurt the loop. Okay. Oh by the way in this context the loop can pass through itself so we

75
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,360
don't have to worry about the loop getting tangled up in knots and what are the different kinds of

76
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,840
knots and all that. No no it doesn't matter. The purpose of these loops are not to model like

77
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,960
physical rubber bands but just to tell us something about the nature of the space in which they live.

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,840
Oh one more thing on this topic. Imagine we repair the whiteboard so there's no more hole.

79
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,160
But now it has the magical property that the left and right edges of the board

80
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,600
are identified with each other such that the loop can appear to teleport from one side to the other.

81
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,640
So there's no longer a hole in the board but there is this weird teleporting situation.

82
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,840
So now is this space simply connected? To address that question we have to think about

83
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,560
what it means for the curve to teleport like this from one side to the other without breaking.

84
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,160
That means that each point on the left side of the board and the opposite point on the right side

85
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,320
of the board must be literally the same point. So we realize that this space is actually the

86
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,400
surface of a cylinder without the top and bottom circles. And so from that point of view no the

87
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,160
space is not simply connected because in addition to loops that can shrink to a point we also have

88
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,440
the possibility of loops that wrap around the cylinder and those cannot shrink to a point.

89
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,040
Now when we look at those loops on the whiteboard they look like weird teleporting lines not loops.

90
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,160
But when we're looking at the three-dimensional view that really shows the nature of the space

91
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,040
without any cuts and teleports but we see the real space the real for real like how it actually is

92
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,600
then we can see that indeed this is a loop and it cannot be shrunk to a point. By the way here

93
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,320
again it's the same exact situation as before where we can also have different winding numbers

94
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,320
and it turns out that all the homotopy classes of loops on a cylinder can be organized simply by

95
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:35,200
their winding number. It's not a coincidence that the hole in the whiteboard and the cylinder have

96
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,480
the same set of homotopy classes because if you think about it a whiteboard with a hole in it well

97
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,160
that's a cd and a cd is a lamp shade and a lamp shade is a cylinder so therefore whiteboard with

98
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,760
a hole in it is a cylinder. I love topology. You know the difference between geometry and

99
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,920
topology. In geometry you take your ruler and your protractor and you draw lines and angles and shapes.

100
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,880
In topology you take your ruler and your protractor and you throw them out the window.

101
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay so now we know about homotopy simply connected and homotopy class. We also know

102
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,600
that if a space seems like it has teleports from one side to the other this might actually be a

103
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,280
totally continuous space with no teleports but embedded in a higher dimension such that you can

104
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,400
actually pull those points together. Now we're going to apply these concepts to the group of

105
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,240
rotations in three dimensions but first we have to specify what even is the group of rotations in

106
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,360
three dimensions. Let's say we have a cube and let's go ahead and stick a flag in it to make

107
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,120
it really easy to see how the cube is oriented. Now let me ask you this if we rotate this cube

108
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,960
what are all the different ways it can be oriented and how can we represent that set

109
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,600
of all possible orientations? Well there's a couple different ways of going about this and

110
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,960
they're all basically the same but probably the easiest way is to notice that every orientation

111
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:07,760
can be defined with some axis of rotation and some amount of rotation around that axis and this is

112
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,160
known as the axis angle representation. So what this means is that let's say we have some reference

113
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,400
flag that's say pointing up and in a certain direction then we can get to any other flag

114
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,760
orientation just by rotating the reference flag some amount around some axis. This fact is not

115
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,520
obvious but it is true it follows as a direct consequence of Euler's rotation theorem.

116
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,640
Okay now let's introduce the concept of an axis angle rotation vector so what this vector is

117
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:50,720
it points in the direction of the axis of rotation and its length is the amount of rotation so here

118
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,400
I'm showing a cube rotating around a single axis and you can see that as the vector grows and shrinks

119
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,560
the cube is rotated more or less around that axis and so if you think about it what is the

120
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,200
space of rotations in three dimensions? If you wanted to categorize everything how can we possibly

121
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,080
come up with some kind of space that encodes every which way a thing can be oriented?

122
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,600
Well it's the space of all directions multiplied by the space of all lengths

123
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,440
but it's a little bit tricky because it's not really the space of all lengths you know if you

124
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,120
rotate 180 degrees around some axis that's the same as rotating 180 around the opposite axis

125
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,440
so actually what you want to imagine is like a sphere where if the vector pokes through the

126
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,880
sphere by the way the sphere has radius of 180 degrees or pi if you want but when it goes

127
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,360
through the sphere then it ends up teleporting to the exact opposite side of the sphere

128
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,400
and it ends up coming back in if you keep rotating it see because what happens here and here we'll

129
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,680
just go along a single axis to make it easy to see but as the vector grows and grows the thing

130
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,680
rotates it gets to 180 and at that point we're going to map its rotation vector onto the opposite

131
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,320
axis 180 and then we're going to keep rotating and that's going to keep coming in and coming in

132
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,200
which is like a lesser and lesser rotation around that opposite axis until finally it ends up back

133
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,600
where it started and so in summary the space of all possible rotations in three dimensions

134
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,040
can be represented as a ball a ball meaning a sphere and also the volume contained within it

135
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,760
of radius 180 degrees where every point on the spherical boundary of the ball is identified with

136
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,520
the exact opposite point such that if you go outside of the sphere you seem to get teleported

137
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,840
back through the other side of the sphere but remember this is not actually a teleport there's

138
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:45,280
not actually anything discontinuous happening here this apparent teleport is just an artifact of the

139
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,880
way we're drawing this space in reality the space of rotations in three dimensions ironically doesn't

140
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,560
really fit in three dimensions and that's not that weird because if you think about it what we

141
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,240
have here is an abstract space that represents every possible kind of rotation so that's a different

142
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,360
kind of thing than the space that we're rotating within so it's actually not that weird that this

143
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,560
space ends up having this kind of topologically interesting character but a lot of weird things

144
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,440
follow as a consequence of that as we're about to see what i want to show you now is that there

145
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,840
are different kinds of ways to rotate an object back to its original orientation and that seems

146
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,800
weird because you'd think any way you rotate an object back to itself it should all be the same

147
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,520
right there shouldn't really be a meaningful distinction between how you go about doing that

148
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,760
but that's not actually the case so first let's recognize that if we rotate an object back to

149
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,440
its original orientation what that means in our axis angle space is that we're starting with the

150
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,640
zero vector at the origin meaning no rotation then the vector is going to go out and grow in

151
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,920
some direction and it can move around and in general it can do whatever it wants to do it can

152
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,800
teleport if it goes more than 180 whatever the case may be but in order to return to the original

153
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,840
orientation it has to come back to the zero vector so the space of all possible ways to orient an

154
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:14,240
object back to itself is exactly the space of all possible closed loops in this axis angle

155
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,240
representation there is one caveat here which is that when we look at loops in the axis angle

156
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,160
representation we should think of it only as going around the loop once for reasons that we'll see

157
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,320
in a moment and so what we're gonna do actually tell you what we're gonna take a circular cross

158
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,640
section so not the full three-dimensional ball but actually just a two-dimensional disc now this is

159
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,520
just a slice it's just a cross section but it's easier to look at than the full three-dimensional

160
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,560
thing and what i want to show you about there being different ways of rotating things all of that we

161
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,320
can see by examining this cross section and then we'll see that the same exact concepts easily

162
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,120
generalize into the full three-dimensional space now when we look at these loops i'm also going to

163
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,720
use a color map that winds around the rainbow and then comes back to the starting color and what

164
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,680
that's going to do is that's going to highlight for us the continuity of the loop and in a similar

165
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,880
spirit i'm also going to put a little dot on the loop that just goes around and around and so when

166
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,680
we're looking at teleports the ball is going to help us visualize which parts of the curve are

167
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,160
connected to which other parts of the curve but remember each of these loops only corresponds

168
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,080
to rotating an object once around this particular loop okay and that's important because as we'll

169
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,400
see there's a difference between going around once or twice or three times or four times and so

170
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,800
there are some subtleties there so in our diagram whenever we have a loop think about it as that

171
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,360
represents rotating the object one time around this path in the space of rotations

172
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,920
all right well with all that said let's go ahead and start to explore some of the different

173
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:57,280
kinds of loops we have in this axis angle space the first kind of loop that we'll look at is

174
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,040
maybe the simplest kind it's just a small loop that stays totally within the boundaries of the

175
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,680
diagram and this corresponds to a wiggle where the cube never rotates more than 180 degrees around

176
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,400
any axis it just sort of wiggles around for a bit and then returns to where it started

177
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,480
as you can imagine this loop is homotopic to any other wiggle that stays within the

178
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,560
boundary and passes through the origin because you can always just imagine stretching it and

179
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,480
shrinking it and exploring the entire homotopy class of wiggles and again these loops can pass

180
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,920
through themselves so we don't have to worry about the question of knots and the different

181
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,560
kinds of knots so aside from wiggles what other homotopy classes might there be well consider

182
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:47,360
a cube that rotates once along some axis so it does a full 360 that means that its loop is going

183
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,520
to start at the origin and then it's going to go out to 180 degrees then it'll come back in

184
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:59,760
along the opposite axis and finally it'll return to the origin again having completed a full 360

185
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,840
degree rotation now that's a rotation right that's not just a wiggle that's a full rotation and by

186
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,240
the way if you look at the loop it might not look like a loop it looks more like a weird teleporting

187
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,240
line but remember the cylinder and remember that the apparent teleportation here is just an artifact

188
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,840
of the way we're drawing the space but it doesn't represent any real discontinuity in the space you

189
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:27,280
have to imagine that the space is curvy in a way that doesn't really fit in the dimensionality

190
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,320
of your screen and so the points that the curve appears to teleport through are actually literally

191
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,560
the same point and in this diagram all pairs of opposite points are literally the same point

192
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,840
now this kind of loop is a genuine rotation i mean look it goes all the way around it's way more

193
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,320
than just a wiggle it's a full 360 and you can see that it can't be reduced to a wiggle because

194
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,440
there's no way of continuously deforming this loop into a loop that doesn't cross the circular

195
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,600
boundary without cutting it okay so then now we have at least two different homotopy classes of

196
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,560
loops in the axis angle space wiggles and full rotations so the space of rotations in three

197
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,840
dimensions is not simply connected which is really surprising right you wouldn't necessarily expect

198
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,880
that but here we can very clearly see that there are at least two totally distinct homotopy classes

199
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,840
of loops in the space of rotations in three dimensions and you know that's just a fundamental

200
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,920
fact of reality all right well this feels similar to the cylinder example where you had loops that

201
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,240
didn't teleport and you also had loops that teleported and then you had like multiple winding

202
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,160
numbers of teleportations and so we might expect to find infinitely many homotopy classes here for

203
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,760
the rotations depending on how many times the loop goes through the boundary but surprisingly

204
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:52,720
that's not the case there are actually only two different homotopy classes consider for example

205
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,120
the fact that a wiggle is homotopic to an octopus that's gotta be a brand new sentence i don't think

206
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,200
anyone's ever said that you're hearing it first here folks freshly minted sentence okay so the

207
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,280
wiggle crosses the boundary zero times but the octopus crosses many times and yet the two are

208
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,120
totally homotopic as you can see as we're going back and forth between these two you see they're

209
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,320
homotopic it's all continuous transformations here there's no cutting so we don't have one

210
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,200
homotopy class for each winding number like we did with the cylinder because now it's a different

211
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,240
kind of teleporting boundary the boundary is round and has a different geometry and so the

212
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,600
loops can slip around and slip through the boundary and what that ends up doing is it means that you

213
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,240
can always add or subtract two boundary crossings by continuously deforming the loop see for another

214
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,200
example let's say we have a rotation that teleports once and by the way each pair of points here

215
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,080
we're counting as one crossing notice they're the same color they're really the same point

216
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,680
it looks like two points on our diagram but that's an artifact of the way we're drawing a diagram

217
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,640
okay so this is one crossing but you can show that this loop is homotopic to a loop that teleports

218
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,280
multiple times but when you do that with this loop because it started off crossing once you can only

219
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,920
ever get to an odd number of crossings and so as it turns out we only have two homotopy classes

220
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,480
and they're based on whether we have an odd number or an even number of teleports

221
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,760
you can see this by noticing that you can always pull part of the loop through the circular boundary

222
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,680
but when you do so you'll always pull two line segments at a time because we're grabbing onto

223
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,480
a closed loop and that's just how it is and by the way you can see that this argument generalizes

224
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,160
not just to the circular cross section but also to the whole spherical situation because it doesn't

225
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,160
matter whether you're pulling a loop through a circular boundary or a spherical boundary

226
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,160
because either way the loop is going to come through two line segments at a time when you

227
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,000
pull on it so this thing about the two homotopy classes even though we've demonstrated that for

228
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,480
this circular cross section it actually does hold true for the entire space of rotations in three

229
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,400
dimensions oh and here let's go ahead and introduce some terminology so we'll say that a loop is

230
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,920
class one if it has an odd number of teleports and we'll say it's class two if it has an even number

231
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,440
this is easy to remember because one is odd and two is even

232
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,160
you know we've now arrived at a checkpoint like in a video game when you get to a certain level

233
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,800
and your progress is saved you'll want to make sure that you're really comfortable with all of

234
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,080
these ideas discussed so far because we're about to get algebraic and it makes all the

235
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,120
difference in the world if you're able to see and to feel in your soul that the rotations in

236
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,360
three dimensions are not simply connected but actually have two different homotopy classes

237
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,120
of loops i really want to emphasize that this is a fundamental insight a pivotal transformation of

238
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,000
your worldview that you have to go through if you want to study spinners you know even though we

239
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,960
haven't used any equations yet there's a lot to think about here and it may take a while to digest

240
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,320
these ideas i know it took me a while so it's worth meditating on these concepts until they become

241
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,680
second nature because seeing that the rotations aren't simply connected but have rather two

242
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,560
homotopy classes is really the difference between your intuition holding you back and pulling you

243
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,960
forward if you get this concept about two homotopy classes if you really feel it then instinctively

244
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,600
you'll suspect that maybe there might be some mathematical object that is sensitive to the

245
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,280
class of rotations and so it would necessarily have to double cover the space of rotations

246
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,840
and it might not exactly return to itself after a single rotation but instead might pick up some

247
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,480
phase factor that alternates depending on whether it's a class one or a class two and so if you

248
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,040
really get this then your imagination is going to pull you in the direction of spinners you'll

249
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,440
yearn for them even before you've seen what they are and you'll be prepared and excited when it

250
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:56,960
comes time to actually write an equation all right let's get algebraic so we have this idea

251
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:03,760
of an axis angle representation of a rotation and now the question is how do we actually work

252
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,080
with this what do we do with this let's say we have some rotation vector and we want to say okay

253
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,160
i want to rotate an object in accordance with that axis angle vector what equation do i write

254
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,560
what code do i put in the computer what do i do and i want to tell you about two different

255
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:27,520
ways of rotating an object the vector way and the spinner way so i want to focus on the vector way

256
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,280
first and this involves rotation matrices and then later i'll talk about the spinner way and this

257
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:41,200
involves su2 matrices so starting with the vector way of rotating things um actually you know what

258
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,560
here first we're going to go into two dimensions i'll show you how to rotate vectors i'll show

259
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,520
you the implications for this vis-a-vis rotating objects and then we'll expand up into three

260
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,440
dimensions but i'll use the two dimensions as an example to lay out some of the mathematical

261
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,520
framework all right so imagine we're in a two-dimensional space and we have a unit vector

262
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,960
pointing along the x-axis and you know a unit vector along the x-axis is kind of the simplest

263
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,920
thing you can put in a vector space so we're going to use that as our reference object because

264
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,440
you know no need to over complicate it now in order to rotate this vector what we can do is we

265
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:24,080
can construct something called a rotation matrix in two dimensions the rotation matrix about some

266
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:32,320
counterclockwise angle theta has the form cosine of theta negative sine theta sine of theta cosine

267
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,800
of theta and if you investigate the properties of this matrix you'll find two things first the

268
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,800
inverse of the matrix is the transpose of the matrix so if you transpose the matrix and if you

269
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,360
take the inverse that's the same thing and another way of writing that is that the matrix times the

270
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,200
transpose equals the identity matrix so that's the first thing and that means that the matrix is

271
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,720
orthogonal so in the inverse of a matrix equals its transpose that is an orthogonal matrix and

272
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,800
another thing we can see by inspection is that this matrix has determinant one because you know

273
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,000
cosine squared plus sine squared is one so our matrix is orthogonal and it has determinant one

274
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,520
and so the fancy word for that is it is a special orthogonal matrix in particular it's a special

275
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:26,000
orthogonal two by two matrix and so what we say is it is an s o two matrix so a rotation matrix in

276
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,840
two dimensions is also known as an s o two matrix oh by the way even though we're talking about s o

277
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:39,280
two in terms of matrices the term s o two can also refer to the group of rotations in two dimensions

278
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:45,360
in a more general sense whether or not we use matrices to represent them for example instead

279
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,280
we could represent 2d rotations with unit complex numbers and complex multiplication

280
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,240
because the group of e to the i theta's under complex multiplication is isomorphic to the group

281
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,200
of s o two matrices under matrix multiplication and that's a neat little connection there between

282
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,440
the complex numbers and the s o two matrices we'll see in a moment that there's a similar

283
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,120
connection between the quaternions and vsu two matrices but more on that later but for now i just

284
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,760
wanted to let you know that there are many equivalent ways to reformulate all of these concepts

285
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,440
but i like the matrix representation because it's very mechanical and transparent now if we

286
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:29,040
look at this blue thing swinging around we realize that we can use the set of all rotated blue vectors

287
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:36,960
to visualize the set of all s o two matrices because if we define the unit vector along x

288
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:45,040
as a reference vector then each s o two rotation matrix corresponds to one and only one rotated

289
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:51,520
unit vector so if you tell me hey here's a reference vector and now here's a rotated vector

290
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,880
then by looking at how rotated the rotated vector is i can figure out what s o two matrix was

291
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,080
responsible for the rotation likewise if you give me an s o two matrix and a reference vector

292
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,400
then i can draw you the rotated vector so there's a one-to-one correspondence here

293
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,000
and this is true regardless of what reference vector we pick no matter its length or orientation

294
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,600
which you can prove to yourself by skeptically tilting your head and leaning back

295
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,560
so anyway we can see that we can loop through the s o two matrices in a periodic way passing

296
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,040
through each of them in order of increasing angle and then ending up back where we started

297
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,920
and so we can see that the topology of s o two is just a circle and that's why s o two is also

298
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:40,800
called the circle group so in two dimensions we can represent an s o two matrix in other words

299
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:47,520
a rotation with just a vector but when we go to three dimensions because of the extra degree of

300
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,440
freedom uh we're gonna have to use a flag and the reason we're using a flag is because if you

301
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,480
just had a vector in three dimensions then that kind of points in a certain direction but then

302
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,400
there's the question of how is the vector rotated along its axis and so with a flag we can see that

303
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,600
flag rotation angle and so we can use that to represent the rotations in three dimensions but

304
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,480
before we get into three dimensions i want to show you how to rotate a flag in two dimensions

305
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,240
and basically the way to do it is just imagine the vector that points from the origin to each

306
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,600
of the interesting points on the flag so the zero vector points to the flagpole base then you

307
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,080
have a vector that points to the top of the flagpole a couple of vectors that point out to the sides

308
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,320
of the flag and then another vector that points along the flagpole to the point where the flag

309
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,920
meets the flagpole so basically we just treat those five points as vectors and you apply a

310
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,840
rotation matrix to those vectors and as it turns out the whole pattern of the flag will rotate

311
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,280
when you do this and that's because rotation matrices preserve the relative lengths and

312
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:56,880
angles of vectors that they're transforming and so any lines drawn between two vectors which is

313
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,520
also the difference of those two vectors will transform in the same way as all of the other

314
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:07,680
vectors now here's a view where we offset the flag from the origin so here this really drives

315
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,400
the point home that if you have some shape made out of vectors and you rotate all the vectors

316
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,760
you end up rotating the shape there's a couple of other concepts I wanted to touch on while we're

317
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:24,720
here for example what would happen if we scaled up our rotation matrix so that its determinant

318
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,000
were greater than one well now it would no longer be a special orthogonal matrix but it would still

319
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,280
be a matrix and it would still transform a vector field and as you can see from this animation if

320
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:40,480
we take a rotation matrix and scale it up so that its determinant is greater than one then that's

321
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:46,800
just going to expand all of the vectors likewise if we scale down a rotation matrix so that its

322
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,520
determinant becomes less than one then that's going to shrink the vectors and the reason I

323
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,800
bring this up is so that you can see the connection between a matrix having determinant one and a

324
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,600
matrix doing a rotation transform because with a rotation we don't want to expand or shrink

325
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,760
vectors we want to keep them the same length and by the way when you're transforming a vector space

326
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,600
with a matrix it's not always a uniform expansion or contraction sometimes you can also get a skew

327
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:18,560
and a matrix that skews a vector space is not an orthogonal matrix because it doesn't preserve the

328
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,720
relative lengths and angles of the vector field you know it squishes them and so anyway that's

329
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,080
another reason why we want to use a special orthogonal matrix for rotations because they

330
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,480
don't skew the vector field oh and also if we go ahead and allow the determinant to go negative

331
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,600
you can see that an inversion of the vector field happens and by the way I know this looks

332
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,480
kind of three-dimensional but it's actually two-dimensional and it's getting squished along

333
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,520
one axis until it flips around and goes out on the other axis while at the same time I'm rotating it

334
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,360
but anyway the main thing I wanted to show you there is that an inversion can happen when the

335
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,520
determinant goes negative so I hope these examples of growing and shrinking and skewing and inverting

336
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,680
vectors gives you some sense of why we want to use special orthogonal matrices to do rotations

337
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,240
okay so now that we're experts on SO2 and rotations in two dimensions we'll go ahead and

338
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,720
pop up into the third dimension a lot of what we just talked about in 2d will transfer directly

339
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,120
over to 3d but of course now we're in an expanded environment so some of the concepts will be adjusted

340
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,760
accordingly but something I want to emphasize is that all of this special orthogonal terminology

341
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,440
gives us a precise way to describe what kinds of matrices we're looking for regardless of the

342
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,320
dimensionality of the space that we're in because all of the same intuitions apply in 3d as in 2d

343
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,920
about not wanting to grow the vectors or shrink or skew or invert anything and so what we're

344
00:31:51,920 --> 00:32:00,240
looking for now are SO3 matrices that is special orthogonal 3x3 matrices where the same constraints

345
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,760
apply about the inverse being the transpose and the determinant being 1 but now there's just an

346
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:13,280
additional dimension and so the essence of special orthogonality is the essence of rotation and yes

347
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:19,520
by the way this also applies in higher dimensions but save our tears for another day so anyway

348
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,400
earlier we saw that given some rotation angle theta we can construct the 2d rotation matrix as

349
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:33,360
cosine negative sine sine cosine but now in three dimensions instead of just an angle for the rotation

350
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:39,680
we now have an axis angle vector like we talked about earlier and so we're faced with the question

351
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:47,440
of how do we write the SO3 matrix that goes with any particular axis angle vector this is actually

352
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,760
quite a difficult problem but don't worry it was solved in 1840 by Alinde Rodriguez and the

353
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,000
solution is called the Rodriguez formula the Rodriguez formula is just a recipe for converting

354
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,400
an axis angle vector into the SO3 matrix that does that rotation so you take an axis angle vector

355
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,520
put it into the Rodriguez formula and out pops your SO3 matrix and then you take that SO3 matrix

356
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,760
you just slap it onto a vector and it rotates the vector and that's how that works that's how

357
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,000
you rotate vectors in 3d it's pretty neat so in theory in principle according to everyone's

358
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,080
intuition and imagination that should be good enough if we want to represent rotating any object

359
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,120
you should totally be able to just list out a bunch of position vectors of points on the object

360
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,440
rotate all your position vectors with special orthogonal matrices and then that should be

361
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,440
like all you need to rotate things in math and physics like you should only ever have

362
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,680
special orthogonal matrices for rotations like we have it already it's good enough right this is

363
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:55,440
fine well not exactly we got to talk about SU2 SU2 I don't even know where to begin with SU2

364
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:02,320
well here how about this we'll start off by thinking about SU2 as a complex generalization

365
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:10,320
of SO2 let me clarify what I mean by that so think about an SO2 matrix as we've seen you

366
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,280
can write an SO2 matrix as cosine theta minus sine sine cosine or equivalently we can say that the

367
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:26,080
general form of an SO2 matrix is a negative b b a with the constraint that a squared plus b squared

368
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:32,800
equals one and you can see that this is the same thing by the substitution a is cosine of theta

369
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,200
and b is sine theta and when you write it in terms of a and b and a squared plus b squared equals one

370
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,760
you see that we have a unit circle of possible SO2 matrices okay now with that in mind let's

371
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:53,920
look at the definition of an SU2 matrix so an SU2 matrix involves complex elements we'll

372
00:34:53,920 --> 00:35:01,280
symbolize them as alpha and beta and it has the form alpha negative beta conjugate beta alpha

373
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,840
conjugate where alpha and beta are complex numbers and the magnitude of alpha squared plus the

374
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:14,240
magnitude of beta squared equals one you can see that in the special case that alpha and beta are

375
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:21,680
real numbers then this matrix has the form of an SO2 matrix but because alpha and beta can be complex

376
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,720
numbers SU2 is actually a more general kind of matrix than an SO2 matrix it has more degrees of

377
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:38,080
freedom and whereas an SO2 matrix acts on real valued two component vectors an SU2 matrix being

378
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:46,400
complex naturally is going to act on complex valued two component vectors those complex valued two

379
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,880
component vectors are called spinners and this is one way of thinking about what a spinner is

380
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,680
it's the vector like thing that an SU2 matrix acts upon by the way there are ways of generalizing

381
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,360
the concept of spinners using other kinds of matrices but i'm not going to worry about that

382
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,840
today today we're just focused on two component complex spinners which are the most common kind

383
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,360
of spinner you'll encounter in physics okay now something you can see by exploring the properties

384
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:21,520
of these SU2 matrices is that they have determinant one and that the inverse of the matrix is the

385
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:28,000
complex conjugate transpose of the matrix so this is very very similar to a special orthogonal

386
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,200
matrix but technically the correct word now is special unitary matrix where unitary refers to

387
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,200
the fact that the inverse of the matrix is the complex conjugate transpose of the matrix and

388
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,640
that complex conjugation comes in because the dot product of two complex vectors involves a complex

389
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,280
conjugation and so in order to preserve lengths and angles between complex vectors we have to

390
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,040
preserve the dot product and so there's a complex conjugation that comes in in order to preserve

391
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,200
dot products but anyway i'm not going to go into too much detail on that just know that these are

392
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:09,200
the constraints on SU2 matrices okay so what we've looked at so far is a very algebraic definition

393
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,040
of SU2 and what we should look at now is the picture of what do these matrices actually do

394
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,200
so the way to do that is to first draw some reference spinner and this will be analogous to

395
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,880
the reference vector we looked at when we looked at SU2 and then we're going to multiply it by an

396
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,680
SU2 matrix and we're going to see how it transforms so first of all how should we even draw a two

397
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,400
component complex vector well there's a lot of different ways of drawing it but today i'm just

398
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,760
going to keep it simple we're going to look at one complex plane and then i'll put two dots in the

399
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,000
plane corresponding to the two components of the complex vector and i'll draw a line between them

400
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,680
just to highlight the point that these two dots are actually two parts of the same object there's

401
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,280
another way of looking at all this math in four dimensions but we're not going to get into that

402
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:07,360
today anyway so when we multiply our reference spinner by SU2 matrices we can see that it kind

403
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:15,680
of goes around and it it spins and it transforms in this rotational kind of way and so naturally

404
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,760
we can ask the question of what are the degrees of freedom here as we're transforming our spinner

405
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,320
how does it evolve and how many degrees of freedom does it have well naively it should

406
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,800
have four degrees of freedom right because there is two complex numbers and each complex number

407
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,480
has two degrees of freedom in the complex plane but we're going to take out a degree of freedom

408
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,400
by virtue of the fact that the su2 matrix has determinant one and is unitary and so what that

409
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,000
means is that this spinner is not changing in size and that means that the magnitude squared of the

410
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,320
first component plus the magnitude squared of the second component is always going to equal one

411
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,640
so we actually have three degrees of freedom here and these three degrees of freedom are isomorphic

412
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,600
to the hypersphere which is the locus of points in four dimensions that are all equidistant from

413
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,760
the origin which you can see when you think about it right you start off with four pure

414
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,240
degrees of freedom and then constrain them so that they have to be constant size what you

415
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,000
end up with is a hypersphere interestingly the hypersphere is a simply connected space that'll

416
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,640
be really important later but for now just think of these spinners as rotating around spinning around

417
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,920
in a way that is simply connected okay so here we have three degrees of freedom

418
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:39,280
and it involves some kind of spinny rotating thing so the question arises does this have any

419
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,440
connection to s03 that is the three-dimensional rotations maybe it will maybe it won't right i

420
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,480
mean if we're just thinking about it from a mathematical perspective that's a legitimate

421
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,160
question to ask and as it turns out shockingly there is a very very close connection between

422
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:02,000
s02 and s03 and in particular s02 double covers s03 let me explain what that means

423
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,720
so imagine we have s03 which acts on some three-dimensional vector and rotates it

424
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:15,360
and we also have s02 which is going to act on some two-component complex vector that we call a

425
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,120
spinner and it's going to transform it and kind of spin it around what the double cover means is

426
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:28,400
that we can draw a connection between any possible rotation in three dimensions and any possible

427
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,680
s02 transformation on these spinners in this two complex dimensional space

428
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:42,160
but the connection is not one to one it's actually two to one for every rotation in three dimensions

429
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:50,240
we have precisely two possible s02 transformations and moreover those two s02 transformations

430
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,760
are related to each other in that they only differ by a minus sign so you know at the beginning of

431
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,400
the video i mentioned that quote by michael atia where he was talking about how spinners are in

432
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,480
some sense the square root of geometry and you really see this in the way that s02 double covers

433
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,680
s03 because if you think about it what is the square root of four well it's two but it's also

434
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,680
negative two and what is the square root of nine well it's three but it's also negative three so

435
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,000
when you take the square root of something you get an answer but you actually get two answers

436
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,240
that differ only by a minus sign likewise if you look at any rotation in three dimensions

437
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,480
which corresponds to a single s03 element and you ask what is the corresponding s02 element

438
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,160
you get an answer but you actually get two answers that are related by a minus sign

439
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:48,160
okay now let's talk about the spinner way of rotating things so because s02

440
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:54,480
double covers s03 there's an intimate connection between every s02 transformation

441
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,680
and every rotation in three-dimensional space therefore if we wanted to we could mathematically

442
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:08,560
deal with rotations using the framework of s02 matrices instead of s03 but we would just have

443
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,120
to ignore the redundancy that comes with a double cover but that's not really a problem I mean we

444
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:17,280
can literally just ignore the redundancy right we can just project it out let me give you an

445
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,600
analogy so suppose that there is a math problem and you have some computer program that calculates

446
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:29,280
the answer but it's kind of slow and it takes a while to run so you run your program you wait a

447
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,120
moment while it calculates and then let's say you see that the answer is four well okay if you're

448
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:40,960
not in a rush that method works fine but let's say you're really in a hurry or maybe you have to do

449
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,720
a bunch of these calculations super fast so you look for a way to do it faster and then you discover

450
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,400
a faster method but the catch is that it doesn't give you the answer but instead it gives you the

451
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,720
square root of the answer so if the answer is four then sometimes the fast method gives you two

452
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,520
and sometimes it gives you negative two okay fine that's actually not a problem at all because you

453
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,040
can just square it and the ambiguity washes out and you've got your answer the same reasoning

454
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:15,520
applies to using su2 to do rotations because it turns out that su2 lends itself to faster

455
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,200
more numerically stable calculations than so3 and even though there are two possible spinners

456
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:27,200
for each so3 orientation they only differ by a minus sign which can easily be washed away

457
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,200
don't get me wrong so3 is pretty fast too I mean I used like a million so3 matrices while

458
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,800
making this video but then again I also rendered these animations overnight I wasn't in a hurry so

459
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,440
I just took the easier route in terms of thinking about so3 and axis angle vectors and Rodriguez

460
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,280
formula and that worked fine the only time I really had to use su2 for 3d rotations is when

461
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,400
making these colored flag animations those are actually based on su2 because I wanted it to

462
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,080
match the spinners anyway with animations there's not really a time constraint so you might as well

463
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:05,920
just think in terms of axis angle vectors Rodriguez formula so3 rotation matrices because it's easier

464
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,440
on the brain and usually there's no benefit to rotating a vector like a microsecond faster so

465
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,960
why torture yourself if you don't have to but if you are writing software for video game graphics

466
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,480
or a vision system for a self-driving car or the attitude control system for a rocket then you'll

467
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,360
for sure want to use su2 because in those cases you're going to have to rotate a lot of vectors

468
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:32,400
very quickly and the only cost of using su2 is that it's harder to think about when you're

469
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,800
writing the code because your imagination has to roll around on a hypersphere and it's kind of dizzying

470
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,160
but at the end of the day you'll end up with a code that's faster uses less ram and is more zen

471
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:51,840
than a code that uses so3 the numbers flow more gracefully when you use su2 su2 also lets you

472
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:58,160
avoid the problem of gimbal lock which affects so3 i don't have time to go into it today but google

473
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:06,880
Apollo 11 gimbal lock for a cautionary tale about the perils of so3 also when using su2 for

474
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,480
rotations in three dimensions people often use the quaternion representation because it's clean

475
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:19,040
and simple we saw earlier that there's an isomorphism between so2 and the unit complex numbers

476
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,880
and similarly there's an isomorphism between su2 and the unit quaternions and by the way this

477
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,800
isomorphism makes manifest the hyperspherical topology of su2 so anyway whenever you hear people

478
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,320
talking about a rotation algorithm that uses su2 or spinners or quaternions it's all the same

479
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,280
the basic idea is that you're doing your rotational math in this weird simply connected

480
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,080
hyperspherical kind of redundant group that somehow lives like kind of underneath the vector

481
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:54,560
rotations it's uh it's very bizarre but it works somehow it works and so su2 is actually used

482
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,320
ubiquitously in applications that demand maximum performance and so su2 is more than just some

483
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:05,280
fanciful abstraction it's actually very practical and you know it'd be one thing if it were just

484
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,400
practical it'd be one thing if su2 was just like a more efficient way to do rotations and you just

485
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,760
ignore the spinner phase fine i mean okay that's cool but that's not particularly profound but

486
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,080
the thing that's really a trip is that in theoretical physics the spinner phase actually

487
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:26,320
matters so su2 is not just another way of doing rotations but that redundancy that you wash out

488
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,960
if you're just doing like video game graphics that actually is something that's relevant to the

489
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,920
wave function of a relativistic electron for example and as we'll see later in the video

490
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:42,240
that is a very very deep mystery as to why that's the case okay so let's look at one more double

491
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:48,240
cover animation and then we'll talk about the physical mystery of spinners so here we have a

492
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:56,160
very very complicated rotational path and it's all like and it's all like swooping around and doing

493
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:02,080
all these moves and the point i want to illustrate here is that even when the rotational path is

494
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:08,960
super complicated there's still this connection between the flag rotating an so3 and the spinner

495
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,480
rotating with an su2 matrix there's still that two to one connection such that if we go around

496
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,360
a class one curve we end up with the phase switched then if we run that class one curve again

497
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,800
bring it full circle we end up doing a class two and we end up back to where we started

498
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:29,760
so let's take a closer look at this and we can see exactly how that happens okay so first it comes

499
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,200
in it's like shoo shoo and then look it's about to teleport right there do you see that okay cool

500
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,280
let's keep it going now it comes around and look we'll pause here okay now it's come back to where

501
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,080
it started but the phase is reversed as indicated by the fact that the flag is red and also if you

502
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:50,240
look at the plot you can see that the spinner is the negative of what we started out with

503
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,760
all right and continuing it's going to swoop around and it's going to teleport right now

504
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,800
and it's going to come back through and it'll end up back where it started so we've done two

505
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,160
class ones and that's a class two and that brings us back to the starting point isn't this neat I

506
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:12,960
think it's neat the thing I really want to impress upon you is that su2 double covers s03 and it's

507
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,560
like a perfect double cover it's like a hand in the glove or like I guess a hand in two gloves you

508
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:24,080
know so like that's really cool you know like what what does that mean right I mean the algebra I

509
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,600
think as you can see the algebra is formally understood I mean look at all the numbers on the

510
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,840
screen if you pause it at any moment in time you can check for yourself the matrices are right

511
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:38,400
and you know all the equations we've looked at that's all true it's all good but why like what

512
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,160
does this mean you know the funny thing is when making these videos the equations are the easy

513
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:50,160
part because an equation is just a recipe and I can put it in the computer and make an animation

514
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,920
and I can just tell you how it is and how it works the hard part is conveying the sense of mystery

515
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,640
I mean aside from the fact that it's just kind of confusing and like whoa what are these things

516
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,520
but how can I share with you that sense of awe and wonder that so many people have when they work

517
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,000
with spinners especially in the context of physics and you know that's much more of a storytelling

518
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,600
problem that's the objective there is to really share a state of mind or an attitude and so I

519
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,600
just want to tell you about it from my point of view so please take everything I'm about to say

520
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:24,160
with a grain of salt this is just my perspective but I hope it resonates with you as well

521
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:32,000
okay so you might have heard of the five stages of grief well I like to think that there's a

522
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,320
similar five stages that you go through when learning about spinners uh hear me out so except

523
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:44,720
it's not as bad instead of anger it's astonishment and instead of depression it's existential shock

524
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,800
now I don't think anyone's ever gotten to the fifth stage but I can tell you about the first four

525
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,240
so starting off with the denial stage if you tell someone that there's something that you have to

526
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,800
rotate it twice to get back to where it started they're just gonna tell you no you're wrong like

527
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,600
that can't be like have you ever rotated an object everyone knows all you need is to do a 360

528
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:10,320
rotation in any axis and then you get back to where you started this is like a basic fact of

529
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:16,480
reality and look I get it I mean I understand I've rotated objects too I've actually personally

530
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,360
rotated back in the days when I used to jump out of planes I spent a lot of time rotating

531
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:26,720
atmospherically so I'm not naive when it comes to rotations I've been around a time or two

532
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,080
sorry I couldn't resist the pun anyway if there's one thing that I know and you know and everyone

533
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:37,440
knows it's that a rotation of 360 degrees is all you need to get back to where you started

534
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,160
you don't need a 720 rotation so what is this spinner stuff it makes no sense so that's the

535
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:48,080
denial stage and what breaks you out of the denial stage is when you become really familiar with

536
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:55,200
the math so when you get to know so3 and su2 and you see that su2 double covers so3 you see that

537
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:01,280
so3 is not simply connected but su2 is and so now you have two different ways of looking at rotations

538
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,440
and one of them is kind of more elegant but in some sense more redundant than the other and it's

539
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,480
sort of like okay there's something here now when you become familiar with the math it's very

540
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:16,640
astonishing so I like to call this the astonishment phase and this is when you might be very curious

541
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,800
about the math and you might study it a lot more you might explore it you might write some Python

542
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,680
codes you might investigate every which way you can rotate these different things and you might make

543
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:31,040
pretty plots and it's very wonderful and beautiful and you find that there's a very rich structure

544
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,080
here that you can spend a lot of time exploring and after having done that there's no way that you

545
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:42,560
can go back to the denial stage but even still you feel the need to contextualize the math you feel

546
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:47,520
the need to say okay but what does it all mean and how literally should I take it and what are the

547
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:53,680
physical implications if any and the part of you in your heart is not going to want there to be any

548
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,560
physical implications I mean you want to think it's just the product of a mathematician's overactive

549
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,480
imagination you don't want to think there's anything in the world that actually does have

550
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,440
to rotate twice to get back to where it started because that's deeply unsettling and so we enter

551
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,800
into the bargaining stage where we say okay fine mathematically sure yeah spinners are a thing but

552
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:18,800
it's not physics this isn't real this isn't like tangible and so you can sort of argue the math

553
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,360
and physics and say no it's just a useful fiction it's just the structure of the equations but it

554
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,880
doesn't have any physical implications and the problem is that is a losing battle because the

555
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,480
more you learn physics the more prominent and essential spinners become you know for example

556
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,960
look at the Dirac equation look at the wave function of an electron it's a bi-spinner field

557
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,160
and it's this thing that's written in terms of spinners and it's at the heart of quantum physics

558
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,440
so okay but you still want to bargain some more you still want to say well our understanding of

559
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,320
physics is incomplete and so the Dirac equation maybe there's a way of writing it without spinners

560
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,800
so you look into geometric algebra and these different ways of writing the Dirac equation

561
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,600
and you find that nope no matter what you always have spinners or something equivalent to spinners

562
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,480
and so then you say okay but maybe the Dirac equation itself is wrong in some sense and then

563
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,600
so okay it's like what is the Dirac equation well it's three ingredients it's Lorenz invariance

564
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,760
it's the quantum mechanical energy momentum operators and it's the requirement that the

565
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,120
equations be first order in space and time now to the first one of those things no one has ever

566
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:29,280
observed a violation of Lorenz invariance and in my opinion in my lifetime probably no one ever will

567
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,000
now do i think that Lorenz invariance is literally true at every scale no personally i don't but

568
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,880
i also don't think we're ever gonna be observing any deviations from it anytime soon so if you want

569
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,600
to try to undermine the importance of spinners in physics by arguing against Lorenz invariance

570
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:48,320
it's not gonna work out likewise with the quantum mechanical energy momentum operators

571
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,800
i mean there's really not much room for flexibility here because they describe so

572
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,560
well pretty much like everything i mean you want to look at the black body spectrum you want to

573
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:01,440
look at like the hydrogen energy levels so you're not going to be doing away with the quantum

574
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,000
mechanical energy momentum operators but if you look at the third ingredient the fact that the

575
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,520
equations have to be first order in space and time here we do have a little bit of leeway because

576
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,480
with the benefit of historical hindsight we can say that dirac was a little bit misguided

577
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,360
in his original approach you know i think it's fair to say that he was right but perhaps for

578
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:27,440
the wrong reasons or maybe better for reasons that were not fully appreciated or understood at the

579
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,400
time anyway with the development of quantum field theory we now know that you can have

580
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,280
particles that aren't fermions and so there's no reason for us to think that the electron

581
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,080
must be a fermion it just so happens that they are and it just so happens that the way to write

582
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,520
that wave function is to say that it's a first order equation in space and time take the square

583
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,560
to the mashel spinners pop out you know that whole thing so it's right but it's not obvious that

584
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:57,200
it's like mathematically necessary for an electron to be a fermion aha so the way we're going to

585
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:03,200
bargain out of having to deal with spinners is to say that the electron is not actually a fermion

586
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,600
instead we can just choose to model it as a spinless particle right so instead of a bi-spinner

587
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:12,160
field we could just use a complex scalar field for its wave function sort of like schrodinger or

588
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:18,000
Klein-Gordon and there are kind of ways to do that if you're dealing with one electron and are okay

589
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,800
making an approximation but the problem is if you take that approach while you're trying to deal

590
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,080
with multi-electron systems like if we're doing quantum chemistry or condensed matter physics

591
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:32,400
then that approach doesn't work because we get slapped in the face with something called the

592
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,440
spin statistics theorem and it's such a hard slap that we get knocked out of the bargaining phase

593
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:43,680
and into the existential shock phase the spin statistics theorem deserves its own video and

594
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,720
actually for now i'll just say there's an excellent book written on it called poly and the spin

595
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:55,600
statistics theorem by ian duck and ecg sudarshan it's a very interesting book and i highly recommend

596
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:00,000
it if you want a good overview of the history of this theorem and its profound implications

597
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,800
and what is known about it and what is still not known about it but anyway for today we just have

598
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,960
to know what the theorem says in a nutshell it says that particles with half integer spin are

599
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,800
fermions and their wave function will pick up a minus sign when two particles are exchanged

600
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,720
and that leads into fermi dirac statistics

601
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:30,160
on the other hand particles with integer spin are bosons and their wave function will remain the

602
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:37,360
same when two particles are exchanged that leads into bows einstein statistics in short the spin

603
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:42,960
statistics theorem says that there is a direct and mysterious link between the minus sign or lack

604
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:50,480
thereof picked up by a particle under 360 degree rotation and the minus sign or lack thereof picked

605
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:56,320
up by a multi particle wave function under the exchange of any two particles this fact is going

606
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,600
to lead to radically different behavior depending on whether you're dealing with an ensemble of

607
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:08,240
fermions or an ensemble of bosons bosons don't mind being all up in the same quantum state at the

608
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:15,360
same time it's all good but fermions will never share the same quantum state they do not like to

609
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:21,840
be together there's a principle that every high school chemistry student learns called the poly

610
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:28,000
exclusion principle it says that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state at the same time

611
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:34,880
this is a profound principle with far-reaching consequences it plays an absolutely fundamental

612
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:40,160
role in chemistry it's the reason for example that atoms have different orbitals that the electrons

613
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,320
have to stay in you know because you might wonder why isn't it that uh an atom at rest why can't

614
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,480
all the electrons collapse into the ground state together what is it that keeps some of them propped

615
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,120
up into higher energy states well it's the poly exclusion principle you know the lower orbitals

616
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:58,480
are already filled up so chemistry students take this for granted as sort of one of the axioms of

617
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:04,320
chemistry but with physics we go a bit deeper and right now we're actually logically one level

618
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:10,400
underneath the poly exclusion principle because it follows as a consequence of the more fundamental

619
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:17,840
spin statistics theorem to see this just consider a system of n electrons whose multi particle wave

620
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:25,600
function can be written as psi is a function of x1 x2 dot dot dot xa dot dot xb dot dot dot xn

621
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:31,280
where x sub n in this context refers to all the quantum numbers of the nth particle

622
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:38,800
including spatial coordinates and spin now suppose we switch electrons a and b according to the spin

623
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:44,960
statistics theorem because electrons are fermions the new wave function is just the minus sign of

624
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:50,400
the original one so psi of the original quantum numbers is going to equal negative psi of the

625
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,000
same quantum numbers but with the numbers for a and b switched around so all we've done so far is

626
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,280
basically just stated generically what the spin statistics theorem tells us about fermions but

627
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:07,280
suppose now that we force electrons a and b into the same quantum state with the power of imagination

628
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,520
then by the symmetry of what it means for two things to be the same we conclude that there is no

629
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:18,880
difference between the original and swapped wave function by definition there can't be if a and

630
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,600
b are the same state then you switch them nothing can change right because they're the same well

631
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:29,200
now here we have two apparently contradictory things when particles a and b are exchanged

632
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,640
the wave function both does and doesn't pick up a minus sign how can that possibly be because

633
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:40,160
we're saying that psi has to equal negative psi well that can only be the case if psi is precisely

634
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:46,480
zero and because psi is a probability amplitude we conclude that it is absolutely impossible

635
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:52,160
for two fermions to occupy the same quantum state at the same time there is zero probability of that

636
00:59:52,160 --> 01:00:00,000
happening and that is the poly exclusion principle notice that this argument does not apply to bosons

637
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,040
with bosons there's no minus sign picked up under particle exchange and so there's no logical

638
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:09,760
tension when you put two particles in the same state switch the identical particles around all

639
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:14,560
you want it's all good and that's why the poly exclusion principle does not apply to photons

640
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:19,840
for example photons or bosons and they can share the same quantum state no problem and in fact they

641
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:25,520
often prefer to do so you can see that the spin statistics theorem is quite profound and plays a

642
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:31,040
major role in shaping the world all around us but why is it true where does this all important

643
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:37,120
principle come from well we know that the spin statistics theorem is true every moment is bursting

644
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:42,480
with an abundance of empirical evidence supporting the theorem as electron orbitals continue to exist

645
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:48,480
and photons continue to be able to occupy the same state additionally the theorem follows logically

646
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,360
from the assumptions of quantum field theory and it's been proven rigorously in that context

647
01:00:53,920 --> 01:01:00,080
but despite all that nobody really understands in a geometric or visual way why there is this

648
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:05,840
mysterious connection between spin and particle exchange if you think you do understand it because

649
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:11,520
you've seen Feynman's topological argument or some similar intuitive proof read chapter 20 of the

650
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:17,120
spin statistics book long story short those so-called proofs are actually analogies without

651
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:23,200
any explanatory power but they are fun to think about okay fine now there is one last battle

652
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:28,080
where we try to work our way back into the bargaining phase and that is to say well maybe the spin

653
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:33,200
statistics theorem is not actually logically underneath the poly exclusion principle maybe

654
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,160
it's just some kind of cosmic coincidence so maybe spin doesn't play a fundamentally

655
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:43,440
consequential role in the spin statistics theorem but instead maybe it just so happens to be that

656
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:48,000
the particles in our universe that happen to be fermions happen to obey the poly exclusion principle

657
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,360
whereas bosons do not now this is unlikely but we're really grasping at straws here to try to

658
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,320
retain some semblance of our natural intuition you know we don't want to feel like the world is

659
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:04,480
much more bizarre than it seems but but it is but anyway the final nail in the coffin is to say okay

660
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:11,600
look what if we take an electron and we change its spin so that it no longer is a half integer kind

661
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:18,160
of thing but actually behaves as a boson then if that electron is set free of the poly exclusion

662
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:23,600
principle we would know that we actually are logically underneath the poly exclusion principle

663
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:28,800
right now because that experiment would give us a definitive proof that the poly exclusion

664
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:34,080
principle actually does arise from the spin statistics theorem in a really meaningful way

665
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:41,920
now it's actually not super easy to convert electrons into bosons but it can be done in

666
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,120
some materials because of the way electrons mutually interact with the crystal lattice

667
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:52,720
you can occasionally get a spin up electron pairing up with a spin down electron and that pair of

668
01:02:52,720 --> 01:03:00,480
electrons has a net spin of zero and so the pair of electrons is collectively a bosonic entity

669
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:07,680
so in the material you can have a great many of these and they're able to condense into something

670
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:13,440
that's spiritually very similar to a boson stein condensate and they genuinely are occupying the

671
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,240
same state at the same time which electrons hardly ever do but when you convert them to bosons all

672
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:22,560
we're doing is modifying their spin we're not changing their charge we're not taking away any

673
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:27,600
mass or any of that we're just pairing them up so the spin cancels out and now we set them free

674
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:32,640
from the poly exclusion principle they condense into a very low energy state and can slip through a

675
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:38,240
material like a ghost without interacting with the atoms along the way and this is the phenomenon

676
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:44,160
of superconductivity and so superconductivity gives us an undeniable proof that the spin

677
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:49,440
statistics theorem is genuinely underneath the poly exclusion principle by the way we'll have a

678
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,720
lot more to say in the future about superconductivity it is an incredible phenomenon and you know i've

679
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:00,800
personally seen what a superconductor can do my colleagues and i have sent enormous electrical

680
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:06,560
currents through superconductors many thousands of times the intensity that would melt copper

681
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,640
and i've watched it stay cool as a cucumber it doesn't heat up at all because all that current

682
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:17,280
is being carried by these superelectrons that are behaving as bosons and so it's not even like

683
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:22,320
regular physics like we know and love it it's like this weird surreal like crazy version of

684
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:26,480
reality where the poly exclusion principle only you know doesn't always apply to every electron

685
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,520
i think it's amazing it's a wonderful thing so we'll talk about that a lot in the future we'll

686
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:34,160
get into uh ginsberg landau and flux quantization and all that good stuff but anyway today i just

687
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:39,920
bring it up to highlight that this whole spinner thing you know it's real it's mysterious and if

688
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,720
you take away the spinner nature of the electrons wave function you get some pretty bizarre and

689
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:50,080
surreal effects that actually are real this is not just theory this is not just socrates

690
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:55,520
philosophies and hypotheses no this is like real like technology like engineering people are building

691
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:02,160
devices with this stuff so you know so that's something to think about anyway is it possible

692
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:07,520
to reach the acceptance stage and to really understand spinners in a way that would satisfy

693
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:14,800
even michael atia maybe but we're not there yet among other things the lack of an intuitive but

694
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:20,800
rigorous proof of the spin statistics theorem shows that we don't fully understand the significance

695
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:26,240
of spinners in physical reality we're aware of spinners we're able to work with them we know

696
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:31,680
how their algebra works but we still do not know why spinner valued wave functions are anti symmetric

697
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,560
under particle exchange now you might be thinking rich come on now you're just dramatizing your

698
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:40,800
own ignorance this isn't actually a mystery you just don't know the answer well it's true that I

699
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,440
don't know the answer but i'm not the only one who thinks that this is a mystery let me share with

700
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,960
you this quote from the spin statistics book this quote is in a passage about whether or not physics

701
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:55,520
can explain the spin statistics theorem or is just consistent with spin statistics

702
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:03,760
we should modify the meaning of understand and at the same time reduce our expectations of any

703
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:11,680
proof of the spin statistics theorem what is proved whether truly or not whether optimally or not

704
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:19,120
in an acceptable logical sequence or not is that the existing theory is consistent with the spin

705
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:25,760
statistics relation what is not demonstrated is a reason for the spin statistics relation

706
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,920
to belabor the point it is difficult to imagine a fundamental mechanism for the

707
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:38,640
poly exclusion principle upon which all depends which predicates it upon the analyticity properties

708
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:46,080
of vacuum expectation values of products of quantized field operators did god for lack of a

709
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:53,200
better word build a series of failed worlds which sputtered and died or exploded and disintegrated

710
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,720
before discovering the stabilizing effect of anti commutation relations for half integral spin fields

711
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,880
was this before or after imposing the requirements of Lorenz invariance

712
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,680
are we the lucky winners of a Monte Carlo simulation in which every choice was tried

713
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:14,320
and one survived must we reduce our demands on physics to require only consistency

714
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,920
does an understanding of the why of the spin statistics relation have no direct answer in

715
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:27,520
physics or must physics be formulated to include it the poly result does not explain the spin

716
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:32,320
statistics relation and cannot the noix wanders and the Feynman's of the world

717
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:37,360
must remain unsatisfied because the consistency of relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum

718
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:42,400
field theory with the poly exclusion principle has every reason to be as complicated as these

719
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:48,320
subjects are not as simple and direct as the poly exclusion principle itself

720
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:55,440
so in short there there sure is a lot of mystery here and it's confusing but it's kind of cool

721
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:01,040
to think about right but you know honestly i can only think about spinners for so long

722
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:06,640
before it starts to hurt it's like diving underwater you try to go as deep as you can but

723
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:11,520
at some point you have to come back up for air and it's all so disorienting that sometimes

724
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,520
when you stop thinking about spinners it's all so confusing and you feel like you're right back

725
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:22,240
to square one but my friends if there's one thing that spinners have taught us it's that just

726
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:27,040
because you returned to where you started doesn't mean you haven't picked something up along the way

727
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,040
so in that spirit i'd like to reiterate part of the quote from the beginning of the video

728
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:38,800
no one fully understands spinners their algebra is formally understood

729
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:45,280
but their general significance is mysterious i hope today i've given you some sense of the

730
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:48,720
algebra but most importantly an appreciation of the mystery

731
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:55,760
if you enjoyed watching this video as much as i enjoyed making it

732
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:00,720
then please consider supporting my channel on patreon on there you'll be able to download

733
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:06,160
these beautiful magnificent pdfs with the equations and diagrams discussed in this video

734
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:11,680
and other videos too also if you sign up on patreon your input will help determine the

735
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:16,320
future direction of this channel i know what i'm going to do for the next few videos at least but

736
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:20,720
beyond that i don't know i need your advice what do you want to see where do you want to go you

737
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:24,800
want to go into electromagnetism as a gauge theory you want to go into superconductivity do you want

738
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:29,840
to go into whatever the case may be so anyway your support is not obligatory but it is greatly

739
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:36,640
and sincerely appreciated all right well hey thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next one
