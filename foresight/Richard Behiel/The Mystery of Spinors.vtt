Hey y'all, today we'll be talking about spinners. These things are really cool. Once you learn

00:09.160 --> 00:14.540
about spinners, your life will never be the same. You'll develop a lingering, justified

00:14.540 --> 00:20.180
suspicion that this world is not as it seems. And you might also develop a lifelong addiction

00:20.180 --> 00:23.600
to physics. So, you've been warned.

00:23.600 --> 00:28.040
To set the tone, I'd like to start off with a quote by the renowned mathematician, fields

00:28.040 --> 00:35.400
metallist and knight, Sir Michael Atia. No one fully understands spinners. Their algebra

00:35.400 --> 00:41.640
is formally understood, but their general significance is mysterious. In some sense,

00:41.640 --> 00:46.160
they describe the square root of geometry, and just as understanding the square root

00:46.160 --> 00:52.560
of negative one took centuries, the same might be true of spinners. Michael was an extraordinary

00:52.560 --> 00:57.600
mathematician, and if he of all people says that no one fully understands spinners, then

00:57.680 --> 01:01.440
it's okay if we're a little confused when we first learn about spinners. Spinners are

01:01.440 --> 01:06.040
confusing, frankly they're disorienting, and not particularly intuitive. You know, if you tell

01:06.040 --> 01:09.960
someone there's a thing that you have to rotate twice to get back to where it started, they might

01:09.960 --> 01:14.240
think you're a little insane. But really, the insane thing is that spinners are not insane.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.520
They're mathematically coherent, they show up in our most fundamental laws of physics,

01:18.520 --> 01:24.000
and they refuse to go away. Spinners are really at the core of fundamental physics. I mean,

01:24.000 --> 01:28.480
look at the way function of an electron, for example, or any fermion for that matter. If not

01:28.480 --> 01:32.720
for spinners, we wouldn't have the poly exclusion principle, and so we wouldn't have chemistry.

01:32.720 --> 01:38.640
Matter would collapse, and the world would be a very boring place. So there's no way of restructuring

01:38.640 --> 01:44.040
physics in a way that you don't have spinners, and therefore these strange weird little mathematical

01:44.040 --> 01:47.760
objects we do actually have to deal with, and we have to work with, and we have to understand,

01:47.760 --> 01:53.200
where does this come from, what does it mean, why do these things exist, and it's really mysterious.

01:54.160 --> 01:59.760
Okay, but what is a spinner? Hmm. Well, in the last few videos, we've been developing some of the

01:59.760 --> 02:03.760
basics of relativistic quantum physics. We've looked at Klein-Gordon, we've looked at the

02:03.760 --> 02:07.840
Dirac equation, we've looked at an example of Dirac equation for the eigenstate of a particle

02:07.840 --> 02:13.120
at rest, and while we've done that, we've seen that spinners have emerged as the sort of two

02:13.120 --> 02:18.960
component complex numbers. But today, I don't just want to define spinners as a pair of complex

02:18.960 --> 02:24.560
numbers, because that's not particularly geometrically insightful. Instead, I want to show you an

02:24.560 --> 02:29.200
argument for why we should expect something like spinners to exist in the first place,

02:29.200 --> 02:34.560
and we'll do that by exploring a very subtle thing about the way objects rotate in three dimensions.

02:35.120 --> 02:39.360
That'll open up a crack in reality that we can use to smuggle spinners into our imagination.

02:40.080 --> 02:43.840
Then after that, we can explore the algebraic properties of spinners, we can see where the

02:43.840 --> 02:47.680
complex numbers come in, we can see how we can draw spinners as flags, we can look at how they

02:47.680 --> 02:52.000
transform under rotations, and finally, we'll tie it all back into the Dirac equation and we'll

02:52.000 --> 02:56.880
talk about how this relates to electrons. This video will hopefully answer many questions,

02:56.880 --> 03:01.600
and it'll surely raise many more. Spinners are one of those things where the more you

03:01.600 --> 03:04.400
learn about them, the more wonderful and magical they become.

03:09.200 --> 03:14.720
Before we talk about rotations, there are a few vocabulary words that we need to borrow from

03:14.720 --> 03:24.320
topology. These are homotopic, simply connected, and homotopy class. So imagine we have a whiteboard,

03:24.880 --> 03:30.880
and we've drawn a squiggly loop. The loop is alive and sentient and is feeling its way around

03:30.880 --> 03:37.280
the whiteboard. As it goes along, in each moment it takes on a different shape, but it doesn't

03:37.280 --> 03:44.240
break apart. It can stretch and shrink, but it can't be cut, and from one moment to the next,

03:44.240 --> 03:50.240
its topology stays the same. The fancy way to say this is that it's evolving into different

03:50.240 --> 03:57.520
loops that are all homotopic. Homo is in same, and topic is in topology, so homotopic means

03:57.520 --> 04:03.600
that they have the same topology. Oh, whoa, little guy's getting nervous. Eh, that's okay.

04:03.600 --> 04:09.120
Stage fright, you know, it's understandable. Oh, there it goes, shrinking down to a point.

04:09.120 --> 04:13.760
It's a defense mechanism. That's fine, you know, I'm a bit shy myself, so who am I to judge?

04:14.480 --> 04:18.880
Anyway, the reason our loop was able to shrink like that is that there wasn't an obstacle,

04:18.880 --> 04:24.480
or a hole, or something weird that got in its way. Instead, it just had a nice, smooth,

04:24.480 --> 04:31.120
simple space, so it was able to shrink on down to a point. And that is our next vocabulary word,

04:31.120 --> 04:38.000
simply connected. A space is simply connected if all the loops that live in the space

04:38.000 --> 04:43.120
can shrink down to a point whenever they want to. But now what if we take our whiteboard

04:43.120 --> 04:47.920
and we drill a hole in the middle? So now as the loop explores its environment,

04:47.920 --> 04:52.320
it goes around and it realizes that it can't go into the hole and it can't escape the board,

04:52.880 --> 04:58.400
but it can still shrink if it wants to, so no problems there. But now consider this little guy,

04:58.400 --> 05:02.480
which was born into quite a predicament. It's wrapped all the way around the hole,

05:02.480 --> 05:07.840
so it can't shrink down to a point. When it's feeling shy, at best it can only become a small

05:07.920 --> 05:14.160
circle, not a point. So that tells us that this space, whiteboard with a hole in it,

05:14.160 --> 05:21.120
is not simply connected. So now think about this, the loop on the left can evolve into a variety

05:21.120 --> 05:26.160
of different shapes that are all homotopic to each other. All the different forms that it can

05:26.160 --> 05:32.400
take on are all a loop that lives between the hole and the edge of the whiteboard. Likewise,

05:32.400 --> 05:36.640
the loop on the right can also evolve into many different homotopic shapes,

05:36.640 --> 05:41.520
but those are all wrapped around the hole. And so you see here we have two different

05:41.520 --> 05:47.280
homotopic classes, class in the sense of like a set of entities that all have something in common.

05:48.800 --> 05:53.200
So we can say that the loops fall into different classes depending on whether or not they wrap

05:53.200 --> 05:58.320
around the hole. And actually it's a bit more complicated than that because in this case you

05:58.320 --> 06:03.440
could also have loops that wrap around the hole multiple times. And so we actually have a different

06:03.440 --> 06:08.640
homotopic class for each number of times it wraps around. And so the winding number matters,

06:08.640 --> 06:13.040
the number of times that the curve is wound around the hole that matters. But those are all

06:13.040 --> 06:18.320
the homotopic classes of loops on the whiteboard. You can organize them just by specifying the so

06:18.320 --> 06:23.280
called winding number. And a curve that has a certain winding number cannot be continuously

06:23.280 --> 06:28.000
deformed into having a different winding number. So you can stretch them and shrink them but you

06:28.000 --> 06:32.320
can't change the winding number unless you cut the loop which is not allowed. This hurts the loop.

06:32.960 --> 06:39.440
Do not hurt the loop. Okay. Oh by the way in this context the loop can pass through itself so we

06:39.440 --> 06:43.360
don't have to worry about the loop getting tangled up in knots and what are the different kinds of

06:43.360 --> 06:47.840
knots and all that. No no it doesn't matter. The purpose of these loops are not to model like

06:47.840 --> 06:52.960
physical rubber bands but just to tell us something about the nature of the space in which they live.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.840
Oh one more thing on this topic. Imagine we repair the whiteboard so there's no more hole.

06:59.840 --> 07:04.160
But now it has the magical property that the left and right edges of the board

07:04.160 --> 07:09.600
are identified with each other such that the loop can appear to teleport from one side to the other.

07:10.720 --> 07:14.640
So there's no longer a hole in the board but there is this weird teleporting situation.

07:16.080 --> 07:21.840
So now is this space simply connected? To address that question we have to think about

07:21.840 --> 07:26.560
what it means for the curve to teleport like this from one side to the other without breaking.

07:27.520 --> 07:32.160
That means that each point on the left side of the board and the opposite point on the right side

07:32.160 --> 07:38.320
of the board must be literally the same point. So we realize that this space is actually the

07:38.320 --> 07:44.400
surface of a cylinder without the top and bottom circles. And so from that point of view no the

07:44.400 --> 07:50.160
space is not simply connected because in addition to loops that can shrink to a point we also have

07:50.160 --> 07:55.440
the possibility of loops that wrap around the cylinder and those cannot shrink to a point.

07:56.320 --> 08:01.040
Now when we look at those loops on the whiteboard they look like weird teleporting lines not loops.

08:01.840 --> 08:06.160
But when we're looking at the three-dimensional view that really shows the nature of the space

08:06.160 --> 08:11.040
without any cuts and teleports but we see the real space the real for real like how it actually is

08:11.680 --> 08:17.600
then we can see that indeed this is a loop and it cannot be shrunk to a point. By the way here

08:17.600 --> 08:22.320
again it's the same exact situation as before where we can also have different winding numbers

08:22.320 --> 08:28.320
and it turns out that all the homotopy classes of loops on a cylinder can be organized simply by

08:28.320 --> 08:35.200
their winding number. It's not a coincidence that the hole in the whiteboard and the cylinder have

08:35.200 --> 08:40.480
the same set of homotopy classes because if you think about it a whiteboard with a hole in it well

08:40.480 --> 08:46.160
that's a cd and a cd is a lamp shade and a lamp shade is a cylinder so therefore whiteboard with

08:46.160 --> 08:51.760
a hole in it is a cylinder. I love topology. You know the difference between geometry and

08:51.760 --> 08:57.920
topology. In geometry you take your ruler and your protractor and you draw lines and angles and shapes.

08:58.560 --> 09:02.880
In topology you take your ruler and your protractor and you throw them out the window.

09:04.240 --> 09:10.000
Okay so now we know about homotopy simply connected and homotopy class. We also know

09:10.000 --> 09:15.600
that if a space seems like it has teleports from one side to the other this might actually be a

09:15.600 --> 09:21.280
totally continuous space with no teleports but embedded in a higher dimension such that you can

09:21.280 --> 09:26.400
actually pull those points together. Now we're going to apply these concepts to the group of

09:26.400 --> 09:32.240
rotations in three dimensions but first we have to specify what even is the group of rotations in

09:32.240 --> 09:39.360
three dimensions. Let's say we have a cube and let's go ahead and stick a flag in it to make

09:39.360 --> 09:45.120
it really easy to see how the cube is oriented. Now let me ask you this if we rotate this cube

09:45.680 --> 09:50.960
what are all the different ways it can be oriented and how can we represent that set

09:50.960 --> 09:55.600
of all possible orientations? Well there's a couple different ways of going about this and

09:55.600 --> 10:00.960
they're all basically the same but probably the easiest way is to notice that every orientation

10:00.960 --> 10:07.760
can be defined with some axis of rotation and some amount of rotation around that axis and this is

10:07.760 --> 10:14.160
known as the axis angle representation. So what this means is that let's say we have some reference

10:14.240 --> 10:20.400
flag that's say pointing up and in a certain direction then we can get to any other flag

10:20.400 --> 10:27.760
orientation just by rotating the reference flag some amount around some axis. This fact is not

10:27.760 --> 10:33.520
obvious but it is true it follows as a direct consequence of Euler's rotation theorem.

10:36.320 --> 10:42.640
Okay now let's introduce the concept of an axis angle rotation vector so what this vector is

10:42.960 --> 10:50.720
it points in the direction of the axis of rotation and its length is the amount of rotation so here

10:50.720 --> 10:56.400
I'm showing a cube rotating around a single axis and you can see that as the vector grows and shrinks

10:56.400 --> 11:02.560
the cube is rotated more or less around that axis and so if you think about it what is the

11:02.560 --> 11:07.200
space of rotations in three dimensions? If you wanted to categorize everything how can we possibly

11:07.200 --> 11:12.080
come up with some kind of space that encodes every which way a thing can be oriented?

11:13.040 --> 11:17.600
Well it's the space of all directions multiplied by the space of all lengths

11:18.560 --> 11:23.440
but it's a little bit tricky because it's not really the space of all lengths you know if you

11:23.440 --> 11:29.120
rotate 180 degrees around some axis that's the same as rotating 180 around the opposite axis

11:29.840 --> 11:35.440
so actually what you want to imagine is like a sphere where if the vector pokes through the

11:35.440 --> 11:40.880
sphere by the way the sphere has radius of 180 degrees or pi if you want but when it goes

11:40.880 --> 11:45.360
through the sphere then it ends up teleporting to the exact opposite side of the sphere

11:45.360 --> 11:50.400
and it ends up coming back in if you keep rotating it see because what happens here and here we'll

11:50.400 --> 11:55.680
just go along a single axis to make it easy to see but as the vector grows and grows the thing

11:55.680 --> 12:01.680
rotates it gets to 180 and at that point we're going to map its rotation vector onto the opposite

12:01.680 --> 12:06.320
axis 180 and then we're going to keep rotating and that's going to keep coming in and coming in

12:06.320 --> 12:11.200
which is like a lesser and lesser rotation around that opposite axis until finally it ends up back

12:11.200 --> 12:17.600
where it started and so in summary the space of all possible rotations in three dimensions

12:17.600 --> 12:23.040
can be represented as a ball a ball meaning a sphere and also the volume contained within it

12:23.040 --> 12:29.760
of radius 180 degrees where every point on the spherical boundary of the ball is identified with

12:29.760 --> 12:35.520
the exact opposite point such that if you go outside of the sphere you seem to get teleported

12:35.520 --> 12:39.840
back through the other side of the sphere but remember this is not actually a teleport there's

12:39.840 --> 12:45.280
not actually anything discontinuous happening here this apparent teleport is just an artifact of the

12:45.280 --> 12:50.880
way we're drawing this space in reality the space of rotations in three dimensions ironically doesn't

12:50.880 --> 12:56.560
really fit in three dimensions and that's not that weird because if you think about it what we

12:56.560 --> 13:02.240
have here is an abstract space that represents every possible kind of rotation so that's a different

13:02.240 --> 13:07.360
kind of thing than the space that we're rotating within so it's actually not that weird that this

13:07.360 --> 13:12.560
space ends up having this kind of topologically interesting character but a lot of weird things

13:12.560 --> 13:17.440
follow as a consequence of that as we're about to see what i want to show you now is that there

13:17.440 --> 13:23.840
are different kinds of ways to rotate an object back to its original orientation and that seems

13:23.840 --> 13:28.800
weird because you'd think any way you rotate an object back to itself it should all be the same

13:28.880 --> 13:33.520
right there shouldn't really be a meaningful distinction between how you go about doing that

13:33.520 --> 13:39.760
but that's not actually the case so first let's recognize that if we rotate an object back to

13:39.760 --> 13:45.440
its original orientation what that means in our axis angle space is that we're starting with the

13:45.440 --> 13:50.640
zero vector at the origin meaning no rotation then the vector is going to go out and grow in

13:50.640 --> 13:55.920
some direction and it can move around and in general it can do whatever it wants to do it can

13:55.920 --> 14:00.800
teleport if it goes more than 180 whatever the case may be but in order to return to the original

14:00.800 --> 14:07.840
orientation it has to come back to the zero vector so the space of all possible ways to orient an

14:07.840 --> 14:14.240
object back to itself is exactly the space of all possible closed loops in this axis angle

14:14.240 --> 14:20.240
representation there is one caveat here which is that when we look at loops in the axis angle

14:20.240 --> 14:26.160
representation we should think of it only as going around the loop once for reasons that we'll see

14:26.160 --> 14:32.320
in a moment and so what we're gonna do actually tell you what we're gonna take a circular cross

14:32.320 --> 14:38.640
section so not the full three-dimensional ball but actually just a two-dimensional disc now this is

14:38.640 --> 14:43.520
just a slice it's just a cross section but it's easier to look at than the full three-dimensional

14:43.520 --> 14:48.560
thing and what i want to show you about there being different ways of rotating things all of that we

14:48.560 --> 14:54.320
can see by examining this cross section and then we'll see that the same exact concepts easily

14:54.320 --> 14:59.120
generalize into the full three-dimensional space now when we look at these loops i'm also going to

14:59.120 --> 15:04.720
use a color map that winds around the rainbow and then comes back to the starting color and what

15:04.720 --> 15:09.680
that's going to do is that's going to highlight for us the continuity of the loop and in a similar

15:09.680 --> 15:14.880
spirit i'm also going to put a little dot on the loop that just goes around and around and so when

15:14.880 --> 15:19.680
we're looking at teleports the ball is going to help us visualize which parts of the curve are

15:19.680 --> 15:26.160
connected to which other parts of the curve but remember each of these loops only corresponds

15:26.160 --> 15:32.080
to rotating an object once around this particular loop okay and that's important because as we'll

15:32.080 --> 15:36.400
see there's a difference between going around once or twice or three times or four times and so

15:36.400 --> 15:40.800
there are some subtleties there so in our diagram whenever we have a loop think about it as that

15:40.880 --> 15:45.360
represents rotating the object one time around this path in the space of rotations

15:46.400 --> 15:49.920
all right well with all that said let's go ahead and start to explore some of the different

15:49.920 --> 15:57.280
kinds of loops we have in this axis angle space the first kind of loop that we'll look at is

15:57.280 --> 16:03.040
maybe the simplest kind it's just a small loop that stays totally within the boundaries of the

16:03.040 --> 16:09.680
diagram and this corresponds to a wiggle where the cube never rotates more than 180 degrees around

16:09.680 --> 16:14.400
any axis it just sort of wiggles around for a bit and then returns to where it started

16:15.280 --> 16:20.480
as you can imagine this loop is homotopic to any other wiggle that stays within the

16:20.480 --> 16:24.560
boundary and passes through the origin because you can always just imagine stretching it and

16:24.560 --> 16:30.480
shrinking it and exploring the entire homotopy class of wiggles and again these loops can pass

16:30.480 --> 16:33.920
through themselves so we don't have to worry about the question of knots and the different

16:33.920 --> 16:40.560
kinds of knots so aside from wiggles what other homotopy classes might there be well consider

16:40.560 --> 16:47.360
a cube that rotates once along some axis so it does a full 360 that means that its loop is going

16:47.360 --> 16:53.520
to start at the origin and then it's going to go out to 180 degrees then it'll come back in

16:53.520 --> 16:59.760
along the opposite axis and finally it'll return to the origin again having completed a full 360

16:59.840 --> 17:05.840
degree rotation now that's a rotation right that's not just a wiggle that's a full rotation and by

17:05.840 --> 17:10.240
the way if you look at the loop it might not look like a loop it looks more like a weird teleporting

17:10.240 --> 17:16.240
line but remember the cylinder and remember that the apparent teleportation here is just an artifact

17:16.240 --> 17:21.840
of the way we're drawing the space but it doesn't represent any real discontinuity in the space you

17:21.840 --> 17:27.280
have to imagine that the space is curvy in a way that doesn't really fit in the dimensionality

17:27.280 --> 17:32.320
of your screen and so the points that the curve appears to teleport through are actually literally

17:32.320 --> 17:38.560
the same point and in this diagram all pairs of opposite points are literally the same point

17:38.560 --> 17:43.840
now this kind of loop is a genuine rotation i mean look it goes all the way around it's way more

17:43.840 --> 17:50.320
than just a wiggle it's a full 360 and you can see that it can't be reduced to a wiggle because

17:50.320 --> 17:55.440
there's no way of continuously deforming this loop into a loop that doesn't cross the circular

17:55.440 --> 18:01.600
boundary without cutting it okay so then now we have at least two different homotopy classes of

18:01.600 --> 18:08.560
loops in the axis angle space wiggles and full rotations so the space of rotations in three

18:08.560 --> 18:13.840
dimensions is not simply connected which is really surprising right you wouldn't necessarily expect

18:13.840 --> 18:18.880
that but here we can very clearly see that there are at least two totally distinct homotopy classes

18:18.880 --> 18:23.840
of loops in the space of rotations in three dimensions and you know that's just a fundamental

18:23.840 --> 18:29.920
fact of reality all right well this feels similar to the cylinder example where you had loops that

18:29.920 --> 18:34.240
didn't teleport and you also had loops that teleported and then you had like multiple winding

18:34.240 --> 18:40.160
numbers of teleportations and so we might expect to find infinitely many homotopy classes here for

18:40.160 --> 18:45.760
the rotations depending on how many times the loop goes through the boundary but surprisingly

18:45.760 --> 18:52.720
that's not the case there are actually only two different homotopy classes consider for example

18:52.720 --> 18:59.120
the fact that a wiggle is homotopic to an octopus that's gotta be a brand new sentence i don't think

18:59.120 --> 19:05.200
anyone's ever said that you're hearing it first here folks freshly minted sentence okay so the

19:05.200 --> 19:11.280
wiggle crosses the boundary zero times but the octopus crosses many times and yet the two are

19:11.280 --> 19:15.120
totally homotopic as you can see as we're going back and forth between these two you see they're

19:15.120 --> 19:20.320
homotopic it's all continuous transformations here there's no cutting so we don't have one

19:20.320 --> 19:25.200
homotopy class for each winding number like we did with the cylinder because now it's a different

19:25.200 --> 19:30.240
kind of teleporting boundary the boundary is round and has a different geometry and so the

19:30.240 --> 19:35.600
loops can slip around and slip through the boundary and what that ends up doing is it means that you

19:35.600 --> 19:42.240
can always add or subtract two boundary crossings by continuously deforming the loop see for another

19:42.240 --> 19:47.200
example let's say we have a rotation that teleports once and by the way each pair of points here

19:47.200 --> 19:52.080
we're counting as one crossing notice they're the same color they're really the same point

19:52.080 --> 19:55.680
it looks like two points on our diagram but that's an artifact of the way we're drawing a diagram

19:55.680 --> 20:00.640
okay so this is one crossing but you can show that this loop is homotopic to a loop that teleports

20:00.640 --> 20:07.280
multiple times but when you do that with this loop because it started off crossing once you can only

20:07.280 --> 20:13.920
ever get to an odd number of crossings and so as it turns out we only have two homotopy classes

20:14.560 --> 20:18.480
and they're based on whether we have an odd number or an even number of teleports

20:19.360 --> 20:23.760
you can see this by noticing that you can always pull part of the loop through the circular boundary

20:24.320 --> 20:29.680
but when you do so you'll always pull two line segments at a time because we're grabbing onto

20:29.680 --> 20:34.480
a closed loop and that's just how it is and by the way you can see that this argument generalizes

20:34.480 --> 20:40.160
not just to the circular cross section but also to the whole spherical situation because it doesn't

20:40.160 --> 20:44.160
matter whether you're pulling a loop through a circular boundary or a spherical boundary

20:44.160 --> 20:48.160
because either way the loop is going to come through two line segments at a time when you

20:48.160 --> 20:54.000
pull on it so this thing about the two homotopy classes even though we've demonstrated that for

20:54.000 --> 21:00.480
this circular cross section it actually does hold true for the entire space of rotations in three

21:00.480 --> 21:06.400
dimensions oh and here let's go ahead and introduce some terminology so we'll say that a loop is

21:06.400 --> 21:11.920
class one if it has an odd number of teleports and we'll say it's class two if it has an even number

21:12.720 --> 21:15.440
this is easy to remember because one is odd and two is even

21:17.520 --> 21:22.160
you know we've now arrived at a checkpoint like in a video game when you get to a certain level

21:22.160 --> 21:26.800
and your progress is saved you'll want to make sure that you're really comfortable with all of

21:26.800 --> 21:32.080
these ideas discussed so far because we're about to get algebraic and it makes all the

21:32.400 --> 21:37.120
difference in the world if you're able to see and to feel in your soul that the rotations in

21:37.120 --> 21:41.360
three dimensions are not simply connected but actually have two different homotopy classes

21:41.360 --> 21:47.120
of loops i really want to emphasize that this is a fundamental insight a pivotal transformation of

21:47.120 --> 21:52.000
your worldview that you have to go through if you want to study spinners you know even though we

21:52.000 --> 21:56.960
haven't used any equations yet there's a lot to think about here and it may take a while to digest

21:56.960 --> 22:02.320
these ideas i know it took me a while so it's worth meditating on these concepts until they become

22:02.320 --> 22:07.680
second nature because seeing that the rotations aren't simply connected but have rather two

22:07.680 --> 22:12.560
homotopy classes is really the difference between your intuition holding you back and pulling you

22:12.560 --> 22:18.960
forward if you get this concept about two homotopy classes if you really feel it then instinctively

22:18.960 --> 22:23.600
you'll suspect that maybe there might be some mathematical object that is sensitive to the

22:24.080 --> 22:29.280
class of rotations and so it would necessarily have to double cover the space of rotations

22:29.280 --> 22:33.840
and it might not exactly return to itself after a single rotation but instead might pick up some

22:33.840 --> 22:38.480
phase factor that alternates depending on whether it's a class one or a class two and so if you

22:38.480 --> 22:43.040
really get this then your imagination is going to pull you in the direction of spinners you'll

22:43.040 --> 22:47.440
yearn for them even before you've seen what they are and you'll be prepared and excited when it

22:47.440 --> 22:56.960
comes time to actually write an equation all right let's get algebraic so we have this idea

22:56.960 --> 23:03.760
of an axis angle representation of a rotation and now the question is how do we actually work

23:03.760 --> 23:10.080
with this what do we do with this let's say we have some rotation vector and we want to say okay

23:10.080 --> 23:16.160
i want to rotate an object in accordance with that axis angle vector what equation do i write

23:16.160 --> 23:20.560
what code do i put in the computer what do i do and i want to tell you about two different

23:20.560 --> 23:27.520
ways of rotating an object the vector way and the spinner way so i want to focus on the vector way

23:27.520 --> 23:33.280
first and this involves rotation matrices and then later i'll talk about the spinner way and this

23:33.280 --> 23:41.200
involves su2 matrices so starting with the vector way of rotating things um actually you know what

23:41.280 --> 23:46.560
here first we're going to go into two dimensions i'll show you how to rotate vectors i'll show

23:46.560 --> 23:51.520
you the implications for this vis-a-vis rotating objects and then we'll expand up into three

23:51.520 --> 23:55.440
dimensions but i'll use the two dimensions as an example to lay out some of the mathematical

23:55.440 --> 24:01.520
framework all right so imagine we're in a two-dimensional space and we have a unit vector

24:01.520 --> 24:06.960
pointing along the x-axis and you know a unit vector along the x-axis is kind of the simplest

24:06.960 --> 24:11.920
thing you can put in a vector space so we're going to use that as our reference object because

24:11.920 --> 24:17.440
you know no need to over complicate it now in order to rotate this vector what we can do is we

24:17.440 --> 24:24.080
can construct something called a rotation matrix in two dimensions the rotation matrix about some

24:24.080 --> 24:32.320
counterclockwise angle theta has the form cosine of theta negative sine theta sine of theta cosine

24:32.320 --> 24:38.800
of theta and if you investigate the properties of this matrix you'll find two things first the

24:38.800 --> 24:44.800
inverse of the matrix is the transpose of the matrix so if you transpose the matrix and if you

24:44.800 --> 24:49.360
take the inverse that's the same thing and another way of writing that is that the matrix times the

24:49.360 --> 24:55.200
transpose equals the identity matrix so that's the first thing and that means that the matrix is

24:55.200 --> 25:02.720
orthogonal so in the inverse of a matrix equals its transpose that is an orthogonal matrix and

25:02.720 --> 25:08.800
another thing we can see by inspection is that this matrix has determinant one because you know

25:08.800 --> 25:14.000
cosine squared plus sine squared is one so our matrix is orthogonal and it has determinant one

25:14.000 --> 25:19.520
and so the fancy word for that is it is a special orthogonal matrix in particular it's a special

25:19.520 --> 25:26.000
orthogonal two by two matrix and so what we say is it is an s o two matrix so a rotation matrix in

25:26.000 --> 25:31.840
two dimensions is also known as an s o two matrix oh by the way even though we're talking about s o

25:31.840 --> 25:39.280
two in terms of matrices the term s o two can also refer to the group of rotations in two dimensions

25:39.280 --> 25:45.360
in a more general sense whether or not we use matrices to represent them for example instead

25:45.360 --> 25:51.280
we could represent 2d rotations with unit complex numbers and complex multiplication

25:51.280 --> 25:56.240
because the group of e to the i theta's under complex multiplication is isomorphic to the group

25:56.240 --> 26:01.200
of s o two matrices under matrix multiplication and that's a neat little connection there between

26:01.200 --> 26:05.440
the complex numbers and the s o two matrices we'll see in a moment that there's a similar

26:05.440 --> 26:11.120
connection between the quaternions and vsu two matrices but more on that later but for now i just

26:11.120 --> 26:15.760
wanted to let you know that there are many equivalent ways to reformulate all of these concepts

26:15.760 --> 26:21.440
but i like the matrix representation because it's very mechanical and transparent now if we

26:21.440 --> 26:29.040
look at this blue thing swinging around we realize that we can use the set of all rotated blue vectors

26:29.040 --> 26:36.960
to visualize the set of all s o two matrices because if we define the unit vector along x

26:36.960 --> 26:45.040
as a reference vector then each s o two rotation matrix corresponds to one and only one rotated

26:45.040 --> 26:51.520
unit vector so if you tell me hey here's a reference vector and now here's a rotated vector

26:51.520 --> 26:56.880
then by looking at how rotated the rotated vector is i can figure out what s o two matrix was

26:56.880 --> 27:02.080
responsible for the rotation likewise if you give me an s o two matrix and a reference vector

27:02.080 --> 27:06.400
then i can draw you the rotated vector so there's a one-to-one correspondence here

27:06.960 --> 27:12.000
and this is true regardless of what reference vector we pick no matter its length or orientation

27:12.000 --> 27:15.600
which you can prove to yourself by skeptically tilting your head and leaning back

27:16.960 --> 27:22.560
so anyway we can see that we can loop through the s o two matrices in a periodic way passing

27:22.560 --> 27:27.040
through each of them in order of increasing angle and then ending up back where we started

27:27.760 --> 27:33.920
and so we can see that the topology of s o two is just a circle and that's why s o two is also

27:33.920 --> 27:40.800
called the circle group so in two dimensions we can represent an s o two matrix in other words

27:40.800 --> 27:47.520
a rotation with just a vector but when we go to three dimensions because of the extra degree of

27:47.520 --> 27:53.440
freedom uh we're gonna have to use a flag and the reason we're using a flag is because if you

27:53.440 --> 27:58.480
just had a vector in three dimensions then that kind of points in a certain direction but then

27:58.480 --> 28:04.400
there's the question of how is the vector rotated along its axis and so with a flag we can see that

28:04.400 --> 28:09.600
flag rotation angle and so we can use that to represent the rotations in three dimensions but

28:09.600 --> 28:14.480
before we get into three dimensions i want to show you how to rotate a flag in two dimensions

28:14.480 --> 28:20.240
and basically the way to do it is just imagine the vector that points from the origin to each

28:20.240 --> 28:25.600
of the interesting points on the flag so the zero vector points to the flagpole base then you

28:25.600 --> 28:30.080
have a vector that points to the top of the flagpole a couple of vectors that point out to the sides

28:30.080 --> 28:34.320
of the flag and then another vector that points along the flagpole to the point where the flag

28:34.320 --> 28:39.920
meets the flagpole so basically we just treat those five points as vectors and you apply a

28:39.920 --> 28:45.840
rotation matrix to those vectors and as it turns out the whole pattern of the flag will rotate

28:45.840 --> 28:51.280
when you do this and that's because rotation matrices preserve the relative lengths and

28:51.280 --> 28:56.880
angles of vectors that they're transforming and so any lines drawn between two vectors which is

28:56.880 --> 29:01.520
also the difference of those two vectors will transform in the same way as all of the other

29:01.520 --> 29:07.680
vectors now here's a view where we offset the flag from the origin so here this really drives

29:07.680 --> 29:12.400
the point home that if you have some shape made out of vectors and you rotate all the vectors

29:12.480 --> 29:17.760
you end up rotating the shape there's a couple of other concepts I wanted to touch on while we're

29:17.760 --> 29:24.720
here for example what would happen if we scaled up our rotation matrix so that its determinant

29:24.720 --> 29:30.000
were greater than one well now it would no longer be a special orthogonal matrix but it would still

29:30.000 --> 29:35.280
be a matrix and it would still transform a vector field and as you can see from this animation if

29:35.280 --> 29:40.480
we take a rotation matrix and scale it up so that its determinant is greater than one then that's

29:40.560 --> 29:46.800
just going to expand all of the vectors likewise if we scale down a rotation matrix so that its

29:46.800 --> 29:51.520
determinant becomes less than one then that's going to shrink the vectors and the reason I

29:51.520 --> 29:56.800
bring this up is so that you can see the connection between a matrix having determinant one and a

29:56.800 --> 30:01.600
matrix doing a rotation transform because with a rotation we don't want to expand or shrink

30:01.600 --> 30:05.760
vectors we want to keep them the same length and by the way when you're transforming a vector space

30:05.760 --> 30:11.600
with a matrix it's not always a uniform expansion or contraction sometimes you can also get a skew

30:11.600 --> 30:18.560
and a matrix that skews a vector space is not an orthogonal matrix because it doesn't preserve the

30:18.560 --> 30:22.720
relative lengths and angles of the vector field you know it squishes them and so anyway that's

30:22.720 --> 30:28.080
another reason why we want to use a special orthogonal matrix for rotations because they

30:28.080 --> 30:34.480
don't skew the vector field oh and also if we go ahead and allow the determinant to go negative

30:34.560 --> 30:39.600
you can see that an inversion of the vector field happens and by the way I know this looks

30:39.600 --> 30:44.480
kind of three-dimensional but it's actually two-dimensional and it's getting squished along

30:44.480 --> 30:49.520
one axis until it flips around and goes out on the other axis while at the same time I'm rotating it

30:49.520 --> 30:53.360
but anyway the main thing I wanted to show you there is that an inversion can happen when the

30:53.360 --> 30:59.520
determinant goes negative so I hope these examples of growing and shrinking and skewing and inverting

30:59.520 --> 31:05.680
vectors gives you some sense of why we want to use special orthogonal matrices to do rotations

31:08.320 --> 31:14.240
okay so now that we're experts on SO2 and rotations in two dimensions we'll go ahead and

31:14.240 --> 31:20.720
pop up into the third dimension a lot of what we just talked about in 2d will transfer directly

31:20.720 --> 31:27.120
over to 3d but of course now we're in an expanded environment so some of the concepts will be adjusted

31:27.120 --> 31:33.760
accordingly but something I want to emphasize is that all of this special orthogonal terminology

31:33.760 --> 31:39.440
gives us a precise way to describe what kinds of matrices we're looking for regardless of the

31:39.440 --> 31:46.320
dimensionality of the space that we're in because all of the same intuitions apply in 3d as in 2d

31:46.320 --> 31:51.920
about not wanting to grow the vectors or shrink or skew or invert anything and so what we're

31:51.920 --> 32:00.240
looking for now are SO3 matrices that is special orthogonal 3x3 matrices where the same constraints

32:00.240 --> 32:05.760
apply about the inverse being the transpose and the determinant being 1 but now there's just an

32:05.760 --> 32:13.280
additional dimension and so the essence of special orthogonality is the essence of rotation and yes

32:13.280 --> 32:19.520
by the way this also applies in higher dimensions but save our tears for another day so anyway

32:19.600 --> 32:26.400
earlier we saw that given some rotation angle theta we can construct the 2d rotation matrix as

32:26.400 --> 32:33.360
cosine negative sine sine cosine but now in three dimensions instead of just an angle for the rotation

32:33.920 --> 32:39.680
we now have an axis angle vector like we talked about earlier and so we're faced with the question

32:39.680 --> 32:47.440
of how do we write the SO3 matrix that goes with any particular axis angle vector this is actually

32:47.440 --> 32:53.760
quite a difficult problem but don't worry it was solved in 1840 by Alinde Rodriguez and the

32:53.760 --> 33:00.000
solution is called the Rodriguez formula the Rodriguez formula is just a recipe for converting

33:00.000 --> 33:06.400
an axis angle vector into the SO3 matrix that does that rotation so you take an axis angle vector

33:06.400 --> 33:11.520
put it into the Rodriguez formula and out pops your SO3 matrix and then you take that SO3 matrix

33:11.520 --> 33:15.760
you just slap it onto a vector and it rotates the vector and that's how that works that's how

33:15.760 --> 33:22.000
you rotate vectors in 3d it's pretty neat so in theory in principle according to everyone's

33:22.000 --> 33:28.080
intuition and imagination that should be good enough if we want to represent rotating any object

33:28.080 --> 33:33.120
you should totally be able to just list out a bunch of position vectors of points on the object

33:33.120 --> 33:37.440
rotate all your position vectors with special orthogonal matrices and then that should be

33:37.440 --> 33:43.440
like all you need to rotate things in math and physics like you should only ever have

33:43.440 --> 33:47.680
special orthogonal matrices for rotations like we have it already it's good enough right this is

33:47.680 --> 33:55.440
fine well not exactly we got to talk about SU2 SU2 I don't even know where to begin with SU2

33:55.440 --> 34:02.320
well here how about this we'll start off by thinking about SU2 as a complex generalization

34:02.320 --> 34:10.320
of SO2 let me clarify what I mean by that so think about an SO2 matrix as we've seen you

34:10.320 --> 34:17.280
can write an SO2 matrix as cosine theta minus sine sine cosine or equivalently we can say that the

34:17.280 --> 34:26.080
general form of an SO2 matrix is a negative b b a with the constraint that a squared plus b squared

34:26.080 --> 34:32.800
equals one and you can see that this is the same thing by the substitution a is cosine of theta

34:32.800 --> 34:39.200
and b is sine theta and when you write it in terms of a and b and a squared plus b squared equals one

34:39.280 --> 34:45.760
you see that we have a unit circle of possible SO2 matrices okay now with that in mind let's

34:45.760 --> 34:53.920
look at the definition of an SU2 matrix so an SU2 matrix involves complex elements we'll

34:53.920 --> 35:01.280
symbolize them as alpha and beta and it has the form alpha negative beta conjugate beta alpha

35:01.280 --> 35:07.840
conjugate where alpha and beta are complex numbers and the magnitude of alpha squared plus the

35:07.840 --> 35:14.240
magnitude of beta squared equals one you can see that in the special case that alpha and beta are

35:14.240 --> 35:21.680
real numbers then this matrix has the form of an SO2 matrix but because alpha and beta can be complex

35:21.680 --> 35:28.720
numbers SU2 is actually a more general kind of matrix than an SO2 matrix it has more degrees of

35:28.720 --> 35:38.080
freedom and whereas an SO2 matrix acts on real valued two component vectors an SU2 matrix being

35:38.080 --> 35:46.400
complex naturally is going to act on complex valued two component vectors those complex valued two

35:46.400 --> 35:52.880
component vectors are called spinners and this is one way of thinking about what a spinner is

35:53.520 --> 35:59.680
it's the vector like thing that an SU2 matrix acts upon by the way there are ways of generalizing

35:59.680 --> 36:03.360
the concept of spinners using other kinds of matrices but i'm not going to worry about that

36:03.360 --> 36:07.840
today today we're just focused on two component complex spinners which are the most common kind

36:07.840 --> 36:13.360
of spinner you'll encounter in physics okay now something you can see by exploring the properties

36:13.360 --> 36:21.520
of these SU2 matrices is that they have determinant one and that the inverse of the matrix is the

36:21.600 --> 36:28.000
complex conjugate transpose of the matrix so this is very very similar to a special orthogonal

36:28.000 --> 36:35.200
matrix but technically the correct word now is special unitary matrix where unitary refers to

36:35.200 --> 36:41.200
the fact that the inverse of the matrix is the complex conjugate transpose of the matrix and

36:41.200 --> 36:46.640
that complex conjugation comes in because the dot product of two complex vectors involves a complex

36:46.640 --> 36:51.280
conjugation and so in order to preserve lengths and angles between complex vectors we have to

36:51.280 --> 36:57.040
preserve the dot product and so there's a complex conjugation that comes in in order to preserve

36:57.040 --> 37:01.200
dot products but anyway i'm not going to go into too much detail on that just know that these are

37:01.200 --> 37:09.200
the constraints on SU2 matrices okay so what we've looked at so far is a very algebraic definition

37:09.200 --> 37:15.040
of SU2 and what we should look at now is the picture of what do these matrices actually do

37:15.920 --> 37:21.200
so the way to do that is to first draw some reference spinner and this will be analogous to

37:21.200 --> 37:26.880
the reference vector we looked at when we looked at SU2 and then we're going to multiply it by an

37:26.880 --> 37:33.680
SU2 matrix and we're going to see how it transforms so first of all how should we even draw a two

37:33.680 --> 37:38.400
component complex vector well there's a lot of different ways of drawing it but today i'm just

37:38.400 --> 37:43.760
going to keep it simple we're going to look at one complex plane and then i'll put two dots in the

37:43.760 --> 37:50.000
plane corresponding to the two components of the complex vector and i'll draw a line between them

37:50.000 --> 37:55.680
just to highlight the point that these two dots are actually two parts of the same object there's

37:55.680 --> 37:59.280
another way of looking at all this math in four dimensions but we're not going to get into that

37:59.280 --> 38:07.360
today anyway so when we multiply our reference spinner by SU2 matrices we can see that it kind

38:07.360 --> 38:15.680
of goes around and it it spins and it transforms in this rotational kind of way and so naturally

38:15.680 --> 38:21.760
we can ask the question of what are the degrees of freedom here as we're transforming our spinner

38:21.760 --> 38:26.320
how does it evolve and how many degrees of freedom does it have well naively it should

38:26.320 --> 38:30.800
have four degrees of freedom right because there is two complex numbers and each complex number

38:30.800 --> 38:36.480
has two degrees of freedom in the complex plane but we're going to take out a degree of freedom

38:36.480 --> 38:42.400
by virtue of the fact that the su2 matrix has determinant one and is unitary and so what that

38:42.400 --> 38:48.000
means is that this spinner is not changing in size and that means that the magnitude squared of the

38:48.000 --> 38:52.320
first component plus the magnitude squared of the second component is always going to equal one

38:52.880 --> 38:58.640
so we actually have three degrees of freedom here and these three degrees of freedom are isomorphic

38:58.640 --> 39:03.600
to the hypersphere which is the locus of points in four dimensions that are all equidistant from

39:03.600 --> 39:07.760
the origin which you can see when you think about it right you start off with four pure

39:07.760 --> 39:12.240
degrees of freedom and then constrain them so that they have to be constant size what you

39:12.240 --> 39:18.000
end up with is a hypersphere interestingly the hypersphere is a simply connected space that'll

39:18.000 --> 39:24.640
be really important later but for now just think of these spinners as rotating around spinning around

39:24.960 --> 39:31.920
in a way that is simply connected okay so here we have three degrees of freedom

39:32.960 --> 39:39.280
and it involves some kind of spinny rotating thing so the question arises does this have any

39:39.280 --> 39:45.440
connection to s03 that is the three-dimensional rotations maybe it will maybe it won't right i

39:45.440 --> 39:48.480
mean if we're just thinking about it from a mathematical perspective that's a legitimate

39:48.480 --> 39:54.160
question to ask and as it turns out shockingly there is a very very close connection between

39:54.160 --> 40:02.000
s02 and s03 and in particular s02 double covers s03 let me explain what that means

40:02.720 --> 40:08.720
so imagine we have s03 which acts on some three-dimensional vector and rotates it

40:10.080 --> 40:15.360
and we also have s02 which is going to act on some two-component complex vector that we call a

40:15.360 --> 40:21.120
spinner and it's going to transform it and kind of spin it around what the double cover means is

40:21.120 --> 40:28.400
that we can draw a connection between any possible rotation in three dimensions and any possible

40:28.400 --> 40:33.680
s02 transformation on these spinners in this two complex dimensional space

40:35.280 --> 40:42.160
but the connection is not one to one it's actually two to one for every rotation in three dimensions

40:42.160 --> 40:50.240
we have precisely two possible s02 transformations and moreover those two s02 transformations

40:50.240 --> 40:55.760
are related to each other in that they only differ by a minus sign so you know at the beginning of

40:55.760 --> 41:00.400
the video i mentioned that quote by michael atia where he was talking about how spinners are in

41:00.400 --> 41:06.480
some sense the square root of geometry and you really see this in the way that s02 double covers

41:06.480 --> 41:11.680
s03 because if you think about it what is the square root of four well it's two but it's also

41:11.680 --> 41:17.680
negative two and what is the square root of nine well it's three but it's also negative three so

41:17.680 --> 41:22.000
when you take the square root of something you get an answer but you actually get two answers

41:22.000 --> 41:28.240
that differ only by a minus sign likewise if you look at any rotation in three dimensions

41:28.240 --> 41:34.480
which corresponds to a single s03 element and you ask what is the corresponding s02 element

41:35.360 --> 41:40.160
you get an answer but you actually get two answers that are related by a minus sign

41:40.560 --> 41:48.160
okay now let's talk about the spinner way of rotating things so because s02

41:48.160 --> 41:54.480
double covers s03 there's an intimate connection between every s02 transformation

41:55.200 --> 42:01.680
and every rotation in three-dimensional space therefore if we wanted to we could mathematically

42:01.680 --> 42:08.560
deal with rotations using the framework of s02 matrices instead of s03 but we would just have

42:08.640 --> 42:13.120
to ignore the redundancy that comes with a double cover but that's not really a problem I mean we

42:13.120 --> 42:17.280
can literally just ignore the redundancy right we can just project it out let me give you an

42:17.280 --> 42:23.600
analogy so suppose that there is a math problem and you have some computer program that calculates

42:23.600 --> 42:29.280
the answer but it's kind of slow and it takes a while to run so you run your program you wait a

42:29.280 --> 42:35.120
moment while it calculates and then let's say you see that the answer is four well okay if you're

42:35.120 --> 42:40.960
not in a rush that method works fine but let's say you're really in a hurry or maybe you have to do

42:40.960 --> 42:46.720
a bunch of these calculations super fast so you look for a way to do it faster and then you discover

42:46.720 --> 42:52.400
a faster method but the catch is that it doesn't give you the answer but instead it gives you the

42:52.400 --> 42:58.720
square root of the answer so if the answer is four then sometimes the fast method gives you two

42:58.720 --> 43:03.520
and sometimes it gives you negative two okay fine that's actually not a problem at all because you

43:03.520 --> 43:09.040
can just square it and the ambiguity washes out and you've got your answer the same reasoning

43:09.040 --> 43:15.520
applies to using su2 to do rotations because it turns out that su2 lends itself to faster

43:15.520 --> 43:21.200
more numerically stable calculations than so3 and even though there are two possible spinners

43:21.200 --> 43:27.200
for each so3 orientation they only differ by a minus sign which can easily be washed away

43:28.080 --> 43:33.200
don't get me wrong so3 is pretty fast too I mean I used like a million so3 matrices while

43:33.200 --> 43:38.800
making this video but then again I also rendered these animations overnight I wasn't in a hurry so

43:38.800 --> 43:43.440
I just took the easier route in terms of thinking about so3 and axis angle vectors and Rodriguez

43:43.440 --> 43:49.280
formula and that worked fine the only time I really had to use su2 for 3d rotations is when

43:49.280 --> 43:54.400
making these colored flag animations those are actually based on su2 because I wanted it to

43:54.400 --> 44:00.080
match the spinners anyway with animations there's not really a time constraint so you might as well

44:00.080 --> 44:05.920
just think in terms of axis angle vectors Rodriguez formula so3 rotation matrices because it's easier

44:05.920 --> 44:11.440
on the brain and usually there's no benefit to rotating a vector like a microsecond faster so

44:11.440 --> 44:16.960
why torture yourself if you don't have to but if you are writing software for video game graphics

44:16.960 --> 44:22.480
or a vision system for a self-driving car or the attitude control system for a rocket then you'll

44:22.480 --> 44:27.360
for sure want to use su2 because in those cases you're going to have to rotate a lot of vectors

44:27.360 --> 44:32.400
very quickly and the only cost of using su2 is that it's harder to think about when you're

44:32.400 --> 44:38.800
writing the code because your imagination has to roll around on a hypersphere and it's kind of dizzying

44:38.800 --> 44:44.160
but at the end of the day you'll end up with a code that's faster uses less ram and is more zen

44:44.160 --> 44:51.840
than a code that uses so3 the numbers flow more gracefully when you use su2 su2 also lets you

44:51.840 --> 44:58.160
avoid the problem of gimbal lock which affects so3 i don't have time to go into it today but google

44:58.160 --> 45:06.880
Apollo 11 gimbal lock for a cautionary tale about the perils of so3 also when using su2 for

45:06.880 --> 45:12.480
rotations in three dimensions people often use the quaternion representation because it's clean

45:12.480 --> 45:19.040
and simple we saw earlier that there's an isomorphism between so2 and the unit complex numbers

45:20.000 --> 45:26.880
and similarly there's an isomorphism between su2 and the unit quaternions and by the way this

45:26.880 --> 45:32.800
isomorphism makes manifest the hyperspherical topology of su2 so anyway whenever you hear people

45:32.800 --> 45:38.320
talking about a rotation algorithm that uses su2 or spinners or quaternions it's all the same

45:39.040 --> 45:43.280
the basic idea is that you're doing your rotational math in this weird simply connected

45:43.280 --> 45:48.080
hyperspherical kind of redundant group that somehow lives like kind of underneath the vector

45:48.080 --> 45:54.560
rotations it's uh it's very bizarre but it works somehow it works and so su2 is actually used

45:54.560 --> 46:00.320
ubiquitously in applications that demand maximum performance and so su2 is more than just some

46:00.320 --> 46:05.280
fanciful abstraction it's actually very practical and you know it'd be one thing if it were just

46:05.280 --> 46:10.400
practical it'd be one thing if su2 was just like a more efficient way to do rotations and you just

46:10.400 --> 46:15.760
ignore the spinner phase fine i mean okay that's cool but that's not particularly profound but

46:15.840 --> 46:20.080
the thing that's really a trip is that in theoretical physics the spinner phase actually

46:20.080 --> 46:26.320
matters so su2 is not just another way of doing rotations but that redundancy that you wash out

46:26.320 --> 46:30.960
if you're just doing like video game graphics that actually is something that's relevant to the

46:30.960 --> 46:35.920
wave function of a relativistic electron for example and as we'll see later in the video

46:35.920 --> 46:42.240
that is a very very deep mystery as to why that's the case okay so let's look at one more double

46:42.240 --> 46:48.240
cover animation and then we'll talk about the physical mystery of spinners so here we have a

46:48.240 --> 46:56.160
very very complicated rotational path and it's all like and it's all like swooping around and doing

46:56.160 --> 47:02.080
all these moves and the point i want to illustrate here is that even when the rotational path is

47:02.080 --> 47:08.960
super complicated there's still this connection between the flag rotating an so3 and the spinner

47:08.960 --> 47:14.480
rotating with an su2 matrix there's still that two to one connection such that if we go around

47:14.480 --> 47:19.360
a class one curve we end up with the phase switched then if we run that class one curve again

47:19.360 --> 47:22.800
bring it full circle we end up doing a class two and we end up back to where we started

47:23.600 --> 47:29.760
so let's take a closer look at this and we can see exactly how that happens okay so first it comes

47:29.760 --> 47:35.200
in it's like shoo shoo and then look it's about to teleport right there do you see that okay cool

47:35.280 --> 47:41.280
let's keep it going now it comes around and look we'll pause here okay now it's come back to where

47:41.280 --> 47:46.080
it started but the phase is reversed as indicated by the fact that the flag is red and also if you

47:46.080 --> 47:50.240
look at the plot you can see that the spinner is the negative of what we started out with

47:51.200 --> 47:55.760
all right and continuing it's going to swoop around and it's going to teleport right now

47:56.640 --> 48:00.800
and it's going to come back through and it'll end up back where it started so we've done two

48:00.800 --> 48:06.160
class ones and that's a class two and that brings us back to the starting point isn't this neat I

48:06.160 --> 48:12.960
think it's neat the thing I really want to impress upon you is that su2 double covers s03 and it's

48:12.960 --> 48:18.560
like a perfect double cover it's like a hand in the glove or like I guess a hand in two gloves you

48:18.560 --> 48:24.080
know so like that's really cool you know like what what does that mean right I mean the algebra I

48:24.080 --> 48:27.600
think as you can see the algebra is formally understood I mean look at all the numbers on the

48:27.600 --> 48:31.840
screen if you pause it at any moment in time you can check for yourself the matrices are right

48:31.840 --> 48:38.400
and you know all the equations we've looked at that's all true it's all good but why like what

48:38.400 --> 48:44.160
does this mean you know the funny thing is when making these videos the equations are the easy

48:44.160 --> 48:50.160
part because an equation is just a recipe and I can put it in the computer and make an animation

48:50.160 --> 48:55.920
and I can just tell you how it is and how it works the hard part is conveying the sense of mystery

48:56.560 --> 49:00.640
I mean aside from the fact that it's just kind of confusing and like whoa what are these things

49:00.640 --> 49:05.520
but how can I share with you that sense of awe and wonder that so many people have when they work

49:05.520 --> 49:10.000
with spinners especially in the context of physics and you know that's much more of a storytelling

49:10.000 --> 49:15.600
problem that's the objective there is to really share a state of mind or an attitude and so I

49:15.600 --> 49:19.600
just want to tell you about it from my point of view so please take everything I'm about to say

49:19.600 --> 49:24.160
with a grain of salt this is just my perspective but I hope it resonates with you as well

49:25.920 --> 49:32.000
okay so you might have heard of the five stages of grief well I like to think that there's a

49:32.000 --> 49:38.320
similar five stages that you go through when learning about spinners uh hear me out so except

49:38.320 --> 49:44.720
it's not as bad instead of anger it's astonishment and instead of depression it's existential shock

49:46.080 --> 49:50.800
now I don't think anyone's ever gotten to the fifth stage but I can tell you about the first four

49:51.520 --> 49:56.240
so starting off with the denial stage if you tell someone that there's something that you have to

49:56.240 --> 50:00.800
rotate it twice to get back to where it started they're just gonna tell you no you're wrong like

50:00.800 --> 50:05.600
that can't be like have you ever rotated an object everyone knows all you need is to do a 360

50:05.600 --> 50:10.320
rotation in any axis and then you get back to where you started this is like a basic fact of

50:10.320 --> 50:16.480
reality and look I get it I mean I understand I've rotated objects too I've actually personally

50:16.480 --> 50:21.360
rotated back in the days when I used to jump out of planes I spent a lot of time rotating

50:21.360 --> 50:26.720
atmospherically so I'm not naive when it comes to rotations I've been around a time or two

50:27.680 --> 50:32.080
sorry I couldn't resist the pun anyway if there's one thing that I know and you know and everyone

50:32.080 --> 50:37.440
knows it's that a rotation of 360 degrees is all you need to get back to where you started

50:37.440 --> 50:42.160
you don't need a 720 rotation so what is this spinner stuff it makes no sense so that's the

50:42.240 --> 50:48.080
denial stage and what breaks you out of the denial stage is when you become really familiar with

50:48.080 --> 50:55.200
the math so when you get to know so3 and su2 and you see that su2 double covers so3 you see that

50:55.200 --> 51:01.280
so3 is not simply connected but su2 is and so now you have two different ways of looking at rotations

51:01.280 --> 51:05.440
and one of them is kind of more elegant but in some sense more redundant than the other and it's

51:05.440 --> 51:10.480
sort of like okay there's something here now when you become familiar with the math it's very

51:10.480 --> 51:16.640
astonishing so I like to call this the astonishment phase and this is when you might be very curious

51:16.640 --> 51:20.800
about the math and you might study it a lot more you might explore it you might write some Python

51:20.800 --> 51:25.680
codes you might investigate every which way you can rotate these different things and you might make

51:25.680 --> 51:31.040
pretty plots and it's very wonderful and beautiful and you find that there's a very rich structure

51:31.040 --> 51:36.080
here that you can spend a lot of time exploring and after having done that there's no way that you

51:36.080 --> 51:42.560
can go back to the denial stage but even still you feel the need to contextualize the math you feel

51:42.560 --> 51:47.520
the need to say okay but what does it all mean and how literally should I take it and what are the

51:47.520 --> 51:53.680
physical implications if any and the part of you in your heart is not going to want there to be any

51:53.680 --> 51:58.560
physical implications I mean you want to think it's just the product of a mathematician's overactive

51:58.560 --> 52:02.480
imagination you don't want to think there's anything in the world that actually does have

52:02.480 --> 52:07.440
to rotate twice to get back to where it started because that's deeply unsettling and so we enter

52:07.440 --> 52:12.800
into the bargaining stage where we say okay fine mathematically sure yeah spinners are a thing but

52:12.800 --> 52:18.800
it's not physics this isn't real this isn't like tangible and so you can sort of argue the math

52:18.800 --> 52:23.360
and physics and say no it's just a useful fiction it's just the structure of the equations but it

52:23.360 --> 52:28.880
doesn't have any physical implications and the problem is that is a losing battle because the

52:28.880 --> 52:34.480
more you learn physics the more prominent and essential spinners become you know for example

52:34.480 --> 52:38.960
look at the Dirac equation look at the wave function of an electron it's a bi-spinner field

52:38.960 --> 52:44.160
and it's this thing that's written in terms of spinners and it's at the heart of quantum physics

52:45.120 --> 52:49.440
so okay but you still want to bargain some more you still want to say well our understanding of

52:49.440 --> 52:54.320
physics is incomplete and so the Dirac equation maybe there's a way of writing it without spinners

52:54.960 --> 52:58.800
so you look into geometric algebra and these different ways of writing the Dirac equation

52:58.800 --> 53:03.600
and you find that nope no matter what you always have spinners or something equivalent to spinners

53:04.160 --> 53:08.480
and so then you say okay but maybe the Dirac equation itself is wrong in some sense and then

53:08.480 --> 53:13.600
so okay it's like what is the Dirac equation well it's three ingredients it's Lorenz invariance

53:13.600 --> 53:17.760
it's the quantum mechanical energy momentum operators and it's the requirement that the

53:17.760 --> 53:23.120
equations be first order in space and time now to the first one of those things no one has ever

53:23.120 --> 53:29.280
observed a violation of Lorenz invariance and in my opinion in my lifetime probably no one ever will

53:29.280 --> 53:34.000
now do i think that Lorenz invariance is literally true at every scale no personally i don't but

53:34.000 --> 53:38.880
i also don't think we're ever gonna be observing any deviations from it anytime soon so if you want

53:38.880 --> 53:43.600
to try to undermine the importance of spinners in physics by arguing against Lorenz invariance

53:43.600 --> 53:48.320
it's not gonna work out likewise with the quantum mechanical energy momentum operators

53:48.320 --> 53:52.800
i mean there's really not much room for flexibility here because they describe so

53:52.800 --> 53:56.560
well pretty much like everything i mean you want to look at the black body spectrum you want to

53:56.560 --> 54:01.440
look at like the hydrogen energy levels so you're not going to be doing away with the quantum

54:01.440 --> 54:06.000
mechanical energy momentum operators but if you look at the third ingredient the fact that the

54:06.000 --> 54:11.520
equations have to be first order in space and time here we do have a little bit of leeway because

54:11.520 --> 54:16.480
with the benefit of historical hindsight we can say that dirac was a little bit misguided

54:16.480 --> 54:21.360
in his original approach you know i think it's fair to say that he was right but perhaps for

54:21.360 --> 54:27.440
the wrong reasons or maybe better for reasons that were not fully appreciated or understood at the

54:27.440 --> 54:32.400
time anyway with the development of quantum field theory we now know that you can have

54:32.400 --> 54:37.280
particles that aren't fermions and so there's no reason for us to think that the electron

54:37.280 --> 54:42.080
must be a fermion it just so happens that they are and it just so happens that the way to write

54:42.080 --> 54:45.520
that wave function is to say that it's a first order equation in space and time take the square

54:45.600 --> 54:50.560
to the mashel spinners pop out you know that whole thing so it's right but it's not obvious that

54:50.560 --> 54:57.200
it's like mathematically necessary for an electron to be a fermion aha so the way we're going to

54:57.200 --> 55:03.200
bargain out of having to deal with spinners is to say that the electron is not actually a fermion

55:03.200 --> 55:07.600
instead we can just choose to model it as a spinless particle right so instead of a bi-spinner

55:07.600 --> 55:12.160
field we could just use a complex scalar field for its wave function sort of like schrodinger or

55:12.160 --> 55:18.000
Klein-Gordon and there are kind of ways to do that if you're dealing with one electron and are okay

55:18.000 --> 55:22.800
making an approximation but the problem is if you take that approach while you're trying to deal

55:22.800 --> 55:28.080
with multi-electron systems like if we're doing quantum chemistry or condensed matter physics

55:28.080 --> 55:32.400
then that approach doesn't work because we get slapped in the face with something called the

55:32.400 --> 55:37.440
spin statistics theorem and it's such a hard slap that we get knocked out of the bargaining phase

55:37.440 --> 55:43.680
and into the existential shock phase the spin statistics theorem deserves its own video and

55:43.680 --> 55:48.720
actually for now i'll just say there's an excellent book written on it called poly and the spin

55:48.720 --> 55:55.600
statistics theorem by ian duck and ecg sudarshan it's a very interesting book and i highly recommend

55:55.600 --> 56:00.000
it if you want a good overview of the history of this theorem and its profound implications

56:00.000 --> 56:04.800
and what is known about it and what is still not known about it but anyway for today we just have

56:04.880 --> 56:10.960
to know what the theorem says in a nutshell it says that particles with half integer spin are

56:10.960 --> 56:16.800
fermions and their wave function will pick up a minus sign when two particles are exchanged

56:18.080 --> 56:20.720
and that leads into fermi dirac statistics

56:23.760 --> 56:30.160
on the other hand particles with integer spin are bosons and their wave function will remain the

56:30.160 --> 56:37.360
same when two particles are exchanged that leads into bows einstein statistics in short the spin

56:37.360 --> 56:42.960
statistics theorem says that there is a direct and mysterious link between the minus sign or lack

56:42.960 --> 56:50.480
thereof picked up by a particle under 360 degree rotation and the minus sign or lack thereof picked

56:50.480 --> 56:56.320
up by a multi particle wave function under the exchange of any two particles this fact is going

56:56.400 --> 57:01.600
to lead to radically different behavior depending on whether you're dealing with an ensemble of

57:01.600 --> 57:08.240
fermions or an ensemble of bosons bosons don't mind being all up in the same quantum state at the

57:08.240 --> 57:15.360
same time it's all good but fermions will never share the same quantum state they do not like to

57:15.360 --> 57:21.840
be together there's a principle that every high school chemistry student learns called the poly

57:21.920 --> 57:28.000
exclusion principle it says that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state at the same time

57:28.720 --> 57:34.880
this is a profound principle with far-reaching consequences it plays an absolutely fundamental

57:34.880 --> 57:40.160
role in chemistry it's the reason for example that atoms have different orbitals that the electrons

57:40.160 --> 57:44.320
have to stay in you know because you might wonder why isn't it that uh an atom at rest why can't

57:44.320 --> 57:48.480
all the electrons collapse into the ground state together what is it that keeps some of them propped

57:48.480 --> 57:53.120
up into higher energy states well it's the poly exclusion principle you know the lower orbitals

57:53.120 --> 57:58.480
are already filled up so chemistry students take this for granted as sort of one of the axioms of

57:58.480 --> 58:04.320
chemistry but with physics we go a bit deeper and right now we're actually logically one level

58:04.320 --> 58:10.400
underneath the poly exclusion principle because it follows as a consequence of the more fundamental

58:10.400 --> 58:17.840
spin statistics theorem to see this just consider a system of n electrons whose multi particle wave

58:17.840 --> 58:25.600
function can be written as psi is a function of x1 x2 dot dot dot xa dot dot xb dot dot dot xn

58:26.320 --> 58:31.280
where x sub n in this context refers to all the quantum numbers of the nth particle

58:31.280 --> 58:38.800
including spatial coordinates and spin now suppose we switch electrons a and b according to the spin

58:38.800 --> 58:44.960
statistics theorem because electrons are fermions the new wave function is just the minus sign of

58:44.960 --> 58:50.400
the original one so psi of the original quantum numbers is going to equal negative psi of the

58:50.400 --> 58:56.000
same quantum numbers but with the numbers for a and b switched around so all we've done so far is

58:56.000 --> 59:01.280
basically just stated generically what the spin statistics theorem tells us about fermions but

59:01.280 --> 59:07.280
suppose now that we force electrons a and b into the same quantum state with the power of imagination

59:08.000 --> 59:13.520
then by the symmetry of what it means for two things to be the same we conclude that there is no

59:13.520 --> 59:18.880
difference between the original and swapped wave function by definition there can't be if a and

59:18.880 --> 59:23.600
b are the same state then you switch them nothing can change right because they're the same well

59:23.600 --> 59:29.200
now here we have two apparently contradictory things when particles a and b are exchanged

59:29.200 --> 59:34.640
the wave function both does and doesn't pick up a minus sign how can that possibly be because

59:34.640 --> 59:40.160
we're saying that psi has to equal negative psi well that can only be the case if psi is precisely

59:40.160 --> 59:46.480
zero and because psi is a probability amplitude we conclude that it is absolutely impossible

59:46.480 --> 59:52.160
for two fermions to occupy the same quantum state at the same time there is zero probability of that

59:52.160 --> 01:00:00.000
happening and that is the poly exclusion principle notice that this argument does not apply to bosons

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.040
with bosons there's no minus sign picked up under particle exchange and so there's no logical

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:09.760
tension when you put two particles in the same state switch the identical particles around all

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.560
you want it's all good and that's why the poly exclusion principle does not apply to photons

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:19.840
for example photons or bosons and they can share the same quantum state no problem and in fact they

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:25.520
often prefer to do so you can see that the spin statistics theorem is quite profound and plays a

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:31.040
major role in shaping the world all around us but why is it true where does this all important

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:37.120
principle come from well we know that the spin statistics theorem is true every moment is bursting

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:42.480
with an abundance of empirical evidence supporting the theorem as electron orbitals continue to exist

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:48.480
and photons continue to be able to occupy the same state additionally the theorem follows logically

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:53.360
from the assumptions of quantum field theory and it's been proven rigorously in that context

01:00:53.920 --> 01:01:00.080
but despite all that nobody really understands in a geometric or visual way why there is this

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:05.840
mysterious connection between spin and particle exchange if you think you do understand it because

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:11.520
you've seen Feynman's topological argument or some similar intuitive proof read chapter 20 of the

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:17.120
spin statistics book long story short those so-called proofs are actually analogies without

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:23.200
any explanatory power but they are fun to think about okay fine now there is one last battle

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.080
where we try to work our way back into the bargaining phase and that is to say well maybe the spin

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.200
statistics theorem is not actually logically underneath the poly exclusion principle maybe

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.160
it's just some kind of cosmic coincidence so maybe spin doesn't play a fundamentally

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:43.440
consequential role in the spin statistics theorem but instead maybe it just so happens to be that

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:48.000
the particles in our universe that happen to be fermions happen to obey the poly exclusion principle

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.360
whereas bosons do not now this is unlikely but we're really grasping at straws here to try to

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:58.320
retain some semblance of our natural intuition you know we don't want to feel like the world is

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:04.480
much more bizarre than it seems but but it is but anyway the final nail in the coffin is to say okay

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:11.600
look what if we take an electron and we change its spin so that it no longer is a half integer kind

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:18.160
of thing but actually behaves as a boson then if that electron is set free of the poly exclusion

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:23.600
principle we would know that we actually are logically underneath the poly exclusion principle

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:28.800
right now because that experiment would give us a definitive proof that the poly exclusion

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:34.080
principle actually does arise from the spin statistics theorem in a really meaningful way

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:41.920
now it's actually not super easy to convert electrons into bosons but it can be done in

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:47.120
some materials because of the way electrons mutually interact with the crystal lattice

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:52.720
you can occasionally get a spin up electron pairing up with a spin down electron and that pair of

01:02:52.720 --> 01:03:00.480
electrons has a net spin of zero and so the pair of electrons is collectively a bosonic entity

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:07.680
so in the material you can have a great many of these and they're able to condense into something

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:13.440
that's spiritually very similar to a boson stein condensate and they genuinely are occupying the

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:18.240
same state at the same time which electrons hardly ever do but when you convert them to bosons all

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:22.560
we're doing is modifying their spin we're not changing their charge we're not taking away any

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:27.600
mass or any of that we're just pairing them up so the spin cancels out and now we set them free

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:32.640
from the poly exclusion principle they condense into a very low energy state and can slip through a

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:38.240
material like a ghost without interacting with the atoms along the way and this is the phenomenon

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:44.160
of superconductivity and so superconductivity gives us an undeniable proof that the spin

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:49.440
statistics theorem is genuinely underneath the poly exclusion principle by the way we'll have a

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:54.720
lot more to say in the future about superconductivity it is an incredible phenomenon and you know i've

01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:00.800
personally seen what a superconductor can do my colleagues and i have sent enormous electrical

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:06.560
currents through superconductors many thousands of times the intensity that would melt copper

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:12.640
and i've watched it stay cool as a cucumber it doesn't heat up at all because all that current

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:17.280
is being carried by these superelectrons that are behaving as bosons and so it's not even like

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:22.320
regular physics like we know and love it it's like this weird surreal like crazy version of

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.480
reality where the poly exclusion principle only you know doesn't always apply to every electron

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.520
i think it's amazing it's a wonderful thing so we'll talk about that a lot in the future we'll

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.160
get into uh ginsberg landau and flux quantization and all that good stuff but anyway today i just

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.920
bring it up to highlight that this whole spinner thing you know it's real it's mysterious and if

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:44.720
you take away the spinner nature of the electrons wave function you get some pretty bizarre and

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:50.080
surreal effects that actually are real this is not just theory this is not just socrates

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:55.520
philosophies and hypotheses no this is like real like technology like engineering people are building

01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:02.160
devices with this stuff so you know so that's something to think about anyway is it possible

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:07.520
to reach the acceptance stage and to really understand spinners in a way that would satisfy

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:14.800
even michael atia maybe but we're not there yet among other things the lack of an intuitive but

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:20.800
rigorous proof of the spin statistics theorem shows that we don't fully understand the significance

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:26.240
of spinners in physical reality we're aware of spinners we're able to work with them we know

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:31.680
how their algebra works but we still do not know why spinner valued wave functions are anti symmetric

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.560
under particle exchange now you might be thinking rich come on now you're just dramatizing your

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.800
own ignorance this isn't actually a mystery you just don't know the answer well it's true that I

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:45.440
don't know the answer but i'm not the only one who thinks that this is a mystery let me share with

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:50.960
you this quote from the spin statistics book this quote is in a passage about whether or not physics

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:55.520
can explain the spin statistics theorem or is just consistent with spin statistics

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:03.760
we should modify the meaning of understand and at the same time reduce our expectations of any

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:11.680
proof of the spin statistics theorem what is proved whether truly or not whether optimally or not

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:19.120
in an acceptable logical sequence or not is that the existing theory is consistent with the spin

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:25.760
statistics relation what is not demonstrated is a reason for the spin statistics relation

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:31.920
to belabor the point it is difficult to imagine a fundamental mechanism for the

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:38.640
poly exclusion principle upon which all depends which predicates it upon the analyticity properties

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:46.080
of vacuum expectation values of products of quantized field operators did god for lack of a

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:53.200
better word build a series of failed worlds which sputtered and died or exploded and disintegrated

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:58.720
before discovering the stabilizing effect of anti commutation relations for half integral spin fields

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.880
was this before or after imposing the requirements of Lorenz invariance

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.680
are we the lucky winners of a Monte Carlo simulation in which every choice was tried

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:14.320
and one survived must we reduce our demands on physics to require only consistency

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:19.920
does an understanding of the why of the spin statistics relation have no direct answer in

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:27.520
physics or must physics be formulated to include it the poly result does not explain the spin

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:32.320
statistics relation and cannot the noix wanders and the Feynman's of the world

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:37.360
must remain unsatisfied because the consistency of relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:42.400
field theory with the poly exclusion principle has every reason to be as complicated as these

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:48.320
subjects are not as simple and direct as the poly exclusion principle itself

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.440
so in short there there sure is a lot of mystery here and it's confusing but it's kind of cool

01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:01.040
to think about right but you know honestly i can only think about spinners for so long

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:06.640
before it starts to hurt it's like diving underwater you try to go as deep as you can but

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:11.520
at some point you have to come back up for air and it's all so disorienting that sometimes

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.520
when you stop thinking about spinners it's all so confusing and you feel like you're right back

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:22.240
to square one but my friends if there's one thing that spinners have taught us it's that just

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:27.040
because you returned to where you started doesn't mean you haven't picked something up along the way

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.040
so in that spirit i'd like to reiterate part of the quote from the beginning of the video

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:38.800
no one fully understands spinners their algebra is formally understood

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:45.280
but their general significance is mysterious i hope today i've given you some sense of the

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:48.720
algebra but most importantly an appreciation of the mystery

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:55.760
if you enjoyed watching this video as much as i enjoyed making it

01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:00.720
then please consider supporting my channel on patreon on there you'll be able to download

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:06.160
these beautiful magnificent pdfs with the equations and diagrams discussed in this video

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:11.680
and other videos too also if you sign up on patreon your input will help determine the

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.320
future direction of this channel i know what i'm going to do for the next few videos at least but

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.720
beyond that i don't know i need your advice what do you want to see where do you want to go you

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:24.800
want to go into electromagnetism as a gauge theory you want to go into superconductivity do you want

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:29.840
to go into whatever the case may be so anyway your support is not obligatory but it is greatly

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:36.640
and sincerely appreciated all right well hey thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next one
