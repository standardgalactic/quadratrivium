0	13320	On the program it says the ontology of social services but this grew and it's become very
13320	15560	complicated.
15560	23440	So I've been working on the ontology of services for many years and with the distinction between
23440	28440	goods and services and I don't think it's possible to provide a good definition of either
28440	32080	of these two terms which will please everybody.
32080	38960	We have to make sacrifices at the edges but I think that I've found a way of organising
38960	44240	a lot of the data that we have about goods and services in a way which is interesting
44240	51520	and potentially also useful and I want to use the word good to mean an independent continuance.
51520	56320	I'll talk a little bit about the issue that Matt raised earlier about goods which are
56320	61720	not independent continuance but for the moment I want to focus on this case and then I'm
61720	68120	going to talk about services and I'm going to suggest there are really two kinds of services.
68120	73600	On the one hand there are what we might call pure services which are just processes but
73600	80120	then on the other hand there are the great majority of services which create things and
80120	83280	it will become clear what they create as we go along.
83280	90480	Now the starting point is national income statistics or gross domestic product statistics
90480	97480	and the official tables for gross domestic product start with these items so personal
97480	104040	consumption expenditures are divided into expenditures on goods that means either durable
104040	109840	goods like refrigerators on young durable goods like hamburgers and then services so
109920	114800	they are pretty clear that there are two different kinds of entity at work here and they're
114800	121560	interested in these kinds of entities because money is involved and I am primarily interested
121560	128280	in these kinds of entities also because money is involved but I think that the distinction
128280	132960	holds even where no money is involved so this distinction can be applied for instance to
132960	138160	the charitable work of a convent for instance.
138160	142840	Alright so goods are material entities and they're created by manufacturers and farmers
142840	149240	and so forth and then there are some people think there are immaterial goods I don't have
149240	156040	a finished view on this but my current view says in the olden days software was a material
156040	162760	good it was made of silicon and rubber and whatever floppy disks were made of today you
162760	168280	don't buy software you rent it or you buy the rights to it you pay a fee so you can
168280	174240	have a right to use the software and the same I think applies to insurance you pay a fee
174240	179040	for the right to receive payments if you have a certain kind of loss so you pay a fee in
179040	184720	essence to gamble and so I don't think these are good counter examples to the idea that
184720	189920	goods are much material but as I say I have no finished view about this.
189920	196640	Now one, this is a little bit of philosophy here so I apologise, one distinction that
196640	202160	philosophers like to make is the distinction between intrinsic goods which I'm here calling
202160	208000	ultimate goods which are good in their own right and not for another reason that they
208000	214440	serve so these are all intrinsic goods you don't eat a hamburger because you want to
214440	219200	bring about another effect you eat a hamburger because the hamburger is a good in its own
219200	225640	right and similarly for all these other things so you don't read a novel because you want
225640	229440	to achieve something else you read the novel because reading the novel is good in its own
229440	238360	right well non-ultimate goods are goods that are involved in a chain of creation of ultimately
238360	243600	ultimate goods so the steering wheel is a good because it's going to become part of
243600	250480	a car which may be good in its own right and the design for a car is a good because it's
250480	255720	going to be used as a design for building a car which is a good in its own right so
255720	259720	there are goods which are goods for something and then there are goods which are goods in
259720	265960	their own right and there are many on either side and it's important to keep this distinction
265960	272120	in mind and if you want a little exercise you might think about whether there is a distinction
272120	279520	between ultimate services and services which are for something else goods have an economic
279520	285800	value but only if they enter into buying and selling processes and buying and selling unless
285800	294400	you do it yourself are services so when you buy a car this is a picture taken in the max
294400	302320	Heidegger RG which is the BMW sales center in Liechtenstein you deal with sales personnel
302320	308920	who offer services what do they bring about they bring about a new pattern of ownership
308920	313280	basically before the transaction you have the money and they have the car after the
313280	318360	transaction it's reversed all right so there are buying and selling services but there
318360	325680	are many other kinds of what we will call pecuniary services and the document acts come
325680	331800	into play in a big way so billing and securing payment and registering payment and ordering
331800	340080	and auditing and processing claims ranking hospital services ranking rankers of hospital
340080	345720	services and so on all of these things are examples of services which have to do with
345720	358040	the buying and selling the price determining side of things all right now goods are created
358040	366480	but then they're bought and sold they're transported it need be to the purchaser or maybe to the
366480	374040	finisher or maybe to the showroom where they can be shown to potential purchase and so on
374160	380480	and then that maybe they're protected they're kept in a climatized garage or something and
380480	384680	they're maintained and repaired and restored and so on over the years and then eventually
384680	390600	they are demolished or destroyed or recycled disposed of in some way so there is a product
390600	396360	life cycle the creation is the first step in the product life cycle maybe there's a zero
396680	405000	step which would be designed now all of these things are services so most of what goes on
405800	414040	in the life of a product a good is a service or involved services one way or another so these
414040	419320	are services which are applied directly to material entities so that's another kind of
419960	426920	ultimateness they are not applied to to people they're not applied to other services they're
426920	439320	applied to goods and demolition is a service I get a hundred dollars for every contract
439320	445240	that the bunker hill service is and then we have protecting services so you keep all your
445240	453080	cars in a warehouse which is protected by watchmen and electronic fences and cyber security
453080	460840	systems and so forth so certainly in the early stages of the supply chain for expensive goods
460840	465640	there is a lot of protection going on and then later on there'll be more and different sorts
465640	472280	of protection all right so goods are continuance so they exist beyond the time in which they are
472280	479720	created so there's a common view which I used to embrace according to which services all of
479720	486920	services are occurrence and I still embrace that view the common view will come in a minute
488280	495080	so that process is performed by a service provider or by a company of service providers
495960	501800	and now the view which I used to embrace for all services says that they're all what I would now
501800	509240	like to call pure services which means that production and consumption coincide at least
509240	517560	temporarily often spatio-temporally so a medical interpreter provides a service of interpreting
517560	524040	and in providing that service that service is also consumed by stuff there is no left over
524920	531160	and it's the same for a bodyguard a haunted house tour guide provides a service but you probably
531160	537960	forget what you learned so there's nothing left over that may be the memories which will fade
537960	544760	but no nothing which has economic significance for instance from any of these pure services I
544760	551400	think pure services are a relatively small fraction of the entire empire of services
552360	556200	so now let's move to social work and general medical practice
556200	564120	are these pure services so they can both of them have outcomes which means that they're
564120	569160	not pure services so in the one case the doctor may give you a bottle of pills
569960	575160	in the other case the social work again may give you a script which enables you to get money and so
576040	583880	both of them have alienable benefits and so they're not pure services so what about
584840	591160	just advice so you go to the doctor or to the social worker just to get advice then there are two
591160	598600	cases you ignore the advice or you accept the advice if you ignore the advice it's a it's a
598600	604840	pure service it's a very very weak and strange kind of nugatory pure service if the advice is
604840	610600	accepted however then there is something which survives and this is the central thesis of the
610680	620120	whole talk what survives is because you accept the advice to go running every day or stop beating
620120	627640	your wife or something the person who receives the advice acquires a new disposition and what
627640	633960	that means is that something in that person's brain has changed there's a new pattern in that
633960	639560	person's brain which serves as the basis for a disposition to go running every day or to stop
639560	648520	eating chocolate or something so pure services create no issue they're relatively rare and the
648520	653720	common view according to which services create nothing says that all services are pure services
653720	660200	and we reject that common view with the view that nearly all services create specifically dependent
660200	667400	continuance they create patterns quality patterns in for instance people's brains so these are the
667800	676360	examples of services and they're all impure services in my sense so the hairdresser creates a new
676360	682040	pattern on your head the gardener creates a new pattern in your garden and the teacher creates
682040	688280	a new pattern in your brain and none of those patterns are alienable you can't sell them or
688280	693800	store them or rent them but they're created by services and that's why we pay money for those
693800	701160	services because of what they create not because we enjoy watching the gardener or because we enjoy
701880	706120	hearing the hairdresser's clips but because we want the pattern
708360	714280	all right now this fits into bfo as follows the disposition has as its material basis
714280	720520	a new quality which is a pattern in the brain of the person who acquires the disposition
721480	727720	so we have material entities which are people families goods machines for creating goods
728280	735080	or transporting goods a pattern which is a kind of quality complex quality capability which i'll
735080	740760	talk about next which is the kind of disposition the client of the social worker has the capability
740760	746520	to go running every day and then the service itself which is a process and and now we can
747080	754760	capability a capability is a disposition of a certain sort whose realization someone
754760	761720	or some group could be an organism of a non-human kind but we'll focus on humans here
761720	769320	has an interest so you all have an interest in digesting your food and so you have a capability
769320	775720	of digesting your food your digestive system has the function of digesting food which is also a
775720	781320	capability but it's a special kind of capability if you have an interest in the realization of a
781320	787640	disposition that disposition is a capability we can now deal with hospital administration services
788920	795080	in the same sort of way so this is what we have the simple services which have outputs simple
795080	800760	patterns and the patterns are intrinsically valuable there that's the idea and these are all
800760	806120	experts who have certain capabilities so that they're able to perform services which bring about
806120	812120	these intrinsically valuable patterns but now there are more complex services such as hospital
812120	819080	consulting services and now we get a two-stage process the hospital consultant bears the capability
819080	825000	of the first type which is realized in the consulting service which has an output a pattern
825000	830680	in the hospital which is the material basis of a second capability which is the capability of the
830680	838920	hospital itself to smoothly more smoothly run than they did before the consultant performed her service
838920	846520	if you're lucky now we we are going to have ultimate services and the ultimate services are
847080	854760	just the first the simple case this case just the one pattern step and then non-ultimate services
854760	860280	will be the ones which have multiple steps in the case of the consultant we have a two-step
860280	867320	process we could have if you're teaching consultants to teach hospital managers how to run a hospital
867320	874520	that's a three-step process there and another hypothesis that we I think is correct here is
874520	881160	that many perhaps nearly all non-ultimate services are performed to create new capabilities either
881160	886840	new capabilities in things or in organizations or in people that's just a hypothesis but I
887560	892120	I have a suspicion that it's going to hold in many cases buying and selling I said yields new
892120	897000	patterns of ownership now you can understand the significance of that thesis so that we're dealing
897000	904760	with services in general as creating patterns and buying and selling our services and they
904760	911480	create patterns in a very obvious way all right now let's go back to the protect restore eliminate
911480	917640	kind of approach so we have this approach for goods so we protect our new car we restore our new car
917640	924520	by repainting it and we eliminate our car by disposing of it but you can do these things
924520	930920	also to patterns so we may want to we may want to restore the pattern that was established in
930920	937480	our garden by the famous landscape designer 100 years ago and so we want to restore the same
937480	944600	paint pattern not the garden as a good now but the pattern that was created by the landscape
944600	950600	designer and we may want to protect the knowledge that acquired or the capability of our dog to catch
950600	957880	beans all right but now we get another level of services because these processes are services
957960	964680	which are applied to patterns created by prior services when they successfully restored the
964680	972120	Darwin Martin house in Buffalo they went for the original seeds of the same seed stock
972760	979080	as we used by Frank Lloyd Wright to create the bushes in the gardens and so forth and a lot of
979080	986200	it had been sold when the house became decrepit during the period after the Second World War I
986200	993160	think by the wife of the then president of the university of Buffalo she sold some of the windows
993160	998360	which now cost if you can find one they cost $17,000 why do you want the original windows
998360	1002600	than the original bushes in order to create the original pattern as near as you can get
1002600	1008920	it's the same universal it's the same quality pattern as near as matters so if you want to get
1008920	1014440	the same capability to play tennis thing you have 10 years ago they can be applied to patterns
1014440	1021080	created by services but the same distinction can be applied to patterns in general so you may want
1021080	1029320	to protect an ancient forest which has never been touched by forest designers all right now we can
1029320	1035080	see how this works for different kinds of services so teaching and training the creating is the
1035080	1041960	coaching training in the gym and so on here the pattern protecting is things like follow-up exams
1041960	1049640	and promotion reviews pattern therapy is follow-up classes more more more exercise pattern restoring
1049640	1055240	is they send you back to school and pattern eliminating is brainwashing that's not a very
1055240	1063160	good example but Ryan came up with that example but I thought it was good at the time it's still
1063160	1073320	good for some purpose all right now gardening is obvious so you have anti-weed chemical spraying
1073320	1078360	tree doctor historical garden restoration and then eliminating the pattern would be weed removal
1080280	1087720	and dental that's obvious so creating the pattern is with the nears and caps that's creative dentistry
1087800	1093960	and then protective dentistry as a mouth guard prevented dentistry and training in brushing
1093960	1100040	and flossing restorative dentistry is restoring the correct pattern in your jaw through filling
1100040	1107640	and then eliminating limited dentistry is removing the tube and medical in general well we have
1107640	1114520	creative medicine which is cosmetic medicine and then protective medicine which is diet and exercise
1114520	1121320	therapy for instance therapy itself repairing in other words the curing the infection resetting
1121320	1128680	the broken arm or removing the tumor so these are all types of medical services which involve
1129720	1134600	something created like that your whole body was created in the first place by your parents
1136200	1141080	and then protecting what's created repairing what's created restoring what's created or
1141160	1149400	eliminating what's created or bits of it and so this is a picture of the high healthcare supply
1149400	1157880	chain so you want to protect the services of the hospital and that means you want to keep track of
1157880	1164120	how all the bed linen and all the pharmaceutical supplies and all the patients and all the ambulances
1164120	1169640	and all the fuel and so on are being delivered to the appropriate place in the supply chain at
1169640	1173720	the appropriate time in order to keep the hospital and the ambulance service running
1175160	1182040	not to mention the 911 service and so forth and now this is the final slide
1183960	1191160	just to get back to social services so creative social work is where the social
1191160	1197720	worker provides advice which in the successful case issued the nudist disposition on the side
1197720	1203320	of the client protected social work is where the social worker reports the case to the child
1203320	1212440	protective services that may be another partner for CBP and then prevented social work is
1213320	1219480	counseling the client on incipient family related problems with the aim of preventing them from
1219480	1227000	occurring restorative social work is social work with the goal of restoring those patterns
1227000	1231640	which is characteristic of healthy family development and then I couldn't think of an
1231640	1238600	example of eliminative social work so my name is Bart Gajdović I'm a postdoc at the University of
1238600	1247880	Toronto at the Center for Social Service Engineering and we work on essentially data
1247880	1256120	standards and ontologies for interoperability between social services and we focus on things
1256120	1263880	like measuring impact of services and service provisioning on clients and so this is really
1263880	1269160	interesting work that well that I've heard today but also that Barry has been working on and we
1269160	1276040	kind of started this discussion at the the joel workshops we had a workshop there on social
1276040	1283000	services and so yeah so this is this is really sort of interesting work in sort of defining
1283080	1287000	services for maybe a different perspective or a different use case but I really like the
1287000	1293640	the direction that this is going Barry so thanks very much and you don't have a question or a
1293640	1301800	criticism I have three questions actually if there's time one is I'm trying to understand
1301800	1306040	what a pattern is it is is it just a state that has some kind of structure
1306520	1316040	so it's basically the idea of quality in BFO arises as follows there are two kinds of attributes
1316040	1321400	that things can have one kind of attribute is what we call realizable which means that
1321400	1327480	it's not really there as something which is manifest but it can be made manifest by some
1327720	1337400	made manifest by some kind of external signal or process or some other means so and realisables
1337400	1342760	we decide divide into two parts dispositions which I've talked about just now and then roles
1342760	1350360	which Matias talked about yes Matias talked about earlier on the other hand are those attributes
1350360	1357080	which are manifest all the time to the extent that the bearer of the attribute has that attribute
1357080	1363080	and they they're called qualities and now patterns are just complex qualities that's all we mean
1363960	1368920	so the kind of pattern that I'm thinking of primarily in many of these examples is a pattern
1368920	1375000	in your brain so that would be a very very complicated electromagnetic electrochemical
1375000	1383160	magnetic pattern and whether that well we don't use the word state as a technical term in BFO
1383720	1390440	because we don't know what would be a good definition of state but I think the example
1390440	1399560	will give you a clue as to what we mean by a quality pattern okay great my second question was
1399560	1405160	so this is sort of there was leftover from the the previous workshop on social services but
1406120	1412840	you mentioned that a service is only something that is either I think I think you said a
1412840	1419320	legislative or has some kind of monetary exchange and so no no I I don't I don't think I ever held
1419320	1427080	that what I and what I said today was that I'm using examples of services which do have some
1427080	1433320	kind of commercial or pecuniary significance but I don't believe that the account I'm giving is
1434280	1440920	exclusively going to hold for those kinds of cases so I have a I think a general view of service
1440920	1449240	which is as general as your view of service okay so something like a community providing services
1449240	1454520	to or some people in a community providing like let's say meal services to yeah yeah that would
1454520	1462120	be a service in my opinion okay and the final question is this example of eliminative I was
1462120	1466760	trying to think I was trying to think if something like removing someone's addiction would be
1466760	1472200	eliminative but rereading your definitions here sounds like that would be more restorative
1473400	1478040	yeah so I said that it was that the eliminative one was sometimes hard to find examples and I
1478040	1484360	can't find even one but there is someone in the room who I think has an example I wanted to offer
1484360	1490680	a limited to could be interpreted as a non-ultimate service through the cessation of the social
1490680	1497880	service itself but that wouldn't eliminate the problem on the part of the client that and all
1497880	1502840	of the other cases have to do with the problem on the part of the client and and you're not going to
1502840	1516680	say kill the client no would it be maybe eliminating obstacles in the clients I mean if patterns are
1516680	1522520	just in the client's mind would it be eliminating sort of cognitive I think that's preventive
1523960	1530920	sounds more like preventive you're eliminating temptations for instance but as I say I don't
1530920	1538600	think that there is that I don't think it's a sound category eliminative social service
1540760	1546520	it just doesn't feel right I don't think it breaks everything but it does mean that there is a week
