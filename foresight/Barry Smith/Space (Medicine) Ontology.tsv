0	7280	Good afternoon everybody. Bienvenue Ã  tous. My name is David Eidelman. I'm Vice Principal
7280	11840	Health Affairs and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and it's my pleasure
11840	16720	to welcome you all to a session on Healthcare in Deep Space, Autonomous Medicine Practical
16720	22480	AI in Advanced Simulation. This is the session's part of McGill Space Week as you know and it's
22480	28800	a signature event of McGill's bicentennial celebrations. You know, we just heard about AI,
28800	34320	we heard about the application of existing technologies and we heard about complexity
35120	41520	and space missions obviously are the prototype of highly complex systems operating in an
41520	47520	environment in which you have to handle lots of heterogeneous data and information sets and in
47520	53920	order to be successful in spaceflight you have to figure out how to do this and to do that you need
53920	58400	to really know what you're talking about and there you know Professor Smith's going to describe
58400	64720	the foundational principles necessary to integrate all aspects of complex systems including emission
64720	71360	systems using biologic and other data and into an information architecture that really supports the
71360	79280	use of advanced modular algorithms and so Professor Smith the floor is yours. I'm going to transfer
79280	87520	over take it away. Good so I'm not going to be able to do all of that but I will try and do at least
87520	95760	some samples which will give you an idea of how it could be done and I'll start with some background so
95760	102640	I started life as a philosopher working on metaphysics. Recently I started a whole new
103840	111120	line of thinking. I'm about to publish a book with a German AI entrepreneur colleague of mine on
111760	118480	artificial intelligence which more or less agrees with everything that Gary Marcus says
118480	126000	in his book but takes it further so we try and document in great detail the limits of AI when
126000	133040	dealing specifically with complex systems such as organisms and missions to Mars and so forth
133600	139520	and if we've got time I may come back to show the relevance of that to the main topic here
140240	149440	so which goes back to 2002 when I was awarded a prize to establish an institute in Germany to
149440	157680	deal with the ontology of medicine and this prize was awarded because people working in
158880	165440	computational ontology already then had started to use some of my ideas from philosophical ontology
166080	171600	so I started the institute and the first thing I realized was that I was probably going to be
171600	178400	spending the rest of my life studying one single ontology which was the gene ontology which John
178400	186800	mentioned already. Gene ontology solved a very considerable problem namely the problem of making
186800	195280	human genome and mouse genome and fly genome data useful for medicine and the idea was that the
195280	203440	gene ontology provided a systematic semantically well-grounded common consensus terminology across
203440	212240	all organisms and all disciplines which could be used to tag sequences whether they're gene sequences
212240	221360	or protein sequences or any other kind of sequence and this was a great success it was
221360	228480	brought to my attention very early on in working in this new institute and the first thing I realized
228480	236720	about it was that it was full of mistakes and mistakes of a logical nature which a philosopher
236800	245520	learns about in the first logic class at the beginning of their studies and so I had money for
245520	251600	the new institute I invited the leadership of the gene ontology to come to the institute in Leipzig
253120	260240	and I went through pointing out all the mistakes that they were making so this is just one example
260240	267920	a lytic vacuole within a protein storage vacuole is classified by the gene ontology as a protein
267920	274720	storage vacuole it was then this is a bit like saying that an embryo within a uterus is a uterus
274720	281600	it's an ontological mistake of a very simple logical sort and in those days the gene ontology
281600	290000	was full of such mistakes it was also doing the job of providing semantic definitions useful to humans
290640	296080	in a in a way which involved similar kinds of mistakes so this is a circular definition
296720	301360	it's not a good definition doesn't it doesn't and it cannot tell you anything about the meaning
301360	308480	of hemolysis because the word is used in the definition so I presented a talk at the meeting
309120	316160	in Leipzig entitled stop or smart terminology through ontological principles
316160	324960	and the the head of the gene ontology initiative Michael Ashburner at the end of who was in the room
325920	331680	on the front row smiling throughout he took me behind the curtain and he made a deal with me
331680	338880	he said Barry I will put you in charge of the logic of the gene ontology and in return you
339120	347040	promise never to criticize the gene ontology in public and I I sold my soul I said yes
348240	355680	I'm not criticizing the gene ontology today the gene ontology has improved in part I think because
355680	363680	of some of the things I did but more importantly I helped the gene ontology to marshal or heard the
363680	370160	many cats that is to say the many other ontologies which were being built in biomedicine in its
370160	377200	wake ontologies in areas like proteomics or anatomy or disease and some of the ontologies
377200	383920	mentioned by John earlier today were built precisely in this effervescence of ontology
383920	390960	creativity in medicine or in let's say biology to be careful which arose as a result of the
390960	398640	success of the gene ontology so the oboe foundry is a collection of ontologies which are built to
398640	406000	be interoperable from the very start so this is anticipating silos and deliberately taking
406000	413440	steps establishing principles to avoid the the appearance of those silos by ensuring that
413440	420240	everybody involved in the ontology building effort is aware of what everyone else who is involved
420240	427600	in the ontology building effort at the points where the ontology is overlap so that the overlap
427600	433360	is always such that the ontologies which do overlap are consistent in those areas
434240	440560	so this is a picture of the of the oboe foundry as it then was basic formal ontology is
441360	448080	the very top level of the gene ontology it's a reverse engineered generalization of the
448080	455040	gene ontology which covers everything in the universe but only at a very general metaphysical
455040	462160	level and we'll see a bit more about what that means later on so basic formal ontology is the key
462880	469760	to the unifiability of all the ontologies which are built in a way that descends from basic
469760	475920	formal ontology it provides the starting point for defining the terms in non-circular ways
476480	484800	in principle in every other ontology we've got now to 2005 now this this is a hub and
484800	491040	spokes model of ontology development you start with the top level and then you move to a slightly
491040	495760	the most specific level and then you move from there to a slightly more specific level all the
495760	503280	while maintaining maximal consistency in areas where ontology is overlap and this works it worked
503280	512560	really well and the army heard about it and in 2008 I was presenting a talk which was designed to
512560	519520	help the army solve problems that they had with silos in their data from Afghanistan at the time
519520	526960	and it was the army eventually which sponsored the proposal to make BFO an international standard
526960	534960	ISO IEC 21838-2 I'll come back to that well it's here actually there are two parts the first part
535680	540880	standardize is what it means to be a top level ontology so an ontology that can serve as a
540880	548400	universal general hub for the spokes which are created by domain ontologies and then part two
548400	556320	shows that BFO is satisfying the requirements for being a top level ontology set forth in part one
556320	561440	and these standards are both in the public domain you don't have to pay for them and BFO of course
561440	568160	is also in the public domain it's used now by some 500 different initiatives and the number
568160	575520	grows all the time so in 2010 my colleagues in Buffalo received a very large IR per grant to
575520	581040	create a set of ontologies to deal with everything in the universe these are called the common core
581040	587760	ontologies they they were built to satisfy some needs of the intelligence community which are
587760	593520	not important here but what is important is that some of the ontologies within that ecosystem
594240	603120	were created for space and this is just a few examples so this is the common core ontologies
603120	610160	ecosystem the space ontologies are down here so we have space event ontology space object
610160	615760	ontology is space mission ontology and stuff and we deal with things like residence space
615760	622560	objects such as satellites missions functions components and so forth these are the space
622560	630240	objects and then we have object aggregates we have orbits so this is the ontology of different
630240	638320	kinds of orbits you thought the idea of orbit was simple and it is not simple and then we have
638320	648320	missions and maneuvers we have sensors and now we get back to medicine so John made a number of
648320	656960	points concerning what we would need to address if we wanted to have useful medicine ontology
657840	664080	and it's rather easy it's probably too easy to build ontologies the problem is to build useful
664080	671280	ontologies and useful ontologies should be interoperable with existing useful ontologies
671280	677440	and so there is a certain homesteading effect in the world of ontology if you have ontologies which
677440	682480	are already serving a purpose and doing it very well then you should if you want to build an
682480	689200	ontology in a related domain you should ensure that you build your ontology by using what exists
689200	696400	already as your starting point this very often doesn't happen because you get paid for doing
696400	703600	something new and for reusing what already exists it's hard to get paid and so there is a certain
704480	711120	tendency to promote silo formation of the sort which John described so how do we build a useful
711120	716720	space medicine ontology that was in fact part of what we were trying to do from the very beginning
716720	722400	in the medical information science although of course we had no idea that this would become
722400	729200	particularly relevant in the in the space context so what we want to do is to document
729200	736800	medical knowledge especially as it's relevant to space travel and then we want to find an optimal
736800	743360	way in which relevant knowledge can be retrieved on a mission and the idea would be that you have
743360	748240	all the medical knowledge that there is and you have some way of finding the medical knowledge
748240	755040	that you need that can then find that knowledge very quickly and very successfully and the problem is
755040	761280	that all the medical knowledge that you have is full of garbage and this is one of the reasons why
761280	768560	foundation models as described by Gary are so unhelpful when it comes to mission critical
768560	775760	applications so why is the and totality of medical knowledge that we have full of garbage well first
775760	783920	of all doctors make mistakes and medical science advances doctors don't always keep pace with medical
783920	789280	advances some of them do some of them don't and so doctors have conflicts they have inconsistent
789280	796400	diagnoses sometimes for the same patient and all of this gets added to the totality of medical
796400	803760	knowledge all of the EMRs which exist and all of the problem lists which exist grow and get bigger
803760	809440	and bigger and get added to the totality of medical knowledge all records are still records
810000	817760	when doctors make diagnoses clinical coders have to document those diagnoses using clinical codes
818320	823920	and those clinical coders make errors in coding and they have certain tendencies and habits to code
823920	829840	in certain ways and different coders have different habits and then worst of all and that's what I'm
829840	835600	going to talk about next is that the coding systems change and this is good because medical science
835600	841520	advances but the coding systems should change gracefully and they should change in such a way
841520	849040	that changes then can be fed back to filter out the consequences of the older systems which have
849040	856640	been shown to be no longer scientifically coherent and even worse than coding systems themselves
856640	864080	ferment errors because some of the coding systems are to be honest badly built and and then coding
864080	869920	systems generate forking this is a problem that we will see in a minute all right now I could say
870800	877120	bad things about most medical coding systems I'm afraid I had a a long career in which I was
877120	883040	comparable to the little boy who says that the emperor does not have any clothes where the emperor
883040	890960	were was world leading medical coding systems communities it was an exciting time this is
890960	898560	a quote from Gary so foundation models he says are more like parlor tricks than genuine intelligence
898560	905120	unfortunately the the problems in medicine don't even yield the parlor tricks they're not interesting
905120	912160	errors they're just errors of a very messy sort now let's look at snow med ct which John already
912160	918160	mentioned and he mentioned Roger Cotay I will mention a story about Roger Cotay which I'm not
918160	924480	sure is true but certainly there's some truth to it Cotay visited the Vatican he wanted to present
924480	932080	the six volumes of snow med ct to the pope and so he was chatting with the pope and the pope was
932080	938960	looking at six volumes and then the pope raised his head and he said are you aware that this spells
938960	945600	demons backwards now whether that is a true story or not uh no one will ever know so this is a little
945600	953280	piece of snow med showing how it changed from 2016 to 2017 it's a very very trivial example but it
953280	961440	will show you how you get bloat so this is the opposite of silos bloat is when you get inconsistent
961440	970560	data because there isn't a silo in 2016 a test kit is classified as a substance which may or may
970560	978880	not be good in 2017 is classified as a physical object which also may or may not be good but the
978880	986320	fact that you have both of those classifications in your system is going to mean that data about
986320	993040	test kit which was entered into the record in 2016 will conflict with data about test kits
993040	1003520	entered in 2017 and that's not good if it happens all the time now here we have 2015 2016 we see
1003520	1012960	that there is on the left a joint finding and disorder of musculoskeletal system these are both
1012960	1020720	parents of orthopathy which is a disorder now a disorder is something on the side of the patient
1020720	1026640	it's a broken leg or it's a disease a finding is something on the side of a physician it's what the
1026640	1033280	physician finds or discovers in the world one of the same thing should not be both on the side of
1033280	1041360	the patient and on the side of the clinician it's a very basic error snow med is full of that error
1041360	1047280	there are so many different ways in which that error is made in snow med that snow med generates
1047280	1056960	bloat and now this is just one term in snow med and two versions 2002 and 2010 so the term is
1056960	1062480	excision biopsy of vulval lesion this term is chosen at random you would get similar bloats
1062480	1074720	from the many terms so every single track through this monster can be found if you join snow med 2002
1074720	1081440	with so 2010 and the clinical coders are coding at different levels within this monster they're
1081440	1089200	putting down data about one and the same medical phenomenon namely the process of biopsy from a
1089200	1094560	vulval lesion and they're each coding that with a different code for how it looks is this so this
1094560	1100320	is just this is from that diagram i've just zoomed a little bit procedure characterized by action
1100320	1105760	status is a navigational concept in snow med that means it tells you how you got that concept or
1105760	1112160	something and then you have procedure carried out on subject which is what snow med calls a
1112160	1118480	situation we're also told that it's a procedure carried out which is another situation but at
1118480	1125680	the same time it's a procedure on a body system which is a procedure so we have four ontologically
1125680	1132080	different things namely navigational concept situations and procedures applied to one and the
1132080	1138880	same medical phenomenon and the reason is that snow med's top level is incoherent now it's
1138880	1144640	incoherent has been recognized for some years by what we might call the intellectual leaders of
1144640	1152720	the snow med community and each year they propose to the general snow med management assembly that
1152720	1160960	they should drop the snow med top level and re-architect snow med using bfo there is now reason
1160960	1169120	to be optimistic that they will finally achieve a majority vote bfo does not allow that kind of
1169120	1175440	forking it doesn't allow four different terms at the very high ontological level to be applied to
1175440	1183120	one and the same item it's built on good ontological principles and it's much simpler to use than the
1183120	1188720	snow med top level and it makes clear distinctions between things like entities on the side of the
1188720	1197520	patient and entities on the side of the clinician so how do we get a useful space medicine ontology
1197520	1204640	well nasa has a chief information officer and they have a an information system which is an
1204640	1211040	information system covering all of the astronauts who ever existed in in the west and all the families
1211040	1217920	of all the astronauts it's very high level it uses unfortunately multiple coding systems but all of
1217920	1224560	the coding systems could in principle be unified and focused on a revised version of snow med which
1224560	1231280	is what the nasa cio should be calling for a revised version with a proper top level it should
1231280	1236960	eliminate the errors basically where they are easily identifiable and it's here i think that ai
1236960	1243440	could play a role because we already have a large amount of data which is relevant to space missions
1243440	1250400	because the astronauts are involved it's maintained and curated by top level clinicians and it's
1250480	1258800	accessible already it just needs to be filtered to remove inconsistencies and well i just conclude so
1259440	1264800	would therefore be useful for space medicine as john explained it would be useful for everyone else
1264800	1270800	because it would serve as a kind of ground truth the equivalent of a foundation model but one which
1270800	1277920	would have been well built and i won't try and talk about deep mind i will i will stop
1279600	1285040	and i hope you're all still there
