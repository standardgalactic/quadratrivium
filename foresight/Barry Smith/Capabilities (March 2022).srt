1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,440
We've been working on capabilities now for about three years, and we've gone to and

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,640
fro on how we want to understand capabilities.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:22,000
I now believe that we have a stable view, which works for all the counter examples that

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,080
people had been bringing forward, provided we accept certain caveats about how we're

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,920
understanding capability.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,720
And the idea is that there are many words like capacity, ability, power, which have

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,280
similar meanings to the word capability.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,000
We just want to standardize on one meaning of the word capability, which will be compatible

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,680
with BFO, whether we introduce the word capability into BFO is still an open question.

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,560
So this is BFO, and we're interested, and BFO is now an international standard.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,320
It's been approved, and you can find the relevant files here.

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:10,760
So you can now see the entire ISO file content if you go to the right place, which is unusual.

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,680
Usually you have to pay 195 Swiss francs to get the PDF version of the ISO standard.

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:26,400
So we're interested particularly in material entities, such as people and laptops on the

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:34,840
one hand, and in dispositions and roles, primarily in dispositions.

16
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,320
Capabilities are going to turn out to be a subkind of disposition.

17
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,960
But we're interested in roles because we have to distinguish those kinds of capability-like

18
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,080
entities, which are in fact roles rather than dispositions.

19
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:59,040
Those roles and dispositions are realisables in BFO terms, and I think we all know what

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,000
realisable means, so an attribute of a material entity is a realisable if there is a certain

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,560
kind of process which manifests it, makes it manifest, makes it appear.

22
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:19,520
So going bald is a disposition which all males possess, and this disposition is realized

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,440
in processes of losing hair.

24
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:31,560
And so now dispositions are well-known, cases of realisables, roles are well-known, cases

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,720
of realisables, functions are a special kind of disposition, and we're going to introduce

26
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,720
now capabilities.

27
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,080
Dispositions in general include bad things like losing hair.

28
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,360
These are good things like thinking or speaking.

29
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,880
Functions are really good things, as we shall see.

30
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:03,840
And then roles are those things, those attributes which we have in virtue of some social convention

31
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,160
or social description.

32
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:13,840
So being king or being the owner or being a renter are all matters which hold independently

33
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,840
of any kind of physical changes, where functions, capabilities and dispositions, all of which

34
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,960
are dispositions, have to occur, physical changes have to occur before they exist.

35
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:36,160
All right, so this is where function goes in BFO, and a function is a disposition which

36
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,080
is the raison d'être of its bearer.

37
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,960
Functions don't like it when I say raison d'être, because they think that that sounds

38
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:53,360
like teleology, but functions are teleological entities which exist in the world.

39
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:02,800
And they exist because there has to be entities of that sort, for reasons of survival and

40
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,400
reproduction in the case of biological functions and for reasons of need or desire in the case

41
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,120
of artifactual functions.

42
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:23,040
So the BFO idea is that only material entities have functions, and they have that function

43
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,040
for as long as the disposition remains a real physical possibility.

44
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:35,080
So if I have a heat pump in my attic, and my attic becomes so full that I can't enter

45
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,880
the attic to switch on the heat pump, and maybe things solidify, so it's impossible

46
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,840
for any person to go into the attic.

47
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,200
The function of the heat pump is still the same, it's to pump heat.

48
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:55,280
So functions in particular and dispositions in general are merely a matter of the intrinsic

49
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,520
physical possibilities of the bearer.

50
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,560
The environment doesn't matter, where for the roles, the environment and particularly

51
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,160
the social environment is the only thing which matters.

52
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:14,320
So a very sick heart still has the function to pump block, even if it can only just pump.

53
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,480
Maybe even if it can't pump at all because it's been removed temporarily from its hosts,

54
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,760
it still has the function to pump block.

55
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:30,200
So you're saying this is only a material entity?

56
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,720
Only material entities have functions.

57
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,840
This is just a terminological declaration.

58
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,920
This is Humpty Dumpty, words mean just what I want them to mean.

59
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,360
So you can't argue with it, it's just a...

60
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Excellent.

61
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,520
So what is the function of that?

62
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:55,360
So it doesn't have a function in the BFO sense.

63
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,320
We can come back to that later.

64
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,800
All right, so this definition of function is perfectly standard.

65
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,960
So this is the Millican selective effect theory, which is also the genontology theory of function.

66
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,800
But BFO extends it to include artifacts.

67
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,440
So not only organic entities such as your heart have a function, but also your pen,

68
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,000
your laptop, the overhead projector and so forth.

69
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,680
They all have functions and there are two kinds of function, biological and artifactual.

70
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,160
Now capabilities.

71
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,800
Once we dealt with functions, we realized that there are other realisables left over.

72
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:50,040
So a lathe operator is trained to operate a lathe, but it's not the function of the

73
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,760
lathe operator to operate a lathe.

74
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,440
It's not clear that a lathe operator has any function, but he certainly has a capability

75
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,040
to operate a lathe because he's been trained.

76
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,280
So this is the first place where capability comes into this picture.

77
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:15,680
The chairman of the board has the authority to hire people or fire people or change the

78
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,840
regulations of the company.

79
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,960
That is a role.

80
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:26,460
Now given that he has that role, he can do things.

81
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,040
But that's not capability in the sense here, because it's not physical, it's not a matter

82
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,360
of physics, it's a matter of social norms.

83
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,920
And so we're going to ignore roles henceforth.

84
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,040
We're only interested in capabilities.

85
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
All right.

86
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,800
Now these are the kinds of entities which can have functions.

87
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,040
I don't think organisms have functions, but I'm willing to accept that the functions

88
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:59,880
of organisms might be to survive and to reproduce, so purely basic biological functions.

89
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,960
But generally speaking, parts of organisms have functions.

90
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,800
All your organs have functions, all your organ systems have functions, all your nephrons

91
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,440
have functions.

92
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,800
So the organism is full of functional parts.

93
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,740
And then all machines, all designed artifacts have functions because that's the definition

94
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,760
of the word artifact.

95
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:29,160
They are entities which were designed to perform a certain process.

96
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,840
And that means that they were designed to have a function, which is realized in that

97
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,600
process.

98
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:46,520
And then I think organizations have functions to help the poor to promote the pursuit of

99
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,720
good ontology.

100
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,320
These are functions of organization.

101
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,240
Now the queen bee or worker bees may have functions.

102
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,280
So it may be that for colonial organisms there are more specific functions than just surviving

103
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,840
and reproducing.

104
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,000
Now we're still on the level of intuitions.

105
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,160
We don't have a definition of capability yet.

106
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,840
But it's clear that my car has many more functions, sorry, many more capabilities than it has

107
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:22,320
functions, probably infinitely many more.

108
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,400
And I've just listed a few here.

109
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,240
And nowadays car manufacturers build many, many capabilities into their cars.

110
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,600
So to allow you to experience G-forces for instance seems to be a new, in Houston anyway

111
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:48,720
seems to be a new thing that cars have the capability to do and to impress your neighbors.

112
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,760
So there are many more kinds of entities which can have capabilities.

113
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,120
So these are all entities which can have functions.

114
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
They can also have capabilities.

115
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:08,520
But then these are entities which can have capabilities, which can't have function.

116
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:17,760
Because organisms can do things like dancing, the Foxtrot, ruling China.

117
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,960
And groups of organisms can do things like that too.

118
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:28,120
And also undesigned parts of nature can do things, like caves and so forth, which are

119
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,120
good for us, which we would like to happen.

120
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,000
So the world of capabilities is wider than the world of functions, all right.

121
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,360
Now this is work which is going to happen within BFO and so we have certain formal constraints.

122
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,160
The first formal constraint is every function is a capability and this is trivial.

123
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:58,600
If you're designed to perform a certain job then you're designed to execute your function

124
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,320
but that means you have the capability of executing your function.

125
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,320
So every function is a capability.

126
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:12,760
And the second formal constraint is that every capability is a disposition.

127
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,560
And this is, again, just for the sake of having a place for capability within the collection

128
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,640
of BFO-conformant ontologies.

129
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,400
And so it looks like this.

130
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,920
We have dispositions, a proper subset of dispositions are capabilities, a proper subset of capabilities

131
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
of functions.

132
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,120
And these things sometimes have role-like counterparts, but we won't deal with those.

133
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,560
This is the definition.

134
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,920
This has taken a long time and it really does work and it copes with apparent counter-examples

135
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,600
to some of the things we want to say about capabilities, which were problems for earlier

136
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,040
definitions that we were experimenting with.

137
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,240
So this is it.

138
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:04,040
Disposition in whose realization some organism or group of organisms has an interest.

139
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:10,360
And it's important that an entity which has been lying underground for hundreds of years

140
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:17,040
and which has the capability of threshing a certain kind of wheat which no longer grows

141
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:24,320
anywhere on earth, still, because it's been physically unchanged, has the capability of

142
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,240
threshing that kind of wheat.

143
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,000
Even though no one will ever want to exercise that capability.

144
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,280
And that's purely in order to save the axiom that every capability is a disposition.

145
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
All right.

146
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,560
So now we have some axioms which hold of capabilities.

147
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:53,160
So if a part of an organism has a function, then that organism itself has an interest

148
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,200
in the realization of that function.

149
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,040
And so that organism has that capability.

150
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:06,840
So we can apply the interest definition of capability to organic entities like hearts

151
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,560
and nephrons and digestive systems and so forth.

152
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,160
All of those are capabilities.

153
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:21,120
This is trivial because they're already functions, but still it's an important way to illustrate

154
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,640
the role of interest.

155
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:35,600
Now that biological axiom implies that we have many interests of which we know nothing.

156
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:43,160
And for many millions of years, organisms had many, many interests of which they knew

157
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,320
nothing of any of those interests.

158
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,640
Now because organisms, because interests can exist even though we don't know about them,

159
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,240
this follows that capabilities can be discovered.

160
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:08,880
So there are many unknown capabilities in the world and some of them can be discovered.

161
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,040
Whenever we make a plan, we have an interest in the realization of all the processes prescribed

162
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,160
by that plan.

163
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:25,600
And so if those are processes which are real possibilities, then they are capabilities.

164
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:35,280
And facilitation in the prescription axiom, actually no, then there is a facilitation

165
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
axiom.

166
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:43,440
If someone has an interest in realizing a disposition D and if the realization of some

167
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:50,380
other disposition D prime facilitates the realization of D, then that someone has an

168
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,520
interest in the realization of D prime.

169
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:04,440
And so facilitates here means either that D prime's realization is necessary for D to

170
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:13,640
exist or that D prime's realization occurring would improve the grade of the realization

171
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,640
of D.

172
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:21,640
And mentioning grade here introduces the topic of gradeability, yes, Jupps?

173
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:28,640
So if the facilitation also includes, the form of grade would improve the grade of the

174
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,640
latter, then why can your axiom be like this?

175
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,640
If you could only include the master card, it would be necessity.

176
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,640
Then it would be with the axiom, which would go to the axiom again.

177
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,640
But there may also be, X may have an interest in realizing the prescription D, but maybe

178
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,640
not in D because facilitation is not a necessity.

179
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:55,640
So he might say, D can be realized slower, if D prime facilitates and then I have D

180
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
faster, I maybe don't want this.

181
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,640
So he will not want D prime, but still want D because he's interested in the slow realization

182
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,640
of D. I could like, like getting, like eating a meal slowly, but eating it quickly.

183
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
Yes.

184
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
And so on and so forth.

185
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
So can you...

186
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,640
If the facilitation is necessary for the realization of D, then I suppose...

187
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,640
So that isn't a worry that has gone through my mind, but you've just given me a good example.

188
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Can you write it down?

189
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,640
And we'll talk about it later.

190
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:30,640
So I need to think this through.

191
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
All right.

192
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,640
So gradeability has been in the theory of capabilities from the beginning.

193
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,640
So it's an important feature of functions that they're gradeable.

194
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,640
And it's important feature of capabilities that they're gradeable.

195
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,640
So your heart has the function to pump blood.

196
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:53,640
And when it's functioning in a prototypical way, then it's doing its job.

197
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:00,640
And it can deviate from doing that job more and more, but then the heart is no longer functioning

198
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,640
and you're dead.

199
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:09,640
So that's when the function and the capability go out of existence.

200
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:17,640
And this is the extreme form of gradeability, zero score on the gradeability change.

201
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,640
But all capabilities have gradeability in that sense.

202
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,640
And that goes hand in hand with the fact that capabilities are what we learn in school.

203
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:34,640
So we were learning earlier today about how education is to either create capabilities

204
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,640
or increase the grade of capabilities.

205
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Capabilities like functions are permanent, so they last for so long as the disposition,

206
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,640
which they are the disposition, exists as a real physical possibility.

207
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:56,640
So this is a summary which just lists the definitions in the order which I gave them.

208
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,640
And now this is a restatement of how the diagram works.

209
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,640
So dispositions sometimes are such that we have an interest in their realization

210
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
and then they become capabilities.

211
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,640
And capabilities, some of them, are in fact the reason for the existence of the bearer,

212
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
and that's when we have functions.

213
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,640
Can you go back to the previous slide?

214
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,640
There's a permanent capabilities of permanent.

215
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Permanent until the real physical possibility ceases to exist.

216
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,640
So you break the thing, or you...

217
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,640
So you take the language...

218
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Which I'm coming to.

219
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,640
You forget the language.

220
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Then the capability ceases to exist.

221
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,640
So permanent as long as the real physical possibility exists.

222
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,640
So long as you have the real physical possibility of speaking English, you have the capability.

223
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,640
If you forget it, and then we have to teach it to you all over again,

224
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,640
that's a new capability.

225
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
Bill?

226
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,640
Oh, I guess I was thinking about things like offering...

227
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:27,640
Yes, so if you find that Remdesivir has the capability of curing COVID,

228
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,640
let's suppose you find that, then it's still not the function of Remdesivir to cure COVID.

229
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:40,640
But if you then make new Remdesivir pills, are they pills?

230
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
Yes.

231
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:49,640
And put COVID pill on the box, then the function of those new pills is to cure COVID.

232
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Remdesivir is talking about things like aspirin that get prescribed for pain relief,

233
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,640
and also it has a blood thinner.

234
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,640
So first of all, many things have multiple functions, particularly organic things.

235
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:13,640
I understand it seems like there was a social shift there, not necessarily...

236
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,640
So it's all...

237
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,640
Yeah, it's all a question of raison d'etre.

238
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,640
But look, there's also all selected in the definition.

239
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,640
So I mean, most of the...

240
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,640
Since Earth exists, most of the time there have not been humans around,

241
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,640
good design and things, but then all the functions were selected by nature.

242
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,640
So that's what this is supposed to mean, right?

243
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Yeah.

244
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:46,640
Yeah, I think that drug ontology slide with what's the generic for well-vutron and anti-depressant,

245
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,640
that subsequently got repurposed for smoking cessation.

246
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
Right.

247
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,640
That bucropin or something like that.

248
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,640
And when it's branded as well-vutron, its function is anti-depressant.

249
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:06,640
When it's branded as the other drug, brand name, its function is to not smoke,

250
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
they both have both capabilities.

251
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
Yeah.

252
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,640
So I think that it works for rebranding like that.

253
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
It's not...

254
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
It's in more labor.

255
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
You can have multiple functions in one...

256
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
Right.

257
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Yeah.

258
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
Like well-vutron does not have the anti-smoking...

259
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,640
No, but SSRI is a multiple function in more labor.

260
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
No, it's not.

261
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
It's got all those functions.

262
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
It's alright.

263
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
It's alright.

264
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,640
But if a new function is assigned to it, because you give it to drivers,

265
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,640
then it's added and then you have a new function until the second period.

266
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,640
So I guess I think about this a little bit from a data annotator standpoint.

267
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
And I'm trying to...

268
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
You know, I have all these drugs.

269
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
I have these drugs in different names.

270
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
And I run across and I say,

271
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,640
wow, should I say this is the capability of the drug,

272
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,640
the disposition of the drug, the function of the drug.

273
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,640
And I can draw some pretty clear guidelines into a function of disposition.

274
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,640
But what I mean by this is that capability of disposition or...

275
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,640
So every...

276
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,640
No, no, no.

277
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
To me...

278
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,640
Every capability is a disposition.

279
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,640
So you're always safe to use disposition.

280
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,640
And I think that it's actually going to make your life easier.

281
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,640
You can always use capability if you're not sure what the function is.

282
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,640
So if you know that this pill has the capability to cure depression,

283
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,640
because it says so on the label, then if you're not sure whether that's its function,

284
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,640
then you just put capability.

285
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,640
And the capability will be important later, as we will see.

286
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:51,640
For drugs, it's not so important whether you get the function capability label right.

287
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,640
But for other things, it is important.

288
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:06,640
I could just see differences arising across multiple annotations of local capability

289
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
or the disposition.

290
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
So that would...

291
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,640
And maybe that doesn't matter much, because they're all disposition.

292
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,640
Yeah, exactly.

293
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,640
But I think people might not like that kind of funny,

294
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,640
because they might want their clear, clean lines between their options.

295
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,640
So actually, you are pointing to an issue.

296
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,640
One and the same disposition can be a capability in the eyes of some people

297
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,640
and a mere disposition in the eyes of other people in important ways,

298
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,640
which are a matter of life and death, as we shall see.

299
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,640
So you're right to point out this issue, but I don't think...

300
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,640
I think the issue is so clear that the annotators will not have a problem.

301
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
But we'll see when we get to that.

302
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,640
So this is the diagram.

303
00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:00,640
Now, there are some simple rules which enable you to tack back and forth between capabilities and functions.

304
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,640
So it's very often the case that if a whole has a capability,

305
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,640
then this is because it has some part which has a function.

306
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,640
So my car can play music because I have a stereo system in my car.

307
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:25,640
And my digestive system can digest food, has a function to digest food,

308
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,640
and therefore I can digest food, but that also causes problems.

309
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,640
So I have a capability to digest specific kinds of food,

310
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,640
but my digestive system is generic.

311
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,640
Its function is not to digest specific kinds of food.

312
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,640
That means not that there's anything wrong with the theory,

313
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,640
but that this general rule does not work in general.

314
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,640
It's a general rule because it works often, but it doesn't work always.

315
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,640
All right.

316
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:02,640
So for organisms, we have two kinds of capabilities.

317
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,640
First of all, to survive and to reproduce or anything which promotes both of those, such as eating.

318
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:17,640
Organisms have the capability to convert energy in their environment at ATP.

319
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,640
Is that the correct statement?

320
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:29,640
So organisms have the ability to synthesize ATP.

321
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Because that's necessary for their survival and reproduction.

322
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,640
But then they also have capabilities which go beyond merely biological capabilities.

323
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,640
That's trivial.

324
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Machines have capabilities because organisms have an interest in their doing things.

325
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,640
And those organisms might be the owner of the machine,

326
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,640
or the worker in the factory where the machine is made,

327
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,640
or it might be a patient in an ICU or a passenger.

328
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,640
So there are many kinds of organisms who have many kinds of interests

329
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,640
in the realizations of the capabilities of machines.

330
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,640
Better in the realizations of the dispositions of those machines

331
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,640
and therefore those dispositions are by the definition capabilities.

332
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,640
And then we have great ability.

333
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,640
So we can grade the realizations of capabilities from on a scale.

334
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,640
But that means we also have abnormal realizations,

335
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,640
which are not capabilities, but disabilities.

336
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,640
So shopping addiction, for instance.

337
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,640
If we realize the capability to go shopping too much,

338
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,640
then we have something which is no longer a capability, Simplicita.

339
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:55,640
It's a capability which has to be counterbalanced against the abnormal realization.

340
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,640
And this is true for many capabilities,

341
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,640
that they bring about abnormal side effects, which are not capabilities.

342
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,640
And now we come to Bill's problem, Bill Duncan's problem.

343
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,640
Yeah.

344
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
That's a good question.

345
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,640
I imagine that there are some animals who chased prey too quickly

346
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,640
and suffer from that.

347
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
But I don't know.

348
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,640
So what is a capability in one context may be a disability in another.

349
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,640
So the capability to kill without feelings of guilt.

350
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,640
Normally we would regard that as a disability,

351
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,640
but in the mafia that is regarded as a capability.

352
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,640
And there are many such cases where in one community or one context,

353
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,640
a disposition is regarded as something good in which we have an interest,

354
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,640
and in another context it's regarded as something bad.

355
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,640
Then, okay, so they might regard it as your function,

356
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,640
but they wouldn't be right because in BFO terms it's not your function.

357
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,640
Because it's not your raison d'etre.

358
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,640
All right.

359
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,640
And now here are the areas where capabilities data is going to be important.

360
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,640
First of all, with regard to education and training,

361
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,640
which is why great ability is important,

362
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,640
with regard to hiring and promotion,

363
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,640
all human capital has to do with the capabilities

364
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,640
that the possessor of the human capital has.

365
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Consulting, I believe, is largely a process of increasing,

366
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,640
adding to or increasing the grade of capabilities of organizations.

367
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,640
A capability data is important when you're doing mission planning

368
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,640
in large organizations like military organizations where they have.

369
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,640
In the DOD they have a whole department devoted to keeping track

370
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,640
of the capabilities of different units within the organization.

371
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,640
And then there is the problem of finding capabilities.

372
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,640
So if you work for Google and you want to know whether there's someone in Google

373
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,640
who has some capability that you need to exploit,

374
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
then you have to Google Google.

375
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,640
So people who work for Google Google Google in order to find the people they need.

376
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,640
And similarly, if you work for the NIH or for any kind of large organization

377
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:52,640
where you need people to approve grants or vet decisions,

378
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,640
then you need to find people in your organization

379
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,640
who have certain combinations of capabilities.

380
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,640
And it's very difficult to collect and keep up-to-date data about those things.

381
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,640
And there are whole disciplines of capabilities engineering,

382
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,640
which are part of systems engineering.

383
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:18,640
All right, now very quickly, because Clint is going to talk about this in greater detail,

384
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,640
language is a capability.

385
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:27,640
In fact, that's the definition of language which I want to promote.

386
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:35,640
A language is, so this is a question which we could discuss maybe and maybe Clint resolves it,

387
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,640
it's either a capability or it's an aggregate of capabilities.

388
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,640
And so language is defined as a special kind of competence.

389
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:54,640
But where competence in the Chomsky world is seen as a set of universal innate rules,

390
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,640
universal grammar, we're viewing competence as a matter of capabilities

391
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:05,640
which are realized by people speaking and reading and writing and so forth.

392
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,640
And some of those are innate.

393
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:15,640
Some of the features exemplified when we speak or write or read are innate.

394
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,640
But no language is innate.

395
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,640
Not even English is innate.

396
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,640
All languages have to be learned.

397
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,640
But we have the innate capability to learn some language.

398
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:37,640
But for that, we need parents and kin and dictionaries and teachers and so forth.

399
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,640
There's a category error in the writing part.

400
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Because?

401
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,640
Because in the socialization part, societal norms, they cannot be at the same level as peers.

402
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,640
Yeah, you're right, that's not my picture.

403
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,640
So a definition of language, it's simple.

404
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,640
A language is an aggregate of capabilities of its users.

405
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Now there are problems with this definition.

406
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,640
First of all, it's circular.

407
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,640
But I believe that this is a harmless circularity.

408
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,640
And what we have actually is something like a triple of terms,

409
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,640
each of which can only be defined by reference to the others.

410
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,640
And which triple we choose to take as primitive,

411
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,640
we're going to end up with circularity anyway.

412
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:34,640
So we take the capability term in the triple as primitive,

413
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,640
and we get the others for free as it were.

414
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:45,640
And because we have an independent definition of capability, the definition still works.

415
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:51,640
So I can give you other examples where this same circularity feature is present also

416
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,640
where it proves to be perfectly harmless.

417
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
Topology is a good example.

418
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,640
All right, now in order for an aggregate of linguistic dispositions,

419
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,640
which we call English or Italian or Chinese,

420
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,640
to exist and to be maintained in existence,

421
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,640
there have to be very, very complicated mechanisms.

422
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Mothers and schools and so forth to keep the aggregate of capabilities

423
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,640
going from generation to generation.

424
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,640
All right, a language is an aggregate of capabilities of its users.

425
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,640
Now one nice feature of this definition is that we can define very easily

426
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,640
what a dialect is.

427
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,640
It's a sub-aggregate.

428
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:43,640
So in other words, it's the aggregate of capabilities or competencies

429
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,640
to speak the relevant language in a subset of people,

430
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,640
almost certainly within certain contexts where they speak the specific form of the language,

431
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,640
which is their dialect, rather than the more generic form,

432
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,640
which their parents speak.

433
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,640
So this is a map of Great Britain,

434
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,640
and this is Manchester, which is roughly where I come from.

435
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,640
And in Manchester there are lots of dialects,

436
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,640
which are divided geographically in this way.

437
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:20,640
I come from the rough, well, rough broad area of the northwest,

438
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,640
not from the posh area.

439
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,640
And what this shows, well, this is a, the English language in general

440
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,640
is an instance of the type language,

441
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:34,640
which is a sub-class of the type aggregate of dispositions,

442
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:39,640
which is a sub-class of the type disposition in BFO terms.

443
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:45,640
And then Manchester dialect is an instance of the type dialect.

444
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Actually, it's a collection of dialects, but we'll come to that.

445
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,640
It's an instance of the type dialect, which is a part of language.

446
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:58,640
So every dialect is a part of some language,

447
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,640
in a very, very simple, myriological sense.

448
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,640
And that's because one aggregate of dispositions

449
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,640
is part of another aggregate of dispositions.

450
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,640
And these aggregates of linguistic dispositions

451
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,640
go hand-in-hand very often with aggregates

452
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,640
of non-linguistic dispositions to behave in certain ways,

453
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,640
for instance, to beat people up if they come from Liverpool.

454
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
So...

455
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,640
I'm sure you never did that.

456
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,640
No.

457
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,640
All right, now Sol gets many of these things right.

458
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,640
So this is a long quotation from Sol.

459
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,640
And the point is that my ability to speak English

460
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,640
is based in the physics of my brain

461
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,640
and of my diaphragm and of all the other organs

462
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,640
which are involved in producing speech.

463
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
Which are pictured there.

464
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,640
All right, and now all of this is kept going,

465
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,640
not only if there are people teaching each new generation,

466
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,640
but also if people are correcting and enforcing rules.

467
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Not necessarily rules of good grammar.

468
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,640
They could be enforcing rules of bad grammar

469
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,640
because that's what happens with certain kinds of dialects.

470
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,640
The dialects are there to protect the group.

471
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,640
All right, so these are specifically human capabilities.

472
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
Enforcing rules and so forth.

473
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,640
Teaching, managing, guiding, appointing.

474
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,640
Ah, we don't need that and that's the end.

475
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,640
All right, so how am I doing?

476
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,640
I'm actually, we're back on time.

477
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,640
Believe it or not.

478
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,640
So we have time, I guess, for a few questions,

479
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,640
but we'll move to Clint very quickly.

480
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,640
I just had a question about the barrier of capabilities.

481
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,640
So when you talk about parts of my body having capability

482
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,640
and then I have that capability.

483
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,640
Parts of your body have functions

484
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,640
and therefore you have the corresponding capability.

485
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,640
Okay, okay.

486
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,640
That resolves it.

487
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,640
I was wondering about the migration

488
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,640
and not, SDC's not being migratable.

489
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,640
Like if I donate my kidney to Matt.

490
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,640
Yes, good.

491
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,640
That's a good starting question.

492
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:37,640
So if you donate your kidney to Matt,

493
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,640
then the kidney in Matt still has the function

494
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,640
of cleansing the liquids in your body.

495
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,640
But they have now the capability

496
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,640
of cleansing the liquids in Matt's body.

497
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
Matt's body, but they don't have the function

498
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,640
of cleansing the liquids in Matt's body.

499
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,640
It's the selected...

500
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,640
So the design would take care of the case that was just right.

501
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,640
I don't think that the kidney evolves

502
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,640
when it's shifted from one body to another.

503
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
I don't think we need to do that.

504
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,640
We can use the design for the grown kidney in the lab,

505
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,640
but I don't see why we need it.

506
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,640
It doesn't have...

507
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,640
It still has the function of cleansing blood in his body,

508
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,640
but it has now the capability of cleansing liquids in...

509
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
And the function too.

510
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,640
And the function too, I agree.

511
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
The capability...

512
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,640
It's not...

513
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,640
No, this is the etiological theory.

514
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,640
The function or the capability of an entity

515
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,640
depends on where it comes from.

516
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
So...

517
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Anyway, we can...

518
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,640
I have an issue with the definition of capability

519
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
and the word interest.

520
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,640
So what you're saying is that capability

521
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,640
can only be assigned to an organism that hasn't...

522
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
No, no.

523
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,640
There has to be an organism or a group of organisms

524
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,640
which has an interest in the realization of a disposition

525
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,640
for it to be a capability.

526
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,640
But the disposition could be in another human being,

527
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,640
or it could be in a table or a planet or...

528
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,640
So there are lots of entities,

529
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
kinds of entities have capabilities,

530
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,640
but only the ones where we have some interest.

531
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,640
Capability is an interest-dependent notion,

532
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,640
which is...

533
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,640
This is not that of the organisms that are...

534
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
We ask humans, I guess.

535
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,640
Well, no, the rats and mice have interests

536
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
in the functioning of their parts too,

537
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,640
so they have capabilities.

538
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,640
It's not just humans.

539
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,640
Tables don't have an interest.

540
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,640
No, tables don't have an interest.

541
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,640
Any more?

542
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,640
Okay, so Clint...
