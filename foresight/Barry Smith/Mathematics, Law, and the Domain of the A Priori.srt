00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
I'm going to talk about today is a survey of the ontology of mathematics.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:19,040
I'm going to go through this quickly and so I'll go through the main options in the ontology of mathematics very quickly.

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,680
And then I am going to spend a little bit more time describing the option that Yorbsden and I are developing,

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,280
..which is not completely original..

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,800
..but it's original as applied to mathematics.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,400
It's also original in the sense that it's still new.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,600
Which means that we haven't, by any means, identified all the weak points.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,040
And even the phrasing, in other words, the terminological choices..

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,920
..that we want to make in order to make our view clear..

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,160
..they're still somewhat uncertain.

Theoretic said that to believe that there are mathematical entities is just a mistake now

35
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,820
we can use mathematical symbols to do all kinds of wonderful things but those symbols don't

36
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:05,760
refer to anything and those who think they're referring to something are just making a mistake,

37
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,480
this mistake is a very useful mistake to make but it's a mistake.

38
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:25,200
followed by a related in the sense that there isn't really a festa mindist rather emotemical internetist is a logical system.

39
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Lodgeth is not about anything to say that if p then p or q is not about anything, but it is a valid rule of logic.

40
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Now what logitism says is that mathematics is a branch of logic, and therefore mathematics doesn't say anything, it's not about anything.

41
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:57,200
It gives you certain kinds of rules of inference. We'll say a little bit about that, but we're not going to take it very far.

42
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:14,200
That is the most mature view of mathematics, and the most thoroughly developed, but unfortunately it was also shown to be not workable at different levels.

43
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Now another view, and again I'm not sure this has ever had any defenders in mathematics, but has had defenders in other areas like ethics.

44
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:35,200
It might be called anything that satisfies them, and the idea here is that if you have a complicated theory about ethics for instance,

45
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:46,200
and you don't know what norms or values or good or evil are, then you just present your theory as a collection of axioms,

46
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:55,200
and you say anything that satisfies these axioms is a norm or is a value. I don't know what those things are, and I don't care because I have my axioms.

47
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:07,200
That is a whole programme in philosophy called the camera programme, because it was invented and I think it's still defended by some people in camera.

48
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Platonism, this is probably the oldest but not the most well-developed theory, says that there is a whole realm of mathematical entities which are abstract or atemporal outside our purview.

49
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:43,200
It's not part of the empirical world, and mathematics is about those entities, so mathematicians stare up into this platonic heaven and they decide how to write their axioms, and you do see some mathematicians staring up when they were.

50
00:05:43,200 --> 00:06:04,200
The big problem with this is that we have to explain how it should be that truths about abstract entities in some transcended realm could be so useful when doing physics for instance, and that's the big problem in philosophy of mathematics, namely how do we explain the applicability for mathematics.

51
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:16,200
The final view, and our view will be a sub-view under this heading, although you'll taste the idea that we might be social constructionists. We are good social constructionists.

52
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:33,200
The final view says that mathematical entities are social constructions, and I will give you some examples of bad social constructionism, and then I hope you will be convinced that there is also good social constructionism, and then we will argue that mathematics is one example.

53
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,200
I think there's another option, that is the fictionalism.

54
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Oh yes, you're right. Actually it was on my list, but somehow I did it. Fictionalism is a bit like the error theory. Fictionalism says that mathematical entities are like fictional entities.

55
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:57,200
In fact my very first publication defends of you like that, but in a good way.

56
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Alright, so fictionalism is whenever I use a zoom in the university the internet breaks down.

57
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:22,200
So in order to avoid the consequences of that I'm going to record in the real world rather than in the zoom world.

58
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I'm recording if you want.

59
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,200
You could record it. You are recording. I will record it anyway just for fun.

60
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Ok, now.

61
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Let me get rid of this with any luck.

62
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:56,200
It really likes to live things.

63
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Are there any other questions while we're waiting?

64
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Alright.

65
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Can you say fiction is a kind of social construction?

66
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,200
No, because there's nothing constructed.

67
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Well, I guess so, but that's not going to be an important question.

68
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Logicism, as I say, says mathematics is a branch of logic, so if you could express all the theorems and axioms or all the theories of mathematics in logical terms,

69
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:18,200
then in principle you ought to be able to deduce all of those theorems or all of those axioms from the axioms of logic.

70
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Frager and Russell both believed that this was possible and they both presented their accounts of how you could indeed infer large bodies of mathematics from logic.

71
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:46,200
In Frager's case, Russell showed that Frager's axioms were inconsistent in creating Russell's paradox, which he created just before Frager's main work was about to go to the press.

72
00:09:46,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Frager was able to add a paragraph at the beginning forward in which he said that Mr Russell has suggested to me that there is some problem, but I believe that this problem can be addressed if you just add this extra wrinkle to some axiom.

73
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:15,200
That extra wrinkle did indeed work, but only in a universe which had exactly one object or some crazy restriction.

74
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Russell published his own version, along with Whitehead, and he did a much better job in the sense that he was, as far as we can tell, consistent, but the job that he did was very, very complicated.

75
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:46,200
It was useful in the further development of logicism within the realm of set theory, but it was more complicated than the useful versions of that theory.

76
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:58,200
The useful versions of logicism say that not that all mathematics is a branch of logic, but that all mathematics can be expressed using set theory, the axioms of set theory.

77
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:09,200
A set theory is somewhat more powerful than logic as we understand it, and also set theory has problems with itself.

78
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:18,200
But I know recently there's a song chain called New Fragerism, so some guys may not be able to fix the problem.

79
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:33,200
These things come back. Anything that satisfies this and we've already mentioned, I've mentioned that Whitehead and Russell work in three volumes, it's called Wikipedia Mathematica.

80
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,200
It's an amazing piece of work, but as I say, it became outmoded.

81
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:59,200
A logicism, we've talked about. The next bit is taken from a talk I gave 20, maybe more years ago, hence the real old-fashioned design of my slides compared to the new ones, which are much more modern.

82
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:15,200
I deleted all the animation. This is just an extract, a few slides from this old talk, because economics is one area where social constructionism would seem to be a reasonable choice.

83
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:30,200
But Austrian economics adds a very important dimension to social constructionism, which I will try to explain very quickly, and then later on we'll see the relevance to mathematics.

84
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Carl Mega was the founder of the Austrian School of Economics. He founded a school, some members of which were associated with Austrian philosophers such as Brentana, and so I published a book on the Austrian School of Philosophy, which contends treatments of Austrian economics.

85
00:12:48,200 --> 00:13:14,200
I also published several papers on Austrian economics. The two running threads which joined together the Austrian economists and the Austrian philosophers are a kind of reverence for Aristotle on the one hand, and then a belief in a priorism on the other hand.

86
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:34,200
I will explain the a priorism in due course. Now, Mega had a reference for Aristotle in some of his terminology. He also had a reverence for things which were not Aristotelian in other parts of his writing, so Mega is not a simple programme for any kind of Aristotelian approach.

87
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Now, what is economics for the Austrian School? So the economic domain domain includes things like buying and selling, valuing and pricing, putting a price on something and negotiating in many other things.

88
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:18,200
And if you take the state into account that includes things like taxing and includes banks in the account and includes things like interest rates, loans and so forth, so there are lots of constituent parts of the economic domain and the Austrian School says, well, let's work out what are the necessary dependence relations.

89
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:36,200
So in order for something to have a price, does it have to have a value? I don't know, but in order for something to have a value, the Austrians would say, it has to be such that someone values it, so there have to be things like preferences.

90
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:51,200
So we have a dependence relation between value and preference or between value and wanting. Now, this is a very simple example of what we're going to be calling an a priori law.

91
00:14:51,200 --> 00:15:06,200
And what that means is that it's not a matter of logic. In other words, it's not purely empty. There is some content, some real content there. And it's something which is intelligible.

92
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Anybody who understands what value is in the economic realm and what wanting or preferring is in the economic realm can see that value requires wanting or preferring.

93
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:34,200
This is called subjectivity in the Austrian School. The idea is that things have value only to the degree that the subjects in the relevant society are willing to pay or are willing to barter in order to own those things.

94
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:47,200
And there are many others such a priori dependence relations in the doctrine of the Austrian School, which become very, very sophisticated and have all kinds of implications.

95
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:59,200
I've given another one here. You can't have an exchange without having an exchanger and an exchange. You can't have a buying without having a selling and you can't have a selling without having a buying.

96
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:11,200
There are lots and lots of relations like this. Now, some of them may be analytic in the sense that they are just a matter of definition.

97
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:29,200
But you see, if we take buying and selling, it can't be that both buying and selling are definable in such a way that it becomes analytic that buying requires selling and selling because of buying.

98
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:43,200
You have to start either with buying or with selling. You can define selling in terms of buying, but then you have to accept buying and the features of buying as being something which is not analytic.

99
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,200
And I'll talk a little bit about that as we go along.

100
00:16:48,200 --> 00:17:09,200
This is an example of the kind of analysis that Menga created. For him, a good exists only if there is a need. A good implies value and value exists only if there is some kind of a need, whether this be a basic need or whether it's a need of the moment.

101
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:20,200
For instance, when you see that some film is playing in a cinema and you feel a need to go and see that film, that's not a basic need, but it is a need in the sense of Menga.

102
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,200
A basic need would be the need for food or something.

103
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:46,200
The object has to be searched and you can satisfy that need. There has to be knowledge, so good exists only where there is knowledge. Knowledge of needs and knowledge of causal connections and not necessarily on your part, there could be causal connections on the part of the seller.

104
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:57,200
And a command over the thing so you have the money to buy it. Somebody has a copy to sell.

105
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Now, this a priorism as the Austrian school is defended in Menga, but it's defended in a more radical way in Mises, Ludwig von Mises, who was a famous Austrian economist.

106
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:25,200
First half of the 20th century, with a large school of followers, and he says, and he was influenced by Kant, which may explain why he gets things wrong.

107
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:35,200
He said that there is only one axiom and that all the other axioms are economic to follow from this one axiom, and the axiom is man and act.

108
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:46,200
This is the axiom of action. If we understand action, he says, then we understand need, value and all the other things, analytics. They all follow from this one axiom.

109
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:59,200
And then two of his followers, one from Murray Rothbard. Rothbard, in fact, reviewed the books that I wrote on the Austrian school very friendly.

110
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:18,200
And Hermann Hoppe, he's a German, which is not necessarily a bad thing, who wrote a very nice book, which I like defending sovereignty. It's called something like The Mistake, which is democracy.

111
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,200
And I like some of the thinking of Hoppe.

112
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:40,200
All right, now, so we've already mentioned many of the terms that we're going to need, so something is analytic if it's a truth of logic, and we're talking about truths or propositions or judgments or statements.

113
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:50,200
A truth is synthetic, if it adds to your knowledge, it's not analytic in other words.

114
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Truth is a priori, if it's known independently of experience, which means it's intrinsically intelligible in some way.

115
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:06,200
And a posteriori just means known via experience, and that is the answer.

116
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:14,200
You could have picked a better photo for sure.

117
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Absolutely, I did, but he must have looked like it.

118
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,200
I mean, there are better pictures of it.

119
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,200
As an a priori.

120
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:34,200
So, Kant had the theory of the synthetic a priori, but he thought that he only held for physics.

121
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:43,200
We have synthetic a priori knowledge about time, space, and causality, and that knowledge is called Newtonian mechanics.

122
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:54,200
He thought we knew that a priori, and maybe he's right, but the point I'm going to be making in what follows is that there are many, many other areas

123
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:01,200
that are such that we have a priori knowledge, seemingly, which Kant did not address.

124
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:11,200
So, Kant may have got some aspects of the synthetic a priori right, but he certainly didn't get the scope right.

125
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,200
All right, so I just said that.

126
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Now, I don't want to talk too much about visas on mega, these are just illustrations.

127
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:36,200
This is more important, so this shows the Aristotelian basis of mega's views, and general essence and general connection,

128
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:47,200
they are the two key components of our view of mathematics and physics, actually, when we get to it.

129
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,200
So, in German, that would be Wiesen, and Wiesen's Zusammenhang.

130
00:21:52,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Now, general essence and general, and the general connection of economic phenomena, they sound okay in a sentence like this,

131
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:13,200
but if you try and write about general essence in a paper published in an analytic philosophy journal, which is the only type of philosophical journal which we're publishing in,

132
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,200
then people will just turn up their noses and say this is something old fashioned, so that's our problem.

133
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:27,200
So, we would like to call the synthetic a priori truths, which we are studying, basis of Zusammenhang.

134
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,200
General connections of essences, but we can't because it's German.

135
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,200
So, I want to stick with the synthetic a priori truth.

136
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Because we're not talking about truth anymore, we're talking about things on the side of the mathematical or realm of physics.

137
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Can you call the postulates instead of truths?

138
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,200
That's the same problem. So, postulates are on the side of truths. We want to talk about what is on the side of objects.

139
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:02,200
We want to say that there are essences and essential connections on the side of the objects in themselves, or objects themselves.

140
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,200
And that this is so in mathematics as well as in physics.

141
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:17,200
In mathematics, if anything, even more obviously the case, but in mathematics, the tendency to see things as being analytic is very strong because of logic.

142
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
So, this is another word for it, non-inductive intelligible structures.

143
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Now, we know that every human is born virtually with the capabilities to apprehend, recognise non-inductive intelligible structures.

144
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Differences between colours, for instance, can't be learned. Differences between shapes can't be learned.

145
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Differences between feeling good and feeling bad can't be learned.

146
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,200
And grasp those things innately. They are intrinsically intelligent.

147
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:03,200
And as we get older, more and more of these intrinsically intelligible structures become evident to us.

148
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,200
So, as a result of the fact that we also learn a lot of things very quickly.

149
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Okay, this is Adolf Reiner, who has a much more, much straighter face than that should be.

150
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,200
He was a philosopher of law, who was also a student of Hussal.

151
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:29,200
And in 1913 he published a book, Length Monograph, on the a priori foundations of the civil law.

152
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,200
And it's that which is our model for mathematics.

153
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,200
We want to do the ontology of mathematics based on this Reinachian approach.

154
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:48,200
And I have a lot of slides now about Reinach, but I'll go through them very quickly, so don't be disturbed by the fact that I'm going through them very quickly, because we don't need them most of the time.

155
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Let me say a little bit more about Reinach, just for interest sake.

156
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,200
So, Reinach was sometimes referred to by Hussal's followers, so Reinach was a follower of Hussal.

157
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,200
Hussal founded a school, but there was a group of Hussal's followers in Munich.

158
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,200
And Hussal was in Göttingen, and then in Freiburg, he was not in Munich.

159
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,200
So, the Munich School of Phenomenology is a kind of separate wing.

160
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:26,200
And they were accused by Hussal of practicing what he later on, when he became critical of some of the Munich School work, of practicing picture book phenomena.

161
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:40,200
What that means is they would take a domain like aesthetics or chemistry or ethics or the will, and they would draw phenomenological pictures, diagrams effectively, although they didn't use diagrams,

162
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,200
but they were thinking in a way in which you could capture very well diagrammatically.

163
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:52,200
That's why I like them, incidentally. I like diagrammatically the representations of philosophical views.

164
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,200
That's why I became an ontologist.

165
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:09,200
So, Reinach was almost certainly the cleverest of these people, and he was referred by other people later on, even when he moved to Göttingen to be in the same town,

166
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,200
in the same university, and he was referred to as the phenomenologists.

167
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Because you should go to him if you wanted to know about phenomenology, not to Hussal.

168
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,200
He was a much better teacher.

169
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Now, another person who was in Göttingen is Edith Stein.

170
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,200
And I ought to see if you all know who Edith Stein is.

171
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Edith Stein.

172
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,200
So, she was Hussal's assistant during this period.

173
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,200
She helped Hussal write at least one of his books.

174
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Hussal obviously couldn't give her a job because she was a woman.

175
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:57,200
But she was Jewish, but she converted to Christianity.

176
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,200
But she was sent to a concentration camp.

177
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Her life was a model of singiness, and so, after she died, they made her a saint.

178
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:16,200
So, the Munich school had at least one saint as a member.

179
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:24,200
But actually, it had two, because another member of the Munich school, who was also a friend of Edith Stein and Reinach,

180
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:39,200
was a Polish philosopher called Roman Ingaarden, who applied the Munich phenomenological method to works of art, literature, architecture, music, and so forth, among other things.

181
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:50,200
And one of Ingaarden's friends in Poland, when he went back to Poland, became the Pope, the Polish Pope, who was now a saint.

182
00:27:50,200 --> 00:28:01,200
And the Polish Pope was a professor of philosophy, and he was focusing on Thomas Aquinas and Max Schela.

183
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Max Schela is another member of the Munich school who applied the phenomenological method, in his case, to everything under the sun from aristocracy to war, to the greatness of Germany and the impoverishedness of the grocery in England and so on.

184
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:26,200
So, Schela was fantastically all-encompassing, but his book on his ethics is also fantastic.

185
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:38,200
All right, so this work, like the Speech Act theory of Austen and Stealth, starts out with a promise.

186
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:50,200
The promise is a phenomenon which we're all familiar with and which is obeying a priori look, just like buying and selling.

187
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:57,200
In fact, it's related to buying and selling because there are some promise aspects involved in many economic transactions.

188
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,200
Contracts are promises.

189
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:11,200
And now, this is a very good source book about Reina and the whole Munich school.

190
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Okay, I'll come back to Reina in a minute. Let me just talk about social constructionism.

191
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:23,200
First of all, it's a big bad, ugly vegetable garden with different kinds of views.

192
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,200
A very illustrative account of this big bad vegetable garden is by Ian Hacking.

193
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,200
It's called the social construction of what.

194
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:40,200
And some of the examples he deals with in that book are facts, gender, quarks, madness, reality and so on.

195
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:47,200
So, the idea that madness is socially constructed would turn on the fact that particular terms like hysteria,

196
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,200
which were very common in the Victorian times but which are now completely not used,

197
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:00,200
would suggest that what those particular terms referred to was a worse social construction.

198
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,200
That's the kind of idea, always a historical idea in Hacking,

199
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:14,200
that Hacking uses to characterise, identify social constructions.

200
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:21,200
All right, now, I'm going to talk a little bit about In-Garden

201
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:32,200
because this will give us a clone to the complexity that can be found on the side of socially constructed entities.

202
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Now, the whole world of works of art is clearly socially constructed.

203
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,200
There are clearly different tastes at different times in the history of art,

204
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:50,200
which makes certain things beautiful to one generation that would not necessarily be beautiful to another generation.

205
00:30:50,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Now, In-Garden's approach to unpacking the ontological structure of a work of art is in terms of what he calls strata.

206
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:10,200
So, a work of art for In-Garden has strata which we need to apprehend in order to apprehend the work as a whole,

207
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
but we apprehend them as a unity.

208
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,200
This is a work of literature. We have phonetic formations.

209
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:29,200
In other words, when we read a poem or a novel, then we read in such a way that we read the words as being spoken with a given accent.

210
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,200
For instance, if we read a novel in which there is a German or a Russian character,

211
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:44,200
we may hear the German or the Russian accent, but in any case, there are sounds afoot in the literary work.

212
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:52,200
If you don't have any sound associations when you read a work, then you're not getting the full body of the work as an aesthetic object.

213
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,200
Then there are meanings, simple meanings and complex meanings of all the sentences and paragraphs and so on.

214
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Then there are what In-Garden calls schematised aspects.

215
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:09,200
So, we are presented with the hero as having long black hair, but we're not presented.

216
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:16,200
We don't know how long, and we don't know whether it's genuinely black or whether it's dyed, so that it's schematised aspects.

217
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:26,200
That means that we don't know everything. We only know certain things, a finite number of things about the places and people and actions presented in the work.

218
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Then there are those places and people and actions and states of affairs which are presented in the work, and they form a stratum in and of themselves.

219
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:45,200
In some cases, there will be value qualities and metaphysical qualities which you apprehend when you read it.

220
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:52,200
The In-Garden has a very complicated account of what it is to read a literary work.

221
00:32:53,200 --> 00:33:00,200
What the work is depends also upon the readings that take place.

222
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:08,200
He has a theory of the literary work of art as being a product of human intentions.

223
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,200
Now, that's a kind of social construction.

224
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:21,200
So, if you just throw a lot of ink on paper and it comes out with words, to be words, by whatever means,

225
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:29,200
but no, it's never sold, it's never given to anybody as a novel, then it does not exist as a literary work.

226
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,200
A literary work exists only if there is a readership.

227
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:39,200
Now, it may be that no one reads it anymore, but still it exists because there was once a readership.

228
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:47,200
So, it's a social construction because the readership is a social entity.

229
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,200
And the author is relatively insignificant.

230
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,200
So, the author doesn't decide what the meanings are or what the schematised aspects are.

231
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:03,200
I accept, insofar as he gives all the clues that you can ever get when he writes the novel.

232
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,200
It's the readers who make those decisions.

233
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,200
Clearly, they'll be guided by what the author says, and they will share lots of assumptions that the author shares,

234
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,200
but they may also have different assumptions.

235
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,200
All right, so, an example, well, now I won't do the next one.

236
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Now, music has only two aspects, or in some cases only one.

237
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,200
So, we're talking now about, not about opera, but about synthesis of one second.

238
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:40,200
And some works of music have value qualities, they have a kind of metaphysical quality about them.

239
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,200
But, basically, what music is characterised by, and here is an error,

240
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:52,200
is not by words sounds as it says here, but by sound.

241
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:59,200
So, the work of music is a sound formation, a big one.

242
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Yes, Carmella.

243
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,200
Are readers or audiences co-agents?

244
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,200
It comes down to that, yes.

245
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,200
It's not symmetry.

246
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:27,200
So, basically, in Garden has a view according to which the work of art has a life.

247
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:34,200
It's born when the author pushes the manuscript on the publisher's desk, or a bit later than that,

248
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:41,200
and it dies when the planet is annihilated or everyone stops reading it.

249
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,200
And during that time, the readers determine what the significance, meaning, the sounds even.

250
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:52,200
So, Shakespeare, we hear now, if it's performed today, may be in a kind of old-fashioned English.

251
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:59,200
But still, it's English, where in Shakespeare's day, the accent that people spoke in England

252
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,200
was a combination of what is today Yorkshire and Danish.

253
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,200
And that's quite different from what the way we hear Shakespeare now,

254
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:15,200
and that means that Shakespeare's plays have, in their life, evolved to be different today

255
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,200
from what they were in the olden days that Mark created.

256
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
And the examples come from set theory.

257
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:30,200
The best example of autonomous mathematical objects, I say, are the numbers.

258
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:37,200
And so, the German mathematician Chronica had a saying, which has been repeated many times,

259
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,200
God made the natural numbers. All the rest is the work of man.

260
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,200
So, I'm defending the... something like the Chronica theory.

261
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:54,200
And then, the second paper I published was on the same topic, actually, I was already boring.

262
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:02,200
So, I just went into more details about the historical aspect of mathematics,

263
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:09,200
although I didn't really say any of the things that Jobs and I want to say now about the history of mathematics,

264
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,200
because I was working with a rather narrowly constrained phenomenological framework.

265
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:20,200
I was working to find a way of applying Ingarth's ideas to mathematical entities.

266
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,200
And then, the third paper I will mention, all of this is within the 1970s.

267
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:33,200
These were the... I think this was not the third paper I published.

268
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:43,200
This paper is about this relation between representations on the one hand and the real world now.

269
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:50,200
And so, there is this picture. It was really published.

270
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:56,200
It didn't force me to make a real print quality graphic, unfortunately.

271
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:02,200
So, that's the real world down there, and the real world, of course, includes consciousness.

272
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,200
And the graphic doesn't even capture that very well.

273
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,200
And because there is consciousness, there are all kinds of targets of intentionality.

274
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Now, some of these targets of intentionality, which are in the inner suburbs, if you like, might exist.

275
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:29,200
So, for instance, the snow-smoking zone in a restaurant that's socially constructed, if it really exists,

276
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Poland really exists, that's socially constructed.

277
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:42,200
But some of the things in the outer suburbs are dependent for their ontological status exclusively upon consciousness.

278
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:47,200
And examples would be fictional characters.

279
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Now, the question is where mathematics goes.

280
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:58,200
In the earlier papers, I had an argument for the role for two kinds of mathematical entities.

281
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,200
But this is about all the different kinds of entities that we can be directed towards in our mental experience.

282
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:11,200
Some of them are autonomous, some of them are intentional, but they really exist, like Poland,

283
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
and some of them are purely intentional.

284
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:20,200
So, they can be targets, but they don't exist in any sense, such as Hamlet in play,

285
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,200
or better Sherlock Holmes in the novel.

286
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Now, this is a slightly richer diagram, so it's a better diagram.

287
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:42,200
So, the inner suburbs now are counted as parts of the real world, but the parts of it here are still dependent upon consciousness.

288
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:51,200
And these are intentional, so the rocks and the planets are autonomous, but everything above the line is intentional.

289
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:58,200
And the outer suburbs then are fictional, basically.

290
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Now, how many people have heard of intuitionism as a philosophy of mathematics?

291
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
A couple of you, three.

292
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:17,200
So, intuitionism is one of the classic positions that people developed in the philosophy of mathematics.

293
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:24,200
After the failure of Frege, people wanted a more grounded foundation for mathematics.

294
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
They wanted to have certainty.

295
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,200
Frege thought he had certainty, but the whole thing plopped.

296
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Frege is fantastic, his contributions are fantastic, but his account of logicism was a failure,

297
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,200
and therefore his account of mathematics is a failure.

298
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Brower and Heiting developed their own peculiar way of shoring up the safety of mathematical claims,

299
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:02,200
and the way he said, we can only believe in mathematical objects if we've constructed them in a construction,

300
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:09,200
and a construction is a kind of proof, so you can construct numbers by counting to them.

301
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:17,200
There were some extreme followers of this kind of view who said that since we can't count to, let's say, 600 billion,

302
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,200
600 billion is already infinite.

303
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:27,200
They were called finitists, and the leader of the finitist movement is now dead, I assume.

304
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:33,200
This was called Yes it involved it, and maybe there were no other members.

305
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:43,200
Brower and Heiting were much better than finitism, so they developed a version of calculus on intuitionist lines.

306
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:54,200
The main way of understanding intuitionism is to find out that it implies that we cannot believe in the law of excluded middle.

307
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:08,200
The law of excluded middle says that if you've proved that not P, then you can infer that P, and that fails for intuitionism,

308
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:19,200
because you might have a constructed proof that not P, but no constructed proof that P, and you can only assert P when you have a constructed proof.

309
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:30,200
This is a very interesting idea, so some of you will know that I studied with Michael Dummit in Oxford,

310
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:38,200
and I attended a whole terms worth of lectures by Dummit on the intuitionistic calculus,

311
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:43,200
which is like doing calculus with one hand tied behind your back,

312
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:49,200
but you learn a lot if you have to do calculus without using the law of excluded middle.

313
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:57,200
Now, but it died, basically. There are very few people who believe in intuitionism as a movement anymore,

314
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:05,200
but it became a settled part of what you might call the lattice of mathematical options.

315
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:17,200
If you regard a mathematical theory, so I say lattice, I could say Boolean algebra,

316
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:23,200
I suppose we have each approach to mathematics, sees mathematics as a Boolean algebra,

317
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:31,200
then you can see the intuitionistic mathematics as a special kind of Boolean algebra, a weaker Boolean algebra,

318
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:40,200
and to be precise, it's a relatively pseudo-complemented pseudo-Boolean algebra.

319
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:47,200
Pseudo-complemented means that if you know A and you know not A,

320
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,200
then you don't know that you've filled the whole space of options.

321
00:43:51,200 --> 00:44:00,200
That's not quite right, but anyway, I won't say any more, you can work it out for yourself.

322
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:08,200
All right, so this paper I published, this is chronic, my example were Cantor set theory,

323
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:14,200
and then there are transfinite cardinals. So Cantor set theory is a theory of sets, it works very well for.

324
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:19,200
Finite sets, people show that it works very well for infinite sets,

325
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:29,200
but now you get a lot of freedom in creating more and more types of really, really big infinite sets.

326
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:38,200
Clearly, there are different paths you can take in building bigger and bigger infinite sets,

327
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:44,200
and it seemed to me intuitive that some of those paths might be leading to truth,

328
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,200
but at least some of them, and you could make a fake one if necessary,

329
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,200
at least some of them are not leading to truth.

330
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:59,200
So transfinite cardinals of this sort, just a very messy sort,

331
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:05,200
but one clue whether a particular branch of set theory is useful, or is real,

332
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:12,200
it's about real things, is whether it's useful, and some transfinite set theories are useful

333
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:19,200
for physics or in some other economic field, and so they probably are about real mathematical sets,

334
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,200
some of them are not useful, and they might be good candidates for being fictional,

335
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,200
so it's beautiful fictional mathematics.

336
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:36,200
All right, now the next topic we have to deal with is structuralism.

337
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:43,200
So if we want to say that pi is a socially constructed entity,

338
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,200
we still have to say what kind of entity it is.

339
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:52,200
Here the plate in his view is still embraced by many people,

340
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,200
including by many mathematicians consciously or not,

341
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:03,200
but another view which is embraced explicitly in a number of very influential publications is structuralism,

342
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,200
and this says that mathematical entities are structures,

343
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:13,200
and the locus classicus of this view, which is also the first paper I read in the philosophy of mathematics

344
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,200
when I started studying philosophy of mathematics in Oxford,

345
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,200
is that by a man called Benasirath, this is a classic of the philosophy of mathematics,

346
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:28,200
and his idea is you take Russell's theory of what numbers are,

347
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,200
and you take, I think this is Cantor's theory of what numbers are,

348
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:40,200
and so three is the set consisting of zero, one, two, and so forth,

349
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,200
and you get two logically incompatible accounts of what numbers are,

350
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:51,200
both of which have perfectly good application, there's no difference in the degree to which they're useful.

351
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,200
There are many other accounts of what numbers are, you could generate your own theory,

352
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:02,200
and so Benasirath concluded that numbers are none of these things,

353
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:09,200
rather we have a certain structure which we could call the number structure,

354
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,200
and this number structure is exemplified here and there,

355
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,200
and in all of the other various candidate accounts of what numbers are.

356
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:29,200
So numbers are nodes in structures, and they are probably themselves structures.

357
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,200
Everything is a structure from the point of view of structuralism.

358
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:43,200
Now, we, Ylfynai Embrace, structuralism, but we do not hold that all of mathematics are structures,

359
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:49,200
we think that would be, that would be turtles all the way down,

360
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:59,200
and so we want to have some basis, some vision, some essence upon which the vision is examining

361
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:05,200
at the combinations of vision which are represented standardly and set theory terms could rest,

362
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:13,200
and so our resting places are going to be zero, one, and maybe the line or the point,

363
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,200
and various other unitary things, so non-structures,

364
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,200
which will be the basic elements out of which the structures are built.

365
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:28,200
So we're not classical structuralists, we are structuralists with bottom.

366
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,200
All right.

367
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,200
I think Noah has a question.

368
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,200
Yes.

369
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,200
So are natural numbers standard in the grounding?

370
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,200
No, just zero and one, because once you've got zero and one,

371
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,200
you can get all the others, basically by adding one, and adding one again.

372
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,200
Zero and one, and what else?

373
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,200
Well, we don't know.

374
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:57,200
We almost certainly will never know everything about what constitutes the bottom.

375
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,200
I know things that you can do it with just zero and one, but I'm fighting.

376
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,200
Why wouldn't you be able to?

377
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,200
I just have this feeling in my phone.

378
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,200
How do we get the circle?

379
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,200
What is stopping us?

380
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:20,200
Is there any errors that we face when we just go down to zero and one?

381
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:26,200
We need to be able to construct the circle, and it's hard to see how you do that from zero and one.

382
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,200
Yes.

383
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,200
Can we say on empty side is a circle structure?

384
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,200
A what?

385
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,200
Empty side.

386
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,200
Is empty side a structure?

387
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,200
I can't hear it.

388
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,200
Empty set a structure?

389
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,200
Empty set.

390
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,200
Yeah.

391
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:46,200
When York talks about these things, he identifies zero, empty set, and the null operator.

392
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,200
He thinks they're all the same.

393
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:55,200
And then he has one, the set, which you can say is the empty set as its only member.

394
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,200
And the progressive operator.

395
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,200
Yeah, you had it on a different side, yeah.

396
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,200
Yes?

397
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,200
Zero and one are...

398
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,200
If they're doing a ground name, where do they exist?

399
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,200
So, that's a very good question.

400
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,200
I would...

401
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,200
What if I exist?

402
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,200
So, zero and one are going to have to be created.

403
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,200
They're going to have to be socially constructed.

404
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,200
So, there are two kinds of mathematical entities.

405
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:34,200
Those which are socially constructed are the initial, in other words, as part of the ground.

406
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:47,200
And those which are socially constructed with the help of one or other structural combinatoric relations.

407
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:53,200
And part of our ontology mathematics includes structure-generating relations, like set-all.

408
00:50:53,200 --> 00:51:02,200
And the idea, the historical idea, would be that they'd discover pi, and then they'd discover...

409
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:13,200
Or, roughly at the same time, they'd discover all of the geometrical relations that you can construct with compass and ruler.

410
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:19,200
But first, they'd discover how to construct those things, but they didn't do it in the right order.

411
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:26,200
So, they discovered pi before they knew of anything about irrational numbers or about sets.

412
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:32,200
But if you reimagine the history of mathematics so that things are discovered in the right order,

413
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:39,200
then you get a chain from the very, very simple mathematics to the more complicated.

414
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:49,200
And then our basic theory says that the principle driver in creating more and more complicated mathematics is physics.

415
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:59,200
So, as physics develops, engineering develops, people's inventions develop, they need more and more complicated mathematics.

416
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:07,200
That forces the development of more and more complicated forms of mathematics, and thereby mathematics then continues to develop.

417
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,200
And that's what's happened since about Galileo's time.

418
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:22,200
There's no worry about a structure-generating and apocalyptic event where enough of us die, and the only remaining people are like the Amazonian tribes.

419
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,200
And do you really want to say those numbers are out of existence?

420
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:32,200
Yes, so I'm afraid I don't have any choice.

421
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,200
I don't want to say it, but I think it seems like...

422
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,200
What are the chances of aliens being...

423
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,200
So, as long as there are records left...

424
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,200
I mean, we need to leave it like that.

425
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,200
Can you imagine another planet away from here?

426
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,200
Yes, so that is a problem.

427
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,200
So, let's go through your possible scenario.

428
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:02,200
So, one scenario is that all records and all civilisation is destroyed on Earth,

429
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,200
but there are tribes who survived after a few generations.

430
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,200
They recreate mathematics, but they do it differently in whatever way.

431
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:16,200
Maybe they do it inconsistently with what we did, but maybe they repeat.

432
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:22,200
So, they invent part. Is it the same mathematical entity, or is it a different one?

433
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:28,200
If you're a Platonist, the answer to that question is easy, if you're a social constructionist as well.

434
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:34,200
I don't know if I'm just one of those questions for which I have no answer.

435
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:41,200
Now, exactly the same case would be if, on Mars, they did the Martian's Development and Mathematics,

436
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,200
which happened to discover part, would it be the same?

437
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:51,200
The temptation is to say it would be the same, but that's because Platonism is always the temptation.

438
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,200
Yes?

439
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,200
So, is it not necessary that pie will be different?

440
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,200
No, it's not necessary at all.

441
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:09,200
For many thousands of years of existence of human beings, they didn't discover part.

442
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,200
It took time.

443
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,200
We see it as being rather trivial, but it wasn't quite complicated to reach that point.

444
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:22,200
It's complicated to reach the point where you could recognise that a hypotenuse on the right angle of triangle

445
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:29,200
is not necessarily going to be measurable for the real number.

446
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,200
Yes?

447
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,200
So, now, zero, one, pie are constructed.

448
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:44,200
No, zero and one are ground stones, they're foundations then. Pie is constructed.

449
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,200
Wait, they're ground stones, but didn't we also create it?

450
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,200
Yes, we'll have to lay the foundations ourselves.

451
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,200
Yes, so create it.

452
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:57,200
But are there a priori los where nothing is constructed?

453
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:10,200
So, once we create certain mathematical entities, then certain intelligible truths are forced upon us, really.

454
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:15,200
It's not that we create them, it's that we're forced upon us.

455
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,200
And now, this is always complicated at the time that the things didn't happen in the right order,

456
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:28,200
but the people who invented pie knew very well as a matter of a priori truth that pie is the ratio

457
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,200
between the circumference and the diameter of the circle, because that's how they discovered it.

458
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,200
That's what it was meant to be, so that's almost one of it.

459
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:44,200
But then they discovered various other relations involving pie, and they proved to themselves,

460
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:51,200
using the Ythelian methods that those relations hold universally for all circles,

461
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:59,200
and that means that they had more a priori truths and a priori knowledge about pie

462
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,200
as the geometry, geometric understanding developed.

463
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,200
So, we don't make the syndeticate priori, all right?

464
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:11,200
Truths, we discover them after we've made the objects which they're about.

465
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:17,200
And this, when I get to the law, this will become clear. Anyone?

466
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:25,200
All right, so this structuralist that I recommend that you read is Scott, Stu Shapiro in Ohio.

467
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:35,200
There is a Stu Shapiro in Buffalo. I have to make it clear which Stu Shapiro I am referring to.

468
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:47,200
So, I think he's right about the first two, but that he's wrong when he says just here.

469
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,200
For him, it is structures all the way.

470
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:54,200
All right, so now we're going to develop Ryanachian structuralism,

471
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:59,200
and we're going to start off where Ryanach started, which is in the ontology of law.

472
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:07,200
And as I said, he invented in 1913 much of the act, but it is simultaneously a speech act.

473
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,200
So, it's not that you have a mental act which you could formulate in words,

474
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:18,200
a mental act which is formulated in words, and in the case of the promise, it has to be formulated in words.

475
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:25,200
Visa vi, the promisee, so the promisee has to register that you have made a promise,

476
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,200
otherwise you haven't made a promise.

477
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:32,200
And all of that is a priorite, a synthetic a priorite.

478
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,200
And Ryanach recognized that.

479
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:45,200
So, and Austin had glimpses of that, but they didn't want to embrace the doctrine that there is a synthetic a priorite truth.

480
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:51,200
So, Ryanach is indeed a synthetic a priorite structure, which is what Ryanach is all about.

481
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,200
Ryanach is about the synthetic a priorite structures realized in these sorts of cases,

482
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:02,200
and also in many other sorts of cases which go to form the law.

483
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:12,200
So, he developed a whole ontology of social reality, which he expressed in terms of the collective imposition of function.

484
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:19,200
He is a president, which is a physical thing, but we imposed upon the president the function of ruling the country.

485
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,200
That was a collective imposition of function.

486
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,200
And so, that is the theory of everything in social reality.

487
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,200
It's always a matter of collective imposition of function.

488
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,200
And so, we can do it on objects.

489
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:37,200
So, we can do it with cathedrals, we can do it with driver's licenses, we can do it with dollar bills.

490
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:43,200
And this is all captured in this slogan or formula.

491
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:51,200
So, a cathedral, about building counts as a cathedral in context, if there is a bishop and so on.

492
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:59,200
So, this human being counts as a president because we have collected the imposition of function upon this.

493
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,200
And this doesn't work.

494
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,200
So, I am one of the few people who showed Searle that he was wrong.

495
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,200
So, he printed a correction.

496
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:16,200
It doesn't work as a general theory of social entities because a debt is a social entity.

497
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:21,200
But there is nothing upon which we collectively impose a function.

498
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:32,200
If you write IOU on such and such, then the debt note is fitting with Searle's formula.

499
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:40,200
But if I just say I promise to give Ali a hundred dollars tomorrow,

500
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:50,200
I should let's say 18,000 dollars a year in six months, which is not actually the end.

501
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:54,200
I signed paperwork, or I will be signing paperwork.

502
00:59:54,200 --> 01:00:01,200
The other person who has to release the money has not signed yet.

503
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,200
So, I just promise to Ali.

504
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,200
And therefore, I have an obligation to Ali.

505
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:15,200
But my obligation is not a piece of reality, a piece of stone or plastic,

506
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,200
organic material upon which I impose a function.

507
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,200
So, Searle is wrong and he abandoned this formula.

508
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,200
He said he never meant it here.

509
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:31,200
He abandoned this formula because of what I call freestanding y terms.

510
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,200
So, x counters y.

511
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:38,200
There are some x's which are social entities for which there is no y.

512
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:43,200
Sorry, y counters x, so there are some entities in the social world, some y's,

513
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:49,200
which are not such that there is an x of grounding upon which they rest.

514
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,200
So, they are freestanding y terms.

515
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:57,200
But you can think of it as quasi abstract.

516
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,200
And now, I don't think I need to.

517
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,200
So, the obligations and so on nowadays, we record them on paper,

518
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:06,200
but in the olden days, they were recorded in people's memory.

519
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:13,200
Now, a couple of years back, there was a man called Julian Cole,

520
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,200
who was a professor in Buff State, a professor of philosophy.

521
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,200
And every year also, he would come to you and give a talk

522
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:24,200
about social construction of mathematics.

523
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,200
And every year, I really attacked him.

524
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,200
He always came back for more.

525
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,200
I now think he was right.

526
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,200
So, it just shows.

527
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,200
So, this is the first of a series of paper.

528
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,200
Actually, I think there were two earlier ones,

529
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,200
but this is the first of a series of paper.

530
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:50,200
So, he is basically re-creating some of the things I said

531
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,200
in the Anthropogenesis of Mathematical Objects paper.

532
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,200
We're doing it much better, much more statistically.

533
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,200
He captures the creativity and the freedom of mathematics.

534
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,200
The big problem is the authority.

535
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,200
So, how do you get authority for your mathematics in this country?

536
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:15,200
And now, which is the money phrase in this.

537
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:20,200
So, we have to authenticate the ontological commitments

538
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,200
of mathematical theories without curtailing

539
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:27,200
mathematicians' freedom to creatively introduce

540
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,200
mathematical ontology.

541
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,200
I argue that these two constraints are best met

542
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:38,200
by a metaphysical interpretation of mathematics

543
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,200
that takes mathematical entities

544
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,200
to be constitutively constructed.

545
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:47,200
By that, he doesn't mean much more than socially constructed.

546
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,200
Then, in the next paper, he brings in the dimension of institutions,

547
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,200
which is what I've been pointing to

548
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,200
when I talk about social memory and recordings

549
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,200
which I've developed over time.

550
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,200
Notice he uses the freestanding term.

551
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,200
I'm not sure he got it for me,

552
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,200
but it's nice that he's introduced to serve

553
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,200
representational functions.

554
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:18,200
Now, he's describing this institutional reality

555
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,200
and the meta-ontology, whatever that means,

556
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,200
arguing that the philosophy of mathematics

557
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,200
that has its central thesis,

558
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,200
sorry, its central tenet,

559
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,200
this can account for the objectivity, necessity

560
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,200
and the atemporality of mathematics.

561
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,200
Now, these are the things which I was arguing with him about.

562
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:46,200
I said you cannot ground the necessity of mathematical truth

563
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,200
in a social construction account

564
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,200
of the ways mathematical entities begin to exist

565
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,200
because, particularly, you take creativity

566
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,200
and these other things if you can,

567
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,200
you can't creatively create the necessary truth.

568
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,200
Now, I think what I would say now

569
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,200
is that you can creatively constrain,

570
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,200
create a mathematical object

571
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,200
and by you describe it in a certain way,

572
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:18,200
it's the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter

573
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:21,200
and then you can infer necessary truth

574
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,200
from your description, which is an axiom.

575
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,200
That's what I would say now.

576
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,200
All right, and then the third one is called

577
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,200
social construction mathematics

578
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,200
and the collective imposition of function onto reality.

579
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,200
So he's really being surly in here,

580
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:43,200
except he's following my freestanding correction of sir.

581
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,200
Stereotypes of social construction suggest

582
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,200
that the existence of social constructions is accidental

583
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:52,200
and that such constructs have arbitrary and subjective features.

584
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,200
Here I explore a conception, so on.

585
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,200
In particular, I argue that the collective imposition of function

586
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,200
is typically non-accidental

587
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,200
and the products of such imposition frequently

588
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,200
have non-arbitri and objective features.

589
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:17,200
Now, this is, I think, where he addresses a really difficult point.

590
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,200
So when we created pi,

591
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,200
there were objective features of reality

592
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,200
that we had to confront, namely circles.

593
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,200
And we couldn't draw perfect circles,

594
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,200
but we could draw very nearly perfect circles.

595
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,200
And when we constructed pi,

596
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:39,200
we were indeed bending to those necessary features of reality.

597
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,200
But then a place in this can say,

598
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,200
Aha!

599
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:48,200
What you mean by pi is a necessary feature of reality,

600
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,200
which was there already,

601
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,200
because, as we placens know,

602
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,200
mathematical entities are a temple.

603
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,200
They're not created by people.

604
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,200
So there's an issue here.

605
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,200
How do we distinguish the mathematical entity

606
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,200
from the features of reality

607
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:08,200
which have non-arbitri and objective?

608
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:14,200
So that's an issue that Yorkson and I have to address.

609
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,200
I won't talk about document acts.

610
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:28,200
So Rhina has a very complicated ontology of social acts

611
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:32,200
of which speech acts, like promising are one example,

612
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,200
and of the parts of social acts

613
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:40,200
and of whether the underlying experiences,

614
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,200
the underlying mental content,

615
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,200
are states or processes,

616
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:48,200
and whether they need to be addressed to other people,

617
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,200
whether they need to be registered by their addresses.

618
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,200
The founding relation is that you can't marry somebody

619
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,200
unless you have a certain authority.

620
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,200
All of these are a prior issues.

621
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,200
What they give rise to.

622
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:08,200
So a promise gives rise to a mutually correlated claim

623
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,200
and obligation, for instance.

624
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,200
And then the entities which have to obtain

625
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:23,200
in order for the social acts to take place.

626
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,200
And such adds relations of authority.

627
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,200
That's an entity.

628
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,200
And then other parts of social acts.

629
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,200
So when you make a promise,

630
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,200
there has to come into being a disposition on your part

631
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,200
to realize the promise.

632
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,200
Otherwise you didn't make a promise.

633
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,200
So the promise is necessarily dependent on the disposition

634
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,200
on the part of the promise.

635
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,200
All of these are a prior laws.

636
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,200
And you can represent them in diagrams.

637
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,200
And then once you have these diagrams,

638
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,200
you can see that there are modifications.

639
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:58,200
So there are different kinds of sham promises, for instance.

640
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:02,200
And different kinds of collective social acts.

641
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,200
And the modifications occur because some elements here

642
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,200
are missing.

643
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,200
So maybe that no one registers the promise.

644
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,200
Or maybe that there's no sincere attention.

645
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,200
Or it may be that no action follows.

646
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,200
You never actually fulfil the promise.

647
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,200
And so no trust.

648
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,200
That's another dimension.

649
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,200
And you can apply the whole thing,

650
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,200
which is very similar to the case of commanding.

651
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,200
Commanding is just switching.

652
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:31,200
The commander-commandee relation

653
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:35,200
so that it becomes a commandee-commandee relation.

654
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,200
All right.

655
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,200
Now, the most important of all of these,

656
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,200
all of these social acts,

657
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,200
is the act of enactment.

658
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,200
And if you have a dollar bill,

659
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,200
anyway, if you have a pound, a British pound,

660
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,200
now you see that there is a declaration

661
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:55,200
from the Governor of the Bank of England

662
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,200
that he will pay the bearer of this pound note,

663
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,200
one pound.

664
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,200
And then there's a signature underneath.

665
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,200
Now, when that signature was made,

666
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,200
when the relevant actor,

667
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,200
then the pound note came into existence,

668
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,200
both that particular instance and the genre,

669
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,200
the type of document.

670
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,200
And it came into existence through enactment.

671
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,200
And this enactment had a mathematical dimension

672
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,200
because a pound note was then,

673
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:29,200
in the good old days, worth exactly 240 pence.

674
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:34,200
And you could even make it worth 480 hapenies,

675
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,200
which is a half pence.

676
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,200
And that's important for some of the entities

677
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,200
which are brought into being by enactment,

678
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,200
which are very important, particularly in the economic domain,

679
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:47,200
namely that you can divide them mathematically

680
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,200
into perfectly equal fractions.

681
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,200
So, this is the first paragraph

682
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,200
of the German civil code,

683
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,200
which Reina wrote a lot about.

684
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:02,200
And it tells us how a subject of rights begins to exist.

685
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,200
But it doesn't tell us as a fact.

686
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:10,200
It enacts a social fact.

687
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:16,200
The social phenomenon of a thing that is subject to rights

688
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:19,200
begins to exist at the completion of birth

689
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,200
as a result of this enactment.

690
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:26,200
So, it makes the entity, namely an organism subject to rights.

691
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:31,200
And that is the model for how mathematical entities currently exist.

692
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,200
It's a matter of enactment.

693
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:39,200
And here, the enactment is towards all the subjects in the society,

694
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,200
in Germany in this case.

695
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,200
And in mathematics, the enactment would be to all the subjects

696
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,200
engaged in a particular kind of mathematics,

697
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,200
both present and future.

698
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,200
All right, we don't need this.

699
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:55,200
Now, when we think about enactments,

700
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,200
then we realise that there are three sorts of history

701
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,200
that an entity can have.

702
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:06,200
So, numbers, if you're a Platonist or a believer in Chronica,

703
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:12,200
have an atemporal or, what's the word?

704
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,200
Omnitemporal exists.

705
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,200
They exist all the time. They never change.

706
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,200
They don't have any causal features at all.

707
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:23,200
And then you have Bill Clinton, who's changing all the time.

708
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,200
And that's true of all other organisms, buildings,

709
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:33,200
everything in the real world of what happens and is the case.

710
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,200
They're subject to constant changes through time.

711
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,200
And they have a beginning to exist in time,

712
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:41,200
and he, even Bill, will die in some stage.

713
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,200
19 minutes or so later, he will cease to exist.

714
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,200
Or maybe he'll have a bit of a longer time,

715
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:51,200
but he will die sometime.

716
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,200
But now Clinton's presidency is different from these.

717
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:59,200
Clinton's presidency began to exist at a certain point in time.

718
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:02,200
It existed, and then it ceased to exist.

719
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:07,200
And this is characteristic of the way in which entities,

720
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,200
which are inactive, exist.

721
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:14,200
They are part of history, but they do not change.

722
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:18,200
They just come into existence, exist, and then go out of existence.

723
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:22,200
Now, mathematical entities may never go out of existence,

724
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,200
so they may just have this part.

725
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,200
They make this go on forever.

726
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,200
But certainly things like presidencies, obligations,

727
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:35,200
debts, permissions, and the like, they have this shape.

728
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:39,200
And all offices, being senator, being...

729
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,200
Yes?

730
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,200
Are universals like one?

731
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,200
Yes.

732
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,200
Well, so that is...

733
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,200
some universals are like one.

734
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,200
Are universals dependent on their existence,

735
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,200
on the existence of existence?

736
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:00,200
Yes, so I don't want to go into that story,

737
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,200
although it would be a story that we have to go into

738
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:05,200
in the ultimate statement of history.

739
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,200
But, yes, it's a good question,

740
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,200
which means I don't have a good answer.

741
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,200
I will have a good answer.

742
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:21,200
All right, so in the first group we have necessary objects.

743
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,200
In the second group we have contingent objects,

744
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,200
caught up in the world of causality.

745
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:30,200
And in the third group we have objects which are intelligible,

746
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,200
but have a starting point in time.

747
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:44,200
And so I think that Reina deserves to be honoured

748
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:48,200
to a much greater degree than he is,

749
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,200
because I believe he was the first philosopher ever

750
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,200
to recognise that there are objects of this kind.

751
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,200
So cancer didn't know about this.

752
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,200
Plato didn't know about this.

753
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:03,200
The ingarden certainly devoted,

754
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,200
but I'm pretty sure that was under the influence

755
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,200
of his teacher Reina.

756
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,200
And it's amazingly important,

757
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,200
because it applies to the whole realm of the law

758
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,200
and the whole realm of economics,

759
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:20,200
and many other parts of everyday life,

760
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,200
such as the whole realm of the teachers.

761
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,200
But people just didn't notice.

762
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:30,200
Still very few people know how important Reina is.

763
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:36,200
All right, now, it applies also to chess.

764
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,200
Chess and game generally are another area

765
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:42,200
where we find entities of this third kind.

766
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,200
So the chess game was invented, it started to exist,

767
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,200
and it has changed in small ways,

768
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:54,200
but still not in ways which disturb the face of the picture.

769
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,200
So many of these abstract entities,

770
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,200
or historical, cultural entities,

771
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:03,200
these quasi-astract entities of the third kind

772
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,200
have quasi-mathematical properties,

773
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,200
and that's important.

774
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:11,200
These are some examples.

775
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:15,200
Your social security number is not a number.

776
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:18,200
It doesn't have prime factors or anything.

777
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:23,200
It's a social object, and you can't burn it.

778
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:28,200
It can only be created by a certain process,

779
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:34,200
and it can only be eliminated by a certain process.

780
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:43,200
All right, so I have all the wrong views about that.

781
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:48,200
All right, so I believe that Reina's a priori theory of law

782
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,200
is a very good approximation to the underlying ontology

783
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:55,200
of the Austrian School of Economics.

784
01:15:55,200 --> 01:16:00,200
So where Reina was talking about the micro-institutions

785
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:05,200
of human life and indeed the meso-institutions

786
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:08,200
of legal affairs,

787
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:19,200
the Austrian School are talking about the micro-economic realm.

788
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,200
So these are other areas where the Munich approach

789
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:26,200
to doing ontology could, in principle, be applied,

790
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,200
and in some of them, so that colorology and tone theory

791
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,200
have been applied to,

792
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,200
that they've been developed in ways which are similar

793
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,200
to the way the Munich phenomenologists worked,

794
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,200
and all of these have been developed

795
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:43,200
by Munich phenomenologists.

796
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:58,200
Reina points out that while there are some relations

797
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:03,200
and some essences or a priori structures

798
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,200
which are subject to a priori laws,

799
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:10,200
there are others which are purely conventional.

800
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,200
In other words, you add conventions.

801
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,200
So an example would be an endowment mortgage

802
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:21,200
or derivatives created by some formula on the stock market,

803
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,200
or football team managers.

804
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,200
So there are no a priori laws governing football team managers

805
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,200
in the way that they are governing pie.

806
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:33,200
But now what is involved in each of these

807
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,200
is always that they always have a grounding

808
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,200
in a priori social institutions.

809
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:42,200
So the idea of a manager, or the essence manager,

810
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,200
is grounded in the fact that one person has authority

811
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,200
over other persons,

812
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:52,200
and an endowment mortgage is grounded in the fact

813
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:56,200
that one person can loan money to another person.

814
01:17:56,200 --> 01:18:02,200
So what we have here are institutional modifications

815
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:07,200
of a priori institutions or a priori institutional essences.

816
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,200
And another example would be,

817
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,200
let's suppose that it's true in New York State

818
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,200
that a miner cannot sign a contract

819
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:19,200
and be liable for what the contract states

820
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,200
that the miner has to supply.

821
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,200
This would mean that a contract signed by a miner

822
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,200
is not valid.

823
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:32,200
That is not an a priori institutional entity.

824
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,200
It's a modification.

825
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,200
So this modification, if you are less than 13,

826
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,200
you can't sign a contract,

827
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,200
is a product of positive law,

828
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,200
not a product of a priori law.

829
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:46,200
Rynaw was writing about a priori law,

830
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,200
but also about the ways in which a priori law is used

831
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:52,200
as a grounding for positive law,

832
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,200
where lawyers and politicians

833
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:58,200
make more or less arbitrary changes

834
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,200
to what should obtain in an a priori law

835
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:04,200
or a priori of the underlying institution.

836
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:07,200
And you can see how we're going to have similar modifications

837
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,200
in the realm of mathematics.

838
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,200
All right, now let me try and move quickly

839
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,200
to get to my...

840
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,200
I'll put these slides on the...

841
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,200
on the witty page.

842
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:24,200
All right, so the idea is we have a history of mathematics

843
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,200
and a history of physics,

844
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:29,200
and physics is constantly feeding into the history of mathematics

845
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,200
to yield new problems.

846
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,200
Mathematic growth,

847
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,200
there will be some offshoots where mathematicians grow

848
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,200
new kinds of creatures

849
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:43,200
which are not addressing specific needs of physicists

850
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,200
or engineers at a given time,

851
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,200
but they may later prove to be useful.

852
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,200
That's a very common phenomenon

853
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,200
that mathematicians are doing something crazy

854
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,200
that they are doing it for the sake of the beauty

855
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,200
of the entity that they're building,

856
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,200
but it turns out to have an application

857
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,200
in the next generation.

858
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:08,200
And this is something of an illustration of that.

859
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,200
But I found this, and as you know,

860
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:15,200
I like diagrams in the Wikipedia article

861
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,200
on mathematical physics.

862
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,200
And of course I like it because it contains

863
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,200
the word ontology.

864
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:24,200
Now interestingly, the Wikipedia article

865
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,200
doesn't mention the word ontology at all,

866
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:29,200
so I have no idea what they meant.

867
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,200
They just have the diagram,

868
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:35,200
but there are some things which explain what this means.

869
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:38,200
So we have mathematics, mathematical physics,

870
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,200
ontology and physics,

871
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,200
and in some way we get physics

872
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,200
by taking mathematical physics and taking ontology

873
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,200
and smashing them together.

874
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:53,200
And mathematics is somehow feeding into both of those.

875
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:56,200
And I understand how mathematics is feeding

876
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,200
into mathematical physics.

877
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,200
I don't understand what they might mean by this argument,

878
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:03,200
but we've got three hundred fours.

879
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:08,200
Mathematical physics is an approach to physics

880
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:11,200
which emphasises mathematical reading,

881
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,200
that's what they say.

882
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,200
Theoretical physics is an approach to physics

883
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:19,200
that emphasises observations and experiments.

884
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,200
And so we're interested in mathematical physics

885
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,200
which is looking at physics

886
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:31,200
as a structure or an endeavour

887
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:35,200
which is aiming to utilise the rigor

888
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,200
that you find in mathematics.

889
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,200
And I could simplify that by saying

890
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,200
it's going to be using these mathematical structures

891
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,200
which the mathematicians are inventing.

892
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:48,200
So mathematical physics is import use application testing

893
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:51,200
of mathematical structures to physical phenomena,

894
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:54,200
trying to find which mathematical structure fits

895
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,200
a given physical phenomenon.

896
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:00,200
And now we can understand the diagram as follows.

897
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:03,200
So you start historically with a piece of mathematics

898
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:06,200
and this might be a model of mathematics

899
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,200
which is a model of periodic motion

900
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,200
with constant amplitude

901
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,200
which you can define in purely mathematical terms.

902
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,200
And then you add ontology

903
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,200
and I'm going to take that to mean you add reference

904
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:20,200
to a specific system, in this case the harmonic oscillation term.

905
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,200
And specific magnitudes such as force

906
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:29,200
and so forth and amplitude.

907
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:34,200
And when you add ontology to the mathematics

908
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:38,200
where the ontology includes pieces of the physics ontology

909
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,200
then you get physics.

910
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:44,200
So that's just a complicated way of saying that

911
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,200
physics is the application of mathematics

912
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:49,200
to real world phenomena like oscillation.

913
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:55,200
So we finished exactly on time by my law.

914
01:22:55,200 --> 01:23:00,200
Are there any questions?
