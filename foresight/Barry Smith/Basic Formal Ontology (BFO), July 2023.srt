1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
I assume that everyone in the room knows something about BFO.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:13,020
What I'm going to do now is provide a basic introduction to the contents of BFO, a basic

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:20,540
introduction to how it's being used and by whom and why, a basic introduction to what's

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:27,980
happening in Washington DC as we speak almost, to make BFO what we hope will be something

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,780
like the government ontology or rather the top level of the government ontology and by

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,620
that I do not mean that the only government is the one that's in Washington DC.

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:45,860
BFO is used by many groups and when people start building an ontology for a specific

8
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:52,580
purpose they very often examine different top level ontologies.

9
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:02,700
BFO is just one of a small number and some of them then say that they reject using BFO

10
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,940
because it does X and if you check you will find that usually it doesn't do X, in other

11
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,780
words they misunderstood something in BFO and thought they had a reason for not using

12
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,780
it.

13
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:24,020
Now one reason that people give for not using BFO is that BFO is a realist ontology and

14
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,540
I'm going to explain what that means and why some people think that that's a bad thing

15
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,380
and that they're not mistaken and there are reasons why a realist ontology might be a

16
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,380
bad thing.

17
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:42,780
Then I'll go over why people think they need ontologies and specifically top level ontologies.

18
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:51,420
I'll give some examples of successes and failures and I'll try and give a sufficient survey

19
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,540
that you will all go away feeling that you've learned something.

20
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:01,780
Alright so what does it mean that an ontology is a realist ontology?

21
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,460
So I need to start by saying that when we say BFO is a top level ontology what that

22
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,900
means is that it can be applied to any domain whatsoever.

23
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:20,220
Now in creating the ISO standard we had to specify what that might mean, can be applied

24
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,340
to any domain whatsoever.

25
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,860
If we have time today you will see that there are domains which BFO cannot be applied to

26
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:35,580
and I'll give you a clue, it begins with the letter Q and it's part of physics, that we

27
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,700
have three seconds to work out that.

28
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,580
So BFO is not entirely the main neutral, I think now I would say that it's the main neutral

29
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:53,380
for all areas of common sense and all areas of classical physics and all areas where we

30
00:02:53,380 --> 00:03:02,780
collect empirical data and we'll leave Q to one side for the moment.

31
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:15,900
Now secondly we need to mention the requirement that BFO is realist in the sense that BFO requires

32
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,180
that all the classes in BFO have instances.

33
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:30,420
So we have the class object and I am an instance of the class object and I exist in space and

34
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,420
time.

35
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,860
Now I will explain why some people might think that we do not want to insist that all classes

36
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,460
have instances.

37
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:47,340
Now so BFO as all the classes have instances, we're not now talking about classes like protein

38
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,460
or person or planet, we're talking about classes like generically dependent continuum which

39
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,740
we'll come back to later on.

40
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,140
All BFO classes have instances.

41
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:06,900
Now people use BFO as a domain neutral ontology because it provides a good starting point

42
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,420
we think for making domain specific ontologies.

43
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:20,140
So if we take the cell ontology, the cell ontology is all about cells and all cells are objects

44
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,260
in the BFO sense of object.

45
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:30,220
And so all cells in the entire universe and in the entire history of the entire universe

46
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,300
are instances of the BFO class object.

47
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,260
Now a realist ontology is only interested in classes which have instances and when I

48
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:51,780
say have I might mean or have and I'm not going to say anything about the future.

49
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,900
We can worry about that later.

50
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,620
All right now we have evidence that cells exist.

51
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,420
We have evidence that instances of the class cell exist and therefore we have evidence

52
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,380
that instances of the BFO class object exist.

53
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,940
They all exist in space and time and we know this because that's what established science

54
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:20,060
says and we want BFO ontologies to be consistent with established science.

55
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:28,340
Some people I'm not in France now and so I won't mention French philosophers but some

56
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,820
people think that it's actually not a good criterion or something that it should be

57
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,140
conformant to established science.

58
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,900
I did say I wouldn't mention French philosophers so I won't.

59
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:48,540
Now but there are for different reasons BFO conformant domain ontologies which do not

60
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,100
satisfy the principle that all classes have to be instantiated by instances in space and

61
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,620
time.

62
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:02,260
For instance you might be building an ontology for military planning which is all about the

63
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:11,980
future and future things might never exist so some plans are realized that entities

64
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:17,260
inscribed by those plans and by the corresponding plan ontologies then exist but many plans

65
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,380
are not realized and you want a planning ontology to work independently of whether the plans

66
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:30,300
that you use the ontology to describe or represent or define are actually realized.

67
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,780
So planning is a good example where the realist ontology approach in the narrow sense does

68
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,500
not work.

69
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:46,420
Another example and so some people like to build ontologies of fiction or myth.

70
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:55,220
I don't want to talk about those frequently but there are chemists who try to synthesize

71
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:02,900
molecule which never gets synthesized and so a good chemistry ontology probably would

72
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,500
have to include classes which have no instances either in the past or in the present or in

73
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:18,500
the future because there are quite conceivably molecule diagrams which are chemically legal

74
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:25,580
but which are never actually synthesized because they're not synthesizable.

75
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:31,700
But in fact this fact is not a problem for BFO.

76
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:37,740
So BFO encourages people to build BFO conformant domain ontologies which satisfy the instantiation

77
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:45,980
principle but people can build other ontologies and they would still be conformant with BFO.

78
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:53,660
Realism is a kind of metaphysical slogan.

79
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,100
I think it's a very useful slogan when you're building ontologies.

80
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,540
You don't want to build ontologies which are not in the real world but if you have to build

81
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:08,380
ontologies for unsynthesized molecules you can still use BFO and it works perfectly well.

82
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:14,060
And in fact we have now methods which we've developed to help people who are working in

83
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,100
areas where for instance plans are not realized.

84
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:25,940
Just for those people who want to follow up on this, this goes under the heading of the

85
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,860
modal relation ontologies.

86
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:38,420
The modal relation ontology is an extension of BFO which works while working with things

87
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:46,700
like plans and other kinds of application domains where instantiation is not universal.

88
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,660
All right this is BFO, it's quite small.

89
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,940
I'm not going to go through every single piece of it.

90
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:04,020
What we have here is what we call the backbone taxonomy of BFO, in other words it is a hierarchy.

91
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:10,620
Now there are other relations in BFO which are lateral, so these are vertical relations,

92
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,820
they go from the bottom to the top.

93
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,660
So every Fiat surface is a continuous Fiat boundary.

94
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,140
I'll explain some of what that means in a minute.

95
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,540
That is our relation takes you from the bottom of BFO all the way to the very top because

96
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:33,260
everything, every class in BFO is a subclass of the class entity.

97
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:40,260
Now but there are relations such as is part of which does not go from bottom to top, it

98
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,460
goes from one side to the other and there are other lateral relations like that.

99
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:55,460
And an ontology in our view is a backbone taxonomy plus lateral relations.

100
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:02,220
The taxonomy is ISA and then you have maybe many lateral relations, sometimes called object

101
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,900
properties which connect the classes together in different ways.

102
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:16,340
So I'll just give you examples, immaterial entity in BFO is a subclass of independent

103
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:22,860
continuum, a continuum is something which exists through time and independent continuum

104
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:29,180
is something which does not require a bearer in which it inheres.

105
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:36,020
Qualities for instance require bearers, so the redness of your cheek can only exist if

106
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,020
you exist.

107
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:43,020
You are an independent continuum, the redness is a dependent continuum, the redness of your

108
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:53,940
cheek is an instance of the kind of redness which is a subkind of the BFO kind quality.

109
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:04,740
Alright so immaterial entities for BFO include boundaries are not made in matter, spatial

110
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,380
regions are also not made in matter and sites.

111
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:17,060
And for the sake of saving time I would just say that holes with an H are the principal

112
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,380
examples of sites.

113
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:26,980
So the interior of my mouth, the interior of this room are both examples of sites.

114
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:35,540
And now I'll take one more example, realizable entity, a quality is not realizable, if you

115
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,460
have a red cheek you just have a red cheek and that's it.

116
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:46,300
But a potential, a disposition or a function are realizable.

117
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:58,140
So if the function of my iPhone is to send and receive telephone messages, that function

118
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,620
is realized occasionally, but it's not always realized.

119
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,500
And so for some of the time it's just realizable.

120
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:13,940
And I'll be talking more about realisables in the course of the rest of this presentation.

121
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,700
And then I'll say something about fiat object parts.

122
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,620
So my arm is a part of me.

123
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:30,860
But it's not an object, it's a fiat part because the line or the plane between my arm and the

124
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:37,660
rest of me is a matter of our fiat, in other words our decision.

125
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:48,340
So fiat parts are parts which reflect decisions, that's somewhat simplified, but you can illustrate

126
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:59,420
it by saying that everything to the left of this boundary here is the smoking zone, kind

127
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,980
of cockles coming to you.

128
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:09,180
And then on the right of this line is the non-smoking zone, so that's a fiat boundary.

129
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:17,940
Now the boundary between Poland and Germany is also a fiat boundary.

130
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:27,900
All right, so now ontology was used by philosophers, so they tell me, for a long time, starting

131
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:38,180
in about 1652 in Germany as a Latin translation of, or a Latin word to correspond to the Greek

132
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,060
word metaphysics.

133
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:51,540
In around 1970 it started to be used by AI and robotics scientists, primarily in Stanford.

134
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:57,580
And basically they thought that the way to train a robot to behave like a human being

135
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:07,380
would be to describe human common sense using first order logic and then feed the first order

136
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,500
logic description of human common sense into the robot and then the robot would be able

137
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,420
to mimic human behavior.

138
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:21,420
And the behavior that they used as their prime example was buying, sorry, not buying salad.

139
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,220
Yeah, buying salad from a salad bar, this was the era of salad bars.

140
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:33,740
And so the robot would have to know how to pick up tomatoes using plastic implements

141
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,380
without squashing the tomato too much.

142
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,540
And it would have to learn that you can knock into a chair and you don't need to apologize

143
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,900
to the chair, but if you knock into a human being, you do need to apologize.

144
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,740
Those were the things that the robot had to learn.

145
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:59,820
The formal, the first order logic, formal representation of human common sense was called an ontology.

146
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,420
Sometimes it was called a folk ontology.

147
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,460
And the word ontology, they almost certainly took over from Quine.

148
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:14,100
So those of you who know some philosophy who are in the room will know that Quine had a very special

149
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:24,580
approach to ontology, which was, it led to the coinage of this word, folk ontology.

150
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:32,660
And then the next step was the fact that you have different groups building ontologies

151
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,620
and they needed to be able to compare them.

152
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:41,060
And so they invented something called knowledge interchange format.

153
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:50,860
And by a long, long set of stages, the knowledge interchange format eventually became what we now call OWL.

154
00:15:50,860 --> 00:16:00,980
All right, now a famous man in all of this, another Stanford man from this group who is still alive and still selling his thing.

155
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:09,540
It was Doug Lennett who created a big database called Psyche, which is short for encyclopedia.

156
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,820
He now sometimes calls Psyche an ontology.

157
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:27,380
And it's full of folk knowledge, such as Albany is the capital of New York State and other such pieces of knowledge.

158
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:34,900
And as I say, he now calls it an ontology and it's sometimes regarded as being a successful, very large ontology.

159
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,980
It's, BFO is a very small ontology.

160
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,220
We don't try and describe everything.

161
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:47,220
He is basically trying to describe everything, including the virgin birth.

162
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:56,540
There are facts, not the facts, but the virgin birth is an object which is described at some length in the axioms of Psyche.

163
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,620
One big problem with Psyche is that the axioms are not consistent.

164
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:08,060
And Doug Lennett says that's exactly as it should be because common sense is not consistent.

165
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,140
Now, BFO is consistently proved, isn't it?

166
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
All right, come back to that later.

167
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:25,100
So the first really interesting contribution to all of this was by Patrick Hayes in his naive physics manifesto,

168
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:35,380
which described the methodology of robotics that I just hinted at, but he described it in a formal theoretical way.

169
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:44,420
And I believe that it was Patrick Hayes' naive physics manifesto and accompanied by a paper called Ontology of Liquids,

170
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,500
which is the true origin of modern day ontology.

171
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,100
And they're still really interesting pieces.

172
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,340
And then we get knowledge interchange format.

173
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,220
Tom Gruber was an important person in the knowledge interchange format world.

174
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,620
And he, he, it was the begetter of Ciri.

175
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,220
So you all have, Ciri is an ontology app.

176
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,940
So you all have ontologies in your pockets, like it or not.

177
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,540
And this is what an ontology in Ciri might look like.

178
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:24,340
So you have universal for things like real event or movie event.

179
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:33,140
And then you have instances of things like cities where you might see movies or eat meals.

180
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:39,820
And this is, this is what I was talking about when I said that all classes in BFO have instances.

181
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:45,340
The ancient instances are the particulars, the city's particulars, zip codes and so on.

182
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:55,180
The classes are the universals, which are in the top of the diagram here.

183
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:01,380
All right, now the knowledge information format is being made more and more mature.

184
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:10,420
And Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues in 1994 introduced the idea of the semantic web.

185
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:20,540
The idea was that now that we have a somewhat coherent version of owl, the web ontology language,

186
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,860
which is a kind of formalized version of HTML.

187
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,460
It's a long, long gap between HTML and owl.

188
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:36,780
But by 1994, we have something which can serve as the basis for a new kind of web, a semantic web.

189
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:44,300
And it's semantic because it's described using a formal language with a semantics in the classical model, model theoretic sense.

190
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,300
And it would be nice if we had a semantic web, wouldn't it?

191
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,580
Said the people in the paper in Scientific American in 1994.

192
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,100
And I agree, it would be nice, but we don't have anything like it.

193
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,220
We have a lot of things going on under the heading of semantic web.

194
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,340
Too many things going on under the heading of semantic web.

195
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,500
And some of it is good.

196
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,380
And then we have the resource description framework.

197
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,820
Then we have protege.

198
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:19,540
And then we have the first real version of owl in 2004.

199
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,940
And then we have the whoosh of linked open data.

200
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:29,020
And nowadays we have knowledge graphs, some of which is really good.

201
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,020
All right, now, but they all failed.

202
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,100
All of those ontologies are built, including psych, if you look at it.

203
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,500
They all failed.

204
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,460
So most semantic web ontologies fail.

205
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,580
And it's hard to think of ones that succeed.

206
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,180
And there are lots of reasons why they fail.

207
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,260
One reason is it's easy to build the damn things.

208
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,940
And so everybody wants to build one.

209
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,380
And so everybody has their own ontology.

210
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:02,700
And then people say, oh, ontology, no, they're brittle.

211
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:09,060
You use them once, and then you drop them, because they're obviously useless.

212
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,220
And so there are many reasons why they fail.

213
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,460
There were bad languages out there.

214
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,020
I mean, really bad languages.

215
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,260
And they didn't understand what definitions were.

216
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,220
And people today don't understand what definitions are.

217
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,540
And the ontologies were of poor quality.

218
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,100
There was no documentation.

219
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,420
All the links are broken.

220
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,980
Dolce is not bad.

221
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,420
I'm not including Dolce under this heading.

222
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,980
It's bad under other headings, but then so is BFO.

223
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,580
So they're all bad.

224
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,100
And this was ontology winter.

225
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:57,540
And I know that we are now, and thanks to this gentleman here,

226
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,700
we're in ontology high summer.

227
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,540
But there will be another winter.

228
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,580
He won't live forever.

229
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,660
All right, now.

230
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,300
So now I come into the picture.

231
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,420
Is he my throat?

232
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,540
It's got almost better.

233
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,820
In the 1990s, we had the Human Genome Project.

234
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,460
Now, the Human Genome Project was many projects.

235
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,860
And there were many institutions across the planet

236
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:35,740
who were collecting genomic and proteomic and toxicogenomics

237
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,060
and so on data.

238
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,900
And they were creating registries for these data.

239
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,300
And there was panic because every country

240
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,940
had its own collection of registries.

241
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,060
And even within a single country,

242
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,900
the registries would not be collected

243
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,220
and described in a consistent way.

244
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,020
And this was going to correct all the goals

245
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,780
of the Human Genome Project because it

246
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,740
meant that we really didn't have a consistent representation

247
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,540
of all the different human and fly and so on genomes

248
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,140
and all the proteomes and so on.

249
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:24,820
And so a group of four biologists, all of them

250
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:30,420
high up in the genome project world,

251
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,700
one of them was a fly person, one of them

252
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,580
was a mouse person, one of them was a fish person,

253
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,180
and the other was a person person.

254
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,260
And this was in, I believe it was in Montreal.

255
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,900
It was either in Montreal or in Melbourne, I forget.

256
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,740
They're in a pub.

257
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,420
The fly person, Michael Ashburner,

258
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,340
who is my hero in every possible way,

259
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,020
and he's still alive, but he's very sick.

260
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,860
Michael Ashburner was basically the head of the fly genome.

261
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,620
And he wrote down on the back of a cigarette

262
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,700
packet with a heavy smoker, which is relevant still

263
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,220
because he is still alive, but only just.

264
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:23,660
He wrote down a list of gene functions.

265
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,740
For instance, cell division might be on the list.

266
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,780
And he said, this list is going to serve as the basis

267
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:36,700
for creating order in all of these registers.

268
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,060
They're all going to use these words to describe gene

269
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,940
function.

270
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,100
Now there are, I don't know, 13,000 items

271
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,500
on the list of gene functions, or molecular functions

272
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,740
they're called.

273
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,140
And then there are other items on two other lists

274
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:57,580
for biological processes and for cellular constituents.

275
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,900
So that list on the back of that cigarette packet

276
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,100
became the gene ontology.

277
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,260
And the gene ontology has gone from strength to strength

278
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,180
ever since.

279
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,660
Upwards of $3 billion have been spent on the gene ontology,

280
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,460
not on building the ontology, but on using it

281
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,860
to regiment all the data.

282
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,660
All the data in biology, practically speaking,

283
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:28,540
gets touched somehow by the gene ontology.

284
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,660
All right, so this was the first success

285
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,860
in the ontology world.

286
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:38,740
And then because of this success, and because of,

287
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,580
well, no, Propagate actually was not causing problems

288
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,340
at this stage.

289
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,460
They had their own language for building ontologies,

290
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,780
which was a simple database language.

291
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,460
And I've forgotten what it's called.

292
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,940
Can anyone remind me?

293
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,460
Anyway, they have their own language.

294
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,580
They use OWL now.

295
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,740
So they were building ontologies.

296
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,180
So we have the gene ontology.

297
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,860
It's really good.

298
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,460
Now we need an anatomy ontology.

299
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,300
We need a fly anatomy ontology.

300
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,180
And we need a protein ontology.

301
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,780
We need a gene sequence ontology.

302
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,700
And they were right.

303
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,300
We didn't need all of those things.

304
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,940
So they started to build them.

305
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,860
But now they started to slip back into the old,

306
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,900
oh, I downloaded Propagate.

307
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,460
Now I can build an ontology, and then they built crap.

308
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:31,700
In 2002, I received a prize from the German government,

309
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:39,580
a lot of money, to found an institute for medical ontology.

310
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,180
I did not know anything about medicine.

311
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,540
I did not know anything about biology.

312
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,900
Somebody approached me very early on in my institute.

313
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,220
I had an institute in Leipzig.

314
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:59,180
And they said, what do you think is the gene ontology?

315
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,420
And I had never heard of the gene ontology.

316
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,380
And I looked at it.

317
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,100
And within 15 seconds, I realized three things.

318
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,140
Not all of which turned out to be true.

319
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,300
First thing was, within five seconds,

320
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,540
I realized that I would spend the rest of my life working

321
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,060
on the gene ontology.

322
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,460
But that isn't true, this is.

323
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,860
But that came into my head immediately.

324
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,660
The second thing which came into my head

325
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,020
was the gene ontology is exactly what we need.

326
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,780
This is what my new institute should be based on.

327
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,140
And that came true.

328
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:44,820
And then the third thing that I realized is that it's crap.

329
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:51,340
And it's crap because it's full of logical mistakes.

330
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,140
And I could talk for two hours just

331
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,140
listing the logical mistakes that they were making.

332
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,060
And so I had money.

333
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:04,300
I invited the leadership of the gene ontology to Leipzig.

334
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,500
They already knew about me.

335
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,860
I think I published a short paper on problems

336
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,260
with the gene ontology.

337
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,140
And they wanted to come and see what I was doing.

338
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,860
So they came and we had a workshop,

339
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,340
which was historically interesting for reasons

340
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,260
having to do with 2001.

341
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:32,700
And I presented a talk at this meeting.

342
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,860
So the gene ontology is called the GO, G-O.

343
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:42,140
And so my talk was called STOP, which

344
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,900
is short for smart terminology through ontological principles.

345
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,740
And I just went through all the mistakes

346
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,700
in the logic of the gene ontology.

347
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,700
And after this talk, Michael Ashburner

348
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,100
went, took me behind the curtain.

349
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,820
And he said, Barry, I will do a deal with you.

350
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:11,260
I will put you in charge of the logic of the gene ontology.

351
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,300
And in return, you will promise never

352
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:18,580
to criticize the gene ontology in public.

353
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,180
And I did the deal.

354
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,540
I sold my soul.

355
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,140
And you have just decided to follow up.

356
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,460
Oh, well, now that was moved to a new millennium question.

357
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,740
Now, I'm only criticizing as it was then.

358
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,660
So I think that the gene ontology community will admit

359
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,460
that I did clean up the gene ontology

360
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,460
from a logical point of view and that that was useful.

361
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,180
But in cleaning up the gene ontology,

362
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,300
I ended up cleaning up also some of the other ontologies

363
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,460
to make them fit the gene ontology in a proper logical way.

364
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:03,340
And that is the oboe foundry, the open biological and biomedical

365
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,500
ontology's foundry.

366
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,700
It's a collection of ontologies which

367
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,940
have been cleaned up logically so that they fit together.

368
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:15,940
And Michael wanted to call it the oboe smithing.

369
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,700
But I put my foot down on that.

370
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,420
And so we came to the idea of calling it the oboe foundry.

371
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:27,740
The idea is that to build these foundries is really hard work.

372
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,460
And it's hard work in the sense that you

373
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,420
have to ban things and people with hammers and things.

374
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,780
All right, so how do we do it?

375
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,260
How do we link them all together?

376
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,740
The answer is BFO.

377
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,860
So this is the original picture of the foundry.

378
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,900
The gene ontology is the yellow part.

379
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,860
And at the very top, we have the core of BFO.

380
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,260
We have independent continuance such as molecules and cells

381
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,860
and organism, dependent continuance such as qualities

382
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,780
and function, and occurrence, processes, which

383
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,820
corresponds exactly to the three parts of the gene ontology

384
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,980
biological processes, molecular functions,

385
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,460
and cellular development.

386
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,980
BFO is a reverse engineering of the genome's policy

387
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,500
to apply to everything, apart from things

388
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:27,140
beginning with Q. And so BFO grew in the course of creating

389
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,740
the oboe foundry.

390
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,620
And there are now, it's gone up.

391
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:35,300
It's probably about 490 ontologies

392
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,780
which are using BFO.

393
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:40,060
And you can find there's a list of users of BFO, which

394
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,900
we update periodically.

395
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,380
And not all of these ontologies are any good.

396
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,820
I wouldn't say that most of them are not very good,

397
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,220
but some of them are very good.

398
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,420
And the fact they use BFO helps, even

399
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,740
if they don't always use it correctly,

400
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,980
because at least they're trying to do something which

401
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,020
would be interoperable with other ontologies using BFO.

402
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,740
And they're also drawing on the talent

403
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,580
of people who have experienced building ontologies using BFO.

404
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,860
Now, in the beginning, which is to say, until about four

405
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,060
or five years ago, that all of these ontologies

406
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,700
practically speaking were biology or biomedicine

407
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,740
or something like that.

408
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:36,740
So now we have more foundries.

409
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,660
And not all of them have anything to do with biology.

410
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,340
And I'm going to be talking about the foundry

411
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,460
at the bottom, the diode foundry,

412
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,740
towards the end of this presentation.

413
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:54,340
So now we have more ontologies built using the BFO principles

414
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,180
and following the idea that you have to build ontologies

415
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,780
so that they work logically together in at least all

416
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,460
of these areas.

417
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,940
In fact, there are some more, which I will also talk about.

418
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,580
Now, one of them is called the common core ontologies, which

419
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,900
you can think of as a set of mid-level ontologies

420
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,580
for things like artifacts, events, relations, units

421
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,380
of measure.

422
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,180
And then we have many, many domain ontologies, many of which

423
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,380
have been funded by one or other military project, which

424
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,260
have been defined within the framework of the common core

425
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:36,980
mid-level ontology for various sorts of military applications

426
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,500
and intelligence community applications.

427
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,540
And now my view of what BFO is doing in all of this

428
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:51,340
gets more, I hope, more sophisticated as time goes by.

429
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:56,380
Now I like to compare BFO to the QWERTY keyboard.

430
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,900
It's a standard.

431
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,740
Lots of people like to use this standard.

432
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,180
They become skilled at using this standard.

433
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,100
And so you can't change it very easily

434
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,940
because you get very bad reactions from existing users.

435
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,620
It's not necessarily the best ontology or the best top-level

436
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,700
ontology, but it's certainly the most often used

437
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,940
top-level ontology.

438
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:27,900
And I think that it's a good idea to think of ontology

439
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:33,380
as being, in part, not an attempt to describe what is,

440
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:39,740
but an attempt to legislate about how we will describe what is.

441
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,380
And I'm not sure whether that's helpful,

442
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,860
just stated in this form.

443
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,020
But I know from my own experience

444
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,180
that very often when I'm arguing with people

445
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:53,180
in the course of building ontologies collectively,

446
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,700
that I repeatedly reach the point where I say,

447
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,460
here we just legislate.

448
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,980
It's like driving on the left.

449
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,180
It's obviously, it's not obviously the right side

450
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,780
of the road to drive, but you need to make a choice.

451
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,380
And that choice is a matter of legislation

452
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,140
and that kind of choice is very often necessary

453
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,220
when building ontology.

454
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,980
All right, so the ISO standard will exist pretty soon

455
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,980
in four parts, part one and part two already exist.

456
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,540
As you can see down there, you spend 118 francs.

457
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,620
You can get a PDF copy.

458
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,060
That's about 18 pages long.

459
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:40,380
But if you click on the link in the blue box here,

460
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,980
you can get it for free.

461
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:47,100
And that's because ISO gives away ISO standards free

462
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,900
if they are used to create other standards.

463
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,220
And this particular ISO standard, both part one and two,

464
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,980
and I assume this will apply to parts three and four,

465
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,220
also are used to build other standards.

466
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,580
That's what they're there for, and so they're free.

467
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,220
So this describes the requirements

468
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,220
for being a top-level ontology.

469
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:16,580
Part two describes BFO and shows that BFO

470
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,620
also meets those requirements.

471
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,700
And this part two, you can also get free

472
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,820
by pressing on the blue button.

473
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:31,220
And now this is a part of a list of ontologies today,

474
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,780
which is to say within the two years

475
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,420
of the appearance of the ISO standard,

476
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,660
which are outside biology and medicine.

477
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,740
So in other words, where BFO was initially used

478
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,180
primarily in the medical and biological sphere,

479
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,500
it's now used in many other spheres.

480
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,620
Not all of these are post-ISO,

481
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:56,940
but many of them are, and the more important ones are,

482
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,140
because people in different domains,

483
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,020
not just in biology and medicine,

484
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,900
but also in other domains, and I, military,

485
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,740
I keep repeating, they need ontology too,

486
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,940
and they have discovered that if you need ontology,

487
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,940
then you need ontologies, which are organized

488
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,260
in some kind of suite, and then you need a top-level

489
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,500
in order to give logical coherence to the suite.

490
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,740
All right, so let's, I was going to have a slide,

491
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,100
which would be my only French slide,

492
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:32,100
which said question, but I forgot, so any question?

493
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,100
I have a very ontological question.

494
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,620
Your example about the arm being a truantist part.

495
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,980
And your arm is kind of independent continuance,

496
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,060
even being attached to the body,

497
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,700
because it has a concept, this flow of personality.

498
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,300
Yes, the issue is exclusively the nature of the boundary.

499
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,700
If you tear off the arm, you have an object.

500
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,340
It's independent, so the criteria is the connection.

501
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,420
I have some for the discussion.

502
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,260
All right, we can go back to that.

503
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,540
Think of the no-smoking zone.

504
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,420
No, that's a boys' case, the boys' one.

505
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,260
Well, it's the same.

506
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,500
The left side of the room.

507
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,980
An arm belonging, and a not arm belonging zone,

508
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,020
and the arm belonging zone is up here.

509
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,620
And the line between them is here.

510
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,900
All right, so now let's go back to the BFO.

511
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,460
At the very top, we have continuance and occurrence.

512
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:42,300
So continuance exists through time, occurrence occur in time,

513
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,740
and the test is whether something has temporal parts.

514
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,460
Your life has temporal parts.

515
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,140
Your youth is a temporal part of your life.

516
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,940
It's not a part of you, it's a part of your life.

517
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,900
You do not have any temporal parts.

518
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,020
You have physical parts, or three-dimensional parts,

519
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,060
or spatial parts, your arm, for instance.

520
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,060
But your youth is not a part of you,

521
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,060
it's a part of your life.

522
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,780
So the life is an occurrence.

523
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,180
You are a continuance.

524
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:17,220
And we now distinguish between independent continuance

525
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,500
and dependent continuance.

526
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,100
Now, thing, object, and so on are words

527
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,140
which can be used to describe independent continuance,

528
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,260
and people use words like attribute or property

529
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,700
and so forth to describe dependent continuance.

530
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,020
We will talk about the different kinds

531
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,500
of dependent continuance in a minute.

532
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,740
And then occurrence are things like processes,

533
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,100
events, happenings, things we go on,

534
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,060
sometimes processes in which nothing goes on.

535
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,060
So the process of these lights being switched on

536
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,740
is an occurrence in BFO terms,

537
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,140
because it has temporal parts,

538
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,540
namely the morning lights being switched on

539
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,660
and the afternoon lights being switched on.

540
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,700
This is called a state or a stasis

541
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,580
in some people's dialect.

542
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,740
And now, qualities and roles are the two big groups

543
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,340
of attributes, and the qualities would be something

544
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,860
like your temperature, your height, your weight.

545
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:30,540
And every quality, every attribute demands a bearer.

546
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,860
So there is no height or weight or temperature

547
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,260
unless it is the height or weight

548
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,380
or temperature of some object.

549
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,660
So the dependent continuance depends on some bearer.

550
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,460
And then we have occurrence,

551
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,700
and the occurrence also depends.

552
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,780
Every event depends on some participant.

553
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,380
There are no events, no processes, no incidents,

554
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,620
no happenings which take place

555
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:04,020
unless there is some independent continuance

556
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,020
in which or between which they happen.

557
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,780
And all of these are axioms in the BFO axiom set.

558
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,220
And now we have instances which do not belong to BFO.

559
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,820
BFO is above the line, and then all the instances,

560
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,620
all the cells, all the molecules,

561
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,420
all the planets, all the galaxies,

562
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,900
are instances of the BFO kind object.

563
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,900
And so above the line we have what we sometimes call classes,

564
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:39,300
I think I use the word kind already, types, universals,

565
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,100
that really those words all mean the same thing.

566
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,340
They are what is general,

567
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,220
and then the instances are what is particular.

568
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,220
And qualities have instances.

569
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:53,020
Your weight is an instance of the kind weight,

570
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,420
and my weight is an instance of the kind weight.

571
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:01,820
And now databases typically are about instances

572
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,180
where ontologies again, typically are about types

573
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,220
or classes or categories or universals or generals.

574
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:13,740
And then we use the ontologies to tag the instance data.

575
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,860
So this is a very, very crude dichotomy.

576
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,300
We put the two together, we get knowledge back.

577
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,660
And now Ryan Ricucci again, I should change this slide.

578
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,220
Is an instance of the kind human being.

579
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:34,220
So that is actually him, it's not a photo of him.

580
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,420
Actually you can see it.

581
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,140
He is an instance of the kind human being,

582
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,820
which is a subkind of the kind object,

583
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,780
which is a subkind of the kind independent continuum.

584
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,620
And then there are lots of occurrences

585
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,940
which are instances of process.

586
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:56,620
And now we have more complicated examples,

587
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,780
the Hoover Dam and the resilience of the Hoover Dam.

588
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,180
Those are instances.

589
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,500
And the decline in resilience of the Hoover Dam over time

590
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,740
is an instance of the kind process.

591
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,660
So now we have a process, which is a change

592
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,020
in an attribute of an object,

593
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:18,660
rather than a process, which is an example

594
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:22,660
of an instantiation of change in an object.

595
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,940
Change in attributes means it gets less and less resilient.

596
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,740
Change in object means that it loses stones,

597
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,940
gradually becomes smaller.

598
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,060
So on the left we have what is

599
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,180
and on the right we have what happens.

600
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,500
And Ryan's here again.

601
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:44,300
So Ryan's temperature is an instance of the kind temperature,

602
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:49,140
which is a subclass or subkind of the kind quality.

603
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,660
And Ryan's life is an instance of the kind life.

604
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,220
And we can put all of those together with information.

605
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:02,700
So information entities are about all of these other things

606
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,940
and they come in different varieties

607
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,020
such as name, address, telephone number,

608
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,340
and they have instances too,

609
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,180
namely Ryan's name, Ryan's telephone number.

610
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:16,900
And there are seven Ryan Rikuchi's known to man,

611
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,300
I'm assuming there are at least seven,

612
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:24,300
but there's only one name of this Ryan Rikuchi.

613
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,460
It looks exactly the same as the other six names

614
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,020
of the other Ryan Rikuchi's,

615
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,580
but there are in fact seven names

616
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:36,140
of the seven Ryan Rikuchi and so on.

617
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,340
And that's a picture of Ryan, it's not him.

618
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,740
That's a picture of him.

619
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,380
All right, and then we've done this.

620
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,820
Oh yeah, realisables.

621
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,460
I mentioned realisable earlier

622
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,220
and I'll say something about them again.

623
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,420
So dispositions are the most interesting example

624
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,260
of realisable.

625
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,060
So dispositions are potentials, tendencies.

626
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,580
I have a disposition to lose hair.

627
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:05,300
Bananas have a disposition to get ripe and so on.

628
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,780
So they're tendencies, potentials.

629
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,740
We don't really know much about dispositions.

630
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,140
There are many of them.

631
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,020
There's lots of junk dispositions everywhere.

632
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,180
We don't have names for many of them.

633
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:21,180
Science is about them, diseases are dispositions.

634
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,760
Which snow med doesn't quite get.

635
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,180
But now some dispositions are really special

636
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,580
and that there are fewer of these.

637
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,820
And these are the dispositions which crudely speaking,

638
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:40,820
we want to have, we want there to be dispositions like this

639
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,900
and we call them capabilities.

640
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,740
So your car can play music.

641
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,940
I'm assuming you have a stereo in your car.

642
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,100
But that's not the function of your car.

643
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,220
It's just a capability and so on.

644
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,820
So people do the washing up

645
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,660
but that's not the function of people.

646
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,140
And you can use a screwdriver as a weapon

647
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,940
but that's not the function of a screwdriver.

648
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,940
So capabilities are dispositions which are like functions.

649
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,260
It's good to have them but they're not functions.

650
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:17,140
They are side effects, if you like.

651
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,340
And we're still trying to work out

652
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,860
a good definition of capability.

653
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:24,260
We don't, capability is not yet a term in BFO.

654
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,580
Disposition is in BFO and function is in BFO.

655
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,100
Capability, it might take 10 years

656
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,260
before we are really happy with the constitution.

657
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:38,260
And so that means that BFO develops slowly.

658
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,060
People who know a lot about BFO have been trained

659
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:48,460
to be really evil when it comes to finding arguments

660
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,700
against decisions.

661
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,820
And so that means decisions are made very slowly

662
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:55,340
and carefully, we'd like to think.

663
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,380
All right, now functions are a bit easier.

664
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,920
A function is the reason for the existence of its bearer.

665
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,600
So the function of a screwdriver is to screw screws.

666
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,760
That's why we have screwdriver.

667
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,760
The function of cars is to transport passengers.

668
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,640
Function of eyes is to see.

669
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,360
Function of your digestive system is to digest.

670
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,800
Functions are easy.

671
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,280
Capabilities are like functions but they're difficult.

672
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,840
And one definition of biological capability

673
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,840
is that they are dispositions

674
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,160
which contribute to the realization

675
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,680
of biological functions.

676
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,520
So you can go away and think about that.

677
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,720
All right, so we get the same kind of picture.

678
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,920
So we realize the function of John's eye

679
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,840
in John's seeing, which is a process.

680
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,200
And now only certain kinds of entities have functions.

681
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,400
And I don't know of any kinds of entities

682
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,560
other than the ones on this list.

683
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:01,160
So perhaps worker beings have functions.

684
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,640
And queen bees and worker ants and so-called carpenter ants.

685
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,360
I don't know, but organisms in general do not have function.

686
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,960
It is not my function to do on top of it.

687
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,640
I'm sure about that, even though it sometimes seems

688
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,320
not to be the case for me.

689
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,560
All right, now maybe companies, organizations have functions

690
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,080
but they're a bit like colonial organisms in this way, maybe.

691
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,520
So there are many more capabilities

692
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,680
than there are functions.

693
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,920
And this is how it might look.

694
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,120
The future BFO might look like this.

695
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,600
So we have dispositions of the broad class,

696
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,200
capabilities are a subclass

697
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,880
and then functions are a subclass of that subclass.

698
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,680
But now there are two kinds of realizable entities.

699
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:59,560
In addition to dispositions, we also have roles.

700
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,000
Now dispositions are defined

701
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,480
on the basis of the physics of the bearer.

702
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,720
So the reason why I have a disposition to go of all

703
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,920
is because of the physics of my head's metabolism, I don't know.

704
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,120
I don't know why I have that.

705
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:22,120
Roles are defined externally by decisions,

706
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,120
by demarcations, by stymings of contracts and so forth.

707
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:36,120
And so roles are the products of social organization, basically.

708
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,120
Being employed is a role, being fired is a role.

709
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,920
You can be employed because your contract

710
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,320
that you signed four days ago comes into effect

711
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,720
at midnight in a week.

712
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,720
You do not change physically at all at midnight in a week,

713
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,920
at all in a way which is relevant to being an employee,

714
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,120
but you have the role at that point in time

715
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,120
because that's what the contract is.

716
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,320
So roles are not a matter of physics,

717
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,320
they're a matter of a certain entity being

718
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,720
in certain social institutional circumstances

719
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,520
and in virtue of being in that set of circumstances

720
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,320
such as being the object described in an employment contract

721
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,320
you acquire or lose a certain role.

722
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,320
And this just repeats what I just said.

723
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,520
Now interestingly, there are roles which form systems.

724
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:37,520
These are examples of two-sided mutual dependence among roles,

725
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:43,520
which are rather simple ones and then there are more complicated ones.

726
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,520
Now, BFO has been used in many areas.

727
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:53,520
One area where we still do not have anything like usable ontology content

728
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,520
is the law.

729
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,520
We're working a little bit on economics,

730
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,520
but we don't have a good ontology of law.

731
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:05,520
This may be one way of starting the ontology of law in terms of role.

732
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,520
And there is an ontology called de-act, document act ontology,

733
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,520
which is following something like this line.

734
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:19,520
That may be where we start, but it's not established itself

735
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,520
in the way that it should establish itself as the ontology of law,

736
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,520
which is what we want.

737
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:33,520
And this is the authority ontology, or an authority ontology,

738
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,520
which again might serve as a starting point.

739
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,520
All right, so this is another picture of BFO.

740
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,520
I left out all the space and time and location.

741
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,520
I just have the things that we've talked about so far,

742
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,520
like qualities, roles and so forth.

743
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:53,520
And this gives us another opportunity to have question.

744
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,520
What are your thoughts on the genesis?

745
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,520
Yes, so Ryan Rikuchi's name is not just a string of letters.

746
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:25,520
It's in so many ways, it's not just a string of letters.

747
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,520
It came into existence at a certain time in history for instance.

748
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,520
And the string of letters existed prior to that.

749
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,520
There are almost certainly older Ryan Rikuchi somewhere out there.

750
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,520
I'm not sure about the Ryan part.

751
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,520
There is certainly other Rikuchi.

752
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,520
But I'll give you a puzzle.

753
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:52,520
John's credit card number is token for token identical

754
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,520
with Frank's social security number.

755
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,520
They're not the same number, they're not the same entity.

756
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:04,520
But regardless of strings, they are by definition the same string.

757
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,520
So this is the social objects get complicated very quickly.

758
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,520
Yes.

759
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,520
Yes.

760
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,520
So every child has at least two parents, I guess.

761
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,520
That would be a first guess.

762
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,520
But it doesn't go in the opposite direction.

763
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,520
Not every adult male human has a child.

764
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,520
Not every adult female human has a child.

765
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,520
Not every pair of adult males and females have a child.

766
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,520
So here you have one-sided dependence.

767
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,520
The example I gave on the screen were two-sided dependence.

768
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,520
Oh no, yes, you're right.

769
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,520
Not all of these dependence relations are going to be roles.

770
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:09,520
Now, when you adopt though, if you adopt a child, that would be a role.

771
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,520
Yes.

772
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,520
So having a child is biology, which is physics in the end.

773
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:23,520
Adoption is partly biology and partly physics, but the core of it is a role kind of phenomenon.

774
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,520
And there might be other similar role phenomena having to do with parents and children.

775
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:34,520
So, well, I don't want to think too hard about it.

776
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,520
Kidnapping.

777
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,520
All right, any more?

778
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,520
So we've seen this picture already, but now we have green at the top.

779
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:51,520
And I just mentioned that we have a granularity axis.

780
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,520
So molecules of small cells and cellular components are larger than organs and organisms are larger.

781
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,520
And then we have populations which are not on this chart.

782
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:05,520
But we've been adding to the elbow foundry over the years.

783
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,520
This is still the 2005 version.

784
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,520
Even then, this is something of an idealization even then.

785
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:18,520
First of all, we added the environment ontology, which covers all granularities because there are molecular environments.

786
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,520
There are cellular environments or environments of organisms.

787
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,520
Organisms, there are environments, all populations, tribe and so forth.

788
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:34,520
And then there is the ontology for biomedical investigations.

789
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:41,520
OB, which is one of the best of all the oboe foundry ontology when it comes to the quality of the engineering of the ontology.

790
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,520
And this is about experimental processes.

791
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,520
So it goes on the occurrence side.

792
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:59,520
So what happened was that the biologists in the world of the genome project knew that they needed ontologies of biological entities, processes, cells and so forth.

793
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:05,520
But then they discovered at a certain point in time, and I was at the meetings where this discovery was made.

794
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,520
It wasn't my idea.

795
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:13,520
They discovered that they needed ontologies to describe the experiments.

796
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:35,520
And they needed ontologies to describe the ontologies to describe the data coming from those experiments because how you interpret a biological argument or a biological hypothesis or a biological conclusion in a biological paper depends on the methods which were used to reach that conclusion.

797
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,520
And so you needed to have an ontology of experimental methods.

798
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,520
And that's what OB is.

799
00:56:41,520 --> 00:57:04,520
It's an ontology, not just the methods, but also equipment, hypotheses, parameters, inputs, outputs, data, data processing, material processing processes.

800
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:09,520
Sometimes in biology, you do experiments by looking at data and processing.

801
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,520
And you have an output.

802
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,520
You have input is data, output is data.

803
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:20,520
Sometimes you do experiments by taking material as input, and then you have data as output data about that material.

804
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:27,520
Then they realized that they needed an ontology of the evidence that would be generated by an experiment.

805
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:45,520
So there is something called the evidence ontology, which distinguishes, for instance, between conclusions which were drawn by direct observation, conclusions drawn from computational computation.

806
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:52,520
And then I think one of them is something like inference drawn from paper.

807
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:59,520
So that it's not a very, not all of the codes in the evidence code ontology describe strong evidence.

808
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:08,520
The idea is that if you have multiple kinds of evidence for a given biological conclusion, then you should be able to document that in something like an ontology.

809
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:13,520
All right, so then we, so we have the ontology for biomedical investigation.

810
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:37,520
And we realized, and here I was involved directly in the decision making, we realized that we needed terms for things like footnotes, or sentences, or vowels, or instructions, or papers, or grants, or grant submission documents and so forth.

811
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:45,520
And so they were happily using protege to add all of these terms into OB.

812
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:53,520
But then I said footnotes are not biological. They don't belong in a biology ontology.

813
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:01,520
So it's not only biological investigations with biomedical investigations which use footnotes or vowels.

814
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:08,520
And so we, we started building an information artifact ontology.

815
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:18,520
And here too, I'm not sure this is a good thing, but here too I played a role as this decision. I named the ontology for biomedical investigations incidentally.

816
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:32,520
Originally it was a joke name for FUMO or something, functional genomics, something, FUGO, something.

817
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:41,520
And I said, no, it's not only about functional genomics. It's about all biomedical investigations. And so we should call it the ontology for biomedical investigations.

818
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:46,520
In fact, we should have called it the ontology for investigation because it can be applied to physics.

819
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:54,520
Maybe we should have called it the ontology for data and material processing activities because it can be applied to manufacturing.

820
00:59:54,520 --> 01:00:03,520
And in fact, here you have inputs which are material and outputs which are material and that that kind of input output chain falls under OB2.

821
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,520
But anyway, we can't have everything.

822
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:24,520
But we could have, now what would we call it, the information what ontology, if we call it the information ontology, we commit what I argue for legislative purposes, not because it's true.

823
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,520
Although it is true.

824
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:31,520
I argue that you should never use mass nouns when building an ontology.

825
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:48,520
So if you think of sugar, sugar can mean the chemical substance, which is a kind of abstract universal, or it can mean two lumps of sugar, or it can mean all the sugar on the planet, or it can mean all the sugar ever in the history of the universe.

826
01:00:48,520 --> 01:01:00,520
And it's completely ambiguous what sugar means. But if you say lump of sugar, which is not a mass noun, it's a count noun, then you have something with the meaning of which you know.

827
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:11,520
And if you look at snowmen, not today, but in the early days of snowmen, you find that they made mistakes because they used mass noun by blood.

828
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:20,520
And they didn't because they were using a mass now they made certain characteristic errors which people make when they use mass now. So I say never use mass now.

829
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,520
Information is a mass now.

830
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:28,520
And indeed, if you use the mass now information you make mistakes.

831
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:38,520
So people who say that the genome is information are making a mistake.

832
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:54,520
A sequence, which is created by a sequencer and a computer and printed out or printed on a screen or just stored in a database. That is a piece of information.

833
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:07,520
The other structures which that piece of information in somebody's hard drive picture or represent is not information it's biology molecules in patterns.

834
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:19,520
So many people, maybe fewer now than then but in that era, the idea that genomics was a branch of computer science or information science was very popular.

835
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:38,520
We wanted to work against that. And so we kind I coined the term for the ontology information artifact ontology so that we made it clear that we're dealing with artifacts, which is to say things made by human beings, streams, databases,

836
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:46,520
footnotes, grant submissions, addresses names, telephone numbers and so on. These are all information.

837
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:52,520
And that's what the information artifact ontology is all about.

838
01:02:53,520 --> 01:03:09,520
I mean the information artifact ontology terms are representing instances, which are about instances of disease processes and all of the other things that biologists care about.

839
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:24,520
And that's the key term in the information artifact ontology and information artifact ontology is roughly speaking a copyable entity, which is about something.

840
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:34,520
We have modular suites of ontologies, like the over foundry. What do they bring us? Well, first of all, we have a division of labor.

841
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:44,520
I will do proteins and you will do RNA. And we won't that we will thereby have a clear boundary between what you do and what I do.

842
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:51,520
This also means that anyone who needs a protein ontology knows where to find it because it's called the protein ontology.

843
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,520
That's another rule that people often break.

844
01:03:54,520 --> 01:04:06,520
So instead of calling their ontology the spider affordance ontology or, well, let's say the spider activity ontology in honor of the building that we're in.

845
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:13,520
Instead of calling the spider activity ontology, they call it the Santa Barbara something.

846
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:21,520
And nobody knows what it is. And so nobody uses it outside Santa Barbara.

847
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:34,520
All right, then it because people are working on modular suites of ontologies, they're using BFO over and over again, they become experts at using BFO over and over again.

848
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:50,520
Because somebody is in charge of the protein ontology and is known to be in charge of the protein ontology that somebody has a special reason to be devoting a great deal of scientific expertise and effort to make sure that protein ontology is done properly.

849
01:04:51,520 --> 01:05:08,520
Also, users will be motivated to use the ontology and to find errors in and report those errors because if they're using the ontology they want the ontology to be good.

850
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:15,520
If it's if it's going to be good and you find an error you have to tell the ontology editors about the error.

851
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:26,520
That makes it better, which means gives you an even better motive for using it yourself in a kind of virtuous circle.

852
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:32,520
And I won't go through this. So there have been four versions of BFO.

853
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:38,520
Version number one was released in 2001.

854
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:45,520
And it nothing changed for six years but then we added the information artifact ontology.

855
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:54,520
And once we did that we realized that we needed a term in BFO, which would be the parent of information artifact.

856
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,520
And we didn't have one.

857
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,520
And so we created one and I'll talk about that in a minute.

858
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:12,520
In 2015, I'll to came out and so we did an overhaul of BFO 1.1 to make it conform with BFO 2.

859
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:28,520
And then in 20 in 2020, we released BFO 2020, which was released to take account of the fact that in the ISO standard data that so there is data associated with the ISO standard.

860
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:39,520
About the first order logic formalization of BFO and also about the consistency proof, which is part of the accompanying data to the ISO standard.

861
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:46,520
And so that is the core for the changes which we made in 2020 BFO itself.

862
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:49,520
The picture that you saw has changed hardly at all.

863
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,520
The definitions are a bit tidier.

864
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:57,520
The most important changes that we now have a first order logic formalization.

865
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,520
Alright, so that's the picture again.

866
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:06,520
And now I'm going to talk about how we dealt with information artifacts.

867
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:11,520
And so we've already seen this.

868
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,520
There are two kinds of specifically dependent continuance.

869
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:27,520
There are qualities, which include patterns, pattern of a chessboard, for instance, would be a pattern and a pattern in the BFO sense, which is a continuum.

870
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:32,520
And then there are realisables like functions and roles.

871
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:37,520
And now notice that we say that these are specifically dependent continuance.

872
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:43,520
In the Middle Ages, the philosophers who dealt with these questions had various axioms.

873
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:48,520
One axiom was accidents do not migrate.

874
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,520
So they had substances and they had accidents.

875
01:07:51,520 --> 01:08:02,520
And one famous Italian metaphysician concluded, this was in the time of the plague, concluded from this axiom that the plague does not exist.

876
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,520
Because accidents do not migrate.

877
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,520
They couldn't see the bacteria or the virus.

878
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,520
I don't know if you are.

879
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,520
And so they didn't know that they were there.

880
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:16,520
They just saw the accidents, presumably the symptoms and so forth in the people.

881
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:20,520
Since accidents don't migrate, there can be no play.

882
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:33,520
This argument was seriously put forward and it's the motto for an Italian novel of some repute called You Promise Those Both Me.

883
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:38,520
Anyway, I recommend the novel and the motto is about why the plague does not exist.

884
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:46,520
Now the plague does exist because viruses can move around and bacteria can move around.

885
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,520
But specifically dependent continuance cannot migrate.

886
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,520
I cannot have your headed.

887
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,520
I cannot have your height.

888
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,520
I cannot have your name.

889
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:02,520
I cannot have your capabilities.

890
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:11,520
Even if my capabilities are qualitatively identical to your capability, my capabilities are mine and your capabilities are yours.

891
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,520
They are specifically dependent on their bear.

892
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:23,520
But there are some dependent continuance which can migrate and they are generically dependent on their bearers.

893
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,520
And an example would be, well, the PDF file on my laptop.

894
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,520
I have a certain PDF file.

895
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:36,520
I send it to Ryan and now the very same PDF file is in two places.

896
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,520
It's copyable.

897
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:47,520
And if I now destroy the PDF file on my laptop, the PDF file still exists because it's on his laptop.

898
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,520
And that's what we mean by generically dependent continuance.

899
01:09:50,520 --> 01:10:01,520
We mean continuance which are dependent upon some independent, continuant bearer such as a hard drive, but which are not specifically dependent on any bearer.

900
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,520
All you need is one, but it could move around.

901
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,520
Typically there will be many copies.

902
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:13,520
So a novel is a specifically dependent, is a generically dependent continuance because the novel exists in many copies.

903
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:21,520
Emails that you send are generically dependent continuance because they exist both on the sender and on the receiver side.

904
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,520
And DNA sequences are generically dependent continuance.

905
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:44,520
Two, both in both senses, both the sense of the sequence in the sequence database and the sense of sequence as meaning a molecular pattern, which is copied as we all know trillions of times in every human being.

906
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:48,520
Alright, so that's where we get information artifacts into BFO.

907
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:59,520
They're all children of the new kind, new type, new universal that we introduced in BFO 2.0, namely generically dependent continuum.

908
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:11,520
Now we did not introduce the new kind information artifact because generically dependent continuance are entities which are domain neutral.

909
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:26,520
You can in principle find generically dependent continuance in any domain, but information artifacts are restricted to domains where there are entities like people who make copies of things like email.

910
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:36,520
And so we added the term generically dependent continuance because it was of the appropriate level to go into a top level ontology.

911
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:42,520
And now I don't think I'll go into this one maybe.

912
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:48,520
So in we now realize that we needed to add a new relation.

913
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:54,520
So let's suppose you make a plan, you maybe write it down, and it's in your head.

914
01:11:54,520 --> 01:12:02,520
And you're going to deal and you have a team of people ready to follow the specification that you dictate.

915
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:16,520
Then the plan is concretized in patterns of ink on your printed document where you've been writing out or written document.

916
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:22,520
In other words, it's made concrete, it's turned into something which is more like a specifically dependent continuum.

917
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:32,520
Patterns of ink, different piles of ink, raised levels of ink, we call letters of the alphabet.

918
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:40,520
And also when you read the plan specification in your head, and there's something like a concretization of the plan in your head.

919
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:48,520
And that's what you will realize that will be the starting point for your realizing plan when you say you read it and you say to yourself I like this plan.

920
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:55,520
Let's realize this plan and then you tell all your underlings to go forth and realize.

921
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:01,520
And so we added the relation of concretization to BFO and the whole story looks like this.

922
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:09,520
So we have generic independent continuance, then there are information entities, there are things like gene sequences on the other side, the biological side.

923
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,520
And these are all examples of information artifacts.

924
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:21,520
So a symphony by that we mean that which is concretized in the score.

925
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:28,520
And sort of in the performance too. The performance is not so important, it's the score which matters.

926
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:36,520
And poems are the same.

927
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:45,520
And then we have information bearing entities, which are material entities, they have patterns according to what has been written onto them.

928
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:54,520
The pattern on your hard drive is an information quality entity, which is a kind of quality, which is a kind of specifically dependent continuum.

929
01:13:54,520 --> 01:14:03,520
And then the information content, so the information artifact is concretized by the information quality entity which depends upon the information bearing entity.

930
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,520
All right. And that's the definition.

931
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:16,520
So an artifact is something created deliberately and an information artifact is an artifact that can be the bearer of information.

932
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:22,520
All right. Now we have more time for question. Anybody.

933
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:29,520
So my question is regarding the, you mentioned that UFO is a realist.

934
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,520
Yeah.

935
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:38,520
But we're wondering like, which isn't do you think it's the presentism or the universe.

936
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:42,520
We're wondering maybe you can affect all the plants that are there.

937
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:49,520
So I hate four-dimensionalists. And so there are some people who develop four-dimensionalist ontologies.

938
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:54,520
And we could talk for an hour about this.

939
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:59,520
And the oil industry actually is the principle hunting ground of these people.

940
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:12,520
I was a, for a time, a hero of our oil engineers in Norway because they were being forced to use a four-dimensional ontology and it made their life much more difficult than it needed to be made.

941
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:18,520
I don't like four-dimensionalist ontologies. And I think that they are incoherent.

942
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:38,520
And it's interesting that of all the ontologies which have been, which have some sort of a track record, namely psych, dolce, BFO, GFO, UFO, sumo, they're all three plus one dimensional.

943
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:42,520
In other words, three spatial and one temporal ontology.

944
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,520
None of them are four-dimensional. Four-dimensional ontology says that everything is a process.

945
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:51,520
So you are a process of, what's your name? Eric.

946
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:57,520
You're a process of continual erring. Continual erring going on over in that corner.

947
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:06,520
And that's silly. And it's really silly if you want to apply it to oil industry plant because the plant is not a process.

948
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:13,520
Also maybe like you have a present system that you just have a present and growing growth that you have a present and a past.

949
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:23,520
Yeah. So I guess I'd lean a little way towards the block version, but I left open the issue of reality in the future.

950
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:31,520
And I also left open the big Q question, which if we got time, we will actually address.

951
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,520
I was wondering about the generically dependent continuum.

952
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:40,520
On the one hand, we have some very simple examples of patterns, which are universal.

953
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:45,520
And maybe the chessboard pattern could be regarded as a universal. It's simply.

954
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:52,520
But if you take the pattern, which is the fields of Norway, that's too complicated to be a university.

955
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:58,520
It has to be thrown together by accidents. We know that it was by accidents and glaciation.

956
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,520
Many millennia, I guess.

957
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:06,520
Now, Tolstoy's war and peace was more like the Theodos of Norway.

958
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:11,520
And even a relatively short poem is more like Theodos of Norway.

959
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:18,520
And even the president of Italy, the president, the office is more like the Theodos of Norway.

960
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:29,520
Now, where is the line between Theodos of Norway type things on the one hand and universal, like square or triangle or vowel or...

961
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,520
I don't know. DNA.

962
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:36,520
Well, DNA, I think is on the Norway side of things.

963
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:39,520
So the DNA molecule is a universal.

964
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:47,520
But this DNA molecule, for which we need 36,000 lines of code or something in order to capture, that is not the universe.

965
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:52,520
Even though it's repeated many times, war and peace is repeated many times.

966
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,520
But that doesn't mean it's the universe.

967
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:59,520
War and peace is an instance. It's an instance of the type novel.

968
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:04,520
A copy of war and peace is an instance.

969
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:08,520
It's an instance of the type copy of war and peace.

970
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:12,520
But copy of war and peace is not going to count as a real university.

971
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:16,520
It's going to be a defining class. It's going to be a convenience class.

972
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,520
Okay, so now I'm going to talk about foundry.

973
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,520
So this is a hub and spokes picture that I like.

974
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:32,520
The idea is that when we build a foundry, we're networking ontology.

975
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,520
So the networking arises in a number of different ways.

976
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,520
So first of all, you start with the hub, which in many cases is BFO.

977
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,520
And then you define domain ontology terms by using the hub.

978
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:47,520
So you'd use the word object as a starting point for defining a cell.

979
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:53,520
And then you create all the different kinds of cells and you package the whole thing as a cell ontology.

980
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,520
And you do that for many other things. And it is being done for many other things.

981
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:04,520
But now in each case, when you introduce a new term and thereby a new class in your ontology,

982
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,520
you define that term.

983
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:12,520
And very often you will use terms from other ontologies in your network.

984
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:19,520
And all of these terms, both the terms as defined and the terms as they appear in definitions,

985
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,520
will be associated with IRI.

986
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:26,520
So they will be networked together within the internet.

987
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:32,520
But also they will be networked together because the same term might be used in 17 different definitions

988
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,520
from 14 different ontologies.

989
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:42,520
And so there are networking effects across ontologies through terms and through internet connections.

990
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:50,520
And the oboe foundry now has reached the point where it can maintain the ontologies as a whole,

991
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,520
where you make one change in one term.

992
01:19:53,520 --> 01:20:01,520
Then that means that when that change is made, it may have impacts on the 14 other places where that term is used.

993
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:10,520
And they can control how these impacts are spread through the entire network in a very impressive way.

994
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:16,520
All right. Now, how do we go about building a top-level ontology?

995
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:30,520
So I was in a meeting in somewhere in, I can't remember where it was, in Europe, not long ago.

996
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,520
And there was a poster session.

997
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:37,520
And in the poster session, there were seven young ontologists.

998
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:44,520
All of them were working on slightly different aspects of, I don't know, lasers or something.

999
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:50,520
And they all had sort of interesting results and interesting bits of a laser process ontology.

1000
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:54,520
But they were all working independently of each other.

1001
01:20:54,520 --> 01:21:00,520
And I said, it's clear that you are all working on the same arena of topics.

1002
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:05,520
You should get together and build some kind of a foundry.

1003
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,520
Or you should find other people who have already built a relevant foundry.

1004
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:14,520
So you want to build a foundry.

1005
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:20,520
You've decided that you don't want to continue to build small snippets of bits of ontology for yourself.

1006
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:24,520
You want to do things which will contribute to science in the public sense.

1007
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:34,520
And so you choose your top level, which should be small and well-documented and so forth.

1008
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,520
So BFO might be chosen.

1009
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,520
And your top level should have understandable definitions.

1010
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:47,520
We're working on that, but we think we do pretty well, given the complexity of some of our needs.

1011
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,520
It should be well formalized.

1012
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,520
Well, we think we're doing pretty well on that front.

1013
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,520
And this is the crucial thing.

1014
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:58,520
It should be easily extendable by domain ontology.

1015
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,520
So you need to know what a laser is.

1016
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,520
Well, a laser is an object in BFO terms.

1017
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,520
What is laser light?

1018
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,520
What is the operation of a laser?

1019
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,520
Well, you can find BFO terms for those things too.

1020
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:16,520
And you can define them in such a way that you link the terms in your laser ontologies together through BFO.

1021
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:23,520
And then because you're using BFO, you'll have people like me who can look at what you're doing and tell you that you're doing it wrong.

1022
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,520
Or right even.

1023
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:32,520
Where if you have your own secret methodology, then probably no one will ever tell you that you're doing it wrong.

1024
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:39,520
And BFO also changes only slowly, which means you can trust it to have a half-life of five years.

1025
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,520
And even then the change will be quite small.

1026
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:50,520
And BFO is aggressively quality controlled.

1027
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:58,520
And there are various principles that we impose upon the ontologies in the foundry.

1028
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,520
So you have to have a top level.

1029
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:10,520
There are some foundries which have been developed, which didn't have top levels, but they had relatively short half-lives.

1030
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:17,520
You want to create ontology modules which are consistently developed,

1031
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:28,520
which means that each group of developers of ontology A will be comparing notes with the developers of ontologies B, C and D,

1032
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:33,520
because they are in neighboring domains to ensure consistency.

1033
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:40,520
But you will also be communicating with the BCD people to make sure that there are no overlaps.

1034
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:48,520
And the reason for that is that you want everybody to know where you find the ontology for proteins.

1035
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:54,520
And if there are protein ontology terms in the RNA ontology or in the cell ontology,

1036
01:23:54,520 --> 01:24:01,520
then that will mean that people will be disappointed when they find that they've been using the protein ontology for seven years.

1037
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:10,520
And no one told them about those proteins which, for forgotten reasons, were dealt with in cell ontology.

1038
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:19,520
So, non-overlapping ontology modules which are developed in such a way as to be consistent.

1039
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:30,520
And then what you need is users who will find gaps and errors and who will help you create useful documentation.

1040
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:39,520
And I talked already about the virtuous cycle which arises when you have many users who point out mistakes in your ontology or gaps in your ontology.

1041
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:46,520
And for that, and this is also an important principle, you need an effective feedback loop.

1042
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:58,520
So, I don't know how it is today, but in the olden days, the gene ontology had a commitment to its users that they would have a response to feedback within 48 hours.

1043
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:05,520
Now, the response was not always an answer to the question, but it would be at least an answer of the form.

1044
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:13,520
We are now exploring the question you raised, but very often they gave answers to questions directly.

1045
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:18,520
The most common answer would be the term you are looking for is already there.

1046
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:22,520
It's just four lines lower down and three lines across.

1047
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:27,520
So, effective feedback loops between the users and the developers.

1048
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:32,520
And that too creates a virtuous cycle.

1049
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,520
All right, so there are many foundries.

1050
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:42,520
This is the digital construction ontology's foundry which goes on in Finland.

1051
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:51,520
And they have all of these ontologies which are about bin, which is building information management, modeling.

1052
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,520
Anyway, they have a lot of data.

1053
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:06,520
And they have these ontologies which are developed in just the way that I am recommending as modules in a BFO framework.

1054
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:22,520
And you can see the BFO here is a pancake shaped or amoeba shaped grouping in blue at the top and then all the building terms descend from there.

1055
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:30,520
So, asset roll descends from roll, for instance, legal person roll descends from roll.

1056
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:41,520
We have a disaster response ontologies foundry which has been developed in France for the French disaster relief agencies.

1057
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:46,520
And now most importantly, we have the dialogue foundry.

1058
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:51,520
I say most importantly, partly for purely chronological reasons.

1059
01:26:51,520 --> 01:27:02,520
So, we've been working for 12 years to get the dialogue foundry ontologies recognition on the part of the...

1060
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:08,520
So, dialogue means the Department of Defense and the intelligence community.

1061
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:12,520
So, the work was ignored or forgotten.

1062
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:17,520
The working group was very active and then it died and then it became active again.

1063
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:30,520
Finally, in June of this year, just a few days ago, we got definitive approval from high level officers,

1064
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:40,520
not just of the intelligence community, but also from the Department of Defense, Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office,

1065
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:49,520
formally recognizing the foundry projects or the foundry project plus a number of sub-projects

1066
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:59,520
put forward by various DoD and IC agencies with a bit of help from ontology people on the academic side like me,

1067
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:04,520
that they were going to be accepted as the standard across the DoD and the IC.

1068
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:09,520
Now, next comes NATO.

1069
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,520
That's next week. Actually, no, next week.

1070
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:17,520
There is a NATO meeting at which this idea will be presented.

1071
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:23,520
We only get 15 minutes in a three-day meeting, but it's the beginning.

1072
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,520
And who knows what comes after NATO?

1073
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:29,520
Well, this is what it might look like.

1074
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:37,520
So this is the daiko verse like universe, but daiko is the Defense Intelligence Core ontology.

1075
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:45,520
This is a group of ontologies, some of which don't exist yet, but there are teams of people who are building them or planning to build them,

1076
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:49,520
some of which are already in use, the green ones are already in use.

1077
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:57,520
And the idea is that the one of the ideas is that if you have a foundry like this,

1078
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,520
and this is a small version in different colors of the same foundry,

1079
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:08,520
then this will create not just interoperability among data, but also cross-organizational knowledge.

1080
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:18,520
So people working in the process activity ontology world will know to some degree what's going on in the geographic features domain

1081
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:23,520
because they're both building ontologies which use the same top level and they form part of the same foundry,

1082
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:28,520
which means that they communicate with each other at regular meetings.

1083
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:37,520
So I think I'd better say something about time.

1084
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:46,520
So as you can hear from my throat, I won't be able to do this forever.

1085
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:50,520
I'm not planning on any changes, but there might be changes in the future.

1086
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:54,520
And so we have a kind of succession plan for BFO.

1087
01:29:54,520 --> 01:30:04,520
So the replacement king of ontology or king of BFO more precisely, you will hear from him in a few minutes.

1088
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:09,520
He's going to give a short talk about current developments in the BFO world.

1089
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:15,520
His name is John Beverly and he was just hired in our department in Buffalo.

1090
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:25,520
Before that he worked for the Applied Physics Lab, which is a very large physics faculty which runs on government money.

1091
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:37,520
They do physics for the government, for the DOD, but they have an ontology group which is populated primarily by former students of mine.

1092
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:46,520
And he is one of them, but he's coming back to Buffalo because he believes in this succession plan.

1093
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:55,520
But there is another member of the BFO succession, which he will not be talking today, but his name is Alan Rottenberg.

1094
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:01,520
Now Alan Rottenberg is a pain in the neck, but he's also brilliant.

1095
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:06,520
So John Beverly is brilliant. He's not a pain in the neck.

1096
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:10,520
Alan is a pain in the neck because he wants to get everything right.

1097
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:18,520
Owl has a problem. It's very hard to get time right in owl.

1098
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:25,520
And BFO is not a four-dimensionalist ontology. It's a three plus T dimensional ontology.

1099
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:30,520
In other three spaces, of course, one central dimension, we want to get time right.

1100
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:37,520
One solution is not to use owl, but to use first-order logic. It's easy to get time right using first-order logic.

1101
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:43,520
It's very hard to get time right in owl because owl will only allow two-place relations.

1102
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:56,520
So you can say John loves Mary, you can say Mary loves John, but you can't say Mary loves John yesterday or tomorrow in owl because then you have a three-place relation.

1103
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:02,520
Now Alan first of all understands owl probably better than anybody else.

1104
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:09,520
So he plays three-dimensional chess with owl where the chess games extend into five years into the future.

1105
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,520
So he knows what problems lurk behind the scenes.

1106
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:23,520
And he knows that the current treatment of time in BFO actually and in any other ontology based on owl is problematic.

1107
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:32,520
And for that reason, we released a version. It wasn't an official release.

1108
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:44,520
It was a version released for public debate, which just deleted all the temporal relations which are affected by these out problems from the ontology.

1109
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:55,520
So the classes were there, there is a hierarchy was there, all the time relations involving processes were there, but all the time relations involving occurrence were deleted.

1110
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:01,520
And people hated that and they said, oh, BFO, it's become chaotic.

1111
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:08,520
In fact, we were trying to be very, very careful and avoiding logical problems which we knew lay down the road.

1112
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:15,520
And if I had more time, I could describe those logical problems.

1113
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:20,520
Now we have found a way which keeps everybody happy.

1114
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:29,520
So we're going to have a release version and John Beverly will talk a little bit about that when he joins us in half an hour or so.

1115
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:37,520
But let me just describe Alan's solution. Alan's solution to these problems is indeed a solution.

1116
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:42,520
No one will like it very much because it's more complicated than what they like to see.

1117
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:53,520
But the solution goes like this. You can't say John does Mary at time t because that's a three place relation.

1118
01:33:53,520 --> 01:34:00,520
But if you define a new relation called loves at some time.

1119
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:12,520
And another universe, another new relation called loves at all time, then you can say John loves Mary at all times and that's a two place relation.

1120
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:18,520
Loves at all times is a two place relation. John and Mary are the two places fillers.

1121
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:27,520
And John loves Mary sometimes is also a two place relation where John and Mary fill the two places in loves at all times.

1122
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:40,520
Now you can generalize that you can generalize it to include John loves Mary at all times when the lights are switched on or when the grandmother is aware of you can generalize it but it gets more complicated.

1123
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:54,520
And so no one likes it. And so Alan is working with John Beverly and with other people on finding a solution to this temporary relation problem that everyone will be happy with.

1124
01:34:54,520 --> 01:35:05,520
Now, the old version, before we deleted some of the relations in this inspection version worked.

1125
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:13,520
So it had logical, small logical time bombs, small time loss built in, but it worked.

1126
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:17,520
No one noticed. No one had examples where these time bombs made any difference.

1127
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:22,520
Very hard to find examples where these time bombs make a difference and they're usually quite artificial.

1128
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:34,520
So it's not a big problem in the practical sense. It's only a problem in the logical sense. If we want to get the logic right, we have to address temporalized relations.

1129
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:40,520
So I'm not going to say anything more about that. I'm just filling you in on what goes on behind the scenes.

1130
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:52,520
The piece that John Beverly will talk about in a few minutes is logically in good shape and it's also practically in good shape and the sense that you can understand it quite quickly and it seems natural.

1131
01:35:52,520 --> 01:36:02,520
All right. So now summary on BFO. I seem to remember that I have 200 slides here. So I'm not going to finish.

1132
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:11,520
So BFO is very small. It evolves slowly. It has an active user forum. It has a really large user base and there are lots of people who know how to use it.

1133
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:20,520
And we've seen the examples of suites. We've seen the Common Core ontologies. We've seen the principles. Talked about this already. I don't want to do all of this again.

1134
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:28,520
This is more about the dates when these decisions were made. I keep repeating this. I must like it.

1135
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:36,520
And this is one more piece that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has approved recommending BFO as the standard.

1136
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:45,520
And the problem is if you work with the intelligence community, you can't always know what they're doing and they can't always know what to do.

1137
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:58,520
But he's created a space where ontologies can be developed with all the classification rules in place and maintained by people who know what they're doing.

1138
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:06,520
And now the final piece in this puzzle is that Ryan Rikuchi over here, put your hand up, Ryan.

1139
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:19,520
Ryan Rikuchi is in charge of a working group in the Department of Homeland Security to do for the Department of Homeland Security, which is, I don't know, 32 agencies or something like that.

1140
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:30,520
What the DoDIC ontology working group is doing for the Department of Defense and the intelligence community. And he knows what he's talking about and he's very effective.

1141
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:41,520
And E2 is going to be using BFO and it's going to be covering areas like infrastructure, cyber security and so forth. Do you want to add anything?

1142
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,520
You might as well.

1143
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:58,520
Well, I would say that we have two successful test events. We're working prototype for surveillance-enabled pattern recognition for sensors to be able to detect and reason autonomously about things in the air and take out,

1144
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:09,520
human-in-a-loop tasks and then automate analyst queries for the routine things. We don't want to ask again and again that we can use computers to do instead of people because people are prone to error and so on.

1145
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:18,520
And the second thing that we have going, we have five different ontology lines of effort that are not just thinking about it or talking about it. We're off the whiteboard into practical application.

1146
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:32,520
And the second thing is working out in person-centric ontology so we can reason about the different types of people that come into our care to automate determining what they're entitled for resources and how we consume resources to then inform a classic optimization problem.

1147
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:41,520
What to do with people in the walk order with the transportation logistics and self-capacities and medical care to treat people as expeditiously safe and humanely as possible.

1148
01:38:41,520 --> 01:39:00,520
So those are the type of problems that we're working on, time out with practical applications that we want to extend and then across the agency we're thinking about how to go about the next making sense of this big conglomeration of agencies that all have overlapping missions but very unique roles and we share work and leverage the virtuous cycle of development.

1149
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:01,520
Thanks very much.

1150
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:07,520
I will be here till the end of these two weeks.

1151
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:17,520
So he's already given, I was going to say take away two of my students by giving them jobs.

1152
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:34,520
The way of viewing an ontology is that it's a computable lexicon. So a lot of what I've been talking about is getting people in different groups to use terms consistently, which means to use terms that have definitions which people share.

1153
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:51,520
And the terms are almost, no, I was in very many cases, ordinary terms that ordinary people understand. In biology you have, you very quickly move into very technical terms, but even there they are terms which ordinary biologists understand.

1154
01:39:51,520 --> 01:40:20,520
And this is one big difference between ontology and databases. So if ontology is a regulation of the lexicon and if the lexicon changes rather slowly, then that means that you can find in ontology a kind of infrastructure which will last for many years as long as

1155
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:32,520
people who use those terms in that way last databases on the other hand move very quickly, but database technology database hardware and database software changes very quickly.

1156
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:47,520
And you can make up database codes and new database structures also rather easily, which means that it doesn't provide this kind of foundation over long periods of time, which we find if we look at the ordinary lexicon.

1157
01:40:47,520 --> 01:41:04,520
So ontology tries to have the best of both worlds wants to have the kind of logical coherence that you find in database structures but conjoined with the kind of stability that you get from the lexicon.

1158
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:19,520
And then that is how ontologies get to be used in large enterprises, including the Department of Defense. In large enterprises currently where data models dominate of one sort or another, the data models that people understand in one

1159
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:34,520
enterprise will be completely unintelligible to data models used by people in such to the users of data model from other parts of the enterprise and every large enterprise data manager realizes these problems.

1160
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:53,520
The Department of Defense realizes them. And that's one of the reasons for the tiny enthusiasm that they'd be begun to show about introducing ontology. I mean, in the Department of Homeland Security, there is a lot of enthusiasm, but in the Department of Defense, it's taken 12 years to get where we are.

1161
01:41:53,520 --> 01:42:14,520
All right. Now, so we solve the failures of interoperability across large organizations by introducing terminological consistency. So common terms used consistently with common definitions, both in natural language, not dictionary definitions, but form but semi formal natural

1162
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:40,520
definitions and then logical definitions in logical languages like our own and first order logic, for instance. And so I've said something about this. Now, let's look at definitions, which is the important part. Now, if you look at definitions, and this is true in many, many highly reputable organizations, they are really impressingly bad.

1163
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:58,520
They don't really know what a definition is commonly. So they're worse than dictionary definition. But look at many of the W3C publications and see what they, how they define basic words. So RDF, Army's resource.

1164
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:10,520
Look at what, look at the definition of resource in the official RBS specification. It's not, it doesn't tell you anything. Maybe because the word resource is not meant to tell you.

1165
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:25,520
All right. So we want formal definitions for computer reasoning and we want natural language definitions for human use. And in both cases, we want real definitions. Now, what is a real definition?

1166
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:36,520
Well, it, I'm talking now about definitions for the terms in the ontology, not for the relations. In other words, not for the object, just for the terms in the is a hierarchy.

1167
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:46,520
Definitions should be each definition should be a statement of individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions.

1168
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:59,520
Now, what does that mean? Well, look at the definition for a triangle at the bottom here. A triangle is a closed figure. It has exactly three sides. Each of these sizes straight and it lies in a plane.

1169
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:08,520
It may be that we have too much here, but we can simplify it a little bit. But all of these are necessary.

1170
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:16,520
In other words, every triangle is a closed figure. It is necessary of a triangle that it is a closed figure.

1171
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:26,520
And all of them together are jointly sufficient. That is to say anything which satisfies everything on the right hand side is a triangle.

1172
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:33,520
Now, this is what a definition should look like how to build definitions like this is coming next.

1173
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:47,520
So this is a slightly simplified version of what we had before. And now here we have a certain form X is a triangle means X is a closed figure, which.

1174
01:44:48,520 --> 01:45:07,520
And now we can assume that a closed figure is going to be the parent of triangle in the backbone taxonomy of geometrical figures, along with square and the other ones rectangle circle.

1175
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,520
They're all closed figures.

1176
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:21,520
Now that's the key to a good definition. A good definition is a definition which specifies of its parent term.

1177
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:32,520
What are the necessary features that an instance of that parent term has to have if it's going to be an instance of the term on the left.

1178
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,520
So I'll repeat that.

1179
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:38,520
I won't. I will repeat it in a minute.

1180
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:48,520
So in the philosophical position, the which clause is called the specific difference.

1181
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:55,520
The term that you're defining is called the species and the parent term is called the genus.

1182
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:04,520
An example would be human being is defined as an animal.

1183
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:08,520
That's the parent term, which is rational.

1184
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:11,520
That's what Aristotle said.

1185
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:23,520
Every definition should be an Aristotelian definition in just that sense when it's a definition of a term, except now we come to the the following issue.

1186
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:40,520
Namely, there are some terms which are just so basic that you can't specify a parent term that would give you any additional meaning in the way in which human is a rational animal gives you additional meaning to the term animal.

1187
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:48,520
Or triangle is a closed figure, which has exactly three sides, gives you additional meaning to closed figure.

1188
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:49,520
You can't do that with object.

1189
01:46:49,520 --> 01:47:02,520
I can't explain what an object is by telling you that it's a thing which is object or thing which is connected or an entity which just one object is too basic.

1190
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:14,520
And so every ontology is going to have primitive terms, which cannot be defined, and they will come at the very top of the relevant or near the very top of the relevant ontology tree, the back bone taxonomy.

1191
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:26,520
And it's not that we are completely dumb or dumbfounded when it comes to primitive terms, but we can only provide what we call elucidations.

1192
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,520
They're not definitions.

1193
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:36,520
They are just necessary conditions, plus maybe some examples of how the term is to be used.

1194
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:39,520
All right, now this is the recipe.

1195
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:49,520
For a good definition, you have a parent term, you have the term you want to define, which is B in this case, and you have the specific difference, which is C.

1196
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:54,520
And then you define B as an A which sees.

1197
01:47:54,520 --> 01:48:07,520
And this is, it's such a simple approach, but 99% of the definitions in otherwise highly reputable ontologies do not use this recipe.

1198
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:16,520
And the recipe has the neat consequence that writing definitions is a good check on the quality of your taxonomy.

1199
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:24,520
But also the taxonomy that you're building is a good step towards creating good definitions for the terms it contains.

1200
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:29,520
So you, in principle, you get the best of both worlds.

1201
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:33,520
All right, and now it doesn't work. That's the problem.

1202
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:38,520
It doesn't work in every case, but this too is not necessarily a bad thing.

1203
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,520
So this is the Aristotle example.

1204
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:41,520
This is what we want.

1205
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:44,520
We want our trees to look like this.

1206
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:56,520
Every term or every class in the is a taxonomy has exactly one parent except for the very highest classes, which don't have any.

1207
01:48:56,520 --> 01:49:06,520
As long as every class has exactly one parent, we can use the Aristotelian rule for definitions without any problems.

1208
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:12,520
But some, some people build ontologies and they have diamonds in them.

1209
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:16,520
And by that, I do not mean diamonds in the rough.

1210
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:24,520
I mean diamonds, which cause the rough and and the Department of Homeland Security has ontologies, which are full of diamonds.

1211
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:29,520
And no, actually, which are suspiciously many times.

1212
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:34,520
And so a dam is a water asset, but it's also an electric power asset.

1213
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:36,520
Now, that's not quite true.

1214
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:40,520
Not every dam is an electric power asset.

1215
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:46,520
And so we have, we can easily chop away this one and just have water asset.

1216
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:48,520
Every dam is a water asset.

1217
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:56,520
And that's another general rule in good ontology building is always means every.

1218
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:59,520
So if you say a is a B, you mean every a is a B.

1219
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:02,520
If you say a is part of B, it's slightly different.

1220
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:10,520
If you say a is part of B, you mean every a is part of some B.

1221
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:21,520
And if you say a has part B, you mean every a is such that there is some B, which is a part of it.

1222
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:31,520
And then the sum goes before a hidden instance of so a is part of B means every instance of a has some.

1223
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:35,520
It is part of some instance of B.

1224
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,520
This is called the all some rule.

1225
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:47,520
So if there is a, it's just all every for other relations for lateral relations is all some every a is part of some B.

1226
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:50,520
Every a is just adjacent to some B.

1227
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,520
And so on.

1228
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:52,520
All right.

1229
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:57,520
Now, I think I'll just give you pictures of knowledge across.

1230
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:00,520
Oh, there's Ryan again.

1231
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:04,520
And more knowledge graphs.

1232
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:13,520
And so knowledge graphs give you some of the benefits of ontology together with some of the benefits of databases.

1233
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:29,520
Now, one of the reasons why the military in America and the AI part of the military in America are so interested in ontologies is because they think that on knowledge graphs are the way forward in collecting useful data.

1234
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:38,520
And to have well behaved knowledge perhaps it's very good to have coherently structured ontologies.

1235
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:43,520
And this is the physics part.

1236
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:51,520
I think I so should I finish with the physics part of the AI part.

1237
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,520
I guess I'll do the physics part.

1238
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:58,520
So although I can't do physics in 13 minutes.

1239
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:03,520
So, since the beginning of BFO.

1240
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:08,520
And actually, you were doing something very similar with your snow med question.

1241
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:16,520
I would receive requests from people that they needed a BFO conformant ontology of mathematics.

1242
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:20,520
And my response was, you don't need an ontology of mathematics.

1243
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,520
You just go to the supermarket.

1244
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:23,520
You can get your money.

1245
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:24,520
It's already there.

1246
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:25,520
It's all been done.

1247
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:26,520
There are no problems.

1248
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:34,520
And but now we need at least an ontology of units of measure.

1249
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:55,520
And if we're going to understand quantum physics, I use the keyword, then we're going to have to understand the mathematics of quantum physics because there isn't really much that you can understand outside mathematics when you're trying to do quantum physics.

1250
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:59,520
I think that at the moment, maybe things will get better.

1251
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:09,520
So we wrote this paper and I just mentioned that I co-authored with this man, Jobs Landkreber, a book which came out last year.

1252
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:24,520
Basically the book about the ontology of systems, both simple systems such as the solar system and a laptop and complex systems such as your digestive system or the government of Ukraine.

1253
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:30,520
You can't predict the behaviors of complex systems for complex reasons, which we document in the book.

1254
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:37,520
And therefore you can't build a Turing machine which can emulate the behaviors of complex systems.

1255
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:50,520
And therefore artificial general intelligence, that is to say artificial intelligence, which would be equal in power or superior in power to human intelligence is impossible.

1256
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:53,520
That's the argument of the book.

1257
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:59,520
All right, so in order to build a quantum physics ontology, we need to build a mathematics ontology.

1258
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:03,520
And mathematics is basically set theory.

1259
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:08,520
But understanding set theory ontologically is not trivial.

1260
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:11,520
And we didn't want everything to be set.

1261
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:19,520
So we wanted there to be some things which are part of the object domain of mathematics, which are not sets.

1262
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:32,520
Because there has to be a starting point for building the set theoretic structures, which are the various kinds of structures which mathematicians like to deal with.

1263
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:35,520
And we call these things monads.

1264
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:41,520
And we give examples of monad zero on constant a variable and a geometric point.

1265
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:48,520
We're not very happy with this selection, but we are confident that there has to be something like monads.

1266
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:51,520
We're going to build coherent ontology mathematics.

1267
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:56,520
Everything else is set theory or everything else is what you need to get set theory off the ground.

1268
01:54:56,520 --> 01:55:03,520
For instance, the set constructor, which takes a mathematical predicate and turns it into a set.

1269
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:05,520
This is the structure corner.

1270
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:09,520
So this here is a function.

1271
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:12,520
Every mathematical function has this structure.

1272
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:15,520
Every mathematical operator has this structure.

1273
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:20,520
That's the field of real numbers and there are other fields of natural numbers and so forth.

1274
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,520
None of these things fit into BFO.

1275
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:27,520
What we're doing, and we have to do something like this, we have BFO.

1276
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:32,520
We don't create math O as a child ontology BFO.

1277
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,520
We create it as a sibling.

1278
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:37,520
And we have physics, which will be a sibling of math.

1279
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:40,520
But there are some areas of overlap.

1280
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:46,520
So when it comes to physics, we have experiments and we have experimental results.

1281
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:51,520
They fall under BFO experiments are processes in the BFO send.

1282
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:56,520
So there are connections, even with the quantum world connection.

1283
01:55:56,520 --> 01:56:01,520
All right, so these are functionals and operators.

1284
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:06,520
And now we already have some ontology to deal with some physics.

1285
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:09,520
These are just for, I'm sure that there are others.

1286
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:12,520
OB is already a BFO conformant ontology.

1287
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:15,520
The open energy ontology is BFO conformant.

1288
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:20,520
The physics based simulation ontology is very small, but it is also BFO conformant.

1289
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:25,520
And the ontology of physics for biology, it wants to be BFO conformant.

1290
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:28,520
So we may use some of the content here in due course.

1291
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:31,520
But for the moment, we're working on the fundamental.

1292
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:33,520
And this is where systems come in.

1293
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:39,520
So systems form the heart of the AI book, simple systems and complex systems.

1294
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:43,520
And we think that there are three important kinds of physics entity.

1295
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:48,520
In other words, important in the sense that we believe that if we get three kinds of entity right,

1296
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:55,520
then we will have dealt with all of the important kinds of entities in the realm of physics.

1297
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,520
System entities are three kinds.

1298
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:59,520
They're a system element.

1299
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:03,520
When it says weight here, it does not mean the measurement weight.

1300
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:07,520
It means that an actual lump of metal used with a weight.

1301
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:11,520
And so we have elements such as weights or people or planets.

1302
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,520
Planets are parts of systems.

1303
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:19,520
Then we have interactions between these elements such as electromagnetic interaction or gravity.

1304
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:27,520
And then we have the system itself, which is in the case we had in mind in the paper, is a weight on a spring.

1305
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:30,520
So the harmonic oscillator, you have a spring and you have a weight.

1306
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:33,520
And the weight goes up and down harmonically.

1307
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:37,520
And the harmonic oscillator is a very important physical system,

1308
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:40,520
which is found also in biology and chemistry everywhere,

1309
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:47,520
and which we document in the paper ontologically as our example of classical physics.

1310
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,520
And then we have magnitudes.

1311
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:51,520
This was always a very hard problem.

1312
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:58,520
And we still haven't corrected completely for BFO how to understand things like velocity or acceleration.

1313
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:04,520
Because for complex reasons, BFO only allows continuance to have quality.

1314
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:11,520
It doesn't allow qualities of processing and velocity sound like the quality of a process.

1315
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:15,520
And so we just introduced the idea of a process.

1316
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:17,520
We don't call it a process quality.

1317
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,520
We call it a process factoristic.

1318
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:23,520
That is a term which was already being used by the Eauble foundry.

1319
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:27,520
And acceleration would be an example of a process characteristic.

1320
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:30,520
And I think what we're doing here is pretty coherent.

1321
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:34,520
It's not rocket science, but it's at least coherent.

1322
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:38,520
And then finally, we have models.

1323
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:41,520
And this brings it back to the oscillator.

1324
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:45,520
So if you have a spring and you have a weight at the end of spring,

1325
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,520
you pull the weight, it will vibrate for a while.

1326
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:50,520
And then because of friction, it will come to rest.

1327
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:53,520
That's a real thing, a real process.

1328
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:56,520
But physics doesn't describe real processes.

1329
01:58:56,520 --> 01:59:03,520
Physics describes idealized, even mathematicized counterparts of those real processes.

1330
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:08,520
So a force oscillated with dampening is never realized in the real world.

1331
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:17,520
Just as the mathematical closed figure called a circle is never realized in the real world.

1332
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:19,520
There are no circles.

1333
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:23,520
Meaning there are no perfect circles in the mathematical sense.

1334
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:26,520
And similarly, there are no force oscillators.

1335
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:33,520
What we mean by force oscillator, the idealized case described by the equations of physics.

1336
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:37,520
So models are important because they describe the idealization.

1337
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:43,520
And now we do experiments in order to work out whether these idealizations in fact capture reality.

1338
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:47,520
And if they do, we get our little green badge and we're a physicist.

1339
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:51,520
And if they don't, we go back to work to do more experiments.

1340
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:59,520
So models on this view are essential features of physics because physics deals not with reality, but with models.

1341
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:00,520
All right.

1342
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:02,520
And so, well, we've seen all of that.

1343
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:05,520
These are some examples of systems.

1344
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:13,520
So systems, simple systems like these are such that the system behavior can be predicted using classical physics.

1345
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:18,520
And so the behavior of simple systems may be church during computable.

1346
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:30,520
In other words, it may be that we can have computer can emulate the simple system, but complex systems are not going to be emulated by a machine.

1347
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:34,520
And these are the, these are some examples of complex systems.

1348
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:38,520
And the New York Stock Exchange.

1349
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:40,520
And this is the book again.

1350
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:43,520
And then now we're back to physics.

1351
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:46,520
So magnitudes in classical physics are described here.

1352
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:49,520
And I don't have time to go through this.

1353
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:52,520
This is our ontology of magnitudes.

1354
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:53,520
Oh, sorry.

1355
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:57,520
This is what we had before just with examples that you can read now.

1356
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:03,520
This is more on models, what models are, how we build them.

1357
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:06,520
The models are built by people.

1358
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:11,520
And that's all classical physics, roughly pre 1906.

1359
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:16,520
Modern physics is general relativity theory plus quantum physics.

1360
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:26,520
And the heart of quantum physics anyway is the idea of a Hilbert space, which we can already fit into our original mathematics ontology.

1361
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:38,520
So a Hilbert space is a sub kind of the kind metric space, which is sub kind of the kind vector space, which is a sub kind of the kind algebraic structure, which is a sub kind of the kind structure, all of that is in the mathematics ontology.

1362
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:41,520
And you can't do quantum physics without physics.

1363
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:47,520
And, well, this is more, you can't do quantum physics without the idea of inner product.

1364
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:51,520
And without the idea of operators and projectors and so on.

1365
02:01:51,520 --> 02:02:00,520
And so the Feynman said, if you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics.

1366
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:07,520
They say, in fact, I think what he really said was this, that we can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.

1367
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:10,520
Now, what did he mean?

1368
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:12,520
So what are the domains which we can understand?

1369
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:15,520
Now, I think we can understand the domain of mathematics.

1370
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,520
Mathematicians understand mathematics.

1371
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:19,520
There's no mystery about that.

1372
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:22,520
They build it and they understand.

1373
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:26,520
What else can we understand apart from mathematics?

1374
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:33,520
Answer is the domain of everything which falls under BFO.

1375
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:35,520
That's it.

1376
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:40,520
And so that's why we can't understand quantum mechanics because it doesn't fall under BFO.

1377
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:44,520
And so some mathematics common sense.

1378
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:47,520
So what is the common sense domain?

1379
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:50,520
Now, we didn't make this up.

1380
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:53,520
There is a certain amount of theory on common sense.

1381
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:56,520
It goes under the name primary theory.

1382
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:05,520
Primary, and this actually gets deep into the heart of ISOIC to want to create that too.

1383
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:09,520
Robin Horton was an anthropologist who lived in Africa.

1384
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:11,520
I think he was born in Africa.

1385
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:18,520
He worked on the worldviews of different cultures, both Western and non-Western.

1386
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:24,520
And he decided that there were two kinds of worldviews which you can formulate as theories.

1387
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:35,520
One is primary theory and that is a theory which is about the common sense world.

1388
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:42,520
The boats and snowballs and leaves and food and drinks and so on.

1389
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:48,520
The things that you need in order to survive and behave in an everyday world.

1390
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:56,520
And then secondary theory are theories which you only find in one culture or another which are not shared by every culture.

1391
02:03:56,520 --> 02:04:09,520
Examples of secondary theory would be quantum mechanics, Catholicism, Pythagoreans, which is the view that everything is made of nuns.

1392
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:14,520
Panpsychism, which is the view that everything in the universe is conscious.

1393
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:18,520
And solipsism, which is the view that only I exist.

1394
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:21,520
All of these are secondary theories.

1395
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:26,520
And now primary theory, common sense, is definable.

1396
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:29,520
It's that which all cultures share.

1397
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:35,520
And that is, roughly speaking, what you find in BFO, roughly speaking.

1398
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,520
Mathematics is in the one side of...

1399
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:40,520
Well, little bits of mathematics, but not much.

1400
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:44,520
There are some cultures which are very small amounts of mathematics.

1401
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:47,520
And so it goes like this.

1402
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:49,520
You can study this while we...

1403
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:52,520
Can we see if we can contact John?

1404
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:54,520
He should by now be...

1405
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:56,520
Oh, I'm here.

1406
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:57,520
So that's John.

1407
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:58,520
No, fine.

1408
02:04:58,520 --> 02:04:59,520
Yeah, this is...

1409
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:00,520
Hi, I'm John.

1410
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:02,520
Well, let me find the slides for...

1411
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:03,520
Here we go.

1412
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:04,520
Hi, everybody.

1413
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:06,520
John Beverly, that's me at the top.

1414
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:07,520
And also on your screen.

1415
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:12,520
I'm going to be talking today about implementations of BFO.

1416
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:16,520
Because there's sometimes some confusion about the difference between BFOs

1417
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:22,520
used as a broad data model and BFO in its actual, you know, everyday hour.

1418
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:26,520
And so I'm here to shed some light and illuminate that.

1419
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:30,520
As you see, John Beverly, professor at the University of Buffalo,

1420
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:34,520
colleague of Barry's, speaking here in capacity,

1421
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:37,520
VP for the National Center of Ontological Research

1422
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:40,520
and representative of the BFO community.

1423
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:41,520
So here's what we'll do.

1424
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:45,520
I'm going to talk about BFO ontology repo updates,

1425
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:48,520
repo, a GitHub repo, because we have a lot of our...

1426
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:50,520
We have our artifacts on a GitHub repo.

1427
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:54,520
I'll also talk about clarification around some implementations of BFO,

1428
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:56,520
what it means to implement BFO.

1429
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:57,520
I'll do this real quick.

1430
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:59,520
I know you guys probably want to go eat some pizza.

1431
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:00,520
I saw the schedules pizza day.

1432
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:02,520
I won't keep you from it.

1433
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:06,520
Then we'll talk about a core BFO file and then temporal extensions.

1434
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:08,520
And this is where it's going to get interesting.

1435
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:10,520
So if you know anything about BFO,

1436
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:13,520
you can probably already tell why it's going to be interesting.

1437
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:16,520
And if you don't, well, hold on to your horses.

1438
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:17,520
Okay. Here we go.

1439
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:18,520
Clarifications.

1440
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:21,520
So there has been some confusion concerning which BFO file

1441
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:23,520
and the repo folks should use.

1442
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:25,520
And that, that makes sense.

1443
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:26,520
If you go to the GitHub repo,

1444
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:29,520
I have a screenshot of what it used to look like over there,

1445
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:30,520
right here on the right.

1446
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:31,520
It's a little confusing.

1447
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:35,520
You got the 21838-2, definitely ISO.

1448
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,520
Good reference to ISO.

1449
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:40,520
But you also see file or directories like common logic model

1450
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:44,520
and a bunch of the files in different formats named BFO.

1451
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:46,520
It's a little hard to parse sometimes.

1452
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:47,520
Not the best documentation.

1453
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:48,520
This is not knocking Alan.

1454
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:49,520
I love Alan.

1455
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:51,520
Alan did amazing work, but you know,

1456
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:52,520
documentation is important.

1457
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:55,520
So we're clarifying, cleaning this up.

1458
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:58,520
So here's, here's the new structure.

1459
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:00,520
And I'll walk through it real quick.

1460
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:04,520
The development team, myself included work to clear this up

1461
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:05,520
that is easier to understand.

1462
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:06,520
It's on a fork right now.

1463
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:08,520
I'm going to merge it shortly,

1464
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:10,520
but here's the structure over on the right.

1465
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:11,520
It should be clear.

1466
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:14,520
And if it's not, hold on.

1467
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:19,520
So we know that BFO is described in the standard

1468
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:21,520
and described in this building ontology,

1469
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:23,520
the basic formal ontology book,

1470
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:26,520
describes a theory that outstrips the,

1471
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:30,520
the, the expressivity of owl, right?

1472
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:32,520
Which is what we typically use when we,

1473
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:35,520
we're dealing with BFO or any ontologies, really.

1474
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:40,520
So there, there are lots of different implementations of BFO.

1475
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:44,520
Some of which more accurately, accurately represent or reflect

1476
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:47,520
that broader model that is described in that,

1477
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:49,520
the ISO standard in the text, right?

1478
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:52,520
Common logic is one implementation of it.

1479
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:53,520
It's a formal language.

1480
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:54,520
It's a fan.

1481
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:55,520
It's, I think it's actually Cliff,

1482
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:58,520
but it's a representative and one of among your family

1483
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:02,520
for first order logics that's used in computational reasoning.

1484
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:03,520
First order logic.

1485
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:07,520
This is a rather, a rather clearer, I would say,

1486
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:11,520
if I had to measure a clear representation of first order logic

1487
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:14,520
in this syntax, common logics, a little tough to parse,

1488
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:16,520
usually used for documentation.

1489
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:20,520
L-A-D-R, this is a less known syntax,

1490
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:22,520
the library for automated deduction research.

1491
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:24,520
This is used in model checking,

1492
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:26,520
in particular with MACE for improver nine,

1493
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:30,520
which Alan Ruttenberg had used to generate the consistency proof

1494
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:32,520
for the broader theory.

1495
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:34,520
Just, just pointing at these,

1496
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:38,520
you probably don't care that much unless you're a nerd about logic like I am,

1497
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:43,520
but what you're probably more interested in is this OWL file here.

1498
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:46,520
So, so this is what folks typically mean,

1499
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:48,520
or when they're talking about BFO in the wild,

1500
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:51,520
they want to, they want to focus on this specific file.

1501
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:54,520
So here, here's the updates, guys.

1502
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:56,520
Okay, okay, calm down.

1503
02:08:56,520 --> 02:08:57,520
I see you're too excited.

1504
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:58,520
Let's relax.

1505
02:08:58,520 --> 02:08:59,520
Okay, here's the updates.

1506
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:04,520
So over here, the BFO implementation in OWL,

1507
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:06,520
we're switching the name.

1508
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:07,520
It's the core file.

1509
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:10,520
Now BFO core OWL, and it,

1510
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:13,520
it's switched from the previous file name,

1511
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:15,520
which was not, wasn't the,

1512
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:19,520
wasn't the full, full gamut of temporal and space and time and all that,

1513
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:23,520
but it was called the BFO 2020 without some all times dot OWL file.

1514
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:27,520
And this was basically all the classes, all the relations, et cetera,

1515
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:33,520
but without the all and sometimes object properties.

1516
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:36,520
Okay, so this, you see here, this again,

1517
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:41,520
all the BFO classes in the 21A, or 21A38-2,

1518
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:46,520
and all the binary relations that do not require a third index for time.

1519
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:47,520
That's the important part.

1520
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,520
Okay.

1521
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:49,520
Why?

1522
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:51,520
To remain computationally tractable.

1523
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:55,520
OWL doesn't permit representing relations that hold between more than two things.

1524
02:09:55,520 --> 02:10:00,520
I assume you know that, but if not, blow in your mind, right?

1525
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:02,520
John is next to Sally, fine and OWL.

1526
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:05,520
John has armnet on Tuesday, not fine and OWL.

1527
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:06,520
We can't represent that.

1528
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:10,520
So representing time with only binary relations has been a persistent challenge

1529
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:13,520
for the ontology community in general.

1530
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:18,520
We have been working on this, on attempts to, to represent this information.

1531
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:24,520
One of those attempts was Allen's temporalized relations strategy.

1532
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:25,520
There are others.

1533
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:28,520
There's, for instance, the Common Quarantology Suite,

1534
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:32,520
and their team has developed an approach to this, this model,

1535
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:36,520
a set of modeling patterns that kind of revolves around Stacey's,

1536
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:40,520
which is like unchanging dependent continuance over time

1537
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:42,520
that are related to histories and whatnot.

1538
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:45,520
So here's some examples, temporalized relations,

1539
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:49,520
location of at all times, located in at all times, the inverse.

1540
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:52,520
You also have some times versions of these.

1541
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:56,520
On the other hand, Stacey's, you just kind of get to use the same object properties

1542
02:10:56,520 --> 02:10:58,520
that you would see in the relations ontology, for instance,

1543
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:03,520
location of and located in just with some more formal structure somewhere else

1544
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:05,520
in your design pattern.

1545
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:11,520
So temporalized relations, that strategy that was, that Allen developed,

1546
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:14,520
it provides a semantically rich representation of time

1547
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:17,520
and it does support sophisticated reasoning about time,

1548
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:20,520
but it's hard to use, real hard to use.

1549
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:24,520
Folks at a challenging time, like just, just trying to figure out when

1550
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:27,520
located in at all times holds versus located in at some times.

1551
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:30,520
And I can tell you, having worked in industry with folks,

1552
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:34,520
subject matter experts who would, you know, task to represent stuff

1553
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:37,520
with ontologies or like their domain with ontology,

1554
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:41,520
they would typically just defer to using the sometimes relation

1555
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:46,520
because it's the weakest and because they wouldn't know when all times held,

1556
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:49,520
like when is something a part of something else at all times,

1557
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:53,520
harder to say than when something is a part of something else at some times.

1558
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:56,520
The problem is sometimes is, is logically weak.

1559
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:58,520
It says almost nothing.

1560
02:11:58,520 --> 02:11:59,520
You don't get transitivity.

1561
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:01,520
You don't, you don't get much, right?

1562
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:03,520
It's just basically a tag.

1563
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:05,520
The stasis approach developed by CCO,

1564
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:09,520
it provides a semantically weak or weaker version of representation of time,

1565
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:13,520
but it is easier to deploy and there are fewer mistakes and users have another

1566
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:16,520
easier time understanding how to use it.

1567
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:21,520
This is not just motivated by like practical considerations of users,

1568
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:25,520
though, like sometimes some domains, I mean, domains do treat time differently.

1569
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:29,520
Economists treat time as discrete physicists that continuous and some don't

1570
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:31,520
even treat time at all.

1571
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:35,520
Not all domains need require semantically rich representations of time.

1572
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:38,520
Like a lot of folks in the logo foundry, for instance,

1573
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:42,520
use disease ontologies to just tag articles with terms and dates.

1574
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:45,520
They just do not need that kind of robot.

1575
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:49,520
I mean, maybe in an ideal world, if they were really using reasoning over,

1576
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:52,520
over these sorts of temporal structures, they, you know,

1577
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:55,520
they would need this kind of robust semantics, but they don't.

1578
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:56,520
They just kind of tack stuff.

1579
02:12:56,520 --> 02:13:00,520
So it's a lot, it's, it's a lot of work to get the time right.

1580
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:04,520
So they're not interested in doing that, especially for their specifically for

1581
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:05,520
their use cases.

1582
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:09,520
Now other, other foundries do need this corner representation of time.

1583
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:13,520
The industrial ontology foundry terms, they use temporalized relations.

1584
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:18,520
They need this semantic, this ability to reason more than just tagging data or

1585
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:20,520
date or terms and date times.

1586
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:23,520
They need that semantic structure that can run reasoners over when they're

1587
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:27,520
handling manufacturing and engineering content.

1588
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:28,520
Okay.

1589
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:33,520
So upshot here that temporalized relations strategy.

1590
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:38,520
The thing with the all times and the sometimes that was previously part of

1591
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:40,520
the approved version of BFO owl.

1592
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:45,520
So that was like, when you use, when you were in conformance with BFO,

1593
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:49,520
you were you, and you were using the owl file, you had to use that one.

1594
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:50,520
Again, tough.

1595
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:52,520
People used it incorrectly.

1596
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:53,520
Got a lot of pushback.

1597
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:56,520
We're taking a more flexible approach now.

1598
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:59,520
Now we are backing up a little and saying, depending on your use case,

1599
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:03,520
depending on your domain, you might need that not might not need that robust

1600
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:04,520
theory of time.

1601
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:08,520
You could also use Stacey's and potentially other extensions.

1602
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:12,520
We'll call them temporal extensions of the BFO core.

1603
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:17,520
But you are not necessarily required to use the temporalized relations version.

1604
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:20,520
You are required to use one of the extensions.

1605
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:24,520
Not just not, not a specific one.

1606
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:31,520
So roughly speaking, or broadly speaking, then the core implementation of BFO and owl

1607
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:36,520
is agnostic about representations of time that require more than binary relations.

1608
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:40,520
So as you see over here in the right hand side, this, this is, this is the core.

1609
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:42,520
These are the core relations.

1610
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:44,520
You see this in the BFO core file.

1611
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:47,520
They do not require reference to time.

1612
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:50,520
Some of them are temporal, but they don't require a third index.

1613
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:56,520
The temporal extensions of the core implementation of BFO, such as the temporalized relations

1614
02:14:56,520 --> 02:15:01,520
extension or the stasis extension, they provide representations of time which users can select

1615
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:03,520
based on, from based on their needs.

1616
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:04,520
So here are some examples.

1617
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:07,520
You should see the temporalized relations on the right.

1618
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:11,520
Aero pointing up is carry of it sometime carrier of it all times, et cetera.

1619
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:15,520
Same for Stacey's you have generically depends on has part has member.

1620
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:21,520
And again, the structure, the temporal structure there for Stacey's is it's, it's the semantics

1621
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:25,520
of some, it's weaker than the temporalized relations representation.

1622
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:28,520
There is additional structure for the Stacey's stuff.

1623
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:32,520
It's just not built into the object property, the way the temporalized relations is it's

1624
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:37,520
somewhere else is relying on like histories and this, this class called stasis.

1625
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:44,520
So temporal extensions of the BFO core, they will import BFO core owl and add relations

1626
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:49,520
for the purposes of representing relations holding at times and conformance to BFO now

1627
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:54,520
requires using that core, of course, which nobody has problem with, and at least one

1628
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:56,520
of those temporal extensions.

1629
02:15:56,520 --> 02:16:03,520
And then this is important because users deploying BFO can largely do so as they have.

1630
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:08,520
So if you are using temporalized relations continue, if you are not, if you are using

1631
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:15,520
something like RO, which CCO, the common core ontologies, which those are the developers

1632
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,520
stasis, they are, they use RO too.

1633
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:22,520
So if you are using those, and you are wanting to stay conformant with BFO, if you adopt

1634
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:28,520
what, what the CCO, what CCO is doing with those RO relations, you will also be in conformance

1635
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:33,520
with BFO, because you will in that way be adopting that temporal extension.

1636
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:40,520
So in addition, lastly, the BFO development team will create mappings across these extensions.

1637
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:46,520
So that is to say in this case between stasis and the temporalized relations, so that you

1638
02:16:46,520 --> 02:16:52,520
don't have drift of uses, like we don't want people like one group to use this temporalized

1639
02:16:52,520 --> 02:16:54,520
extension and another group to use another one.

1640
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:57,520
And then they go off and do their modeling, and then they're not interoperable.

1641
02:16:57,520 --> 02:17:02,520
So we're creating mappings between them so that it really is, you know, choose, choose

1642
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:07,520
your own adventure sort of situation and we'll, we'll map them together in the, in the back

1643
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:08,520
end.

1644
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:09,520
All right.

1645
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:15,520
So in summary, core BFO file taxonomy specified in 21, 8, 3, 8, 2, and relations that don't

1646
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:21,520
require temporal indexing extension, temporal extensions, import that core adding relations

1647
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:25,520
that provide richer representations of time, some more rich than others in the development

1648
02:17:25,520 --> 02:17:29,520
team will provide guidance for selecting the temporal extension based on need and will

1649
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:33,520
secure interoperability across extensions via mapping.

1650
02:17:33,520 --> 02:17:34,520
Look at that.

1651
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:40,520
I did it and I have what, seven minutes left.

1652
02:17:40,520 --> 02:17:42,520
Can you hear me, John?

1653
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:43,520
I can.

1654
02:17:43,520 --> 02:17:46,520
So you better explain what RO is.

1655
02:17:46,520 --> 02:17:49,520
Oh, I thought you already did it.

1656
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:50,520
It's the relations ontology.

1657
02:17:50,520 --> 02:17:56,520
So relations ontology is a large number of ontology or a large number of object properties

1658
02:17:56,520 --> 02:18:02,520
that are used very often used by oboe foundry ontologies.

1659
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:08,520
So they have things they include a lot of proper object properties like part of, but

1660
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:16,520
they also have some more specific object properties for biological phenomena like, I don't know

1661
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:21,520
what's a biology term, his titrate or something.

1662
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:22,520
What's that?

1663
02:18:22,520 --> 02:18:24,520
Spider's leg.

1664
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:25,520
Spider's leg.

1665
02:18:25,520 --> 02:18:26,520
Spider's leg.

1666
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:27,520
Spider's leg.

1667
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:28,520
Yeah.

1668
02:18:28,520 --> 02:18:36,520
Was there anything, any other clarifications?

1669
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:37,520
I ran through that quick.

1670
02:18:37,520 --> 02:18:45,520
I didn't want to get in the way of you and Pete.

1671
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:46,520
Yeah.

1672
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:47,520
Go ahead.

1673
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:52,520
I guess I need to control the audience.

1674
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:55,520
So we'll start over there.

1675
02:18:55,520 --> 02:18:59,520
Are you going to question if a new vehicle goes over the oboe foundry?

1676
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:04,520
Because you have seen a vehicle, too, and a written number of it.

1677
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:07,520
I think that's the one that you thought.

1678
02:19:07,520 --> 02:19:08,520
Shall I do that one?

1679
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:09,520
I couldn't hear him.

1680
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:10,520
So yeah.

1681
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:11,520
Okay.

1682
02:19:11,520 --> 02:19:17,520
So the question is, are we going to bring these goodies to the oboe foundry?

1683
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:19,520
Three wise men.

1684
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:22,520
I mean, you're going to try.

1685
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:23,520
I'm trying.

1686
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:25,520
I've been talking to Chris.

1687
02:19:25,520 --> 02:19:29,520
I was talking to Chris the other day, trying to, like, just, you know, finesse a little

1688
02:19:29,520 --> 02:19:30,520
bit.

1689
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:32,520
We got to go through the, we got to go through the process of like vetting.

1690
02:19:32,520 --> 02:19:33,520
Like that's his big thing.

1691
02:19:33,520 --> 02:19:34,520
And I understand.

1692
02:19:34,520 --> 02:19:35,520
So yeah.

1693
02:19:35,520 --> 02:19:41,520
Complete what John just describes convincingly and then take it to the other country.

1694
02:19:41,520 --> 02:19:46,520
So there are members of the oboe foundry who I would like the whole foundry to be running

1695
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:48,520
on both all the logic.

1696
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:51,520
And in the first of the logic, you don't have any problems.

1697
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:52,520
They all go away.

1698
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:59,520
And that in a way, that's my dream of.

1699
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:00,520
Yeah.

1700
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:03,520
Thank you for that clarification.

1701
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:09,520
What I do find a pity, however, is that in this new version, you have the so-called

1702
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:13,520
temporary relations because they are not temporary relations.

1703
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:19,520
They are, they're in labor only, but they cannot actually be admitted what you think

1704
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:21,520
you are representing.

1705
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:23,520
Because you need the temporal logic for that.

1706
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:26,520
It's a labor lane work allowance.

1707
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:29,520
That actually having a temporal logic.

1708
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:35,520
There are, it's a central extension to our, if you don't want to go to the group first

1709
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:41,520
or the logic for instance, there are alternatives to being almost to what the label actually

1710
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:42,520
would mean.

1711
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:43,520
So yeah.

1712
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:47,520
I find it disappointing to see that that actually made it in there.

1713
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:52,520
Are you to convert into a question?

1714
02:20:52,520 --> 02:21:01,520
Are you going to go to a powerful version that will be properly using a temporary logic

1715
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:06,520
so that you can do the actual reasoning with it and the consistency checking of what you

1716
02:21:06,520 --> 02:21:09,520
think you are representing?

1717
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:14,520
I mean, I think ultimately we have to, I share your dissatisfaction.

1718
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:19,520
I mean, the temporalized relations, any representation of time, you go look at it, you can, you know,

1719
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:22,520
you got the restrictions of hour so strong.

1720
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:26,520
I mean, almost anything interesting is a non-simple property.

1721
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:28,520
Like suddenly you can't say much.

1722
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:31,520
Like we say, hey, I'm representing the Allen interval calculus.

1723
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:32,520
No, you're not.

1724
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:33,520
Hush.

1725
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:34,520
Not an hour.

1726
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:35,520
She can't.

1727
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:41,520
So like, I totally understand the first order logic though, we have that intense logic or temporal logic.

1728
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:43,520
We could represent the sorts of structures.

1729
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:48,520
I think ultimately we're going to have to because ultimately I think that sort of temporal reasoning

1730
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:57,520
or sophisticated temporal reasoning that hasn't really been a set like within use cases of ontology

1731
02:21:57,520 --> 02:22:01,520
are becoming more and more necessary.

1732
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:06,520
Like the use cases that we're seeing now do want that kind of temporal reasoning.

1733
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:09,520
They do want that semantic rich representation.

1734
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:12,520
So we've been getting away for too long without it.

1735
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:15,520
We have to appeal to some more tools.

1736
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:18,520
So some folks have been working like Fabian.

1737
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:20,520
I'm not sure Fabian's here.

1738
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:34,520
Fabian has, Neuhaus has been developing some, some tools that are allow you kind of put kind of to put first order logic axioms on top of some owl axioms and, you know, generate a combine them,

1739
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:38,520
generate a model and prove some theorems using vampire in that setting.

1740
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:43,520
And then I think maybe there allows for a conversion back in the owl some to some extent.

1741
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:44,520
I'm not sure.

1742
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:46,520
So there's some research in that direction.

1743
02:22:46,520 --> 02:22:53,520
I myself have been trying to finesse shackle in combination with owl.

1744
02:22:53,520 --> 02:23:07,520
So using the expressivity of shackle with, you know, because it can also use sparkle with embedded within its shapes to try to maybe approach or get make some more progress towards representing temporal logic.

1745
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:09,520
Really just work in progress.

1746
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:12,520
I share your dissatisfaction is the answer.

1747
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:17,520
And I also share the need.

1748
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:24,520
One more.

1749
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:25,520
Okay.

1750
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:26,520
One minute.

1751
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:27,520
Come on guys.

1752
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:29,520
