0	8240	I'm going to talk about today is a survey of the ontology of mathematics.
8240	19040	I'm going to go through this quickly and so I'll go through the main options in the ontology of mathematics very quickly.
19040	24680	And then I am going to spend a little bit more time describing the option that Yorbsden and I are developing,
24680	27280	..which is not completely original..
27360	30800	..but it's original as applied to mathematics.
30880	33400	It's also original in the sense that it's still new.
33480	38600	Which means that we haven't, by any means, identified all the weak points.
38680	45040	And even the phrasing, in other words, the terminological choices..
45120	47920	..that we want to make in order to make our view clear..
48000	51160	..they're still somewhat uncertain.

167060	173060	Theoretic said that to believe that there are mathematical entities is just a mistake now
173060	178820	we can use mathematical symbols to do all kinds of wonderful things but those symbols don't
178820	185760	refer to anything and those who think they're referring to something are just making a mistake,
185760	190480	this mistake is a very useful mistake to make but it's a mistake.
190480	205200	followed by a related in the sense that there isn't really a festa mindist rather emotemical internetist is a logical system.
205200	219200	Lodgeth is not about anything to say that if p then p or q is not about anything, but it is a valid rule of logic.
219200	229200	Now what logitism says is that mathematics is a branch of logic, and therefore mathematics doesn't say anything, it's not about anything.
229200	237200	It gives you certain kinds of rules of inference. We'll say a little bit about that, but we're not going to take it very far.
237200	254200	That is the most mature view of mathematics, and the most thoroughly developed, but unfortunately it was also shown to be not workable at different levels.
254200	266200	Now another view, and again I'm not sure this has ever had any defenders in mathematics, but has had defenders in other areas like ethics.
266200	275200	It might be called anything that satisfies them, and the idea here is that if you have a complicated theory about ethics for instance,
275200	286200	and you don't know what norms or values or good or evil are, then you just present your theory as a collection of axioms,
286200	295200	and you say anything that satisfies these axioms is a norm or is a value. I don't know what those things are, and I don't care because I have my axioms.
295200	307200	That is a whole programme in philosophy called the camera programme, because it was invented and I think it's still defended by some people in camera.
308200	325200	Platonism, this is probably the oldest but not the most well-developed theory, says that there is a whole realm of mathematical entities which are abstract or atemporal outside our purview.
325200	343200	It's not part of the empirical world, and mathematics is about those entities, so mathematicians stare up into this platonic heaven and they decide how to write their axioms, and you do see some mathematicians staring up when they were.
343200	364200	The big problem with this is that we have to explain how it should be that truths about abstract entities in some transcended realm could be so useful when doing physics for instance, and that's the big problem in philosophy of mathematics, namely how do we explain the applicability for mathematics.
364200	376200	The final view, and our view will be a sub-view under this heading, although you'll taste the idea that we might be social constructionists. We are good social constructionists.
376200	393200	The final view says that mathematical entities are social constructions, and I will give you some examples of bad social constructionism, and then I hope you will be convinced that there is also good social constructionism, and then we will argue that mathematics is one example.
393200	398200	I think there's another option, that is the fictionalism.
398200	410200	Oh yes, you're right. Actually it was on my list, but somehow I did it. Fictionalism is a bit like the error theory. Fictionalism says that mathematical entities are like fictional entities.
410200	417200	In fact my very first publication defends of you like that, but in a good way.
417200	427200	Alright, so fictionalism is whenever I use a zoom in the university the internet breaks down.
428200	442200	So in order to avoid the consequences of that I'm going to record in the real world rather than in the zoom world.
442200	444200	I'm recording if you want.
444200	449200	You could record it. You are recording. I will record it anyway just for fun.
458200	461200	Ok, now.
465200	469200	Let me get rid of this with any luck.
469200	476200	It really likes to live things.
499200	502200	Are there any other questions while we're waiting?
515200	517200	Alright.
517200	522200	Can you say fiction is a kind of social construction?
522200	525200	No, because there's nothing constructed.
525200	532200	Well, I guess so, but that's not going to be an important question.
541200	551200	Logicism, as I say, says mathematics is a branch of logic, so if you could express all the theorems and axioms or all the theories of mathematics in logical terms,
551200	558200	then in principle you ought to be able to deduce all of those theorems or all of those axioms from the axioms of logic.
558200	570200	Frager and Russell both believed that this was possible and they both presented their accounts of how you could indeed infer large bodies of mathematics from logic.
571200	586200	In Frager's case, Russell showed that Frager's axioms were inconsistent in creating Russell's paradox, which he created just before Frager's main work was about to go to the press.
586200	605200	Frager was able to add a paragraph at the beginning forward in which he said that Mr Russell has suggested to me that there is some problem, but I believe that this problem can be addressed if you just add this extra wrinkle to some axiom.
605200	615200	That extra wrinkle did indeed work, but only in a universe which had exactly one object or some crazy restriction.
615200	634200	Russell published his own version, along with Whitehead, and he did a much better job in the sense that he was, as far as we can tell, consistent, but the job that he did was very, very complicated.
635200	646200	It was useful in the further development of logicism within the realm of set theory, but it was more complicated than the useful versions of that theory.
646200	658200	The useful versions of logicism say that not that all mathematics is a branch of logic, but that all mathematics can be expressed using set theory, the axioms of set theory.
659200	669200	A set theory is somewhat more powerful than logic as we understand it, and also set theory has problems with itself.
669200	678200	But I know recently there's a song chain called New Fragerism, so some guys may not be able to fix the problem.
678200	693200	These things come back. Anything that satisfies this and we've already mentioned, I've mentioned that Whitehead and Russell work in three volumes, it's called Wikipedia Mathematica.
693200	699200	It's an amazing piece of work, but as I say, it became outmoded.
699200	719200	A logicism, we've talked about. The next bit is taken from a talk I gave 20, maybe more years ago, hence the real old-fashioned design of my slides compared to the new ones, which are much more modern.
720200	735200	I deleted all the animation. This is just an extract, a few slides from this old talk, because economics is one area where social constructionism would seem to be a reasonable choice.
736200	750200	But Austrian economics adds a very important dimension to social constructionism, which I will try to explain very quickly, and then later on we'll see the relevance to mathematics.
750200	768200	Carl Mega was the founder of the Austrian School of Economics. He founded a school, some members of which were associated with Austrian philosophers such as Brentana, and so I published a book on the Austrian School of Philosophy, which contends treatments of Austrian economics.
768200	794200	I also published several papers on Austrian economics. The two running threads which joined together the Austrian economists and the Austrian philosophers are a kind of reverence for Aristotle on the one hand, and then a belief in a priorism on the other hand.
794200	814200	I will explain the a priorism in due course. Now, Mega had a reference for Aristotle in some of his terminology. He also had a reverence for things which were not Aristotelian in other parts of his writing, so Mega is not a simple programme for any kind of Aristotelian approach.
815200	835200	Now, what is economics for the Austrian School? So the economic domain domain includes things like buying and selling, valuing and pricing, putting a price on something and negotiating in many other things.
836200	858200	And if you take the state into account that includes things like taxing and includes banks in the account and includes things like interest rates, loans and so forth, so there are lots of constituent parts of the economic domain and the Austrian School says, well, let's work out what are the necessary dependence relations.
859200	876200	So in order for something to have a price, does it have to have a value? I don't know, but in order for something to have a value, the Austrians would say, it has to be such that someone values it, so there have to be things like preferences.
876200	891200	So we have a dependence relation between value and preference or between value and wanting. Now, this is a very simple example of what we're going to be calling an a priori law.
891200	906200	And what that means is that it's not a matter of logic. In other words, it's not purely empty. There is some content, some real content there. And it's something which is intelligible.
906200	920200	Anybody who understands what value is in the economic realm and what wanting or preferring is in the economic realm can see that value requires wanting or preferring.
920200	934200	This is called subjectivity in the Austrian School. The idea is that things have value only to the degree that the subjects in the relevant society are willing to pay or are willing to barter in order to own those things.
934200	947200	And there are many others such a priori dependence relations in the doctrine of the Austrian School, which become very, very sophisticated and have all kinds of implications.
948200	959200	I've given another one here. You can't have an exchange without having an exchanger and an exchange. You can't have a buying without having a selling and you can't have a selling without having a buying.
959200	971200	There are lots and lots of relations like this. Now, some of them may be analytic in the sense that they are just a matter of definition.
971200	989200	But you see, if we take buying and selling, it can't be that both buying and selling are definable in such a way that it becomes analytic that buying requires selling and selling because of buying.
989200	1003200	You have to start either with buying or with selling. You can define selling in terms of buying, but then you have to accept buying and the features of buying as being something which is not analytic.
1003200	1008200	And I'll talk a little bit about that as we go along.
1008200	1029200	This is an example of the kind of analysis that Menga created. For him, a good exists only if there is a need. A good implies value and value exists only if there is some kind of a need, whether this be a basic need or whether it's a need of the moment.
1029200	1040200	For instance, when you see that some film is playing in a cinema and you feel a need to go and see that film, that's not a basic need, but it is a need in the sense of Menga.
1040200	1044200	A basic need would be the need for food or something.
1045200	1066200	The object has to be searched and you can satisfy that need. There has to be knowledge, so good exists only where there is knowledge. Knowledge of needs and knowledge of causal connections and not necessarily on your part, there could be causal connections on the part of the seller.
1066200	1077200	And a command over the thing so you have the money to buy it. Somebody has a copy to sell.
1077200	1091200	Now, this a priorism as the Austrian school is defended in Menga, but it's defended in a more radical way in Mises, Ludwig von Mises, who was a famous Austrian economist.
1092200	1105200	First half of the 20th century, with a large school of followers, and he says, and he was influenced by Kant, which may explain why he gets things wrong.
1105200	1115200	He said that there is only one axiom and that all the other axioms are economic to follow from this one axiom, and the axiom is man and act.
1115200	1126200	This is the axiom of action. If we understand action, he says, then we understand need, value and all the other things, analytics. They all follow from this one axiom.
1126200	1139200	And then two of his followers, one from Murray Rothbard. Rothbard, in fact, reviewed the books that I wrote on the Austrian school very friendly.
1140200	1158200	And Hermann Hoppe, he's a German, which is not necessarily a bad thing, who wrote a very nice book, which I like defending sovereignty. It's called something like The Mistake, which is democracy.
1159200	1165200	And I like some of the thinking of Hoppe.
1165200	1180200	All right, now, so we've already mentioned many of the terms that we're going to need, so something is analytic if it's a truth of logic, and we're talking about truths or propositions or judgments or statements.
1181200	1190200	A truth is synthetic, if it adds to your knowledge, it's not analytic in other words.
1190200	1198200	Truth is a priori, if it's known independently of experience, which means it's intrinsically intelligible in some way.
1198200	1206200	And a posteriori just means known via experience, and that is the answer.
1207200	1214200	You could have picked a better photo for sure.
1214200	1219200	Absolutely, I did, but he must have looked like it.
1219200	1222200	I mean, there are better pictures of it.
1222200	1225200	As an a priori.
1225200	1234200	So, Kant had the theory of the synthetic a priori, but he thought that he only held for physics.
1234200	1243200	We have synthetic a priori knowledge about time, space, and causality, and that knowledge is called Newtonian mechanics.
1243200	1254200	He thought we knew that a priori, and maybe he's right, but the point I'm going to be making in what follows is that there are many, many other areas
1254200	1261200	that are such that we have a priori knowledge, seemingly, which Kant did not address.
1261200	1271200	So, Kant may have got some aspects of the synthetic a priori right, but he certainly didn't get the scope right.
1271200	1276200	All right, so I just said that.
1276200	1286200	Now, I don't want to talk too much about visas on mega, these are just illustrations.
1286200	1296200	This is more important, so this shows the Aristotelian basis of mega's views, and general essence and general connection,
1296200	1307200	they are the two key components of our view of mathematics and physics, actually, when we get to it.
1307200	1312200	So, in German, that would be Wiesen, and Wiesen's Zusammenhang.
1312200	1320200	Now, general essence and general, and the general connection of economic phenomena, they sound okay in a sentence like this,
1320200	1333200	but if you try and write about general essence in a paper published in an analytic philosophy journal, which is the only type of philosophical journal which we're publishing in,
1333200	1339200	then people will just turn up their noses and say this is something old fashioned, so that's our problem.
1339200	1347200	So, we would like to call the synthetic a priori truths, which we are studying, basis of Zusammenhang.
1347200	1352200	General connections of essences, but we can't because it's German.
1352200	1355200	So, I want to stick with the synthetic a priori truth.
1355200	1364200	Because we're not talking about truth anymore, we're talking about things on the side of the mathematical or realm of physics.
1365200	1367200	Can you call the postulates instead of truths?
1367200	1373200	That's the same problem. So, postulates are on the side of truths. We want to talk about what is on the side of objects.
1373200	1382200	We want to say that there are essences and essential connections on the side of the objects in themselves, or objects themselves.
1382200	1386200	And that this is so in mathematics as well as in physics.
1386200	1397200	In mathematics, if anything, even more obviously the case, but in mathematics, the tendency to see things as being analytic is very strong because of logic.
1401200	1405200	So, this is another word for it, non-inductive intelligible structures.
1405200	1415200	Now, we know that every human is born virtually with the capabilities to apprehend, recognise non-inductive intelligible structures.
1415200	1421200	Differences between colours, for instance, can't be learned. Differences between shapes can't be learned.
1421200	1427200	Differences between feeling good and feeling bad can't be learned.
1427200	1433200	And grasp those things innately. They are intrinsically intelligent.
1433200	1443200	And as we get older, more and more of these intrinsically intelligible structures become evident to us.
1443200	1447200	So, as a result of the fact that we also learn a lot of things very quickly.
1447200	1455200	Okay, this is Adolf Reiner, who has a much more, much straighter face than that should be.
1455200	1460200	He was a philosopher of law, who was also a student of Hussal.
1460200	1469200	And in 1913 he published a book, Length Monograph, on the a priori foundations of the civil law.
1469200	1473200	And it's that which is our model for mathematics.
1473200	1477200	We want to do the ontology of mathematics based on this Reinachian approach.
1477200	1488200	And I have a lot of slides now about Reinach, but I'll go through them very quickly, so don't be disturbed by the fact that I'm going through them very quickly, because we don't need them most of the time.
1488200	1493200	Let me say a little bit more about Reinach, just for interest sake.
1493200	1500200	So, Reinach was sometimes referred to by Hussal's followers, so Reinach was a follower of Hussal.
1500200	1505200	Hussal founded a school, but there was a group of Hussal's followers in Munich.
1505200	1509200	And Hussal was in Göttingen, and then in Freiburg, he was not in Munich.
1509200	1514200	So, the Munich School of Phenomenology is a kind of separate wing.
1515200	1526200	And they were accused by Hussal of practicing what he later on, when he became critical of some of the Munich School work, of practicing picture book phenomena.
1526200	1540200	What that means is they would take a domain like aesthetics or chemistry or ethics or the will, and they would draw phenomenological pictures, diagrams effectively, although they didn't use diagrams,
1540200	1545200	but they were thinking in a way in which you could capture very well diagrammatically.
1545200	1552200	That's why I like them, incidentally. I like diagrammatically the representations of philosophical views.
1552200	1555200	That's why I became an ontologist.
1555200	1569200	So, Reinach was almost certainly the cleverest of these people, and he was referred by other people later on, even when he moved to Göttingen to be in the same town,
1569200	1574200	in the same university, and he was referred to as the phenomenologists.
1574200	1579200	Because you should go to him if you wanted to know about phenomenology, not to Hussal.
1579200	1582200	He was a much better teacher.
1582200	1587200	Now, another person who was in Göttingen is Edith Stein.
1587200	1591200	And I ought to see if you all know who Edith Stein is.
1591200	1593200	Edith Stein.
1593200	1599200	So, she was Hussal's assistant during this period.
1599200	1604200	She helped Hussal write at least one of his books.
1604200	1610200	Hussal obviously couldn't give her a job because she was a woman.
1610200	1617200	But she was Jewish, but she converted to Christianity.
1617200	1621200	But she was sent to a concentration camp.
1621200	1630200	Her life was a model of singiness, and so, after she died, they made her a saint.
1630200	1636200	So, the Munich school had at least one saint as a member.
1636200	1644200	But actually, it had two, because another member of the Munich school, who was also a friend of Edith Stein and Reinach,
1645200	1659200	was a Polish philosopher called Roman Ingaarden, who applied the Munich phenomenological method to works of art, literature, architecture, music, and so forth, among other things.
1659200	1670200	And one of Ingaarden's friends in Poland, when he went back to Poland, became the Pope, the Polish Pope, who was now a saint.
1670200	1681200	And the Polish Pope was a professor of philosophy, and he was focusing on Thomas Aquinas and Max Schela.
1681200	1697200	Max Schela is another member of the Munich school who applied the phenomenological method, in his case, to everything under the sun from aristocracy to war, to the greatness of Germany and the impoverishedness of the grocery in England and so on.
1697200	1706200	So, Schela was fantastically all-encompassing, but his book on his ethics is also fantastic.
1706200	1718200	All right, so this work, like the Speech Act theory of Austen and Stealth, starts out with a promise.
1718200	1730200	The promise is a phenomenon which we're all familiar with and which is obeying a priori look, just like buying and selling.
1730200	1737200	In fact, it's related to buying and selling because there are some promise aspects involved in many economic transactions.
1737200	1741200	Contracts are promises.
1741200	1751200	And now, this is a very good source book about Reina and the whole Munich school.
1751200	1755200	Okay, I'll come back to Reina in a minute. Let me just talk about social constructionism.
1755200	1763200	First of all, it's a big bad, ugly vegetable garden with different kinds of views.
1763200	1768200	A very illustrative account of this big bad vegetable garden is by Ian Hacking.
1768200	1772200	It's called the social construction of what.
1772200	1780200	And some of the examples he deals with in that book are facts, gender, quarks, madness, reality and so on.
1780200	1787200	So, the idea that madness is socially constructed would turn on the fact that particular terms like hysteria,
1787200	1793200	which were very common in the Victorian times but which are now completely not used,
1793200	1800200	would suggest that what those particular terms referred to was a worse social construction.
1800200	1805200	That's the kind of idea, always a historical idea in Hacking,
1805200	1814200	that Hacking uses to characterise, identify social constructions.
1814200	1821200	All right, now, I'm going to talk a little bit about In-Garden
1821200	1832200	because this will give us a clone to the complexity that can be found on the side of socially constructed entities.
1832200	1837200	Now, the whole world of works of art is clearly socially constructed.
1837200	1843200	There are clearly different tastes at different times in the history of art,
1843200	1850200	which makes certain things beautiful to one generation that would not necessarily be beautiful to another generation.
1850200	1860200	Now, In-Garden's approach to unpacking the ontological structure of a work of art is in terms of what he calls strata.
1860200	1870200	So, a work of art for In-Garden has strata which we need to apprehend in order to apprehend the work as a whole,
1870200	1872200	but we apprehend them as a unity.
1872200	1877200	This is a work of literature. We have phonetic formations.
1877200	1889200	In other words, when we read a poem or a novel, then we read in such a way that we read the words as being spoken with a given accent.
1889200	1895200	For instance, if we read a novel in which there is a German or a Russian character,
1895200	1904200	we may hear the German or the Russian accent, but in any case, there are sounds afoot in the literary work.
1904200	1912200	If you don't have any sound associations when you read a work, then you're not getting the full body of the work as an aesthetic object.
1912200	1918200	Then there are meanings, simple meanings and complex meanings of all the sentences and paragraphs and so on.
1918200	1922200	Then there are what In-Garden calls schematised aspects.
1922200	1929200	So, we are presented with the hero as having long black hair, but we're not presented.
1929200	1936200	We don't know how long, and we don't know whether it's genuinely black or whether it's dyed, so that it's schematised aspects.
1936200	1946200	That means that we don't know everything. We only know certain things, a finite number of things about the places and people and actions presented in the work.
1947200	1956200	Then there are those places and people and actions and states of affairs which are presented in the work, and they form a stratum in and of themselves.
1956200	1965200	In some cases, there will be value qualities and metaphysical qualities which you apprehend when you read it.
1965200	1972200	The In-Garden has a very complicated account of what it is to read a literary work.
1973200	1980200	What the work is depends also upon the readings that take place.
1980200	1988200	He has a theory of the literary work of art as being a product of human intentions.
1988200	1991200	Now, that's a kind of social construction.
1991200	2001200	So, if you just throw a lot of ink on paper and it comes out with words, to be words, by whatever means,
2001200	2009200	but no, it's never sold, it's never given to anybody as a novel, then it does not exist as a literary work.
2009200	2012200	A literary work exists only if there is a readership.
2012200	2019200	Now, it may be that no one reads it anymore, but still it exists because there was once a readership.
2019200	2027200	So, it's a social construction because the readership is a social entity.
2027200	2031200	And the author is relatively insignificant.
2031200	2037200	So, the author doesn't decide what the meanings are or what the schematised aspects are.
2037200	2043200	I accept, insofar as he gives all the clues that you can ever get when he writes the novel.
2043200	2047200	It's the readers who make those decisions.
2047200	2053200	Clearly, they'll be guided by what the author says, and they will share lots of assumptions that the author shares,
2053200	2056200	but they may also have different assumptions.
2056200	2060200	All right, so, an example, well, now I won't do the next one.
2060200	2065200	Now, music has only two aspects, or in some cases only one.
2065200	2071200	So, we're talking now about, not about opera, but about synthesis of one second.
2071200	2080200	And some works of music have value qualities, they have a kind of metaphysical quality about them.
2080200	2085200	But, basically, what music is characterised by, and here is an error,
2085200	2092200	is not by words sounds as it says here, but by sound.
2092200	2099200	So, the work of music is a sound formation, a big one.
2102200	2104200	Yes, Carmella.
2104200	2109200	Are readers or audiences co-agents?
2109200	2113200	It comes down to that, yes.
2113200	2119200	It's not symmetry.
2119200	2127200	So, basically, in Garden has a view according to which the work of art has a life.
2127200	2134200	It's born when the author pushes the manuscript on the publisher's desk, or a bit later than that,
2134200	2141200	and it dies when the planet is annihilated or everyone stops reading it.
2141200	2146200	And during that time, the readers determine what the significance, meaning, the sounds even.
2146200	2152200	So, Shakespeare, we hear now, if it's performed today, may be in a kind of old-fashioned English.
2152200	2159200	But still, it's English, where in Shakespeare's day, the accent that people spoke in England
2159200	2165200	was a combination of what is today Yorkshire and Danish.
2165200	2168200	And that's quite different from what the way we hear Shakespeare now,
2168200	2175200	and that means that Shakespeare's plays have, in their life, evolved to be different today
2175200	2181200	from what they were in the olden days that Mark created.
2181200	2183200	And the examples come from set theory.
2183200	2190200	The best example of autonomous mathematical objects, I say, are the numbers.
2190200	2197200	And so, the German mathematician Chronica had a saying, which has been repeated many times,
2197200	2203200	God made the natural numbers. All the rest is the work of man.
2203200	2207200	So, I'm defending the... something like the Chronica theory.
2207200	2214200	And then, the second paper I published was on the same topic, actually, I was already boring.
2214200	2222200	So, I just went into more details about the historical aspect of mathematics,
2222200	2229200	although I didn't really say any of the things that Jobs and I want to say now about the history of mathematics,
2229200	2234200	because I was working with a rather narrowly constrained phenomenological framework.
2234200	2240200	I was working to find a way of applying Ingarth's ideas to mathematical entities.
2240200	2246200	And then, the third paper I will mention, all of this is within the 1970s.
2246200	2253200	These were the... I think this was not the third paper I published.
2253200	2263200	This paper is about this relation between representations on the one hand and the real world now.
2264200	2270200	And so, there is this picture. It was really published.
2270200	2276200	It didn't force me to make a real print quality graphic, unfortunately.
2276200	2282200	So, that's the real world down there, and the real world, of course, includes consciousness.
2282200	2286200	And the graphic doesn't even capture that very well.
2286200	2291200	And because there is consciousness, there are all kinds of targets of intentionality.
2292200	2299200	Now, some of these targets of intentionality, which are in the inner suburbs, if you like, might exist.
2299200	2309200	So, for instance, the snow-smoking zone in a restaurant that's socially constructed, if it really exists,
2309200	2314200	Poland really exists, that's socially constructed.
2314200	2322200	But some of the things in the outer suburbs are dependent for their ontological status exclusively upon consciousness.
2322200	2327200	And examples would be fictional characters.
2327200	2330200	Now, the question is where mathematics goes.
2330200	2338200	In the earlier papers, I had an argument for the role for two kinds of mathematical entities.
2339200	2345200	But this is about all the different kinds of entities that we can be directed towards in our mental experience.
2345200	2351200	Some of them are autonomous, some of them are intentional, but they really exist, like Poland,
2351200	2353200	and some of them are purely intentional.
2353200	2360200	So, they can be targets, but they don't exist in any sense, such as Hamlet in play,
2360200	2365200	or better Sherlock Holmes in the novel.
2365200	2372200	Now, this is a slightly richer diagram, so it's a better diagram.
2372200	2382200	So, the inner suburbs now are counted as parts of the real world, but the parts of it here are still dependent upon consciousness.
2382200	2391200	And these are intentional, so the rocks and the planets are autonomous, but everything above the line is intentional.
2392200	2398200	And the outer suburbs then are fictional, basically.
2398200	2405200	Now, how many people have heard of intuitionism as a philosophy of mathematics?
2405200	2407200	A couple of you, three.
2407200	2417200	So, intuitionism is one of the classic positions that people developed in the philosophy of mathematics.
2417200	2424200	After the failure of Frege, people wanted a more grounded foundation for mathematics.
2424200	2426200	They wanted to have certainty.
2426200	2430200	Frege thought he had certainty, but the whole thing plopped.
2430200	2439200	Frege is fantastic, his contributions are fantastic, but his account of logicism was a failure,
2439200	2442200	and therefore his account of mathematics is a failure.
2442200	2453200	Brower and Heiting developed their own peculiar way of shoring up the safety of mathematical claims,
2453200	2462200	and the way he said, we can only believe in mathematical objects if we've constructed them in a construction,
2462200	2469200	and a construction is a kind of proof, so you can construct numbers by counting to them.
2469200	2477200	There were some extreme followers of this kind of view who said that since we can't count to, let's say, 600 billion,
2477200	2480200	600 billion is already infinite.
2480200	2487200	They were called finitists, and the leader of the finitist movement is now dead, I assume.
2487200	2493200	This was called Yes it involved it, and maybe there were no other members.
2493200	2503200	Brower and Heiting were much better than finitism, so they developed a version of calculus on intuitionist lines.
2503200	2514200	The main way of understanding intuitionism is to find out that it implies that we cannot believe in the law of excluded middle.
2514200	2528200	The law of excluded middle says that if you've proved that not P, then you can infer that P, and that fails for intuitionism,
2528200	2539200	because you might have a constructed proof that not P, but no constructed proof that P, and you can only assert P when you have a constructed proof.
2539200	2550200	This is a very interesting idea, so some of you will know that I studied with Michael Dummit in Oxford,
2550200	2558200	and I attended a whole terms worth of lectures by Dummit on the intuitionistic calculus,
2558200	2563200	which is like doing calculus with one hand tied behind your back,
2563200	2569200	but you learn a lot if you have to do calculus without using the law of excluded middle.
2569200	2577200	Now, but it died, basically. There are very few people who believe in intuitionism as a movement anymore,
2577200	2585200	but it became a settled part of what you might call the lattice of mathematical options.
2586200	2597200	If you regard a mathematical theory, so I say lattice, I could say Boolean algebra,
2597200	2603200	I suppose we have each approach to mathematics, sees mathematics as a Boolean algebra,
2603200	2611200	then you can see the intuitionistic mathematics as a special kind of Boolean algebra, a weaker Boolean algebra,
2611200	2620200	and to be precise, it's a relatively pseudo-complemented pseudo-Boolean algebra.
2620200	2627200	Pseudo-complemented means that if you know A and you know not A,
2627200	2631200	then you don't know that you've filled the whole space of options.
2631200	2640200	That's not quite right, but anyway, I won't say any more, you can work it out for yourself.
2640200	2648200	All right, so this paper I published, this is chronic, my example were Cantor set theory,
2648200	2654200	and then there are transfinite cardinals. So Cantor set theory is a theory of sets, it works very well for.
2654200	2659200	Finite sets, people show that it works very well for infinite sets,
2659200	2669200	but now you get a lot of freedom in creating more and more types of really, really big infinite sets.
2670200	2678200	Clearly, there are different paths you can take in building bigger and bigger infinite sets,
2678200	2684200	and it seemed to me intuitive that some of those paths might be leading to truth,
2684200	2689200	but at least some of them, and you could make a fake one if necessary,
2689200	2692200	at least some of them are not leading to truth.
2692200	2699200	So transfinite cardinals of this sort, just a very messy sort,
2699200	2705200	but one clue whether a particular branch of set theory is useful, or is real,
2705200	2712200	it's about real things, is whether it's useful, and some transfinite set theories are useful
2712200	2719200	for physics or in some other economic field, and so they probably are about real mathematical sets,
2719200	2724200	some of them are not useful, and they might be good candidates for being fictional,
2724200	2727200	so it's beautiful fictional mathematics.
2729200	2736200	All right, now the next topic we have to deal with is structuralism.
2736200	2743200	So if we want to say that pi is a socially constructed entity,
2743200	2746200	we still have to say what kind of entity it is.
2746200	2752200	Here the plate in his view is still embraced by many people,
2752200	2756200	including by many mathematicians consciously or not,
2756200	2763200	but another view which is embraced explicitly in a number of very influential publications is structuralism,
2763200	2767200	and this says that mathematical entities are structures,
2767200	2773200	and the locus classicus of this view, which is also the first paper I read in the philosophy of mathematics
2773200	2777200	when I started studying philosophy of mathematics in Oxford,
2777200	2782200	is that by a man called Benasirath, this is a classic of the philosophy of mathematics,
2782200	2788200	and his idea is you take Russell's theory of what numbers are,
2788200	2793200	and you take, I think this is Cantor's theory of what numbers are,
2793200	2800200	and so three is the set consisting of zero, one, two, and so forth,
2800200	2804200	and you get two logically incompatible accounts of what numbers are,
2804200	2811200	both of which have perfectly good application, there's no difference in the degree to which they're useful.
2811200	2816200	There are many other accounts of what numbers are, you could generate your own theory,
2816200	2822200	and so Benasirath concluded that numbers are none of these things,
2822200	2829200	rather we have a certain structure which we could call the number structure,
2829200	2834200	and this number structure is exemplified here and there,
2834200	2838200	and in all of the other various candidate accounts of what numbers are.
2838200	2849200	So numbers are nodes in structures, and they are probably themselves structures.
2849200	2853200	Everything is a structure from the point of view of structuralism.
2853200	2863200	Now, we, Ylfynai Embrace, structuralism, but we do not hold that all of mathematics are structures,
2863200	2869200	we think that would be, that would be turtles all the way down,
2869200	2879200	and so we want to have some basis, some vision, some essence upon which the vision is examining
2879200	2885200	at the combinations of vision which are represented standardly and set theory terms could rest,
2885200	2893200	and so our resting places are going to be zero, one, and maybe the line or the point,
2893200	2897200	and various other unitary things, so non-structures,
2897200	2902200	which will be the basic elements out of which the structures are built.
2902200	2908200	So we're not classical structuralists, we are structuralists with bottom.
2909200	2910200	All right.
2911200	2913200	I think Noah has a question.
2913200	2914200	Yes.
2914200	2917200	So are natural numbers standard in the grounding?
2917200	2921200	No, just zero and one, because once you've got zero and one,
2921200	2926200	you can get all the others, basically by adding one, and adding one again.
2926200	2929200	Zero and one, and what else?
2929200	2931200	Well, we don't know.
2931200	2937200	We almost certainly will never know everything about what constitutes the bottom.
2938200	2943200	I know things that you can do it with just zero and one, but I'm fighting.
2943200	2945200	Why wouldn't you be able to?
2945200	2949200	I just have this feeling in my phone.
2949200	2952200	How do we get the circle?
2952200	2954200	What is stopping us?
2954200	2960200	Is there any errors that we face when we just go down to zero and one?
2960200	2966200	We need to be able to construct the circle, and it's hard to see how you do that from zero and one.
2966200	2967200	Yes.
2967200	2970200	Can we say on empty side is a circle structure?
2970200	2971200	A what?
2971200	2972200	Empty side.
2972200	2974200	Is empty side a structure?
2974200	2975200	I can't hear it.
2975200	2976200	Empty set a structure?
2976200	2977200	Empty set.
2977200	2978200	Yeah.
2978200	2986200	When York talks about these things, he identifies zero, empty set, and the null operator.
2986200	2987200	He thinks they're all the same.
2987200	2995200	And then he has one, the set, which you can say is the empty set as its only member.
2995200	3000200	And the progressive operator.
3000200	3003200	Yeah, you had it on a different side, yeah.
3003200	3004200	Yes?
3004200	3006200	Zero and one are...
3006200	3009200	If they're doing a ground name, where do they exist?
3011200	3014200	So, that's a very good question.
3014200	3015200	I would...
3015200	3017200	What if I exist?
3017200	3020200	So, zero and one are going to have to be created.
3020200	3023200	They're going to have to be socially constructed.
3024200	3027200	So, there are two kinds of mathematical entities.
3027200	3034200	Those which are socially constructed are the initial, in other words, as part of the ground.
3034200	3047200	And those which are socially constructed with the help of one or other structural combinatoric relations.
3047200	3053200	And part of our ontology mathematics includes structure-generating relations, like set-all.
3053200	3062200	And the idea, the historical idea, would be that they'd discover pi, and then they'd discover...
3062200	3073200	Or, roughly at the same time, they'd discover all of the geometrical relations that you can construct with compass and ruler.
3073200	3079200	But first, they'd discover how to construct those things, but they didn't do it in the right order.
3079200	3086200	So, they discovered pi before they knew of anything about irrational numbers or about sets.
3086200	3092200	But if you reimagine the history of mathematics so that things are discovered in the right order,
3092200	3099200	then you get a chain from the very, very simple mathematics to the more complicated.
3099200	3109200	And then our basic theory says that the principle driver in creating more and more complicated mathematics is physics.
3109200	3119200	So, as physics develops, engineering develops, people's inventions develop, they need more and more complicated mathematics.
3119200	3127200	That forces the development of more and more complicated forms of mathematics, and thereby mathematics then continues to develop.
3127200	3131200	And that's what's happened since about Galileo's time.
3131200	3142200	There's no worry about a structure-generating and apocalyptic event where enough of us die, and the only remaining people are like the Amazonian tribes.
3142200	3146200	And do you really want to say those numbers are out of existence?
3146200	3152200	Yes, so I'm afraid I don't have any choice.
3152200	3155200	I don't want to say it, but I think it seems like...
3155200	3159200	What are the chances of aliens being...
3159200	3163200	So, as long as there are records left...
3163200	3167200	I mean, we need to leave it like that.
3167200	3170200	Can you imagine another planet away from here?
3170200	3173200	Yes, so that is a problem.
3173200	3176200	So, let's go through your possible scenario.
3176200	3182200	So, one scenario is that all records and all civilisation is destroyed on Earth,
3182200	3186200	but there are tribes who survived after a few generations.
3186200	3190200	They recreate mathematics, but they do it differently in whatever way.
3190200	3196200	Maybe they do it inconsistently with what we did, but maybe they repeat.
3196200	3202200	So, they invent part. Is it the same mathematical entity, or is it a different one?
3202200	3208200	If you're a Platonist, the answer to that question is easy, if you're a social constructionist as well.
3209200	3214200	I don't know if I'm just one of those questions for which I have no answer.
3214200	3221200	Now, exactly the same case would be if, on Mars, they did the Martian's Development and Mathematics,
3221200	3225200	which happened to discover part, would it be the same?
3225200	3231200	The temptation is to say it would be the same, but that's because Platonism is always the temptation.
3231200	3233200	Yes?
3233200	3238200	So, is it not necessary that pie will be different?
3238200	3242200	No, it's not necessary at all.
3242200	3249200	For many thousands of years of existence of human beings, they didn't discover part.
3249200	3251200	It took time.
3251200	3256200	We see it as being rather trivial, but it wasn't quite complicated to reach that point.
3256200	3262200	It's complicated to reach the point where you could recognise that a hypotenuse on the right angle of triangle
3262200	3269200	is not necessarily going to be measurable for the real number.
3269200	3271200	Yes?
3271200	3276200	So, now, zero, one, pie are constructed.
3276200	3284200	No, zero and one are ground stones, they're foundations then. Pie is constructed.
3284200	3287200	Wait, they're ground stones, but didn't we also create it?
3287200	3290200	Yes, we'll have to lay the foundations ourselves.
3290200	3292200	Yes, so create it.
3292200	3297200	But are there a priori los where nothing is constructed?
3297200	3310200	So, once we create certain mathematical entities, then certain intelligible truths are forced upon us, really.
3310200	3315200	It's not that we create them, it's that we're forced upon us.
3315200	3320200	And now, this is always complicated at the time that the things didn't happen in the right order,
3320200	3328200	but the people who invented pie knew very well as a matter of a priori truth that pie is the ratio
3328200	3332200	between the circumference and the diameter of the circle, because that's how they discovered it.
3332200	3336200	That's what it was meant to be, so that's almost one of it.
3336200	3344200	But then they discovered various other relations involving pie, and they proved to themselves,
3344200	3351200	using the Ythelian methods that those relations hold universally for all circles,
3351200	3359200	and that means that they had more a priori truths and a priori knowledge about pie
3359200	3363200	as the geometry, geometric understanding developed.
3363200	3366200	So, we don't make the syndeticate priori, all right?
3366200	3371200	Truths, we discover them after we've made the objects which they're about.
3371200	3377200	And this, when I get to the law, this will become clear. Anyone?
3377200	3385200	All right, so this structuralist that I recommend that you read is Scott, Stu Shapiro in Ohio.
3385200	3395200	There is a Stu Shapiro in Buffalo. I have to make it clear which Stu Shapiro I am referring to.
3395200	3407200	So, I think he's right about the first two, but that he's wrong when he says just here.
3407200	3410200	For him, it is structures all the way.
3410200	3414200	All right, so now we're going to develop Ryanachian structuralism,
3414200	3419200	and we're going to start off where Ryanach started, which is in the ontology of law.
3419200	3427200	And as I said, he invented in 1913 much of the act, but it is simultaneously a speech act.
3427200	3432200	So, it's not that you have a mental act which you could formulate in words,
3432200	3438200	a mental act which is formulated in words, and in the case of the promise, it has to be formulated in words.
3439200	3445200	Visa vi, the promisee, so the promisee has to register that you have made a promise,
3445200	3447200	otherwise you haven't made a promise.
3447200	3452200	And all of that is a priorite, a synthetic a priorite.
3452200	3454200	And Ryanach recognized that.
3454200	3465200	So, and Austin had glimpses of that, but they didn't want to embrace the doctrine that there is a synthetic a priorite truth.
3465200	3471200	So, Ryanach is indeed a synthetic a priorite structure, which is what Ryanach is all about.
3471200	3476200	Ryanach is about the synthetic a priorite structures realized in these sorts of cases,
3476200	3482200	and also in many other sorts of cases which go to form the law.
3482200	3492200	So, he developed a whole ontology of social reality, which he expressed in terms of the collective imposition of function.
3492200	3499200	He is a president, which is a physical thing, but we imposed upon the president the function of ruling the country.
3499200	3502200	That was a collective imposition of function.
3502200	3506200	And so, that is the theory of everything in social reality.
3506200	3509200	It's always a matter of collective imposition of function.
3509200	3511200	And so, we can do it on objects.
3511200	3517200	So, we can do it with cathedrals, we can do it with driver's licenses, we can do it with dollar bills.
3517200	3523200	And this is all captured in this slogan or formula.
3523200	3531200	So, a cathedral, about building counts as a cathedral in context, if there is a bishop and so on.
3531200	3539200	So, this human being counts as a president because we have collected the imposition of function upon this.
3539200	3541200	And this doesn't work.
3541200	3545200	So, I am one of the few people who showed Searle that he was wrong.
3545200	3548200	So, he printed a correction.
3548200	3556200	It doesn't work as a general theory of social entities because a debt is a social entity.
3556200	3561200	But there is nothing upon which we collectively impose a function.
3561200	3572200	If you write IOU on such and such, then the debt note is fitting with Searle's formula.
3572200	3580200	But if I just say I promise to give Ali a hundred dollars tomorrow,
3580200	3590200	I should let's say 18,000 dollars a year in six months, which is not actually the end.
3590200	3594200	I signed paperwork, or I will be signing paperwork.
3594200	3601200	The other person who has to release the money has not signed yet.
3601200	3605200	So, I just promise to Ali.
3605200	3609200	And therefore, I have an obligation to Ali.
3609200	3615200	But my obligation is not a piece of reality, a piece of stone or plastic,
3615200	3618200	organic material upon which I impose a function.
3618200	3621200	So, Searle is wrong and he abandoned this formula.
3621200	3625200	He said he never meant it here.
3625200	3631200	He abandoned this formula because of what I call freestanding y terms.
3631200	3634200	So, x counters y.
3634200	3638200	There are some x's which are social entities for which there is no y.
3638200	3643200	Sorry, y counters x, so there are some entities in the social world, some y's,
3643200	3649200	which are not such that there is an x of grounding upon which they rest.
3649200	3652200	So, they are freestanding y terms.
3652200	3657200	But you can think of it as quasi abstract.
3657200	3659200	And now, I don't think I need to.
3659200	3662200	So, the obligations and so on nowadays, we record them on paper,
3662200	3666200	but in the olden days, they were recorded in people's memory.
3666200	3673200	Now, a couple of years back, there was a man called Julian Cole,
3673200	3677200	who was a professor in Buff State, a professor of philosophy.
3677200	3680200	And every year also, he would come to you and give a talk
3680200	3684200	about social construction of mathematics.
3684200	3687200	And every year, I really attacked him.
3687200	3689200	He always came back for more.
3689200	3692200	I now think he was right.
3692200	3695200	So, it just shows.
3695200	3698200	So, this is the first of a series of paper.
3698200	3700200	Actually, I think there were two earlier ones,
3700200	3703200	but this is the first of a series of paper.
3703200	3710200	So, he is basically re-creating some of the things I said
3710200	3713200	in the Anthropogenesis of Mathematical Objects paper.
3713200	3716200	We're doing it much better, much more statistically.
3716200	3719200	He captures the creativity and the freedom of mathematics.
3719200	3721200	The big problem is the authority.
3721200	3725200	So, how do you get authority for your mathematics in this country?
3725200	3735200	And now, which is the money phrase in this.
3735200	3740200	So, we have to authenticate the ontological commitments
3740200	3742200	of mathematical theories without curtailing
3742200	3747200	mathematicians' freedom to creatively introduce
3747200	3750200	mathematical ontology.
3750200	3754200	I argue that these two constraints are best met
3754200	3758200	by a metaphysical interpretation of mathematics
3758200	3761200	that takes mathematical entities
3761200	3763200	to be constitutively constructed.
3763200	3767200	By that, he doesn't mean much more than socially constructed.
3767200	3771200	Then, in the next paper, he brings in the dimension of institutions,
3771200	3773200	which is what I've been pointing to
3773200	3777200	when I talk about social memory and recordings
3777200	3780200	which I've developed over time.
3780200	3784200	Notice he uses the freestanding term.
3784200	3786200	I'm not sure he got it for me,
3786200	3789200	but it's nice that he's introduced to serve
3789200	3792200	representational functions.
3792200	3798200	Now, he's describing this institutional reality
3798200	3801200	and the meta-ontology, whatever that means,
3801200	3804200	arguing that the philosophy of mathematics
3804200	3807200	that has its central thesis,
3807200	3811200	sorry, its central tenet,
3811200	3815200	this can account for the objectivity, necessity
3815200	3817200	and the atemporality of mathematics.
3817200	3820200	Now, these are the things which I was arguing with him about.
3820200	3826200	I said you cannot ground the necessity of mathematical truth
3826200	3829200	in a social construction account
3829200	3833200	of the ways mathematical entities begin to exist
3833200	3835200	because, particularly, you take creativity
3835200	3837200	and these other things if you can,
3837200	3841200	you can't creatively create the necessary truth.
3841200	3844200	Now, I think what I would say now
3844200	3847200	is that you can creatively constrain,
3847200	3851200	create a mathematical object
3851200	3854200	and by you describe it in a certain way,
3854200	3858200	it's the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter
3858200	3861200	and then you can infer necessary truth
3861200	3864200	from your description, which is an axiom.
3864200	3867200	That's what I would say now.
3867200	3869200	All right, and then the third one is called
3869200	3871200	social construction mathematics
3871200	3874200	and the collective imposition of function onto reality.
3874200	3877200	So he's really being surly in here,
3877200	3883200	except he's following my freestanding correction of sir.
3883200	3885200	Stereotypes of social construction suggest
3885200	3888200	that the existence of social constructions is accidental
3888200	3892200	and that such constructs have arbitrary and subjective features.
3892200	3895200	Here I explore a conception, so on.
3895200	3899200	In particular, I argue that the collective imposition of function
3899200	3902200	is typically non-accidental
3902200	3904200	and the products of such imposition frequently
3904200	3906200	have non-arbitri and objective features.
3906200	3917200	Now, this is, I think, where he addresses a really difficult point.
3918200	3922200	So when we created pi,
3922200	3924200	there were objective features of reality
3924200	3927200	that we had to confront, namely circles.
3927200	3929200	And we couldn't draw perfect circles,
3929200	3932200	but we could draw very nearly perfect circles.
3932200	3935200	And when we constructed pi,
3935200	3939200	we were indeed bending to those necessary features of reality.
3939200	3942200	But then a place in this can say,
3942200	3944200	Aha!
3944200	3948200	What you mean by pi is a necessary feature of reality,
3948200	3950200	which was there already,
3950200	3953200	because, as we placens know,
3953200	3955200	mathematical entities are a temple.
3955200	3957200	They're not created by people.
3957200	3959200	So there's an issue here.
3959200	3961200	How do we distinguish the mathematical entity
3961200	3964200	from the features of reality
3964200	3968200	which have non-arbitri and objective?
3969200	3974200	So that's an issue that Yorkson and I have to address.
3977200	3980200	I won't talk about document acts.
3980200	3988200	So Rhina has a very complicated ontology of social acts
3988200	3992200	of which speech acts, like promising are one example,
3992200	3994200	and of the parts of social acts
3994200	4000200	and of whether the underlying experiences,
4000200	4002200	the underlying mental content,
4002200	4004200	are states or processes,
4004200	4008200	and whether they need to be addressed to other people,
4008200	4011200	whether they need to be registered by their addresses.
4014200	4017200	The founding relation is that you can't marry somebody
4017200	4019200	unless you have a certain authority.
4019200	4022200	All of these are a prior issues.
4022200	4024200	What they give rise to.
4024200	4028200	So a promise gives rise to a mutually correlated claim
4028200	4030200	and obligation, for instance.
4036200	4038200	And then the entities which have to obtain
4038200	4043200	in order for the social acts to take place.
4043200	4045200	And such adds relations of authority.
4045200	4047200	That's an entity.
4047200	4049200	And then other parts of social acts.
4049200	4051200	So when you make a promise,
4051200	4054200	there has to come into being a disposition on your part
4054200	4055200	to realize the promise.
4055200	4057200	Otherwise you didn't make a promise.
4058200	4062200	So the promise is necessarily dependent on the disposition
4062200	4063200	on the part of the promise.
4063200	4066200	All of these are a prior laws.
4066200	4069200	And you can represent them in diagrams.
4070200	4072200	And then once you have these diagrams,
4072200	4074200	you can see that there are modifications.
4074200	4078200	So there are different kinds of sham promises, for instance.
4078200	4082200	And different kinds of collective social acts.
4082200	4086200	And the modifications occur because some elements here
4086200	4087200	are missing.
4087200	4090200	So maybe that no one registers the promise.
4090200	4092200	Or maybe that there's no sincere attention.
4092200	4095200	Or it may be that no action follows.
4095200	4097200	You never actually fulfil the promise.
4097200	4099200	And so no trust.
4099200	4101200	That's another dimension.
4101200	4103200	And you can apply the whole thing,
4103200	4106200	which is very similar to the case of commanding.
4106200	4108200	Commanding is just switching.
4108200	4111200	The commander-commandee relation
4111200	4115200	so that it becomes a commandee-commandee relation.
4116200	4117200	All right.
4117200	4119200	Now, the most important of all of these,
4119200	4121200	all of these social acts,
4121200	4124200	is the act of enactment.
4125200	4127200	And if you have a dollar bill,
4127200	4129200	anyway, if you have a pound, a British pound,
4129200	4132200	now you see that there is a declaration
4132200	4135200	from the Governor of the Bank of England
4135200	4138200	that he will pay the bearer of this pound note,
4138200	4140200	one pound.
4140200	4143200	And then there's a signature underneath.
4143200	4146200	Now, when that signature was made,
4146200	4148200	when the relevant actor,
4148200	4151200	then the pound note came into existence,
4151200	4154200	both that particular instance and the genre,
4154200	4157200	the type of document.
4157200	4160200	And it came into existence through enactment.
4160200	4163200	And this enactment had a mathematical dimension
4163200	4165200	because a pound note was then,
4165200	4169200	in the good old days, worth exactly 240 pence.
4169200	4174200	And you could even make it worth 480 hapenies,
4174200	4177200	which is a half pence.
4177200	4180200	And that's important for some of the entities
4180200	4182200	which are brought into being by enactment,
4182200	4184200	which are very important, particularly in the economic domain,
4184200	4187200	namely that you can divide them mathematically
4187200	4189200	into perfectly equal fractions.
4189200	4192200	So, this is the first paragraph
4192200	4194200	of the German civil code,
4194200	4196200	which Reina wrote a lot about.
4196200	4202200	And it tells us how a subject of rights begins to exist.
4202200	4205200	But it doesn't tell us as a fact.
4205200	4210200	It enacts a social fact.
4210200	4216200	The social phenomenon of a thing that is subject to rights
4216200	4219200	begins to exist at the completion of birth
4219200	4222200	as a result of this enactment.
4222200	4226200	So, it makes the entity, namely an organism subject to rights.
4226200	4231200	And that is the model for how mathematical entities currently exist.
4231200	4233200	It's a matter of enactment.
4233200	4239200	And here, the enactment is towards all the subjects in the society,
4239200	4241200	in Germany in this case.
4241200	4244200	And in mathematics, the enactment would be to all the subjects
4244200	4247200	engaged in a particular kind of mathematics,
4247200	4249200	both present and future.
4249200	4251200	All right, we don't need this.
4251200	4255200	Now, when we think about enactments,
4255200	4258200	then we realise that there are three sorts of history
4258200	4261200	that an entity can have.
4261200	4266200	So, numbers, if you're a Platonist or a believer in Chronica,
4266200	4272200	have an atemporal or, what's the word?
4272200	4274200	Omnitemporal exists.
4274200	4276200	They exist all the time. They never change.
4276200	4279200	They don't have any causal features at all.
4279200	4283200	And then you have Bill Clinton, who's changing all the time.
4283200	4287200	And that's true of all other organisms, buildings,
4287200	4293200	everything in the real world of what happens and is the case.
4293200	4295200	They're subject to constant changes through time.
4295200	4297200	And they have a beginning to exist in time,
4297200	4301200	and he, even Bill, will die in some stage.
4301200	4304200	19 minutes or so later, he will cease to exist.
4304200	4307200	Or maybe he'll have a bit of a longer time,
4307200	4311200	but he will die sometime.
4311200	4314200	But now Clinton's presidency is different from these.
4314200	4319200	Clinton's presidency began to exist at a certain point in time.
4319200	4322200	It existed, and then it ceased to exist.
4322200	4327200	And this is characteristic of the way in which entities,
4327200	4330200	which are inactive, exist.
4330200	4334200	They are part of history, but they do not change.
4334200	4338200	They just come into existence, exist, and then go out of existence.
4338200	4342200	Now, mathematical entities may never go out of existence,
4342200	4345200	so they may just have this part.
4345200	4347200	They make this go on forever.
4347200	4350200	But certainly things like presidencies, obligations,
4350200	4355200	debts, permissions, and the like, they have this shape.
4355200	4359200	And all offices, being senator, being...
4359200	4360200	Yes?
4360200	4363200	Are universals like one?
4363200	4364200	Yes.
4364200	4366200	Well, so that is...
4366200	4369200	some universals are like one.
4371200	4374200	Are universals dependent on their existence,
4374200	4376200	on the existence of existence?
4376200	4380200	Yes, so I don't want to go into that story,
4380200	4382200	although it would be a story that we have to go into
4382200	4385200	in the ultimate statement of history.
4385200	4388200	But, yes, it's a good question,
4388200	4391200	which means I don't have a good answer.
4391200	4393200	I will have a good answer.
4395200	4401200	All right, so in the first group we have necessary objects.
4401200	4403200	In the second group we have contingent objects,
4403200	4406200	caught up in the world of causality.
4406200	4410200	And in the third group we have objects which are intelligible,
4410200	4413200	but have a starting point in time.
4413200	4424200	And so I think that Reina deserves to be honoured
4424200	4428200	to a much greater degree than he is,
4428200	4431200	because I believe he was the first philosopher ever
4431200	4434200	to recognise that there are objects of this kind.
4434200	4436200	So cancer didn't know about this.
4436200	4439200	Plato didn't know about this.
4439200	4443200	The ingarden certainly devoted,
4443200	4445200	but I'm pretty sure that was under the influence
4445200	4448200	of his teacher Reina.
4448200	4450200	And it's amazingly important,
4450200	4452200	because it applies to the whole realm of the law
4452200	4454200	and the whole realm of economics,
4454200	4460200	and many other parts of everyday life,
4460200	4463200	such as the whole realm of the teachers.
4463200	4466200	But people just didn't notice.
4466200	4470200	Still very few people know how important Reina is.
4470200	4476200	All right, now, it applies also to chess.
4476200	4479200	Chess and game generally are another area
4479200	4482200	where we find entities of this third kind.
4482200	4485200	So the chess game was invented, it started to exist,
4485200	4487200	and it has changed in small ways,
4487200	4494200	but still not in ways which disturb the face of the picture.
4494200	4497200	So many of these abstract entities,
4497200	4499200	or historical, cultural entities,
4499200	4503200	these quasi-astract entities of the third kind
4503200	4505200	have quasi-mathematical properties,
4505200	4507200	and that's important.
4507200	4511200	These are some examples.
4511200	4515200	Your social security number is not a number.
4515200	4518200	It doesn't have prime factors or anything.
4518200	4523200	It's a social object, and you can't burn it.
4523200	4528200	It can only be created by a certain process,
4528200	4534200	and it can only be eliminated by a certain process.
4534200	4543200	All right, so I have all the wrong views about that.
4543200	4548200	All right, so I believe that Reina's a priori theory of law
4548200	4552200	is a very good approximation to the underlying ontology
4552200	4555200	of the Austrian School of Economics.
4555200	4560200	So where Reina was talking about the micro-institutions
4560200	4565200	of human life and indeed the meso-institutions
4565200	4568200	of legal affairs,
4568200	4579200	the Austrian School are talking about the micro-economic realm.
4579200	4582200	So these are other areas where the Munich approach
4582200	4586200	to doing ontology could, in principle, be applied,
4586200	4589200	and in some of them, so that colorology and tone theory
4589200	4591200	have been applied to,
4591200	4594200	that they've been developed in ways which are similar
4594200	4597200	to the way the Munich phenomenologists worked,
4597200	4600200	and all of these have been developed
4600200	4603200	by Munich phenomenologists.
4603200	4618200	Reina points out that while there are some relations
4618200	4623200	and some essences or a priori structures
4623200	4627200	which are subject to a priori laws,
4627200	4630200	there are others which are purely conventional.
4630200	4633200	In other words, you add conventions.
4633200	4636200	So an example would be an endowment mortgage
4636200	4641200	or derivatives created by some formula on the stock market,
4641200	4643200	or football team managers.
4643200	4646200	So there are no a priori laws governing football team managers
4646200	4650200	in the way that they are governing pie.
4650200	4653200	But now what is involved in each of these
4653200	4656200	is always that they always have a grounding
4656200	4658200	in a priori social institutions.
4658200	4662200	So the idea of a manager, or the essence manager,
4662200	4665200	is grounded in the fact that one person has authority
4665200	4667200	over other persons,
4667200	4672200	and an endowment mortgage is grounded in the fact
4672200	4676200	that one person can loan money to another person.
4676200	4682200	So what we have here are institutional modifications
4682200	4687200	of a priori institutions or a priori institutional essences.
4687200	4689200	And another example would be,
4689200	4692200	let's suppose that it's true in New York State
4692200	4695200	that a miner cannot sign a contract
4695200	4699200	and be liable for what the contract states
4699200	4701200	that the miner has to supply.
4701200	4704200	This would mean that a contract signed by a miner
4704200	4706200	is not valid.
4706200	4712200	That is not an a priori institutional entity.
4712200	4714200	It's a modification.
4714200	4716200	So this modification, if you are less than 13,
4716200	4718200	you can't sign a contract,
4718200	4720200	is a product of positive law,
4720200	4722200	not a product of a priori law.
4722200	4726200	Rynaw was writing about a priori law,
4726200	4729200	but also about the ways in which a priori law is used
4729200	4732200	as a grounding for positive law,
4732200	4735200	where lawyers and politicians
4735200	4738200	make more or less arbitrary changes
4738200	4741200	to what should obtain in an a priori law
4741200	4744200	or a priori of the underlying institution.
4744200	4747200	And you can see how we're going to have similar modifications
4747200	4749200	in the realm of mathematics.
4749200	4752200	All right, now let me try and move quickly
4752200	4754200	to get to my...
4756200	4758200	I'll put these slides on the...
4758200	4760200	on the witty page.
4760200	4764200	All right, so the idea is we have a history of mathematics
4764200	4766200	and a history of physics,
4766200	4769200	and physics is constantly feeding into the history of mathematics
4769200	4771200	to yield new problems.
4771200	4773200	Mathematic growth,
4773200	4776200	there will be some offshoots where mathematicians grow
4776200	4779200	new kinds of creatures
4779200	4783200	which are not addressing specific needs of physicists
4783200	4785200	or engineers at a given time,
4785200	4787200	but they may later prove to be useful.
4787200	4789200	That's a very common phenomenon
4789200	4792200	that mathematicians are doing something crazy
4792200	4795200	that they are doing it for the sake of the beauty
4795200	4798200	of the entity that they're building,
4798200	4800200	but it turns out to have an application
4800200	4802200	in the next generation.
4802200	4808200	And this is something of an illustration of that.
4808200	4811200	But I found this, and as you know,
4811200	4815200	I like diagrams in the Wikipedia article
4815200	4817200	on mathematical physics.
4817200	4819200	And of course I like it because it contains
4819200	4821200	the word ontology.
4821200	4824200	Now interestingly, the Wikipedia article
4824200	4826200	doesn't mention the word ontology at all,
4826200	4829200	so I have no idea what they meant.
4829200	4831200	They just have the diagram,
4831200	4835200	but there are some things which explain what this means.
4835200	4838200	So we have mathematics, mathematical physics,
4838200	4840200	ontology and physics,
4840200	4842200	and in some way we get physics
4842200	4845200	by taking mathematical physics and taking ontology
4845200	4848200	and smashing them together.
4848200	4853200	And mathematics is somehow feeding into both of those.
4853200	4856200	And I understand how mathematics is feeding
4856200	4858200	into mathematical physics.
4858200	4860200	I don't understand what they might mean by this argument,
4860200	4863200	but we've got three hundred fours.
4863200	4868200	Mathematical physics is an approach to physics
4868200	4871200	which emphasises mathematical reading,
4871200	4873200	that's what they say.
4873200	4875200	Theoretical physics is an approach to physics
4875200	4879200	that emphasises observations and experiments.
4879200	4882200	And so we're interested in mathematical physics
4882200	4884200	which is looking at physics
4884200	4891200	as a structure or an endeavour
4891200	4895200	which is aiming to utilise the rigor
4895200	4897200	that you find in mathematics.
4897200	4899200	And I could simplify that by saying
4899200	4901200	it's going to be using these mathematical structures
4901200	4903200	which the mathematicians are inventing.
4903200	4908200	So mathematical physics is import use application testing
4908200	4911200	of mathematical structures to physical phenomena,
4911200	4914200	trying to find which mathematical structure fits
4914200	4917200	a given physical phenomenon.
4917200	4920200	And now we can understand the diagram as follows.
4920200	4923200	So you start historically with a piece of mathematics
4923200	4926200	and this might be a model of mathematics
4926200	4928200	which is a model of periodic motion
4928200	4930200	with constant amplitude
4930200	4932200	which you can define in purely mathematical terms.
4932200	4934200	And then you add ontology
4934200	4936200	and I'm going to take that to mean you add reference
4936200	4940200	to a specific system, in this case the harmonic oscillation term.
4940200	4943200	And specific magnitudes such as force
4943200	4949200	and so forth and amplitude.
4949200	4954200	And when you add ontology to the mathematics
4954200	4958200	where the ontology includes pieces of the physics ontology
4958200	4961200	then you get physics.
4961200	4964200	So that's just a complicated way of saying that
4964200	4966200	physics is the application of mathematics
4966200	4969200	to real world phenomena like oscillation.
4969200	4975200	So we finished exactly on time by my law.
4975200	4980200	Are there any questions?
