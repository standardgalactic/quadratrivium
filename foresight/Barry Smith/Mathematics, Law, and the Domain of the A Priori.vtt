00:00.000 --> 00:08.240
I'm going to talk about today is a survey of the ontology of mathematics.

00:08.240 --> 00:19.040
I'm going to go through this quickly and so I'll go through the main options in the ontology of mathematics very quickly.

00:19.040 --> 00:24.680
And then I am going to spend a little bit more time describing the option that Yorbsden and I are developing,

00:24.680 --> 00:27.280
..which is not completely original..

00:27.360 --> 00:30.800
..but it's original as applied to mathematics.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.400
It's also original in the sense that it's still new.

00:33.480 --> 00:38.600
Which means that we haven't, by any means, identified all the weak points.

00:38.680 --> 00:45.040
And even the phrasing, in other words, the terminological choices..

00:45.120 --> 00:47.920
..that we want to make in order to make our view clear..

00:48.000 --> 00:51.160
..they're still somewhat uncertain.

02:47.060 --> 02:53.060
Theoretic said that to believe that there are mathematical entities is just a mistake now

02:53.060 --> 02:58.820
we can use mathematical symbols to do all kinds of wonderful things but those symbols don't

02:58.820 --> 03:05.760
refer to anything and those who think they're referring to something are just making a mistake,

03:05.760 --> 03:10.480
this mistake is a very useful mistake to make but it's a mistake.

03:10.480 --> 03:25.200
followed by a related in the sense that there isn't really a festa mindist rather emotemical internetist is a logical system.

03:25.200 --> 03:39.200
Lodgeth is not about anything to say that if p then p or q is not about anything, but it is a valid rule of logic.

03:39.200 --> 03:49.200
Now what logitism says is that mathematics is a branch of logic, and therefore mathematics doesn't say anything, it's not about anything.

03:49.200 --> 03:57.200
It gives you certain kinds of rules of inference. We'll say a little bit about that, but we're not going to take it very far.

03:57.200 --> 04:14.200
That is the most mature view of mathematics, and the most thoroughly developed, but unfortunately it was also shown to be not workable at different levels.

04:14.200 --> 04:26.200
Now another view, and again I'm not sure this has ever had any defenders in mathematics, but has had defenders in other areas like ethics.

04:26.200 --> 04:35.200
It might be called anything that satisfies them, and the idea here is that if you have a complicated theory about ethics for instance,

04:35.200 --> 04:46.200
and you don't know what norms or values or good or evil are, then you just present your theory as a collection of axioms,

04:46.200 --> 04:55.200
and you say anything that satisfies these axioms is a norm or is a value. I don't know what those things are, and I don't care because I have my axioms.

04:55.200 --> 05:07.200
That is a whole programme in philosophy called the camera programme, because it was invented and I think it's still defended by some people in camera.

05:08.200 --> 05:25.200
Platonism, this is probably the oldest but not the most well-developed theory, says that there is a whole realm of mathematical entities which are abstract or atemporal outside our purview.

05:25.200 --> 05:43.200
It's not part of the empirical world, and mathematics is about those entities, so mathematicians stare up into this platonic heaven and they decide how to write their axioms, and you do see some mathematicians staring up when they were.

05:43.200 --> 06:04.200
The big problem with this is that we have to explain how it should be that truths about abstract entities in some transcended realm could be so useful when doing physics for instance, and that's the big problem in philosophy of mathematics, namely how do we explain the applicability for mathematics.

06:04.200 --> 06:16.200
The final view, and our view will be a sub-view under this heading, although you'll taste the idea that we might be social constructionists. We are good social constructionists.

06:16.200 --> 06:33.200
The final view says that mathematical entities are social constructions, and I will give you some examples of bad social constructionism, and then I hope you will be convinced that there is also good social constructionism, and then we will argue that mathematics is one example.

06:33.200 --> 06:38.200
I think there's another option, that is the fictionalism.

06:38.200 --> 06:50.200
Oh yes, you're right. Actually it was on my list, but somehow I did it. Fictionalism is a bit like the error theory. Fictionalism says that mathematical entities are like fictional entities.

06:50.200 --> 06:57.200
In fact my very first publication defends of you like that, but in a good way.

06:57.200 --> 07:07.200
Alright, so fictionalism is whenever I use a zoom in the university the internet breaks down.

07:08.200 --> 07:22.200
So in order to avoid the consequences of that I'm going to record in the real world rather than in the zoom world.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.200
I'm recording if you want.

07:24.200 --> 07:29.200
You could record it. You are recording. I will record it anyway just for fun.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.200
Ok, now.

07:45.200 --> 07:49.200
Let me get rid of this with any luck.

07:49.200 --> 07:56.200
It really likes to live things.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.200
Are there any other questions while we're waiting?

08:35.200 --> 08:37.200
Alright.

08:37.200 --> 08:42.200
Can you say fiction is a kind of social construction?

08:42.200 --> 08:45.200
No, because there's nothing constructed.

08:45.200 --> 08:52.200
Well, I guess so, but that's not going to be an important question.

09:01.200 --> 09:11.200
Logicism, as I say, says mathematics is a branch of logic, so if you could express all the theorems and axioms or all the theories of mathematics in logical terms,

09:11.200 --> 09:18.200
then in principle you ought to be able to deduce all of those theorems or all of those axioms from the axioms of logic.

09:18.200 --> 09:30.200
Frager and Russell both believed that this was possible and they both presented their accounts of how you could indeed infer large bodies of mathematics from logic.

09:31.200 --> 09:46.200
In Frager's case, Russell showed that Frager's axioms were inconsistent in creating Russell's paradox, which he created just before Frager's main work was about to go to the press.

09:46.200 --> 10:05.200
Frager was able to add a paragraph at the beginning forward in which he said that Mr Russell has suggested to me that there is some problem, but I believe that this problem can be addressed if you just add this extra wrinkle to some axiom.

10:05.200 --> 10:15.200
That extra wrinkle did indeed work, but only in a universe which had exactly one object or some crazy restriction.

10:15.200 --> 10:34.200
Russell published his own version, along with Whitehead, and he did a much better job in the sense that he was, as far as we can tell, consistent, but the job that he did was very, very complicated.

10:35.200 --> 10:46.200
It was useful in the further development of logicism within the realm of set theory, but it was more complicated than the useful versions of that theory.

10:46.200 --> 10:58.200
The useful versions of logicism say that not that all mathematics is a branch of logic, but that all mathematics can be expressed using set theory, the axioms of set theory.

10:59.200 --> 11:09.200
A set theory is somewhat more powerful than logic as we understand it, and also set theory has problems with itself.

11:09.200 --> 11:18.200
But I know recently there's a song chain called New Fragerism, so some guys may not be able to fix the problem.

11:18.200 --> 11:33.200
These things come back. Anything that satisfies this and we've already mentioned, I've mentioned that Whitehead and Russell work in three volumes, it's called Wikipedia Mathematica.

11:33.200 --> 11:39.200
It's an amazing piece of work, but as I say, it became outmoded.

11:39.200 --> 11:59.200
A logicism, we've talked about. The next bit is taken from a talk I gave 20, maybe more years ago, hence the real old-fashioned design of my slides compared to the new ones, which are much more modern.

12:00.200 --> 12:15.200
I deleted all the animation. This is just an extract, a few slides from this old talk, because economics is one area where social constructionism would seem to be a reasonable choice.

12:16.200 --> 12:30.200
But Austrian economics adds a very important dimension to social constructionism, which I will try to explain very quickly, and then later on we'll see the relevance to mathematics.

12:30.200 --> 12:48.200
Carl Mega was the founder of the Austrian School of Economics. He founded a school, some members of which were associated with Austrian philosophers such as Brentana, and so I published a book on the Austrian School of Philosophy, which contends treatments of Austrian economics.

12:48.200 --> 13:14.200
I also published several papers on Austrian economics. The two running threads which joined together the Austrian economists and the Austrian philosophers are a kind of reverence for Aristotle on the one hand, and then a belief in a priorism on the other hand.

13:14.200 --> 13:34.200
I will explain the a priorism in due course. Now, Mega had a reference for Aristotle in some of his terminology. He also had a reverence for things which were not Aristotelian in other parts of his writing, so Mega is not a simple programme for any kind of Aristotelian approach.

13:35.200 --> 13:55.200
Now, what is economics for the Austrian School? So the economic domain domain includes things like buying and selling, valuing and pricing, putting a price on something and negotiating in many other things.

13:56.200 --> 14:18.200
And if you take the state into account that includes things like taxing and includes banks in the account and includes things like interest rates, loans and so forth, so there are lots of constituent parts of the economic domain and the Austrian School says, well, let's work out what are the necessary dependence relations.

14:19.200 --> 14:36.200
So in order for something to have a price, does it have to have a value? I don't know, but in order for something to have a value, the Austrians would say, it has to be such that someone values it, so there have to be things like preferences.

14:36.200 --> 14:51.200
So we have a dependence relation between value and preference or between value and wanting. Now, this is a very simple example of what we're going to be calling an a priori law.

14:51.200 --> 15:06.200
And what that means is that it's not a matter of logic. In other words, it's not purely empty. There is some content, some real content there. And it's something which is intelligible.

15:06.200 --> 15:20.200
Anybody who understands what value is in the economic realm and what wanting or preferring is in the economic realm can see that value requires wanting or preferring.

15:20.200 --> 15:34.200
This is called subjectivity in the Austrian School. The idea is that things have value only to the degree that the subjects in the relevant society are willing to pay or are willing to barter in order to own those things.

15:34.200 --> 15:47.200
And there are many others such a priori dependence relations in the doctrine of the Austrian School, which become very, very sophisticated and have all kinds of implications.

15:48.200 --> 15:59.200
I've given another one here. You can't have an exchange without having an exchanger and an exchange. You can't have a buying without having a selling and you can't have a selling without having a buying.

15:59.200 --> 16:11.200
There are lots and lots of relations like this. Now, some of them may be analytic in the sense that they are just a matter of definition.

16:11.200 --> 16:29.200
But you see, if we take buying and selling, it can't be that both buying and selling are definable in such a way that it becomes analytic that buying requires selling and selling because of buying.

16:29.200 --> 16:43.200
You have to start either with buying or with selling. You can define selling in terms of buying, but then you have to accept buying and the features of buying as being something which is not analytic.

16:43.200 --> 16:48.200
And I'll talk a little bit about that as we go along.

16:48.200 --> 17:09.200
This is an example of the kind of analysis that Menga created. For him, a good exists only if there is a need. A good implies value and value exists only if there is some kind of a need, whether this be a basic need or whether it's a need of the moment.

17:09.200 --> 17:20.200
For instance, when you see that some film is playing in a cinema and you feel a need to go and see that film, that's not a basic need, but it is a need in the sense of Menga.

17:20.200 --> 17:24.200
A basic need would be the need for food or something.

17:25.200 --> 17:46.200
The object has to be searched and you can satisfy that need. There has to be knowledge, so good exists only where there is knowledge. Knowledge of needs and knowledge of causal connections and not necessarily on your part, there could be causal connections on the part of the seller.

17:46.200 --> 17:57.200
And a command over the thing so you have the money to buy it. Somebody has a copy to sell.

17:57.200 --> 18:11.200
Now, this a priorism as the Austrian school is defended in Menga, but it's defended in a more radical way in Mises, Ludwig von Mises, who was a famous Austrian economist.

18:12.200 --> 18:25.200
First half of the 20th century, with a large school of followers, and he says, and he was influenced by Kant, which may explain why he gets things wrong.

18:25.200 --> 18:35.200
He said that there is only one axiom and that all the other axioms are economic to follow from this one axiom, and the axiom is man and act.

18:35.200 --> 18:46.200
This is the axiom of action. If we understand action, he says, then we understand need, value and all the other things, analytics. They all follow from this one axiom.

18:46.200 --> 18:59.200
And then two of his followers, one from Murray Rothbard. Rothbard, in fact, reviewed the books that I wrote on the Austrian school very friendly.

19:00.200 --> 19:18.200
And Hermann Hoppe, he's a German, which is not necessarily a bad thing, who wrote a very nice book, which I like defending sovereignty. It's called something like The Mistake, which is democracy.

19:19.200 --> 19:25.200
And I like some of the thinking of Hoppe.

19:25.200 --> 19:40.200
All right, now, so we've already mentioned many of the terms that we're going to need, so something is analytic if it's a truth of logic, and we're talking about truths or propositions or judgments or statements.

19:41.200 --> 19:50.200
A truth is synthetic, if it adds to your knowledge, it's not analytic in other words.

19:50.200 --> 19:58.200
Truth is a priori, if it's known independently of experience, which means it's intrinsically intelligible in some way.

19:58.200 --> 20:06.200
And a posteriori just means known via experience, and that is the answer.

20:07.200 --> 20:14.200
You could have picked a better photo for sure.

20:14.200 --> 20:19.200
Absolutely, I did, but he must have looked like it.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.200
I mean, there are better pictures of it.

20:22.200 --> 20:25.200
As an a priori.

20:25.200 --> 20:34.200
So, Kant had the theory of the synthetic a priori, but he thought that he only held for physics.

20:34.200 --> 20:43.200
We have synthetic a priori knowledge about time, space, and causality, and that knowledge is called Newtonian mechanics.

20:43.200 --> 20:54.200
He thought we knew that a priori, and maybe he's right, but the point I'm going to be making in what follows is that there are many, many other areas

20:54.200 --> 21:01.200
that are such that we have a priori knowledge, seemingly, which Kant did not address.

21:01.200 --> 21:11.200
So, Kant may have got some aspects of the synthetic a priori right, but he certainly didn't get the scope right.

21:11.200 --> 21:16.200
All right, so I just said that.

21:16.200 --> 21:26.200
Now, I don't want to talk too much about visas on mega, these are just illustrations.

21:26.200 --> 21:36.200
This is more important, so this shows the Aristotelian basis of mega's views, and general essence and general connection,

21:36.200 --> 21:47.200
they are the two key components of our view of mathematics and physics, actually, when we get to it.

21:47.200 --> 21:52.200
So, in German, that would be Wiesen, and Wiesen's Zusammenhang.

21:52.200 --> 22:00.200
Now, general essence and general, and the general connection of economic phenomena, they sound okay in a sentence like this,

22:00.200 --> 22:13.200
but if you try and write about general essence in a paper published in an analytic philosophy journal, which is the only type of philosophical journal which we're publishing in,

22:13.200 --> 22:19.200
then people will just turn up their noses and say this is something old fashioned, so that's our problem.

22:19.200 --> 22:27.200
So, we would like to call the synthetic a priori truths, which we are studying, basis of Zusammenhang.

22:27.200 --> 22:32.200
General connections of essences, but we can't because it's German.

22:32.200 --> 22:35.200
So, I want to stick with the synthetic a priori truth.

22:35.200 --> 22:44.200
Because we're not talking about truth anymore, we're talking about things on the side of the mathematical or realm of physics.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.200
Can you call the postulates instead of truths?

22:47.200 --> 22:53.200
That's the same problem. So, postulates are on the side of truths. We want to talk about what is on the side of objects.

22:53.200 --> 23:02.200
We want to say that there are essences and essential connections on the side of the objects in themselves, or objects themselves.

23:02.200 --> 23:06.200
And that this is so in mathematics as well as in physics.

23:06.200 --> 23:17.200
In mathematics, if anything, even more obviously the case, but in mathematics, the tendency to see things as being analytic is very strong because of logic.

23:21.200 --> 23:25.200
So, this is another word for it, non-inductive intelligible structures.

23:25.200 --> 23:35.200
Now, we know that every human is born virtually with the capabilities to apprehend, recognise non-inductive intelligible structures.

23:35.200 --> 23:41.200
Differences between colours, for instance, can't be learned. Differences between shapes can't be learned.

23:41.200 --> 23:47.200
Differences between feeling good and feeling bad can't be learned.

23:47.200 --> 23:53.200
And grasp those things innately. They are intrinsically intelligent.

23:53.200 --> 24:03.200
And as we get older, more and more of these intrinsically intelligible structures become evident to us.

24:03.200 --> 24:07.200
So, as a result of the fact that we also learn a lot of things very quickly.

24:07.200 --> 24:15.200
Okay, this is Adolf Reiner, who has a much more, much straighter face than that should be.

24:15.200 --> 24:20.200
He was a philosopher of law, who was also a student of Hussal.

24:20.200 --> 24:29.200
And in 1913 he published a book, Length Monograph, on the a priori foundations of the civil law.

24:29.200 --> 24:33.200
And it's that which is our model for mathematics.

24:33.200 --> 24:37.200
We want to do the ontology of mathematics based on this Reinachian approach.

24:37.200 --> 24:48.200
And I have a lot of slides now about Reinach, but I'll go through them very quickly, so don't be disturbed by the fact that I'm going through them very quickly, because we don't need them most of the time.

24:48.200 --> 24:53.200
Let me say a little bit more about Reinach, just for interest sake.

24:53.200 --> 25:00.200
So, Reinach was sometimes referred to by Hussal's followers, so Reinach was a follower of Hussal.

25:00.200 --> 25:05.200
Hussal founded a school, but there was a group of Hussal's followers in Munich.

25:05.200 --> 25:09.200
And Hussal was in Göttingen, and then in Freiburg, he was not in Munich.

25:09.200 --> 25:14.200
So, the Munich School of Phenomenology is a kind of separate wing.

25:15.200 --> 25:26.200
And they were accused by Hussal of practicing what he later on, when he became critical of some of the Munich School work, of practicing picture book phenomena.

25:26.200 --> 25:40.200
What that means is they would take a domain like aesthetics or chemistry or ethics or the will, and they would draw phenomenological pictures, diagrams effectively, although they didn't use diagrams,

25:40.200 --> 25:45.200
but they were thinking in a way in which you could capture very well diagrammatically.

25:45.200 --> 25:52.200
That's why I like them, incidentally. I like diagrammatically the representations of philosophical views.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.200
That's why I became an ontologist.

25:55.200 --> 26:09.200
So, Reinach was almost certainly the cleverest of these people, and he was referred by other people later on, even when he moved to Göttingen to be in the same town,

26:09.200 --> 26:14.200
in the same university, and he was referred to as the phenomenologists.

26:14.200 --> 26:19.200
Because you should go to him if you wanted to know about phenomenology, not to Hussal.

26:19.200 --> 26:22.200
He was a much better teacher.

26:22.200 --> 26:27.200
Now, another person who was in Göttingen is Edith Stein.

26:27.200 --> 26:31.200
And I ought to see if you all know who Edith Stein is.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.200
Edith Stein.

26:33.200 --> 26:39.200
So, she was Hussal's assistant during this period.

26:39.200 --> 26:44.200
She helped Hussal write at least one of his books.

26:44.200 --> 26:50.200
Hussal obviously couldn't give her a job because she was a woman.

26:50.200 --> 26:57.200
But she was Jewish, but she converted to Christianity.

26:57.200 --> 27:01.200
But she was sent to a concentration camp.

27:01.200 --> 27:10.200
Her life was a model of singiness, and so, after she died, they made her a saint.

27:10.200 --> 27:16.200
So, the Munich school had at least one saint as a member.

27:16.200 --> 27:24.200
But actually, it had two, because another member of the Munich school, who was also a friend of Edith Stein and Reinach,

27:25.200 --> 27:39.200
was a Polish philosopher called Roman Ingaarden, who applied the Munich phenomenological method to works of art, literature, architecture, music, and so forth, among other things.

27:39.200 --> 27:50.200
And one of Ingaarden's friends in Poland, when he went back to Poland, became the Pope, the Polish Pope, who was now a saint.

27:50.200 --> 28:01.200
And the Polish Pope was a professor of philosophy, and he was focusing on Thomas Aquinas and Max Schela.

28:01.200 --> 28:17.200
Max Schela is another member of the Munich school who applied the phenomenological method, in his case, to everything under the sun from aristocracy to war, to the greatness of Germany and the impoverishedness of the grocery in England and so on.

28:17.200 --> 28:26.200
So, Schela was fantastically all-encompassing, but his book on his ethics is also fantastic.

28:26.200 --> 28:38.200
All right, so this work, like the Speech Act theory of Austen and Stealth, starts out with a promise.

28:38.200 --> 28:50.200
The promise is a phenomenon which we're all familiar with and which is obeying a priori look, just like buying and selling.

28:50.200 --> 28:57.200
In fact, it's related to buying and selling because there are some promise aspects involved in many economic transactions.

28:57.200 --> 29:01.200
Contracts are promises.

29:01.200 --> 29:11.200
And now, this is a very good source book about Reina and the whole Munich school.

29:11.200 --> 29:15.200
Okay, I'll come back to Reina in a minute. Let me just talk about social constructionism.

29:15.200 --> 29:23.200
First of all, it's a big bad, ugly vegetable garden with different kinds of views.

29:23.200 --> 29:28.200
A very illustrative account of this big bad vegetable garden is by Ian Hacking.

29:28.200 --> 29:32.200
It's called the social construction of what.

29:32.200 --> 29:40.200
And some of the examples he deals with in that book are facts, gender, quarks, madness, reality and so on.

29:40.200 --> 29:47.200
So, the idea that madness is socially constructed would turn on the fact that particular terms like hysteria,

29:47.200 --> 29:53.200
which were very common in the Victorian times but which are now completely not used,

29:53.200 --> 30:00.200
would suggest that what those particular terms referred to was a worse social construction.

30:00.200 --> 30:05.200
That's the kind of idea, always a historical idea in Hacking,

30:05.200 --> 30:14.200
that Hacking uses to characterise, identify social constructions.

30:14.200 --> 30:21.200
All right, now, I'm going to talk a little bit about In-Garden

30:21.200 --> 30:32.200
because this will give us a clone to the complexity that can be found on the side of socially constructed entities.

30:32.200 --> 30:37.200
Now, the whole world of works of art is clearly socially constructed.

30:37.200 --> 30:43.200
There are clearly different tastes at different times in the history of art,

30:43.200 --> 30:50.200
which makes certain things beautiful to one generation that would not necessarily be beautiful to another generation.

30:50.200 --> 31:00.200
Now, In-Garden's approach to unpacking the ontological structure of a work of art is in terms of what he calls strata.

31:00.200 --> 31:10.200
So, a work of art for In-Garden has strata which we need to apprehend in order to apprehend the work as a whole,

31:10.200 --> 31:12.200
but we apprehend them as a unity.

31:12.200 --> 31:17.200
This is a work of literature. We have phonetic formations.

31:17.200 --> 31:29.200
In other words, when we read a poem or a novel, then we read in such a way that we read the words as being spoken with a given accent.

31:29.200 --> 31:35.200
For instance, if we read a novel in which there is a German or a Russian character,

31:35.200 --> 31:44.200
we may hear the German or the Russian accent, but in any case, there are sounds afoot in the literary work.

31:44.200 --> 31:52.200
If you don't have any sound associations when you read a work, then you're not getting the full body of the work as an aesthetic object.

31:52.200 --> 31:58.200
Then there are meanings, simple meanings and complex meanings of all the sentences and paragraphs and so on.

31:58.200 --> 32:02.200
Then there are what In-Garden calls schematised aspects.

32:02.200 --> 32:09.200
So, we are presented with the hero as having long black hair, but we're not presented.

32:09.200 --> 32:16.200
We don't know how long, and we don't know whether it's genuinely black or whether it's dyed, so that it's schematised aspects.

32:16.200 --> 32:26.200
That means that we don't know everything. We only know certain things, a finite number of things about the places and people and actions presented in the work.

32:27.200 --> 32:36.200
Then there are those places and people and actions and states of affairs which are presented in the work, and they form a stratum in and of themselves.

32:36.200 --> 32:45.200
In some cases, there will be value qualities and metaphysical qualities which you apprehend when you read it.

32:45.200 --> 32:52.200
The In-Garden has a very complicated account of what it is to read a literary work.

32:53.200 --> 33:00.200
What the work is depends also upon the readings that take place.

33:00.200 --> 33:08.200
He has a theory of the literary work of art as being a product of human intentions.

33:08.200 --> 33:11.200
Now, that's a kind of social construction.

33:11.200 --> 33:21.200
So, if you just throw a lot of ink on paper and it comes out with words, to be words, by whatever means,

33:21.200 --> 33:29.200
but no, it's never sold, it's never given to anybody as a novel, then it does not exist as a literary work.

33:29.200 --> 33:32.200
A literary work exists only if there is a readership.

33:32.200 --> 33:39.200
Now, it may be that no one reads it anymore, but still it exists because there was once a readership.

33:39.200 --> 33:47.200
So, it's a social construction because the readership is a social entity.

33:47.200 --> 33:51.200
And the author is relatively insignificant.

33:51.200 --> 33:57.200
So, the author doesn't decide what the meanings are or what the schematised aspects are.

33:57.200 --> 34:03.200
I accept, insofar as he gives all the clues that you can ever get when he writes the novel.

34:03.200 --> 34:07.200
It's the readers who make those decisions.

34:07.200 --> 34:13.200
Clearly, they'll be guided by what the author says, and they will share lots of assumptions that the author shares,

34:13.200 --> 34:16.200
but they may also have different assumptions.

34:16.200 --> 34:20.200
All right, so, an example, well, now I won't do the next one.

34:20.200 --> 34:25.200
Now, music has only two aspects, or in some cases only one.

34:25.200 --> 34:31.200
So, we're talking now about, not about opera, but about synthesis of one second.

34:31.200 --> 34:40.200
And some works of music have value qualities, they have a kind of metaphysical quality about them.

34:40.200 --> 34:45.200
But, basically, what music is characterised by, and here is an error,

34:45.200 --> 34:52.200
is not by words sounds as it says here, but by sound.

34:52.200 --> 34:59.200
So, the work of music is a sound formation, a big one.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.200
Yes, Carmella.

35:04.200 --> 35:09.200
Are readers or audiences co-agents?

35:09.200 --> 35:13.200
It comes down to that, yes.

35:13.200 --> 35:19.200
It's not symmetry.

35:19.200 --> 35:27.200
So, basically, in Garden has a view according to which the work of art has a life.

35:27.200 --> 35:34.200
It's born when the author pushes the manuscript on the publisher's desk, or a bit later than that,

35:34.200 --> 35:41.200
and it dies when the planet is annihilated or everyone stops reading it.

35:41.200 --> 35:46.200
And during that time, the readers determine what the significance, meaning, the sounds even.

35:46.200 --> 35:52.200
So, Shakespeare, we hear now, if it's performed today, may be in a kind of old-fashioned English.

35:52.200 --> 35:59.200
But still, it's English, where in Shakespeare's day, the accent that people spoke in England

35:59.200 --> 36:05.200
was a combination of what is today Yorkshire and Danish.

36:05.200 --> 36:08.200
And that's quite different from what the way we hear Shakespeare now,

36:08.200 --> 36:15.200
and that means that Shakespeare's plays have, in their life, evolved to be different today

36:15.200 --> 36:21.200
from what they were in the olden days that Mark created.

36:21.200 --> 36:23.200
And the examples come from set theory.

36:23.200 --> 36:30.200
The best example of autonomous mathematical objects, I say, are the numbers.

36:30.200 --> 36:37.200
And so, the German mathematician Chronica had a saying, which has been repeated many times,

36:37.200 --> 36:43.200
God made the natural numbers. All the rest is the work of man.

36:43.200 --> 36:47.200
So, I'm defending the... something like the Chronica theory.

36:47.200 --> 36:54.200
And then, the second paper I published was on the same topic, actually, I was already boring.

36:54.200 --> 37:02.200
So, I just went into more details about the historical aspect of mathematics,

37:02.200 --> 37:09.200
although I didn't really say any of the things that Jobs and I want to say now about the history of mathematics,

37:09.200 --> 37:14.200
because I was working with a rather narrowly constrained phenomenological framework.

37:14.200 --> 37:20.200
I was working to find a way of applying Ingarth's ideas to mathematical entities.

37:20.200 --> 37:26.200
And then, the third paper I will mention, all of this is within the 1970s.

37:26.200 --> 37:33.200
These were the... I think this was not the third paper I published.

37:33.200 --> 37:43.200
This paper is about this relation between representations on the one hand and the real world now.

37:44.200 --> 37:50.200
And so, there is this picture. It was really published.

37:50.200 --> 37:56.200
It didn't force me to make a real print quality graphic, unfortunately.

37:56.200 --> 38:02.200
So, that's the real world down there, and the real world, of course, includes consciousness.

38:02.200 --> 38:06.200
And the graphic doesn't even capture that very well.

38:06.200 --> 38:11.200
And because there is consciousness, there are all kinds of targets of intentionality.

38:12.200 --> 38:19.200
Now, some of these targets of intentionality, which are in the inner suburbs, if you like, might exist.

38:19.200 --> 38:29.200
So, for instance, the snow-smoking zone in a restaurant that's socially constructed, if it really exists,

38:29.200 --> 38:34.200
Poland really exists, that's socially constructed.

38:34.200 --> 38:42.200
But some of the things in the outer suburbs are dependent for their ontological status exclusively upon consciousness.

38:42.200 --> 38:47.200
And examples would be fictional characters.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.200
Now, the question is where mathematics goes.

38:50.200 --> 38:58.200
In the earlier papers, I had an argument for the role for two kinds of mathematical entities.

38:59.200 --> 39:05.200
But this is about all the different kinds of entities that we can be directed towards in our mental experience.

39:05.200 --> 39:11.200
Some of them are autonomous, some of them are intentional, but they really exist, like Poland,

39:11.200 --> 39:13.200
and some of them are purely intentional.

39:13.200 --> 39:20.200
So, they can be targets, but they don't exist in any sense, such as Hamlet in play,

39:20.200 --> 39:25.200
or better Sherlock Holmes in the novel.

39:25.200 --> 39:32.200
Now, this is a slightly richer diagram, so it's a better diagram.

39:32.200 --> 39:42.200
So, the inner suburbs now are counted as parts of the real world, but the parts of it here are still dependent upon consciousness.

39:42.200 --> 39:51.200
And these are intentional, so the rocks and the planets are autonomous, but everything above the line is intentional.

39:52.200 --> 39:58.200
And the outer suburbs then are fictional, basically.

39:58.200 --> 40:05.200
Now, how many people have heard of intuitionism as a philosophy of mathematics?

40:05.200 --> 40:07.200
A couple of you, three.

40:07.200 --> 40:17.200
So, intuitionism is one of the classic positions that people developed in the philosophy of mathematics.

40:17.200 --> 40:24.200
After the failure of Frege, people wanted a more grounded foundation for mathematics.

40:24.200 --> 40:26.200
They wanted to have certainty.

40:26.200 --> 40:30.200
Frege thought he had certainty, but the whole thing plopped.

40:30.200 --> 40:39.200
Frege is fantastic, his contributions are fantastic, but his account of logicism was a failure,

40:39.200 --> 40:42.200
and therefore his account of mathematics is a failure.

40:42.200 --> 40:53.200
Brower and Heiting developed their own peculiar way of shoring up the safety of mathematical claims,

40:53.200 --> 41:02.200
and the way he said, we can only believe in mathematical objects if we've constructed them in a construction,

41:02.200 --> 41:09.200
and a construction is a kind of proof, so you can construct numbers by counting to them.

41:09.200 --> 41:17.200
There were some extreme followers of this kind of view who said that since we can't count to, let's say, 600 billion,

41:17.200 --> 41:20.200
600 billion is already infinite.

41:20.200 --> 41:27.200
They were called finitists, and the leader of the finitist movement is now dead, I assume.

41:27.200 --> 41:33.200
This was called Yes it involved it, and maybe there were no other members.

41:33.200 --> 41:43.200
Brower and Heiting were much better than finitism, so they developed a version of calculus on intuitionist lines.

41:43.200 --> 41:54.200
The main way of understanding intuitionism is to find out that it implies that we cannot believe in the law of excluded middle.

41:54.200 --> 42:08.200
The law of excluded middle says that if you've proved that not P, then you can infer that P, and that fails for intuitionism,

42:08.200 --> 42:19.200
because you might have a constructed proof that not P, but no constructed proof that P, and you can only assert P when you have a constructed proof.

42:19.200 --> 42:30.200
This is a very interesting idea, so some of you will know that I studied with Michael Dummit in Oxford,

42:30.200 --> 42:38.200
and I attended a whole terms worth of lectures by Dummit on the intuitionistic calculus,

42:38.200 --> 42:43.200
which is like doing calculus with one hand tied behind your back,

42:43.200 --> 42:49.200
but you learn a lot if you have to do calculus without using the law of excluded middle.

42:49.200 --> 42:57.200
Now, but it died, basically. There are very few people who believe in intuitionism as a movement anymore,

42:57.200 --> 43:05.200
but it became a settled part of what you might call the lattice of mathematical options.

43:06.200 --> 43:17.200
If you regard a mathematical theory, so I say lattice, I could say Boolean algebra,

43:17.200 --> 43:23.200
I suppose we have each approach to mathematics, sees mathematics as a Boolean algebra,

43:23.200 --> 43:31.200
then you can see the intuitionistic mathematics as a special kind of Boolean algebra, a weaker Boolean algebra,

43:31.200 --> 43:40.200
and to be precise, it's a relatively pseudo-complemented pseudo-Boolean algebra.

43:40.200 --> 43:47.200
Pseudo-complemented means that if you know A and you know not A,

43:47.200 --> 43:51.200
then you don't know that you've filled the whole space of options.

43:51.200 --> 44:00.200
That's not quite right, but anyway, I won't say any more, you can work it out for yourself.

44:00.200 --> 44:08.200
All right, so this paper I published, this is chronic, my example were Cantor set theory,

44:08.200 --> 44:14.200
and then there are transfinite cardinals. So Cantor set theory is a theory of sets, it works very well for.

44:14.200 --> 44:19.200
Finite sets, people show that it works very well for infinite sets,

44:19.200 --> 44:29.200
but now you get a lot of freedom in creating more and more types of really, really big infinite sets.

44:30.200 --> 44:38.200
Clearly, there are different paths you can take in building bigger and bigger infinite sets,

44:38.200 --> 44:44.200
and it seemed to me intuitive that some of those paths might be leading to truth,

44:44.200 --> 44:49.200
but at least some of them, and you could make a fake one if necessary,

44:49.200 --> 44:52.200
at least some of them are not leading to truth.

44:52.200 --> 44:59.200
So transfinite cardinals of this sort, just a very messy sort,

44:59.200 --> 45:05.200
but one clue whether a particular branch of set theory is useful, or is real,

45:05.200 --> 45:12.200
it's about real things, is whether it's useful, and some transfinite set theories are useful

45:12.200 --> 45:19.200
for physics or in some other economic field, and so they probably are about real mathematical sets,

45:19.200 --> 45:24.200
some of them are not useful, and they might be good candidates for being fictional,

45:24.200 --> 45:27.200
so it's beautiful fictional mathematics.

45:29.200 --> 45:36.200
All right, now the next topic we have to deal with is structuralism.

45:36.200 --> 45:43.200
So if we want to say that pi is a socially constructed entity,

45:43.200 --> 45:46.200
we still have to say what kind of entity it is.

45:46.200 --> 45:52.200
Here the plate in his view is still embraced by many people,

45:52.200 --> 45:56.200
including by many mathematicians consciously or not,

45:56.200 --> 46:03.200
but another view which is embraced explicitly in a number of very influential publications is structuralism,

46:03.200 --> 46:07.200
and this says that mathematical entities are structures,

46:07.200 --> 46:13.200
and the locus classicus of this view, which is also the first paper I read in the philosophy of mathematics

46:13.200 --> 46:17.200
when I started studying philosophy of mathematics in Oxford,

46:17.200 --> 46:22.200
is that by a man called Benasirath, this is a classic of the philosophy of mathematics,

46:22.200 --> 46:28.200
and his idea is you take Russell's theory of what numbers are,

46:28.200 --> 46:33.200
and you take, I think this is Cantor's theory of what numbers are,

46:33.200 --> 46:40.200
and so three is the set consisting of zero, one, two, and so forth,

46:40.200 --> 46:44.200
and you get two logically incompatible accounts of what numbers are,

46:44.200 --> 46:51.200
both of which have perfectly good application, there's no difference in the degree to which they're useful.

46:51.200 --> 46:56.200
There are many other accounts of what numbers are, you could generate your own theory,

46:56.200 --> 47:02.200
and so Benasirath concluded that numbers are none of these things,

47:02.200 --> 47:09.200
rather we have a certain structure which we could call the number structure,

47:09.200 --> 47:14.200
and this number structure is exemplified here and there,

47:14.200 --> 47:18.200
and in all of the other various candidate accounts of what numbers are.

47:18.200 --> 47:29.200
So numbers are nodes in structures, and they are probably themselves structures.

47:29.200 --> 47:33.200
Everything is a structure from the point of view of structuralism.

47:33.200 --> 47:43.200
Now, we, Ylfynai Embrace, structuralism, but we do not hold that all of mathematics are structures,

47:43.200 --> 47:49.200
we think that would be, that would be turtles all the way down,

47:49.200 --> 47:59.200
and so we want to have some basis, some vision, some essence upon which the vision is examining

47:59.200 --> 48:05.200
at the combinations of vision which are represented standardly and set theory terms could rest,

48:05.200 --> 48:13.200
and so our resting places are going to be zero, one, and maybe the line or the point,

48:13.200 --> 48:17.200
and various other unitary things, so non-structures,

48:17.200 --> 48:22.200
which will be the basic elements out of which the structures are built.

48:22.200 --> 48:28.200
So we're not classical structuralists, we are structuralists with bottom.

48:29.200 --> 48:30.200
All right.

48:31.200 --> 48:33.200
I think Noah has a question.

48:33.200 --> 48:34.200
Yes.

48:34.200 --> 48:37.200
So are natural numbers standard in the grounding?

48:37.200 --> 48:41.200
No, just zero and one, because once you've got zero and one,

48:41.200 --> 48:46.200
you can get all the others, basically by adding one, and adding one again.

48:46.200 --> 48:49.200
Zero and one, and what else?

48:49.200 --> 48:51.200
Well, we don't know.

48:51.200 --> 48:57.200
We almost certainly will never know everything about what constitutes the bottom.

48:58.200 --> 49:03.200
I know things that you can do it with just zero and one, but I'm fighting.

49:03.200 --> 49:05.200
Why wouldn't you be able to?

49:05.200 --> 49:09.200
I just have this feeling in my phone.

49:09.200 --> 49:12.200
How do we get the circle?

49:12.200 --> 49:14.200
What is stopping us?

49:14.200 --> 49:20.200
Is there any errors that we face when we just go down to zero and one?

49:20.200 --> 49:26.200
We need to be able to construct the circle, and it's hard to see how you do that from zero and one.

49:26.200 --> 49:27.200
Yes.

49:27.200 --> 49:30.200
Can we say on empty side is a circle structure?

49:30.200 --> 49:31.200
A what?

49:31.200 --> 49:32.200
Empty side.

49:32.200 --> 49:34.200
Is empty side a structure?

49:34.200 --> 49:35.200
I can't hear it.

49:35.200 --> 49:36.200
Empty set a structure?

49:36.200 --> 49:37.200
Empty set.

49:37.200 --> 49:38.200
Yeah.

49:38.200 --> 49:46.200
When York talks about these things, he identifies zero, empty set, and the null operator.

49:46.200 --> 49:47.200
He thinks they're all the same.

49:47.200 --> 49:55.200
And then he has one, the set, which you can say is the empty set as its only member.

49:55.200 --> 50:00.200
And the progressive operator.

50:00.200 --> 50:03.200
Yeah, you had it on a different side, yeah.

50:03.200 --> 50:04.200
Yes?

50:04.200 --> 50:06.200
Zero and one are...

50:06.200 --> 50:09.200
If they're doing a ground name, where do they exist?

50:11.200 --> 50:14.200
So, that's a very good question.

50:14.200 --> 50:15.200
I would...

50:15.200 --> 50:17.200
What if I exist?

50:17.200 --> 50:20.200
So, zero and one are going to have to be created.

50:20.200 --> 50:23.200
They're going to have to be socially constructed.

50:24.200 --> 50:27.200
So, there are two kinds of mathematical entities.

50:27.200 --> 50:34.200
Those which are socially constructed are the initial, in other words, as part of the ground.

50:34.200 --> 50:47.200
And those which are socially constructed with the help of one or other structural combinatoric relations.

50:47.200 --> 50:53.200
And part of our ontology mathematics includes structure-generating relations, like set-all.

50:53.200 --> 51:02.200
And the idea, the historical idea, would be that they'd discover pi, and then they'd discover...

51:02.200 --> 51:13.200
Or, roughly at the same time, they'd discover all of the geometrical relations that you can construct with compass and ruler.

51:13.200 --> 51:19.200
But first, they'd discover how to construct those things, but they didn't do it in the right order.

51:19.200 --> 51:26.200
So, they discovered pi before they knew of anything about irrational numbers or about sets.

51:26.200 --> 51:32.200
But if you reimagine the history of mathematics so that things are discovered in the right order,

51:32.200 --> 51:39.200
then you get a chain from the very, very simple mathematics to the more complicated.

51:39.200 --> 51:49.200
And then our basic theory says that the principle driver in creating more and more complicated mathematics is physics.

51:49.200 --> 51:59.200
So, as physics develops, engineering develops, people's inventions develop, they need more and more complicated mathematics.

51:59.200 --> 52:07.200
That forces the development of more and more complicated forms of mathematics, and thereby mathematics then continues to develop.

52:07.200 --> 52:11.200
And that's what's happened since about Galileo's time.

52:11.200 --> 52:22.200
There's no worry about a structure-generating and apocalyptic event where enough of us die, and the only remaining people are like the Amazonian tribes.

52:22.200 --> 52:26.200
And do you really want to say those numbers are out of existence?

52:26.200 --> 52:32.200
Yes, so I'm afraid I don't have any choice.

52:32.200 --> 52:35.200
I don't want to say it, but I think it seems like...

52:35.200 --> 52:39.200
What are the chances of aliens being...

52:39.200 --> 52:43.200
So, as long as there are records left...

52:43.200 --> 52:47.200
I mean, we need to leave it like that.

52:47.200 --> 52:50.200
Can you imagine another planet away from here?

52:50.200 --> 52:53.200
Yes, so that is a problem.

52:53.200 --> 52:56.200
So, let's go through your possible scenario.

52:56.200 --> 53:02.200
So, one scenario is that all records and all civilisation is destroyed on Earth,

53:02.200 --> 53:06.200
but there are tribes who survived after a few generations.

53:06.200 --> 53:10.200
They recreate mathematics, but they do it differently in whatever way.

53:10.200 --> 53:16.200
Maybe they do it inconsistently with what we did, but maybe they repeat.

53:16.200 --> 53:22.200
So, they invent part. Is it the same mathematical entity, or is it a different one?

53:22.200 --> 53:28.200
If you're a Platonist, the answer to that question is easy, if you're a social constructionist as well.

53:29.200 --> 53:34.200
I don't know if I'm just one of those questions for which I have no answer.

53:34.200 --> 53:41.200
Now, exactly the same case would be if, on Mars, they did the Martian's Development and Mathematics,

53:41.200 --> 53:45.200
which happened to discover part, would it be the same?

53:45.200 --> 53:51.200
The temptation is to say it would be the same, but that's because Platonism is always the temptation.

53:51.200 --> 53:53.200
Yes?

53:53.200 --> 53:58.200
So, is it not necessary that pie will be different?

53:58.200 --> 54:02.200
No, it's not necessary at all.

54:02.200 --> 54:09.200
For many thousands of years of existence of human beings, they didn't discover part.

54:09.200 --> 54:11.200
It took time.

54:11.200 --> 54:16.200
We see it as being rather trivial, but it wasn't quite complicated to reach that point.

54:16.200 --> 54:22.200
It's complicated to reach the point where you could recognise that a hypotenuse on the right angle of triangle

54:22.200 --> 54:29.200
is not necessarily going to be measurable for the real number.

54:29.200 --> 54:31.200
Yes?

54:31.200 --> 54:36.200
So, now, zero, one, pie are constructed.

54:36.200 --> 54:44.200
No, zero and one are ground stones, they're foundations then. Pie is constructed.

54:44.200 --> 54:47.200
Wait, they're ground stones, but didn't we also create it?

54:47.200 --> 54:50.200
Yes, we'll have to lay the foundations ourselves.

54:50.200 --> 54:52.200
Yes, so create it.

54:52.200 --> 54:57.200
But are there a priori los where nothing is constructed?

54:57.200 --> 55:10.200
So, once we create certain mathematical entities, then certain intelligible truths are forced upon us, really.

55:10.200 --> 55:15.200
It's not that we create them, it's that we're forced upon us.

55:15.200 --> 55:20.200
And now, this is always complicated at the time that the things didn't happen in the right order,

55:20.200 --> 55:28.200
but the people who invented pie knew very well as a matter of a priori truth that pie is the ratio

55:28.200 --> 55:32.200
between the circumference and the diameter of the circle, because that's how they discovered it.

55:32.200 --> 55:36.200
That's what it was meant to be, so that's almost one of it.

55:36.200 --> 55:44.200
But then they discovered various other relations involving pie, and they proved to themselves,

55:44.200 --> 55:51.200
using the Ythelian methods that those relations hold universally for all circles,

55:51.200 --> 55:59.200
and that means that they had more a priori truths and a priori knowledge about pie

55:59.200 --> 56:03.200
as the geometry, geometric understanding developed.

56:03.200 --> 56:06.200
So, we don't make the syndeticate priori, all right?

56:06.200 --> 56:11.200
Truths, we discover them after we've made the objects which they're about.

56:11.200 --> 56:17.200
And this, when I get to the law, this will become clear. Anyone?

56:17.200 --> 56:25.200
All right, so this structuralist that I recommend that you read is Scott, Stu Shapiro in Ohio.

56:25.200 --> 56:35.200
There is a Stu Shapiro in Buffalo. I have to make it clear which Stu Shapiro I am referring to.

56:35.200 --> 56:47.200
So, I think he's right about the first two, but that he's wrong when he says just here.

56:47.200 --> 56:50.200
For him, it is structures all the way.

56:50.200 --> 56:54.200
All right, so now we're going to develop Ryanachian structuralism,

56:54.200 --> 56:59.200
and we're going to start off where Ryanach started, which is in the ontology of law.

56:59.200 --> 57:07.200
And as I said, he invented in 1913 much of the act, but it is simultaneously a speech act.

57:07.200 --> 57:12.200
So, it's not that you have a mental act which you could formulate in words,

57:12.200 --> 57:18.200
a mental act which is formulated in words, and in the case of the promise, it has to be formulated in words.

57:19.200 --> 57:25.200
Visa vi, the promisee, so the promisee has to register that you have made a promise,

57:25.200 --> 57:27.200
otherwise you haven't made a promise.

57:27.200 --> 57:32.200
And all of that is a priorite, a synthetic a priorite.

57:32.200 --> 57:34.200
And Ryanach recognized that.

57:34.200 --> 57:45.200
So, and Austin had glimpses of that, but they didn't want to embrace the doctrine that there is a synthetic a priorite truth.

57:45.200 --> 57:51.200
So, Ryanach is indeed a synthetic a priorite structure, which is what Ryanach is all about.

57:51.200 --> 57:56.200
Ryanach is about the synthetic a priorite structures realized in these sorts of cases,

57:56.200 --> 58:02.200
and also in many other sorts of cases which go to form the law.

58:02.200 --> 58:12.200
So, he developed a whole ontology of social reality, which he expressed in terms of the collective imposition of function.

58:12.200 --> 58:19.200
He is a president, which is a physical thing, but we imposed upon the president the function of ruling the country.

58:19.200 --> 58:22.200
That was a collective imposition of function.

58:22.200 --> 58:26.200
And so, that is the theory of everything in social reality.

58:26.200 --> 58:29.200
It's always a matter of collective imposition of function.

58:29.200 --> 58:31.200
And so, we can do it on objects.

58:31.200 --> 58:37.200
So, we can do it with cathedrals, we can do it with driver's licenses, we can do it with dollar bills.

58:37.200 --> 58:43.200
And this is all captured in this slogan or formula.

58:43.200 --> 58:51.200
So, a cathedral, about building counts as a cathedral in context, if there is a bishop and so on.

58:51.200 --> 58:59.200
So, this human being counts as a president because we have collected the imposition of function upon this.

58:59.200 --> 59:01.200
And this doesn't work.

59:01.200 --> 59:05.200
So, I am one of the few people who showed Searle that he was wrong.

59:05.200 --> 59:08.200
So, he printed a correction.

59:08.200 --> 59:16.200
It doesn't work as a general theory of social entities because a debt is a social entity.

59:16.200 --> 59:21.200
But there is nothing upon which we collectively impose a function.

59:21.200 --> 59:32.200
If you write IOU on such and such, then the debt note is fitting with Searle's formula.

59:32.200 --> 59:40.200
But if I just say I promise to give Ali a hundred dollars tomorrow,

59:40.200 --> 59:50.200
I should let's say 18,000 dollars a year in six months, which is not actually the end.

59:50.200 --> 59:54.200
I signed paperwork, or I will be signing paperwork.

59:54.200 --> 01:00:01.200
The other person who has to release the money has not signed yet.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.200
So, I just promise to Ali.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:09.200
And therefore, I have an obligation to Ali.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:15.200
But my obligation is not a piece of reality, a piece of stone or plastic,

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.200
organic material upon which I impose a function.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.200
So, Searle is wrong and he abandoned this formula.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.200
He said he never meant it here.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:31.200
He abandoned this formula because of what I call freestanding y terms.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.200
So, x counters y.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:38.200
There are some x's which are social entities for which there is no y.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:43.200
Sorry, y counters x, so there are some entities in the social world, some y's,

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:49.200
which are not such that there is an x of grounding upon which they rest.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.200
So, they are freestanding y terms.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:57.200
But you can think of it as quasi abstract.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.200
And now, I don't think I need to.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.200
So, the obligations and so on nowadays, we record them on paper,

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:06.200
but in the olden days, they were recorded in people's memory.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:13.200
Now, a couple of years back, there was a man called Julian Cole,

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:17.200
who was a professor in Buff State, a professor of philosophy.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.200
And every year also, he would come to you and give a talk

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:24.200
about social construction of mathematics.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.200
And every year, I really attacked him.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.200
He always came back for more.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.200
I now think he was right.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.200
So, it just shows.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.200
So, this is the first of a series of paper.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.200
Actually, I think there were two earlier ones,

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.200
but this is the first of a series of paper.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:50.200
So, he is basically re-creating some of the things I said

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.200
in the Anthropogenesis of Mathematical Objects paper.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.200
We're doing it much better, much more statistically.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.200
He captures the creativity and the freedom of mathematics.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.200
The big problem is the authority.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:05.200
So, how do you get authority for your mathematics in this country?

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:15.200
And now, which is the money phrase in this.

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:20.200
So, we have to authenticate the ontological commitments

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.200
of mathematical theories without curtailing

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:27.200
mathematicians' freedom to creatively introduce

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.200
mathematical ontology.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.200
I argue that these two constraints are best met

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:38.200
by a metaphysical interpretation of mathematics

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.200
that takes mathematical entities

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.200
to be constitutively constructed.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.200
By that, he doesn't mean much more than socially constructed.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.200
Then, in the next paper, he brings in the dimension of institutions,

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.200
which is what I've been pointing to

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.200
when I talk about social memory and recordings

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.200
which I've developed over time.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.200
Notice he uses the freestanding term.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.200
I'm not sure he got it for me,

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.200
but it's nice that he's introduced to serve

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.200
representational functions.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:18.200
Now, he's describing this institutional reality

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.200
and the meta-ontology, whatever that means,

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.200
arguing that the philosophy of mathematics

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.200
that has its central thesis,

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.200
sorry, its central tenet,

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:35.200
this can account for the objectivity, necessity

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.200
and the atemporality of mathematics.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.200
Now, these are the things which I was arguing with him about.

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:46.200
I said you cannot ground the necessity of mathematical truth

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.200
in a social construction account

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.200
of the ways mathematical entities begin to exist

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.200
because, particularly, you take creativity

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.200
and these other things if you can,

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.200
you can't creatively create the necessary truth.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.200
Now, I think what I would say now

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.200
is that you can creatively constrain,

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.200
create a mathematical object

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.200
and by you describe it in a certain way,

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:18.200
it's the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.200
and then you can infer necessary truth

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.200
from your description, which is an axiom.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.200
That's what I would say now.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.200
All right, and then the third one is called

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.200
social construction mathematics

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.200
and the collective imposition of function onto reality.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.200
So he's really being surly in here,

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:43.200
except he's following my freestanding correction of sir.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.200
Stereotypes of social construction suggest

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.200
that the existence of social constructions is accidental

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:52.200
and that such constructs have arbitrary and subjective features.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.200
Here I explore a conception, so on.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:59.200
In particular, I argue that the collective imposition of function

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:02.200
is typically non-accidental

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.200
and the products of such imposition frequently

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.200
have non-arbitri and objective features.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:17.200
Now, this is, I think, where he addresses a really difficult point.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.200
So when we created pi,

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.200
there were objective features of reality

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.200
that we had to confront, namely circles.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.200
And we couldn't draw perfect circles,

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.200
but we could draw very nearly perfect circles.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.200
And when we constructed pi,

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:39.200
we were indeed bending to those necessary features of reality.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.200
But then a place in this can say,

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.200
Aha!

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:48.200
What you mean by pi is a necessary feature of reality,

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.200
which was there already,

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.200
because, as we placens know,

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.200
mathematical entities are a temple.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.200
They're not created by people.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.200
So there's an issue here.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.200
How do we distinguish the mathematical entity

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.200
from the features of reality

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:08.200
which have non-arbitri and objective?

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:14.200
So that's an issue that Yorkson and I have to address.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.200
I won't talk about document acts.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:28.200
So Rhina has a very complicated ontology of social acts

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.200
of which speech acts, like promising are one example,

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.200
and of the parts of social acts

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:40.200
and of whether the underlying experiences,

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.200
the underlying mental content,

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.200
are states or processes,

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:48.200
and whether they need to be addressed to other people,

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.200
whether they need to be registered by their addresses.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.200
The founding relation is that you can't marry somebody

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.200
unless you have a certain authority.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.200
All of these are a prior issues.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.200
What they give rise to.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.200
So a promise gives rise to a mutually correlated claim

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.200
and obligation, for instance.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.200
And then the entities which have to obtain

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:23.200
in order for the social acts to take place.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.200
And such adds relations of authority.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.200
That's an entity.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.200
And then other parts of social acts.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.200
So when you make a promise,

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:34.200
there has to come into being a disposition on your part

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.200
to realize the promise.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.200
Otherwise you didn't make a promise.

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.200
So the promise is necessarily dependent on the disposition

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:43.200
on the part of the promise.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.200
All of these are a prior laws.

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.200
And you can represent them in diagrams.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.200
And then once you have these diagrams,

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.200
you can see that there are modifications.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:58.200
So there are different kinds of sham promises, for instance.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:02.200
And different kinds of collective social acts.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.200
And the modifications occur because some elements here

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.200
are missing.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:10.200
So maybe that no one registers the promise.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.200
Or maybe that there's no sincere attention.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.200
Or it may be that no action follows.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.200
You never actually fulfil the promise.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.200
And so no trust.

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.200
That's another dimension.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.200
And you can apply the whole thing,

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.200
which is very similar to the case of commanding.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.200
Commanding is just switching.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:31.200
The commander-commandee relation

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.200
so that it becomes a commandee-commandee relation.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.200
All right.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.200
Now, the most important of all of these,

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.200
all of these social acts,

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.200
is the act of enactment.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.200
And if you have a dollar bill,

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.200
anyway, if you have a pound, a British pound,

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.200
now you see that there is a declaration

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:55.200
from the Governor of the Bank of England

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.200
that he will pay the bearer of this pound note,

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.200
one pound.

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.200
And then there's a signature underneath.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.200
Now, when that signature was made,

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.200
when the relevant actor,

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.200
then the pound note came into existence,

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.200
both that particular instance and the genre,

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:17.200
the type of document.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.200
And it came into existence through enactment.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.200
And this enactment had a mathematical dimension

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.200
because a pound note was then,

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:29.200
in the good old days, worth exactly 240 pence.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:34.200
And you could even make it worth 480 hapenies,

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:37.200
which is a half pence.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.200
And that's important for some of the entities

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.200
which are brought into being by enactment,

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.200
which are very important, particularly in the economic domain,

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.200
namely that you can divide them mathematically

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.200
into perfectly equal fractions.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:52.200
So, this is the first paragraph

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.200
of the German civil code,

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.200
which Reina wrote a lot about.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:02.200
And it tells us how a subject of rights begins to exist.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:05.200
But it doesn't tell us as a fact.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:10.200
It enacts a social fact.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:16.200
The social phenomenon of a thing that is subject to rights

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:19.200
begins to exist at the completion of birth

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.200
as a result of this enactment.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:26.200
So, it makes the entity, namely an organism subject to rights.

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:31.200
And that is the model for how mathematical entities currently exist.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.200
It's a matter of enactment.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:39.200
And here, the enactment is towards all the subjects in the society,

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.200
in Germany in this case.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.200
And in mathematics, the enactment would be to all the subjects

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:47.200
engaged in a particular kind of mathematics,

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.200
both present and future.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.200
All right, we don't need this.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.200
Now, when we think about enactments,

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:58.200
then we realise that there are three sorts of history

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.200
that an entity can have.

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:06.200
So, numbers, if you're a Platonist or a believer in Chronica,

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:12.200
have an atemporal or, what's the word?

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.200
Omnitemporal exists.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.200
They exist all the time. They never change.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.200
They don't have any causal features at all.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.200
And then you have Bill Clinton, who's changing all the time.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:27.200
And that's true of all other organisms, buildings,

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:33.200
everything in the real world of what happens and is the case.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.200
They're subject to constant changes through time.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.200
And they have a beginning to exist in time,

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:41.200
and he, even Bill, will die in some stage.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.200
19 minutes or so later, he will cease to exist.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.200
Or maybe he'll have a bit of a longer time,

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:51.200
but he will die sometime.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.200
But now Clinton's presidency is different from these.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:59.200
Clinton's presidency began to exist at a certain point in time.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.200
It existed, and then it ceased to exist.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:07.200
And this is characteristic of the way in which entities,

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.200
which are inactive, exist.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.200
They are part of history, but they do not change.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:18.200
They just come into existence, exist, and then go out of existence.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:22.200
Now, mathematical entities may never go out of existence,

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.200
so they may just have this part.

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.200
They make this go on forever.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.200
But certainly things like presidencies, obligations,

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:35.200
debts, permissions, and the like, they have this shape.

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:39.200
And all offices, being senator, being...

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.200
Yes?

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:43.200
Are universals like one?

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.200
Yes.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.200
Well, so that is...

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.200
some universals are like one.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.200
Are universals dependent on their existence,

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.200
on the existence of existence?

01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.200
Yes, so I don't want to go into that story,

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.200
although it would be a story that we have to go into

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:05.200
in the ultimate statement of history.

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.200
But, yes, it's a good question,

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.200
which means I don't have a good answer.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.200
I will have a good answer.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:21.200
All right, so in the first group we have necessary objects.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.200
In the second group we have contingent objects,

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.200
caught up in the world of causality.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.200
And in the third group we have objects which are intelligible,

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:33.200
but have a starting point in time.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:44.200
And so I think that Reina deserves to be honoured

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:48.200
to a much greater degree than he is,

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:51.200
because I believe he was the first philosopher ever

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.200
to recognise that there are objects of this kind.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:56.200
So cancer didn't know about this.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.200
Plato didn't know about this.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:03.200
The ingarden certainly devoted,

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.200
but I'm pretty sure that was under the influence

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:08.200
of his teacher Reina.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.200
And it's amazingly important,

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.200
because it applies to the whole realm of the law

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.200
and the whole realm of economics,

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:20.200
and many other parts of everyday life,

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.200
such as the whole realm of the teachers.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.200
But people just didn't notice.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:30.200
Still very few people know how important Reina is.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:36.200
All right, now, it applies also to chess.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.200
Chess and game generally are another area

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.200
where we find entities of this third kind.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:45.200
So the chess game was invented, it started to exist,

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.200
and it has changed in small ways,

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:54.200
but still not in ways which disturb the face of the picture.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.200
So many of these abstract entities,

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.200
or historical, cultural entities,

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.200
these quasi-astract entities of the third kind

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.200
have quasi-mathematical properties,

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.200
and that's important.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.200
These are some examples.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:15.200
Your social security number is not a number.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.200
It doesn't have prime factors or anything.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:23.200
It's a social object, and you can't burn it.

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:28.200
It can only be created by a certain process,

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:34.200
and it can only be eliminated by a certain process.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:43.200
All right, so I have all the wrong views about that.

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:48.200
All right, so I believe that Reina's a priori theory of law

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:52.200
is a very good approximation to the underlying ontology

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:55.200
of the Austrian School of Economics.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:16:00.200
So where Reina was talking about the micro-institutions

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:05.200
of human life and indeed the meso-institutions

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.200
of legal affairs,

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:19.200
the Austrian School are talking about the micro-economic realm.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.200
So these are other areas where the Munich approach

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:26.200
to doing ontology could, in principle, be applied,

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:29.200
and in some of them, so that colorology and tone theory

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.200
have been applied to,

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:34.200
that they've been developed in ways which are similar

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:37.200
to the way the Munich phenomenologists worked,

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.200
and all of these have been developed

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.200
by Munich phenomenologists.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:58.200
Reina points out that while there are some relations

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:03.200
and some essences or a priori structures

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:07.200
which are subject to a priori laws,

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.200
there are others which are purely conventional.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:13.200
In other words, you add conventions.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.200
So an example would be an endowment mortgage

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:21.200
or derivatives created by some formula on the stock market,

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.200
or football team managers.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.200
So there are no a priori laws governing football team managers

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.200
in the way that they are governing pie.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.200
But now what is involved in each of these

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.200
is always that they always have a grounding

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.200
in a priori social institutions.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:42.200
So the idea of a manager, or the essence manager,

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.200
is grounded in the fact that one person has authority

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.200
over other persons,

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:52.200
and an endowment mortgage is grounded in the fact

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:56.200
that one person can loan money to another person.

01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:02.200
So what we have here are institutional modifications

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:07.200
of a priori institutions or a priori institutional essences.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.200
And another example would be,

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.200
let's suppose that it's true in New York State

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:15.200
that a miner cannot sign a contract

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:19.200
and be liable for what the contract states

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.200
that the miner has to supply.

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.200
This would mean that a contract signed by a miner

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.200
is not valid.

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:32.200
That is not an a priori institutional entity.

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.200
It's a modification.

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:36.200
So this modification, if you are less than 13,

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.200
you can't sign a contract,

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.200
is a product of positive law,

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.200
not a product of a priori law.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:46.200
Rynaw was writing about a priori law,

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.200
but also about the ways in which a priori law is used

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:52.200
as a grounding for positive law,

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:55.200
where lawyers and politicians

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:58.200
make more or less arbitrary changes

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:01.200
to what should obtain in an a priori law

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.200
or a priori of the underlying institution.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.200
And you can see how we're going to have similar modifications

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.200
in the realm of mathematics.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:12.200
All right, now let me try and move quickly

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.200
to get to my...

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.200
I'll put these slides on the...

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.200
on the witty page.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:24.200
All right, so the idea is we have a history of mathematics

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.200
and a history of physics,

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.200
and physics is constantly feeding into the history of mathematics

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.200
to yield new problems.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.200
Mathematic growth,

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:36.200
there will be some offshoots where mathematicians grow

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.200
new kinds of creatures

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:43.200
which are not addressing specific needs of physicists

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.200
or engineers at a given time,

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.200
but they may later prove to be useful.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.200
That's a very common phenomenon

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:52.200
that mathematicians are doing something crazy

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:55.200
that they are doing it for the sake of the beauty

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:58.200
of the entity that they're building,

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.200
but it turns out to have an application

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.200
in the next generation.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:08.200
And this is something of an illustration of that.

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:11.200
But I found this, and as you know,

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:15.200
I like diagrams in the Wikipedia article

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.200
on mathematical physics.

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.200
And of course I like it because it contains

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.200
the word ontology.

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:24.200
Now interestingly, the Wikipedia article

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.200
doesn't mention the word ontology at all,

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:29.200
so I have no idea what they meant.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.200
They just have the diagram,

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:35.200
but there are some things which explain what this means.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.200
So we have mathematics, mathematical physics,

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.200
ontology and physics,

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.200
and in some way we get physics

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.200
by taking mathematical physics and taking ontology

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:48.200
and smashing them together.

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:53.200
And mathematics is somehow feeding into both of those.

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:56.200
And I understand how mathematics is feeding

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:58.200
into mathematical physics.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.200
I don't understand what they might mean by this argument,

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:03.200
but we've got three hundred fours.

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:08.200
Mathematical physics is an approach to physics

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.200
which emphasises mathematical reading,

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.200
that's what they say.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.200
Theoretical physics is an approach to physics

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:19.200
that emphasises observations and experiments.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.200
And so we're interested in mathematical physics

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.200
which is looking at physics

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:31.200
as a structure or an endeavour

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:35.200
which is aiming to utilise the rigor

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:37.200
that you find in mathematics.

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.200
And I could simplify that by saying

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.200
it's going to be using these mathematical structures

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.200
which the mathematicians are inventing.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.200
So mathematical physics is import use application testing

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.200
of mathematical structures to physical phenomena,

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.200
trying to find which mathematical structure fits

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:57.200
a given physical phenomenon.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:00.200
And now we can understand the diagram as follows.

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:03.200
So you start historically with a piece of mathematics

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:06.200
and this might be a model of mathematics

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.200
which is a model of periodic motion

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.200
with constant amplitude

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:12.200
which you can define in purely mathematical terms.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:14.200
And then you add ontology

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:16.200
and I'm going to take that to mean you add reference

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:20.200
to a specific system, in this case the harmonic oscillation term.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:23.200
And specific magnitudes such as force

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:29.200
and so forth and amplitude.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:34.200
And when you add ontology to the mathematics

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:38.200
where the ontology includes pieces of the physics ontology

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:41.200
then you get physics.

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:44.200
So that's just a complicated way of saying that

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.200
physics is the application of mathematics

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.200
to real world phenomena like oscillation.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:55.200
So we finished exactly on time by my law.

01:22:55.200 --> 01:23:00.200
Are there any questions?
