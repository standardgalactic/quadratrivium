WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
And I'm going to be responding to King Ma's presentation.

00:06.400 --> 00:12.880
And we can summarize Elsa Lyne's view as follows.

00:12.880 --> 00:18.000
There is something like a placenta uterine cord

00:18.000 --> 00:21.760
foster, a myriological hole, which

00:21.760 --> 00:25.160
grows directly out of the uterine wall,

00:25.160 --> 00:28.320
just as a tail grows out of the cat.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.200
And I'm quoting the paper, Pregnant Mariology.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.840
Therefore, it follows that the foster,

00:33.840 --> 00:36.400
post-implantation, and prior to birth

00:36.400 --> 00:39.080
is a part of the mother.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.760
She gives various reasons, which, again, I

00:41.760 --> 00:43.840
will explain in due course.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.160
Now, the alternative to this part-to-end view

00:46.160 --> 00:51.360
that she discusses, which is an alternative which I embrace

00:51.360 --> 00:54.760
and which we defended in the 16 days paper,

00:54.760 --> 00:56.720
is called the fetal container view, which

00:56.720 --> 01:00.080
says that the fetus is inside the mother,

01:00.080 --> 01:02.440
but not a part of the mother.

01:02.440 --> 01:09.560
And through her papers, and also at various points

01:09.560 --> 01:11.440
during her presentation today, points

01:11.440 --> 01:14.320
where she tended to raise her voice

01:14.320 --> 01:17.320
and become very passionate.

01:17.320 --> 01:21.880
This fetal container view is, she says,

01:21.880 --> 01:25.400
a view no one has ever argued for.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.840
And she thinks this is a mark against it.

01:27.840 --> 01:34.920
All right, now the chief witness is an octopus, the argonaut.

01:34.920 --> 01:40.800
And what Kingma refers to as its detachable penis.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.680
But actually, if you look at the literature on the argonaut,

01:43.680 --> 01:47.320
it's called a detachable modified arm.

01:47.320 --> 01:50.880
And Kingma, in her way, wanted to see this

01:50.880 --> 01:54.640
as being an archetypical male thing

01:54.640 --> 01:56.920
to worry about detached penises.

01:56.920 --> 02:00.960
But we don't actually worry very much about losing arms.

02:04.120 --> 02:10.320
A hectotillus, it says, is one of the arms of male cephalopods

02:10.320 --> 02:14.480
that is specialized to store and transfer sperm to the female.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.600
And now comes the polite part.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.520
Depending on the species, the male

02:18.520 --> 02:21.600
may use it merely as a conduit to the female,

02:21.600 --> 02:26.920
or he may wrench it off and present it to the female.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.880
If you're an octopus, you can do these things.

02:31.720 --> 02:34.800
The idea is that we can learn something about metaphysics

02:34.800 --> 02:37.040
from the case of the argonaut, namely that there

02:37.040 --> 02:39.800
can be detachable organs.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.840
And the idea would be then that the foster

02:41.840 --> 02:43.080
is a detachable organ.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.760
So it would be like a kidney which

02:44.760 --> 02:46.480
lives the life of its own once it's

02:46.480 --> 02:49.680
been detached from its host.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.720
Kingma holds the view that there are some parts, not organs,

02:52.720 --> 02:58.360
but some parts of the organism, an organism like ourselves,

02:58.360 --> 03:00.400
which do not persist through separation,

03:00.400 --> 03:03.720
such as the heart or the brain, and other parts which

03:03.720 --> 03:06.600
do persist through separation.

03:06.600 --> 03:13.600
And these would include, on her view anyway, the foster,

03:13.600 --> 03:19.120
the fetus embryo baby inside the mother.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.760
I agree that there are some parts which can survive.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.440
Many molecules survive.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.520
In fact, all molecules, I guess, survive in one way or another

03:27.520 --> 03:29.160
that we lose in the course of our lives.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.360
So it's certainly true that there are parts.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.960
The question is whether there are organs,

03:32.960 --> 03:36.000
and the question is whether the foster is

03:36.000 --> 03:40.720
to be regarded under this heading, which can survive

03:40.720 --> 03:43.040
and become what embryos do.

03:43.040 --> 03:46.520
Namely, mature adults, if they're lucky.

03:46.520 --> 03:51.000
When I read Kingma's, sorry, Elsa Lyne's writings

03:51.000 --> 03:55.600
on these matters, she repeatedly cites the paper 16 days.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.280
She only ever cites one sentence, which is a sentence

03:59.280 --> 04:01.760
about a tub of yogurt.

04:01.760 --> 04:06.760
Now, the 16 days fetal container view

04:06.760 --> 04:09.560
is also called the tenant niche view.

04:09.560 --> 04:15.440
We regard the foster as a tenant in the niche which is created

04:15.440 --> 04:18.560
by the mother through the uterus.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.160
We give us some examples of the niche tenant relation,

04:21.160 --> 04:24.000
one of which is the relation between a tub of yogurt

04:24.000 --> 04:26.040
and the inside of your refrigerator.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.920
She suggests that we'd never heard of the umbilical cord

04:28.920 --> 04:31.240
in the placenta when we wrote the paper.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.600
Of course, we'd heard about the fact

04:32.600 --> 04:35.800
that the umbilical cord is connected to the placenta

04:35.800 --> 04:39.640
at one side and is connected to the baby on the other side.

04:39.640 --> 04:45.240
And she says that this means that the foster mother relation

04:45.240 --> 04:49.320
or the foster uterus relation cannot be a niche tenant relation

04:49.320 --> 04:54.760
because the baby shares an external boundary

04:54.760 --> 04:56.800
with the umbilical cord.

04:56.800 --> 05:01.240
She also thinks that given that the placenta has a maternal part

05:01.240 --> 05:04.680
and a fetal part, there must be an overlap

05:04.680 --> 05:08.160
or there must be parts in common between the baby and the fetus.

05:08.160 --> 05:12.600
But that's not true, of course, because the fetal part of the placenta

05:12.600 --> 05:16.360
and the maternal part of the placenta

05:16.360 --> 05:20.120
are two different layers within one of the same organ.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.640
They are separated from each other also

05:22.640 --> 05:24.880
by some liquid or fluid filled cavity

05:24.880 --> 05:28.600
as we will see ad nauseam in the next few minutes.

05:28.600 --> 05:32.280
So it's really only number two, which is a problem,

05:32.280 --> 05:37.600
but it's not a problem if you read the paper.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.000
Now, there are two cases that we need to distinguish.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.440
One is the future baby view,

05:41.440 --> 05:43.840
where we're considering whether the future baby

05:43.840 --> 05:47.280
could be the tenant inside the niche, which is the uterus.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.680
The other is the placenta uterine cord foster view.

05:50.680 --> 05:54.040
So this is the future baby view.

05:54.040 --> 05:57.000
And this is what we said in 16 days.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.240
So the issue, remember, is whether they share an external boundary.

06:02.360 --> 06:06.960
Each substance possesses its own complete connected external boundary

06:06.960 --> 06:10.080
analogous to the service of a sphere or torus.

06:10.080 --> 06:14.880
We are, of course, toruses because of the chest if trapped.

06:14.880 --> 06:18.440
Each substance possesses its own complete connected external boundary,

06:18.440 --> 06:22.040
which divides its interior from its exterior

06:22.040 --> 06:26.480
and at the same time separates it, especially from other substances.

06:26.480 --> 06:31.000
The future baby has its own external boundary.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.960
The mother has her own external boundary.

06:34.960 --> 06:39.800
And on this view, the interior boundary of the uterus

06:39.800 --> 06:43.880
or the amniotic cavity, we'll come back to that later,

06:43.880 --> 06:47.280
is the relevant external boundary,

06:47.280 --> 06:51.360
which is not shared by the fetus.

06:51.360 --> 06:56.080
It's separated by liquid from the fetus.

06:56.080 --> 07:01.320
So because the external boundary very often

07:01.320 --> 07:04.880
will have pores and other gaps and still be an external boundary.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.720
The external boundary is established by a physical covering or membrane

07:08.720 --> 07:15.120
which extends continuously across all or almost all of its surface.

07:15.120 --> 07:18.960
Almost all because typically there are small apertures,

07:18.960 --> 07:22.720
pores, nostrils, your mouth, for instance.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.560
The fact that you have a mouth which has a hole in it

07:25.560 --> 07:28.320
doesn't mean that there is, you don't have an external boundary.

07:28.360 --> 07:32.560
The fact that there are some organisms

07:32.560 --> 07:34.440
which are connected to other entities,

07:34.440 --> 07:40.600
for instance, somebody walking in space is connected to the spaceship,

07:40.600 --> 07:44.200
or somebody inside a spaceship is connected by the spaceship itself

07:44.200 --> 07:46.440
by various tubes and connectors,

07:46.440 --> 07:51.960
doesn't mean that the spaceship and the astronaut

07:51.960 --> 07:54.760
have suddenly become biologically one thing

07:54.760 --> 08:02.560
so that the astronaut would be a part of this unified spaceship astronaut hole.

08:02.560 --> 08:07.200
Nor when somebody is in an ICU,

08:07.200 --> 08:11.760
which has been sealed off from the rest of the environment for immunological reasons,

08:11.760 --> 08:13.560
and is connected by breathing tubes,

08:13.560 --> 08:19.400
does it mean that the patient in the ICU has somehow become part of the ICU

08:19.400 --> 08:22.120
rather than, as we can all see,

08:22.120 --> 08:26.600
standing, or in this case lying, in a niche-tenant relationship

08:26.600 --> 08:30.840
to the niche which is created by the ICU

08:30.840 --> 08:37.160
and to the regulation of the person's oxygen needs and so forth,

08:37.160 --> 08:41.080
which the ICU provides in virtue of the various connectors and tubes

08:41.080 --> 08:44.840
which are connecting to the patient.

08:44.840 --> 08:51.800
Now, it's very easy, well, it's relatively easy to disconnect those tubes.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.200
It's relatively easy to disconnect the tubes even of the astronaut

08:55.200 --> 09:00.280
providing he's careful when, or she is careful when climbing back into the spaceship.

09:00.280 --> 09:07.320
Similarly, it's made easy, not by biology in this case, but by technology.

09:07.320 --> 09:13.200
It's very easy to separate to stamps,

09:13.200 --> 09:16.760
because stamps have perforations.

09:16.760 --> 09:23.200
Now, there are some bodily connections which are similarly easily separated.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.760
For instance, blisters.

09:24.760 --> 09:32.560
The idea that Alphaline has to defend is that when the foster, on one view,

09:32.560 --> 09:36.680
or the foster plus umbilical cord plus placenta on the other view,

09:36.680 --> 09:42.240
leaves the mother, then a substantial change occurs.

09:42.240 --> 09:46.800
Now, in the 16 days paper, we explain at great length what a substantial change is.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.800
Substantial change is not moving location.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.200
It's not changing the things that you're attached to.

09:53.200 --> 09:58.360
It's not being viewed by people in a different way.

09:58.360 --> 10:01.720
So on one day they view you as such and such,

10:01.720 --> 10:04.000
on another day they view you as something else.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.400
It's something which is catastrophic.

10:07.400 --> 10:10.880
Two drops of water merge and flow into one.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.040
An amoeba splits.

10:12.040 --> 10:15.080
A block of marble is split and becomes two.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.400
Or a pair of conjoined twins is separated.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.920
These are big changes.

10:19.920 --> 10:26.160
Moving out of the niche, in other words, becoming born, is not a big change.

10:26.160 --> 10:31.040
It's just moving from one place to another.

10:31.040 --> 10:36.320
So it's like the tenant leaving her apartment or the passenger leaving her car.

10:36.320 --> 10:42.680
On the future baby view, it's not a case of substantial change.

10:42.680 --> 10:47.600
But on the corionic content growing directly out of the uterine world,

10:47.600 --> 10:52.240
just as the tail grows out of the cat, it does look catastrophic.

10:52.240 --> 10:58.800
It does look as if it could be a case like a block of marble splitting into two.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.080
There's a lot of blood.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.440
It's painful.

11:01.440 --> 11:06.760
And so Elsa-Lyne argues that we are dealing here with a real boundary

11:06.760 --> 11:14.360
and that breaking of the breaking of which we bring about a substantial change.

11:14.360 --> 11:18.720
And so she uses the argument that because of the blood,

11:18.720 --> 11:24.720
it's more like separating the tail from a cat, which is not a non-trivial break.

11:24.720 --> 11:28.960
It's not like tearing two stamps down the perforation.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.520
It's something much more substantial than that.

11:31.520 --> 11:36.560
In the normal case, in fact, the placenta does detach easily.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.320
There's a lot of blood, but then there's a lot of blood in menstruation, too.

11:40.320 --> 11:44.200
If there is a problem in detaching the placenta,

11:44.200 --> 11:48.480
and thereby also in detaching the umbilical cord from the mother,

11:48.480 --> 11:50.440
that's because there is something abnormal.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.160
It's because something's gone wrong.

11:52.160 --> 11:56.760
It's a mark of something going wrong that the placenta doesn't detach easily.

11:56.760 --> 12:01.120
Normally, it detaches easily with a lot of blood.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.760
All right, so this is how it looks.

12:03.760 --> 12:11.280
There is the future vein connected to the placenta via the umbilical cord,

12:11.280 --> 12:13.800
which is connected in terms of the placenta.

12:13.800 --> 12:17.320
There is a fetal part of the placenta.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.440
There's a maternal part of the placenta.

12:19.440 --> 12:24.160
And there is a perforation kind of boundary here, not a fiat boundary,

12:24.160 --> 12:27.240
which would imply no physical discontinuity,

12:27.240 --> 12:30.320
but a bona fide boundary because the lining of the uterus

12:30.320 --> 12:36.400
is a physical discontinuity as between the placenta and the mother.

12:36.400 --> 12:42.200
My idea with the niche-tenant relation or the tenant-niche relation

12:42.200 --> 12:48.520
is captured rather conveniently in a series of papers and articles

12:48.520 --> 12:50.160
about the microbiome.

12:50.200 --> 12:54.920
So 100 trillion good bacteria call the human body home.

12:54.920 --> 12:58.120
They are all standing to the human body in the tenant-niche relation.

12:58.120 --> 12:58.960
They're all tenants.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.720
Some of them are friendly tenants.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.880
Some of them are pathogen, and we want to get rid of them.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.320
The baby is like that.

13:06.320 --> 13:12.600
So we need to understand what it is to be in your home.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.040
And that's a very complicated relation.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.520
One of the argument strategies which Elsa Lyne uses

13:18.520 --> 13:21.720
is to suggest that by viewing the relationship between the baby

13:21.720 --> 13:24.240
and the mother as a niche-tenant relation,

13:24.240 --> 13:26.800
we are making it sound much too simple.

13:26.800 --> 13:30.480
We're neglecting all the processes of regulation,

13:30.480 --> 13:33.000
many of which are catered for by the placenta,

13:33.000 --> 13:34.760
which, as she quite rightly points out,

13:34.760 --> 13:37.640
is an amazingly sophisticated organ.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.680
All those processes of regulation are in operation

13:40.680 --> 13:43.360
precisely on the tenant-niche view,

13:43.360 --> 13:45.960
just as they're in operation in your apartment,

13:45.960 --> 13:48.720
regulating the temperature of the air,

13:48.720 --> 13:52.600
regulating the availability of water and electricity

13:52.600 --> 13:55.160
and internet connections, and so forth.

13:55.160 --> 14:00.120
So a home, whether it be the home of the baby inside the mother

14:00.120 --> 14:03.960
or whether it be the home of the tenant inside its apartment,

14:03.960 --> 14:08.760
is a regulated environment with all kinds of functional connections

14:08.760 --> 14:13.800
to the outside world through all kinds of engineered equipment.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.600
And so these are some examples of engineered equipment.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.920
They all have functions, and they're all part of the home.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.440
They're part of the home because they are functionally connected

14:23.440 --> 14:25.280
to the workings of the home.

14:25.280 --> 14:28.120
And the workings of the home may include also security.

14:28.120 --> 14:36.000
So the reason why the amnion, the structure which houses

14:36.000 --> 14:38.360
the tenant we call the baby, is so complicated

14:38.360 --> 14:43.360
is because it's serving the purpose of keeping the baby safe.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.200
That's why there are so many layers.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.240
I'm back to the ICU again.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.920
So your body houses 10 times more bacteria than cells.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.000
Your body is home.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.160
So these are all indications everywhere

14:56.160 --> 14:58.200
in the biological literature of the niche tenant

14:58.200 --> 15:02.760
relation as applied to bodies and things like bacteria.

15:02.760 --> 15:05.480
And you find it also in the literature on gynecology

15:05.480 --> 15:06.600
all over the place.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.360
Else the line just didn't see it.

15:08.360 --> 15:13.280
Trillions upon trillions of tiny passengers, bacteria,

15:13.280 --> 15:15.320
when the baby gets out of the womb,

15:15.320 --> 15:17.920
it's like a passenger getting out of the car.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.800
It's not a substantial change.

15:19.800 --> 15:26.200
It's a painful operation, but it's not a substantial change.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.240
So what makes a part?

15:27.240 --> 15:29.920
First of all, we're interested in parts

15:29.920 --> 15:34.400
on the inside of the organism, like the tub of yogurt

15:34.400 --> 15:34.880
in the roof.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.080
Being connected is not good enough.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.320
You could have the refrigerator magnets which

15:40.320 --> 15:42.840
are connected to your fridge, but that wouldn't make them parts

15:42.840 --> 15:43.520
of the fridge.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.920
In fact, you can be a part of the fridge

15:47.920 --> 15:48.960
without being connected.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.400
There can be movable parts of the fridge.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.240
What makes a part most importantly is having a function.

15:54.240 --> 16:00.360
And Elsa Lyne sort of understood that in her way a bit.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.720
She didn't provide a definition of function.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.640
And we provided a definition of function

16:04.640 --> 16:05.920
which you can look at here.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.640
And it would be interesting if people

16:07.640 --> 16:11.320
have counter examples of entities with functions which

16:11.320 --> 16:14.160
do not satisfy this definition.

16:14.160 --> 16:18.600
Basically, what it says is that an object Y has a function

16:18.600 --> 16:21.880
means it has a disposition in virtue of the way

16:21.880 --> 16:23.880
it's built physically.

16:23.880 --> 16:26.880
And that entity came into existence

16:26.880 --> 16:28.680
through historical processes which

16:28.680 --> 16:34.000
selected for entities capable of realizing that disposition.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
And there are two ways that can happen.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.880
One is intentional design for artifacts

16:38.880 --> 16:41.160
like refrigerators and motor cars.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.320
And the other is evolutionary selection

16:44.320 --> 16:46.200
for biological entities.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.880
I don't know of any other way in which functional, sorry,

16:49.880 --> 16:52.600
in which entities with functions come into existence.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.520
So two of that kinds of things have functions, artifacts,

16:55.520 --> 16:57.760
and the component parts of artifacts,

16:57.760 --> 16:59.600
and parts of organisms.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.760
I do not believe that organisms have functions

17:02.760 --> 17:06.760
unless you believe in slavery or unless you

17:06.760 --> 17:10.760
follow Richard Dawkins and thinks that we are just

17:10.760 --> 17:14.120
the functional artifacts created by genes in order

17:14.120 --> 17:16.960
to propagate themselves through the universe.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.080
I don't accept them, either of those.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.480
So I can't think of any other reasons why organisms

17:21.480 --> 17:22.280
could be functions.

17:22.280 --> 17:27.840
Any organisms, whether bacteria or human beings.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.520
It could be that we manufacture bacteria

17:30.520 --> 17:32.680
and that we create artifact, and then they

17:32.680 --> 17:34.480
would have functions because we designed them

17:34.480 --> 17:37.840
for a certain purpose, to perform a certain function.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.400
But I can't think of any other ways

17:39.400 --> 17:41.800
in which biological entities can have functions other

17:41.800 --> 17:44.080
than being parts of organisms.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.120
Your heart has a function.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.160
Your kidney has a function.

17:47.160 --> 17:50.520
Your baby doesn't have a function because it's an organism.

17:50.520 --> 17:53.480
Therefore, your baby is not part of an organism

17:53.480 --> 17:57.680
because it doesn't satisfy that has a function relation.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.560
Now, in fact, what makes a part in the biological case

18:00.560 --> 18:02.040
is much more complicated.

18:02.080 --> 18:05.400
And that we could divide it into two questions, namely,

18:05.400 --> 18:08.440
the part question for small molecules.

18:08.440 --> 18:12.280
So banana molecules, when you've half digested a banana.

18:12.280 --> 18:15.400
Are the banana molecules parts of you or not?

18:15.400 --> 18:17.040
That's a very difficult kind of question.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.600
There are many questions like that which are difficult.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.800
Fortunately, we're interested in parthood

18:21.800 --> 18:25.840
for large granularity entities like fetuses,

18:25.840 --> 18:29.000
even very small fetuses, are much larger than small molecules.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.160
And so we can make progress here.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.960
In the biological case,

18:32.960 --> 18:35.960
being on the inside is clearly not enough again.

18:35.960 --> 18:39.040
So a bullet inside your body is not part of your body.

18:39.040 --> 18:43.200
Being connected is not so relevant.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.480
So all the parts of your organism are indeed connected

18:46.480 --> 18:49.760
to the other parts except for blood cells.

18:49.760 --> 18:54.320
Blood cells are the only freely moving parts of your body.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.840
They're parts.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.760
And all biologists accepts the blood cells

18:58.760 --> 19:00.280
as parts of your body.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.480
So what makes a part?

19:01.480 --> 19:03.480
Well, it can't be having a function either

19:03.480 --> 19:06.000
because prostheses have functions,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.280
but prostheses are not parts.

19:08.280 --> 19:12.000
Hair satisfies the criterion of having a function

19:12.000 --> 19:14.440
whose realization is necessary

19:14.440 --> 19:16.120
for the host's continued existence,

19:16.120 --> 19:18.520
or at least did originally satisfy that function

19:18.520 --> 19:22.040
before we had home heating and air conditioning and so forth.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.520
Microbiota are not parts.

19:25.520 --> 19:28.560
The embryo is not a part if the embryo is an organism.

19:28.560 --> 19:32.160
So could the embryo be something like an organ of the mother

19:32.160 --> 19:34.720
so that it could satisfy this criterion?

19:34.720 --> 19:36.880
Because an organ has a function.

19:36.880 --> 19:40.520
In fact, that's part of the definition of what an organ is.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.320
For Elsa Lyne to get her way,

19:43.320 --> 19:46.360
we have to find a way of recognizing

19:46.360 --> 19:48.760
that the embryo has a function

19:48.760 --> 19:51.360
and so that it can be an organ of the mother.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.520
It has to be a function which contributes

19:53.520 --> 19:56.640
to the mother's continued existence or something like that.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.360
In her talk today, Elsa Lyne told us

19:59.360 --> 20:03.240
what the function of the foster is.

20:03.240 --> 20:07.800
And I think this is the weakest point in her entire book.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.200
It says the function of the foster

20:09.200 --> 20:12.240
is to perform the reproductive function of the crevita.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.400
Now, I don't think this makes sense.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.920
I don't think it makes sense to say

20:15.920 --> 20:17.840
that the function of one entity

20:17.840 --> 20:20.040
is to perform the function of another entity.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.200
The whole point of having a function

20:22.200 --> 20:23.800
is that you have to perform it.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.240
All of these things are things which have functions.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.280
Of their own.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.640
So what she said is a bit like saying,

20:30.640 --> 20:33.000
the function of this biscuit is to enable

20:33.000 --> 20:36.720
the performance of the cooking function of my stove

20:36.720 --> 20:38.160
or of my chef.

20:38.160 --> 20:41.520
Or the function of this gash is to enable the performance

20:41.520 --> 20:43.720
of the slashing function of my scimitar.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.720
Or the function of this engine air filter

20:46.720 --> 20:48.760
is to enable the performance

20:48.760 --> 20:51.840
of the engineering function of the automobile engineer.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.960
It just doesn't make sense.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.680
But there is a fourth criterion

20:55.680 --> 20:57.920
because we saw processes have functions

20:57.920 --> 20:59.600
which contribute to the realization

20:59.600 --> 21:01.920
of the goals of the host,

21:01.920 --> 21:03.880
but they are not parts of the host.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.480
In order to be a part in the biological sense,

21:06.480 --> 21:09.480
the entity in question has to be generated

21:09.480 --> 21:13.880
by the coordinated expression of the organism's own genes.

21:13.880 --> 21:18.560
And that's a standard thesis from standard anatomy.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.040
That's how they work out

21:20.040 --> 21:22.960
what the anatomical parts of the organism are.

21:22.960 --> 21:26.880
I'll give you cloned embryos elsewhere.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.040
But all other embryos are on this criterion,

21:30.040 --> 21:31.880
not parts of the mother

21:31.880 --> 21:33.920
because they are not expressions

21:33.920 --> 21:36.720
of the mother's own genes.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.640
All right, so the reason why no one ever argued

21:38.640 --> 21:40.200
for the fetal container view

21:40.200 --> 21:42.400
is the same as the reason why no one ever argued

21:42.400 --> 21:44.600
for the view that two plus two equals four.

21:44.600 --> 21:45.520
It's obvious.

21:45.520 --> 21:48.000
And the reason why it's obvious to all biologists

21:48.000 --> 21:52.520
is because all biologists know what mammals are.

21:53.520 --> 21:57.960
Amniota, which comes from the Greek for lamb.

21:57.960 --> 22:02.960
And it means an organism that lays its eggs on land

22:03.760 --> 22:07.240
or retains the fertilized egg within the mother.

22:07.240 --> 22:11.720
So the key to understanding where else the line went wrong

22:11.720 --> 22:12.920
is the egg.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.480
All amniota are characterized by having an egg

22:15.480 --> 22:19.720
which is equipped with an amnios or membrane.

22:19.720 --> 22:22.760
And the membrane is going to be a multi-layered membrane

22:22.760 --> 22:25.080
which enables certain kinds of exchange

22:25.080 --> 22:29.760
between the outside and the inside, protects the baby.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.840
And in mammals such as humans,

22:32.840 --> 22:35.120
these membranes include the amniotic sac

22:35.120 --> 22:36.280
that surrounds the fetus.

22:36.280 --> 22:39.480
So the amniotic sac is the niche

22:39.480 --> 22:41.280
and the fetus is the tenant.

22:42.360 --> 22:45.540
The chicken is the tenant, the egg,

22:45.540 --> 22:48.860
the interior of the egg is the niche.

22:48.860 --> 22:50.060
So this is where we are.

22:50.060 --> 22:54.060
We are amniota, these are the chordates.

22:55.180 --> 22:57.260
There are many, many other chordates,

22:57.260 --> 23:01.420
but we are here in the amniotic part of the chordates.

23:02.460 --> 23:05.820
And amniota include mammals,

23:05.820 --> 23:07.620
but they include all kinds of other stuff,

23:07.620 --> 23:12.020
including turtles and crocodiles and all birds.

23:12.020 --> 23:14.220
They lay eggs, remember, just like we do.

23:14.220 --> 23:18.300
So this is the anatomy of an amniotic egg.

23:18.340 --> 23:23.340
There are 15 parts and this is a crocodile egg.

23:23.380 --> 23:24.580
I didn't count them up,

23:24.580 --> 23:26.900
but the yolk sac and the yolk are pretty obvious

23:26.900 --> 23:28.460
and they're going to be present in every egg.

23:28.460 --> 23:31.020
And remember that the chicken egg is covered in many pores

23:31.020 --> 23:33.620
which enable the chicken to breathe.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.820
Still has an external boundary.

23:37.820 --> 23:39.460
In amniotes that lay eggs,

23:39.460 --> 23:41.700
the shell of the egg provides protection

23:41.700 --> 23:45.380
while being permeable to allow oxygen exchange in mammals.

23:46.260 --> 23:48.100
Membranes that are homologous,

23:48.100 --> 23:51.740
that means they have a common evolutionary ancestor

23:51.740 --> 23:55.580
to the extra embryonic membranes in eggs

23:55.580 --> 23:57.620
are present in the placenta.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.220
So that's humans, that's reptiles and birds.

24:01.220 --> 24:03.140
It's the same thing.

24:04.140 --> 24:06.500
They're both a niche with a tenant.

24:06.500 --> 24:11.500
One's inside the mother, one's outside the mother, laid.

24:11.660 --> 24:13.900
The placenta is a fantastic organ.

24:14.780 --> 24:16.500
It allows exchange of matter.

24:18.980 --> 24:22.900
So that's the placenta and these are all amniota

24:23.780 --> 24:24.900
and I rest my case.

24:27.260 --> 24:28.100
Be careful.
