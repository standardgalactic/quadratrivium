00:00.000 --> 00:12.240
I'm talking today about phenomenology. Now, today in my professional life, I spend a lot

00:12.240 --> 00:19.040
of time doing formal ontology, which is very closely related to a non-phenomenological kind

00:19.040 --> 00:25.200
of philosophy called the analytic philosophy, logical philosophy. For a long time in my life,

00:25.200 --> 00:30.640
I work on phenomenology. And this is what this is about. And so it has a kind of,

00:31.920 --> 00:38.720
I wouldn't say oldy-worldy flavor, although it does go back 50 years. But it does deal with some

00:38.720 --> 00:46.240
of the reasons why my life progressed phenomenologically as it did. So it started with the very first

00:46.240 --> 00:50.880
philosophy book that I had in my hands in school, which was Wittgenstein's Traptators.

00:51.600 --> 00:57.520
I was about to go to university to study mathematics. Wittgenstein's Traptators convinced

00:57.520 --> 01:03.040
me that I should study mathematics and philosophy. And I did this in Oxford for three years. So

01:04.080 --> 01:08.960
I was at Jesus College, which is somewhere at the back there. I was there for three years as an

01:08.960 --> 01:14.960
undergraduate. And the one person who really influenced me was Michael Dumit, who is a specialist

01:14.960 --> 01:22.480
on Frege and on a view of analytic philosophy, as rooted not just in Frege's ideas, but in

01:22.480 --> 01:29.040
the idea that studying language could be the key tool to unlock philosophical problems.

01:29.040 --> 01:37.280
And during my stay in Oxford, I had dreams of writing a PhD. My goal was to write a PhD on

01:38.320 --> 01:44.000
the aesthetics of mathematics. So the idea would be that mathematical theorems

01:44.000 --> 01:49.600
or chess games or musical works can have aesthetic properties. I did end up writing

01:49.600 --> 01:57.040
a PhD thesis, but it was about something quite different. And my change came about by accident.

01:57.040 --> 02:03.120
Roman Ingaarden was the key and this book changed my plans. All right, then I moved to the University

02:03.120 --> 02:08.320
of Manchester, which is where I lived, and which was the only place in England at that time where

02:08.400 --> 02:14.480
you could study phenomenology. I was a student working, well, on my thesis, which is called

02:15.600 --> 02:21.600
I used a typewriter. If I made any mistakes, I had to write out top copy and the carbon copy.

02:22.320 --> 02:28.960
It's 600 and something pages long. I didn't know what hellish waste of time I was going through

02:28.960 --> 02:36.000
because we didn't have computers in those days. And it's about Hossel, Frege, Dumit and Mino.

02:36.640 --> 02:42.560
But it's about ontology in the classical philosophical sense. It's about how these people

02:42.560 --> 02:51.040
study beings, entities formally. And during that time, I met two philosophers, philosophy students

02:51.920 --> 02:57.920
who were also doing a PhD in Manchester at the same time. Peter Simons became quite famous

02:58.560 --> 03:05.840
in various universities. He finished in Trinity College, Dublin. And Kevin finished and hasn't

03:06.240 --> 03:12.800
quite finished yet in the University of Geneva. So all right, this is Manchester. After my PhD,

03:12.800 --> 03:19.280
I moved to a postdoc in another Northern English University. And then I moved back to Manchester

03:19.280 --> 03:26.960
as a faculty member. I inherited the position of my PhD supervisor who retired. So I was responsible

03:26.960 --> 03:32.960
for phenomenology in the philosophy department in Manchester, which was very much dominated

03:32.960 --> 03:39.520
by what we might call American. Americans are of two types. On the one hand, there are Americans

03:40.080 --> 03:44.320
who do American philosophy. And then on the other hand, there are English people who do

03:44.320 --> 03:51.840
American philosophy. I was the only person doing philosophy in a European sense. So Peter and

03:51.840 --> 03:56.400
Kevin and I published a lot together. We worked a lot together. We organized many meetings together

03:56.400 --> 04:02.320
and we changed the world. This was one of the papers which was quite successful and still

04:02.320 --> 04:10.160
successful that there's a whole industry of truth making, which we more or less initiated in 1984.

04:10.160 --> 04:17.280
And on my door in the philosophy department in Manchester, I had this sign that to indicate that

04:17.280 --> 04:21.680
you were now going into the world of European philosophy. This comes from the Berlin Wall.

04:21.680 --> 04:27.280
I guess you all know what the Berlin Wall is. Checkpoints, Darley and all that. The centre

04:27.360 --> 04:33.040
of all of this work with Peter and Kevin was not in Garden, but in Garden's teacher,

04:33.040 --> 04:40.880
Husser, who was the founder of phenomenology and who was born in Austria, Hungary. And a lot of the

04:40.880 --> 04:50.640
work I did subsequently between 1990 and 2000 or 1918, 2000, was it about Austro-Hungarian philosophy,

04:51.360 --> 04:57.120
including Husser. Normally counted as a German philosophy because he spent his mature life in

04:57.120 --> 05:02.880
Germany, but he was born in Austria-Hungary and like many of the other people I'm going to talk

05:02.880 --> 05:07.920
about, even the Poles I'm going to talk about, they were born in Austria too and they were certainly

05:07.920 --> 05:15.920
not part of Poland because Poland didn't exist. All right, so formal ontology. The term comes from

05:15.920 --> 05:21.600
Husser's logical investigations and both Peter and Kevin and I thought that Husser's logical

05:21.600 --> 05:28.080
investigations and specifically the logical investigation number three on the theory of

05:28.080 --> 05:33.040
holes and parts was the key to doing good philosophy. So we thought that many of the

05:33.600 --> 05:41.040
targets of analytic philosophy were important to work on, but the proper method was to be found

05:41.040 --> 05:49.040
in Husser. So this is the first formal theory of myriology, theory of parts and parts. And more

05:49.040 --> 05:55.200
generally, it presents something called formal ontology, which is the theory of ontological

05:55.200 --> 06:02.160
structures, which are formal in the sense that they are domain neutral, not material in the

06:02.160 --> 06:09.200
sense of being related to matter, but material in the sense of being domain, non-neutral, domain

06:09.200 --> 06:18.560
specific. And relations like part whole, instance of, and so forth, are formal relations. All right,

06:18.560 --> 06:24.000
so these are the main parts of Husser's formal ontology. He was very keen on the idea of a theory

06:24.000 --> 06:32.400
of dependence relations and theories of boundaries and continuities, topology, and then theories of

06:32.400 --> 06:38.000
instantiation of species and lowest specific differences and so forth. So this is pretty

06:38.000 --> 06:44.480
old fashioned in the sense that most of it is found in some form in Aristotle. But Husser

06:45.840 --> 06:51.520
saw, and Husser was originally a mathematician, saw that you could treat these kinds of issues

06:52.080 --> 06:59.520
in a formal way in the sense of that mathematics also is formed. So formal logic, formal ontology,

07:00.080 --> 07:05.360
and formal axiology, which Husser also dealt with, are all very much related to mathematics.

07:08.320 --> 07:18.880
30 years later, probably in Italy, but that's neither here nor there, I created something

07:18.880 --> 07:25.600
called basic formal ontology. And this has become very important. This is what I work on

07:25.600 --> 07:32.240
all the time now. And this includes all of the things that Husser thought were important parts

07:32.240 --> 07:40.960
of formal ontology, together with a much more specific treatment of spacetime of processes

07:40.960 --> 07:45.920
and of what we call realizable entities, which means dispositions, powers, functions, roles,

07:45.920 --> 07:51.680
and so forth. So basic formal ontology is very much rooted in Husser's logical investigations,

07:52.320 --> 07:58.080
and it adds these particular ingredients. The idea is to create a top level ontology,

07:58.080 --> 08:06.000
which will not merely be domain neutral, but will be domain all encompassing. In other words,

08:06.000 --> 08:16.160
every formal ontological need of any ontology will be met by BFO. I don't claim that is the case yet,

08:16.160 --> 08:24.080
but it will be the case maybe in 50 years. So it's hard work. All right, so we have formal ontology,

08:24.080 --> 08:29.120
which deals with the interconnections of things, and we have formal logic, which deals with the

08:29.120 --> 08:34.800
interconnections of truths. And that too corresponds broadly with Husser's account of the relation.

08:34.800 --> 08:41.760
He was not always clear when he was using the word formal to distinguish formal ontology and

08:41.760 --> 08:51.200
formal logic. But this corresponds to the view, the general view, who is presenting in the logical

08:51.200 --> 08:58.720
investigations. And so these are ontological structures. So that's John and that's Mary,

08:58.720 --> 09:03.200
and they are independent entities. So they're not dependent on anything else,

09:03.200 --> 09:09.280
in the sense of dependent, which Husser was talking about. But they are in love with each other.

09:09.280 --> 09:18.560
And so there is a relational quality of love, which is symmetric, which is one-sidedly dependent

09:18.640 --> 09:28.400
on John and one-sidedly dependent on Mary. And we represent that in this way. So dependent entities

09:28.400 --> 09:34.080
have dotted lines and independent entities have solid lines and relations that are captured

09:34.720 --> 09:42.000
representationally by using single lines connecting boxes. And here we see two kinds of relations.

09:42.000 --> 09:50.000
Dependence relations are what we can think of as thin relations, and love and hate and

09:51.040 --> 09:59.280
marriage and magnetic attraction are thick relations. They have empirical properties of

09:59.280 --> 10:06.000
various sorts. And there is a third kind of relation, which are comparative, such as being

10:06.000 --> 10:13.360
taller than. But in any case, there's more than one kind of relation. In predicate logic, of course,

10:13.360 --> 10:20.080
people don't realize that. And so one of the activities that we engaged in during this period

10:20.080 --> 10:24.640
was attacking analytic philosophers because they thought that predicate logic gave you a key

10:25.600 --> 10:33.280
to creating a mirror of the universe. And they got it wrong. Husser and Aristotle came closer

10:33.280 --> 10:40.560
to getting it wrong. All right, so that's a relation. And then we can have also two-sided

10:40.560 --> 10:46.000
mutual dependence. And well, we'll give some examples of this later on. But you can see how

10:46.000 --> 10:51.840
these kinds of diagrams can grow to deal with more complicated entities. Maybe this is the

10:51.840 --> 11:02.320
marriage bond between John and Mary. And then Mary has a claim on John and John has an obligation

11:02.320 --> 11:07.680
to marry that kind of thing. Then the claim and the obligation will be mutually dependent.

11:07.680 --> 11:13.520
We'll come back to these things later on. And then we can illustrate part-whole relations. So love

11:13.520 --> 11:20.320
may include going on holiday. You go on holiday together. And that would be a part of the general

11:20.320 --> 11:24.560
relation of love in this particular case, although that example is not a very good one.

11:25.200 --> 11:34.720
All right. So now we get to the structure of the universe. So Husser's idea is that there are

11:34.720 --> 11:41.920
relations which we find in the universe, which are essential relations. Now, again, Aristotle saw

11:41.920 --> 11:49.600
this story. This is not really anything new. But dependence relations are essential relations

11:49.600 --> 11:56.320
in this sense. And there are laws of essence which capture these necessary relations. And

11:56.320 --> 12:05.600
dependence between the love of John for Mary and John is an essential relation. A love cannot exist

12:05.600 --> 12:14.320
without a lover, a subject. That's an essential relation called necessitation. If love exists,

12:14.320 --> 12:20.960
then there is some lover, not necessarily to, but in the happy instances, then it will go in both

12:20.960 --> 12:30.800
worlds. To say that love is compatible with kindness is to express an essential relation. To say that

12:30.800 --> 12:37.440
love is incompatible with plotting to murder is another example, maybe one of these essential

12:37.440 --> 12:43.840
relations. And similar, that means that love excludes plotting to murder. So we have here some,

12:43.840 --> 12:49.920
again, not very good examples of laws of essence. And this is going to play an important role in

12:49.920 --> 12:57.040
the whole of phenomenology. And Kit Van, who is the world's greatest living metaphysician.

12:57.760 --> 13:08.240
All right. So all of this is being represented, practiced, formulated in German. And so we have

13:08.240 --> 13:13.600
a very important word, Vesens zusammen, which means something like essential structure or

13:13.600 --> 13:19.520
essential configuration. And Vesens Gazette, which means essential law, that we are interested in

13:19.520 --> 13:27.200
the Vesens zusammen, Hinger, the essential structures. And we don't call them essential

13:27.200 --> 13:33.200
structures. When I say we know, I need your slant paper myself, we're working on mathematics and

13:33.200 --> 13:40.240
physics ontology. There are essential structures in those domains. But we, the word, if the phrase

13:40.240 --> 13:46.400
essential structure doesn't work quite so well, as reasons to them, particularly if you're German.

13:47.360 --> 13:52.960
All right. Now, so we have formal ontological relations like dependence. And we also have

13:52.960 --> 14:00.800
formal ontological categories, which correspond to material ontological categories or domain

14:00.800 --> 14:08.640
specific categories such as rabbit or mammal or cell. But they're all formal. And these are the

14:08.640 --> 14:15.440
main examples mentioned by Husser, object state affairs and so on. And you can put these together

14:15.520 --> 14:21.520
in law governed ways. For instance, you can create object aggregates, or you can create

14:21.520 --> 14:26.480
states of affairs by taking an object in the property. You say the property

14:27.760 --> 14:31.600
of this object or this object has this property, that is a state of affairs.

14:34.720 --> 14:42.480
So now formal ontology is like formal logic. Once we've grasped a formal structure in one

14:42.480 --> 14:48.480
instance, we have grasped it for every instance. That's why logic is so powerful. That's why

14:48.480 --> 14:54.320
mathematics is so powerful. Formal ontology is similarly powerful. That's why BFO is so powerful.

14:55.280 --> 15:04.400
And we've, we ain't seen nothing yet. All right, now compare it as the epic, and this is a phrase from

15:05.920 --> 15:10.560
Husser, if the relevant formal ontology has been worked out, then all deductive theoretical work

15:10.560 --> 15:14.960
in the building up of all actual theories in the same form has been done.

15:16.880 --> 15:27.440
So I've said that, and we've said that, and we've said that. And now we can, we come to definitions.

15:27.440 --> 15:34.080
Now Husser, Aristotle had an idea of definitions. And we have to remember that all sciences,

15:34.880 --> 15:41.360
including the science of definitions are perfect to the extent that Aristotle treated

15:41.360 --> 15:48.800
of them. So here Bonaventure is just explicating what Aristotle would have said. If we want a

15:48.800 --> 15:58.320
definition, we want to explicate the meanings of terms. And we succeed when the intellect can use

15:58.400 --> 16:05.360
the definition to grasp, comprehend what a thing is. In other words, what type of thing a thing is.

16:06.320 --> 16:12.960
But definitions are constructed by use, using more universal terms. So a cat is an object,

16:12.960 --> 16:20.560
which is a mammal, which is, I don't, which meow, I don't know. A human is a, a substance,

16:20.560 --> 16:26.800
which is an animal and disruption. We always go to a higher level to form, make a definition.

16:26.800 --> 16:34.880
This was the rule for making definitions in terms of the, including genus, plus the specific

16:34.880 --> 16:42.160
difference, which makes the term you're defining refer to those things which fall under the term,

16:42.160 --> 16:48.240
the species term rather than the genus term. So what makes a human different from an animal is

16:48.240 --> 16:52.640
that the human has a specific difference in being rationed, according to Aristotle,

16:52.640 --> 17:00.000
in some places, in other places he has a different stroke. So, but definitions are

17:00.000 --> 17:05.520
constructed by use, using more universal terms. And these are defined by still more universal

17:05.520 --> 17:12.160
terms until we come to the highest and most universal. And we can't define that because

17:12.160 --> 17:18.560
we're already at the top. And this is where, this is where the top was for Aristotle. And this is

17:18.640 --> 17:26.880
where the top and basic formal ontology is, is, is named after this passage in the third logic

17:26.880 --> 17:33.120
of investigation where he'll sell was the first person ever to use the phrase formal ontology.

17:33.120 --> 17:41.840
So this is where the top ends really. This is, this is Aristotle plus some more things. This is

17:42.800 --> 17:51.200
one quarter of BFO minus all the relations. All right, and this is the ISO standard. Aristotle

17:51.200 --> 17:57.440
didn't get to the point where he had an ISO standard. All right, these are now some of the

17:57.440 --> 18:03.680
examples of the some 400 or so domain ontologies, which are defined into domain specific ontologies

18:03.680 --> 18:09.760
defined in the Saint Blaine adventure Aristotelian way on the basis of BFO.

18:11.040 --> 18:17.520
And the mental functioning ontology takes BFO and then adds more terms in roughly this kind of way.

18:18.160 --> 18:24.560
The emotion ontology takes the mental functioning ontology and adds yet more terms to create an

18:24.560 --> 18:32.320
ontology of the different aspects of emotions, not kinds, but aspects, because every emotion

18:32.320 --> 18:37.760
involves a physiological response, every emotion involves an emotional action tendency and so

18:38.720 --> 18:45.600
and these are some examples of these aspects of emotions in the emotional ontology. So

18:46.320 --> 18:54.960
muscles becoming tense or feeling weak and sweating. So all right, now, so we've had this

18:55.680 --> 19:02.720
all of this was happening in Germany, to some degree in Austria, as we will see later,

19:03.360 --> 19:11.120
some degree even in Poland during the 1900s to 1930, but already much earlier parallel

19:11.840 --> 19:16.480
things were going on in Austria. And I wrote a book about some of these things

19:17.440 --> 19:25.840
in the realm of economics. And there are quite close relations between Austrian philosophy on the

19:25.840 --> 19:31.760
one hand, and Austrian economics, partly because some of them lived in the same building or had

19:31.760 --> 19:37.840
cousins who were married to each other. All right, no, the cousins were not married. All right.

19:39.040 --> 19:43.200
So Karl Manger was the founder of a school called the Austrian School of Economics,

19:43.200 --> 19:48.880
which still exists today. There are still whole sections of economics departments,

19:48.880 --> 19:54.960
for instance, in New York University, which are devoted to this school. It's meant to be a counter

19:54.960 --> 20:02.480
to the Keynesian classical or neoclassical schools of economics. And the original versions of

20:02.480 --> 20:08.960
Austrian economics were about laws of essence or reasons, because that's in the realm of economics.

20:09.760 --> 20:17.680
And this is an example. A good exists only if simultaneously we have a need, a causal connection

20:17.680 --> 20:22.800
to the satisfaction of this need, a knowledge of this causal connection, and a command over the

20:22.800 --> 20:30.160
theme sufficient to direct it to satisfy the need. And Manger wrote whole books based upon this kind

20:30.160 --> 20:37.040
of essential analysis, which is an analysis of part whole relations as well as dependence

20:37.040 --> 20:45.200
relations. So it's very much in the spirit of Hossel. So the goal of research in economics can

20:45.200 --> 20:49.920
only be the determination of the general essence and the general connection of economic phenomena.

20:49.920 --> 20:54.000
And these essences are things like buying, selling, ordering, contracting, and so forth.

20:55.280 --> 21:02.560
And in the 20th century, Ludwig von Mises became even more famous than Manger.

21:02.960 --> 21:12.640
He thought that all of economics could be captured in one single axiom, which is the axiom

21:12.640 --> 21:19.600
man acts. And if you know what acting is, then you know everything about preferences and so forth.

21:20.400 --> 21:28.160
And I don't think that Mises was quite right. But I think that the a prioristic view of economics

21:28.720 --> 21:34.720
has a lot to be said in its favor. And I tried to express these things in this paper.

21:37.200 --> 21:44.800
Murray Rothbard was a famous third generation member of this school. And he actually wrote a

21:44.800 --> 21:49.920
very kind and friendly review of the book on Austrian philosophy, which I showed you.

21:50.720 --> 21:57.520
And then there is Hermann Hoppe, who is a very interesting strange case.

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
I don't think I'm going to tell any jokes about Hermann Hoppe. Although I like him,

22:06.000 --> 22:11.520
he's a nice man, but there are too many things you can make jokes about. So one of his books is

22:11.600 --> 22:18.320
A Defensive Monarchy, which is, of course, correct, but you shouldn't say that. All right, now

22:20.960 --> 22:27.280
what we're really interested in is something which I call the Munich-Gertingen-Krakow school.

22:27.280 --> 22:31.760
And it's sometimes just called a Munich school. If you're being really clever, it's called the

22:31.760 --> 22:39.200
Munich-Gertingen school. But I call it the Munich-Gertingen-Krakow school or Krakow. And the

22:39.200 --> 22:44.240
Munich school began in Munich, and some of the leading members of the Munich school are listed

22:44.240 --> 22:49.520
here. There are several others of equal importance, but I'm going to be focusing on these people.

22:49.520 --> 22:54.960
And then we move into Poland. So Hermann Ingarn was a member of the Munich school who then

22:54.960 --> 23:03.360
reconstituted it in Poland. And Karol Wojtyła is a... So in German, you can put the verb at the end

23:03.360 --> 23:12.560
of the sentence. You can't do that here. Karol Wojtyła was a friend of Roman Ingarn and also a

23:12.560 --> 23:17.120
philosopher, also very closely connected to Max Schäger, who's another member of the Munich

23:17.120 --> 23:23.920
school. But we'll come back to him in a minute. All right, so they extended Hossal's formal

23:23.920 --> 23:30.320
ontology to create material ontologies, just like all of these people are doing BFO.

23:31.040 --> 23:36.720
So they worked on, usually on quite philosophical topics, but Reiner, for instance, worked on law.

23:36.720 --> 23:44.720
Edith Stein worked on the state. Ingarn worked on art and many other things. And Wojtyła worked

23:44.720 --> 23:51.680
on things like freedom and conscience and religion, I'm told. All right, so...

23:51.920 --> 24:01.440
And Hossal hated it. So he said it was a picture book phenomenon ontology. This is not real

24:01.440 --> 24:07.840
philosophy. Who cares about whether it's real philosophy? Nowadays, it's being shown to be

24:07.840 --> 24:15.280
quite practically important. This is what he... So he was a real admirer of Reiner, for instance,

24:15.840 --> 24:21.600
but he didn't like the Munich idea that you can take a discipline and then subject it to

24:21.600 --> 24:27.440
essential analysis. So this is the Goettingen school, or the four important bits of it.

24:28.240 --> 24:34.800
Ingarn was in Goettingen, Edith Stein was in Goettingen, serving as the slave of Hossal and

24:35.760 --> 24:42.640
Reiner. It makes him look a lot older, but he never became a lot older. And then Krakow,

24:42.640 --> 24:52.480
we have this gentleman, and two of these people became saints. Now, that's amazing. You have a

24:52.480 --> 25:01.440
rather small school of philosophy, and two of his members became saints. And anyway, we'll come back

25:01.440 --> 25:08.320
to that. So these were very close friends. Ingarn and Edith Stein were very close friends.

25:08.320 --> 25:12.320
There were other female members of the Munich school. I'm not going to talk about them because

25:12.320 --> 25:18.400
there isn't time, but on many occasions during the rest of these slides, and there are only about

25:18.400 --> 25:27.440
300 of them, I'm going to use him. And many of the slides were put together some years ago,

25:27.440 --> 25:34.480
when we could say him. And many of the people I'm citing also said him. But in many cases, I mean

25:35.120 --> 25:44.880
her or him. So forgive me for the him, the repetitious use of the word him, in what follows.

25:45.600 --> 25:52.560
All right, so this is Edith Stein, otherwise known as Saint Therese, Benedicta Acroce. She

25:54.560 --> 26:01.040
merited the recognition of her sainthood because of what she did in Auschwitz, because she was a Jew.

26:01.600 --> 26:07.600
She had a rather bad time because she was female. This was a time when females were not taken seriously

26:07.600 --> 26:14.080
in universities. But she was brilliant. And she wrote major parts of some of herself major works.

26:14.080 --> 26:20.480
So she was his, a slave is a bit unfair. But he never made her his assistant in where he would

26:20.480 --> 26:31.680
have made a male is assistant. And so there is a book called walls are crumbling, which is about

26:32.640 --> 26:37.280
seven modern modern Jewish philosophical thinkers who have turned to the Catholic faith.

26:38.080 --> 26:43.520
Now, in order to become a saint, you have to become Catholic. That's taken for granted.

26:44.480 --> 26:52.720
We're going to be talking about four of these. And I own a copy of this book, but I couldn't

26:52.720 --> 26:59.920
find it in time to work out what he says about Husser. But I do remember what he says about

26:59.920 --> 27:08.320
Reinach. And I'm not sure if this picture was available on the web. It's a picture of Husser,

27:08.320 --> 27:14.800
I think on his death bed. So Good Friday, what a wonderful day where some of Husser's last words.

27:16.160 --> 27:21.920
Yes, Christ has forgiven us everything. Now, I'm not sure that that's true. I think that

27:21.920 --> 27:28.640
us right here exaggerate. And you can make up yourself, make up your own mind. So this man

27:28.640 --> 27:33.440
was described by Husser as the phenomenologists, phenomenologists, because he was a very good

27:33.440 --> 27:39.680
teacher who knew Husser's ideas probably better than Husser himself. And so people like Edith

27:39.680 --> 27:45.760
Stein and Inga became phenomenologists because of Reinach's fantastic teaching capability.

27:48.240 --> 27:57.040
He was a nice man and part of a nice family. But then he was called up to be a member of the

27:57.040 --> 28:03.920
German army in the First World War. So he died at the age of 34. He published one major book

28:03.920 --> 28:11.360
before he died and several very important essays. We've managed to collect other writings and publish

28:11.360 --> 28:22.400
them. I was, well, we'll see what I did in that regard in a minute. In this book, World's a Crumbling,

28:23.120 --> 28:30.320
Ursus Reicher describes, so his sister became a nun when Reinach died in the trench.

28:31.280 --> 28:36.640
He'd been communicating with his sister with letters and his letters survived about faith

28:36.640 --> 28:42.560
and Christianity and so on. Reinach never became a Catholic through a proper process of conversion,

28:42.560 --> 28:47.520
but he was certainly a Christian. He was certainly not a Jew. He was born a Jew.

28:48.320 --> 28:54.880
And so his sister became a nun. And you have to be a Catholic to become a nun. And she was,

28:56.480 --> 29:02.880
I don't know the technical terms here, but she was admitted into the convent by the Abbas

29:03.840 --> 29:12.080
with the following words. The Abbas knew Adolf. Today, we shall receive unto our number someone

29:12.080 --> 29:21.840
who even according to the flesh is a sister of our Lord. Now, this is like comparing Reinach to God.

29:23.840 --> 29:33.040
And maybe it happened, I don't know, but Ursus Reicher said that. Now, Reinach was a proponent

29:33.840 --> 29:38.640
of phenomenological realism and Reinach has been taken more seriously in the French and

29:38.640 --> 29:43.840
Italian speaking world than in English speaking world, but we're catching up. And this is a book

29:43.840 --> 29:49.600
of Reinach's papers about phenomenological realism. Now, you have to realize that to be an ontologist

29:49.600 --> 29:55.520
in the sense of immunity school or in the sense of BFO, you have to be a realist. That is to say,

29:55.520 --> 30:02.640
you have to believe you're describing the world and representing the essences or universals of

30:02.640 --> 30:10.080
kinds in the world. And so the many phenomenologists were all realists. In around 1910, people say,

30:11.200 --> 30:18.560
Hossal fell on his head and this damaged relevant brain circuits. And so from that point,

30:19.120 --> 30:26.080
they say he was an idealist. He didn't believe in the real world anymore. Neither did his major

30:26.080 --> 30:34.960
followers. He became a famous representative of the German tradition of transcendental philosophy.

30:34.960 --> 30:43.040
So he was like Hegel, Kant, and so forth. He picks at himself now as a great man in German

30:43.040 --> 30:49.360
philosophy, which he was able to do, even though he was Jewish at that time, because people didn't

30:49.360 --> 30:57.520
care. They did later. And so he really was treated as a great German philosopher by

30:57.520 --> 31:04.320
the German philosophers of the time, and by the realist philosophers at the time. But they

31:05.040 --> 31:11.680
argued with each other. And so there was a kind of interchange, a dialectic between the realists,

31:11.680 --> 31:18.400
particularly Inga, who wrote several major works on this topic, and Hossal, who tried to fight back,

31:19.360 --> 31:26.800
and in a way, the realists lost in the sense that they never convinced Hossal to become,

31:27.600 --> 31:33.600
to go back to being a realist. But they won in the sense that they created a lot of very good

31:33.600 --> 31:39.280
ontology, which we will talk about in a minute. Reina's principle,

31:40.000 --> 31:49.680
in the sense of most well-recognized contribution, was to invent or formulate for the first time,

31:49.680 --> 31:55.520
in an extended way, the theory of speech acts. So normally people think of that

31:55.520 --> 32:03.040
theory as having been invented by Austen and Searle. The first hints of theory along these lines can

32:03.040 --> 32:07.840
be found much earlier. In Thomas Reid, for instance, there are several passages which

32:07.840 --> 32:13.520
describe what later became speech acts. Reina has a whole monograph devoted to the topic.

32:14.160 --> 32:22.640
And it's a monograph which is about what he calls the a priori foundations of the civil law.

32:23.520 --> 32:30.640
The a priori foundations of the civil law are to be found in something like an analysis of the act of

32:30.640 --> 32:36.640
promising. And the act of promising is the principle example in many of the papers.

32:36.640 --> 32:45.520
In the Austen and Searle tradition about speech acts. And so I, along with a German

32:46.400 --> 32:54.080
colleague of mine, a brilliant man who died, also died much too young, edited the complete

32:56.160 --> 33:03.200
text critical edition of Reina's works. It's 848 pages. And it's the most honest thing I ever

33:03.200 --> 33:09.040
did in my life. So it really is a very, very scholarly piece of work. We have a whole volume

33:09.040 --> 33:15.680
just to show all the changes, including misprints in different editions and so forth. Because that's

33:15.680 --> 33:23.040
what the scholarly edition has to do. And if you don't do that, someone else will have to do it later.

33:24.160 --> 33:31.840
So I spent some years devoting my life to Reina. I was one of the few people who were

33:31.840 --> 33:36.160
attempting to show to the world that Reina had interest in things to say. And that the whole

33:37.840 --> 33:43.040
tradition of analytic philosophy should be viewed in a new life. So

33:46.320 --> 33:52.800
I asked chat GPT about this content, whether we were successful. Is there a contemporary

33:54.080 --> 34:00.800
reception of Reina's philosophy? And so I asked this question twice. This is the first

34:01.200 --> 34:06.240
at least twice. Some notable philosophers who have engaged with Reina's ontology of social

34:06.240 --> 34:13.200
entities include John Searle. And then it says Searle has been a prominent advocate for Reina's

34:13.200 --> 34:19.920
ontology of social entity. Now I've talked to Searle on multiple occasions. If I even come

34:19.920 --> 34:26.400
close to mentioning the name Reina, he gets angry. He hates the idea that Reina would even exist,

34:26.400 --> 34:32.800
because his wife also used to get angry. That would diminish the greatness of Searle. I like

34:32.800 --> 34:41.600
Searle, I think it's fantastic. But this is a blatant lie. Similarly, Raimo Tuonella, who also

34:41.600 --> 34:46.960
works on social ontology, he says, has also been influenced by Reina's ontology of social

34:46.960 --> 34:54.720
entities. That's just not true. Then it says Barry Smith, well, this is in bigger type here,

34:54.720 --> 35:01.680
Barry Smith has been a critic of Reina's ontology of social entities. That's

35:02.480 --> 35:08.640
disgustingly not true. And then it says something rather bland about Kevin. So Kevin has also

35:08.640 --> 35:16.960
engaged with Reina's ontology. That's true. But it's weak. Typically, chat GP team is weak when

35:16.960 --> 35:23.040
it's when it says something which is true, which isn't always the case. And then I asked it again.

35:25.520 --> 35:32.800
So it says, again, it gives the absurd thesis about Searle. Right, Hussal was a very

35:33.840 --> 35:38.960
strong admirer of Reina. I don't think he was heavily influenced by Reina. He was an admirer

35:38.960 --> 35:45.120
of Reina, because Reina was heavily influenced by him. Shaila knew about Reina. They were both

35:45.120 --> 35:53.200
members of the Munich School. And I think this is just about true. Searle, we dealt with.

35:53.280 --> 36:00.000
Charles Taylor has no idea who Reina is. And Rudolf Karna has absolutely no idea of Reina

36:00.000 --> 36:09.120
and wouldn't care. And so, and then I try again. Now he mentions Ingellen, which is good, but he

36:09.120 --> 36:14.480
mentions Dagfin Follersdahl, who was quite an important analytic philosopher who wrote

36:14.480 --> 36:20.480
a piece about Hussal early on. But he never knew anything about Reina. This is just

36:21.200 --> 36:30.400
typical chat GPT lying. And then we asked it for a fourth time, and it gave this list.

36:31.760 --> 36:38.400
I mean, including Emmanuel Evina. And I don't even know if Georgio Agamben is, but he sounds

36:38.400 --> 36:44.320
French. I mean, French in the sense of bad French philosophy, not French in the sense of not being

36:44.640 --> 36:52.640
Italian. And somebody called Jacques. And so this is a real mystery. None of these. Most of the

36:52.640 --> 36:57.920
people on this list didn't know who Reina was. Most of them would have hated the idea of Reina's

36:57.920 --> 37:03.600
philosophy. So why does chat GPT think that all, I don't know, 17 of these people

37:04.640 --> 37:09.040
have engaged with Reina's ontology of social entities? Well, I think the problem is Kevin.

37:09.680 --> 37:17.600
Kevin wrote a piece on, well, so Derrida, the ends of phenomenology, attacking

37:18.400 --> 37:25.200
many of the names on this list. And chat GPT has this piece in its training material. And so it just

37:26.160 --> 37:31.680
Reina, Derrida, same page. So that means Derrida must have influenced Reina for something.

37:31.680 --> 37:37.120
And all right, now,

37:41.280 --> 37:46.480
Reina was very clever. He knew how to read philosophy. And he read Hume's treatise. And he

37:46.480 --> 37:52.000
realized that there was a mistake being made, and still being made today on part of people who

37:52.720 --> 37:58.720
are fans of Hume's philosophy. The one person who doesn't make this mistake is George Davies,

37:58.720 --> 38:04.560
who I believe is now no longer alive. But he was a Scottish philosopher. Hume was Scottish.

38:05.600 --> 38:09.040
But he was also interested in Hussal and Reina. And he wrote this piece

38:09.920 --> 38:16.720
in which he explained that even Hume distinguished between the analytic and the

38:16.720 --> 38:25.520
materially necessary. So in Reina's terms, the relations between red and orange and red and

38:25.520 --> 38:30.400
yellow. So red and orange are more closely resembling each other than red and yellow.

38:30.400 --> 38:34.880
That is a material necessity. It's not the formal necessity. So it's not analytic.

38:35.600 --> 38:41.440
It's a material necessity. Most people will tell you that there are no material necessities in Hume's

38:42.000 --> 38:50.400
philosophy. But Reina found passages in which Hume appeals to material necessities,

38:50.400 --> 38:54.960
particularly passages where he's talking about sense date. So if you're interested,

38:54.960 --> 39:04.160
you can look at this piece by Davies. And that's Kant. That's Kant from a different angle.

39:07.120 --> 39:16.880
And this is a very nice paper on this whole unique phenomenology. And this is a passage from

39:16.880 --> 39:26.320
this piece. So this man, Fréchette, who is French, but in a good way, he has a very nice

39:26.320 --> 39:31.760
account of the essential structures, the work of the Munich phenomenologists. And he points out

39:31.760 --> 39:39.040
that Kit Fein has rediscovered some of the theses relating to essential structures and modality

39:39.040 --> 39:45.760
which were worked out by the Munich phenomenologists 100 years earlier.

39:46.880 --> 39:50.640
All right. So just so that we all have the same terminology, to say that something is a

39:51.360 --> 39:57.280
analytic means that it's a truth of logic or of mathematics. And it's a tautology. It doesn't

39:57.280 --> 40:02.320
add anything to what we said. Synthetic is a truth with content, which means it's not

40:02.320 --> 40:08.800
reducible to any logical truth. A priori is a matter of knowledge. To say that something is

40:08.800 --> 40:14.960
a priori is to say that it's known independently of experience. And to say that it's a posteriori,

40:15.280 --> 40:21.200
a priori is to say that it's known by experience and had to be known by experience. You couldn't

40:21.200 --> 40:31.040
know it by logic. And Q is commonly held to believe that everything a priori is also analytic.

40:32.240 --> 40:37.840
And the Munich philosophers like me and like many other people hold that there are

40:37.840 --> 40:45.680
synthetic a priori truth. And the example of red is closer to orange than it is to yellow

40:46.560 --> 40:51.600
is an example of one such truth. And we'll see many more true when done. And law is full of such

40:51.600 --> 41:02.560
truths. So for Kant, however, then synthetic a priori truths can recognize synthetic a priori

41:02.560 --> 41:08.640
truths. He thought you made a mistake by not recognizing them. And commonly, people do hold

41:08.640 --> 41:12.720
that you made that mistake. Even you probably thought he made that mistake, although he didn't

41:12.720 --> 41:16.960
think it was a mistake. But he didn't make it. That's what he didn't know.

41:20.000 --> 41:27.440
So Kant thought that the only a priori synthetic truths are truths of Euclidean geometry and

41:27.520 --> 41:31.920
Newtonian physics. That's about it. Causality, space and time.

41:34.160 --> 41:40.160
For the Munich picture book philosophers, however, there are synthetic a priori truths

41:40.160 --> 41:47.920
everywhere in every aspect of the out. And so this is just a few examples.

41:49.120 --> 41:55.200
Just to start with, then this is more. And we'll see many more. These are just the first

41:56.160 --> 41:59.920
set. All of these were dealt with by the Munich phenomenologists one way or another.

41:59.920 --> 42:07.440
There's even an a priori theory of chemistry that was worked out by one of the female members

42:07.440 --> 42:14.400
of the Munich school. All right, now what that's I've said, Reinhardt is important primarily for

42:14.400 --> 42:22.160
his theory of speech acts. But I think he's even more important for a concomitant discovery,

42:23.120 --> 42:30.320
which changes our whole view of the history of philosophy, I believe. And it's a view about

42:30.320 --> 42:37.920
how entities exist in time. So for Plato, everything which exists is unchanging.

42:39.200 --> 42:45.040
We can only have knowledge about unchanging truths about the heavens, for instance, the

42:45.120 --> 42:52.240
geometry of the stars, because of course, they never change. Anything on earth, we can only have

42:54.080 --> 43:00.000
beliefs about these beliefs will be guessing. Because things are changing on the earth,

43:00.000 --> 43:06.160
so we can't really know. But we can only know about the ideal entities, such as numbers,

43:06.160 --> 43:14.640
values and so forth. Now, another sort of history, and this was the typical American 20th century

43:14.720 --> 43:20.400
account, says that every sort of history is about things which are always changing,

43:20.400 --> 43:24.800
things which are part of the world of what happens and is the case, things which are subject to

43:24.800 --> 43:28.880
causality. They're changing all the time, you're changing all the time, even this changing,

43:28.880 --> 43:35.360
even this table is changing, even a slump of granite is changing all the time, because it's

43:35.360 --> 43:44.240
losing atoms very slowly, but still. So this is the standard 20th century view, it's the standard

43:44.240 --> 43:55.920
view often ascribed to Hume. And what Reinhacht did is, this is Aristotle's view. Aristotle thought

43:55.920 --> 44:02.960
that there are empirical things, so he was an improvement on Plato. Plato thought everything

44:02.960 --> 44:09.120
was unchanging. Aristotle recognized that they were changing things like organisms,

44:09.120 --> 44:20.000
which were at the heart of his philosophy. Reinhacht recognized that there are ideal entities,

44:21.280 --> 44:27.040
or entities which have the feature of ideal entities that they're not affected by causality

44:27.040 --> 44:35.040
and by causal change, but which are rooted in history because they are made by humans.

44:36.000 --> 44:42.480
So there are three sorts of history. There is the Platonic history of things like numbers,

44:42.480 --> 44:46.480
there is the empirical history of things like people, and then there is the

44:47.680 --> 44:53.840
a priori history of things like claims and debts and property rights and many, many other things

44:53.840 --> 45:00.720
that we'll talk about in due course. Architectural plans would be an example, chemical sequences

45:00.800 --> 45:08.080
would be an example, gene sequences maybe would be an example. These are all entities which

45:08.080 --> 45:15.360
exist in history from a certain point, but which do not change. And until they cease to exist,

45:15.360 --> 45:21.520
so you pay off your debt, the debt ceases to exceed, for instance, or you synthesize a molecule,

45:21.520 --> 45:26.560
but it's so difficult to keep the molecule in existence that after a while you stop synthesizing

45:26.560 --> 45:33.520
it, but that molecular pattern did exist for a certain period of time in the world of reality,

45:33.520 --> 45:43.440
not just in the world of patterns. All right, so Anita Stein had a similar view about the state.

45:44.240 --> 45:54.240
Now, states change, but there is something which she discusses in her big book about

45:54.240 --> 46:00.960
the state, which is unchanging about a state, and it's in the same ballpark as things like

46:00.960 --> 46:10.080
debts and claims. It's things like authority. All right, now, so Reinhardt was the principal

46:10.800 --> 46:17.920
advocate of this view. He was, the view is extended even further in very interesting ways,

46:17.920 --> 46:26.400
as we will see by Ingaarden, his pupil and friend, and by Edith Stein and by some of the other

46:26.400 --> 46:35.600
unifinomenologists, but it was him who showed how we can make progress in developing an ontology of

46:35.600 --> 46:41.040
these entities of the third kind, which arise particularly in the realm of social ontology.

46:41.920 --> 46:49.120
And so there are various different kinds of social acts. The word social act was used also by Thomas

46:49.120 --> 46:54.800
Reid when he was talking about what we nowadays call speech acts, but not all social acts are

46:54.800 --> 47:02.400
speech acts. Many social acts are document acts. And in November, we're going to have a visiting

47:02.400 --> 47:10.720
speaker or a visiting Zoomer who is going to be talking about not speech acts and not document

47:10.800 --> 47:20.640
acts, but device acts. An example of a device act would be a clock. And anyway, there are many

47:20.640 --> 47:26.320
other more interesting examples of device acts, but he is really keen on clock. All right, you can

47:26.320 --> 47:30.960
see some of the details of what we'll be doing in November. In November the 6th, I think it is,

47:30.960 --> 47:37.280
on the wiki page, but that's a work in progress. That particular entry in the program is a work

47:37.280 --> 47:43.120
in progress, as indeed are most of the entry, depending on how well I do in finishing this

47:44.400 --> 47:48.880
today. All right, so social acts are informing, questioning, requesting, commanding,

47:48.880 --> 47:55.440
promising. Rainer worked out some of all of those things, and they each have an experience which

47:55.440 --> 48:03.680
underlies them. So if you make a command, then you have to have a volition, a will, that the

48:03.680 --> 48:10.640
command be executed. That's an essential law. It's a necessitation. And now, of course, there are

48:10.640 --> 48:16.240
some lazy generals who just, it looks as if they're issuing commands, but they don't care,

48:16.240 --> 48:22.880
they're just reading what their adjutant has given them, but they're not commanding, according

48:22.880 --> 48:30.400
to Rainer. Just as if you tell a lie when you say, I'll give you $100 tomorrow, you're not making a

48:30.400 --> 48:38.400
problem. Now, clearly, we see how Rainer deals with those kinds of cases in a little bit. So

48:38.400 --> 48:45.520
enactments are what lawmakers do when they enact a law. For instance, when the mother decides what

48:45.520 --> 48:52.480
time the children have to be home at night. And then there is an outcome, which might be a state,

48:52.480 --> 48:57.120
a state of affairs, or something like that. So the state, which is the outcome of informing is

48:57.200 --> 49:02.080
that the informee now knows the thing which the informer was informing her about.

49:03.760 --> 49:08.480
And asking a question similarly, and there is another beauty phenomenologist, which I'm not

49:08.480 --> 49:16.080
going to talk about, a man called Daubert, who did a great deal of work, very interesting work,

49:16.080 --> 49:23.280
on these kinds of questions, including on the question of questions. And I, along with the

49:23.360 --> 49:30.000
co-auth editor of Rainer's works, whose name is Carl Schumann, I wrote a paper about this man.

49:31.600 --> 49:37.120
And he's called Johannes Daubert. And he's interesting because he never published a word in

49:37.120 --> 49:44.480
his life. He was probably the most important figure in the Munich school. He was the one figure in

49:44.480 --> 49:52.320
the Munich school who was allowed to criticize Husser to his face. But he was a farmer. He didn't

49:53.600 --> 49:58.560
need a degree. He came into the university, discussed, and wrote notes. And he wrote

49:58.560 --> 50:07.040
thousand pages of notes. And like Husser, he used the secret shorthand. And my colleague now,

50:07.040 --> 50:12.480
unfortunately, not here, was the first person to decide for the secret shorthand. And so we were

50:12.480 --> 50:18.720
able to publish some of his unpublished shorthand notes. And a lot of them were about questions.

50:18.720 --> 50:26.320
So we published a paper about questions based on Daubert. And at that point, there was practically

50:26.320 --> 50:35.920
nothing published about Daubert. Nobody knew the name. The A-U-B-E-R-T. So we start the paper by saying,

50:36.480 --> 50:43.520
as is well known, Johannes Daubert has, I can't exactly how it goes on. All right, this is in

50:43.520 --> 50:51.440
garden. And he's at age about 36 here. And so he's part of the Munich school along with Schäler,

50:51.440 --> 50:57.040
who we will meet a little bit later and right now. And along with the early Husser, who was himself

50:58.560 --> 51:03.360
engaged in just the same sort of work, but at the formal level rather than at the domain

51:04.000 --> 51:11.520
specific level. This is the old Bodleian library in Oxford. And in 1971,

51:12.480 --> 51:17.840
this is the old, I wasn't in there. I was in the new Bodleian library, which is much more boring.

51:18.880 --> 51:26.400
But by accident, I found a copy of this book. And it changed my life. I opened it and I saw

51:27.520 --> 51:34.240
tables of different kinds of modes of being, and then also tables of how these different

51:34.240 --> 51:38.960
kinds of modes of being represent themselves in the past or present or the future, or in

51:39.680 --> 51:46.080
speculation, hypothesis, fiction and so forth. And until that point, I had wanted to, as I said,

51:46.080 --> 51:52.320
I wanted to write a PhD on aesthetics and mathematics. I already knew the name in garden,

51:52.320 --> 51:57.760
and I knew that he was known for his writings on aesthetics, which is why I picked up the book.

51:58.400 --> 52:03.920
But when I saw what he was doing with ontology, which was for him more important than aesthetics,

52:04.720 --> 52:11.040
just he wrote about ontology primarily in Polish, which was a kind of hurdle.

52:13.280 --> 52:18.720
So I immediately saw that I was going to write a PhD on ontology.

52:20.160 --> 52:25.440
And I spent the rest of my life working on ontology. This was even more important than

52:25.440 --> 52:30.800
Wittgenstein's tractators. This is the most important book in my life. And we'll see where

52:30.800 --> 52:35.360
it comes from in a minute. Since Ingaard never wrote a book called Time and Modes of Being

52:36.000 --> 52:41.760
in any language. All right, what he did was write a book called Controversy over the existence

52:41.760 --> 52:49.920
of the world, which was published as part of Ingaard's contribution to the Polish war effort.

52:50.640 --> 52:55.280
He was a bit late, but still. So he'd written everything before then in German, because that's

52:55.280 --> 53:01.920
the language of science. It was then anyway. And so that was the language of phenomenology.

53:01.920 --> 53:08.400
He was studying in Göttingen and collaborating with phenomenologies most of whom were German.

53:08.400 --> 53:14.640
So it was published in two volumes, the second of which in some versions has two parts, so three

53:14.640 --> 53:24.000
volumes. And then at a later stage, he wrote a third volume, so one, two, one, two, two, and then

53:24.000 --> 53:30.480
three. And the third volume was published in German in 1974. The whole first two volumes were

53:30.480 --> 53:37.680
published in English only recently. However, I can read German, so I knew the German edition

53:37.680 --> 53:44.480
of this big book already quite well. And above all, I knew about Ingaard's book on the literary

53:44.480 --> 53:51.360
work of art very well. So that was probably the third most important book in my philosophical career.

53:51.360 --> 54:01.120
It's an amazing book because it's not technical, but it contains a whole amount of new information

54:01.120 --> 54:08.640
about what literature involves. And it's information which is new, but information which you can't

54:08.720 --> 54:15.040
help but realize is being true. In other words, it's not surprising, but it's not boring either.

54:15.840 --> 54:22.080
And you see, it's an investigation on the borderlines of ontology, logic, and theory of language.

54:22.080 --> 54:29.520
So his job here was an ontological job. He realized this ontological job by writing about

54:29.520 --> 54:35.120
literature. And I will explain how that works in a minute. And then in another book, which again

54:35.120 --> 54:41.920
was published only recently in English, but which this one was published first in 1931 in German.

54:41.920 --> 54:46.560
And the other one, too, was published in 1931. There are many other writings of Ingaard, and these

54:46.560 --> 54:52.000
are just the important ones for our purposes. Most of them were published first of all in German.

54:53.120 --> 54:57.520
So this is the big book, volume one, Controversy over the Existence of the World.

54:57.840 --> 55:05.360
And in this book, he distinguishes four kinds of dependence. Now, he's coming

55:06.800 --> 55:10.880
from the logical investigations where relations of dependence are very important,

55:11.520 --> 55:18.240
but he's looking at relations, varieties of relations of dependence. So one variety

55:19.040 --> 55:26.400
is the dependence of a fictional character on its author. And then everything about the

55:26.480 --> 55:31.280
fictional character is determined by the author. Without the author, there would be no physical

55:31.280 --> 55:36.080
character. And there is no truth about the fictional character, which was not determined

55:36.080 --> 55:43.520
by the author. That's called heteronymous dependence, or just heteronomy. Derivation

55:44.400 --> 55:52.720
is a matter of coming into existence. So a baby is dependent on a mother and a father, too,

55:53.680 --> 55:59.360
for coming into existence, but not for continually existence. And then

56:01.520 --> 56:06.880
an entity is dependent on another entity in the non-self-sufficient input sense,

56:07.600 --> 56:13.840
if the one entity needs to coexist in a single hole with the second entity. An example of this would

56:13.840 --> 56:21.280
be color and extension. You can't have color without having some extended thing or extended space.

56:22.000 --> 56:28.640
And then just plain vanilla dependence is depending on another entity in order to remain

56:28.640 --> 56:35.840
in existence. So John's love for Mary goes out of existence if John dies. So John's love for

56:35.840 --> 56:44.560
Mary is dependent in this plain vanilla sense, because it depends on remaining in existence

56:44.560 --> 56:53.680
upon John. So this is the same story, but with examples. So derived entities are entities which

56:53.680 --> 56:58.720
are dependent on something for beginning to exist. There's only one really good example of a non-derived

56:58.720 --> 57:09.280
entity, and that's God. Everything else had to come from somewhere else, except whatever happened

57:09.280 --> 57:15.440
just before the big bang. I don't know. But I'm sure there was something else just before the big

57:15.440 --> 57:21.360
bang. And so even what was there just before the big bang was derived from something prior.

57:22.080 --> 57:28.960
And then non-self-sufficient would be a color, and self-sufficient would be an apple or a person

57:28.960 --> 57:34.960
or a planet. And then dependent in the plain vanilla sense would be a mammal is dependent upon

57:34.960 --> 57:40.800
oxygen for its remaining in existence. But otherwise it's independent. It's not dependent upon any.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.920
All right. So these are the four existential moments of dependence and independence.

57:46.800 --> 57:52.880
And entities can have various combinations of these three kinds of dependence. So God is not

57:52.880 --> 58:00.480
dependent on anything foreign. He's an absolute. His mode of existence is absolute. Nearly everything

58:00.480 --> 58:06.800
else is very dependent. Fictional characters are very dependent. And in order to understand dependence

58:07.840 --> 58:12.640
in gardens, started to work on the structure of military work. What are fictional characters?

58:15.120 --> 58:22.240
So there is this paper by a poll called Hood's Simpsky, who hangs around in Austria these days,

58:23.200 --> 58:28.640
which summarizes all of what I just said. The gray is the non-realizable.

58:31.440 --> 58:35.680
So I don't think I'm going to go into details, but you trust me that this is a pretty good

58:35.680 --> 58:41.920
account of what is possible given in God's approach. And this is only one part of the approach.

58:41.920 --> 58:46.640
That's why he needs such a big book in four parts, because he wants to solve the problem of the

58:46.640 --> 58:53.360
existence of the work. He wants to show herself who died before it was finished that realism was correct.

58:54.240 --> 59:03.280
And this diagram here yields eight possible modes of being. And so the real world has to be one of

59:03.280 --> 59:13.440
these eight, because these are the only options. And God is the first one, A1. And we'll come,

59:13.440 --> 59:15.280
well, we can look at the others in a minute. So

59:15.600 --> 59:27.280
I don't need to go into this detail. So this is a picture now of all the different categories.

59:28.080 --> 59:35.920
There are ideal entities, which are not actual. They can't move, they can't think,

59:35.920 --> 59:43.040
they can't do anything. There's one absolute being, which is God, which is actual. And God is

59:43.040 --> 59:51.200
original and autonomous. And then everything else is derivative of our heteronomy. So derivative

59:51.200 --> 59:58.560
are present continuance, like people and planets. And a slightly weaker form, which in God calls

59:58.560 --> 01:00:10.160
post-actual, are past continuance, which are things like Julius Caesar and President True.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:17.920
And you see, as we go from God to the present God, to the present events, and then to the past

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:24.720
events, and then to the future events, which are only possible, they're not actual in any

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:30.400
sense. We're getting weaker and weaker until we get to the non-actual, which are what in God

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:35.040
and the cause purely intentional objects, which are heteronomous and therefore derivative,

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:43.920
because they depend upon something else, which is true. And so we have something like a great

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:55.280
chain of being from absolute being to shell opponent. And so these are the eight possible

01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:02.160
modes of being. So we have God and the time entities. And then we have ideal entities like

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:07.680
deck, plane, mortgage, and so on. Then we have present continuance, present processes, present

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:17.280
events, purely intentional entities and purely intentional entities of a weaker kind. And so

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:26.880
Inga wrote the literary work of art in order to show why idealism is wrong. Idealism would say

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:37.680
that the real world does not go here, present continuum, which is where we would want it to

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:45.120
go. So idealism says the real world does not go under present continuance. So how is he going to

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:52.560
show that the real world does not go under present continuance? Well, the only alternative option

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:57.360
is that the real world is, and this is the idealist view, the real world is a purely intentional

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:05.840
object. Purely intentional object is dependent upon, in all respects, for all its qualities, on some

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:20.560
author, some creator, some, some origin. And every creator of every literary work has only a finite

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:27.120
amount of time and therefore only a finite amount of text to determine all the qualities of its

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:35.600
fictional character. Therefore, qualities of fictional characters are always spotting.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:45.360
They have loci of indeterminacy in Inga's terms. No real entity has loci of indeterminacy,

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.720
because for every real entity, if we have a question about any quality, we can always ask that,

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:56.560
answer that question by measuring or by investigating more closely. We can't find out

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:04.480
how tall Hamlet was by measuring. And the same applies to Sherlock Holmes, unless

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:11.760
Conan Doyle tells us that he was exactly five feet 11. But then we Watson, we still wouldn't

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.560
know how tall he was. And we wouldn't know many other things, but Sherlock Holmes and Watson and

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.280
their dog and the kind of whiskey they drank and so on. So this is the argument. This is why the

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.560
book on literature was a contribution to the resolution of the controversy over the existence

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:32.800
of the world, which Inga and Hustel have been fighting for the whole of their lives. So this is

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:38.960
a picture of a literary work. The basis of the literary work, this is, these are strata that

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:43.600
she wrote. And as soon as you've written literature work, you've created all the literature. So you

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:50.720
have word sound, because when you read a novel or a poem, you hear the words, even if you don't

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.920
hear them with your ears, you hear them with your mind. And you probably hear Shakespeare wrong.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:03.520
Because Shakespeare Shakespeare's plays were written at a time when English people

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:11.200
spoke the combination dialect of Yorkshire and Danish, which doesn't sound at all like English,

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:17.360
but still that we hear we hear sound when we meet Shakespeare. When people perform Shakespeare,

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:24.000
they typically perform it in a non Yorkshire, Danish dialogue. Then we have meaning units,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.520
because we understand the meanings of the sentence. And higher order meaning structure,

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.960
what enable us to visualize the places and the events and so forth. Then we have what

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:41.840
he calls schematized aspects, including quasi-century aspect, which are things like the color of

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:49.200
Juliet's hair and so on, which are spotty. Then we have the objects events and safety affairs

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:56.000
and adult, which all of these graphics for Juliet and Hamlet and Romeo and so on and so on and so

01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:06.240
on and so forth. Here, as it is, Baker Street and Florence and Moscow. So Moscow is not present

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:14.960
in war and peace. It's not about Moscow. It's about Moscow here. And it would still be about

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:21.200
Moscow here. There was no Moscow in Russia. All right. And then we have at the very top,

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.680
and these are not necessary, value qualities, metaphysical qualities and other

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:32.080
features of a literary work, which exist from a certain point in time, if you're dealing with a

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:38.640
work which has a certain value. All right. Now, if you look at a musical work, you only have two

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:43.680
strapped. If you're lucky, you only have two strapped. Typically, you only have one,

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:49.040
namely the bangs and whistles, which make up the musical work. But sometimes you have value

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:54.800
qualities. It's a great musical work. But you don't have any of the rest. It is an opera,

01:05:54.800 --> 01:06:00.960
and you have even more of it. And Inga deals with four different kinds of works of art

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:07.360
in this book. So an architectural work is not identical to the building,

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:14.400
because the architectural work can be spoiled, changed, destroyed even, and the building may

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:21.760
be the same. For instance, if you build a sequence of really ugly towers around the work and put

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:26.560
Mickey Mouse features on the top of the tower, then you've spoiled the architectural work,

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:35.040
but the work itself hasn't changed. So that's Inga then. So the scientific work doesn't have

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:40.240
any of the metaphysical qualities, and it doesn't have any word sounds. The sounds do not play a

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:46.080
role in that scientific work. And journalists, he has a paper on what he calls borderline cases

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:51.520
of literary works, which deals with things like journalism, etc. The difference is that

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:59.600
a literary work represents represented objects. So they are heteronomous. They're purely

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:06.160
intentional. Whereas scientific work, if you're lucky, represents objects and events and states of

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:13.440
affairs in the world. That's why there is no corresponding stratum inside the work, because

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:24.880
the stratum is outside the work. And then we have intentionality going through the representations

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:31.600
in texts and symbols to the objects in the world. Alright, now this summarizes what I said earlier.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:38.560
So we will pause here and if there are any questions. Yes.

01:07:38.560 --> 01:08:00.880
Yes, so he thinks that the past is such that I have to be very careful here.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:07.920
The past doesn't exist. No, it's not actual, but it was once actual, and that's a pretty strong

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:15.440
kind of being. The future is not even future actual, because it may never happen. So the

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:22.240
future is always somehow probabilistic. And I think that's as far as he goes. He doesn't have a

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:28.400
sophisticated theory of time, to my knowledge. I'm sure he has lots of things to say about time,

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:35.040
but not in regard to the ontology. He talks about why he has this particular treatment of

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:41.840
past, present, and future. So time and modes of being, the book that I mentioned, is in fact

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:47.840
an English translation of parts of volume one of the controversy.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:57.440
I just want to go back, I guess, to when you're talking about change versus

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:06.240
unchanging and debt. Is that an example? How does that fit into dependency? And why is debt

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:15.280
unchanging? Yes, so I lend you five dollars. You have to give me five dollars within the week.

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:21.120
That debt just comes into existence. And then if you give back the five dollars, then it's

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.720
doesn't change. It doesn't become more intense, or less intense. It's just the debt just there.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:34.240
And there are many other things which are just there. For instance, if I was king of England,

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:41.200
we would have one. I could make you a knight. You don't become British, but your knighthood

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:46.320
would exist. It wouldn't change at all. And there are many, many others.

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:54.160
And where would that go into dependency? So the debt is dependent upon the

01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:03.440
debtor and the debtee. And there are different things to be said, depending on whether it's

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:08.080
a debt which is captured in some kind of document or not. And it could be that the debt is

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:13.440
captured in the document. And that that document serves then as the basis for other

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.280
debts or other claims and so forth. But in the simple case, it's just

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:22.720
a simple relation between human beings. And it's a thick relation.

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:30.400
The a priori? Everything I just said, I think it's a priori. In other words, you understood

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:35.040
what I said and you nodded your head. So that's all you need. Yeah.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:42.880
The huge schema with older categories, that's in the 1960s.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:49.040
That is present already in the Polish book, which was published in 1947.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.960
That is like dealing with so many things that have been

01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:02.000
English-speaking throughout the martial arts. Yeah, of course. These were really good philosophers.

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:06.880
And you can read it in English now. That's it, isn't it?

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:10.800
Yeah, the real problem is that each column is one hundred something dollars.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.240
Well, you can borrow, you can share, I don't know.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:21.920
Library with that. Yeah. If it's not in the UB Library, then tell me and I will tell them to order.

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:31.120
You said that in the old schema of God is absolute. Is that a term you use?

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:38.640
That's his term. I just realized that the final book written by Yiddish Stein is called

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:47.760
Absolute and Finite? Finite. Yes, so there is a book of letters between Ingarden and Yiddish Stein.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:54.240
And so they were communicating with each other constantly. I think, I don't know when the

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:59.840
communication stopped for a long time. And so they were, I'm sure, exchanging ideas

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:07.280
about philosophy as well. But I wouldn't want to say who was the more creative of the two.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:13.440
I think I could say that Ingarden was the more formalistic. Do you like lists and things?

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:22.240
I like lists. I like pictures. When I'm working on a new topic, the first thing I do is

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.280
put the name of the topic in Google and then ask for all the images.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:32.880
Can you just go to the bottom of the book as we do on the right list?

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:42.320
So the question is, are my sons serious? That's going to be the main one.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:51.040
So the bluntness of, or the lusciousness of, or the right shininess of them.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:55.120
So it occurs to me that we should send this around.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.880
Your name is already there. Otherwise, put your name on there.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:07.360
I'm not going to do anything with that sheet. I just want to know who's here.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:17.120
Yes. So I'm back to his idea of time for existence on moments of dependence.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:23.520
How much weight should we keep for the moments? I'm thinking, he kind of sounds like a grown

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:30.160
block theorist. So would it be something like the particular time slice that I think of it that way?

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:37.040
No, the moments are that they derive from the dependence-theoretic approach to sense data that

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:44.720
Husserl developed. Here, he took this from Stumpf, who was earlier and who specialized in

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:49.840
tone psychology, that psychology of music basically are. So if you have a musical tone,

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:55.680
you have a pitch, you have a timbre, and you have a loudness. They are moments of the pitch.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:02.000
And similarly, in Gunn said, modes of being have moments, and you have to have one or

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.640
other of these. You have to have one of each moment, but the moments might be high or low,

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:13.920
if I still present the song. And so he worked out the moments of being and then had a way of

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:20.080
combining the moments to create modes of being. And then he could use that to solve the problem

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:30.560
of idealism and really. So Ingaardin did not say that the strata of the literary work are dependent

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:38.240
on the author. They are dependent for their origin on the author. But in order to be maintained in

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:45.120
existence, they need readers. And a different population of readers will be responsible for

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:51.200
maintaining the literary work in existence. And so literary works do indeed change. They're not like

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:58.480
debts or dollars, or they change. And that's why I put this curve here. They could even die

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:04.560
if no one reads them anymore, or if all copies done this job. But they still have some of the

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:10.000
characteristics. So they don't change the causal reason. They change because the readership

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:17.360
has different tastes, reads new nuances, which may or may not have been there on the part of the

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:23.200
author, sees a political meaning that may or may not have been there on the part of the author.

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:29.280
So Shakespeare's plays have already changed in a big way on the sound level. And they're trying to

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:38.320
change them these days also on various political and avant-garde interpretation levels. So literary

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:44.160
works are still examples of ideal entities of the third kind, but they change because they are

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:52.160
dependent upon things like audiences, critics, editions, editors, and so forth. So are they,

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:58.560
so under this theory, are literary works fully determined, but under determined by the author,

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:04.880
like the full determination of the audience? Yeah, so that's a very good question.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:19.520
I don't... Ingaarden was a fan of very realistic late 19th century novels, if that helps you.

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:29.360
Yeah. And his proof, he says that in conclusion, idealism is false. Can it also just be saying

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:41.360
idealism is fiction? Well, no, because if we go back to scientific work, so scientific work is

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:47.040
meaning to be about the world. And the philosopher idealists who developed these theories did indeed

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:52.640
believe that the world is just a fiction. They thought that it was a fact that the world is a

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:59.840
fiction, where a fictional author doesn't hold that the world he's describing is a fact. It's

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.720
moving. Yeah. How do terminists, as some of you, translate a book?

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:15.360
Oh, so yes, so the life of a literary work may bifurcate or multi-furcate if you get many

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:21.760
translations and each translation, you may even get multiple translations in different cultures

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:26.560
then would have a different reading of the work. And so the work itself has a life which involves

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:34.640
multiple personalities. I once gave a talk at a German conference about Heidegger. Actually,

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:42.080
no, it was about translation. And my talk was, had the title Heidegger in German, Heidegger's work

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:51.040
is untranslatable. And there were lots of Heideggerians in the room, many, particularly Japanese

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:59.520
Heideggerians on the row. And the chair of the meeting was Japanese. And before I could even start

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:06.320
the first word, the Japanese all stood up in unison in the Japanese way and they all shouted,

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:12.000
of course, Heidegger can be translated. There are nine different translations of Heidegger

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.760
into Japanese. So in other words, I couldn't give my talk, it's the only time in my life I've been

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:30.160
prevented from speaking. All right, so works of art can have complicated lives, that's the

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:36.160
important thing, the life of the literary world. All right, now, I have a lot about Heidegger,

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:42.480
Ingaard's theory of systems, but I'm not going to go through that. I will. Actually, I may be able

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:51.040
to go through it quickly. So in volume three of the controversy over the existence of the world,

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:58.000
which is called the causal structure of the real world, and which is extracted in short form in

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:09.840
in an English text in a book called Man and Value. And the idea here is the idea of

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:17.840
relatively isolated systems. So I am a relatively isolated system, I'm a system, but I'm relatively

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:25.920
isolated because I have a skin, which isolates me relatively from the outside world. The outside

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:31.920
world can still penetrate and I can still penetrate from within into the outside world by speaking

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:41.760
or sweating or throwing or vomiting. But there is the skin and all animals have a hide or a skin

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:51.520
or some kind of closing closure, which which creates this relative isolation, which is a permeable

01:19:51.520 --> 01:20:04.000
membrane, which allows us also to expel waste. And so there is one relatively isolated system

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.960
and the other relatively isolated systems, we talk to each other, we ask things to each other.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:18.880
This is supposed to be a mind. So the mind is permeated by the external world in that we see

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:28.960
the external world, we move around within it and touch it. And anyway, if you're interested,

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:34.640
there is this paper called Ingardens Systems Theoretical Philosophical Anthropology.

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:43.600
So you can have tribes which arose from the isolated systems countries. And I have a whole

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:53.360
talk and a whole video on this, which you can dig around and find probably. So the world consists of

01:20:54.400 --> 01:21:01.360
and this is why I want to include this just briefly. So I have lots of blood cells in my body,

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:06.080
which are moving around independently. They are the only parts of my body, which are not connected

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:13.440
by me to some kind of tube or pipe to other parts of my body. So my lungs are connected to other

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:18.160
things which are connected again to other things. But blood cells are not tied to anything else.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:24.880
But all those linkages are relatively tiny. In other words, they are tubes which fit into a

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:31.920
large thing like the kidney or the heart and allow transmission of fluids and gases.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.840
Rather like wires in the good old days allow transmission of most code messages.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:44.240
So this is a picture of some of these tubes. And it's important that there's one rather

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:50.560
interesting tube here, connecting the mother to the placenta. And then there's something else

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:58.800
which goes here, which it's not so relevant. Actually, it is relevant. It's what I'm talking

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:07.760
about now. So there is a school of thought. It's not Irish. I think it's Dutch. It's in

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:15.360
Europe anyway, which says that the embryo or the fetus is a part of the mother.

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:22.560
And the argument is that it's connected and it's inside the mother. But if it's connected

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:30.880
by means of a tube, then that doesn't mean that it's a part of the mother. I could be connected

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:37.680
by means of wires to my headquarters. And the wires could be continuous. And my job is to transmit

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:43.520
most code messages to headquarters. That doesn't mean I'm a part of the person who's answering

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:48.800
my most code messages. And similarly, the fact that there is a connection which is going to be

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:59.200
disconnected very beautifully and smoothly when the time comes doesn't mean that the thing which

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:06.800
it's connected to is a part of the connecting system. So this is one system. And in this paper,

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:15.600
called 16 Days, which is about the ontology of the embryo, embryo ontology. So this

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:28.800
is the discipline of the gerontology. We argue that the embryo is, well, we don't need to argue

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:33.120
this. In those days, it was obvious to everybody. Now it's obvious to everybody except these four

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:41.920
or five Dutch and European ladies to work on. The metaphysics of pregnancy. And their main

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:49.920
thesis is that the fetus, once it's become attached to the mother, is a part of the mother.

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:56.080
And that's why the mother can abort the fetus any time she likes, because it's a part of it. So

01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:06.800
it's like having your fingernails cut. Anyway, we argue that the embryo, let me get this right,

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:18.000
that the organism, which is the eventual baby, begins to exist at the latest 16 days after fertilization.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:25.920
And in it, we say that the embryo is, I say this is what my line is. I don't know,

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:31.520
they're buried. It's not responsible for this time. We say that the relation between the fetus

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:37.840
and the mother is rather like the relationship between a tub of yogurt and refrigerate.

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.760
All right, that's what we say. And so in all their papers, these

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:49.120
metaphysicians of pregnancy, they quote that line. They don't quote the arguments,

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:54.560
they quote that line. They say, obviously, Smith is wrong. Therefore, the baby is a part of the

01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:03.680
mother. But I say quite explicitly that you can be an object and still be connected by a pipe

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:09.680
or a conduit or some kind of wire. And that's what happens with the baby, that it's connected

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:18.880
by a conduit. And the actual surface area of the baby is much bigger than the thickness of the

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:25.120
conduit. And the same applies to lungs and kidneys and livers and so forth. They are objects too.

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:34.160
And they are part of the mother, because they have the same genetics. They have the same source

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:40.880
of food and oxygen and so forth as the mother. The baby doesn't have the same genetics as the mother.

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:46.640
So that's one of many reasons why the baby is not a part of the mother. So the baby is a system,

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:52.800
which is inside another system, but not as part and not as a subsystem therefore,

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:57.920
because a subsystem is always a part, but rather as an independent system, which is connected by

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:10.320
means of the tube. So here ends the first lesson. Let me get back to the main track.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:22.640
We'll come back to most of that later on. This is Yorbsland Weber who taught me a lot about systems.

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:27.920
That's the book where we express this complicated theory of systems, complex system.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:32.640
Now let's talk about Max Schäler. Max Schäler was a very interesting character. So he was the

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:41.040
Catholic Nietzsche, they say. That was how he was described. In other words, he was very,

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:50.800
what's the word, conspicuous. He wasn't a dedicated follower of fashion. He was a creator of fashion.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:56.800
So during the First World War, he was the leading spokesman for the anti-British

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:04.960
campaign, because the British are just grossers. So we can't take them seriously. They have no

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:14.960
spirit, no geist. And so it's okay to beat them in a war. And he was a Catholic at various

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:22.080
points in his life, but then when he unconverted himself and then reconverted himself. And some

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:26.320
of the times when he was unconverted, he was also a professor of Catholic theology in the

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:33.520
University of Cologne. His sex life was very complicated. I can't remember the

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:40.720
I can't remember the whole story, but the one story which I do remember is that on the morning of

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:49.200
one of his marriages, he wrote, sent a telegram to another woman, explaining that she was the only

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:56.160
woman that he ever loved in his life. Which is also not true. I mean that she was the only woman.

01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:02.080
Anyway, so it's very, there is a very nice biography by a man called Staud S-T-A-U-D-D

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:10.000
on Shayla's life, which I recommend. But his philosophy is, it's all over the place.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:17.360
He hasn't been popular in the analytic world as much as he should have been given the good

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:22.560
stuff in Shayla, because there is a lot of embarrassing stuff in Shayla. And I'm going to

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:29.840
try and communicate some of the good stuff. So, and I have Voitywa in yellow here, that's because

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:37.440
some of the good stuff is manifest in Voitywa, who wrote his habitation on Shayla.

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:49.360
All right. Now, Shayla's idea, one of Shayla's main ideas is hysteria of feelings and emotions

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:55.440
and values. Now, it's clear that feelings can be of positive or negative value. So,

01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:03.440
a pain is of negative value or negative valence, we can say. And a feeling of joy is a positive value.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:14.880
But Shayla made a very elaborate technology of values and emotions out of these associations

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:22.080
between certain kinds of feelings and certain kinds of values. He said the only way we can

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:31.040
experience a value is via feeling. So, we don't have intellectual knowledge of values. We have,

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:39.680
let's say, value instances. We know when there is a value there, if we have a corresponding

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:49.600
feeling about what we see or hear. And so, if you see somebody torturing a helpless infant

01:29:49.920 --> 01:30:01.120
and you don't feel badness, then that's because you are value-blind. And I think there's some

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:07.840
truth in this. Some people are value-blind. Pathology is a kind of value-blindness. Psychopathology,

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:14.320
the psychopath is somebody who is value-blind with regard to social values of various sorts.

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:20.080
All right. So, Shayla's idea is that the way we access values is through emotions.

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:25.360
And that means that we, sorry, the way we access values is through emotions. And that means that

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:33.920
we can categorize values by looking at the kinds of feelings that they incite. And so,

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:41.200
sensible feelings like itches and smells and so forth, they relate to rather short,

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:47.920
lived values, which are easy to fix, easy to change. So, if you have a toothache, then

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:54.160
if you take an aspirin, then you may, if you're lucky, be able to change it. So,

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:58.960
you can, there's a mechanical means to change these things. And this means that they are very

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:06.080
low in the value of value. Then we have what he calls vital feelings, which are bigger and

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:12.560
strengthened on the positive side and tiredness and weakness. So, you can see nature coming in here

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:22.320
on the negative side. Then we have psychic feeling states, such as euphoria and happiness and sympathy

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:32.400
and sorrow and anger and jealousy. And these come forth in all kinds of interesting psychosocial

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:41.520
phenomena like love and hate and empathy and so forth. And we can alter them through acts of

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:48.800
free will and through positive social interactions, he said. And then at the very top, we have spiritual

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:56.160
feelings, which are somehow absolute. They don't belong to the ego anymore. And the examples he

01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:01.360
likes are all religious ones, bliss or wonder, catharsis on the positive side and then shame,

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:09.920
despair, remorse, anxiety, conscience and grief on the negative side. And these we can't usually

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:21.280
manipulate. If we have a feeling of bliss, then that's by the grace of God. It's not anything that

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:31.920
we can engineer. And we can't will ourselves to be in a state of awe. Either it happens or it doesn't.

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:39.280
And so, from this, we get hierarchy of values. So, we started at the bottom. There are utility

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:47.360
values, which of course, don't matter to us just for the British. Then there are sensual feelings,

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:54.640
which meant to things being agreeable or disagreeable. And then we have feeling states of the lived body,

01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:01.680
which are correspond to mental values and vital values that I told earlier. And then psychic

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:07.920
feeling states correspond to mental values and spiritual feeling states correspond to the values

01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:19.760
of the holy and the unholy. And this gives you a hierarchy. So, we have sacred at the top,

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:30.560
then wisdom, then virtue and then utility. All right. So, so much for this is Sheva's

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:38.880
big book, 600 pages or so. The idea is that formalism in ethics is the kind of ethics which

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:45.680
can be captured in axioms like the categorical imperative of Kant, which Sheva hated. So,

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:52.400
he thought that that's much too formalistic, much too intellectualistic values have to do with,

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:59.040
and therefore ethics have to do with feelings. The feelings are the basis of ethics. And the

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:05.360
get-out then is precisely something that will suffer from a violent line. So, the usual argument

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:09.600
against the view that feelings are the basis of ethics is that some people don't have the right

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:23.200
ethical feelings. And there is a very nice treatment of Fender's theory of the human world,

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:30.640
which I've linked to the wiki page. So, Fender was another member of the Munich school. In the book

01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:36.880
on AI, we have a section on Sheva's theory of the will. But since we wrote the book,

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:43.280
I found this paper, and it is in fact a better account of the Munich understanding of will,

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:50.160
and therefore also of emotions. All right. So, this is Sheva's account, not Fender's account

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:58.560
of will. So, a man, I could have been a woman, but a man sees a drowning child and experiences a

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:05.920
feeling, it has to be a feeling, of moral obligation to save the child, and wills himself to save the

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:12.800
child and jumps in. And then Shaila says that we have overlapping stages, and we need to understand

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:19.280
the will by looking at these overlapping stages. We get the same change, stages, wherever action

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:25.120
occurs, in other words, because action always occurs on the basis of some act of will. So,

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:31.760
these are the stages, and Fender's theory is more detailed than this, and I think better also,

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:38.240
but this won't do for here. So, there is a presence to the acting person of the object,

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:43.840
the baby falling in the lake. A presence in the mind of the acting person, we could see a safe

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:51.200
guys, of the content to be realized, and of the sending value feelings, value feelings,

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:58.080
he feels that he has to jump in. And then there is a decision, and the decision that the actor

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:05.840
deciding of three parts, there's forming intention, deliberating how to affect the rest, so once you

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:11.680
decide you're going to rescue the baby, then you need to decide how you do that, and whether you'll

01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:18.400
call the police first. And then the third part is the most important part, that's when you resolve,

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:26.320
that's a mental act of resolving, but that takes place at the same time as molecular

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:35.360
signaling events in your brain. And Shayla is, for this reason, as for many others,

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:40.720
to be taken seriously, even today, because he was never a Cartesian Jewelist. He always believed in

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:47.520
the mind, body, as being one thing rather than two things. So, these two things are both happening

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:52.880
simultaneously, and they are in some sense, they're two sides of the same coin, and that is where the

01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:59.280
will actually kicks in, where you have a connection between the relevant parts of the decision and

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:08.960
the actual triggering of the event. And it would look like this, or so this is stage three C up here,

01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:18.080
and that's stage four, but they're connected by nerves. And there's nothing here that we

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:25.440
can predict. So, one of the reasons why we can have no AI will, which Yorkson and I have argued

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:33.040
at length now, is because we'd have to predict that there would be this simultaneous decision,

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:39.760
and in the case of the AI, there's going to be a mechanical effect. And we can't do that in the

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:46.000
way which corresponds to what we understand as will when we are human beings willing. And Turing,

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.960
so in other words, we can have no mathematical model of this. And Turing says that we can only

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:56.240
model what we can describe mathematically. Now, the reason why will is so important for AI

01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:04.560
is the same as the reason why we still, after 50 years, have no working chat box. AI can't do ordinary

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:08.960
everyday conversation. And the reason why it can't do ordinary everyday conversations, because

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:15.920
ordinary everyday conversation is soaked through with acts of will. We engage in conversation

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.320
because we want something. Immediately that we engage and we want something else because of the

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:25.440
response. And that the will ties what ties the conversation together. And that's why you hate

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:31.200
calling your bank on the phone, because there's no will. It's a tie you together.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:38.960
All right, now, so the life world, I will talk about this at some other stage.

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:43.200
I don't think we need to go into this really.

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:48.480
Yeah, so we'll do this one. So

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:54.800
both Hussal and Shayla were, even though they were interested in the real world,

01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:58.160
even Hussal was interested in the real world in his early writings,

01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:04.000
we're not really interested in physics, or in chemistry, or in the sciences of the real world.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:15.520
So, Hussal, sorry, Shayla used the term me lia to refer to the life world that we are living in,

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:23.200
which is a kind of simplified chamber, which extends as far as we can see,

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.360
and as far as we can influence, but it's not the real world because it has rules of its own.

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:33.920
So he says, the sun of the media, human beings is not the sun of astronomy, the meat that is stolen

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:39.600
bought on what have you is not the sum of cells and tissues with the chemical physical processes

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.920
which take place within them. Now, of course, he's just wrong

01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:54.240
that that meat contains molecules. If somebody asks you to give you a drink that doesn't contain

01:39:54.240 --> 01:40:01.040
any chemicals, then you know that they are wrong because every drink contains nothing but chemicals.

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:10.160
All right, so now this is another piece of history. So, when I first arrived in

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:17.520
Buffalo, the chair was a close friend of the previous chairman called Marvin Farber,

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:24.240
who was one of the leading phenomenologists in the United States, and he wrote a book on Hussal,

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:31.920
he hired phenomenologists, and the man who started this Marvin Farber lectures,

01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:38.400
I think I was the only person who gave him that lecture. He wanted me to talk about

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:45.120
European philosophy, he had lectures, so I agreed. And so we started with Brentano,

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:53.520
who was the teacher of Hussal and responsible also for Polish philosophy and for Ustaz psychology

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:59.360
and many other things, that's where we start and the influence of Brentano on the Vienna circle.

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:04.080
And then Wittgenstein and the poets, I've forgotten what I had to say in that particular lecture,

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:10.000
but I do have the tapes somewhere. And then Kafka and the philosopher, so I've written about

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:17.920
Kafka and Brentano. Kafka attended lectures in philosophy and was known to philosophers,

01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:22.560
he was known to them, they were known to him, although they didn't know about his

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:27.760
novels because they were written later. And then I have a chapter on Wojtyła,

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:36.720
Kazimierz Fardowski was Brentano's leading light in Poland. And then we have Hussal Heidegger

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:42.160
and the Crisis of European Sciences, I missed some out, so this is a shortened version of a

01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:50.720
longer list. Then there's an lecture on the ink garden, then it begins to become even more

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:57.440
controversial, from Jürgen Hallermas to the Barden-Meinhof gang, and then the final lecture

01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:06.000
was called Daring down the Suicide of Philosophical Reason. And the short form is writing to death.

01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:14.720
And so the reason why I bring this up is because during this period I was actually

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:21.680
working on the philosophy of Karol Wojtyła. And this fits because it draws exactly on the

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:28.000
theory of the will of Sheila. So Wojtyła wrote a book,

01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:39.600
the title is Person and Act, but an English translation was created which is somewhat

01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:46.000
controversial because the translation involved parts which were not written by Wojtyła, they were

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:53.920
written by the translator, who claims in a very famous series of journalistic excitement events

01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:59.840
a few years ago that she was involved with Wojtyła. And there was something going on between the two

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:04.720
of them, but I'm sure it was not anything, it could probably be called love, at least not

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:12.640
in his direction. Anyway, so there is now a new version of this book, I don't know whether it's

01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:16.400
in English, but there is a new version in, well actually this looks as if it is in English.

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:23.120
This is part of the English critical edition of the works in Karol Wojtyła, volume one in fact,

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:32.080
so Person and Act. So Wojtyła was a philosophy student and a philosophy professor actually,

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:37.360
as well as being a priest. And in order to become a professor in most countries in Europe you have

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:43.360
to do two dissertations, one is the doctrine and the other is called a habitation, it's just a

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:53.680
thick doctrine and in France thick means a thousand pages. And the story I like to tell is that every

01:43:53.680 --> 01:44:00.720
German philosophy professor has to write at least two books, one is on Hegel and the other is on

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:12.480
Hegel. And well Sheila was the main topic of Wojtyła's habitation, but Aquinas is playing a role

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:19.840
also because Wojtyła was a priest and so philosophy for priests is Aquinas and Cometries on Aquinas.

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:28.800
So it's a study of the human person, now Ingaarden talked about Strafer of the literary work

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:33.680
and Ingaarden Wojtyła were friends, so I'm sure that there was some interaction between them

01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:39.280
in the English translation of the acting person, the original one, I haven't read the new one.

01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:47.600
The word structure is used, but many of the passages suggest that stratum would be more

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:55.840
appropriate as we will see. So there are strata of the human person which are common to all persons

01:44:55.840 --> 01:45:01.440
and to all human action and his book is about the strata. Jesus Christ is not mentioned anywhere

01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:07.120
in the book, theology is not mentioned anywhere in the book, truth is mentioned and you know what

01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:15.840
he means when he talks about truth, but he's not talking about what he means. And so Reinach has

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:24.720
an important distinction in his theory of speech acts. So there are two kinds of speech acts,

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:32.960
one kind of speech act, sorry there are two kinds of uses of language, one kind of use of language,

01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:41.120
you're just speaking, you're not trying to act in such a way that the person you're speaking to

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:47.280
will be changed. So if someone says what time is it, you say four o'clock then that's not really a

01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:56.880
speech act. So the difference has to do with what Reinach calls upon, phase doings of a person.

01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:06.720
So like kissing or kicking or choosing and deciding, these are internal doings and speech acts are

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:12.560
both internal and external, they're internal because they involve you willing to act in a

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:18.400
certain way, but they're external because you act by speaking and that you're speaking to someone

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:26.320
else you want to change that other person. So this distinction between what merely happens in

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:33.520
person and what is a spontaneous doing of that person is the core of pointy words, account of

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:42.560
the human person. So these strata are what he calls enduring dynamic centers. So we're constantly

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:47.760
acting but on different levels and we're constantly having things go on inside our body on different

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:56.160
levels including physical things like blood flow and so forth, breathing and the trick is to try

01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:04.960
to unify all of these dynamic strata and of course sometimes you fail and in working to

01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:16.400
unify all your dynamic strata you create yourself. So acting, he says, is the first of many

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:26.160
dynamisms, it's conscious and but consciousness too is a dynamism so already action involves

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:31.920
another strata which is a conscious strata, you can be conscious without acting and when you act

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:36.080
you are conscious that you're acting but the action belongs to a different dynamism

01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:42.400
from the consciousness and then they both depend upon various bodily dynamisms and then the question

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:50.800
is how do you how do you unify all of these dynamisms and these are five. So when we act

01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:56.240
we experience our action as a doing of which we are the entity because we who are acting

01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:04.160
we're causally responsible. We are aware that it reflects certain conscious processes called

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:11.920
desires typically that sometimes it's a bearer of a moral value or disvalue and then he says

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:18.480
that a drama of good and evil within ourselves which is another kind of dynamism and it reflects also

01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:29.120
so I'm not sure what he means here these I think are his words so I think it means that

01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:35.120
it reflects your consciousness of other actions that you've been taking and then it reflects and is

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:40.560
entwined with the external reality in which the action takes place including the external

01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:45.040
reality of the other person that you are acting in relation to and of all their

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:51.840
and then the problem that there is this dynamism of feelings and emotions you see

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:57.520
see how Shayla is playing a role here I'm not going to go through this the problem is that the

01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:03.760
harmony sometimes break so you may have an over-emotionalized consciousness and then there's

01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:10.160
a struggle struggle between the intense emotions which affect your consciousness and your consciousness

01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:17.360
so and that's where if you're lucky conscience will kicks in but sometimes consciousness losing

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:27.360
and then you the person as unity disintegrates and says and freedom you can't be free when

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:33.600
your personality is disintegrated that's what he says here freedom presupposes self-prediction

01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:39.920
and freedom therefore presupposes a reference to truth and then there's a long passage here

01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:46.640
about conscious conscience so consciousness is another dynamic dynamism which serves to control

01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:57.040
over the goodness of the badness of our action so and now this the one interesting aspect is

01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:05.360
that he thinks that this creates a solution to the mind body problem and so the mental and

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:09.760
bodily dynamisms are brought to a unity on a higher level constituted by the dynamisms of

01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:19.760
human action so human action brings the two together and I'm quoting him now when he says

01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:28.880
all men he means all human beings in German the word mensch they mean mensch but that means human

01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:34.880
being but it's often translated as millions we will see all right so now we have the we dealt

01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:41.920
with the Shayla school I still have a lot to say but I'll do it quickly so the Louvain school

01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:47.520
that this priest rescued Husserl's archives from the Nazis took them to Belgium and hid them away

01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:53.680
and created the Husserl archive which still exists and there are 40 something volumes

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:59.680
in the collected works which is nothing compared to Heidegger then there is the Liechtenstein

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:06.160
school and this is going very quick so Liechtenstein is here it's 62 square miles and it has its own

01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:14.720
prince who is the sovereign and he's a real prince and Buffalo has 52 square miles I lived in Liechtenstein

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:21.360
for four years I was a professor of philosophy this is the royal family of Liechtenstein this is the

01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:27.920
royal castle Liechtenstein this is the international academy of philosophy it's now called the

01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:33.040
University of Liechtenstein but then it was a very small scale thing it didn't even occupy

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:39.280
this much in the building and I wasn't professor anymore when they moved into this building which

01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:47.200
is very hard to reach I could tell you stories about this building but I won't now why was I in

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:57.840
Liechtenstein well on June 14th 1975 I gave my first ever talk to an international meeting

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:05.280
in Krakow in 1975 Krakow was a communist country I had already visited many communist countries but

01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:11.280
it was not by any means trivial for an Englishman to visit communist countries it was a bit like

01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:19.760
traveling to Europe when Covid was raining I managed to do it but it was not trivial now so

01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:25.200
I go to this meeting and I give a talk on Romain ingarden and the aesthetics of mathematical objects

01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:32.800
and see that's my dissertation and I can't remember what I said but all of the three

01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:41.360
international speakers of this meeting were invited to the Cardinals powers in Krakow which is this

01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:52.480
and so the Cardinal was Vaitiwa so I had dinner with Vaitiwa that's now this man was the creator

01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:57.840
of the international academy in philosophy he knew that I had dinner with Vaitiwa but more

01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:03.120
importantly and it's important because Liechtenstein is a very Catholic country this is a very

01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:11.680
Catholic person he was the head of it that the academy was devoted to the philosophy of Vaitiwa

01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:17.440
and to the Polish and Munich he was part of the Munich school very late part

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:25.360
so the Munich Polish precursors of Vaitiwa philosophy and he knew that I was the world's

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:30.400
expert on Reinhacht in England so he made me a professor and so I moved to Liechtenstein

01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:39.440
and Liechtenstein is a very beautiful country two percent taxes and it's in the mountains

01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:44.320
and in the middle of everywhere anyway so there is this Liechtenstein branch of philosophy

01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:50.720
Dietrich von Hildebrandt was indeed a member of the original Munich school and Zeifert was his

01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:54.880
student I'm not going to talk about Zeifert's philosophy you can read about it if you wish

01:53:55.520 --> 01:54:02.880
I thought I would do another chat GPT trip so this Zeifert wrote a book on the philosophy of chess

01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:10.080
which I think is his greatest work it's quite short and this is how it's described in his German

01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:15.520
wiki page for some reason he doesn't have an English wiki page the German wiki page is very

01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:22.080
long and very serious so I think there's been a misprint somewhere a misconnection so this is

01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:27.920
just the paragraph about his chess philosophy so I tried in Google translate and it doesn't get

01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:34.480
everything right so it says goes in the direction of an objective a priori of the nominal essential

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:40.240
all than empirically given ones necessary circumstances can be exceeded so about here

01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:47.360
Google translators gave up and generated nonsense probably that's where they kick in

01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:54.080
chatting critique deep L which is a German translation engine better than Google does

01:54:54.080 --> 01:55:00.800
better I'm not going to read this but it it's clearly much too long the sentence so no good

01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:07.760
English translation would ever have a sentence which is this long so I did a translation this is

01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:16.080
the relevant passage in the deep L but I improved it so I cut I cut most of it he shows also the

01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:20.880
cast conception of a general a priori I can be improved by stinging from an objective a priori

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:26.160
at the central walls from empirically given necessary states for chess about chess and things

01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:38.800
like that so now finally Heidegger he really is a funny man so in being in time Heidegger according

01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:45.840
to this the standard in a psychopedic philosophy Heidegger rejects the Hosellian and that means

01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:54.480
the Munich notion of formal ontology transforming it into a fundamental ontology which is a

01:55:54.480 --> 01:56:00.400
neo Aristotelian serve for what it is that unites and makes possible our varied and diverse senses

01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:06.560
of what it is to be I think the English of this is quite good I'm not sure anyone can understand

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:13.680
it for them English is quite good and it shows that there was a kind of break even early Heidegger

01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:21.840
was still infused by Shayla things there's a lot of the tone of voice of Shayla in the early Heidegger

01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:29.680
and Hosell himself in his copy of Heidegger's being in time says that his formal ontology

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:35.680
is shifted into the anthropological all problematic he's shifting over corresponding to the ego which

01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:42.880
is the formal this thing there is Dasein and no one knows what that is in the way that everything

01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:55.120
becomes ponderously unclear and philosophically loses its value and then Galen so Galen he's

01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:02.960
he's a follower of Shayla the Second World War got in the way of being him being counted as a member

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:10.320
of the he got in the way of a lot of things but he wrote a book called which in the English

01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:17.920
translation is called man but in the German it's just damage so he was writing about human beings

01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:25.440
which until a few years ago everyone would assume as a matter of course so damage his nature

01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:33.600
how would you say that in the human being you can't say its nature and its place in the world

01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:42.560
and chapter sorry the third part ends with a section on the Geist problem that we talked about last

01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:49.280
week or two weeks ago all right so the background of Galen's work it's a really big and very

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:54.400
interesting work around a book around lots of things and there is a copy of both the German

01:57:54.400 --> 01:58:00.800
and the English translation in the university library which is a very good sign of how good

01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:06.320
the library is here and that's not just my view there's always good library Marvin Farber I think

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:13.760
was responsible for the quality of the university collection here all right so three aspects to

01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:21.520
his work Shayla primatism and philosophical anthropology and so his first idea is that humans

01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:30.640
what in German is called mengelwesen which means deficient entities so cats and dogs and

01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:35.680
pigs they they are not deficient entities they have a wonderful life in their ancestral

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:42.240
environment and they never have to worry they that's because they have very very powerful

01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:46.800
instincts they don't have to think at all they just behave instinctively humans have very weak

01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:53.760
instincts we've lost most of our instincts so we have to make up for this loss and what this means

01:58:53.840 --> 01:59:01.680
is that we have to use our weak sensory and motor abilities to change the environment to suit our

01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:09.120
needs and that means we can live in many different kinds of environments we are as Galen says and

01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:16.160
this is a term which Shayla also uses we have world openness so we can plan how we're going to

01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:20.960
behave we can plan what kind of environment we behave in we can build a new environment we can

01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:26.560
invent new kinds of environments and so forth so game playing games are new kinds of environments

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:32.480
we have these devices called chessboards and so forth new kinds of tourism new kinds of travel

01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:39.680
spaceships astrobiology we can live in a world which includes also possible bacteria in distant

01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:46.640
galaxies and we do all of these things so a rat wouldn't do any of that because do the same thing

01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:56.080
every day we have an excess drive we always want to we go to philosophy lecture we read Arnold

01:59:56.080 --> 02:00:02.240
Galen we do all kinds of things we do always new things and there's no equilibrium we never are

02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:11.040
settled we die eventually but while we're alive it's always something new and that's why we need

02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:19.600
institutions so uh the the um i want i s

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:29.280
that this is going to be the last night so we need institutions which are cultural not natural

02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:35.280
because if we don't have institutions then we we're lost because we have such weak instincts

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:42.640
so we have institutions to create things like roads and electricity and electricity supply and so

02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:52.080
all those services maybe even tree services but that means that we are by nature cultural being

02:00:55.600 --> 02:01:00.400
that is the deep thought i mean if you're teaching the course on nature and culture

02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:06.320
that is the deep thought and the part of Galen's argument for this thought

02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:13.040
is that we don't know of any human beings who did not have cultural attainments the very earliest

02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:19.600
societies are precisely societies with institutions and buildings and so and no matter how primitive

02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:25.520
we find them they are still these institutions or cultural attainments they are still so fundamental

02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:29.840
the human existence would be i think all without them all right that's the end

02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:35.840
good
