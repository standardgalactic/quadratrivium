WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.300
I'm going to start by explaining something about what ontology is and what it means to

00:08.300 --> 00:10.040
apply ontology.

00:10.040 --> 00:16.740
So I guess everyone knows that ontology is an old sub-discipline of philosophy.

00:16.740 --> 00:20.500
So Aristotle already was doing ontology.

00:20.500 --> 00:24.740
Ontology now is also a branch of computer science.

00:24.740 --> 00:30.820
So when we do digital humanities, then we are confronted very often with images like

00:30.820 --> 00:36.680
this with hairballs representing data that we have about many different things, many

00:36.680 --> 00:39.340
different subjects, many different people and so on.

00:39.340 --> 00:46.680
So this is a hairball representing data about people who are prominent in the digital humanities

00:46.680 --> 00:49.500
who engage on Twitter.

00:49.500 --> 00:52.380
It has no relevance at all to what I say next.

00:52.380 --> 00:57.460
But it's an example of the sort of data that we have, which could in principle be used

00:57.460 --> 00:59.300
for research.

00:59.300 --> 01:03.820
This is an example of political data that we have.

01:03.820 --> 01:10.620
This is an example of how different journals make themselves felt, different humanities

01:10.620 --> 01:15.660
and social science journals make themselves felt in Twitter again.

01:15.660 --> 01:20.880
So there's lots of data like this and we could in principle use this data for interesting

01:20.880 --> 01:23.160
research purposes.

01:23.160 --> 01:29.440
And I just mentioned that data like this is being used all the time by people in biology

01:29.440 --> 01:33.960
and medicine and similar subjects using ontologies.

01:33.960 --> 01:39.120
So what can they do, which could also be done with data like this?

01:39.120 --> 01:43.240
That's the question or the challenge that I'm going to address.

01:43.240 --> 01:52.680
Now one way of addressing this challenge is to create what are called linked open data.

01:52.680 --> 01:59.080
And the idea here is that if you have data about a specific subject, then that will be

01:59.080 --> 02:02.520
described using certain terms.

02:02.520 --> 02:08.840
And if you can organize these terms into a representation of the data, then you can link

02:08.840 --> 02:13.040
it to other such organized representations of data.

02:13.040 --> 02:19.040
In such a way that you can then reason across the data, you can draw conclusions from it.

02:19.040 --> 02:24.560
And these are the areas which form this linked open data cloud.

02:24.560 --> 02:30.960
This is basically a happy hunting ground for hackers who like to join data from different

02:30.960 --> 02:31.960
areas.

02:31.960 --> 02:37.120
So they use the linked open data cloud as a key to combining data.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.760
And you can see there's too much of it.

02:39.760 --> 02:46.840
It's very unlikely that you're going to create useful connections between data, which you

02:46.840 --> 02:51.560
can use for research, unless you're a hacker.

02:51.560 --> 02:54.720
So there's no way this can be done easily.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.200
So you can read this.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.200
You couldn't read.

02:58.200 --> 03:01.200
This is a very early version of the linked open data cloud.

03:01.200 --> 03:06.560
Now many of these modules within the linked open data cloud are ontologies.

03:06.560 --> 03:10.920
So there's one up in the right hand corner called ontoworld.

03:10.920 --> 03:16.000
I have no idea what that is, but it's an example of this kind of thing that you find in the

03:16.000 --> 03:18.260
linked open data cloud.

03:18.260 --> 03:22.760
This is an illustration of the freedom of the internet.

03:22.760 --> 03:28.040
Anybody can add a new ontology or a new module to the linked open data cloud.

03:28.040 --> 03:33.040
So I think the stuff on the left includes music ontologies, for instance.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.840
I don't like that because it only works for hackers.

03:35.840 --> 03:41.200
It only works for people who are willing to spend their days and their nights trying to

03:41.200 --> 03:48.160
glue together very, very large numbers of data representations in useful ways.

03:48.160 --> 03:54.240
If you're a hacker and if you know a lot about specific kinds of data, you can get real value

03:54.240 --> 04:01.640
from the linked open data and from data, PDA and similar storehouses of data.

04:01.640 --> 04:08.600
But I'm not a hacker and I'm assuming that not everyone on the call is a hacker and certainly

04:08.600 --> 04:15.680
none of us is an expert on many of the areas of data that they might want to relate to.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.960
That's the interestingness of new research.

04:18.960 --> 04:23.720
You can try to engage with data in areas where you are not an expert.

04:23.720 --> 04:27.000
You can't do that with the linked open data method.

04:27.320 --> 04:32.920
The ontology method is more general than linked open data.

04:32.920 --> 04:40.400
You can think of an ontology as a computable lexicon, sometimes called a controlled vocabulary.

04:40.400 --> 04:47.000
The lexicon represents the types of entities in a given domain where you have data.

04:47.000 --> 04:55.920
The idea is that if people use controlled vocabularies that are public, consensus-based lexical resources,

04:55.920 --> 05:01.720
then everybody will be able to find the data they need rather easily because they can look

05:01.720 --> 05:06.760
in the catalogs of the controlled vocabularies and they can see where all the data about

05:06.760 --> 05:15.480
viruses might be found or where all the data about Thai politics or Japanese cooking or

05:15.480 --> 05:16.800
whatever it might be.

05:16.800 --> 05:21.240
If you have controlled vocabularies for each of these areas, then this makes combining

05:21.240 --> 05:25.440
data more easy.

05:25.840 --> 05:30.720
Ontology is a method for creating controlled vocabularies of this sort, which are useful

05:30.720 --> 05:38.880
both to humans and to people, and to humans and to computers.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.400
That's what an ontology is.

05:40.400 --> 05:47.240
It happens that UB is probably the world centre of ontology, at least measured by our impacts

05:47.240 --> 05:50.400
and by the number of ontologies which are maintained here.

05:50.400 --> 05:55.360
The grant funding that we've been receiving over the years, the number of faculties where

05:55.360 --> 05:59.240
we have ontologists working, and so forth.

05:59.240 --> 06:06.680
But the origins of ontology go back to the 1980s, and you see the name Tom Gruber here.

06:06.680 --> 06:15.720
He is the most famous person in the early stages of ontology, and he's interesting today

06:15.720 --> 06:25.240
because he is the inventor of the Siri app in your iPhone, which is based on ontologies.

06:25.280 --> 06:30.080
Siri contains ontologies of restaurants, of movies.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.440
This is what an ontology inside Siri looks like.

06:33.440 --> 06:41.120
You have the names of the general types that you want to capture, types like city or state

06:41.120 --> 06:46.760
or zip code, and then you have instances of those types, which are the particular cities

06:46.760 --> 06:51.480
or states or zip codes where you might find restaurants or movies or whatever it might

06:51.480 --> 06:52.480
be.

06:52.480 --> 06:56.400
So this is a characteristic split in ontology land.

06:56.400 --> 07:02.800
You have ontologies which are about universals, about general types, and then you have particulars

07:02.800 --> 07:05.880
which are the instances of those general types.

07:05.880 --> 07:11.720
And the Siri app is constantly growing with more and more data about restaurants and movies

07:11.720 --> 07:19.640
and so forth, so that you can work out where you want to eat before you go to a movie tonight.

07:19.640 --> 07:23.600
And what we're doing in biology is very similar.

07:23.600 --> 07:32.360
So in biology, we have types like virus or coronavirus or SARS virus or COVID-19 virus.

07:32.360 --> 07:37.400
These are all types, and then we have many, many instances in all the people who have

07:37.400 --> 07:40.440
the corresponding diseases.

07:40.440 --> 07:44.000
So there are journals devoted to ontology now.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.720
One of these journals existed before the turn of the century.

07:49.720 --> 07:56.360
There is a journal of biomedical semantics, which is about ontology of biomedicine.

07:56.360 --> 08:04.480
Now in around the year 2000, with the conclusion of the human genome project, ontologies became

08:04.480 --> 08:12.800
really important in biology and in medicine because the genomic data which was being discovered

08:12.800 --> 08:17.320
is just huge sequences of chemical letters, letters of the alphabet.

08:17.320 --> 08:24.960
It doesn't have any connection to the biological and medical things which are important, like

08:24.960 --> 08:33.120
viruses or diseases or lungs or cell division or any of these other things which belong

08:33.120 --> 08:34.720
to the old biology.

08:34.720 --> 08:41.720
And the gene ontology, which is by far the most successful ontology in any domain, is

08:41.720 --> 08:50.440
an ontology of old biology which was used systematically to tag sequences, gene sequences,

08:50.440 --> 08:57.040
protein sequences, other kinds of sequences, and it thereby made sequence data usable to

08:57.040 --> 09:01.200
people who wanted to do old biology or old medicine.

09:01.200 --> 09:05.320
In other words, they wanted to study things like diseases.

09:05.320 --> 09:12.080
Now so this is the paper in which the gene ontology was presented to the world.

09:12.080 --> 09:20.200
It's been cited some 30,000 times, very influential, and the idea then led to copies.

09:20.200 --> 09:27.160
People wanted to have ontologies for other parts of biology and for other areas.

09:27.160 --> 09:36.720
So the people around the gene ontology who built these ontologies created an initiative

09:36.720 --> 09:42.280
called the oboe foundry, the open biological and biomedical ontologies foundry.

09:42.280 --> 09:46.120
I was one of the founders of this foundry.

09:46.120 --> 09:52.160
They wanted originally to call it the smithy, but I vetoed that suggestion.

09:52.160 --> 09:56.920
And you can see that the first ontology in the list of oboe foundry ontologies is called

09:56.920 --> 09:58.840
basic formal ontology.

09:58.840 --> 10:04.040
This is the top level ontology which joins all the other ontologies together within the

10:04.040 --> 10:06.080
oboe foundry as a whole.

10:06.080 --> 10:09.160
That ontology was more or less my creation.

10:09.160 --> 10:13.120
That was 20 years ago.

10:13.120 --> 10:18.240
And then this is a paper in which we capture the methodology for building consistent ontologies

10:18.240 --> 10:21.000
across the whole domain of biomedicine.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.680
This is in 2007.

10:23.680 --> 10:29.360
Already in that year, the oboe foundry was beginning to show its successes in many areas

10:29.360 --> 10:31.840
of biology and is still doing so.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.080
All right.

10:33.080 --> 10:37.360
So one way in which these ontologies are used is to tag literature.

10:37.360 --> 10:46.200
So the colors here represent tags between phrases in a text and ontologies which have

10:46.200 --> 10:49.160
been created for the domains treated in the text.

10:49.160 --> 10:56.000
This is a bit like tagging sequence data, but now you're tagging textual data.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
And so that you can see it more clearly now when I've made the type bigger.

11:01.000 --> 11:08.840
So the infection in the top right which is red is tagged red because it's tagged by

11:08.840 --> 11:15.400
a term from the disease ontology which is indicated in the list of tabs at the top.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.400
All right.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.800
So now we tag sequence data.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.760
We tag other kinds of data.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.040
We tag clinical notes.

11:22.040 --> 11:27.080
We tag literature in the abstract databases and so on.

11:27.080 --> 11:32.240
And thereby we bring together, we create a network out of all of these different kinds

11:32.240 --> 11:36.240
of data using ontology.

11:36.240 --> 11:42.480
And this is just one of many different kinds of portals which enable you to search through

11:42.480 --> 11:46.480
these data source using ontology and to reason over them in different ways.

11:46.480 --> 11:49.920
I'm not going to go into any detail.

11:49.920 --> 11:56.800
This works in biology, works in science generally because scientists have an incentive to use

11:56.800 --> 12:01.760
the same general terms in all the work that they do.

12:01.760 --> 12:05.800
Nobody wants to have multiple terms through the same thing in science.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.880
That is not the way science works.

12:08.880 --> 12:17.320
And the success of modern biology was achieved in large part through the use of common terms

12:17.320 --> 12:24.760
to represent chemical symbols, DNA sequences and so forth.

12:24.760 --> 12:29.680
But in the humanities, things are not like that.

12:29.680 --> 12:36.320
There isn't much greater independence and creativity in terminological usage in the humanities.

12:36.720 --> 12:41.600
In many cases, terms are not logically defined and there is no interest in logical definitions

12:41.600 --> 12:46.760
because that's not what the humanities are primarily interested in.

12:46.760 --> 12:53.080
Humanities, researchers are not doing science in the way that biologists, for instance, are

12:53.080 --> 12:54.080
doing science.

12:54.080 --> 13:00.200
And also there's a lack of ways of testing whether one or other interpretation of a text

13:00.200 --> 13:01.200
is correct.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.480
It could be that multiple interpretations are correct.

13:04.480 --> 13:08.840
But new interpretations are important precisely because they're new.

13:08.840 --> 13:14.160
They throw a new light on what was a text that people thought could be understood in

13:14.160 --> 13:19.640
old ways so that there's a completely different attitude in the humanities.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.640
Now I mentioned basic formal ontology.

13:21.640 --> 13:24.000
This is just a fragment of it.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.760
It has altogether 35 nodes.

13:27.760 --> 13:32.440
These are just a few examples of nodes and the content doesn't matter.

13:32.440 --> 13:35.800
I'm just illustrating the way the system works.

13:35.800 --> 13:41.160
One interesting feature of BFO is that it's now an international standard.

13:41.160 --> 13:48.240
So this is the first piece of philosophy that is useful enough to deserve being made into

13:48.240 --> 13:49.720
an international standard.

13:49.720 --> 13:54.400
This took three years of my life to get to the point where it's now been approved as

13:54.400 --> 13:56.400
an international standard.

13:56.400 --> 14:00.680
And that means that in the sciences, but also now in government and administration and

14:00.680 --> 14:06.320
such circles, people use BFO and they have confidence that it's been validated by a very

14:06.320 --> 14:08.880
strict process.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.120
So this is BFO.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.560
Now why is BFO important?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.920
Because we can extend it.

14:14.920 --> 14:20.800
So this is an extension of BFO into the realm of mental functioning, things like thinking,

14:20.800 --> 14:22.680
planning, learning, and so forth.

14:22.680 --> 14:27.760
And then we can extend that further to include emotions.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.600
So this is a fragment of the emotion ontology.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.600
And you see that we have behavioral processes.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.680
We have subjective feelings.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.440
We have action tendencies.

14:38.440 --> 14:44.160
These are all parts of standard ways of viewing emotions.

14:44.160 --> 14:51.520
And what the emotion ontology gives you is a control of vocabulary or describing emotions.

14:51.520 --> 14:56.800
And so you can use this control of vocabulary to tag data coming from different sources,

14:56.800 --> 15:03.400
which may be from psychology, but it may also be from literature or history, or it may also

15:03.400 --> 15:06.240
be from studying texts, for instance.

15:06.240 --> 15:15.280
So this is a consensus-based control of vocabulary for tagging all kinds of data, all kinds of

15:15.280 --> 15:19.680
texts and so on about emotions.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.640
And so this is what it looks like.

15:21.640 --> 15:27.000
So emotion is based on some sort of appraisal.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.760
An appraisal is a kind of cognitive representation.

15:30.760 --> 15:35.800
And there are different kinds of appraisals which are shown around the circle here.

15:35.800 --> 15:41.120
So there is an appraisal of social attention, appraisal of loss, appraisal of avoidability,

15:41.120 --> 15:42.760
and so forth.

15:42.760 --> 15:46.800
Depending on the appraisal, we have a different kind of emotion.

15:46.800 --> 15:51.800
Sometimes we have emotions spontaneously, and we don't cognitively come to any awareness

15:51.800 --> 15:52.800
of the appraisal.

15:52.800 --> 15:58.600
But there's an appraisal going on somehow, even if not in this particular moment.

15:58.600 --> 16:05.960
And then we have types of physiological response to emotion.

16:05.960 --> 16:09.080
So our muscles relax, our muscles become tense.

16:09.080 --> 16:14.160
We breathe at a slower rate, we breathe at a more rapid rate, and so on.

16:15.040 --> 16:19.720
So the emotional ontology contains all terms for all of these different kinds of physiological

16:19.720 --> 16:20.720
response.

16:20.720 --> 16:25.360
And then we have different kinds of feelings, feeling nervous, feeling bad, feeling tired,

16:25.360 --> 16:27.080
feeling strong, and so on.

16:27.080 --> 16:33.880
These are documented in the emotional ontology in a consensus-based, consistent way.

16:33.880 --> 16:38.480
Moreover, for all of these terms, and for all the terms in all of the ontology, we

16:38.480 --> 16:43.640
have human definitions, so natural language definitions, so that human beings can understand

16:43.640 --> 16:45.360
what the terms mean.

16:45.360 --> 16:52.600
But we also have logical definitions, so that computers can use these terms as a basis for

16:52.600 --> 16:54.400
computational reasoning.

16:54.400 --> 17:01.120
All right, now, we can now put different ontologies together.

17:01.120 --> 17:05.360
So there is a chemistry ontology called kebi.

17:05.360 --> 17:13.120
And emotions, as people who like drinking alcohol know, are closely related to chemistry.

17:14.120 --> 17:19.240
And so using ontologies, we can build maps of what these relations are.

17:19.240 --> 17:23.440
So happiness, for instance, is an emotion.

17:23.440 --> 17:30.440
And happiness is, in fact, part of a certain kind of neurotransmitter receptor activity,

17:30.440 --> 17:33.080
which is a gene ontology term.

17:33.080 --> 17:41.440
And this neurotransmitter receptor activity is realized, sorry, it has as its realizer

17:41.440 --> 17:47.080
a certain neurotransmitter, which is called dopamine.

17:47.080 --> 17:52.880
So that is linking three ontologies together in order to give an account of what happiness

17:52.880 --> 17:53.880
is.

17:53.880 --> 17:57.040
And whether this is correct or incorrect, it's not so important.

17:57.040 --> 18:01.960
What is important is to see how ontologies can enable you to link data of quite different

18:01.960 --> 18:06.480
sorts in a consistent way.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.960
And this is another story about sadness.

18:08.960 --> 18:14.920
I don't think I will go into this, but you get the idea.

18:14.920 --> 18:21.000
Depression is realized in a certain kind of sadness, which has as part the down-regulation

18:21.000 --> 18:23.080
of the dopaminergic system.

18:23.080 --> 18:29.600
All right, now we can apply this, for instance, to sentiment profiles for religious texts.

18:29.600 --> 18:36.400
We have a canonical vocabulary for describing emotions or sentiments.

18:36.400 --> 18:42.720
And we can use this vocabulary to map certain features of, for instance, religious texts.

18:42.720 --> 18:46.840
So here the Koran is in pink and the Bible is in blue.

18:46.840 --> 18:52.240
And you can see that in these areas, they're pretty much the same.

18:52.240 --> 18:59.200
But so, for instance, joy and anger are very highly expressed in both the Bible and in

18:59.200 --> 19:00.720
the Koran.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.600
But here they disagree.

19:03.600 --> 19:13.240
So the Koran emphasizes much more trust and fear and somewhat more fear and anxiety relative

19:13.240 --> 19:14.720
to the Bible.

19:14.720 --> 19:19.120
All right, so the emotional ontology lives on the web.

19:19.120 --> 19:23.040
You can find it on the bio portal, which is a repository of ontologies.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.880
There are other such repositories.

19:24.880 --> 19:30.680
It's updated slowly by experts, such as me, for instance.

19:30.680 --> 19:36.360
And it's tested in various different kinds of applications, for instance, applications

19:36.360 --> 19:39.960
to understanding how people respond to lectures.

19:39.960 --> 19:46.920
You can have them tick how they feel at certain times during the lecture using an app created

19:46.920 --> 19:49.640
on the basis of the emotional ontology.

19:49.640 --> 19:57.640
So now BFO is much more widely accepted now than it was when it first arose within the

19:57.640 --> 19:59.920
oboe foundry research.

19:59.920 --> 20:07.440
It's now used in some 350 ontology efforts, many of which are in biology and medicine,

20:07.440 --> 20:09.520
but some of which are in other kinds of areas.

20:09.520 --> 20:13.480
And I'll illustrate some of these in a minute.

20:13.480 --> 20:20.040
So the interesting thing is that many of these ontologies are created or co-created or co-managed

20:20.040 --> 20:21.040
here in Buffalo.

20:21.040 --> 20:24.640
So this is just a few of those.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.720
We have the collaborative behavior ontology.

20:27.720 --> 20:33.680
We have a suite of common core ontologies, which are designed to cover a huge array of

20:33.680 --> 20:42.640
areas such as nations, politics, law, government administration, and so on and so on.

20:42.640 --> 20:46.840
Then as you can see, we have the coronavirus infectious disease ontology, which is part

20:46.840 --> 20:54.600
of a whole suite of infectious disease ontologies, which is we've been building here with, in

20:54.600 --> 20:59.720
fact, collaborators in other universities for some 10 years now.

20:59.720 --> 21:04.160
We have a document act ontology, which is about, for instance, the ways in which we

21:04.160 --> 21:12.760
use legal documents in order to perform certain acts, acts of signing or filling in or amending

21:12.760 --> 21:13.760
and so forth.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.640
And you've seen the emotional ontology.

21:16.640 --> 21:22.080
We also have the environment ontology, and at the very bottom, you see the United Nations

21:22.080 --> 21:27.040
Sustainable Development Goals ontology that is based in large part on the environment

21:27.040 --> 21:28.040
ontology.

21:28.040 --> 21:33.840
Then we have the information artifact ontology, which is a kind of ontologization of what

21:33.840 --> 21:41.440
the Dublin core is trying to do with bibliographic and bibliometric terms.

21:41.440 --> 21:46.200
And then we have some more disease ontologies, pain and so forth.

21:46.200 --> 21:51.480
So there are people in, I think, four faculties that you'd be who are working on ontologies.

21:51.480 --> 21:56.840
We have people in engineering, people in the dental school, people in the medical school,

21:56.840 --> 22:03.800
people in the management school, and then we have people in College of Arts and Sciences.

22:03.800 --> 22:08.880
Many of them are working directly with me or they're my students.

22:08.880 --> 22:13.760
Some of them have come to Buffalo independently and then discovered ontology.

22:13.760 --> 22:19.920
And I'm hoping that in the humanities, digital humanities field, we can find new opportunities

22:19.920 --> 22:22.720
for collaborations of this sort.

22:22.720 --> 22:29.560
All right, now there's also a book, which I wrote with two former students, which is

22:29.560 --> 22:33.880
a guidebook to building, well, you can see what it's a guidebook for.

22:33.880 --> 22:39.960
Now let's talk a little bit about what it means to have an international standard.

22:39.960 --> 22:46.440
So the International Standards Organization and the International Electro-Technical Commission

22:46.480 --> 22:52.120
have a joint technical committee, which was the committee which was responsible for the BFO standard.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.360
And one of the things that they do is world plugs.

22:55.360 --> 23:01.000
So if you travel, which some people used to do in the olden times, you need to carry plugs

23:01.000 --> 23:05.840
and it's good to know that the plugs that you carry will fit.

23:05.840 --> 23:11.400
And so the International Electro-Technical Commission ensures that there is a relatively

23:11.400 --> 23:17.560
small number of options for plugs of any given type.

23:17.560 --> 23:26.120
So these are the areas of the globe in which the different types of plugs are used.

23:26.120 --> 23:29.400
And this is a better map.

23:29.400 --> 23:35.000
So you see most of them use the same kind of plug, but not the United States nor the

23:35.000 --> 23:39.360
United Kingdom, both of whom are outliers.

23:39.360 --> 23:44.240
And the reason for the English-speaking world is an outlier.

23:44.240 --> 23:49.600
These are the countries using plugs and sockets to type E.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.320
And so it goes on like this.

23:51.320 --> 23:56.800
Now the reason I'm telling you all of this is because that's what we do when we maintain

23:56.800 --> 23:59.160
a library.

23:59.160 --> 24:05.840
So Dublin Core and before that the Library of Congress had various different kinds of

24:05.840 --> 24:10.160
information that they needed to fit with other kinds of information.

24:10.160 --> 24:14.720
And gradually, as the computer became more important to the workings of a library, it

24:14.720 --> 24:20.320
was necessary to make these various different types of information fit together.

24:20.320 --> 24:23.160
And that's what the Dublin Core tries to do.

24:23.160 --> 24:27.400
Now the Dublin Core is an example of an ontology.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.800
It's a very widely used ontology.

24:29.800 --> 24:33.560
It doesn't have all the qualities that an ontology can have.

24:33.560 --> 24:38.680
So it can't support logical reasoning in the way that, for instance, the gene ontology

24:38.680 --> 24:40.880
or the emotion ontology can.

24:40.880 --> 24:46.920
But still, it's an ontology and it's an ontology which is standardized over many libraries and

24:46.920 --> 24:52.320
helps to make sure the different kinds of information fit, but also that you can find

24:52.320 --> 24:57.840
different kinds of information more easily because they've been standardized in their

24:57.840 --> 24:59.840
typology.

24:59.840 --> 25:07.080
All right, now I did something similar, again with actually the former collaborator, for

25:07.080 --> 25:13.560
philosophy, so creating an ontology philosophy, viewing philosophy now in the old-fashioned

25:13.560 --> 25:18.080
sense according to which philosophy is part of the humanities.

25:18.080 --> 25:21.200
So what would such an ontology look like?

25:21.200 --> 25:26.040
Well, first of all, we can look at the relations.

25:26.040 --> 25:32.200
We've joined together the main kinds of entity, the main types in the philosophical field.

25:32.200 --> 25:38.320
So we have philosophers who are persons, and then we have groups of philosophers, and then

25:38.320 --> 25:45.800
we have the concepts which those philosophers engage with, and then we have fields, fields

25:45.800 --> 25:49.000
and philosophical entities more generally.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.640
And now there are relations between them.

25:50.640 --> 25:53.440
So a person can be a member of a group.

25:53.440 --> 25:56.520
One group can be a subgroup of another group.

25:56.520 --> 26:01.600
A person or a group can work on a concept, and the person or a group can be active in

26:01.600 --> 26:03.200
a field and so on.

26:03.200 --> 26:09.320
So this is not rocket science, this is just trying to make things fit clearly so that

26:09.320 --> 26:14.080
you can keep track of the data that you have in a consistent way.

26:14.080 --> 26:23.280
So these are some examples of relations in the Philonto, so Kant is an instance of philosopher

26:23.280 --> 26:29.480
and concept is a subcategory of philosophical entity and so on.

26:29.480 --> 26:33.640
And then the bottom line here, disjoint concept proposition and so forth, that means that no

26:33.640 --> 26:38.160
concept is a proposition, no proposition is a concept, no concept is a theory, no theory

26:38.160 --> 26:41.480
is a concept and so on.

26:41.480 --> 26:46.680
And then philosophy as a whole is the all-encompassing philosophical field.

26:46.680 --> 26:56.640
So every philosophy is a part, sorry, every philosophical field is a part of the all-encompassing

26:56.640 --> 27:00.680
philosophical field called philosophy.

27:00.680 --> 27:07.760
Now you can't see all of this, but once we start building the ontology it gets very big.

27:07.760 --> 27:15.120
So because we have all these subfields, and if you imagine a gigantic extended graph with

27:15.120 --> 27:20.280
philosophy at the top, and then you have all of these various subfields below it.

27:20.280 --> 27:23.240
So this is just the graph of the subfields of philosophy.

27:23.240 --> 27:32.320
Then we have geographic areas because philosophers lived in certain areas at certain times and

27:32.320 --> 27:38.920
in certain parts of the globe, and so we organized the ontology in such a way that we can capture

27:38.920 --> 27:46.280
these kinds of information too, and that's a very, very simple part of the historical

27:46.280 --> 27:51.560
period and geographical area treatments of the ontology.

27:51.560 --> 27:59.160
And so we can say that Plato is a metaphysician who worked on these arguments here listed

27:59.160 --> 28:01.040
down the right-hand side.

28:01.040 --> 28:05.880
He was a realist about forms, he was an ancient Greek philosopher, and ancient Greeks philosophers

28:05.880 --> 28:12.280
include, is part of both ancient philosophers and Greek philosophers.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.640
So what can we do with this?

28:13.640 --> 28:18.640
Well, we have a map of all philosophers, all philosophers who were listed.

28:18.640 --> 28:21.480
I'll explain where this map comes from in a minute.

28:21.480 --> 28:27.480
So if you imagine every dot on this map is a philosopher, the dots in the middle of the

28:27.480 --> 28:34.640
little cycles here are the supervisors, the PhD supervisors of the people on the edges

28:34.640 --> 28:36.280
of the ring.

28:36.280 --> 28:41.960
So truly influential people have big rings of followers around them.

28:41.960 --> 28:49.040
And every dot is a person who is an instance of the type philosopher.

28:49.040 --> 28:57.400
And this is the same information now expressed as a list rather than as a big graph.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.680
So this is the Leibniz lineage.

29:00.680 --> 29:05.040
Peter Hare was the chair of the philosophy department here at BUB for many years.

29:05.040 --> 29:11.080
And he is part of the Leibniz lineage in the sense that there is a line from Peter Hare

29:11.080 --> 29:15.520
through his supervisor all the way back to Leibniz.

29:15.520 --> 29:20.960
This is a bit of a cheat because Leibniz was not, in fact, the doctoral supervisor of Bernoulli.

29:20.960 --> 29:24.560
They didn't really have the supervisor system in 1663.

29:24.560 --> 29:32.160
But it's leaving aside that wrinkle, this is a picture of the doctor-father-student

29:32.160 --> 29:34.240
relation.

29:34.240 --> 29:41.280
This is the Menke lineage, which is less interesting, but it includes the immediate former chair

29:41.280 --> 29:46.120
of BUB, namely David Hirshinoff.

29:46.120 --> 29:50.880
And this is the Weiser lineage, which is also less interesting than the Leibniz lineage,

29:50.880 --> 29:56.520
which includes me and so forth.

29:56.520 --> 30:03.120
Now this is, all right, and now we have subtypes of philosopher.

30:03.120 --> 30:08.520
And you can see how complicated this graph is going to get once we organize it carefully

30:08.520 --> 30:09.520
and represent it.

30:09.520 --> 30:14.000
But still, it's not difficult to do this kind of work.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.760
There will be some overlaps, which will be difficult, but in general, we can get a lot

30:18.760 --> 30:26.560
of the easy parts done very quickly, and then we can create relations like I illustrated

30:26.560 --> 30:27.560
before.

30:27.560 --> 30:32.040
Now the big graph that I showed you and the tablets form something called the philosophy

30:32.040 --> 30:40.040
family tree, which describes itself as an academic genealogy of philosophers based on

30:40.040 --> 30:49.440
this link of Dr. Supervisor, and they have 140,000 entries, mostly from 1930.

30:49.440 --> 30:52.560
And so we can annotate this entire tree with information.

30:52.560 --> 30:57.160
So Plato worked on the third man argument.

30:57.160 --> 31:03.840
So we can, this is a picture so you can see a little bit more of the structure.

31:03.840 --> 31:09.520
And the boxes with the green and blue, these have turquoise, I guess.

31:09.520 --> 31:13.080
Those lines inside them are actually the names of the philosophers.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.560
If you continue to zoom in, you can actually read the names.

31:16.560 --> 31:20.520
So here you can read them.

31:20.520 --> 31:24.760
Now there are other people who have attempted to create such graphs of philosophy.

31:24.760 --> 31:27.800
This is a rather interesting one.

31:27.800 --> 31:36.800
So you can see that he divides epochs in something like the way that we get, if we shame back

31:36.800 --> 31:40.320
through the graph of the philosophy family tree.

31:40.320 --> 31:45.480
And this is what it looks like when you focus in on those epochs.

31:45.480 --> 31:51.000
And I was the editor of the moments to some time, which is founded by a gentleman called

31:51.000 --> 31:53.760
Paul Keras.

31:53.760 --> 32:00.040
And I've worked on these figures in the olden days when I used to do the history of philosophy.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.520
So Plato worked on the third man argument.

32:02.520 --> 32:07.120
Other people worked on the third man argument, so we can link them.

32:07.120 --> 32:13.560
And we can identify philosophical fields, for instance, feminist philosophy of science,

32:13.560 --> 32:18.720
by identifying within the tree all those philosophers who worked on feminist philosophy of science

32:18.720 --> 32:21.680
or are working on feminist philosophy of science.

32:21.680 --> 32:27.560
And similarly with philosophical groups, with epochs.

32:28.280 --> 32:33.160
And now we can use this tagged data.

32:33.160 --> 32:40.960
So we know many things about the people who are marked here as working within this epoch.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.320
We know what problems they worked on.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.960
We know what fields they belong to.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.400
We know what groups they belong to and so forth.

32:46.400 --> 32:51.840
We can use that tagged data in order to do semantically enhanced publishing.

32:51.840 --> 32:58.440
In other words, to create tagged versions of philosophical texts, articles or books or

32:58.440 --> 33:06.360
manuscripts along the same lines as we tagged biological texts using ontologies earlier

33:06.360 --> 33:09.040
on in this talk.

33:09.040 --> 33:20.080
All right, now, as I say, I have made some contributions to the humanities in my ontological

33:21.080 --> 33:22.080
role.

33:22.080 --> 33:28.120
And one of them was published in this volume called Thinking Through Digital Technology

33:28.120 --> 33:31.360
in the Humanities and the Arts.

33:31.360 --> 33:37.280
And the title of the paper you can see, I co-authored it with a colleague here in Buffalo called

33:37.280 --> 33:43.600
Verna Koistus, who is, well, I don't dance at all, and so he is a much better dancer

33:43.600 --> 33:44.600
than me.

33:44.600 --> 33:50.720
He's also the division chief of the Division of Biomedical Ontology in the UB Department

33:50.720 --> 33:52.360
of Biomedical Intimatics.

33:52.360 --> 34:00.400
This is the only academic unit in the world which has ontology in its title.

34:00.400 --> 34:07.000
And this is what he looks like when he's dancing.

34:08.000 --> 34:15.040
And the issue is how do you define a half cut in Irish, well, how do you even pronounce

34:15.040 --> 34:18.240
Sean Noth's dancing?

34:18.240 --> 34:24.280
That's what we had to do in order to create the ontology of dancing.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.280
That's the definition.

34:25.280 --> 34:31.000
And so it's not a short movement of one lower leg crossing the other leg with the foot pointing

34:31.000 --> 34:39.520
forward, because if I do that while standing in a bus queue, I'm not performing a half

34:39.520 --> 34:40.520
cut.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.600
I'm just moving my legs.

34:42.600 --> 34:49.520
So in order to be a half cut, it has to be part of a dance, which is a certain cultural

34:49.520 --> 34:51.360
phenomenon.

34:51.360 --> 34:56.600
It can't be an epileptic jerk or it can't be kicking a football.

34:56.600 --> 35:03.040
So the ontology of dance is more than an ontology of movement and it's more than an ontology

35:03.040 --> 35:06.080
of legs and feet and so forth.

35:06.080 --> 35:08.120
Although these have to be in the ontology.

35:08.120 --> 35:14.800
We take them from the foundational model of anatomy, which is the standard anatomy ontology.

35:14.800 --> 35:15.880
But we need more than that.

35:15.880 --> 35:22.520
We need also the culture of dance, the music which dance is associated with and so forth.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.480
Then we need to use the ontology to tag instance data.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.240
And why would we do that?

35:29.240 --> 35:34.840
Well, this is a question of history, discoverability.

35:34.840 --> 35:42.600
So there are many, many pieces of data relating to choreography, dress patterns, music and

35:42.600 --> 35:46.960
so on associated with dance in the course of history.

35:46.960 --> 35:52.360
And some of this is in the form of literature and some of it is in Spanish.

35:52.360 --> 35:53.440
Some of it is in English.

35:53.440 --> 35:55.680
Some of it is in Latin and so forth.

35:55.680 --> 36:06.320
And so in order to discover what the precursors of the quadri in, sorry, a 20th century Appalachian

36:06.320 --> 36:11.640
square dance, what the precursors are in the 17th century English quadri, we need to have

36:11.640 --> 36:18.560
a controlled vocabulary in which allows us to find the relevant sources.

36:18.560 --> 36:24.440
And this actually is required by the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural

36:24.440 --> 36:31.160
Heritage that we have to support the conditions when necessary for cultural reproduction.

36:31.160 --> 36:37.520
That means we have to be able to understand descriptions of dances in ancient texts in

36:37.520 --> 36:42.840
ways which modern users of language will be able to understand.

36:42.840 --> 36:46.960
And that's exactly the kind of thing which ontology is designed to support.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.080
Okay, so what do we do?

36:49.080 --> 36:55.280
We build the dance sable, which is like the genome, but it's a collection of all the

36:55.280 --> 37:01.040
data we have from any field pertaining to the history of dance, including journalism,

37:01.040 --> 37:07.680
fiction, history, biographies, and paintings, photographs, videos and so forth.

37:07.680 --> 37:12.440
All of those things can be collected and then they can be linked together by means of the

37:12.440 --> 37:18.160
ontology, and we can do reasoning across all the data by using the logical facilities

37:18.160 --> 37:20.280
which the ontology provides.

37:20.280 --> 37:25.400
We can discover things that we didn't know about by using the ontology, the facilities

37:25.400 --> 37:29.600
which the ontology provides, and so forth.

37:29.600 --> 37:35.400
Now that's 110 slides, which is not bad, but I think I'm going to stop there.

37:35.400 --> 37:39.080
So we also need a music ontology, dress ontology.

37:39.080 --> 37:43.160
We have the body part ontology, but we need a body part movement ontology, and then of

37:43.160 --> 37:47.400
course the dance ontology will be related to the emotion ontology for obvious reasons.

37:47.400 --> 37:48.400
But now I really will stop.
