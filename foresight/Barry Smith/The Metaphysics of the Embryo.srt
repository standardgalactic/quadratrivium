1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
And I'm going to be responding to King Ma's presentation.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,880
And we can summarize Elsa Lyne's view as follows.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,000
There is something like a placenta uterine cord

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,760
foster, a myriological hole, which

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,160
grows directly out of the uterine wall,

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,320
just as a tail grows out of the cat.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,200
And I'm quoting the paper, Pregnant Mariology.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,840
Therefore, it follows that the foster,

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,400
post-implantation, and prior to birth

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,080
is a part of the mother.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,760
She gives various reasons, which, again, I

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,840
will explain in due course.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,160
Now, the alternative to this part-to-end view

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,360
that she discusses, which is an alternative which I embrace

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,760
and which we defended in the 16 days paper,

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,720
is called the fetal container view, which

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,080
says that the fetus is inside the mother,

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,440
but not a part of the mother.

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,560
And through her papers, and also at various points

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,440
during her presentation today, points

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,320
where she tended to raise her voice

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,320
and become very passionate.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,880
This fetal container view is, she says,

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,400
a view no one has ever argued for.

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,840
And she thinks this is a mark against it.

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,920
All right, now the chief witness is an octopus, the argonaut.

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,800
And what Kingma refers to as its detachable penis.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,680
But actually, if you look at the literature on the argonaut,

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,320
it's called a detachable modified arm.

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,880
And Kingma, in her way, wanted to see this

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,640
as being an archetypical male thing

32
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,920
to worry about detached penises.

33
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,960
But we don't actually worry very much about losing arms.

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,320
A hectotillus, it says, is one of the arms of male cephalopods

35
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,480
that is specialized to store and transfer sperm to the female.

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,600
And now comes the polite part.

37
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,520
Depending on the species, the male

38
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,600
may use it merely as a conduit to the female,

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,920
or he may wrench it off and present it to the female.

40
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,880
If you're an octopus, you can do these things.

41
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,800
The idea is that we can learn something about metaphysics

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,040
from the case of the argonaut, namely that there

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,800
can be detachable organs.

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,840
And the idea would be then that the foster

45
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,080
is a detachable organ.

46
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,760
So it would be like a kidney which

47
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,480
lives the life of its own once it's

48
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,680
been detached from its host.

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,720
Kingma holds the view that there are some parts, not organs,

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,360
but some parts of the organism, an organism like ourselves,

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,400
which do not persist through separation,

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,720
such as the heart or the brain, and other parts which

53
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,600
do persist through separation.

54
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:13,600
And these would include, on her view anyway, the foster,

55
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,120
the fetus embryo baby inside the mother.

56
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,760
I agree that there are some parts which can survive.

57
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,440
Many molecules survive.

58
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,520
In fact, all molecules, I guess, survive in one way or another

59
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,160
that we lose in the course of our lives.

60
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,360
So it's certainly true that there are parts.

61
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,960
The question is whether there are organs,

62
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,000
and the question is whether the foster is

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,720
to be regarded under this heading, which can survive

64
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,040
and become what embryos do.

65
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,520
Namely, mature adults, if they're lucky.

66
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,000
When I read Kingma's, sorry, Elsa Lyne's writings

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,600
on these matters, she repeatedly cites the paper 16 days.

68
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,280
She only ever cites one sentence, which is a sentence

69
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,760
about a tub of yogurt.

70
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,760
Now, the 16 days fetal container view

71
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,560
is also called the tenant niche view.

72
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,440
We regard the foster as a tenant in the niche which is created

73
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,560
by the mother through the uterus.

74
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,160
We give us some examples of the niche tenant relation,

75
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,000
one of which is the relation between a tub of yogurt

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,040
and the inside of your refrigerator.

77
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,920
She suggests that we'd never heard of the umbilical cord

78
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,240
in the placenta when we wrote the paper.

79
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,600
Of course, we'd heard about the fact

80
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,800
that the umbilical cord is connected to the placenta

81
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,640
at one side and is connected to the baby on the other side.

82
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,240
And she says that this means that the foster mother relation

83
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,320
or the foster uterus relation cannot be a niche tenant relation

84
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,760
because the baby shares an external boundary

85
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,800
with the umbilical cord.

86
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,240
She also thinks that given that the placenta has a maternal part

87
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,680
and a fetal part, there must be an overlap

88
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,160
or there must be parts in common between the baby and the fetus.

89
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,600
But that's not true, of course, because the fetal part of the placenta

90
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,360
and the maternal part of the placenta

91
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,120
are two different layers within one of the same organ.

92
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,640
They are separated from each other also

93
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,880
by some liquid or fluid filled cavity

94
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,600
as we will see ad nauseam in the next few minutes.

95
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,280
So it's really only number two, which is a problem,

96
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,600
but it's not a problem if you read the paper.

97
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,000
Now, there are two cases that we need to distinguish.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,440
One is the future baby view,

99
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,840
where we're considering whether the future baby

100
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,280
could be the tenant inside the niche, which is the uterus.

101
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,680
The other is the placenta uterine cord foster view.

102
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,040
So this is the future baby view.

103
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,000
And this is what we said in 16 days.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,240
So the issue, remember, is whether they share an external boundary.

105
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,960
Each substance possesses its own complete connected external boundary

106
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,080
analogous to the service of a sphere or torus.

107
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,880
We are, of course, toruses because of the chest if trapped.

108
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,440
Each substance possesses its own complete connected external boundary,

109
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,040
which divides its interior from its exterior

110
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,480
and at the same time separates it, especially from other substances.

111
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,000
The future baby has its own external boundary.

112
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,960
The mother has her own external boundary.

113
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,800
And on this view, the interior boundary of the uterus

114
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,880
or the amniotic cavity, we'll come back to that later,

115
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,280
is the relevant external boundary,

116
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,360
which is not shared by the fetus.

117
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,080
It's separated by liquid from the fetus.

118
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,320
So because the external boundary very often

119
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,880
will have pores and other gaps and still be an external boundary.

120
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,720
The external boundary is established by a physical covering or membrane

121
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,120
which extends continuously across all or almost all of its surface.

122
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,960
Almost all because typically there are small apertures,

123
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,720
pores, nostrils, your mouth, for instance.

124
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,560
The fact that you have a mouth which has a hole in it

125
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,320
doesn't mean that there is, you don't have an external boundary.

126
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,560
The fact that there are some organisms

127
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,440
which are connected to other entities,

128
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,600
for instance, somebody walking in space is connected to the spaceship,

129
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,200
or somebody inside a spaceship is connected by the spaceship itself

130
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,440
by various tubes and connectors,

131
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,960
doesn't mean that the spaceship and the astronaut

132
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,760
have suddenly become biologically one thing

133
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:02,560
so that the astronaut would be a part of this unified spaceship astronaut hole.

134
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,200
Nor when somebody is in an ICU,

135
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,760
which has been sealed off from the rest of the environment for immunological reasons,

136
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,560
and is connected by breathing tubes,

137
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,400
does it mean that the patient in the ICU has somehow become part of the ICU

138
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,120
rather than, as we can all see,

139
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,600
standing, or in this case lying, in a niche-tenant relationship

140
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,840
to the niche which is created by the ICU

141
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:37,160
and to the regulation of the person's oxygen needs and so forth,

142
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,080
which the ICU provides in virtue of the various connectors and tubes

143
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,840
which are connecting to the patient.

144
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:51,800
Now, it's very easy, well, it's relatively easy to disconnect those tubes.

145
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,200
It's relatively easy to disconnect the tubes even of the astronaut

146
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,280
providing he's careful when, or she is careful when climbing back into the spaceship.

147
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:07,320
Similarly, it's made easy, not by biology in this case, but by technology.

148
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,200
It's very easy to separate to stamps,

149
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,760
because stamps have perforations.

150
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,200
Now, there are some bodily connections which are similarly easily separated.

151
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,760
For instance, blisters.

152
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:32,560
The idea that Alphaline has to defend is that when the foster, on one view,

153
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,680
or the foster plus umbilical cord plus placenta on the other view,

154
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,240
leaves the mother, then a substantial change occurs.

155
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,800
Now, in the 16 days paper, we explain at great length what a substantial change is.

156
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Substantial change is not moving location.

157
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,200
It's not changing the things that you're attached to.

158
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,360
It's not being viewed by people in a different way.

159
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,720
So on one day they view you as such and such,

160
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,000
on another day they view you as something else.

161
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,400
It's something which is catastrophic.

162
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,880
Two drops of water merge and flow into one.

163
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,040
An amoeba splits.

164
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,080
A block of marble is split and becomes two.

165
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,400
Or a pair of conjoined twins is separated.

166
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,920
These are big changes.

167
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,160
Moving out of the niche, in other words, becoming born, is not a big change.

168
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,040
It's just moving from one place to another.

169
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,320
So it's like the tenant leaving her apartment or the passenger leaving her car.

170
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,680
On the future baby view, it's not a case of substantial change.

171
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,600
But on the corionic content growing directly out of the uterine world,

172
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,240
just as the tail grows out of the cat, it does look catastrophic.

173
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,800
It does look as if it could be a case like a block of marble splitting into two.

174
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,080
There's a lot of blood.

175
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,440
It's painful.

176
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,760
And so Elsa-Lyne argues that we are dealing here with a real boundary

177
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:14,360
and that breaking of the breaking of which we bring about a substantial change.

178
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,720
And so she uses the argument that because of the blood,

179
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,720
it's more like separating the tail from a cat, which is not a non-trivial break.

180
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,960
It's not like tearing two stamps down the perforation.

181
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,520
It's something much more substantial than that.

182
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,560
In the normal case, in fact, the placenta does detach easily.

183
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,320
There's a lot of blood, but then there's a lot of blood in menstruation, too.

184
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,200
If there is a problem in detaching the placenta,

185
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,480
and thereby also in detaching the umbilical cord from the mother,

186
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,440
that's because there is something abnormal.

187
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,160
It's because something's gone wrong.

188
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,760
It's a mark of something going wrong that the placenta doesn't detach easily.

189
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,120
Normally, it detaches easily with a lot of blood.

190
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,760
All right, so this is how it looks.

191
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:11,280
There is the future vein connected to the placenta via the umbilical cord,

192
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,800
which is connected in terms of the placenta.

193
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,320
There is a fetal part of the placenta.

194
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,440
There's a maternal part of the placenta.

195
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,160
And there is a perforation kind of boundary here, not a fiat boundary,

196
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,240
which would imply no physical discontinuity,

197
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,320
but a bona fide boundary because the lining of the uterus

198
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,400
is a physical discontinuity as between the placenta and the mother.

199
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,200
My idea with the niche-tenant relation or the tenant-niche relation

200
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:48,520
is captured rather conveniently in a series of papers and articles

201
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,160
about the microbiome.

202
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,920
So 100 trillion good bacteria call the human body home.

203
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,120
They are all standing to the human body in the tenant-niche relation.

204
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,960
They're all tenants.

205
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,720
Some of them are friendly tenants.

206
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,880
Some of them are pathogen, and we want to get rid of them.

207
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,320
The baby is like that.

208
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,600
So we need to understand what it is to be in your home.

209
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,040
And that's a very complicated relation.

210
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,520
One of the argument strategies which Elsa Lyne uses

211
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,720
is to suggest that by viewing the relationship between the baby

212
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,240
and the mother as a niche-tenant relation,

213
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,800
we are making it sound much too simple.

214
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,480
We're neglecting all the processes of regulation,

215
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,000
many of which are catered for by the placenta,

216
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,760
which, as she quite rightly points out,

217
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,640
is an amazingly sophisticated organ.

218
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,680
All those processes of regulation are in operation

219
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,360
precisely on the tenant-niche view,

220
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,960
just as they're in operation in your apartment,

221
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,720
regulating the temperature of the air,

222
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,600
regulating the availability of water and electricity

223
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,160
and internet connections, and so forth.

224
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,120
So a home, whether it be the home of the baby inside the mother

225
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,960
or whether it be the home of the tenant inside its apartment,

226
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,760
is a regulated environment with all kinds of functional connections

227
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,800
to the outside world through all kinds of engineered equipment.

228
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,600
And so these are some examples of engineered equipment.

229
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,920
They all have functions, and they're all part of the home.

230
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,440
They're part of the home because they are functionally connected

231
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,280
to the workings of the home.

232
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,120
And the workings of the home may include also security.

233
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:36,000
So the reason why the amnion, the structure which houses

234
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,360
the tenant we call the baby, is so complicated

235
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,360
is because it's serving the purpose of keeping the baby safe.

236
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,200
That's why there are so many layers.

237
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,240
I'm back to the ICU again.

238
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,920
So your body houses 10 times more bacteria than cells.

239
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,000
Your body is home.

240
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,160
So these are all indications everywhere

241
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,200
in the biological literature of the niche tenant

242
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,760
relation as applied to bodies and things like bacteria.

243
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,480
And you find it also in the literature on gynecology

244
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,600
all over the place.

245
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,360
Else the line just didn't see it.

246
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,280
Trillions upon trillions of tiny passengers, bacteria,

247
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,320
when the baby gets out of the womb,

248
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,920
it's like a passenger getting out of the car.

249
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,800
It's not a substantial change.

250
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:26,200
It's a painful operation, but it's not a substantial change.

251
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,240
So what makes a part?

252
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,920
First of all, we're interested in parts

253
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,400
on the inside of the organism, like the tub of yogurt

254
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:34,880
in the roof.

255
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,080
Being connected is not good enough.

256
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,320
You could have the refrigerator magnets which

257
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,840
are connected to your fridge, but that wouldn't make them parts

258
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,520
of the fridge.

259
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
In fact, you can be a part of the fridge

260
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,960
without being connected.

261
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,400
There can be movable parts of the fridge.

262
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,240
What makes a part most importantly is having a function.

263
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,360
And Elsa Lyne sort of understood that in her way a bit.

264
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,720
She didn't provide a definition of function.

265
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,640
And we provided a definition of function

266
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,920
which you can look at here.

267
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,640
And it would be interesting if people

268
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,320
have counter examples of entities with functions which

269
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,160
do not satisfy this definition.

270
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,600
Basically, what it says is that an object Y has a function

271
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,880
means it has a disposition in virtue of the way

272
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
it's built physically.

273
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,880
And that entity came into existence

274
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,680
through historical processes which

275
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,000
selected for entities capable of realizing that disposition.

276
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And there are two ways that can happen.

277
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,880
One is intentional design for artifacts

278
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,160
like refrigerators and motor cars.

279
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,320
And the other is evolutionary selection

280
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,200
for biological entities.

281
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,880
I don't know of any other way in which functional, sorry,

282
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,600
in which entities with functions come into existence.

283
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,520
So two of that kinds of things have functions, artifacts,

284
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,760
and the component parts of artifacts,

285
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,600
and parts of organisms.

286
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,760
I do not believe that organisms have functions

287
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,760
unless you believe in slavery or unless you

288
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,760
follow Richard Dawkins and thinks that we are just

289
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,120
the functional artifacts created by genes in order

290
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,960
to propagate themselves through the universe.

291
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,080
I don't accept them, either of those.

292
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,480
So I can't think of any other reasons why organisms

293
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,280
could be functions.

294
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,840
Any organisms, whether bacteria or human beings.

295
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,520
It could be that we manufacture bacteria

296
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,680
and that we create artifact, and then they

297
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,480
would have functions because we designed them

298
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,840
for a certain purpose, to perform a certain function.

299
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,400
But I can't think of any other ways

300
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,800
in which biological entities can have functions other

301
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,080
than being parts of organisms.

302
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,120
Your heart has a function.

303
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,160
Your kidney has a function.

304
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,520
Your baby doesn't have a function because it's an organism.

305
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,480
Therefore, your baby is not part of an organism

306
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,680
because it doesn't satisfy that has a function relation.

307
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,560
Now, in fact, what makes a part in the biological case

308
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,040
is much more complicated.

309
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,400
And that we could divide it into two questions, namely,

310
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,440
the part question for small molecules.

311
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,280
So banana molecules, when you've half digested a banana.

312
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,400
Are the banana molecules parts of you or not?

313
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,040
That's a very difficult kind of question.

314
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,600
There are many questions like that which are difficult.

315
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,800
Fortunately, we're interested in parthood

316
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,840
for large granularity entities like fetuses,

317
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,000
even very small fetuses, are much larger than small molecules.

318
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,160
And so we can make progress here.

319
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,960
In the biological case,

320
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,960
being on the inside is clearly not enough again.

321
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,040
So a bullet inside your body is not part of your body.

322
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,200
Being connected is not so relevant.

323
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,480
So all the parts of your organism are indeed connected

324
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,760
to the other parts except for blood cells.

325
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,320
Blood cells are the only freely moving parts of your body.

326
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,840
They're parts.

327
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,760
And all biologists accepts the blood cells

328
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,280
as parts of your body.

329
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,480
So what makes a part?

330
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,480
Well, it can't be having a function either

331
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,000
because prostheses have functions,

332
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,280
but prostheses are not parts.

333
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,000
Hair satisfies the criterion of having a function

334
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,440
whose realization is necessary

335
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,120
for the host's continued existence,

336
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,520
or at least did originally satisfy that function

337
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,040
before we had home heating and air conditioning and so forth.

338
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,520
Microbiota are not parts.

339
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,560
The embryo is not a part if the embryo is an organism.

340
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,160
So could the embryo be something like an organ of the mother

341
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,720
so that it could satisfy this criterion?

342
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,880
Because an organ has a function.

343
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,520
In fact, that's part of the definition of what an organ is.

344
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,320
For Elsa Lyne to get her way,

345
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,360
we have to find a way of recognizing

346
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,760
that the embryo has a function

347
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,360
and so that it can be an organ of the mother.

348
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,520
It has to be a function which contributes

349
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,640
to the mother's continued existence or something like that.

350
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,360
In her talk today, Elsa Lyne told us

351
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,240
what the function of the foster is.

352
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,800
And I think this is the weakest point in her entire book.

353
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,200
It says the function of the foster

354
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,240
is to perform the reproductive function of the crevita.

355
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,400
Now, I don't think this makes sense.

356
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,920
I don't think it makes sense to say

357
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,840
that the function of one entity

358
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,040
is to perform the function of another entity.

359
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,200
The whole point of having a function

360
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,800
is that you have to perform it.

361
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,240
All of these things are things which have functions.

362
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Of their own.

363
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,640
So what she said is a bit like saying,

364
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,000
the function of this biscuit is to enable

365
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,720
the performance of the cooking function of my stove

366
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,160
or of my chef.

367
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,520
Or the function of this gash is to enable the performance

368
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,720
of the slashing function of my scimitar.

369
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,720
Or the function of this engine air filter

370
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,760
is to enable the performance

371
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,840
of the engineering function of the automobile engineer.

372
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,960
It just doesn't make sense.

373
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,680
But there is a fourth criterion

374
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,920
because we saw processes have functions

375
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,600
which contribute to the realization

376
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,920
of the goals of the host,

377
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,880
but they are not parts of the host.

378
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,480
In order to be a part in the biological sense,

379
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,480
the entity in question has to be generated

380
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,880
by the coordinated expression of the organism's own genes.

381
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,560
And that's a standard thesis from standard anatomy.

382
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,040
That's how they work out

383
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,960
what the anatomical parts of the organism are.

384
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,880
I'll give you cloned embryos elsewhere.

385
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,040
But all other embryos are on this criterion,

386
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,880
not parts of the mother

387
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,920
because they are not expressions

388
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,720
of the mother's own genes.

389
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
All right, so the reason why no one ever argued

390
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,200
for the fetal container view

391
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,400
is the same as the reason why no one ever argued

392
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,600
for the view that two plus two equals four.

393
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,520
It's obvious.

394
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,000
And the reason why it's obvious to all biologists

395
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,520
is because all biologists know what mammals are.

396
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,960
Amniota, which comes from the Greek for lamb.

397
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,960
And it means an organism that lays its eggs on land

398
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,240
or retains the fertilized egg within the mother.

399
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,720
So the key to understanding where else the line went wrong

400
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,920
is the egg.

401
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,480
All amniota are characterized by having an egg

402
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,720
which is equipped with an amnios or membrane.

403
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,760
And the membrane is going to be a multi-layered membrane

404
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,080
which enables certain kinds of exchange

405
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,760
between the outside and the inside, protects the baby.

406
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,840
And in mammals such as humans,

407
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,120
these membranes include the amniotic sac

408
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,280
that surrounds the fetus.

409
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,480
So the amniotic sac is the niche

410
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,280
and the fetus is the tenant.

411
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,540
The chicken is the tenant, the egg,

412
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,860
the interior of the egg is the niche.

413
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,060
So this is where we are.

414
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,060
We are amniota, these are the chordates.

415
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,260
There are many, many other chordates,

416
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,420
but we are here in the amniotic part of the chordates.

417
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,820
And amniota include mammals,

418
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,620
but they include all kinds of other stuff,

419
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,020
including turtles and crocodiles and all birds.

420
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,220
They lay eggs, remember, just like we do.

421
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,300
So this is the anatomy of an amniotic egg.

422
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:23,340
There are 15 parts and this is a crocodile egg.

423
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,580
I didn't count them up,

424
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,900
but the yolk sac and the yolk are pretty obvious

425
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,460
and they're going to be present in every egg.

426
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,020
And remember that the chicken egg is covered in many pores

427
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,620
which enable the chicken to breathe.

428
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,820
Still has an external boundary.

429
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,460
In amniotes that lay eggs,

430
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,700
the shell of the egg provides protection

431
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,380
while being permeable to allow oxygen exchange in mammals.

432
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,100
Membranes that are homologous,

433
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,740
that means they have a common evolutionary ancestor

434
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,580
to the extra embryonic membranes in eggs

435
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,620
are present in the placenta.

436
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,220
So that's humans, that's reptiles and birds.

437
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,140
It's the same thing.

438
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,500
They're both a niche with a tenant.

439
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,500
One's inside the mother, one's outside the mother, laid.

440
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,900
The placenta is a fantastic organ.

441
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,500
It allows exchange of matter.

442
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,900
So that's the placenta and these are all amniota

443
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,900
and I rest my case.

444
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,100
Be careful.
