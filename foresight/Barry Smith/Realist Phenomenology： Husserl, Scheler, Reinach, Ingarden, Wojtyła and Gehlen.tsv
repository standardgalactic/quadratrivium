0	12240	I'm talking today about phenomenology. Now, today in my professional life, I spend a lot
12240	19040	of time doing formal ontology, which is very closely related to a non-phenomenological kind
19040	25200	of philosophy called the analytic philosophy, logical philosophy. For a long time in my life,
25200	30640	I work on phenomenology. And this is what this is about. And so it has a kind of,
31920	38720	I wouldn't say oldy-worldy flavor, although it does go back 50 years. But it does deal with some
38720	46240	of the reasons why my life progressed phenomenologically as it did. So it started with the very first
46240	50880	philosophy book that I had in my hands in school, which was Wittgenstein's Traptators.
51600	57520	I was about to go to university to study mathematics. Wittgenstein's Traptators convinced
57520	63040	me that I should study mathematics and philosophy. And I did this in Oxford for three years. So
64080	68960	I was at Jesus College, which is somewhere at the back there. I was there for three years as an
68960	74960	undergraduate. And the one person who really influenced me was Michael Dumit, who is a specialist
74960	82480	on Frege and on a view of analytic philosophy, as rooted not just in Frege's ideas, but in
82480	89040	the idea that studying language could be the key tool to unlock philosophical problems.
89040	97280	And during my stay in Oxford, I had dreams of writing a PhD. My goal was to write a PhD on
98320	104000	the aesthetics of mathematics. So the idea would be that mathematical theorems
104000	109600	or chess games or musical works can have aesthetic properties. I did end up writing
109600	117040	a PhD thesis, but it was about something quite different. And my change came about by accident.
117040	123120	Roman Ingaarden was the key and this book changed my plans. All right, then I moved to the University
123120	128320	of Manchester, which is where I lived, and which was the only place in England at that time where
128400	134480	you could study phenomenology. I was a student working, well, on my thesis, which is called
135600	141600	I used a typewriter. If I made any mistakes, I had to write out top copy and the carbon copy.
142320	148960	It's 600 and something pages long. I didn't know what hellish waste of time I was going through
148960	156000	because we didn't have computers in those days. And it's about Hossel, Frege, Dumit and Mino.
156640	162560	But it's about ontology in the classical philosophical sense. It's about how these people
162560	171040	study beings, entities formally. And during that time, I met two philosophers, philosophy students
171920	177920	who were also doing a PhD in Manchester at the same time. Peter Simons became quite famous
178560	185840	in various universities. He finished in Trinity College, Dublin. And Kevin finished and hasn't
186240	192800	quite finished yet in the University of Geneva. So all right, this is Manchester. After my PhD,
192800	199280	I moved to a postdoc in another Northern English University. And then I moved back to Manchester
199280	206960	as a faculty member. I inherited the position of my PhD supervisor who retired. So I was responsible
206960	212960	for phenomenology in the philosophy department in Manchester, which was very much dominated
212960	219520	by what we might call American. Americans are of two types. On the one hand, there are Americans
220080	224320	who do American philosophy. And then on the other hand, there are English people who do
224320	231840	American philosophy. I was the only person doing philosophy in a European sense. So Peter and
231840	236400	Kevin and I published a lot together. We worked a lot together. We organized many meetings together
236400	242320	and we changed the world. This was one of the papers which was quite successful and still
242320	250160	successful that there's a whole industry of truth making, which we more or less initiated in 1984.
250160	257280	And on my door in the philosophy department in Manchester, I had this sign that to indicate that
257280	261680	you were now going into the world of European philosophy. This comes from the Berlin Wall.
261680	267280	I guess you all know what the Berlin Wall is. Checkpoints, Darley and all that. The centre
267360	273040	of all of this work with Peter and Kevin was not in Garden, but in Garden's teacher,
273040	280880	Husser, who was the founder of phenomenology and who was born in Austria, Hungary. And a lot of the
280880	290640	work I did subsequently between 1990 and 2000 or 1918, 2000, was it about Austro-Hungarian philosophy,
291360	297120	including Husser. Normally counted as a German philosophy because he spent his mature life in
297120	302880	Germany, but he was born in Austria-Hungary and like many of the other people I'm going to talk
302880	307920	about, even the Poles I'm going to talk about, they were born in Austria too and they were certainly
307920	315920	not part of Poland because Poland didn't exist. All right, so formal ontology. The term comes from
315920	321600	Husser's logical investigations and both Peter and Kevin and I thought that Husser's logical
321600	328080	investigations and specifically the logical investigation number three on the theory of
328080	333040	holes and parts was the key to doing good philosophy. So we thought that many of the
333600	341040	targets of analytic philosophy were important to work on, but the proper method was to be found
341040	349040	in Husser. So this is the first formal theory of myriology, theory of parts and parts. And more
349040	355200	generally, it presents something called formal ontology, which is the theory of ontological
355200	362160	structures, which are formal in the sense that they are domain neutral, not material in the
362160	369200	sense of being related to matter, but material in the sense of being domain, non-neutral, domain
369200	378560	specific. And relations like part whole, instance of, and so forth, are formal relations. All right,
378560	384000	so these are the main parts of Husser's formal ontology. He was very keen on the idea of a theory
384000	392400	of dependence relations and theories of boundaries and continuities, topology, and then theories of
392400	398000	instantiation of species and lowest specific differences and so forth. So this is pretty
398000	404480	old fashioned in the sense that most of it is found in some form in Aristotle. But Husser
405840	411520	saw, and Husser was originally a mathematician, saw that you could treat these kinds of issues
412080	419520	in a formal way in the sense of that mathematics also is formed. So formal logic, formal ontology,
420080	425360	and formal axiology, which Husser also dealt with, are all very much related to mathematics.
428320	438880	30 years later, probably in Italy, but that's neither here nor there, I created something
438880	445600	called basic formal ontology. And this has become very important. This is what I work on
445600	452240	all the time now. And this includes all of the things that Husser thought were important parts
452240	460960	of formal ontology, together with a much more specific treatment of spacetime of processes
460960	465920	and of what we call realizable entities, which means dispositions, powers, functions, roles,
465920	471680	and so forth. So basic formal ontology is very much rooted in Husser's logical investigations,
472320	478080	and it adds these particular ingredients. The idea is to create a top level ontology,
478080	486000	which will not merely be domain neutral, but will be domain all encompassing. In other words,
486000	496160	every formal ontological need of any ontology will be met by BFO. I don't claim that is the case yet,
496160	504080	but it will be the case maybe in 50 years. So it's hard work. All right, so we have formal ontology,
504080	509120	which deals with the interconnections of things, and we have formal logic, which deals with the
509120	514800	interconnections of truths. And that too corresponds broadly with Husser's account of the relation.
514800	521760	He was not always clear when he was using the word formal to distinguish formal ontology and
521760	531200	formal logic. But this corresponds to the view, the general view, who is presenting in the logical
531200	538720	investigations. And so these are ontological structures. So that's John and that's Mary,
538720	543200	and they are independent entities. So they're not dependent on anything else,
543200	549280	in the sense of dependent, which Husser was talking about. But they are in love with each other.
549280	558560	And so there is a relational quality of love, which is symmetric, which is one-sidedly dependent
558640	568400	on John and one-sidedly dependent on Mary. And we represent that in this way. So dependent entities
568400	574080	have dotted lines and independent entities have solid lines and relations that are captured
574720	582000	representationally by using single lines connecting boxes. And here we see two kinds of relations.
582000	590000	Dependence relations are what we can think of as thin relations, and love and hate and
591040	599280	marriage and magnetic attraction are thick relations. They have empirical properties of
599280	606000	various sorts. And there is a third kind of relation, which are comparative, such as being
606000	613360	taller than. But in any case, there's more than one kind of relation. In predicate logic, of course,
613360	620080	people don't realize that. And so one of the activities that we engaged in during this period
620080	624640	was attacking analytic philosophers because they thought that predicate logic gave you a key
625600	633280	to creating a mirror of the universe. And they got it wrong. Husser and Aristotle came closer
633280	640560	to getting it wrong. All right, so that's a relation. And then we can have also two-sided
640560	646000	mutual dependence. And well, we'll give some examples of this later on. But you can see how
646000	651840	these kinds of diagrams can grow to deal with more complicated entities. Maybe this is the
651840	662320	marriage bond between John and Mary. And then Mary has a claim on John and John has an obligation
662320	667680	to marry that kind of thing. Then the claim and the obligation will be mutually dependent.
667680	673520	We'll come back to these things later on. And then we can illustrate part-whole relations. So love
673520	680320	may include going on holiday. You go on holiday together. And that would be a part of the general
680320	684560	relation of love in this particular case, although that example is not a very good one.
685200	694720	All right. So now we get to the structure of the universe. So Husser's idea is that there are
694720	701920	relations which we find in the universe, which are essential relations. Now, again, Aristotle saw
701920	709600	this story. This is not really anything new. But dependence relations are essential relations
709600	716320	in this sense. And there are laws of essence which capture these necessary relations. And
716320	725600	dependence between the love of John for Mary and John is an essential relation. A love cannot exist
725600	734320	without a lover, a subject. That's an essential relation called necessitation. If love exists,
734320	740960	then there is some lover, not necessarily to, but in the happy instances, then it will go in both
740960	750800	worlds. To say that love is compatible with kindness is to express an essential relation. To say that
750800	757440	love is incompatible with plotting to murder is another example, maybe one of these essential
757440	763840	relations. And similar, that means that love excludes plotting to murder. So we have here some,
763840	769920	again, not very good examples of laws of essence. And this is going to play an important role in
769920	777040	the whole of phenomenology. And Kit Van, who is the world's greatest living metaphysician.
777760	788240	All right. So all of this is being represented, practiced, formulated in German. And so we have
788240	793600	a very important word, Vesens zusammen, which means something like essential structure or
793600	799520	essential configuration. And Vesens Gazette, which means essential law, that we are interested in
799520	807200	the Vesens zusammen, Hinger, the essential structures. And we don't call them essential
807200	813200	structures. When I say we know, I need your slant paper myself, we're working on mathematics and
813200	820240	physics ontology. There are essential structures in those domains. But we, the word, if the phrase
820240	826400	essential structure doesn't work quite so well, as reasons to them, particularly if you're German.
827360	832960	All right. Now, so we have formal ontological relations like dependence. And we also have
832960	840800	formal ontological categories, which correspond to material ontological categories or domain
840800	848640	specific categories such as rabbit or mammal or cell. But they're all formal. And these are the
848640	855440	main examples mentioned by Husser, object state affairs and so on. And you can put these together
855520	861520	in law governed ways. For instance, you can create object aggregates, or you can create
861520	866480	states of affairs by taking an object in the property. You say the property
867760	871600	of this object or this object has this property, that is a state of affairs.
874720	882480	So now formal ontology is like formal logic. Once we've grasped a formal structure in one
882480	888480	instance, we have grasped it for every instance. That's why logic is so powerful. That's why
888480	894320	mathematics is so powerful. Formal ontology is similarly powerful. That's why BFO is so powerful.
895280	904400	And we've, we ain't seen nothing yet. All right, now compare it as the epic, and this is a phrase from
905920	910560	Husser, if the relevant formal ontology has been worked out, then all deductive theoretical work
910560	914960	in the building up of all actual theories in the same form has been done.
916880	927440	So I've said that, and we've said that, and we've said that. And now we can, we come to definitions.
927440	934080	Now Husser, Aristotle had an idea of definitions. And we have to remember that all sciences,
934880	941360	including the science of definitions are perfect to the extent that Aristotle treated
941360	948800	of them. So here Bonaventure is just explicating what Aristotle would have said. If we want a
948800	958320	definition, we want to explicate the meanings of terms. And we succeed when the intellect can use
958400	965360	the definition to grasp, comprehend what a thing is. In other words, what type of thing a thing is.
966320	972960	But definitions are constructed by use, using more universal terms. So a cat is an object,
972960	980560	which is a mammal, which is, I don't, which meow, I don't know. A human is a, a substance,
980560	986800	which is an animal and disruption. We always go to a higher level to form, make a definition.
986800	994880	This was the rule for making definitions in terms of the, including genus, plus the specific
994880	1002160	difference, which makes the term you're defining refer to those things which fall under the term,
1002160	1008240	the species term rather than the genus term. So what makes a human different from an animal is
1008240	1012640	that the human has a specific difference in being rationed, according to Aristotle,
1012640	1020000	in some places, in other places he has a different stroke. So, but definitions are
1020000	1025520	constructed by use, using more universal terms. And these are defined by still more universal
1025520	1032160	terms until we come to the highest and most universal. And we can't define that because
1032160	1038560	we're already at the top. And this is where, this is where the top was for Aristotle. And this is
1038640	1046880	where the top and basic formal ontology is, is, is named after this passage in the third logic
1046880	1053120	of investigation where he'll sell was the first person ever to use the phrase formal ontology.
1053120	1061840	So this is where the top ends really. This is, this is Aristotle plus some more things. This is
1062800	1071200	one quarter of BFO minus all the relations. All right, and this is the ISO standard. Aristotle
1071200	1077440	didn't get to the point where he had an ISO standard. All right, these are now some of the
1077440	1083680	examples of the some 400 or so domain ontologies, which are defined into domain specific ontologies
1083680	1089760	defined in the Saint Blaine adventure Aristotelian way on the basis of BFO.
1091040	1097520	And the mental functioning ontology takes BFO and then adds more terms in roughly this kind of way.
1098160	1104560	The emotion ontology takes the mental functioning ontology and adds yet more terms to create an
1104560	1112320	ontology of the different aspects of emotions, not kinds, but aspects, because every emotion
1112320	1117760	involves a physiological response, every emotion involves an emotional action tendency and so
1118720	1125600	and these are some examples of these aspects of emotions in the emotional ontology. So
1126320	1134960	muscles becoming tense or feeling weak and sweating. So all right, now, so we've had this
1135680	1142720	all of this was happening in Germany, to some degree in Austria, as we will see later,
1143360	1151120	some degree even in Poland during the 1900s to 1930, but already much earlier parallel
1151840	1156480	things were going on in Austria. And I wrote a book about some of these things
1157440	1165840	in the realm of economics. And there are quite close relations between Austrian philosophy on the
1165840	1171760	one hand, and Austrian economics, partly because some of them lived in the same building or had
1171760	1177840	cousins who were married to each other. All right, no, the cousins were not married. All right.
1179040	1183200	So Karl Manger was the founder of a school called the Austrian School of Economics,
1183200	1188880	which still exists today. There are still whole sections of economics departments,
1188880	1194960	for instance, in New York University, which are devoted to this school. It's meant to be a counter
1194960	1202480	to the Keynesian classical or neoclassical schools of economics. And the original versions of
1202480	1208960	Austrian economics were about laws of essence or reasons, because that's in the realm of economics.
1209760	1217680	And this is an example. A good exists only if simultaneously we have a need, a causal connection
1217680	1222800	to the satisfaction of this need, a knowledge of this causal connection, and a command over the
1222800	1230160	theme sufficient to direct it to satisfy the need. And Manger wrote whole books based upon this kind
1230160	1237040	of essential analysis, which is an analysis of part whole relations as well as dependence
1237040	1245200	relations. So it's very much in the spirit of Hossel. So the goal of research in economics can
1245200	1249920	only be the determination of the general essence and the general connection of economic phenomena.
1249920	1254000	And these essences are things like buying, selling, ordering, contracting, and so forth.
1255280	1262560	And in the 20th century, Ludwig von Mises became even more famous than Manger.
1262960	1272640	He thought that all of economics could be captured in one single axiom, which is the axiom
1272640	1279600	man acts. And if you know what acting is, then you know everything about preferences and so forth.
1280400	1288160	And I don't think that Mises was quite right. But I think that the a prioristic view of economics
1288720	1294720	has a lot to be said in its favor. And I tried to express these things in this paper.
1297200	1304800	Murray Rothbard was a famous third generation member of this school. And he actually wrote a
1304800	1309920	very kind and friendly review of the book on Austrian philosophy, which I showed you.
1310720	1317520	And then there is Hermann Hoppe, who is a very interesting strange case.
1320000	1326000	I don't think I'm going to tell any jokes about Hermann Hoppe. Although I like him,
1326000	1331520	he's a nice man, but there are too many things you can make jokes about. So one of his books is
1331600	1338320	A Defensive Monarchy, which is, of course, correct, but you shouldn't say that. All right, now
1340960	1347280	what we're really interested in is something which I call the Munich-Gertingen-Krakow school.
1347280	1351760	And it's sometimes just called a Munich school. If you're being really clever, it's called the
1351760	1359200	Munich-Gertingen school. But I call it the Munich-Gertingen-Krakow school or Krakow. And the
1359200	1364240	Munich school began in Munich, and some of the leading members of the Munich school are listed
1364240	1369520	here. There are several others of equal importance, but I'm going to be focusing on these people.
1369520	1374960	And then we move into Poland. So Hermann Ingarn was a member of the Munich school who then
1374960	1383360	reconstituted it in Poland. And Karol Wojtyła is a... So in German, you can put the verb at the end
1383360	1392560	of the sentence. You can't do that here. Karol Wojtyła was a friend of Roman Ingarn and also a
1392560	1397120	philosopher, also very closely connected to Max Schäger, who's another member of the Munich
1397120	1403920	school. But we'll come back to him in a minute. All right, so they extended Hossal's formal
1403920	1410320	ontology to create material ontologies, just like all of these people are doing BFO.
1411040	1416720	So they worked on, usually on quite philosophical topics, but Reiner, for instance, worked on law.
1416720	1424720	Edith Stein worked on the state. Ingarn worked on art and many other things. And Wojtyła worked
1424720	1431680	on things like freedom and conscience and religion, I'm told. All right, so...
1431920	1441440	And Hossal hated it. So he said it was a picture book phenomenon ontology. This is not real
1441440	1447840	philosophy. Who cares about whether it's real philosophy? Nowadays, it's being shown to be
1447840	1455280	quite practically important. This is what he... So he was a real admirer of Reiner, for instance,
1455840	1461600	but he didn't like the Munich idea that you can take a discipline and then subject it to
1461600	1467440	essential analysis. So this is the Goettingen school, or the four important bits of it.
1468240	1474800	Ingarn was in Goettingen, Edith Stein was in Goettingen, serving as the slave of Hossal and
1475760	1482640	Reiner. It makes him look a lot older, but he never became a lot older. And then Krakow,
1482640	1492480	we have this gentleman, and two of these people became saints. Now, that's amazing. You have a
1492480	1501440	rather small school of philosophy, and two of his members became saints. And anyway, we'll come back
1501440	1508320	to that. So these were very close friends. Ingarn and Edith Stein were very close friends.
1508320	1512320	There were other female members of the Munich school. I'm not going to talk about them because
1512320	1518400	there isn't time, but on many occasions during the rest of these slides, and there are only about
1518400	1527440	300 of them, I'm going to use him. And many of the slides were put together some years ago,
1527440	1534480	when we could say him. And many of the people I'm citing also said him. But in many cases, I mean
1535120	1544880	her or him. So forgive me for the him, the repetitious use of the word him, in what follows.
1545600	1552560	All right, so this is Edith Stein, otherwise known as Saint Therese, Benedicta Acroce. She
1554560	1561040	merited the recognition of her sainthood because of what she did in Auschwitz, because she was a Jew.
1561600	1567600	She had a rather bad time because she was female. This was a time when females were not taken seriously
1567600	1574080	in universities. But she was brilliant. And she wrote major parts of some of herself major works.
1574080	1580480	So she was his, a slave is a bit unfair. But he never made her his assistant in where he would
1580480	1591680	have made a male is assistant. And so there is a book called walls are crumbling, which is about
1592640	1597280	seven modern modern Jewish philosophical thinkers who have turned to the Catholic faith.
1598080	1603520	Now, in order to become a saint, you have to become Catholic. That's taken for granted.
1604480	1612720	We're going to be talking about four of these. And I own a copy of this book, but I couldn't
1612720	1619920	find it in time to work out what he says about Husser. But I do remember what he says about
1619920	1628320	Reinach. And I'm not sure if this picture was available on the web. It's a picture of Husser,
1628320	1634800	I think on his death bed. So Good Friday, what a wonderful day where some of Husser's last words.
1636160	1641920	Yes, Christ has forgiven us everything. Now, I'm not sure that that's true. I think that
1641920	1648640	us right here exaggerate. And you can make up yourself, make up your own mind. So this man
1648640	1653440	was described by Husser as the phenomenologists, phenomenologists, because he was a very good
1653440	1659680	teacher who knew Husser's ideas probably better than Husser himself. And so people like Edith
1659680	1665760	Stein and Inga became phenomenologists because of Reinach's fantastic teaching capability.
1668240	1677040	He was a nice man and part of a nice family. But then he was called up to be a member of the
1677040	1683920	German army in the First World War. So he died at the age of 34. He published one major book
1683920	1691360	before he died and several very important essays. We've managed to collect other writings and publish
1691360	1702400	them. I was, well, we'll see what I did in that regard in a minute. In this book, World's a Crumbling,
1703120	1710320	Ursus Reicher describes, so his sister became a nun when Reinach died in the trench.
1711280	1716640	He'd been communicating with his sister with letters and his letters survived about faith
1716640	1722560	and Christianity and so on. Reinach never became a Catholic through a proper process of conversion,
1722560	1727520	but he was certainly a Christian. He was certainly not a Jew. He was born a Jew.
1728320	1734880	And so his sister became a nun. And you have to be a Catholic to become a nun. And she was,
1736480	1742880	I don't know the technical terms here, but she was admitted into the convent by the Abbas
1743840	1752080	with the following words. The Abbas knew Adolf. Today, we shall receive unto our number someone
1752080	1761840	who even according to the flesh is a sister of our Lord. Now, this is like comparing Reinach to God.
1763840	1773040	And maybe it happened, I don't know, but Ursus Reicher said that. Now, Reinach was a proponent
1773840	1778640	of phenomenological realism and Reinach has been taken more seriously in the French and
1778640	1783840	Italian speaking world than in English speaking world, but we're catching up. And this is a book
1783840	1789600	of Reinach's papers about phenomenological realism. Now, you have to realize that to be an ontologist
1789600	1795520	in the sense of immunity school or in the sense of BFO, you have to be a realist. That is to say,
1795520	1802640	you have to believe you're describing the world and representing the essences or universals of
1802640	1810080	kinds in the world. And so the many phenomenologists were all realists. In around 1910, people say,
1811200	1818560	Hossal fell on his head and this damaged relevant brain circuits. And so from that point,
1819120	1826080	they say he was an idealist. He didn't believe in the real world anymore. Neither did his major
1826080	1834960	followers. He became a famous representative of the German tradition of transcendental philosophy.
1834960	1843040	So he was like Hegel, Kant, and so forth. He picks at himself now as a great man in German
1843040	1849360	philosophy, which he was able to do, even though he was Jewish at that time, because people didn't
1849360	1857520	care. They did later. And so he really was treated as a great German philosopher by
1857520	1864320	the German philosophers of the time, and by the realist philosophers at the time. But they
1865040	1871680	argued with each other. And so there was a kind of interchange, a dialectic between the realists,
1871680	1878400	particularly Inga, who wrote several major works on this topic, and Hossal, who tried to fight back,
1879360	1886800	and in a way, the realists lost in the sense that they never convinced Hossal to become,
1887600	1893600	to go back to being a realist. But they won in the sense that they created a lot of very good
1893600	1899280	ontology, which we will talk about in a minute. Reina's principle,
1900000	1909680	in the sense of most well-recognized contribution, was to invent or formulate for the first time,
1909680	1915520	in an extended way, the theory of speech acts. So normally people think of that
1915520	1923040	theory as having been invented by Austen and Searle. The first hints of theory along these lines can
1923040	1927840	be found much earlier. In Thomas Reid, for instance, there are several passages which
1927840	1933520	describe what later became speech acts. Reina has a whole monograph devoted to the topic.
1934160	1942640	And it's a monograph which is about what he calls the a priori foundations of the civil law.
1943520	1950640	The a priori foundations of the civil law are to be found in something like an analysis of the act of
1950640	1956640	promising. And the act of promising is the principle example in many of the papers.
1956640	1965520	In the Austen and Searle tradition about speech acts. And so I, along with a German
1966400	1974080	colleague of mine, a brilliant man who died, also died much too young, edited the complete
1976160	1983200	text critical edition of Reina's works. It's 848 pages. And it's the most honest thing I ever
1983200	1989040	did in my life. So it really is a very, very scholarly piece of work. We have a whole volume
1989040	1995680	just to show all the changes, including misprints in different editions and so forth. Because that's
1995680	2003040	what the scholarly edition has to do. And if you don't do that, someone else will have to do it later.
2004160	2011840	So I spent some years devoting my life to Reina. I was one of the few people who were
2011840	2016160	attempting to show to the world that Reina had interest in things to say. And that the whole
2017840	2023040	tradition of analytic philosophy should be viewed in a new life. So
2026320	2032800	I asked chat GPT about this content, whether we were successful. Is there a contemporary
2034080	2040800	reception of Reina's philosophy? And so I asked this question twice. This is the first
2041200	2046240	at least twice. Some notable philosophers who have engaged with Reina's ontology of social
2046240	2053200	entities include John Searle. And then it says Searle has been a prominent advocate for Reina's
2053200	2059920	ontology of social entity. Now I've talked to Searle on multiple occasions. If I even come
2059920	2066400	close to mentioning the name Reina, he gets angry. He hates the idea that Reina would even exist,
2066400	2072800	because his wife also used to get angry. That would diminish the greatness of Searle. I like
2072800	2081600	Searle, I think it's fantastic. But this is a blatant lie. Similarly, Raimo Tuonella, who also
2081600	2086960	works on social ontology, he says, has also been influenced by Reina's ontology of social
2086960	2094720	entities. That's just not true. Then it says Barry Smith, well, this is in bigger type here,
2094720	2101680	Barry Smith has been a critic of Reina's ontology of social entities. That's
2102480	2108640	disgustingly not true. And then it says something rather bland about Kevin. So Kevin has also
2108640	2116960	engaged with Reina's ontology. That's true. But it's weak. Typically, chat GP team is weak when
2116960	2123040	it's when it says something which is true, which isn't always the case. And then I asked it again.
2125520	2132800	So it says, again, it gives the absurd thesis about Searle. Right, Hussal was a very
2133840	2138960	strong admirer of Reina. I don't think he was heavily influenced by Reina. He was an admirer
2138960	2145120	of Reina, because Reina was heavily influenced by him. Shaila knew about Reina. They were both
2145120	2153200	members of the Munich School. And I think this is just about true. Searle, we dealt with.
2153280	2160000	Charles Taylor has no idea who Reina is. And Rudolf Karna has absolutely no idea of Reina
2160000	2169120	and wouldn't care. And so, and then I try again. Now he mentions Ingellen, which is good, but he
2169120	2174480	mentions Dagfin Follersdahl, who was quite an important analytic philosopher who wrote
2174480	2180480	a piece about Hussal early on. But he never knew anything about Reina. This is just
2181200	2190400	typical chat GPT lying. And then we asked it for a fourth time, and it gave this list.
2191760	2198400	I mean, including Emmanuel Evina. And I don't even know if Georgio Agamben is, but he sounds
2198400	2204320	French. I mean, French in the sense of bad French philosophy, not French in the sense of not being
2204640	2212640	Italian. And somebody called Jacques. And so this is a real mystery. None of these. Most of the
2212640	2217920	people on this list didn't know who Reina was. Most of them would have hated the idea of Reina's
2217920	2223600	philosophy. So why does chat GPT think that all, I don't know, 17 of these people
2224640	2229040	have engaged with Reina's ontology of social entities? Well, I think the problem is Kevin.
2229680	2237600	Kevin wrote a piece on, well, so Derrida, the ends of phenomenology, attacking
2238400	2245200	many of the names on this list. And chat GPT has this piece in its training material. And so it just
2246160	2251680	Reina, Derrida, same page. So that means Derrida must have influenced Reina for something.
2251680	2257120	And all right, now,
2261280	2266480	Reina was very clever. He knew how to read philosophy. And he read Hume's treatise. And he
2266480	2272000	realized that there was a mistake being made, and still being made today on part of people who
2272720	2278720	are fans of Hume's philosophy. The one person who doesn't make this mistake is George Davies,
2278720	2284560	who I believe is now no longer alive. But he was a Scottish philosopher. Hume was Scottish.
2285600	2289040	But he was also interested in Hussal and Reina. And he wrote this piece
2289920	2296720	in which he explained that even Hume distinguished between the analytic and the
2296720	2305520	materially necessary. So in Reina's terms, the relations between red and orange and red and
2305520	2310400	yellow. So red and orange are more closely resembling each other than red and yellow.
2310400	2314880	That is a material necessity. It's not the formal necessity. So it's not analytic.
2315600	2321440	It's a material necessity. Most people will tell you that there are no material necessities in Hume's
2322000	2330400	philosophy. But Reina found passages in which Hume appeals to material necessities,
2330400	2334960	particularly passages where he's talking about sense date. So if you're interested,
2334960	2344160	you can look at this piece by Davies. And that's Kant. That's Kant from a different angle.
2347120	2356880	And this is a very nice paper on this whole unique phenomenology. And this is a passage from
2356880	2366320	this piece. So this man, Fréchette, who is French, but in a good way, he has a very nice
2366320	2371760	account of the essential structures, the work of the Munich phenomenologists. And he points out
2371760	2379040	that Kit Fein has rediscovered some of the theses relating to essential structures and modality
2379040	2385760	which were worked out by the Munich phenomenologists 100 years earlier.
2386880	2390640	All right. So just so that we all have the same terminology, to say that something is a
2391360	2397280	analytic means that it's a truth of logic or of mathematics. And it's a tautology. It doesn't
2397280	2402320	add anything to what we said. Synthetic is a truth with content, which means it's not
2402320	2408800	reducible to any logical truth. A priori is a matter of knowledge. To say that something is
2408800	2414960	a priori is to say that it's known independently of experience. And to say that it's a posteriori,
2415280	2421200	a priori is to say that it's known by experience and had to be known by experience. You couldn't
2421200	2431040	know it by logic. And Q is commonly held to believe that everything a priori is also analytic.
2432240	2437840	And the Munich philosophers like me and like many other people hold that there are
2437840	2445680	synthetic a priori truth. And the example of red is closer to orange than it is to yellow
2446560	2451600	is an example of one such truth. And we'll see many more true when done. And law is full of such
2451600	2462560	truths. So for Kant, however, then synthetic a priori truths can recognize synthetic a priori
2462560	2468640	truths. He thought you made a mistake by not recognizing them. And commonly, people do hold
2468640	2472720	that you made that mistake. Even you probably thought he made that mistake, although he didn't
2472720	2476960	think it was a mistake. But he didn't make it. That's what he didn't know.
2480000	2487440	So Kant thought that the only a priori synthetic truths are truths of Euclidean geometry and
2487520	2491920	Newtonian physics. That's about it. Causality, space and time.
2494160	2500160	For the Munich picture book philosophers, however, there are synthetic a priori truths
2500160	2507920	everywhere in every aspect of the out. And so this is just a few examples.
2509120	2515200	Just to start with, then this is more. And we'll see many more. These are just the first
2516160	2519920	set. All of these were dealt with by the Munich phenomenologists one way or another.
2519920	2527440	There's even an a priori theory of chemistry that was worked out by one of the female members
2527440	2534400	of the Munich school. All right, now what that's I've said, Reinhardt is important primarily for
2534400	2542160	his theory of speech acts. But I think he's even more important for a concomitant discovery,
2543120	2550320	which changes our whole view of the history of philosophy, I believe. And it's a view about
2550320	2557920	how entities exist in time. So for Plato, everything which exists is unchanging.
2559200	2565040	We can only have knowledge about unchanging truths about the heavens, for instance, the
2565120	2572240	geometry of the stars, because of course, they never change. Anything on earth, we can only have
2574080	2580000	beliefs about these beliefs will be guessing. Because things are changing on the earth,
2580000	2586160	so we can't really know. But we can only know about the ideal entities, such as numbers,
2586160	2594640	values and so forth. Now, another sort of history, and this was the typical American 20th century
2594720	2600400	account, says that every sort of history is about things which are always changing,
2600400	2604800	things which are part of the world of what happens and is the case, things which are subject to
2604800	2608880	causality. They're changing all the time, you're changing all the time, even this changing,
2608880	2615360	even this table is changing, even a slump of granite is changing all the time, because it's
2615360	2624240	losing atoms very slowly, but still. So this is the standard 20th century view, it's the standard
2624240	2635920	view often ascribed to Hume. And what Reinhacht did is, this is Aristotle's view. Aristotle thought
2635920	2642960	that there are empirical things, so he was an improvement on Plato. Plato thought everything
2642960	2649120	was unchanging. Aristotle recognized that they were changing things like organisms,
2649120	2660000	which were at the heart of his philosophy. Reinhacht recognized that there are ideal entities,
2661280	2667040	or entities which have the feature of ideal entities that they're not affected by causality
2667040	2675040	and by causal change, but which are rooted in history because they are made by humans.
2676000	2682480	So there are three sorts of history. There is the Platonic history of things like numbers,
2682480	2686480	there is the empirical history of things like people, and then there is the
2687680	2693840	a priori history of things like claims and debts and property rights and many, many other things
2693840	2700720	that we'll talk about in due course. Architectural plans would be an example, chemical sequences
2700800	2708080	would be an example, gene sequences maybe would be an example. These are all entities which
2708080	2715360	exist in history from a certain point, but which do not change. And until they cease to exist,
2715360	2721520	so you pay off your debt, the debt ceases to exceed, for instance, or you synthesize a molecule,
2721520	2726560	but it's so difficult to keep the molecule in existence that after a while you stop synthesizing
2726560	2733520	it, but that molecular pattern did exist for a certain period of time in the world of reality,
2733520	2743440	not just in the world of patterns. All right, so Anita Stein had a similar view about the state.
2744240	2754240	Now, states change, but there is something which she discusses in her big book about
2754240	2760960	the state, which is unchanging about a state, and it's in the same ballpark as things like
2760960	2770080	debts and claims. It's things like authority. All right, now, so Reinhardt was the principal
2770800	2777920	advocate of this view. He was, the view is extended even further in very interesting ways,
2777920	2786400	as we will see by Ingaarden, his pupil and friend, and by Edith Stein and by some of the other
2786400	2795600	unifinomenologists, but it was him who showed how we can make progress in developing an ontology of
2795600	2801040	these entities of the third kind, which arise particularly in the realm of social ontology.
2801920	2809120	And so there are various different kinds of social acts. The word social act was used also by Thomas
2809120	2814800	Reid when he was talking about what we nowadays call speech acts, but not all social acts are
2814800	2822400	speech acts. Many social acts are document acts. And in November, we're going to have a visiting
2822400	2830720	speaker or a visiting Zoomer who is going to be talking about not speech acts and not document
2830800	2840640	acts, but device acts. An example of a device act would be a clock. And anyway, there are many
2840640	2846320	other more interesting examples of device acts, but he is really keen on clock. All right, you can
2846320	2850960	see some of the details of what we'll be doing in November. In November the 6th, I think it is,
2850960	2857280	on the wiki page, but that's a work in progress. That particular entry in the program is a work
2857280	2863120	in progress, as indeed are most of the entry, depending on how well I do in finishing this
2864400	2868880	today. All right, so social acts are informing, questioning, requesting, commanding,
2868880	2875440	promising. Rainer worked out some of all of those things, and they each have an experience which
2875440	2883680	underlies them. So if you make a command, then you have to have a volition, a will, that the
2883680	2890640	command be executed. That's an essential law. It's a necessitation. And now, of course, there are
2890640	2896240	some lazy generals who just, it looks as if they're issuing commands, but they don't care,
2896240	2902880	they're just reading what their adjutant has given them, but they're not commanding, according
2902880	2910400	to Rainer. Just as if you tell a lie when you say, I'll give you $100 tomorrow, you're not making a
2910400	2918400	problem. Now, clearly, we see how Rainer deals with those kinds of cases in a little bit. So
2918400	2925520	enactments are what lawmakers do when they enact a law. For instance, when the mother decides what
2925520	2932480	time the children have to be home at night. And then there is an outcome, which might be a state,
2932480	2937120	a state of affairs, or something like that. So the state, which is the outcome of informing is
2937200	2942080	that the informee now knows the thing which the informer was informing her about.
2943760	2948480	And asking a question similarly, and there is another beauty phenomenologist, which I'm not
2948480	2956080	going to talk about, a man called Daubert, who did a great deal of work, very interesting work,
2956080	2963280	on these kinds of questions, including on the question of questions. And I, along with the
2963360	2970000	co-auth editor of Rainer's works, whose name is Carl Schumann, I wrote a paper about this man.
2971600	2977120	And he's called Johannes Daubert. And he's interesting because he never published a word in
2977120	2984480	his life. He was probably the most important figure in the Munich school. He was the one figure in
2984480	2992320	the Munich school who was allowed to criticize Husser to his face. But he was a farmer. He didn't
2993600	2998560	need a degree. He came into the university, discussed, and wrote notes. And he wrote
2998560	3007040	thousand pages of notes. And like Husser, he used the secret shorthand. And my colleague now,
3007040	3012480	unfortunately, not here, was the first person to decide for the secret shorthand. And so we were
3012480	3018720	able to publish some of his unpublished shorthand notes. And a lot of them were about questions.
3018720	3026320	So we published a paper about questions based on Daubert. And at that point, there was practically
3026320	3035920	nothing published about Daubert. Nobody knew the name. The A-U-B-E-R-T. So we start the paper by saying,
3036480	3043520	as is well known, Johannes Daubert has, I can't exactly how it goes on. All right, this is in
3043520	3051440	garden. And he's at age about 36 here. And so he's part of the Munich school along with Schäler,
3051440	3057040	who we will meet a little bit later and right now. And along with the early Husser, who was himself
3058560	3063360	engaged in just the same sort of work, but at the formal level rather than at the domain
3064000	3071520	specific level. This is the old Bodleian library in Oxford. And in 1971,
3072480	3077840	this is the old, I wasn't in there. I was in the new Bodleian library, which is much more boring.
3078880	3086400	But by accident, I found a copy of this book. And it changed my life. I opened it and I saw
3087520	3094240	tables of different kinds of modes of being, and then also tables of how these different
3094240	3098960	kinds of modes of being represent themselves in the past or present or the future, or in
3099680	3106080	speculation, hypothesis, fiction and so forth. And until that point, I had wanted to, as I said,
3106080	3112320	I wanted to write a PhD on aesthetics and mathematics. I already knew the name in garden,
3112320	3117760	and I knew that he was known for his writings on aesthetics, which is why I picked up the book.
3118400	3123920	But when I saw what he was doing with ontology, which was for him more important than aesthetics,
3124720	3131040	just he wrote about ontology primarily in Polish, which was a kind of hurdle.
3133280	3138720	So I immediately saw that I was going to write a PhD on ontology.
3140160	3145440	And I spent the rest of my life working on ontology. This was even more important than
3145440	3150800	Wittgenstein's tractators. This is the most important book in my life. And we'll see where
3150800	3155360	it comes from in a minute. Since Ingaard never wrote a book called Time and Modes of Being
3156000	3161760	in any language. All right, what he did was write a book called Controversy over the existence
3161760	3169920	of the world, which was published as part of Ingaard's contribution to the Polish war effort.
3170640	3175280	He was a bit late, but still. So he'd written everything before then in German, because that's
3175280	3181920	the language of science. It was then anyway. And so that was the language of phenomenology.
3181920	3188400	He was studying in Göttingen and collaborating with phenomenologies most of whom were German.
3188400	3194640	So it was published in two volumes, the second of which in some versions has two parts, so three
3194640	3204000	volumes. And then at a later stage, he wrote a third volume, so one, two, one, two, two, and then
3204000	3210480	three. And the third volume was published in German in 1974. The whole first two volumes were
3210480	3217680	published in English only recently. However, I can read German, so I knew the German edition
3217680	3224480	of this big book already quite well. And above all, I knew about Ingaard's book on the literary
3224480	3231360	work of art very well. So that was probably the third most important book in my philosophical career.
3231360	3241120	It's an amazing book because it's not technical, but it contains a whole amount of new information
3241120	3248640	about what literature involves. And it's information which is new, but information which you can't
3248720	3255040	help but realize is being true. In other words, it's not surprising, but it's not boring either.
3255840	3262080	And you see, it's an investigation on the borderlines of ontology, logic, and theory of language.
3262080	3269520	So his job here was an ontological job. He realized this ontological job by writing about
3269520	3275120	literature. And I will explain how that works in a minute. And then in another book, which again
3275120	3281920	was published only recently in English, but which this one was published first in 1931 in German.
3281920	3286560	And the other one, too, was published in 1931. There are many other writings of Ingaard, and these
3286560	3292000	are just the important ones for our purposes. Most of them were published first of all in German.
3293120	3297520	So this is the big book, volume one, Controversy over the Existence of the World.
3297840	3305360	And in this book, he distinguishes four kinds of dependence. Now, he's coming
3306800	3310880	from the logical investigations where relations of dependence are very important,
3311520	3318240	but he's looking at relations, varieties of relations of dependence. So one variety
3319040	3326400	is the dependence of a fictional character on its author. And then everything about the
3326480	3331280	fictional character is determined by the author. Without the author, there would be no physical
3331280	3336080	character. And there is no truth about the fictional character, which was not determined
3336080	3343520	by the author. That's called heteronymous dependence, or just heteronomy. Derivation
3344400	3352720	is a matter of coming into existence. So a baby is dependent on a mother and a father, too,
3353680	3359360	for coming into existence, but not for continually existence. And then
3361520	3366880	an entity is dependent on another entity in the non-self-sufficient input sense,
3367600	3373840	if the one entity needs to coexist in a single hole with the second entity. An example of this would
3373840	3381280	be color and extension. You can't have color without having some extended thing or extended space.
3382000	3388640	And then just plain vanilla dependence is depending on another entity in order to remain
3388640	3395840	in existence. So John's love for Mary goes out of existence if John dies. So John's love for
3395840	3404560	Mary is dependent in this plain vanilla sense, because it depends on remaining in existence
3404560	3413680	upon John. So this is the same story, but with examples. So derived entities are entities which
3413680	3418720	are dependent on something for beginning to exist. There's only one really good example of a non-derived
3418720	3429280	entity, and that's God. Everything else had to come from somewhere else, except whatever happened
3429280	3435440	just before the big bang. I don't know. But I'm sure there was something else just before the big
3435440	3441360	bang. And so even what was there just before the big bang was derived from something prior.
3442080	3448960	And then non-self-sufficient would be a color, and self-sufficient would be an apple or a person
3448960	3454960	or a planet. And then dependent in the plain vanilla sense would be a mammal is dependent upon
3454960	3460800	oxygen for its remaining in existence. But otherwise it's independent. It's not dependent upon any.
3462000	3465920	All right. So these are the four existential moments of dependence and independence.
3466800	3472880	And entities can have various combinations of these three kinds of dependence. So God is not
3472880	3480480	dependent on anything foreign. He's an absolute. His mode of existence is absolute. Nearly everything
3480480	3486800	else is very dependent. Fictional characters are very dependent. And in order to understand dependence
3487840	3492640	in gardens, started to work on the structure of military work. What are fictional characters?
3495120	3502240	So there is this paper by a poll called Hood's Simpsky, who hangs around in Austria these days,
3503200	3508640	which summarizes all of what I just said. The gray is the non-realizable.
3511440	3515680	So I don't think I'm going to go into details, but you trust me that this is a pretty good
3515680	3521920	account of what is possible given in God's approach. And this is only one part of the approach.
3521920	3526640	That's why he needs such a big book in four parts, because he wants to solve the problem of the
3526640	3533360	existence of the work. He wants to show herself who died before it was finished that realism was correct.
3534240	3543280	And this diagram here yields eight possible modes of being. And so the real world has to be one of
3543280	3553440	these eight, because these are the only options. And God is the first one, A1. And we'll come,
3553440	3555280	well, we can look at the others in a minute. So
3555600	3567280	I don't need to go into this detail. So this is a picture now of all the different categories.
3568080	3575920	There are ideal entities, which are not actual. They can't move, they can't think,
3575920	3583040	they can't do anything. There's one absolute being, which is God, which is actual. And God is
3583040	3591200	original and autonomous. And then everything else is derivative of our heteronomy. So derivative
3591200	3598560	are present continuance, like people and planets. And a slightly weaker form, which in God calls
3598560	3610160	post-actual, are past continuance, which are things like Julius Caesar and President True.
3610880	3617920	And you see, as we go from God to the present God, to the present events, and then to the past
3617920	3624720	events, and then to the future events, which are only possible, they're not actual in any
3624720	3630400	sense. We're getting weaker and weaker until we get to the non-actual, which are what in God
3630400	3635040	and the cause purely intentional objects, which are heteronomous and therefore derivative,
3635120	3643920	because they depend upon something else, which is true. And so we have something like a great
3643920	3655280	chain of being from absolute being to shell opponent. And so these are the eight possible
3655280	3662160	modes of being. So we have God and the time entities. And then we have ideal entities like
3662160	3667680	deck, plane, mortgage, and so on. Then we have present continuance, present processes, present
3667680	3677280	events, purely intentional entities and purely intentional entities of a weaker kind. And so
3677280	3686880	Inga wrote the literary work of art in order to show why idealism is wrong. Idealism would say
3687680	3697680	that the real world does not go here, present continuum, which is where we would want it to
3697680	3705120	go. So idealism says the real world does not go under present continuance. So how is he going to
3705120	3712560	show that the real world does not go under present continuance? Well, the only alternative option
3712560	3717360	is that the real world is, and this is the idealist view, the real world is a purely intentional
3717360	3725840	object. Purely intentional object is dependent upon, in all respects, for all its qualities, on some
3726560	3740560	author, some creator, some, some origin. And every creator of every literary work has only a finite
3740640	3747120	amount of time and therefore only a finite amount of text to determine all the qualities of its
3747120	3755600	fictional character. Therefore, qualities of fictional characters are always spotting.
3757200	3765360	They have loci of indeterminacy in Inga's terms. No real entity has loci of indeterminacy,
3765360	3770720	because for every real entity, if we have a question about any quality, we can always ask that,
3770720	3776560	answer that question by measuring or by investigating more closely. We can't find out
3776560	3784480	how tall Hamlet was by measuring. And the same applies to Sherlock Holmes, unless
3786400	3791760	Conan Doyle tells us that he was exactly five feet 11. But then we Watson, we still wouldn't
3792000	3796560	know how tall he was. And we wouldn't know many other things, but Sherlock Holmes and Watson and
3796560	3801280	their dog and the kind of whiskey they drank and so on. So this is the argument. This is why the
3801280	3806560	book on literature was a contribution to the resolution of the controversy over the existence
3806560	3812800	of the world, which Inga and Hustel have been fighting for the whole of their lives. So this is
3812800	3818960	a picture of a literary work. The basis of the literary work, this is, these are strata that
3818960	3823600	she wrote. And as soon as you've written literature work, you've created all the literature. So you
3823600	3830720	have word sound, because when you read a novel or a poem, you hear the words, even if you don't
3830720	3835920	hear them with your ears, you hear them with your mind. And you probably hear Shakespeare wrong.
3837040	3843520	Because Shakespeare Shakespeare's plays were written at a time when English people
3843520	3851200	spoke the combination dialect of Yorkshire and Danish, which doesn't sound at all like English,
3851200	3857360	but still that we hear we hear sound when we meet Shakespeare. When people perform Shakespeare,
3857360	3864000	they typically perform it in a non Yorkshire, Danish dialogue. Then we have meaning units,
3864000	3869520	because we understand the meanings of the sentence. And higher order meaning structure,
3869760	3874960	what enable us to visualize the places and the events and so forth. Then we have what
3874960	3881840	he calls schematized aspects, including quasi-century aspect, which are things like the color of
3881840	3889200	Juliet's hair and so on, which are spotty. Then we have the objects events and safety affairs
3889200	3896000	and adult, which all of these graphics for Juliet and Hamlet and Romeo and so on and so on and so
3896080	3906240	on and so forth. Here, as it is, Baker Street and Florence and Moscow. So Moscow is not present
3906240	3914960	in war and peace. It's not about Moscow. It's about Moscow here. And it would still be about
3914960	3921200	Moscow here. There was no Moscow in Russia. All right. And then we have at the very top,
3921280	3925680	and these are not necessary, value qualities, metaphysical qualities and other
3927600	3932080	features of a literary work, which exist from a certain point in time, if you're dealing with a
3932080	3938640	work which has a certain value. All right. Now, if you look at a musical work, you only have two
3938640	3943680	strapped. If you're lucky, you only have two strapped. Typically, you only have one,
3943680	3949040	namely the bangs and whistles, which make up the musical work. But sometimes you have value
3949040	3954800	qualities. It's a great musical work. But you don't have any of the rest. It is an opera,
3954800	3960960	and you have even more of it. And Inga deals with four different kinds of works of art
3962720	3967360	in this book. So an architectural work is not identical to the building,
3968560	3974400	because the architectural work can be spoiled, changed, destroyed even, and the building may
3974480	3981760	be the same. For instance, if you build a sequence of really ugly towers around the work and put
3981760	3986560	Mickey Mouse features on the top of the tower, then you've spoiled the architectural work,
3986560	3995040	but the work itself hasn't changed. So that's Inga then. So the scientific work doesn't have
3995040	4000240	any of the metaphysical qualities, and it doesn't have any word sounds. The sounds do not play a
4000240	4006080	role in that scientific work. And journalists, he has a paper on what he calls borderline cases
4006080	4011520	of literary works, which deals with things like journalism, etc. The difference is that
4012880	4019600	a literary work represents represented objects. So they are heteronomous. They're purely
4019600	4026160	intentional. Whereas scientific work, if you're lucky, represents objects and events and states of
4026160	4033440	affairs in the world. That's why there is no corresponding stratum inside the work, because
4033440	4044880	the stratum is outside the work. And then we have intentionality going through the representations
4044880	4051600	in texts and symbols to the objects in the world. Alright, now this summarizes what I said earlier.
4051600	4058560	So we will pause here and if there are any questions. Yes.
4058560	4080880	Yes, so he thinks that the past is such that I have to be very careful here.
4082160	4087920	The past doesn't exist. No, it's not actual, but it was once actual, and that's a pretty strong
4087920	4095440	kind of being. The future is not even future actual, because it may never happen. So the
4095440	4102240	future is always somehow probabilistic. And I think that's as far as he goes. He doesn't have a
4102240	4108400	sophisticated theory of time, to my knowledge. I'm sure he has lots of things to say about time,
4108400	4115040	but not in regard to the ontology. He talks about why he has this particular treatment of
4115120	4121840	past, present, and future. So time and modes of being, the book that I mentioned, is in fact
4121840	4127840	an English translation of parts of volume one of the controversy.
4130640	4137440	I just want to go back, I guess, to when you're talking about change versus
4137440	4146240	unchanging and debt. Is that an example? How does that fit into dependency? And why is debt
4146240	4155280	unchanging? Yes, so I lend you five dollars. You have to give me five dollars within the week.
4155280	4161120	That debt just comes into existence. And then if you give back the five dollars, then it's
4162080	4166720	doesn't change. It doesn't become more intense, or less intense. It's just the debt just there.
4168000	4174240	And there are many other things which are just there. For instance, if I was king of England,
4174240	4181200	we would have one. I could make you a knight. You don't become British, but your knighthood
4181200	4186320	would exist. It wouldn't change at all. And there are many, many others.
4187040	4194160	And where would that go into dependency? So the debt is dependent upon the
4194960	4203440	debtor and the debtee. And there are different things to be said, depending on whether it's
4203440	4208080	a debt which is captured in some kind of document or not. And it could be that the debt is
4208080	4213440	captured in the document. And that that document serves then as the basis for other
4213440	4217280	debts or other claims and so forth. But in the simple case, it's just
4219120	4222720	a simple relation between human beings. And it's a thick relation.
4222720	4230400	The a priori? Everything I just said, I think it's a priori. In other words, you understood
4230400	4235040	what I said and you nodded your head. So that's all you need. Yeah.
4235280	4242880	The huge schema with older categories, that's in the 1960s.
4244320	4249040	That is present already in the Polish book, which was published in 1947.
4252000	4254960	That is like dealing with so many things that have been
4255760	4262000	English-speaking throughout the martial arts. Yeah, of course. These were really good philosophers.
4262960	4266880	And you can read it in English now. That's it, isn't it?
4266880	4270800	Yeah, the real problem is that each column is one hundred something dollars.
4271600	4274240	Well, you can borrow, you can share, I don't know.
4275040	4281920	Library with that. Yeah. If it's not in the UB Library, then tell me and I will tell them to order.
4285120	4291120	You said that in the old schema of God is absolute. Is that a term you use?
4291600	4298640	That's his term. I just realized that the final book written by Yiddish Stein is called
4298640	4307760	Absolute and Finite? Finite. Yes, so there is a book of letters between Ingarden and Yiddish Stein.
4308720	4314240	And so they were communicating with each other constantly. I think, I don't know when the
4314240	4319840	communication stopped for a long time. And so they were, I'm sure, exchanging ideas
4319840	4327280	about philosophy as well. But I wouldn't want to say who was the more creative of the two.
4327280	4333440	I think I could say that Ingarden was the more formalistic. Do you like lists and things?
4335440	4342240	I like lists. I like pictures. When I'm working on a new topic, the first thing I do is
4342240	4345280	put the name of the topic in Google and then ask for all the images.
4345280	4352880	Can you just go to the bottom of the book as we do on the right list?
4357840	4362320	So the question is, are my sons serious? That's going to be the main one.
4363120	4371040	So the bluntness of, or the lusciousness of, or the right shininess of them.
4371920	4375120	So it occurs to me that we should send this around.
4379600	4382880	Your name is already there. Otherwise, put your name on there.
4384400	4387360	I'm not going to do anything with that sheet. I just want to know who's here.
4388800	4397120	Yes. So I'm back to his idea of time for existence on moments of dependence.
4397120	4403520	How much weight should we keep for the moments? I'm thinking, he kind of sounds like a grown
4403520	4410160	block theorist. So would it be something like the particular time slice that I think of it that way?
4410160	4417040	No, the moments are that they derive from the dependence-theoretic approach to sense data that
4417040	4424720	Husserl developed. Here, he took this from Stumpf, who was earlier and who specialized in
4424720	4429840	tone psychology, that psychology of music basically are. So if you have a musical tone,
4429840	4435680	you have a pitch, you have a timbre, and you have a loudness. They are moments of the pitch.
4436640	4442000	And similarly, in Gunn said, modes of being have moments, and you have to have one or
4442000	4446640	other of these. You have to have one of each moment, but the moments might be high or low,
4447440	4453920	if I still present the song. And so he worked out the moments of being and then had a way of
4453920	4460080	combining the moments to create modes of being. And then he could use that to solve the problem
4460080	4470560	of idealism and really. So Ingaardin did not say that the strata of the literary work are dependent
4470560	4478240	on the author. They are dependent for their origin on the author. But in order to be maintained in
4478240	4485120	existence, they need readers. And a different population of readers will be responsible for
4485120	4491200	maintaining the literary work in existence. And so literary works do indeed change. They're not like
4491200	4498480	debts or dollars, or they change. And that's why I put this curve here. They could even die
4498480	4504560	if no one reads them anymore, or if all copies done this job. But they still have some of the
4504560	4510000	characteristics. So they don't change the causal reason. They change because the readership
4511280	4517360	has different tastes, reads new nuances, which may or may not have been there on the part of the
4517360	4523200	author, sees a political meaning that may or may not have been there on the part of the author.
4523200	4529280	So Shakespeare's plays have already changed in a big way on the sound level. And they're trying to
4529280	4538320	change them these days also on various political and avant-garde interpretation levels. So literary
4538320	4544160	works are still examples of ideal entities of the third kind, but they change because they are
4544160	4552160	dependent upon things like audiences, critics, editions, editors, and so forth. So are they,
4552160	4558560	so under this theory, are literary works fully determined, but under determined by the author,
4558560	4564880	like the full determination of the audience? Yeah, so that's a very good question.
4567760	4579520	I don't... Ingaarden was a fan of very realistic late 19th century novels, if that helps you.
4579520	4589360	Yeah. And his proof, he says that in conclusion, idealism is false. Can it also just be saying
4589360	4601360	idealism is fiction? Well, no, because if we go back to scientific work, so scientific work is
4601360	4607040	meaning to be about the world. And the philosopher idealists who developed these theories did indeed
4607040	4612640	believe that the world is just a fiction. They thought that it was a fact that the world is a
4612640	4619840	fiction, where a fictional author doesn't hold that the world he's describing is a fact. It's
4623360	4626720	moving. Yeah. How do terminists, as some of you, translate a book?
4628640	4635360	Oh, so yes, so the life of a literary work may bifurcate or multi-furcate if you get many
4635360	4641760	translations and each translation, you may even get multiple translations in different cultures
4641760	4646560	then would have a different reading of the work. And so the work itself has a life which involves
4646560	4654640	multiple personalities. I once gave a talk at a German conference about Heidegger. Actually,
4654640	4662080	no, it was about translation. And my talk was, had the title Heidegger in German, Heidegger's work
4662080	4671040	is untranslatable. And there were lots of Heideggerians in the room, many, particularly Japanese
4671040	4679520	Heideggerians on the row. And the chair of the meeting was Japanese. And before I could even start
4679520	4686320	the first word, the Japanese all stood up in unison in the Japanese way and they all shouted,
4686400	4692000	of course, Heidegger can be translated. There are nine different translations of Heidegger
4692000	4697760	into Japanese. So in other words, I couldn't give my talk, it's the only time in my life I've been
4697760	4710160	prevented from speaking. All right, so works of art can have complicated lives, that's the
4710160	4716160	important thing, the life of the literary world. All right, now, I have a lot about Heidegger,
4716160	4722480	Ingaard's theory of systems, but I'm not going to go through that. I will. Actually, I may be able
4722480	4731040	to go through it quickly. So in volume three of the controversy over the existence of the world,
4731040	4738000	which is called the causal structure of the real world, and which is extracted in short form in
4738800	4749840	in an English text in a book called Man and Value. And the idea here is the idea of
4750640	4757840	relatively isolated systems. So I am a relatively isolated system, I'm a system, but I'm relatively
4757840	4765920	isolated because I have a skin, which isolates me relatively from the outside world. The outside
4765920	4771920	world can still penetrate and I can still penetrate from within into the outside world by speaking
4771920	4781760	or sweating or throwing or vomiting. But there is the skin and all animals have a hide or a skin
4781760	4791520	or some kind of closing closure, which which creates this relative isolation, which is a permeable
4791520	4804000	membrane, which allows us also to expel waste. And so there is one relatively isolated system
4804000	4808960	and the other relatively isolated systems, we talk to each other, we ask things to each other.
4813360	4818880	This is supposed to be a mind. So the mind is permeated by the external world in that we see
4818960	4828960	the external world, we move around within it and touch it. And anyway, if you're interested,
4828960	4834640	there is this paper called Ingardens Systems Theoretical Philosophical Anthropology.
4835760	4843600	So you can have tribes which arose from the isolated systems countries. And I have a whole
4843600	4853360	talk and a whole video on this, which you can dig around and find probably. So the world consists of
4854400	4861360	and this is why I want to include this just briefly. So I have lots of blood cells in my body,
4861360	4866080	which are moving around independently. They are the only parts of my body, which are not connected
4866080	4873440	by me to some kind of tube or pipe to other parts of my body. So my lungs are connected to other
4873440	4878160	things which are connected again to other things. But blood cells are not tied to anything else.
4878880	4884880	But all those linkages are relatively tiny. In other words, they are tubes which fit into a
4884880	4891920	large thing like the kidney or the heart and allow transmission of fluids and gases.
4893600	4897840	Rather like wires in the good old days allow transmission of most code messages.
4898560	4904240	So this is a picture of some of these tubes. And it's important that there's one rather
4904240	4910560	interesting tube here, connecting the mother to the placenta. And then there's something else
4910560	4918800	which goes here, which it's not so relevant. Actually, it is relevant. It's what I'm talking
4918880	4927760	about now. So there is a school of thought. It's not Irish. I think it's Dutch. It's in
4927760	4935360	Europe anyway, which says that the embryo or the fetus is a part of the mother.
4936960	4942560	And the argument is that it's connected and it's inside the mother. But if it's connected
4943040	4950880	by means of a tube, then that doesn't mean that it's a part of the mother. I could be connected
4950880	4957680	by means of wires to my headquarters. And the wires could be continuous. And my job is to transmit
4957680	4963520	most code messages to headquarters. That doesn't mean I'm a part of the person who's answering
4963520	4968800	my most code messages. And similarly, the fact that there is a connection which is going to be
4969360	4979200	disconnected very beautifully and smoothly when the time comes doesn't mean that the thing which
4979200	4986800	it's connected to is a part of the connecting system. So this is one system. And in this paper,
4988480	4995600	called 16 Days, which is about the ontology of the embryo, embryo ontology. So this
4996160	5008800	is the discipline of the gerontology. We argue that the embryo is, well, we don't need to argue
5008800	5013120	this. In those days, it was obvious to everybody. Now it's obvious to everybody except these four
5013120	5021920	or five Dutch and European ladies to work on. The metaphysics of pregnancy. And their main
5021920	5029920	thesis is that the fetus, once it's become attached to the mother, is a part of the mother.
5031040	5036080	And that's why the mother can abort the fetus any time she likes, because it's a part of it. So
5036080	5046800	it's like having your fingernails cut. Anyway, we argue that the embryo, let me get this right,
5046880	5058000	that the organism, which is the eventual baby, begins to exist at the latest 16 days after fertilization.
5059120	5065920	And in it, we say that the embryo is, I say this is what my line is. I don't know,
5065920	5071520	they're buried. It's not responsible for this time. We say that the relation between the fetus
5072160	5077840	and the mother is rather like the relationship between a tub of yogurt and refrigerate.
5080080	5083760	All right, that's what we say. And so in all their papers, these
5084960	5089120	metaphysicians of pregnancy, they quote that line. They don't quote the arguments,
5089120	5094560	they quote that line. They say, obviously, Smith is wrong. Therefore, the baby is a part of the
5094560	5103680	mother. But I say quite explicitly that you can be an object and still be connected by a pipe
5103680	5109680	or a conduit or some kind of wire. And that's what happens with the baby, that it's connected
5110800	5118880	by a conduit. And the actual surface area of the baby is much bigger than the thickness of the
5118880	5125120	conduit. And the same applies to lungs and kidneys and livers and so forth. They are objects too.
5126160	5134160	And they are part of the mother, because they have the same genetics. They have the same source
5134160	5140880	of food and oxygen and so forth as the mother. The baby doesn't have the same genetics as the mother.
5140880	5146640	So that's one of many reasons why the baby is not a part of the mother. So the baby is a system,
5147360	5152800	which is inside another system, but not as part and not as a subsystem therefore,
5152800	5157920	because a subsystem is always a part, but rather as an independent system, which is connected by
5157920	5170320	means of the tube. So here ends the first lesson. Let me get back to the main track.
5177600	5182640	We'll come back to most of that later on. This is Yorbsland Weber who taught me a lot about systems.
5183200	5187920	That's the book where we express this complicated theory of systems, complex system.
5187920	5192640	Now let's talk about Max Schäler. Max Schäler was a very interesting character. So he was the
5193760	5201040	Catholic Nietzsche, they say. That was how he was described. In other words, he was very,
5202000	5210800	what's the word, conspicuous. He wasn't a dedicated follower of fashion. He was a creator of fashion.
5211440	5216800	So during the First World War, he was the leading spokesman for the anti-British
5218880	5224960	campaign, because the British are just grossers. So we can't take them seriously. They have no
5224960	5234960	spirit, no geist. And so it's okay to beat them in a war. And he was a Catholic at various
5234960	5242080	points in his life, but then when he unconverted himself and then reconverted himself. And some
5242080	5246320	of the times when he was unconverted, he was also a professor of Catholic theology in the
5246320	5253520	University of Cologne. His sex life was very complicated. I can't remember the
5254960	5260720	I can't remember the whole story, but the one story which I do remember is that on the morning of
5260720	5269200	one of his marriages, he wrote, sent a telegram to another woman, explaining that she was the only
5269200	5276160	woman that he ever loved in his life. Which is also not true. I mean that she was the only woman.
5276160	5282080	Anyway, so it's very, there is a very nice biography by a man called Staud S-T-A-U-D-D
5282160	5290000	on Shayla's life, which I recommend. But his philosophy is, it's all over the place.
5290800	5297360	He hasn't been popular in the analytic world as much as he should have been given the good
5297360	5302560	stuff in Shayla, because there is a lot of embarrassing stuff in Shayla. And I'm going to
5302560	5309840	try and communicate some of the good stuff. So, and I have Voitywa in yellow here, that's because
5309840	5317440	some of the good stuff is manifest in Voitywa, who wrote his habitation on Shayla.
5320080	5329360	All right. Now, Shayla's idea, one of Shayla's main ideas is hysteria of feelings and emotions
5329360	5335440	and values. Now, it's clear that feelings can be of positive or negative value. So,
5335520	5343440	a pain is of negative value or negative valence, we can say. And a feeling of joy is a positive value.
5344240	5354880	But Shayla made a very elaborate technology of values and emotions out of these associations
5354880	5362080	between certain kinds of feelings and certain kinds of values. He said the only way we can
5362080	5371040	experience a value is via feeling. So, we don't have intellectual knowledge of values. We have,
5372480	5379680	let's say, value instances. We know when there is a value there, if we have a corresponding
5379680	5389600	feeling about what we see or hear. And so, if you see somebody torturing a helpless infant
5389920	5401120	and you don't feel badness, then that's because you are value-blind. And I think there's some
5401120	5407840	truth in this. Some people are value-blind. Pathology is a kind of value-blindness. Psychopathology,
5408720	5414320	the psychopath is somebody who is value-blind with regard to social values of various sorts.
5414320	5420080	All right. So, Shayla's idea is that the way we access values is through emotions.
5420640	5425360	And that means that we, sorry, the way we access values is through emotions. And that means that
5425360	5433920	we can categorize values by looking at the kinds of feelings that they incite. And so,
5433920	5441200	sensible feelings like itches and smells and so forth, they relate to rather short,
5441200	5447920	lived values, which are easy to fix, easy to change. So, if you have a toothache, then
5449440	5454160	if you take an aspirin, then you may, if you're lucky, be able to change it. So,
5454160	5458960	you can, there's a mechanical means to change these things. And this means that they are very
5458960	5466080	low in the value of value. Then we have what he calls vital feelings, which are bigger and
5466160	5472560	strengthened on the positive side and tiredness and weakness. So, you can see nature coming in here
5473520	5482320	on the negative side. Then we have psychic feeling states, such as euphoria and happiness and sympathy
5482320	5492400	and sorrow and anger and jealousy. And these come forth in all kinds of interesting psychosocial
5492400	5501520	phenomena like love and hate and empathy and so forth. And we can alter them through acts of
5501520	5508800	free will and through positive social interactions, he said. And then at the very top, we have spiritual
5508800	5516160	feelings, which are somehow absolute. They don't belong to the ego anymore. And the examples he
5516160	5521360	likes are all religious ones, bliss or wonder, catharsis on the positive side and then shame,
5521360	5529920	despair, remorse, anxiety, conscience and grief on the negative side. And these we can't usually
5531520	5541280	manipulate. If we have a feeling of bliss, then that's by the grace of God. It's not anything that
5541280	5551920	we can engineer. And we can't will ourselves to be in a state of awe. Either it happens or it doesn't.
5553120	5559280	And so, from this, we get hierarchy of values. So, we started at the bottom. There are utility
5559280	5567360	values, which of course, don't matter to us just for the British. Then there are sensual feelings,
5568000	5574640	which meant to things being agreeable or disagreeable. And then we have feeling states of the lived body,
5575520	5581680	which are correspond to mental values and vital values that I told earlier. And then psychic
5581680	5587920	feeling states correspond to mental values and spiritual feeling states correspond to the values
5587920	5599760	of the holy and the unholy. And this gives you a hierarchy. So, we have sacred at the top,
5599760	5610560	then wisdom, then virtue and then utility. All right. So, so much for this is Sheva's
5610560	5618880	big book, 600 pages or so. The idea is that formalism in ethics is the kind of ethics which
5618880	5625680	can be captured in axioms like the categorical imperative of Kant, which Sheva hated. So,
5625680	5632400	he thought that that's much too formalistic, much too intellectualistic values have to do with,
5632400	5639040	and therefore ethics have to do with feelings. The feelings are the basis of ethics. And the
5639040	5645360	get-out then is precisely something that will suffer from a violent line. So, the usual argument
5645360	5649600	against the view that feelings are the basis of ethics is that some people don't have the right
5649600	5663200	ethical feelings. And there is a very nice treatment of Fender's theory of the human world,
5663760	5670640	which I've linked to the wiki page. So, Fender was another member of the Munich school. In the book
5671520	5676880	on AI, we have a section on Sheva's theory of the will. But since we wrote the book,
5676880	5683280	I found this paper, and it is in fact a better account of the Munich understanding of will,
5683280	5690160	and therefore also of emotions. All right. So, this is Sheva's account, not Fender's account
5691120	5698560	of will. So, a man, I could have been a woman, but a man sees a drowning child and experiences a
5698560	5705920	feeling, it has to be a feeling, of moral obligation to save the child, and wills himself to save the
5705920	5712800	child and jumps in. And then Shaila says that we have overlapping stages, and we need to understand
5712800	5719280	the will by looking at these overlapping stages. We get the same change, stages, wherever action
5719280	5725120	occurs, in other words, because action always occurs on the basis of some act of will. So,
5725120	5731760	these are the stages, and Fender's theory is more detailed than this, and I think better also,
5731760	5738240	but this won't do for here. So, there is a presence to the acting person of the object,
5738240	5743840	the baby falling in the lake. A presence in the mind of the acting person, we could see a safe
5743840	5751200	guys, of the content to be realized, and of the sending value feelings, value feelings,
5751200	5758080	he feels that he has to jump in. And then there is a decision, and the decision that the actor
5758080	5765840	deciding of three parts, there's forming intention, deliberating how to affect the rest, so once you
5765840	5771680	decide you're going to rescue the baby, then you need to decide how you do that, and whether you'll
5771680	5778400	call the police first. And then the third part is the most important part, that's when you resolve,
5778400	5786320	that's a mental act of resolving, but that takes place at the same time as molecular
5786320	5795360	signaling events in your brain. And Shayla is, for this reason, as for many others,
5795360	5800720	to be taken seriously, even today, because he was never a Cartesian Jewelist. He always believed in
5800720	5807520	the mind, body, as being one thing rather than two things. So, these two things are both happening
5807520	5812880	simultaneously, and they are in some sense, they're two sides of the same coin, and that is where the
5812880	5819280	will actually kicks in, where you have a connection between the relevant parts of the decision and
5819280	5828960	the actual triggering of the event. And it would look like this, or so this is stage three C up here,
5829520	5838080	and that's stage four, but they're connected by nerves. And there's nothing here that we
5838080	5845440	can predict. So, one of the reasons why we can have no AI will, which Yorkson and I have argued
5845440	5853040	at length now, is because we'd have to predict that there would be this simultaneous decision,
5853040	5859760	and in the case of the AI, there's going to be a mechanical effect. And we can't do that in the
5859760	5866000	way which corresponds to what we understand as will when we are human beings willing. And Turing,
5866000	5870960	so in other words, we can have no mathematical model of this. And Turing says that we can only
5870960	5876240	model what we can describe mathematically. Now, the reason why will is so important for AI
5876960	5884560	is the same as the reason why we still, after 50 years, have no working chat box. AI can't do ordinary
5884560	5888960	everyday conversation. And the reason why it can't do ordinary everyday conversations, because
5888960	5895920	ordinary everyday conversation is soaked through with acts of will. We engage in conversation
5895920	5900320	because we want something. Immediately that we engage and we want something else because of the
5900320	5905440	response. And that the will ties what ties the conversation together. And that's why you hate
5906240	5911200	calling your bank on the phone, because there's no will. It's a tie you together.
5912000	5918960	All right, now, so the life world, I will talk about this at some other stage.
5921200	5923200	I don't think we need to go into this really.
5926800	5928480	Yeah, so we'll do this one. So
5929440	5934800	both Hussal and Shayla were, even though they were interested in the real world,
5934800	5938160	even Hussal was interested in the real world in his early writings,
5938160	5944000	we're not really interested in physics, or in chemistry, or in the sciences of the real world.
5948000	5955520	So, Hussal, sorry, Shayla used the term me lia to refer to the life world that we are living in,
5956000	5963200	which is a kind of simplified chamber, which extends as far as we can see,
5963200	5967360	and as far as we can influence, but it's not the real world because it has rules of its own.
5967360	5973920	So he says, the sun of the media, human beings is not the sun of astronomy, the meat that is stolen
5973920	5979600	bought on what have you is not the sum of cells and tissues with the chemical physical processes
5979760	5983920	which take place within them. Now, of course, he's just wrong
5985920	5994240	that that meat contains molecules. If somebody asks you to give you a drink that doesn't contain
5994240	6001040	any chemicals, then you know that they are wrong because every drink contains nothing but chemicals.
6001680	6010160	All right, so now this is another piece of history. So, when I first arrived in
6010720	6017520	Buffalo, the chair was a close friend of the previous chairman called Marvin Farber,
6017520	6024240	who was one of the leading phenomenologists in the United States, and he wrote a book on Hussal,
6024320	6031920	he hired phenomenologists, and the man who started this Marvin Farber lectures,
6031920	6038400	I think I was the only person who gave him that lecture. He wanted me to talk about
6038400	6045120	European philosophy, he had lectures, so I agreed. And so we started with Brentano,
6045760	6053520	who was the teacher of Hussal and responsible also for Polish philosophy and for Ustaz psychology
6053600	6059360	and many other things, that's where we start and the influence of Brentano on the Vienna circle.
6059360	6064080	And then Wittgenstein and the poets, I've forgotten what I had to say in that particular lecture,
6064080	6070000	but I do have the tapes somewhere. And then Kafka and the philosopher, so I've written about
6070000	6077920	Kafka and Brentano. Kafka attended lectures in philosophy and was known to philosophers,
6077920	6082560	he was known to them, they were known to him, although they didn't know about his
6082560	6087760	novels because they were written later. And then I have a chapter on Wojtyła,
6089680	6096720	Kazimierz Fardowski was Brentano's leading light in Poland. And then we have Hussal Heidegger
6096720	6102160	and the Crisis of European Sciences, I missed some out, so this is a shortened version of a
6102160	6110720	longer list. Then there's an lecture on the ink garden, then it begins to become even more
6110800	6117440	controversial, from Jürgen Hallermas to the Barden-Meinhof gang, and then the final lecture
6118640	6126000	was called Daring down the Suicide of Philosophical Reason. And the short form is writing to death.
6127600	6134720	And so the reason why I bring this up is because during this period I was actually
6134720	6141680	working on the philosophy of Karol Wojtyła. And this fits because it draws exactly on the
6143120	6148000	theory of the will of Sheila. So Wojtyła wrote a book,
6151760	6159600	the title is Person and Act, but an English translation was created which is somewhat
6160240	6166000	controversial because the translation involved parts which were not written by Wojtyła, they were
6166000	6173920	written by the translator, who claims in a very famous series of journalistic excitement events
6173920	6179840	a few years ago that she was involved with Wojtyła. And there was something going on between the two
6179840	6184720	of them, but I'm sure it was not anything, it could probably be called love, at least not
6185680	6192640	in his direction. Anyway, so there is now a new version of this book, I don't know whether it's
6192640	6196400	in English, but there is a new version in, well actually this looks as if it is in English.
6197200	6203120	This is part of the English critical edition of the works in Karol Wojtyła, volume one in fact,
6203120	6212080	so Person and Act. So Wojtyła was a philosophy student and a philosophy professor actually,
6212160	6217360	as well as being a priest. And in order to become a professor in most countries in Europe you have
6217360	6223360	to do two dissertations, one is the doctrine and the other is called a habitation, it's just a
6223360	6233680	thick doctrine and in France thick means a thousand pages. And the story I like to tell is that every
6233680	6240720	German philosophy professor has to write at least two books, one is on Hegel and the other is on
6240800	6252480	Hegel. And well Sheila was the main topic of Wojtyła's habitation, but Aquinas is playing a role
6252480	6259840	also because Wojtyła was a priest and so philosophy for priests is Aquinas and Cometries on Aquinas.
6261520	6268800	So it's a study of the human person, now Ingaarden talked about Strafer of the literary work
6268800	6273680	and Ingaarden Wojtyła were friends, so I'm sure that there was some interaction between them
6274640	6279280	in the English translation of the acting person, the original one, I haven't read the new one.
6280080	6287600	The word structure is used, but many of the passages suggest that stratum would be more
6287600	6295840	appropriate as we will see. So there are strata of the human person which are common to all persons
6295840	6301440	and to all human action and his book is about the strata. Jesus Christ is not mentioned anywhere
6301440	6307120	in the book, theology is not mentioned anywhere in the book, truth is mentioned and you know what
6307120	6315840	he means when he talks about truth, but he's not talking about what he means. And so Reinach has
6315840	6324720	an important distinction in his theory of speech acts. So there are two kinds of speech acts,
6325280	6332960	one kind of speech act, sorry there are two kinds of uses of language, one kind of use of language,
6332960	6341120	you're just speaking, you're not trying to act in such a way that the person you're speaking to
6341120	6347280	will be changed. So if someone says what time is it, you say four o'clock then that's not really a
6347280	6356880	speech act. So the difference has to do with what Reinach calls upon, phase doings of a person.
6358160	6366720	So like kissing or kicking or choosing and deciding, these are internal doings and speech acts are
6367440	6372560	both internal and external, they're internal because they involve you willing to act in a
6372560	6378400	certain way, but they're external because you act by speaking and that you're speaking to someone
6378400	6386320	else you want to change that other person. So this distinction between what merely happens in
6386320	6393520	person and what is a spontaneous doing of that person is the core of pointy words, account of
6393600	6402560	the human person. So these strata are what he calls enduring dynamic centers. So we're constantly
6402560	6407760	acting but on different levels and we're constantly having things go on inside our body on different
6407760	6416160	levels including physical things like blood flow and so forth, breathing and the trick is to try
6417120	6424960	to unify all of these dynamic strata and of course sometimes you fail and in working to
6424960	6436400	unify all your dynamic strata you create yourself. So acting, he says, is the first of many
6436400	6446160	dynamisms, it's conscious and but consciousness too is a dynamism so already action involves
6446160	6451920	another strata which is a conscious strata, you can be conscious without acting and when you act
6451920	6456080	you are conscious that you're acting but the action belongs to a different dynamism
6456080	6462400	from the consciousness and then they both depend upon various bodily dynamisms and then the question
6462400	6470800	is how do you how do you unify all of these dynamisms and these are five. So when we act
6470800	6476240	we experience our action as a doing of which we are the entity because we who are acting
6477440	6484160	we're causally responsible. We are aware that it reflects certain conscious processes called
6484160	6491920	desires typically that sometimes it's a bearer of a moral value or disvalue and then he says
6492000	6498480	that a drama of good and evil within ourselves which is another kind of dynamism and it reflects also
6504480	6509120	so I'm not sure what he means here these I think are his words so I think it means that
6509120	6515120	it reflects your consciousness of other actions that you've been taking and then it reflects and is
6515760	6520560	entwined with the external reality in which the action takes place including the external
6520880	6525040	reality of the other person that you are acting in relation to and of all their
6527360	6531840	and then the problem that there is this dynamism of feelings and emotions you see
6531840	6537520	see how Shayla is playing a role here I'm not going to go through this the problem is that the
6537520	6543760	harmony sometimes break so you may have an over-emotionalized consciousness and then there's
6543760	6550160	a struggle struggle between the intense emotions which affect your consciousness and your consciousness
6550240	6557360	so and that's where if you're lucky conscience will kicks in but sometimes consciousness losing
6559440	6567360	and then you the person as unity disintegrates and says and freedom you can't be free when
6567360	6573600	your personality is disintegrated that's what he says here freedom presupposes self-prediction
6575280	6579920	and freedom therefore presupposes a reference to truth and then there's a long passage here
6579920	6586640	about conscious conscience so consciousness is another dynamic dynamism which serves to control
6586640	6597040	over the goodness of the badness of our action so and now this the one interesting aspect is
6597040	6605360	that he thinks that this creates a solution to the mind body problem and so the mental and
6605360	6609760	bodily dynamisms are brought to a unity on a higher level constituted by the dynamisms of
6609760	6619760	human action so human action brings the two together and I'm quoting him now when he says
6619760	6628880	all men he means all human beings in German the word mensch they mean mensch but that means human
6628880	6634880	being but it's often translated as millions we will see all right so now we have the we dealt
6634880	6641920	with the Shayla school I still have a lot to say but I'll do it quickly so the Louvain school
6641920	6647520	that this priest rescued Husserl's archives from the Nazis took them to Belgium and hid them away
6648400	6653680	and created the Husserl archive which still exists and there are 40 something volumes
6653680	6659680	in the collected works which is nothing compared to Heidegger then there is the Liechtenstein
6659680	6666160	school and this is going very quick so Liechtenstein is here it's 62 square miles and it has its own
6666160	6674720	prince who is the sovereign and he's a real prince and Buffalo has 52 square miles I lived in Liechtenstein
6674720	6681360	for four years I was a professor of philosophy this is the royal family of Liechtenstein this is the
6681360	6687920	royal castle Liechtenstein this is the international academy of philosophy it's now called the
6687920	6693040	University of Liechtenstein but then it was a very small scale thing it didn't even occupy
6694800	6699280	this much in the building and I wasn't professor anymore when they moved into this building which
6699280	6707200	is very hard to reach I could tell you stories about this building but I won't now why was I in
6707200	6717840	Liechtenstein well on June 14th 1975 I gave my first ever talk to an international meeting
6718400	6725280	in Krakow in 1975 Krakow was a communist country I had already visited many communist countries but
6725280	6731280	it was not by any means trivial for an Englishman to visit communist countries it was a bit like
6731280	6739760	traveling to Europe when Covid was raining I managed to do it but it was not trivial now so
6739760	6745200	I go to this meeting and I give a talk on Romain ingarden and the aesthetics of mathematical objects
6745200	6752800	and see that's my dissertation and I can't remember what I said but all of the three
6752800	6761360	international speakers of this meeting were invited to the Cardinals powers in Krakow which is this
6762480	6772480	and so the Cardinal was Vaitiwa so I had dinner with Vaitiwa that's now this man was the creator
6772480	6777840	of the international academy in philosophy he knew that I had dinner with Vaitiwa but more
6777840	6783120	importantly and it's important because Liechtenstein is a very Catholic country this is a very
6783120	6791680	Catholic person he was the head of it that the academy was devoted to the philosophy of Vaitiwa
6791680	6797440	and to the Polish and Munich he was part of the Munich school very late part
6798400	6805360	so the Munich Polish precursors of Vaitiwa philosophy and he knew that I was the world's
6805360	6810400	expert on Reinhacht in England so he made me a professor and so I moved to Liechtenstein
6811920	6819440	and Liechtenstein is a very beautiful country two percent taxes and it's in the mountains
6819440	6824320	and in the middle of everywhere anyway so there is this Liechtenstein branch of philosophy
6824320	6830720	Dietrich von Hildebrandt was indeed a member of the original Munich school and Zeifert was his
6830720	6834880	student I'm not going to talk about Zeifert's philosophy you can read about it if you wish
6835520	6842880	I thought I would do another chat GPT trip so this Zeifert wrote a book on the philosophy of chess
6842880	6850080	which I think is his greatest work it's quite short and this is how it's described in his German
6850080	6855520	wiki page for some reason he doesn't have an English wiki page the German wiki page is very
6855520	6862080	long and very serious so I think there's been a misprint somewhere a misconnection so this is
6862080	6867920	just the paragraph about his chess philosophy so I tried in Google translate and it doesn't get
6867920	6874480	everything right so it says goes in the direction of an objective a priori of the nominal essential
6874480	6880240	all than empirically given ones necessary circumstances can be exceeded so about here
6880960	6887360	Google translators gave up and generated nonsense probably that's where they kick in
6887360	6894080	chatting critique deep L which is a German translation engine better than Google does
6894080	6900800	better I'm not going to read this but it it's clearly much too long the sentence so no good
6900800	6907760	English translation would ever have a sentence which is this long so I did a translation this is
6907760	6916080	the relevant passage in the deep L but I improved it so I cut I cut most of it he shows also the
6916080	6920880	cast conception of a general a priori I can be improved by stinging from an objective a priori
6920880	6926160	at the central walls from empirically given necessary states for chess about chess and things
6926160	6938800	like that so now finally Heidegger he really is a funny man so in being in time Heidegger according
6938800	6945840	to this the standard in a psychopedic philosophy Heidegger rejects the Hosellian and that means
6945840	6954480	the Munich notion of formal ontology transforming it into a fundamental ontology which is a
6954480	6960400	neo Aristotelian serve for what it is that unites and makes possible our varied and diverse senses
6960400	6966560	of what it is to be I think the English of this is quite good I'm not sure anyone can understand
6966560	6973680	it for them English is quite good and it shows that there was a kind of break even early Heidegger
6973680	6981840	was still infused by Shayla things there's a lot of the tone of voice of Shayla in the early Heidegger
6982800	6989680	and Hosell himself in his copy of Heidegger's being in time says that his formal ontology
6989680	6995680	is shifted into the anthropological all problematic he's shifting over corresponding to the ego which
6995680	7002880	is the formal this thing there is Dasein and no one knows what that is in the way that everything
7002880	7015120	becomes ponderously unclear and philosophically loses its value and then Galen so Galen he's
7015760	7022960	he's a follower of Shayla the Second World War got in the way of being him being counted as a member
7022960	7030320	of the he got in the way of a lot of things but he wrote a book called which in the English
7030320	7037920	translation is called man but in the German it's just damage so he was writing about human beings
7037920	7045440	which until a few years ago everyone would assume as a matter of course so damage his nature
7046480	7053600	how would you say that in the human being you can't say its nature and its place in the world
7054560	7062560	and chapter sorry the third part ends with a section on the Geist problem that we talked about last
7062560	7069280	week or two weeks ago all right so the background of Galen's work it's a really big and very
7069280	7074400	interesting work around a book around lots of things and there is a copy of both the German
7074400	7080800	and the English translation in the university library which is a very good sign of how good
7080880	7086320	the library is here and that's not just my view there's always good library Marvin Farber I think
7086880	7093760	was responsible for the quality of the university collection here all right so three aspects to
7093760	7101520	his work Shayla primatism and philosophical anthropology and so his first idea is that humans
7102320	7110640	what in German is called mengelwesen which means deficient entities so cats and dogs and
7110640	7115680	pigs they they are not deficient entities they have a wonderful life in their ancestral
7115680	7122240	environment and they never have to worry they that's because they have very very powerful
7122240	7126800	instincts they don't have to think at all they just behave instinctively humans have very weak
7126800	7133760	instincts we've lost most of our instincts so we have to make up for this loss and what this means
7133840	7141680	is that we have to use our weak sensory and motor abilities to change the environment to suit our
7141680	7149120	needs and that means we can live in many different kinds of environments we are as Galen says and
7149120	7156160	this is a term which Shayla also uses we have world openness so we can plan how we're going to
7156160	7160960	behave we can plan what kind of environment we behave in we can build a new environment we can
7160960	7166560	invent new kinds of environments and so forth so game playing games are new kinds of environments
7166560	7172480	we have these devices called chessboards and so forth new kinds of tourism new kinds of travel
7172480	7179680	spaceships astrobiology we can live in a world which includes also possible bacteria in distant
7179680	7186640	galaxies and we do all of these things so a rat wouldn't do any of that because do the same thing
7186640	7196080	every day we have an excess drive we always want to we go to philosophy lecture we read Arnold
7196080	7202240	Galen we do all kinds of things we do always new things and there's no equilibrium we never are
7202240	7211040	settled we die eventually but while we're alive it's always something new and that's why we need
7211040	7219600	institutions so uh the the um i want i s
7223360	7229280	that this is going to be the last night so we need institutions which are cultural not natural
7230320	7235280	because if we don't have institutions then we we're lost because we have such weak instincts
7236000	7242640	so we have institutions to create things like roads and electricity and electricity supply and so
7243760	7252080	all those services maybe even tree services but that means that we are by nature cultural being
7255600	7260400	that is the deep thought i mean if you're teaching the course on nature and culture
7260400	7266320	that is the deep thought and the part of Galen's argument for this thought
7266320	7273040	is that we don't know of any human beings who did not have cultural attainments the very earliest
7273040	7279600	societies are precisely societies with institutions and buildings and so and no matter how primitive
7279600	7285520	we find them they are still these institutions or cultural attainments they are still so fundamental
7285520	7289840	the human existence would be i think all without them all right that's the end
7295440	7295840	good
