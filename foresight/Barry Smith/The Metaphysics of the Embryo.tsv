0	6400	And I'm going to be responding to King Ma's presentation.
6400	12880	And we can summarize Elsa Lyne's view as follows.
12880	18000	There is something like a placenta uterine cord
18000	21760	foster, a myriological hole, which
21760	25160	grows directly out of the uterine wall,
25160	28320	just as a tail grows out of the cat.
28320	31200	And I'm quoting the paper, Pregnant Mariology.
31200	33840	Therefore, it follows that the foster,
33840	36400	post-implantation, and prior to birth
36400	39080	is a part of the mother.
39080	41760	She gives various reasons, which, again, I
41760	43840	will explain in due course.
43840	46160	Now, the alternative to this part-to-end view
46160	51360	that she discusses, which is an alternative which I embrace
51360	54760	and which we defended in the 16 days paper,
54760	56720	is called the fetal container view, which
56720	60080	says that the fetus is inside the mother,
60080	62440	but not a part of the mother.
62440	69560	And through her papers, and also at various points
69560	71440	during her presentation today, points
71440	74320	where she tended to raise her voice
74320	77320	and become very passionate.
77320	81880	This fetal container view is, she says,
81880	85400	a view no one has ever argued for.
85400	87840	And she thinks this is a mark against it.
87840	94920	All right, now the chief witness is an octopus, the argonaut.
94920	100800	And what Kingma refers to as its detachable penis.
100800	103680	But actually, if you look at the literature on the argonaut,
103680	107320	it's called a detachable modified arm.
107320	110880	And Kingma, in her way, wanted to see this
110880	114640	as being an archetypical male thing
114640	116920	to worry about detached penises.
116920	120960	But we don't actually worry very much about losing arms.
124120	130320	A hectotillus, it says, is one of the arms of male cephalopods
130320	134480	that is specialized to store and transfer sperm to the female.
134480	136600	And now comes the polite part.
136600	138520	Depending on the species, the male
138520	141600	may use it merely as a conduit to the female,
141600	146920	or he may wrench it off and present it to the female.
146920	148880	If you're an octopus, you can do these things.
151720	154800	The idea is that we can learn something about metaphysics
154800	157040	from the case of the argonaut, namely that there
157040	159800	can be detachable organs.
159800	161840	And the idea would be then that the foster
161840	163080	is a detachable organ.
163080	164760	So it would be like a kidney which
164760	166480	lives the life of its own once it's
166480	169680	been detached from its host.
169680	172720	Kingma holds the view that there are some parts, not organs,
172720	178360	but some parts of the organism, an organism like ourselves,
178360	180400	which do not persist through separation,
180400	183720	such as the heart or the brain, and other parts which
183720	186600	do persist through separation.
186600	193600	And these would include, on her view anyway, the foster,
193600	199120	the fetus embryo baby inside the mother.
199120	201760	I agree that there are some parts which can survive.
201760	204440	Many molecules survive.
204440	207520	In fact, all molecules, I guess, survive in one way or another
207520	209160	that we lose in the course of our lives.
209160	211360	So it's certainly true that there are parts.
211360	212960	The question is whether there are organs,
212960	216000	and the question is whether the foster is
216000	220720	to be regarded under this heading, which can survive
220720	223040	and become what embryos do.
223040	226520	Namely, mature adults, if they're lucky.
226520	231000	When I read Kingma's, sorry, Elsa Lyne's writings
231000	235600	on these matters, she repeatedly cites the paper 16 days.
235600	239280	She only ever cites one sentence, which is a sentence
239280	241760	about a tub of yogurt.
241760	246760	Now, the 16 days fetal container view
246760	249560	is also called the tenant niche view.
249560	255440	We regard the foster as a tenant in the niche which is created
255440	258560	by the mother through the uterus.
258560	261160	We give us some examples of the niche tenant relation,
261160	264000	one of which is the relation between a tub of yogurt
264000	266040	and the inside of your refrigerator.
266040	268920	She suggests that we'd never heard of the umbilical cord
268920	271240	in the placenta when we wrote the paper.
271240	272600	Of course, we'd heard about the fact
272600	275800	that the umbilical cord is connected to the placenta
275800	279640	at one side and is connected to the baby on the other side.
279640	285240	And she says that this means that the foster mother relation
285240	289320	or the foster uterus relation cannot be a niche tenant relation
289320	294760	because the baby shares an external boundary
294760	296800	with the umbilical cord.
296800	301240	She also thinks that given that the placenta has a maternal part
301240	304680	and a fetal part, there must be an overlap
304680	308160	or there must be parts in common between the baby and the fetus.
308160	312600	But that's not true, of course, because the fetal part of the placenta
312600	316360	and the maternal part of the placenta
316360	320120	are two different layers within one of the same organ.
320120	322640	They are separated from each other also
322640	324880	by some liquid or fluid filled cavity
324880	328600	as we will see ad nauseam in the next few minutes.
328600	332280	So it's really only number two, which is a problem,
332280	337600	but it's not a problem if you read the paper.
337600	340000	Now, there are two cases that we need to distinguish.
340000	341440	One is the future baby view,
341440	343840	where we're considering whether the future baby
343840	347280	could be the tenant inside the niche, which is the uterus.
347280	350680	The other is the placenta uterine cord foster view.
350680	354040	So this is the future baby view.
354040	357000	And this is what we said in 16 days.
357000	362240	So the issue, remember, is whether they share an external boundary.
362360	366960	Each substance possesses its own complete connected external boundary
366960	370080	analogous to the service of a sphere or torus.
370080	374880	We are, of course, toruses because of the chest if trapped.
374880	378440	Each substance possesses its own complete connected external boundary,
378440	382040	which divides its interior from its exterior
382040	386480	and at the same time separates it, especially from other substances.
386480	391000	The future baby has its own external boundary.
392320	394960	The mother has her own external boundary.
394960	399800	And on this view, the interior boundary of the uterus
399800	403880	or the amniotic cavity, we'll come back to that later,
403880	407280	is the relevant external boundary,
407280	411360	which is not shared by the fetus.
411360	416080	It's separated by liquid from the fetus.
416080	421320	So because the external boundary very often
421320	424880	will have pores and other gaps and still be an external boundary.
424880	428720	The external boundary is established by a physical covering or membrane
428720	435120	which extends continuously across all or almost all of its surface.
435120	438960	Almost all because typically there are small apertures,
438960	442720	pores, nostrils, your mouth, for instance.
442720	445560	The fact that you have a mouth which has a hole in it
445560	448320	doesn't mean that there is, you don't have an external boundary.
448360	452560	The fact that there are some organisms
452560	454440	which are connected to other entities,
454440	460600	for instance, somebody walking in space is connected to the spaceship,
460600	464200	or somebody inside a spaceship is connected by the spaceship itself
464200	466440	by various tubes and connectors,
466440	471960	doesn't mean that the spaceship and the astronaut
471960	474760	have suddenly become biologically one thing
474760	482560	so that the astronaut would be a part of this unified spaceship astronaut hole.
482560	487200	Nor when somebody is in an ICU,
487200	491760	which has been sealed off from the rest of the environment for immunological reasons,
491760	493560	and is connected by breathing tubes,
493560	499400	does it mean that the patient in the ICU has somehow become part of the ICU
499400	502120	rather than, as we can all see,
502120	506600	standing, or in this case lying, in a niche-tenant relationship
506600	510840	to the niche which is created by the ICU
510840	517160	and to the regulation of the person's oxygen needs and so forth,
517160	521080	which the ICU provides in virtue of the various connectors and tubes
521080	524840	which are connecting to the patient.
524840	531800	Now, it's very easy, well, it's relatively easy to disconnect those tubes.
531840	535200	It's relatively easy to disconnect the tubes even of the astronaut
535200	540280	providing he's careful when, or she is careful when climbing back into the spaceship.
540280	547320	Similarly, it's made easy, not by biology in this case, but by technology.
547320	553200	It's very easy to separate to stamps,
553200	556760	because stamps have perforations.
556760	563200	Now, there are some bodily connections which are similarly easily separated.
563200	564760	For instance, blisters.
564760	572560	The idea that Alphaline has to defend is that when the foster, on one view,
572560	576680	or the foster plus umbilical cord plus placenta on the other view,
576680	582240	leaves the mother, then a substantial change occurs.
582240	586800	Now, in the 16 days paper, we explain at great length what a substantial change is.
586800	589800	Substantial change is not moving location.
589800	593200	It's not changing the things that you're attached to.
593200	598360	It's not being viewed by people in a different way.
598360	601720	So on one day they view you as such and such,
601720	604000	on another day they view you as something else.
604000	607400	It's something which is catastrophic.
607400	610880	Two drops of water merge and flow into one.
610880	612040	An amoeba splits.
612040	615080	A block of marble is split and becomes two.
615080	617400	Or a pair of conjoined twins is separated.
617400	619920	These are big changes.
619920	626160	Moving out of the niche, in other words, becoming born, is not a big change.
626160	631040	It's just moving from one place to another.
631040	636320	So it's like the tenant leaving her apartment or the passenger leaving her car.
636320	642680	On the future baby view, it's not a case of substantial change.
642680	647600	But on the corionic content growing directly out of the uterine world,
647600	652240	just as the tail grows out of the cat, it does look catastrophic.
652240	658800	It does look as if it could be a case like a block of marble splitting into two.
658800	660080	There's a lot of blood.
660080	661440	It's painful.
661440	666760	And so Elsa-Lyne argues that we are dealing here with a real boundary
666760	674360	and that breaking of the breaking of which we bring about a substantial change.
674360	678720	And so she uses the argument that because of the blood,
678720	684720	it's more like separating the tail from a cat, which is not a non-trivial break.
684720	688960	It's not like tearing two stamps down the perforation.
688960	691520	It's something much more substantial than that.
691520	696560	In the normal case, in fact, the placenta does detach easily.
696560	700320	There's a lot of blood, but then there's a lot of blood in menstruation, too.
700320	704200	If there is a problem in detaching the placenta,
704200	708480	and thereby also in detaching the umbilical cord from the mother,
708480	710440	that's because there is something abnormal.
710440	712160	It's because something's gone wrong.
712160	716760	It's a mark of something going wrong that the placenta doesn't detach easily.
716760	721120	Normally, it detaches easily with a lot of blood.
721120	723760	All right, so this is how it looks.
723760	731280	There is the future vein connected to the placenta via the umbilical cord,
731280	733800	which is connected in terms of the placenta.
733800	737320	There is a fetal part of the placenta.
737320	739440	There's a maternal part of the placenta.
739440	744160	And there is a perforation kind of boundary here, not a fiat boundary,
744160	747240	which would imply no physical discontinuity,
747240	750320	but a bona fide boundary because the lining of the uterus
750320	756400	is a physical discontinuity as between the placenta and the mother.
756400	762200	My idea with the niche-tenant relation or the tenant-niche relation
762200	768520	is captured rather conveniently in a series of papers and articles
768520	770160	about the microbiome.
770200	774920	So 100 trillion good bacteria call the human body home.
774920	778120	They are all standing to the human body in the tenant-niche relation.
778120	778960	They're all tenants.
778960	780720	Some of them are friendly tenants.
780720	783880	Some of them are pathogen, and we want to get rid of them.
783880	786320	The baby is like that.
786320	792600	So we need to understand what it is to be in your home.
792600	795040	And that's a very complicated relation.
795040	798520	One of the argument strategies which Elsa Lyne uses
798520	801720	is to suggest that by viewing the relationship between the baby
801720	804240	and the mother as a niche-tenant relation,
804240	806800	we are making it sound much too simple.
806800	810480	We're neglecting all the processes of regulation,
810480	813000	many of which are catered for by the placenta,
813000	814760	which, as she quite rightly points out,
814760	817640	is an amazingly sophisticated organ.
817640	820680	All those processes of regulation are in operation
820680	823360	precisely on the tenant-niche view,
823360	825960	just as they're in operation in your apartment,
825960	828720	regulating the temperature of the air,
828720	832600	regulating the availability of water and electricity
832600	835160	and internet connections, and so forth.
835160	840120	So a home, whether it be the home of the baby inside the mother
840120	843960	or whether it be the home of the tenant inside its apartment,
843960	848760	is a regulated environment with all kinds of functional connections
848760	853800	to the outside world through all kinds of engineered equipment.
853800	856600	And so these are some examples of engineered equipment.
856600	859920	They all have functions, and they're all part of the home.
859920	863440	They're part of the home because they are functionally connected
863440	865280	to the workings of the home.
865280	868120	And the workings of the home may include also security.
868120	876000	So the reason why the amnion, the structure which houses
876000	878360	the tenant we call the baby, is so complicated
878360	883360	is because it's serving the purpose of keeping the baby safe.
883360	885200	That's why there are so many layers.
885200	887240	I'm back to the ICU again.
887240	890920	So your body houses 10 times more bacteria than cells.
890920	893000	Your body is home.
893000	896160	So these are all indications everywhere
896160	898200	in the biological literature of the niche tenant
898200	902760	relation as applied to bodies and things like bacteria.
902760	905480	And you find it also in the literature on gynecology
905480	906600	all over the place.
906600	908360	Else the line just didn't see it.
908360	913280	Trillions upon trillions of tiny passengers, bacteria,
913280	915320	when the baby gets out of the womb,
915320	917920	it's like a passenger getting out of the car.
917920	919800	It's not a substantial change.
919800	926200	It's a painful operation, but it's not a substantial change.
926200	927240	So what makes a part?
927240	929920	First of all, we're interested in parts
929920	934400	on the inside of the organism, like the tub of yogurt
934400	934880	in the roof.
934880	937080	Being connected is not good enough.
937080	940320	You could have the refrigerator magnets which
940320	942840	are connected to your fridge, but that wouldn't make them parts
942840	943520	of the fridge.
945920	947920	In fact, you can be a part of the fridge
947920	948960	without being connected.
948960	951400	There can be movable parts of the fridge.
951400	954240	What makes a part most importantly is having a function.
954240	960360	And Elsa Lyne sort of understood that in her way a bit.
960360	962720	She didn't provide a definition of function.
962720	964640	And we provided a definition of function
964640	965920	which you can look at here.
965920	967640	And it would be interesting if people
967640	971320	have counter examples of entities with functions which
971320	974160	do not satisfy this definition.
974160	978600	Basically, what it says is that an object Y has a function
978600	981880	means it has a disposition in virtue of the way
981880	983880	it's built physically.
983880	986880	And that entity came into existence
986880	988680	through historical processes which
988680	994000	selected for entities capable of realizing that disposition.
994000	996000	And there are two ways that can happen.
996000	998880	One is intentional design for artifacts
998880	1001160	like refrigerators and motor cars.
1001160	1004320	And the other is evolutionary selection
1004320	1006200	for biological entities.
1006200	1009880	I don't know of any other way in which functional, sorry,
1009880	1012600	in which entities with functions come into existence.
1012600	1015520	So two of that kinds of things have functions, artifacts,
1015520	1017760	and the component parts of artifacts,
1017760	1019600	and parts of organisms.
1019600	1022760	I do not believe that organisms have functions
1022760	1026760	unless you believe in slavery or unless you
1026760	1030760	follow Richard Dawkins and thinks that we are just
1030760	1034120	the functional artifacts created by genes in order
1034120	1036960	to propagate themselves through the universe.
1036960	1039080	I don't accept them, either of those.
1039080	1041480	So I can't think of any other reasons why organisms
1041480	1042280	could be functions.
1042280	1047840	Any organisms, whether bacteria or human beings.
1047840	1050520	It could be that we manufacture bacteria
1050520	1052680	and that we create artifact, and then they
1052680	1054480	would have functions because we designed them
1054480	1057840	for a certain purpose, to perform a certain function.
1057840	1059400	But I can't think of any other ways
1059400	1061800	in which biological entities can have functions other
1061800	1064080	than being parts of organisms.
1064080	1065120	Your heart has a function.
1065120	1067160	Your kidney has a function.
1067160	1070520	Your baby doesn't have a function because it's an organism.
1070520	1073480	Therefore, your baby is not part of an organism
1073480	1077680	because it doesn't satisfy that has a function relation.
1077680	1080560	Now, in fact, what makes a part in the biological case
1080560	1082040	is much more complicated.
1082080	1085400	And that we could divide it into two questions, namely,
1085400	1088440	the part question for small molecules.
1088440	1092280	So banana molecules, when you've half digested a banana.
1092280	1095400	Are the banana molecules parts of you or not?
1095400	1097040	That's a very difficult kind of question.
1097040	1099600	There are many questions like that which are difficult.
1099600	1101800	Fortunately, we're interested in parthood
1101800	1105840	for large granularity entities like fetuses,
1105840	1109000	even very small fetuses, are much larger than small molecules.
1109000	1111160	And so we can make progress here.
1111160	1112960	In the biological case,
1112960	1115960	being on the inside is clearly not enough again.
1115960	1119040	So a bullet inside your body is not part of your body.
1119040	1123200	Being connected is not so relevant.
1123200	1126480	So all the parts of your organism are indeed connected
1126480	1129760	to the other parts except for blood cells.
1129760	1134320	Blood cells are the only freely moving parts of your body.
1134320	1135840	They're parts.
1135840	1138760	And all biologists accepts the blood cells
1138760	1140280	as parts of your body.
1140280	1141480	So what makes a part?
1141480	1143480	Well, it can't be having a function either
1143480	1146000	because prostheses have functions,
1146000	1148280	but prostheses are not parts.
1148280	1152000	Hair satisfies the criterion of having a function
1152000	1154440	whose realization is necessary
1154440	1156120	for the host's continued existence,
1156120	1158520	or at least did originally satisfy that function
1158520	1162040	before we had home heating and air conditioning and so forth.
1162040	1165520	Microbiota are not parts.
1165520	1168560	The embryo is not a part if the embryo is an organism.
1168560	1172160	So could the embryo be something like an organ of the mother
1172160	1174720	so that it could satisfy this criterion?
1174720	1176880	Because an organ has a function.
1176880	1180520	In fact, that's part of the definition of what an organ is.
1180520	1183320	For Elsa Lyne to get her way,
1183320	1186360	we have to find a way of recognizing
1186360	1188760	that the embryo has a function
1188760	1191360	and so that it can be an organ of the mother.
1191360	1193520	It has to be a function which contributes
1193520	1196640	to the mother's continued existence or something like that.
1196640	1199360	In her talk today, Elsa Lyne told us
1199360	1203240	what the function of the foster is.
1203240	1207800	And I think this is the weakest point in her entire book.
1207800	1209200	It says the function of the foster
1209200	1212240	is to perform the reproductive function of the crevita.
1212240	1214400	Now, I don't think this makes sense.
1214400	1215920	I don't think it makes sense to say
1215920	1217840	that the function of one entity
1217840	1220040	is to perform the function of another entity.
1220040	1222200	The whole point of having a function
1222200	1223800	is that you have to perform it.
1223800	1226240	All of these things are things which have functions.
1226280	1228280	Of their own.
1228280	1230640	So what she said is a bit like saying,
1230640	1233000	the function of this biscuit is to enable
1233000	1236720	the performance of the cooking function of my stove
1236720	1238160	or of my chef.
1238160	1241520	Or the function of this gash is to enable the performance
1241520	1243720	of the slashing function of my scimitar.
1244680	1246720	Or the function of this engine air filter
1246720	1248760	is to enable the performance
1248760	1251840	of the engineering function of the automobile engineer.
1251840	1253960	It just doesn't make sense.
1253960	1255680	But there is a fourth criterion
1255680	1257920	because we saw processes have functions
1257920	1259600	which contribute to the realization
1259600	1261920	of the goals of the host,
1261920	1263880	but they are not parts of the host.
1263880	1266480	In order to be a part in the biological sense,
1266480	1269480	the entity in question has to be generated
1269480	1273880	by the coordinated expression of the organism's own genes.
1273880	1278560	And that's a standard thesis from standard anatomy.
1278560	1280040	That's how they work out
1280040	1282960	what the anatomical parts of the organism are.
1282960	1286880	I'll give you cloned embryos elsewhere.
1286880	1290040	But all other embryos are on this criterion,
1290040	1291880	not parts of the mother
1291880	1293920	because they are not expressions
1293920	1296720	of the mother's own genes.
1296720	1298640	All right, so the reason why no one ever argued
1298640	1300200	for the fetal container view
1300200	1302400	is the same as the reason why no one ever argued
1302400	1304600	for the view that two plus two equals four.
1304600	1305520	It's obvious.
1305520	1308000	And the reason why it's obvious to all biologists
1308000	1312520	is because all biologists know what mammals are.
1313520	1317960	Amniota, which comes from the Greek for lamb.
1317960	1322960	And it means an organism that lays its eggs on land
1323760	1327240	or retains the fertilized egg within the mother.
1327240	1331720	So the key to understanding where else the line went wrong
1331720	1332920	is the egg.
1332920	1335480	All amniota are characterized by having an egg
1335480	1339720	which is equipped with an amnios or membrane.
1339720	1342760	And the membrane is going to be a multi-layered membrane
1342760	1345080	which enables certain kinds of exchange
1345080	1349760	between the outside and the inside, protects the baby.
1349760	1352840	And in mammals such as humans,
1352840	1355120	these membranes include the amniotic sac
1355120	1356280	that surrounds the fetus.
1356280	1359480	So the amniotic sac is the niche
1359480	1361280	and the fetus is the tenant.
1362360	1365540	The chicken is the tenant, the egg,
1365540	1368860	the interior of the egg is the niche.
1368860	1370060	So this is where we are.
1370060	1374060	We are amniota, these are the chordates.
1375180	1377260	There are many, many other chordates,
1377260	1381420	but we are here in the amniotic part of the chordates.
1382460	1385820	And amniota include mammals,
1385820	1387620	but they include all kinds of other stuff,
1387620	1392020	including turtles and crocodiles and all birds.
1392020	1394220	They lay eggs, remember, just like we do.
1394220	1398300	So this is the anatomy of an amniotic egg.
1398340	1403340	There are 15 parts and this is a crocodile egg.
1403380	1404580	I didn't count them up,
1404580	1406900	but the yolk sac and the yolk are pretty obvious
1406900	1408460	and they're going to be present in every egg.
1408460	1411020	And remember that the chicken egg is covered in many pores
1411020	1413620	which enable the chicken to breathe.
1415180	1417820	Still has an external boundary.
1417820	1419460	In amniotes that lay eggs,
1419460	1421700	the shell of the egg provides protection
1421700	1425380	while being permeable to allow oxygen exchange in mammals.
1426260	1428100	Membranes that are homologous,
1428100	1431740	that means they have a common evolutionary ancestor
1431740	1435580	to the extra embryonic membranes in eggs
1435580	1437620	are present in the placenta.
1438700	1441220	So that's humans, that's reptiles and birds.
1441220	1443140	It's the same thing.
1444140	1446500	They're both a niche with a tenant.
1446500	1451500	One's inside the mother, one's outside the mother, laid.
1451660	1453900	The placenta is a fantastic organ.
1454780	1456500	It allows exchange of matter.
1458980	1462900	So that's the placenta and these are all amniota
1463780	1464900	and I rest my case.
1467260	1468100	Be careful.
