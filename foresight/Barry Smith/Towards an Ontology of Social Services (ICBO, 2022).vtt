00:00.000 --> 00:13.320
On the program it says the ontology of social services but this grew and it's become very

00:13.320 --> 00:15.560
complicated.

00:15.560 --> 00:23.440
So I've been working on the ontology of services for many years and with the distinction between

00:23.440 --> 00:28.440
goods and services and I don't think it's possible to provide a good definition of either

00:28.440 --> 00:32.080
of these two terms which will please everybody.

00:32.080 --> 00:38.960
We have to make sacrifices at the edges but I think that I've found a way of organising

00:38.960 --> 00:44.240
a lot of the data that we have about goods and services in a way which is interesting

00:44.240 --> 00:51.520
and potentially also useful and I want to use the word good to mean an independent continuance.

00:51.520 --> 00:56.320
I'll talk a little bit about the issue that Matt raised earlier about goods which are

00:56.320 --> 01:01.720
not independent continuance but for the moment I want to focus on this case and then I'm

01:01.720 --> 01:08.120
going to talk about services and I'm going to suggest there are really two kinds of services.

01:08.120 --> 01:13.600
On the one hand there are what we might call pure services which are just processes but

01:13.600 --> 01:20.120
then on the other hand there are the great majority of services which create things and

01:20.120 --> 01:23.280
it will become clear what they create as we go along.

01:23.280 --> 01:30.480
Now the starting point is national income statistics or gross domestic product statistics

01:30.480 --> 01:37.480
and the official tables for gross domestic product start with these items so personal

01:37.480 --> 01:44.040
consumption expenditures are divided into expenditures on goods that means either durable

01:44.040 --> 01:49.840
goods like refrigerators on young durable goods like hamburgers and then services so

01:49.920 --> 01:54.800
they are pretty clear that there are two different kinds of entity at work here and they're

01:54.800 --> 02:01.560
interested in these kinds of entities because money is involved and I am primarily interested

02:01.560 --> 02:08.280
in these kinds of entities also because money is involved but I think that the distinction

02:08.280 --> 02:12.960
holds even where no money is involved so this distinction can be applied for instance to

02:12.960 --> 02:18.160
the charitable work of a convent for instance.

02:18.160 --> 02:22.840
Alright so goods are material entities and they're created by manufacturers and farmers

02:22.840 --> 02:29.240
and so forth and then there are some people think there are immaterial goods I don't have

02:29.240 --> 02:36.040
a finished view on this but my current view says in the olden days software was a material

02:36.040 --> 02:42.760
good it was made of silicon and rubber and whatever floppy disks were made of today you

02:42.760 --> 02:48.280
don't buy software you rent it or you buy the rights to it you pay a fee so you can

02:48.280 --> 02:54.240
have a right to use the software and the same I think applies to insurance you pay a fee

02:54.240 --> 02:59.040
for the right to receive payments if you have a certain kind of loss so you pay a fee in

02:59.040 --> 03:04.720
essence to gamble and so I don't think these are good counter examples to the idea that

03:04.720 --> 03:09.920
goods are much material but as I say I have no finished view about this.

03:09.920 --> 03:16.640
Now one, this is a little bit of philosophy here so I apologise, one distinction that

03:16.640 --> 03:22.160
philosophers like to make is the distinction between intrinsic goods which I'm here calling

03:22.160 --> 03:28.000
ultimate goods which are good in their own right and not for another reason that they

03:28.000 --> 03:34.440
serve so these are all intrinsic goods you don't eat a hamburger because you want to

03:34.440 --> 03:39.200
bring about another effect you eat a hamburger because the hamburger is a good in its own

03:39.200 --> 03:45.640
right and similarly for all these other things so you don't read a novel because you want

03:45.640 --> 03:49.440
to achieve something else you read the novel because reading the novel is good in its own

03:49.440 --> 03:58.360
right well non-ultimate goods are goods that are involved in a chain of creation of ultimately

03:58.360 --> 04:03.600
ultimate goods so the steering wheel is a good because it's going to become part of

04:03.600 --> 04:10.480
a car which may be good in its own right and the design for a car is a good because it's

04:10.480 --> 04:15.720
going to be used as a design for building a car which is a good in its own right so

04:15.720 --> 04:19.720
there are goods which are goods for something and then there are goods which are goods in

04:19.720 --> 04:25.960
their own right and there are many on either side and it's important to keep this distinction

04:25.960 --> 04:32.120
in mind and if you want a little exercise you might think about whether there is a distinction

04:32.120 --> 04:39.520
between ultimate services and services which are for something else goods have an economic

04:39.520 --> 04:45.800
value but only if they enter into buying and selling processes and buying and selling unless

04:45.800 --> 04:54.400
you do it yourself are services so when you buy a car this is a picture taken in the max

04:54.400 --> 05:02.320
Heidegger RG which is the BMW sales center in Liechtenstein you deal with sales personnel

05:02.320 --> 05:08.920
who offer services what do they bring about they bring about a new pattern of ownership

05:08.920 --> 05:13.280
basically before the transaction you have the money and they have the car after the

05:13.280 --> 05:18.360
transaction it's reversed all right so there are buying and selling services but there

05:18.360 --> 05:25.680
are many other kinds of what we will call pecuniary services and the document acts come

05:25.680 --> 05:31.800
into play in a big way so billing and securing payment and registering payment and ordering

05:31.800 --> 05:40.080
and auditing and processing claims ranking hospital services ranking rankers of hospital

05:40.080 --> 05:45.720
services and so on all of these things are examples of services which have to do with

05:45.720 --> 05:58.040
the buying and selling the price determining side of things all right now goods are created

05:58.040 --> 06:06.480
but then they're bought and sold they're transported it need be to the purchaser or maybe to the

06:06.480 --> 06:14.040
finisher or maybe to the showroom where they can be shown to potential purchase and so on

06:14.160 --> 06:20.480
and then that maybe they're protected they're kept in a climatized garage or something and

06:20.480 --> 06:24.680
they're maintained and repaired and restored and so on over the years and then eventually

06:24.680 --> 06:30.600
they are demolished or destroyed or recycled disposed of in some way so there is a product

06:30.600 --> 06:36.360
life cycle the creation is the first step in the product life cycle maybe there's a zero

06:36.680 --> 06:45.000
step which would be designed now all of these things are services so most of what goes on

06:45.800 --> 06:54.040
in the life of a product a good is a service or involved services one way or another so these

06:54.040 --> 06:59.320
are services which are applied directly to material entities so that's another kind of

06:59.960 --> 07:06.920
ultimateness they are not applied to to people they're not applied to other services they're

07:06.920 --> 07:19.320
applied to goods and demolition is a service I get a hundred dollars for every contract

07:19.320 --> 07:25.240
that the bunker hill service is and then we have protecting services so you keep all your

07:25.240 --> 07:33.080
cars in a warehouse which is protected by watchmen and electronic fences and cyber security

07:33.080 --> 07:40.840
systems and so forth so certainly in the early stages of the supply chain for expensive goods

07:40.840 --> 07:45.640
there is a lot of protection going on and then later on there'll be more and different sorts

07:45.640 --> 07:52.280
of protection all right so goods are continuance so they exist beyond the time in which they are

07:52.280 --> 07:59.720
created so there's a common view which I used to embrace according to which services all of

07:59.720 --> 08:06.920
services are occurrence and I still embrace that view the common view will come in a minute

08:08.280 --> 08:15.080
so that process is performed by a service provider or by a company of service providers

08:15.960 --> 08:21.800
and now the view which I used to embrace for all services says that they're all what I would now

08:21.800 --> 08:29.240
like to call pure services which means that production and consumption coincide at least

08:29.240 --> 08:37.560
temporarily often spatio-temporally so a medical interpreter provides a service of interpreting

08:37.560 --> 08:44.040
and in providing that service that service is also consumed by stuff there is no left over

08:44.920 --> 08:51.160
and it's the same for a bodyguard a haunted house tour guide provides a service but you probably

08:51.160 --> 08:57.960
forget what you learned so there's nothing left over that may be the memories which will fade

08:57.960 --> 09:04.760
but no nothing which has economic significance for instance from any of these pure services I

09:04.760 --> 09:11.400
think pure services are a relatively small fraction of the entire empire of services

09:12.360 --> 09:16.200
so now let's move to social work and general medical practice

09:16.200 --> 09:24.120
are these pure services so they can both of them have outcomes which means that they're

09:24.120 --> 09:29.160
not pure services so in the one case the doctor may give you a bottle of pills

09:29.960 --> 09:35.160
in the other case the social work again may give you a script which enables you to get money and so

09:36.040 --> 09:43.880
both of them have alienable benefits and so they're not pure services so what about

09:44.840 --> 09:51.160
just advice so you go to the doctor or to the social worker just to get advice then there are two

09:51.160 --> 09:58.600
cases you ignore the advice or you accept the advice if you ignore the advice it's a it's a

09:58.600 --> 10:04.840
pure service it's a very very weak and strange kind of nugatory pure service if the advice is

10:04.840 --> 10:10.600
accepted however then there is something which survives and this is the central thesis of the

10:10.680 --> 10:20.120
whole talk what survives is because you accept the advice to go running every day or stop beating

10:20.120 --> 10:27.640
your wife or something the person who receives the advice acquires a new disposition and what

10:27.640 --> 10:33.960
that means is that something in that person's brain has changed there's a new pattern in that

10:33.960 --> 10:39.560
person's brain which serves as the basis for a disposition to go running every day or to stop

10:39.560 --> 10:48.520
eating chocolate or something so pure services create no issue they're relatively rare and the

10:48.520 --> 10:53.720
common view according to which services create nothing says that all services are pure services

10:53.720 --> 11:00.200
and we reject that common view with the view that nearly all services create specifically dependent

11:00.200 --> 11:07.400
continuance they create patterns quality patterns in for instance people's brains so these are the

11:07.800 --> 11:16.360
examples of services and they're all impure services in my sense so the hairdresser creates a new

11:16.360 --> 11:22.040
pattern on your head the gardener creates a new pattern in your garden and the teacher creates

11:22.040 --> 11:28.280
a new pattern in your brain and none of those patterns are alienable you can't sell them or

11:28.280 --> 11:33.800
store them or rent them but they're created by services and that's why we pay money for those

11:33.800 --> 11:41.160
services because of what they create not because we enjoy watching the gardener or because we enjoy

11:41.880 --> 11:46.120
hearing the hairdresser's clips but because we want the pattern

11:48.360 --> 11:54.280
all right now this fits into bfo as follows the disposition has as its material basis

11:54.280 --> 12:00.520
a new quality which is a pattern in the brain of the person who acquires the disposition

12:01.480 --> 12:07.720
so we have material entities which are people families goods machines for creating goods

12:08.280 --> 12:15.080
or transporting goods a pattern which is a kind of quality complex quality capability which i'll

12:15.080 --> 12:20.760
talk about next which is the kind of disposition the client of the social worker has the capability

12:20.760 --> 12:26.520
to go running every day and then the service itself which is a process and and now we can

12:27.080 --> 12:34.760
capability a capability is a disposition of a certain sort whose realization someone

12:34.760 --> 12:41.720
or some group could be an organism of a non-human kind but we'll focus on humans here

12:41.720 --> 12:49.320
has an interest so you all have an interest in digesting your food and so you have a capability

12:49.320 --> 12:55.720
of digesting your food your digestive system has the function of digesting food which is also a

12:55.720 --> 13:01.320
capability but it's a special kind of capability if you have an interest in the realization of a

13:01.320 --> 13:07.640
disposition that disposition is a capability we can now deal with hospital administration services

13:08.920 --> 13:15.080
in the same sort of way so this is what we have the simple services which have outputs simple

13:15.080 --> 13:20.760
patterns and the patterns are intrinsically valuable there that's the idea and these are all

13:20.760 --> 13:26.120
experts who have certain capabilities so that they're able to perform services which bring about

13:26.120 --> 13:32.120
these intrinsically valuable patterns but now there are more complex services such as hospital

13:32.120 --> 13:39.080
consulting services and now we get a two-stage process the hospital consultant bears the capability

13:39.080 --> 13:45.000
of the first type which is realized in the consulting service which has an output a pattern

13:45.000 --> 13:50.680
in the hospital which is the material basis of a second capability which is the capability of the

13:50.680 --> 13:58.920
hospital itself to smoothly more smoothly run than they did before the consultant performed her service

13:58.920 --> 14:06.520
if you're lucky now we we are going to have ultimate services and the ultimate services are

14:07.080 --> 14:14.760
just the first the simple case this case just the one pattern step and then non-ultimate services

14:14.760 --> 14:20.280
will be the ones which have multiple steps in the case of the consultant we have a two-step

14:20.280 --> 14:27.320
process we could have if you're teaching consultants to teach hospital managers how to run a hospital

14:27.320 --> 14:34.520
that's a three-step process there and another hypothesis that we I think is correct here is

14:34.520 --> 14:41.160
that many perhaps nearly all non-ultimate services are performed to create new capabilities either

14:41.160 --> 14:46.840
new capabilities in things or in organizations or in people that's just a hypothesis but I

14:47.560 --> 14:52.120
I have a suspicion that it's going to hold in many cases buying and selling I said yields new

14:52.120 --> 14:57.000
patterns of ownership now you can understand the significance of that thesis so that we're dealing

14:57.000 --> 15:04.760
with services in general as creating patterns and buying and selling our services and they

15:04.760 --> 15:11.480
create patterns in a very obvious way all right now let's go back to the protect restore eliminate

15:11.480 --> 15:17.640
kind of approach so we have this approach for goods so we protect our new car we restore our new car

15:17.640 --> 15:24.520
by repainting it and we eliminate our car by disposing of it but you can do these things

15:24.520 --> 15:30.920
also to patterns so we may want to we may want to restore the pattern that was established in

15:30.920 --> 15:37.480
our garden by the famous landscape designer 100 years ago and so we want to restore the same

15:37.480 --> 15:44.600
paint pattern not the garden as a good now but the pattern that was created by the landscape

15:44.600 --> 15:50.600
designer and we may want to protect the knowledge that acquired or the capability of our dog to catch

15:50.600 --> 15:57.880
beans all right but now we get another level of services because these processes are services

15:57.960 --> 16:04.680
which are applied to patterns created by prior services when they successfully restored the

16:04.680 --> 16:12.120
Darwin Martin house in Buffalo they went for the original seeds of the same seed stock

16:12.760 --> 16:19.080
as we used by Frank Lloyd Wright to create the bushes in the gardens and so forth and a lot of

16:19.080 --> 16:26.200
it had been sold when the house became decrepit during the period after the Second World War I

16:26.200 --> 16:33.160
think by the wife of the then president of the university of Buffalo she sold some of the windows

16:33.160 --> 16:38.360
which now cost if you can find one they cost $17,000 why do you want the original windows

16:38.360 --> 16:42.600
than the original bushes in order to create the original pattern as near as you can get

16:42.600 --> 16:48.920
it's the same universal it's the same quality pattern as near as matters so if you want to get

16:48.920 --> 16:54.440
the same capability to play tennis thing you have 10 years ago they can be applied to patterns

16:54.440 --> 17:01.080
created by services but the same distinction can be applied to patterns in general so you may want

17:01.080 --> 17:09.320
to protect an ancient forest which has never been touched by forest designers all right now we can

17:09.320 --> 17:15.080
see how this works for different kinds of services so teaching and training the creating is the

17:15.080 --> 17:21.960
coaching training in the gym and so on here the pattern protecting is things like follow-up exams

17:21.960 --> 17:29.640
and promotion reviews pattern therapy is follow-up classes more more more exercise pattern restoring

17:29.640 --> 17:35.240
is they send you back to school and pattern eliminating is brainwashing that's not a very

17:35.240 --> 17:43.160
good example but Ryan came up with that example but I thought it was good at the time it's still

17:43.160 --> 17:53.320
good for some purpose all right now gardening is obvious so you have anti-weed chemical spraying

17:53.320 --> 17:58.360
tree doctor historical garden restoration and then eliminating the pattern would be weed removal

18:00.280 --> 18:07.720
and dental that's obvious so creating the pattern is with the nears and caps that's creative dentistry

18:07.800 --> 18:13.960
and then protective dentistry as a mouth guard prevented dentistry and training in brushing

18:13.960 --> 18:20.040
and flossing restorative dentistry is restoring the correct pattern in your jaw through filling

18:20.040 --> 18:27.640
and then eliminating limited dentistry is removing the tube and medical in general well we have

18:27.640 --> 18:34.520
creative medicine which is cosmetic medicine and then protective medicine which is diet and exercise

18:34.520 --> 18:41.320
therapy for instance therapy itself repairing in other words the curing the infection resetting

18:41.320 --> 18:48.680
the broken arm or removing the tumor so these are all types of medical services which involve

18:49.720 --> 18:54.600
something created like that your whole body was created in the first place by your parents

18:56.200 --> 19:01.080
and then protecting what's created repairing what's created restoring what's created or

19:01.160 --> 19:09.400
eliminating what's created or bits of it and so this is a picture of the high healthcare supply

19:09.400 --> 19:17.880
chain so you want to protect the services of the hospital and that means you want to keep track of

19:17.880 --> 19:24.120
how all the bed linen and all the pharmaceutical supplies and all the patients and all the ambulances

19:24.120 --> 19:29.640
and all the fuel and so on are being delivered to the appropriate place in the supply chain at

19:29.640 --> 19:33.720
the appropriate time in order to keep the hospital and the ambulance service running

19:35.160 --> 19:42.040
not to mention the 911 service and so forth and now this is the final slide

19:43.960 --> 19:51.160
just to get back to social services so creative social work is where the social

19:51.160 --> 19:57.720
worker provides advice which in the successful case issued the nudist disposition on the side

19:57.720 --> 20:03.320
of the client protected social work is where the social worker reports the case to the child

20:03.320 --> 20:12.440
protective services that may be another partner for CBP and then prevented social work is

20:13.320 --> 20:19.480
counseling the client on incipient family related problems with the aim of preventing them from

20:19.480 --> 20:27.000
occurring restorative social work is social work with the goal of restoring those patterns

20:27.000 --> 20:31.640
which is characteristic of healthy family development and then I couldn't think of an

20:31.640 --> 20:38.600
example of eliminative social work so my name is Bart Gajdović I'm a postdoc at the University of

20:38.600 --> 20:47.880
Toronto at the Center for Social Service Engineering and we work on essentially data

20:47.880 --> 20:56.120
standards and ontologies for interoperability between social services and we focus on things

20:56.120 --> 21:03.880
like measuring impact of services and service provisioning on clients and so this is really

21:03.880 --> 21:09.160
interesting work that well that I've heard today but also that Barry has been working on and we

21:09.160 --> 21:16.040
kind of started this discussion at the the joel workshops we had a workshop there on social

21:16.040 --> 21:23.000
services and so yeah so this is this is really sort of interesting work in sort of defining

21:23.080 --> 21:27.000
services for maybe a different perspective or a different use case but I really like the

21:27.000 --> 21:33.640
the direction that this is going Barry so thanks very much and you don't have a question or a

21:33.640 --> 21:41.800
criticism I have three questions actually if there's time one is I'm trying to understand

21:41.800 --> 21:46.040
what a pattern is it is is it just a state that has some kind of structure

21:46.520 --> 21:56.040
so it's basically the idea of quality in BFO arises as follows there are two kinds of attributes

21:56.040 --> 22:01.400
that things can have one kind of attribute is what we call realizable which means that

22:01.400 --> 22:07.480
it's not really there as something which is manifest but it can be made manifest by some

22:07.720 --> 22:17.400
made manifest by some kind of external signal or process or some other means so and realisables

22:17.400 --> 22:22.760
we decide divide into two parts dispositions which I've talked about just now and then roles

22:22.760 --> 22:30.360
which Matias talked about yes Matias talked about earlier on the other hand are those attributes

22:30.360 --> 22:37.080
which are manifest all the time to the extent that the bearer of the attribute has that attribute

22:37.080 --> 22:43.080
and they they're called qualities and now patterns are just complex qualities that's all we mean

22:43.960 --> 22:48.920
so the kind of pattern that I'm thinking of primarily in many of these examples is a pattern

22:48.920 --> 22:55.000
in your brain so that would be a very very complicated electromagnetic electrochemical

22:55.000 --> 23:03.160
magnetic pattern and whether that well we don't use the word state as a technical term in BFO

23:03.720 --> 23:10.440
because we don't know what would be a good definition of state but I think the example

23:10.440 --> 23:19.560
will give you a clue as to what we mean by a quality pattern okay great my second question was

23:19.560 --> 23:25.160
so this is sort of there was leftover from the the previous workshop on social services but

23:26.120 --> 23:32.840
you mentioned that a service is only something that is either I think I think you said a

23:32.840 --> 23:39.320
legislative or has some kind of monetary exchange and so no no I I don't I don't think I ever held

23:39.320 --> 23:47.080
that what I and what I said today was that I'm using examples of services which do have some

23:47.080 --> 23:53.320
kind of commercial or pecuniary significance but I don't believe that the account I'm giving is

23:54.280 --> 24:00.920
exclusively going to hold for those kinds of cases so I have a I think a general view of service

24:00.920 --> 24:09.240
which is as general as your view of service okay so something like a community providing services

24:09.240 --> 24:14.520
to or some people in a community providing like let's say meal services to yeah yeah that would

24:14.520 --> 24:22.120
be a service in my opinion okay and the final question is this example of eliminative I was

24:22.120 --> 24:26.760
trying to think I was trying to think if something like removing someone's addiction would be

24:26.760 --> 24:32.200
eliminative but rereading your definitions here sounds like that would be more restorative

24:33.400 --> 24:38.040
yeah so I said that it was that the eliminative one was sometimes hard to find examples and I

24:38.040 --> 24:44.360
can't find even one but there is someone in the room who I think has an example I wanted to offer

24:44.360 --> 24:50.680
a limited to could be interpreted as a non-ultimate service through the cessation of the social

24:50.680 --> 24:57.880
service itself but that wouldn't eliminate the problem on the part of the client that and all

24:57.880 --> 25:02.840
of the other cases have to do with the problem on the part of the client and and you're not going to

25:02.840 --> 25:16.680
say kill the client no would it be maybe eliminating obstacles in the clients I mean if patterns are

25:16.680 --> 25:22.520
just in the client's mind would it be eliminating sort of cognitive I think that's preventive

25:23.960 --> 25:30.920
sounds more like preventive you're eliminating temptations for instance but as I say I don't

25:30.920 --> 25:38.600
think that there is that I don't think it's a sound category eliminative social service

25:40.760 --> 25:46.520
it just doesn't feel right I don't think it breaks everything but it does mean that there is a week

25:46.520 --> 25:56.280
point yes psychotherapy in Canada um so now I'm going out on a deep end but let's suppose that you

25:56.280 --> 26:03.960
had a kind of psychotherapy which counseled people to commit suicide and there have been cases in

26:03.960 --> 26:09.320
history where there were such kinds of people who went around counseling other people to commit

26:10.200 --> 26:19.240
but it's not a good thing yes pet okay good I will use it

26:24.280 --> 26:33.560
but yes I think you're still on uh no my end I think is down and you've answered my questions

26:33.560 --> 26:37.800
okay good
