00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
Good afternoon everybody. Bienvenue Ã  tous. My name is David Eidelman. I'm Vice Principal

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,840
Health Affairs and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and it's my pleasure

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,720
to welcome you all to a session on Healthcare in Deep Space, Autonomous Medicine Practical

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,480
AI in Advanced Simulation. This is the session's part of McGill Space Week as you know and it's

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,800
a signature event of McGill's bicentennial celebrations. You know, we just heard about AI,

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,320
we heard about the application of existing technologies and we heard about complexity

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,520
and space missions obviously are the prototype of highly complex systems operating in an

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,520
environment in which you have to handle lots of heterogeneous data and information sets and in

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,920
order to be successful in spaceflight you have to figure out how to do this and to do that you need

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,400
to really know what you're talking about and there you know Professor Smith's going to describe

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,720
the foundational principles necessary to integrate all aspects of complex systems including emission

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,360
systems using biologic and other data and into an information architecture that really supports the

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:19,280
use of advanced modular algorithms and so Professor Smith the floor is yours. I'm going to transfer

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:27,520
over take it away. Good so I'm not going to be able to do all of that but I will try and do at least

15
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:35,760
some samples which will give you an idea of how it could be done and I'll start with some background so

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,640
I started life as a philosopher working on metaphysics. Recently I started a whole new

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:51,120
line of thinking. I'm about to publish a book with a German AI entrepreneur colleague of mine on

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,480
artificial intelligence which more or less agrees with everything that Gary Marcus says

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:06,000
in his book but takes it further so we try and document in great detail the limits of AI when

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,040
dealing specifically with complex systems such as organisms and missions to Mars and so forth

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,520
and if we've got time I may come back to show the relevance of that to the main topic here

22
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:29,440
so which goes back to 2002 when I was awarded a prize to establish an institute in Germany to

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,680
deal with the ontology of medicine and this prize was awarded because people working in

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,440
computational ontology already then had started to use some of my ideas from philosophical ontology

25
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,600
so I started the institute and the first thing I realized was that I was probably going to be

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,400
spending the rest of my life studying one single ontology which was the gene ontology which John

27
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:06,800
mentioned already. Gene ontology solved a very considerable problem namely the problem of making

28
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:15,280
human genome and mouse genome and fly genome data useful for medicine and the idea was that the

29
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:23,440
gene ontology provided a systematic semantically well-grounded common consensus terminology across

30
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:32,240
all organisms and all disciplines which could be used to tag sequences whether they're gene sequences

31
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:41,360
or protein sequences or any other kind of sequence and this was a great success it was

32
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,480
brought to my attention very early on in working in this new institute and the first thing I realized

33
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:56,720
about it was that it was full of mistakes and mistakes of a logical nature which a philosopher

34
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:05,520
learns about in the first logic class at the beginning of their studies and so I had money for

35
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,600
the new institute I invited the leadership of the gene ontology to come to the institute in Leipzig

36
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,240
and I went through pointing out all the mistakes that they were making so this is just one example

37
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:27,920
a lytic vacuole within a protein storage vacuole is classified by the gene ontology as a protein

38
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:34,720
storage vacuole it was then this is a bit like saying that an embryo within a uterus is a uterus

39
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,600
it's an ontological mistake of a very simple logical sort and in those days the gene ontology

40
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:50,000
was full of such mistakes it was also doing the job of providing semantic definitions useful to humans

41
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,080
in a in a way which involved similar kinds of mistakes so this is a circular definition

42
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,360
it's not a good definition doesn't it doesn't and it cannot tell you anything about the meaning

43
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,480
of hemolysis because the word is used in the definition so I presented a talk at the meeting

44
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,160
in Leipzig entitled stop or smart terminology through ontological principles

45
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:24,960
and the the head of the gene ontology initiative Michael Ashburner at the end of who was in the room

46
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,680
on the front row smiling throughout he took me behind the curtain and he made a deal with me

47
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,880
he said Barry I will put you in charge of the logic of the gene ontology and in return you

48
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:47,040
promise never to criticize the gene ontology in public and I I sold my soul I said yes

49
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,680
I'm not criticizing the gene ontology today the gene ontology has improved in part I think because

50
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:03,680
of some of the things I did but more importantly I helped the gene ontology to marshal or heard the

51
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,160
many cats that is to say the many other ontologies which were being built in biomedicine in its

52
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,200
wake ontologies in areas like proteomics or anatomy or disease and some of the ontologies

53
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,920
mentioned by John earlier today were built precisely in this effervescence of ontology

54
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,960
creativity in medicine or in let's say biology to be careful which arose as a result of the

55
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:38,640
success of the gene ontology so the oboe foundry is a collection of ontologies which are built to

56
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:46,000
be interoperable from the very start so this is anticipating silos and deliberately taking

57
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,440
steps establishing principles to avoid the the appearance of those silos by ensuring that

58
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,240
everybody involved in the ontology building effort is aware of what everyone else who is involved

59
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,600
in the ontology building effort at the points where the ontology is overlap so that the overlap

60
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,360
is always such that the ontologies which do overlap are consistent in those areas

61
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,560
so this is a picture of the of the oboe foundry as it then was basic formal ontology is

62
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,080
the very top level of the gene ontology it's a reverse engineered generalization of the

63
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:35,040
gene ontology which covers everything in the universe but only at a very general metaphysical

64
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:42,160
level and we'll see a bit more about what that means later on so basic formal ontology is the key

65
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,760
to the unifiability of all the ontologies which are built in a way that descends from basic

66
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,920
formal ontology it provides the starting point for defining the terms in non-circular ways

67
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:04,800
in principle in every other ontology we've got now to 2005 now this this is a hub and

68
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,040
spokes model of ontology development you start with the top level and then you move to a slightly

69
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,760
the most specific level and then you move from there to a slightly more specific level all the

70
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:23,280
while maintaining maximal consistency in areas where ontology is overlap and this works it worked

71
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:32,560
really well and the army heard about it and in 2008 I was presenting a talk which was designed to

72
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:39,520
help the army solve problems that they had with silos in their data from Afghanistan at the time

73
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:46,960
and it was the army eventually which sponsored the proposal to make BFO an international standard

74
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:54,960
ISO IEC 21838-2 I'll come back to that well it's here actually there are two parts the first part

75
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,880
standardize is what it means to be a top level ontology so an ontology that can serve as a

76
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,400
universal general hub for the spokes which are created by domain ontologies and then part two

77
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:16,320
shows that BFO is satisfying the requirements for being a top level ontology set forth in part one

78
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,440
and these standards are both in the public domain you don't have to pay for them and BFO of course

79
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,160
is also in the public domain it's used now by some 500 different initiatives and the number

80
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:35,520
grows all the time so in 2010 my colleagues in Buffalo received a very large IR per grant to

81
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,040
create a set of ontologies to deal with everything in the universe these are called the common core

82
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,760
ontologies they they were built to satisfy some needs of the intelligence community which are

83
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,520
not important here but what is important is that some of the ontologies within that ecosystem

84
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:03,120
were created for space and this is just a few examples so this is the common core ontologies

85
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:10,160
ecosystem the space ontologies are down here so we have space event ontology space object

86
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,760
ontology is space mission ontology and stuff and we deal with things like residence space

87
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:22,560
objects such as satellites missions functions components and so forth these are the space

88
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:30,240
objects and then we have object aggregates we have orbits so this is the ontology of different

89
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:38,320
kinds of orbits you thought the idea of orbit was simple and it is not simple and then we have

90
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:48,320
missions and maneuvers we have sensors and now we get back to medicine so John made a number of

91
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:56,960
points concerning what we would need to address if we wanted to have useful medicine ontology

92
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,080
and it's rather easy it's probably too easy to build ontologies the problem is to build useful

93
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:11,280
ontologies and useful ontologies should be interoperable with existing useful ontologies

94
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:17,440
and so there is a certain homesteading effect in the world of ontology if you have ontologies which

95
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,480
are already serving a purpose and doing it very well then you should if you want to build an

96
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,200
ontology in a related domain you should ensure that you build your ontology by using what exists

97
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,400
already as your starting point this very often doesn't happen because you get paid for doing

98
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:43,600
something new and for reusing what already exists it's hard to get paid and so there is a certain

99
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,120
tendency to promote silo formation of the sort which John described so how do we build a useful

100
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,720
space medicine ontology that was in fact part of what we were trying to do from the very beginning

101
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,400
in the medical information science although of course we had no idea that this would become

102
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:09,200
particularly relevant in the in the space context so what we want to do is to document

103
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,800
medical knowledge especially as it's relevant to space travel and then we want to find an optimal

104
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,360
way in which relevant knowledge can be retrieved on a mission and the idea would be that you have

105
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,240
all the medical knowledge that there is and you have some way of finding the medical knowledge

106
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,040
that you need that can then find that knowledge very quickly and very successfully and the problem is

107
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,280
that all the medical knowledge that you have is full of garbage and this is one of the reasons why

108
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:48,560
foundation models as described by Gary are so unhelpful when it comes to mission critical

109
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,760
applications so why is the and totality of medical knowledge that we have full of garbage well first

110
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:03,920
of all doctors make mistakes and medical science advances doctors don't always keep pace with medical

111
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,280
advances some of them do some of them don't and so doctors have conflicts they have inconsistent

112
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:16,400
diagnoses sometimes for the same patient and all of this gets added to the totality of medical

113
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:23,760
knowledge all of the EMRs which exist and all of the problem lists which exist grow and get bigger

114
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,440
and bigger and get added to the totality of medical knowledge all records are still records

115
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,760
when doctors make diagnoses clinical coders have to document those diagnoses using clinical codes

116
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,920
and those clinical coders make errors in coding and they have certain tendencies and habits to code

117
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,840
in certain ways and different coders have different habits and then worst of all and that's what I'm

118
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,600
going to talk about next is that the coding systems change and this is good because medical science

119
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,520
advances but the coding systems should change gracefully and they should change in such a way

120
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:09,040
that changes then can be fed back to filter out the consequences of the older systems which have

121
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:16,640
been shown to be no longer scientifically coherent and even worse than coding systems themselves

122
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:24,080
ferment errors because some of the coding systems are to be honest badly built and and then coding

123
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,920
systems generate forking this is a problem that we will see in a minute all right now I could say

124
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,120
bad things about most medical coding systems I'm afraid I had a a long career in which I was

125
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,040
comparable to the little boy who says that the emperor does not have any clothes where the emperor

126
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:50,960
were was world leading medical coding systems communities it was an exciting time this is

127
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:58,560
a quote from Gary so foundation models he says are more like parlor tricks than genuine intelligence

128
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:05,120
unfortunately the the problems in medicine don't even yield the parlor tricks they're not interesting

129
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:12,160
errors they're just errors of a very messy sort now let's look at snow med ct which John already

130
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,160
mentioned and he mentioned Roger Cotay I will mention a story about Roger Cotay which I'm not

131
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,480
sure is true but certainly there's some truth to it Cotay visited the Vatican he wanted to present

132
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:32,080
the six volumes of snow med ct to the pope and so he was chatting with the pope and the pope was

133
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:38,960
looking at six volumes and then the pope raised his head and he said are you aware that this spells

134
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:45,600
demons backwards now whether that is a true story or not uh no one will ever know so this is a little

135
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:53,280
piece of snow med showing how it changed from 2016 to 2017 it's a very very trivial example but it

136
00:15:53,280 --> 00:16:01,440
will show you how you get bloat so this is the opposite of silos bloat is when you get inconsistent

137
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:10,560
data because there isn't a silo in 2016 a test kit is classified as a substance which may or may

138
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:18,880
not be good in 2017 is classified as a physical object which also may or may not be good but the

139
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:26,320
fact that you have both of those classifications in your system is going to mean that data about

140
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:33,040
test kit which was entered into the record in 2016 will conflict with data about test kits

141
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:43,520
entered in 2017 and that's not good if it happens all the time now here we have 2015 2016 we see

142
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:52,960
that there is on the left a joint finding and disorder of musculoskeletal system these are both

143
00:16:52,960 --> 00:17:00,720
parents of orthopathy which is a disorder now a disorder is something on the side of the patient

144
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,640
it's a broken leg or it's a disease a finding is something on the side of a physician it's what the

145
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,280
physician finds or discovers in the world one of the same thing should not be both on the side of

146
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:21,360
the patient and on the side of the clinician it's a very basic error snow med is full of that error

147
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,280
there are so many different ways in which that error is made in snow med that snow med generates

148
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:36,960
bloat and now this is just one term in snow med and two versions 2002 and 2010 so the term is

149
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,480
excision biopsy of vulval lesion this term is chosen at random you would get similar bloats

150
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:54,720
from the many terms so every single track through this monster can be found if you join snow med 2002

151
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,440
with so 2010 and the clinical coders are coding at different levels within this monster they're

152
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:09,200
putting down data about one and the same medical phenomenon namely the process of biopsy from a

153
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,560
vulval lesion and they're each coding that with a different code for how it looks is this so this

154
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,320
is just this is from that diagram i've just zoomed a little bit procedure characterized by action

155
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,760
status is a navigational concept in snow med that means it tells you how you got that concept or

156
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,160
something and then you have procedure carried out on subject which is what snow med calls a

157
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,480
situation we're also told that it's a procedure carried out which is another situation but at

158
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:45,680
the same time it's a procedure on a body system which is a procedure so we have four ontologically

159
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:52,080
different things namely navigational concept situations and procedures applied to one and the

160
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,880
same medical phenomenon and the reason is that snow med's top level is incoherent now it's

161
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,640
incoherent has been recognized for some years by what we might call the intellectual leaders of

162
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:12,720
the snow med community and each year they propose to the general snow med management assembly that

163
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:20,960
they should drop the snow med top level and re-architect snow med using bfo there is now reason

164
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:29,120
to be optimistic that they will finally achieve a majority vote bfo does not allow that kind of

165
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,440
forking it doesn't allow four different terms at the very high ontological level to be applied to

166
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:43,120
one and the same item it's built on good ontological principles and it's much simpler to use than the

167
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,720
snow med top level and it makes clear distinctions between things like entities on the side of the

168
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:57,520
patient and entities on the side of the clinician so how do we get a useful space medicine ontology

169
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:04,640
well nasa has a chief information officer and they have a an information system which is an

170
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,040
information system covering all of the astronauts who ever existed in in the west and all the families

171
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:17,920
of all the astronauts it's very high level it uses unfortunately multiple coding systems but all of

172
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:24,560
the coding systems could in principle be unified and focused on a revised version of snow med which

173
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:31,280
is what the nasa cio should be calling for a revised version with a proper top level it should

174
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,960
eliminate the errors basically where they are easily identifiable and it's here i think that ai

175
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,440
could play a role because we already have a large amount of data which is relevant to space missions

176
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,400
because the astronauts are involved it's maintained and curated by top level clinicians and it's

177
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:58,800
accessible already it just needs to be filtered to remove inconsistencies and well i just conclude so

178
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,800
would therefore be useful for space medicine as john explained it would be useful for everyone else

179
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,800
because it would serve as a kind of ground truth the equivalent of a foundation model but one which

180
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,920
would have been well built and i won't try and talk about deep mind i will i will stop

181
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,040
and i hope you're all still there
