WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
I assume that everyone in the room knows something about BFO.

00:06.400 --> 00:13.020
What I'm going to do now is provide a basic introduction to the contents of BFO, a basic

00:13.020 --> 00:20.540
introduction to how it's being used and by whom and why, a basic introduction to what's

00:20.540 --> 00:27.980
happening in Washington DC as we speak almost, to make BFO what we hope will be something

00:27.980 --> 00:33.780
like the government ontology or rather the top level of the government ontology and by

00:33.780 --> 00:38.620
that I do not mean that the only government is the one that's in Washington DC.

00:38.620 --> 00:45.860
BFO is used by many groups and when people start building an ontology for a specific

00:45.860 --> 00:52.580
purpose they very often examine different top level ontologies.

00:53.180 --> 01:02.700
BFO is just one of a small number and some of them then say that they reject using BFO

01:02.700 --> 01:08.940
because it does X and if you check you will find that usually it doesn't do X, in other

01:08.940 --> 01:14.780
words they misunderstood something in BFO and thought they had a reason for not using

01:14.780 --> 01:15.780
it.

01:15.900 --> 01:24.020
Now one reason that people give for not using BFO is that BFO is a realist ontology and

01:24.020 --> 01:28.540
I'm going to explain what that means and why some people think that that's a bad thing

01:28.540 --> 01:33.380
and that they're not mistaken and there are reasons why a realist ontology might be a

01:33.380 --> 01:34.380
bad thing.

01:34.380 --> 01:42.780
Then I'll go over why people think they need ontologies and specifically top level ontologies.

01:42.780 --> 01:51.420
I'll give some examples of successes and failures and I'll try and give a sufficient survey

01:51.420 --> 01:55.540
that you will all go away feeling that you've learned something.

01:55.540 --> 02:01.780
Alright so what does it mean that an ontology is a realist ontology?

02:01.780 --> 02:07.460
So I need to start by saying that when we say BFO is a top level ontology what that

02:07.500 --> 02:12.900
means is that it can be applied to any domain whatsoever.

02:12.900 --> 02:20.220
Now in creating the ISO standard we had to specify what that might mean, can be applied

02:20.220 --> 02:22.340
to any domain whatsoever.

02:22.340 --> 02:27.860
If we have time today you will see that there are domains which BFO cannot be applied to

02:27.860 --> 02:35.580
and I'll give you a clue, it begins with the letter Q and it's part of physics, that we

02:36.020 --> 02:39.700
have three seconds to work out that.

02:39.700 --> 02:45.580
So BFO is not entirely the main neutral, I think now I would say that it's the main neutral

02:45.580 --> 02:53.380
for all areas of common sense and all areas of classical physics and all areas where we

02:53.380 --> 03:02.780
collect empirical data and we'll leave Q to one side for the moment.

03:02.780 --> 03:15.900
Now secondly we need to mention the requirement that BFO is realist in the sense that BFO requires

03:15.900 --> 03:22.180
that all the classes in BFO have instances.

03:22.180 --> 03:30.420
So we have the class object and I am an instance of the class object and I exist in space and

03:30.420 --> 03:31.420
time.

03:31.420 --> 03:36.860
Now I will explain why some people might think that we do not want to insist that all classes

03:36.860 --> 03:39.460
have instances.

03:39.460 --> 03:47.340
Now so BFO as all the classes have instances, we're not now talking about classes like protein

03:47.340 --> 03:53.460
or person or planet, we're talking about classes like generically dependent continuum which

03:53.460 --> 03:55.740
we'll come back to later on.

03:55.740 --> 03:59.140
All BFO classes have instances.

03:59.180 --> 04:06.900
Now people use BFO as a domain neutral ontology because it provides a good starting point

04:06.900 --> 04:12.420
we think for making domain specific ontologies.

04:12.420 --> 04:20.140
So if we take the cell ontology, the cell ontology is all about cells and all cells are objects

04:20.140 --> 04:23.260
in the BFO sense of object.

04:23.260 --> 04:30.220
And so all cells in the entire universe and in the entire history of the entire universe

04:30.220 --> 04:35.300
are instances of the BFO class object.

04:35.300 --> 04:41.260
Now a realist ontology is only interested in classes which have instances and when I

04:41.260 --> 04:51.780
say have I might mean or have and I'm not going to say anything about the future.

04:51.780 --> 04:54.900
We can worry about that later.

04:54.900 --> 04:59.620
All right now we have evidence that cells exist.

04:59.620 --> 05:04.420
We have evidence that instances of the class cell exist and therefore we have evidence

05:04.420 --> 05:08.380
that instances of the BFO class object exist.

05:08.380 --> 05:13.940
They all exist in space and time and we know this because that's what established science

05:13.940 --> 05:20.060
says and we want BFO ontologies to be consistent with established science.

05:20.060 --> 05:28.340
Some people I'm not in France now and so I won't mention French philosophers but some

05:28.340 --> 05:32.820
people think that it's actually not a good criterion or something that it should be

05:32.820 --> 05:35.140
conformant to established science.

05:35.140 --> 05:40.900
I did say I wouldn't mention French philosophers so I won't.

05:40.900 --> 05:48.540
Now but there are for different reasons BFO conformant domain ontologies which do not

05:48.580 --> 05:54.100
satisfy the principle that all classes have to be instantiated by instances in space and

05:54.100 --> 05:55.620
time.

05:55.620 --> 06:02.260
For instance you might be building an ontology for military planning which is all about the

06:02.260 --> 06:11.980
future and future things might never exist so some plans are realized that entities

06:11.980 --> 06:17.260
inscribed by those plans and by the corresponding plan ontologies then exist but many plans

06:17.340 --> 06:23.380
are not realized and you want a planning ontology to work independently of whether the plans

06:23.380 --> 06:30.300
that you use the ontology to describe or represent or define are actually realized.

06:30.300 --> 06:36.780
So planning is a good example where the realist ontology approach in the narrow sense does

06:36.780 --> 06:39.500
not work.

06:39.500 --> 06:46.420
Another example and so some people like to build ontologies of fiction or myth.

06:46.420 --> 06:55.220
I don't want to talk about those frequently but there are chemists who try to synthesize

06:55.220 --> 07:02.900
molecule which never gets synthesized and so a good chemistry ontology probably would

07:02.900 --> 07:08.500
have to include classes which have no instances either in the past or in the present or in

07:08.500 --> 07:18.500
the future because there are quite conceivably molecule diagrams which are chemically legal

07:18.500 --> 07:25.580
but which are never actually synthesized because they're not synthesizable.

07:25.580 --> 07:31.700
But in fact this fact is not a problem for BFO.

07:31.700 --> 07:37.740
So BFO encourages people to build BFO conformant domain ontologies which satisfy the instantiation

07:37.740 --> 07:45.980
principle but people can build other ontologies and they would still be conformant with BFO.

07:45.980 --> 07:53.660
Realism is a kind of metaphysical slogan.

07:53.660 --> 07:57.100
I think it's a very useful slogan when you're building ontologies.

07:57.100 --> 08:01.540
You don't want to build ontologies which are not in the real world but if you have to build

08:01.540 --> 08:08.380
ontologies for unsynthesized molecules you can still use BFO and it works perfectly well.

08:08.380 --> 08:14.060
And in fact we have now methods which we've developed to help people who are working in

08:14.060 --> 08:19.100
areas where for instance plans are not realized.

08:19.100 --> 08:25.940
Just for those people who want to follow up on this, this goes under the heading of the

08:25.940 --> 08:30.860
modal relation ontologies.

08:30.860 --> 08:38.420
The modal relation ontology is an extension of BFO which works while working with things

08:38.420 --> 08:46.700
like plans and other kinds of application domains where instantiation is not universal.

08:46.700 --> 08:51.660
All right this is BFO, it's quite small.

08:51.660 --> 08:55.940
I'm not going to go through every single piece of it.

08:55.940 --> 09:04.020
What we have here is what we call the backbone taxonomy of BFO, in other words it is a hierarchy.

09:04.020 --> 09:10.620
Now there are other relations in BFO which are lateral, so these are vertical relations,

09:10.620 --> 09:12.820
they go from the bottom to the top.

09:12.820 --> 09:17.660
So every Fiat surface is a continuous Fiat boundary.

09:17.660 --> 09:21.140
I'll explain some of what that means in a minute.

09:21.140 --> 09:26.540
That is our relation takes you from the bottom of BFO all the way to the very top because

09:26.540 --> 09:33.260
everything, every class in BFO is a subclass of the class entity.

09:33.260 --> 09:40.260
Now but there are relations such as is part of which does not go from bottom to top, it

09:40.260 --> 09:45.460
goes from one side to the other and there are other lateral relations like that.

09:45.460 --> 09:55.460
And an ontology in our view is a backbone taxonomy plus lateral relations.

09:55.460 --> 10:02.220
The taxonomy is ISA and then you have maybe many lateral relations, sometimes called object

10:02.220 --> 10:08.900
properties which connect the classes together in different ways.

10:08.900 --> 10:16.340
So I'll just give you examples, immaterial entity in BFO is a subclass of independent

10:16.340 --> 10:22.860
continuum, a continuum is something which exists through time and independent continuum

10:22.860 --> 10:29.180
is something which does not require a bearer in which it inheres.

10:29.180 --> 10:36.020
Qualities for instance require bearers, so the redness of your cheek can only exist if

10:36.020 --> 10:37.020
you exist.

10:37.020 --> 10:43.020
You are an independent continuum, the redness is a dependent continuum, the redness of your

10:43.020 --> 10:53.940
cheek is an instance of the kind of redness which is a subkind of the BFO kind quality.

10:53.940 --> 11:04.740
Alright so immaterial entities for BFO include boundaries are not made in matter, spatial

11:04.740 --> 11:09.380
regions are also not made in matter and sites.

11:09.380 --> 11:17.060
And for the sake of saving time I would just say that holes with an H are the principal

11:17.060 --> 11:18.380
examples of sites.

11:18.380 --> 11:26.980
So the interior of my mouth, the interior of this room are both examples of sites.

11:26.980 --> 11:35.540
And now I'll take one more example, realizable entity, a quality is not realizable, if you

11:35.540 --> 11:39.460
have a red cheek you just have a red cheek and that's it.

11:39.460 --> 11:46.300
But a potential, a disposition or a function are realizable.

11:46.300 --> 11:58.140
So if the function of my iPhone is to send and receive telephone messages, that function

11:58.140 --> 12:03.620
is realized occasionally, but it's not always realized.

12:03.620 --> 12:07.500
And so for some of the time it's just realizable.

12:07.500 --> 12:13.940
And I'll be talking more about realisables in the course of the rest of this presentation.

12:13.940 --> 12:17.700
And then I'll say something about fiat object parts.

12:17.700 --> 12:23.620
So my arm is a part of me.

12:23.620 --> 12:30.860
But it's not an object, it's a fiat part because the line or the plane between my arm and the

12:30.860 --> 12:37.660
rest of me is a matter of our fiat, in other words our decision.

12:37.660 --> 12:48.340
So fiat parts are parts which reflect decisions, that's somewhat simplified, but you can illustrate

12:48.340 --> 12:59.420
it by saying that everything to the left of this boundary here is the smoking zone, kind

12:59.420 --> 13:00.980
of cockles coming to you.

13:00.980 --> 13:09.180
And then on the right of this line is the non-smoking zone, so that's a fiat boundary.

13:09.180 --> 13:17.940
Now the boundary between Poland and Germany is also a fiat boundary.

13:17.940 --> 13:27.900
All right, so now ontology was used by philosophers, so they tell me, for a long time, starting

13:27.900 --> 13:38.180
in about 1652 in Germany as a Latin translation of, or a Latin word to correspond to the Greek

13:38.180 --> 13:41.060
word metaphysics.

13:41.060 --> 13:51.540
In around 1970 it started to be used by AI and robotics scientists, primarily in Stanford.

13:51.540 --> 13:57.580
And basically they thought that the way to train a robot to behave like a human being

13:57.780 --> 14:07.380
would be to describe human common sense using first order logic and then feed the first order

14:07.380 --> 14:11.500
logic description of human common sense into the robot and then the robot would be able

14:11.500 --> 14:14.420
to mimic human behavior.

14:14.420 --> 14:21.420
And the behavior that they used as their prime example was buying, sorry, not buying salad.

14:21.420 --> 14:26.220
Yeah, buying salad from a salad bar, this was the era of salad bars.

14:26.220 --> 14:33.740
And so the robot would have to know how to pick up tomatoes using plastic implements

14:33.740 --> 14:37.380
without squashing the tomato too much.

14:37.380 --> 14:42.540
And it would have to learn that you can knock into a chair and you don't need to apologize

14:42.540 --> 14:46.900
to the chair, but if you knock into a human being, you do need to apologize.

14:46.900 --> 14:50.740
Those were the things that the robot had to learn.

14:50.740 --> 14:59.820
The formal, the first order logic, formal representation of human common sense was called an ontology.

14:59.820 --> 15:03.420
Sometimes it was called a folk ontology.

15:03.420 --> 15:08.460
And the word ontology, they almost certainly took over from Quine.

15:08.460 --> 15:14.100
So those of you who know some philosophy who are in the room will know that Quine had a very special

15:14.100 --> 15:24.580
approach to ontology, which was, it led to the coinage of this word, folk ontology.

15:24.580 --> 15:32.660
And then the next step was the fact that you have different groups building ontologies

15:32.660 --> 15:35.620
and they needed to be able to compare them.

15:35.620 --> 15:41.060
And so they invented something called knowledge interchange format.

15:41.060 --> 15:50.860
And by a long, long set of stages, the knowledge interchange format eventually became what we now call OWL.

15:50.860 --> 16:00.980
All right, now a famous man in all of this, another Stanford man from this group who is still alive and still selling his thing.

16:00.980 --> 16:09.540
It was Doug Lennett who created a big database called Psyche, which is short for encyclopedia.

16:09.540 --> 16:13.820
He now sometimes calls Psyche an ontology.

16:13.820 --> 16:27.380
And it's full of folk knowledge, such as Albany is the capital of New York State and other such pieces of knowledge.

16:27.380 --> 16:34.900
And as I say, he now calls it an ontology and it's sometimes regarded as being a successful, very large ontology.

16:34.900 --> 16:38.980
It's, BFO is a very small ontology.

16:39.020 --> 16:41.220
We don't try and describe everything.

16:41.220 --> 16:47.220
He is basically trying to describe everything, including the virgin birth.

16:47.220 --> 16:56.540
There are facts, not the facts, but the virgin birth is an object which is described at some length in the axioms of Psyche.

16:56.540 --> 17:01.620
One big problem with Psyche is that the axioms are not consistent.

17:01.620 --> 17:08.060
And Doug Lennett says that's exactly as it should be because common sense is not consistent.

17:08.140 --> 17:11.140
Now, BFO is consistently proved, isn't it?

17:12.900 --> 17:14.900
All right, come back to that later.

17:14.900 --> 17:25.100
So the first really interesting contribution to all of this was by Patrick Hayes in his naive physics manifesto,

17:25.100 --> 17:35.380
which described the methodology of robotics that I just hinted at, but he described it in a formal theoretical way.

17:35.380 --> 17:44.420
And I believe that it was Patrick Hayes' naive physics manifesto and accompanied by a paper called Ontology of Liquids,

17:44.420 --> 17:48.500
which is the true origin of modern day ontology.

17:49.940 --> 17:53.100
And they're still really interesting pieces.

17:53.100 --> 17:56.340
And then we get knowledge interchange format.

17:56.340 --> 18:01.220
Tom Gruber was an important person in the knowledge interchange format world.

18:01.220 --> 18:06.620
And he, he, it was the begetter of Ciri.

18:06.620 --> 18:10.220
So you all have, Ciri is an ontology app.

18:10.220 --> 18:15.940
So you all have ontologies in your pockets, like it or not.

18:15.940 --> 18:18.540
And this is what an ontology in Ciri might look like.

18:18.540 --> 18:24.340
So you have universal for things like real event or movie event.

18:24.340 --> 18:33.140
And then you have instances of things like cities where you might see movies or eat meals.

18:33.140 --> 18:39.820
And this is, this is what I was talking about when I said that all classes in BFO have instances.

18:39.820 --> 18:45.340
The ancient instances are the particulars, the city's particulars, zip codes and so on.

18:45.340 --> 18:55.180
The classes are the universals, which are in the top of the diagram here.

18:55.180 --> 19:01.380
All right, now the knowledge information format is being made more and more mature.

19:01.380 --> 19:10.420
And Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues in 1994 introduced the idea of the semantic web.

19:10.420 --> 19:20.540
The idea was that now that we have a somewhat coherent version of owl, the web ontology language,

19:20.540 --> 19:25.860
which is a kind of formalized version of HTML.

19:25.860 --> 19:29.460
It's a long, long gap between HTML and owl.

19:29.460 --> 19:36.780
But by 1994, we have something which can serve as the basis for a new kind of web, a semantic web.

19:36.780 --> 19:44.300
And it's semantic because it's described using a formal language with a semantics in the classical model, model theoretic sense.

19:44.300 --> 19:48.300
And it would be nice if we had a semantic web, wouldn't it?

19:48.300 --> 19:53.580
Said the people in the paper in Scientific American in 1994.

19:53.580 --> 19:58.100
And I agree, it would be nice, but we don't have anything like it.

19:58.100 --> 20:02.220
We have a lot of things going on under the heading of semantic web.

20:02.220 --> 20:05.340
Too many things going on under the heading of semantic web.

20:05.380 --> 20:07.500
And some of it is good.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.380
And then we have the resource description framework.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.820
Then we have protege.

20:12.820 --> 20:19.540
And then we have the first real version of owl in 2004.

20:19.540 --> 20:22.940
And then we have the whoosh of linked open data.

20:22.940 --> 20:29.020
And nowadays we have knowledge graphs, some of which is really good.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.020
All right, now, but they all failed.

20:31.020 --> 20:36.100
All of those ontologies are built, including psych, if you look at it.

20:36.100 --> 20:40.500
They all failed.

20:40.500 --> 20:44.460
So most semantic web ontologies fail.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.580
And it's hard to think of ones that succeed.

20:46.580 --> 20:49.180
And there are lots of reasons why they fail.

20:49.180 --> 20:53.260
One reason is it's easy to build the damn things.

20:53.260 --> 20:54.940
And so everybody wants to build one.

20:54.940 --> 20:57.380
And so everybody has their own ontology.

20:57.420 --> 21:02.700
And then people say, oh, ontology, no, they're brittle.

21:02.700 --> 21:09.060
You use them once, and then you drop them, because they're obviously useless.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.220
And so there are many reasons why they fail.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.460
There were bad languages out there.

21:16.460 --> 21:18.020
I mean, really bad languages.

21:20.740 --> 21:25.260
And they didn't understand what definitions were.

21:25.260 --> 21:29.220
And people today don't understand what definitions are.

21:29.220 --> 21:32.540
And the ontologies were of poor quality.

21:32.540 --> 21:35.100
There was no documentation.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.420
All the links are broken.

21:37.420 --> 21:39.980
Dolce is not bad.

21:39.980 --> 21:42.420
I'm not including Dolce under this heading.

21:42.420 --> 21:44.980
It's bad under other headings, but then so is BFO.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.580
So they're all bad.

21:49.580 --> 21:52.100
And this was ontology winter.

21:52.100 --> 21:57.540
And I know that we are now, and thanks to this gentleman here,

21:57.540 --> 22:00.700
we're in ontology high summer.

22:00.700 --> 22:03.540
But there will be another winter.

22:03.540 --> 22:04.580
He won't live forever.

22:07.740 --> 22:08.660
All right, now.

22:08.660 --> 22:12.300
So now I come into the picture.

22:12.300 --> 22:13.420
Is he my throat?

22:13.420 --> 22:17.540
It's got almost better.

22:17.540 --> 22:21.820
In the 1990s, we had the Human Genome Project.

22:21.860 --> 22:25.460
Now, the Human Genome Project was many projects.

22:25.460 --> 22:28.860
And there were many institutions across the planet

22:28.860 --> 22:35.740
who were collecting genomic and proteomic and toxicogenomics

22:35.740 --> 22:38.060
and so on data.

22:38.060 --> 22:41.900
And they were creating registries for these data.

22:41.900 --> 22:46.300
And there was panic because every country

22:46.300 --> 22:48.940
had its own collection of registries.

22:48.940 --> 22:51.060
And even within a single country,

22:51.060 --> 22:52.900
the registries would not be collected

22:52.900 --> 22:56.220
and described in a consistent way.

22:56.220 --> 23:01.020
And this was going to correct all the goals

23:01.020 --> 23:03.780
of the Human Genome Project because it

23:03.780 --> 23:08.740
meant that we really didn't have a consistent representation

23:08.740 --> 23:12.540
of all the different human and fly and so on genomes

23:12.540 --> 23:15.140
and all the proteomes and so on.

23:15.780 --> 23:24.820
And so a group of four biologists, all of them

23:24.820 --> 23:30.420
high up in the genome project world,

23:30.420 --> 23:33.700
one of them was a fly person, one of them

23:33.700 --> 23:36.580
was a mouse person, one of them was a fish person,

23:36.580 --> 23:40.180
and the other was a person person.

23:40.180 --> 23:44.260
And this was in, I believe it was in Montreal.

23:44.300 --> 23:48.900
It was either in Montreal or in Melbourne, I forget.

23:48.900 --> 23:49.740
They're in a pub.

23:51.940 --> 23:55.420
The fly person, Michael Ashburner,

23:55.420 --> 23:59.340
who is my hero in every possible way,

23:59.340 --> 24:02.020
and he's still alive, but he's very sick.

24:02.020 --> 24:05.860
Michael Ashburner was basically the head of the fly genome.

24:05.860 --> 24:09.620
And he wrote down on the back of a cigarette

24:09.620 --> 24:13.700
packet with a heavy smoker, which is relevant still

24:13.740 --> 24:17.220
because he is still alive, but only just.

24:17.220 --> 24:23.660
He wrote down a list of gene functions.

24:23.660 --> 24:28.740
For instance, cell division might be on the list.

24:28.740 --> 24:31.780
And he said, this list is going to serve as the basis

24:31.780 --> 24:36.700
for creating order in all of these registers.

24:36.700 --> 24:39.060
They're all going to use these words to describe gene

24:39.060 --> 24:39.940
function.

24:39.980 --> 24:43.100
Now there are, I don't know, 13,000 items

24:43.100 --> 24:46.500
on the list of gene functions, or molecular functions

24:46.500 --> 24:47.740
they're called.

24:47.740 --> 24:50.140
And then there are other items on two other lists

24:50.140 --> 24:57.580
for biological processes and for cellular constituents.

24:57.580 --> 25:01.900
So that list on the back of that cigarette packet

25:01.900 --> 25:04.100
became the gene ontology.

25:04.100 --> 25:08.260
And the gene ontology has gone from strength to strength

25:08.260 --> 25:10.180
ever since.

25:10.180 --> 25:14.660
Upwards of $3 billion have been spent on the gene ontology,

25:14.660 --> 25:18.460
not on building the ontology, but on using it

25:18.460 --> 25:20.860
to regiment all the data.

25:20.860 --> 25:23.660
All the data in biology, practically speaking,

25:23.660 --> 25:28.540
gets touched somehow by the gene ontology.

25:28.540 --> 25:30.660
All right, so this was the first success

25:30.660 --> 25:31.860
in the ontology world.

25:32.780 --> 25:38.740
And then because of this success, and because of,

25:38.740 --> 25:42.580
well, no, Propagate actually was not causing problems

25:42.580 --> 25:43.340
at this stage.

25:43.340 --> 25:47.460
They had their own language for building ontologies,

25:47.460 --> 25:49.780
which was a simple database language.

25:49.780 --> 25:51.460
And I've forgotten what it's called.

25:51.460 --> 25:53.940
Can anyone remind me?

25:53.940 --> 25:55.460
Anyway, they have their own language.

25:55.460 --> 25:56.580
They use OWL now.

25:59.980 --> 26:01.740
So they were building ontologies.

26:01.780 --> 26:03.180
So we have the gene ontology.

26:03.180 --> 26:03.860
It's really good.

26:03.860 --> 26:05.460
Now we need an anatomy ontology.

26:05.460 --> 26:07.300
We need a fly anatomy ontology.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.180
And we need a protein ontology.

26:09.180 --> 26:10.780
We need a gene sequence ontology.

26:10.780 --> 26:11.700
And they were right.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.300
We didn't need all of those things.

26:13.300 --> 26:14.940
So they started to build them.

26:14.940 --> 26:18.860
But now they started to slip back into the old,

26:18.860 --> 26:20.900
oh, I downloaded Propagate.

26:20.900 --> 26:23.460
Now I can build an ontology, and then they built crap.

26:24.060 --> 26:31.700
In 2002, I received a prize from the German government,

26:31.700 --> 26:39.580
a lot of money, to found an institute for medical ontology.

26:39.580 --> 26:43.180
I did not know anything about medicine.

26:43.180 --> 26:46.540
I did not know anything about biology.

26:46.540 --> 26:50.900
Somebody approached me very early on in my institute.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.220
I had an institute in Leipzig.

26:53.220 --> 26:59.180
And they said, what do you think is the gene ontology?

26:59.180 --> 27:02.420
And I had never heard of the gene ontology.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.380
And I looked at it.

27:05.380 --> 27:09.100
And within 15 seconds, I realized three things.

27:09.100 --> 27:12.140
Not all of which turned out to be true.

27:12.140 --> 27:14.300
First thing was, within five seconds,

27:14.300 --> 27:18.540
I realized that I would spend the rest of my life working

27:18.700 --> 27:20.060
on the gene ontology.

27:20.060 --> 27:22.460
But that isn't true, this is.

27:22.460 --> 27:25.860
But that came into my head immediately.

27:25.860 --> 27:27.660
The second thing which came into my head

27:27.660 --> 27:30.020
was the gene ontology is exactly what we need.

27:30.020 --> 27:34.780
This is what my new institute should be based on.

27:34.780 --> 27:36.140
And that came true.

27:36.140 --> 27:44.820
And then the third thing that I realized is that it's crap.

27:45.820 --> 27:51.340
And it's crap because it's full of logical mistakes.

27:51.340 --> 27:54.140
And I could talk for two hours just

27:54.140 --> 27:58.140
listing the logical mistakes that they were making.

27:58.140 --> 28:00.060
And so I had money.

28:00.060 --> 28:04.300
I invited the leadership of the gene ontology to Leipzig.

28:04.300 --> 28:07.500
They already knew about me.

28:07.500 --> 28:10.860
I think I published a short paper on problems

28:10.860 --> 28:12.260
with the gene ontology.

28:12.260 --> 28:16.140
And they wanted to come and see what I was doing.

28:16.140 --> 28:20.860
So they came and we had a workshop,

28:20.860 --> 28:24.340
which was historically interesting for reasons

28:24.340 --> 28:27.260
having to do with 2001.

28:27.260 --> 28:32.700
And I presented a talk at this meeting.

28:32.700 --> 28:37.860
So the gene ontology is called the GO, G-O.

28:37.860 --> 28:42.140
And so my talk was called STOP, which

28:42.180 --> 28:46.900
is short for smart terminology through ontological principles.

28:46.900 --> 28:49.740
And I just went through all the mistakes

28:49.740 --> 28:52.700
in the logic of the gene ontology.

28:52.700 --> 28:57.700
And after this talk, Michael Ashburner

28:57.700 --> 29:02.100
went, took me behind the curtain.

29:02.100 --> 29:06.820
And he said, Barry, I will do a deal with you.

29:06.820 --> 29:11.260
I will put you in charge of the logic of the gene ontology.

29:11.300 --> 29:13.300
And in return, you will promise never

29:13.300 --> 29:18.580
to criticize the gene ontology in public.

29:18.580 --> 29:21.180
And I did the deal.

29:21.180 --> 29:23.540
I sold my soul.

29:23.540 --> 29:27.140
And you have just decided to follow up.

29:27.140 --> 29:31.460
Oh, well, now that was moved to a new millennium question.

29:31.460 --> 29:34.740
Now, I'm only criticizing as it was then.

29:34.740 --> 29:38.660
So I think that the gene ontology community will admit

29:38.660 --> 29:41.460
that I did clean up the gene ontology

29:41.460 --> 29:45.460
from a logical point of view and that that was useful.

29:45.460 --> 29:48.180
But in cleaning up the gene ontology,

29:48.180 --> 29:53.300
I ended up cleaning up also some of the other ontologies

29:53.300 --> 29:57.460
to make them fit the gene ontology in a proper logical way.

29:57.460 --> 30:03.340
And that is the oboe foundry, the open biological and biomedical

30:03.340 --> 30:04.500
ontology's foundry.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.700
It's a collection of ontologies which

30:06.700 --> 30:09.940
have been cleaned up logically so that they fit together.

30:09.940 --> 30:15.940
And Michael wanted to call it the oboe smithing.

30:15.940 --> 30:19.700
But I put my foot down on that.

30:19.700 --> 30:22.420
And so we came to the idea of calling it the oboe foundry.

30:22.420 --> 30:27.740
The idea is that to build these foundries is really hard work.

30:27.740 --> 30:29.460
And it's hard work in the sense that you

30:29.460 --> 30:33.420
have to ban things and people with hammers and things.

30:33.420 --> 30:34.780
All right, so how do we do it?

30:34.780 --> 30:36.260
How do we link them all together?

30:36.260 --> 30:39.740
The answer is BFO.

30:39.740 --> 30:43.860
So this is the original picture of the foundry.

30:43.860 --> 30:47.900
The gene ontology is the yellow part.

30:47.900 --> 30:50.860
And at the very top, we have the core of BFO.

30:50.860 --> 30:54.260
We have independent continuance such as molecules and cells

30:54.260 --> 30:57.860
and organism, dependent continuance such as qualities

30:57.860 --> 31:01.780
and function, and occurrence, processes, which

31:01.780 --> 31:05.820
corresponds exactly to the three parts of the gene ontology

31:05.860 --> 31:07.980
biological processes, molecular functions,

31:07.980 --> 31:09.460
and cellular development.

31:09.460 --> 31:13.980
BFO is a reverse engineering of the genome's policy

31:13.980 --> 31:17.500
to apply to everything, apart from things

31:17.500 --> 31:27.140
beginning with Q. And so BFO grew in the course of creating

31:27.140 --> 31:28.740
the oboe foundry.

31:28.740 --> 31:30.620
And there are now, it's gone up.

31:30.620 --> 31:35.300
It's probably about 490 ontologies

31:35.340 --> 31:36.780
which are using BFO.

31:36.780 --> 31:40.060
And you can find there's a list of users of BFO, which

31:40.060 --> 31:42.900
we update periodically.

31:42.900 --> 31:46.380
And not all of these ontologies are any good.

31:46.380 --> 31:48.820
I wouldn't say that most of them are not very good,

31:48.820 --> 31:52.220
but some of them are very good.

31:52.220 --> 31:56.420
And the fact they use BFO helps, even

31:56.420 --> 31:58.740
if they don't always use it correctly,

31:58.740 --> 32:00.980
because at least they're trying to do something which

32:00.980 --> 32:05.020
would be interoperable with other ontologies using BFO.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.740
And they're also drawing on the talent

32:06.740 --> 32:11.580
of people who have experienced building ontologies using BFO.

32:11.580 --> 32:15.860
Now, in the beginning, which is to say, until about four

32:15.860 --> 32:19.060
or five years ago, that all of these ontologies

32:19.060 --> 32:23.700
practically speaking were biology or biomedicine

32:23.700 --> 32:26.740
or something like that.

32:26.780 --> 32:36.740
So now we have more foundries.

32:36.740 --> 32:40.660
And not all of them have anything to do with biology.

32:40.660 --> 32:43.340
And I'm going to be talking about the foundry

32:43.340 --> 32:46.460
at the bottom, the diode foundry,

32:46.460 --> 32:48.740
towards the end of this presentation.

32:48.740 --> 32:54.340
So now we have more ontologies built using the BFO principles

32:54.340 --> 32:57.180
and following the idea that you have to build ontologies

32:57.180 --> 33:02.780
so that they work logically together in at least all

33:02.780 --> 33:03.460
of these areas.

33:03.460 --> 33:06.940
In fact, there are some more, which I will also talk about.

33:06.940 --> 33:09.580
Now, one of them is called the common core ontologies, which

33:09.580 --> 33:13.900
you can think of as a set of mid-level ontologies

33:13.900 --> 33:17.580
for things like artifacts, events, relations, units

33:17.580 --> 33:18.380
of measure.

33:18.380 --> 33:22.180
And then we have many, many domain ontologies, many of which

33:22.180 --> 33:26.380
have been funded by one or other military project, which

33:26.380 --> 33:29.260
have been defined within the framework of the common core

33:29.260 --> 33:36.980
mid-level ontology for various sorts of military applications

33:36.980 --> 33:40.500
and intelligence community applications.

33:40.500 --> 33:45.540
And now my view of what BFO is doing in all of this

33:45.540 --> 33:51.340
gets more, I hope, more sophisticated as time goes by.

33:51.380 --> 33:56.380
Now I like to compare BFO to the QWERTY keyboard.

33:56.380 --> 33:57.900
It's a standard.

33:57.900 --> 34:00.740
Lots of people like to use this standard.

34:00.740 --> 34:03.180
They become skilled at using this standard.

34:03.180 --> 34:05.100
And so you can't change it very easily

34:05.100 --> 34:09.940
because you get very bad reactions from existing users.

34:09.940 --> 34:14.620
It's not necessarily the best ontology or the best top-level

34:14.620 --> 34:18.700
ontology, but it's certainly the most often used

34:18.740 --> 34:19.940
top-level ontology.

34:22.380 --> 34:27.900
And I think that it's a good idea to think of ontology

34:27.900 --> 34:33.380
as being, in part, not an attempt to describe what is,

34:33.380 --> 34:39.740
but an attempt to legislate about how we will describe what is.

34:39.740 --> 34:42.380
And I'm not sure whether that's helpful,

34:42.380 --> 34:44.860
just stated in this form.

34:44.860 --> 34:47.020
But I know from my own experience

34:47.060 --> 34:49.180
that very often when I'm arguing with people

34:49.180 --> 34:53.180
in the course of building ontologies collectively,

34:53.180 --> 34:56.700
that I repeatedly reach the point where I say,

34:56.700 --> 34:59.460
here we just legislate.

34:59.460 --> 35:01.980
It's like driving on the left.

35:01.980 --> 35:05.180
It's obviously, it's not obviously the right side

35:05.180 --> 35:08.780
of the road to drive, but you need to make a choice.

35:08.780 --> 35:12.380
And that choice is a matter of legislation

35:12.380 --> 35:15.140
and that kind of choice is very often necessary

35:15.180 --> 35:17.220
when building ontology.

35:17.220 --> 35:21.980
All right, so the ISO standard will exist pretty soon

35:21.980 --> 35:26.980
in four parts, part one and part two already exist.

35:27.340 --> 35:31.540
As you can see down there, you spend 118 francs.

35:31.540 --> 35:33.620
You can get a PDF copy.

35:33.620 --> 35:36.060
That's about 18 pages long.

35:36.060 --> 35:40.380
But if you click on the link in the blue box here,

35:40.380 --> 35:41.980
you can get it for free.

35:42.100 --> 35:47.100
And that's because ISO gives away ISO standards free

35:49.620 --> 35:53.900
if they are used to create other standards.

35:55.220 --> 35:59.220
And this particular ISO standard, both part one and two,

35:59.220 --> 36:01.980
and I assume this will apply to parts three and four,

36:01.980 --> 36:05.220
also are used to build other standards.

36:05.220 --> 36:08.580
That's what they're there for, and so they're free.

36:08.580 --> 36:10.220
So this describes the requirements

36:10.260 --> 36:12.220
for being a top-level ontology.

36:12.220 --> 36:16.580
Part two describes BFO and shows that BFO

36:16.580 --> 36:18.620
also meets those requirements.

36:18.620 --> 36:21.700
And this part two, you can also get free

36:21.700 --> 36:24.820
by pressing on the blue button.

36:26.220 --> 36:31.220
And now this is a part of a list of ontologies today,

36:32.340 --> 36:34.780
which is to say within the two years

36:34.780 --> 36:37.420
of the appearance of the ISO standard,

36:37.420 --> 36:39.660
which are outside biology and medicine.

36:39.660 --> 36:42.740
So in other words, where BFO was initially used

36:42.740 --> 36:46.180
primarily in the medical and biological sphere,

36:46.180 --> 36:48.500
it's now used in many other spheres.

36:48.500 --> 36:52.620
Not all of these are post-ISO,

36:52.620 --> 36:56.940
but many of them are, and the more important ones are,

36:56.940 --> 36:59.140
because people in different domains,

36:59.140 --> 37:01.020
not just in biology and medicine,

37:02.140 --> 37:04.900
but also in other domains, and I, military,

37:04.900 --> 37:08.740
I keep repeating, they need ontology too,

37:08.740 --> 37:11.940
and they have discovered that if you need ontology,

37:11.940 --> 37:13.940
then you need ontologies, which are organized

37:13.940 --> 37:17.260
in some kind of suite, and then you need a top-level

37:17.260 --> 37:20.500
in order to give logical coherence to the suite.

37:21.860 --> 37:24.740
All right, so let's, I was going to have a slide,

37:24.740 --> 37:27.100
which would be my only French slide,

37:27.100 --> 37:32.100
which said question, but I forgot, so any question?

37:38.740 --> 37:41.100
I have a very ontological question.

37:41.100 --> 37:45.620
Your example about the arm being a truantist part.

37:45.620 --> 37:49.980
And your arm is kind of independent continuance,

37:49.980 --> 37:52.060
even being attached to the body,

37:52.060 --> 37:56.700
because it has a concept, this flow of personality.

37:56.700 --> 38:00.300
Yes, the issue is exclusively the nature of the boundary.

38:01.460 --> 38:04.700
If you tear off the arm, you have an object.

38:04.700 --> 38:08.340
It's independent, so the criteria is the connection.

38:09.340 --> 38:11.420
I have some for the discussion.

38:11.420 --> 38:13.260
All right, we can go back to that.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.540
Think of the no-smoking zone.

38:16.540 --> 38:19.420
No, that's a boys' case, the boys' one.

38:19.420 --> 38:20.260
Well, it's the same.

38:20.260 --> 38:21.500
The left side of the room.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.980
An arm belonging, and a not arm belonging zone,

38:24.980 --> 38:27.020
and the arm belonging zone is up here.

38:28.380 --> 38:30.620
And the line between them is here.

38:30.620 --> 38:33.900
All right, so now let's go back to the BFO.

38:33.900 --> 38:37.460
At the very top, we have continuance and occurrence.

38:37.460 --> 38:42.300
So continuance exists through time, occurrence occur in time,

38:42.300 --> 38:45.740
and the test is whether something has temporal parts.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.460
Your life has temporal parts.

38:47.460 --> 38:51.140
Your youth is a temporal part of your life.

38:51.140 --> 38:54.940
It's not a part of you, it's a part of your life.

38:54.940 --> 38:56.900
You do not have any temporal parts.

38:56.900 --> 39:00.020
You have physical parts, or three-dimensional parts,

39:00.020 --> 39:03.060
or spatial parts, your arm, for instance.

39:04.420 --> 39:06.060
But your youth is not a part of you,

39:06.060 --> 39:07.060
it's a part of your life.

39:07.060 --> 39:08.780
So the life is an occurrence.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.180
You are a continuance.

39:11.660 --> 39:17.220
And we now distinguish between independent continuance

39:17.220 --> 39:18.500
and dependent continuance.

39:18.500 --> 39:22.100
Now, thing, object, and so on are words

39:22.100 --> 39:25.140
which can be used to describe independent continuance,

39:25.140 --> 39:28.260
and people use words like attribute or property

39:28.260 --> 39:31.700
and so forth to describe dependent continuance.

39:31.700 --> 39:34.020
We will talk about the different kinds

39:34.020 --> 39:36.500
of dependent continuance in a minute.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.740
And then occurrence are things like processes,

39:38.740 --> 39:42.100
events, happenings, things we go on,

39:43.420 --> 39:46.060
sometimes processes in which nothing goes on.

39:46.060 --> 39:50.060
So the process of these lights being switched on

39:51.340 --> 39:53.740
is an occurrence in BFO terms,

39:53.740 --> 39:55.140
because it has temporal parts,

39:55.140 --> 39:58.540
namely the morning lights being switched on

39:58.540 --> 40:00.660
and the afternoon lights being switched on.

40:01.660 --> 40:04.700
This is called a state or a stasis

40:04.700 --> 40:08.580
in some people's dialect.

40:09.740 --> 40:14.740
And now, qualities and roles are the two big groups

40:18.580 --> 40:21.340
of attributes, and the qualities would be something

40:21.340 --> 40:24.860
like your temperature, your height, your weight.

40:25.540 --> 40:30.540
And every quality, every attribute demands a bearer.

40:34.140 --> 40:37.860
So there is no height or weight or temperature

40:37.860 --> 40:39.260
unless it is the height or weight

40:39.260 --> 40:41.380
or temperature of some object.

40:41.380 --> 40:45.660
So the dependent continuance depends on some bearer.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.460
And then we have occurrence,

40:49.460 --> 40:51.700
and the occurrence also depends.

40:52.580 --> 40:55.780
Every event depends on some participant.

40:55.780 --> 40:58.380
There are no events, no processes, no incidents,

40:58.380 --> 41:00.620
no happenings which take place

41:00.620 --> 41:04.020
unless there is some independent continuance

41:04.020 --> 41:07.020
in which or between which they happen.

41:08.900 --> 41:12.780
And all of these are axioms in the BFO axiom set.

41:12.780 --> 41:16.220
And now we have instances which do not belong to BFO.

41:16.220 --> 41:20.820
BFO is above the line, and then all the instances,

41:20.860 --> 41:22.620
all the cells, all the molecules,

41:22.620 --> 41:24.420
all the planets, all the galaxies,

41:25.380 --> 41:27.900
are instances of the BFO kind object.

41:28.900 --> 41:33.900
And so above the line we have what we sometimes call classes,

41:35.340 --> 41:39.300
I think I use the word kind already, types, universals,

41:39.300 --> 41:42.100
that really those words all mean the same thing.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.340
They are what is general,

41:43.340 --> 41:46.220
and then the instances are what is particular.

41:46.220 --> 41:49.220
And qualities have instances.

41:49.220 --> 41:53.020
Your weight is an instance of the kind weight,

41:53.020 --> 41:55.420
and my weight is an instance of the kind weight.

41:56.820 --> 42:01.820
And now databases typically are about instances

42:01.980 --> 42:05.180
where ontologies again, typically are about types

42:05.180 --> 42:08.220
or classes or categories or universals or generals.

42:09.580 --> 42:13.740
And then we use the ontologies to tag the instance data.

42:13.740 --> 42:16.860
So this is a very, very crude dichotomy.

42:16.860 --> 42:19.300
We put the two together, we get knowledge back.

42:21.620 --> 42:25.660
And now Ryan Ricucci again, I should change this slide.

42:28.100 --> 42:30.220
Is an instance of the kind human being.

42:30.220 --> 42:34.220
So that is actually him, it's not a photo of him.

42:34.220 --> 42:35.420
Actually you can see it.

42:37.420 --> 42:39.140
He is an instance of the kind human being,

42:39.140 --> 42:40.820
which is a subkind of the kind object,

42:40.820 --> 42:43.780
which is a subkind of the kind independent continuum.

42:43.780 --> 42:45.620
And then there are lots of occurrences

42:45.620 --> 42:49.940
which are instances of process.

42:51.620 --> 42:56.620
And now we have more complicated examples,

42:56.940 --> 42:59.780
the Hoover Dam and the resilience of the Hoover Dam.

42:59.780 --> 43:02.180
Those are instances.

43:02.180 --> 43:05.500
And the decline in resilience of the Hoover Dam over time

43:05.500 --> 43:07.740
is an instance of the kind process.

43:07.740 --> 43:10.660
So now we have a process, which is a change

43:10.660 --> 43:13.020
in an attribute of an object,

43:13.860 --> 43:18.660
rather than a process, which is an example

43:18.660 --> 43:22.660
of an instantiation of change in an object.

43:23.620 --> 43:26.940
Change in attributes means it gets less and less resilient.

43:26.940 --> 43:30.740
Change in object means that it loses stones,

43:30.740 --> 43:32.940
gradually becomes smaller.

43:34.300 --> 43:36.060
So on the left we have what is

43:36.060 --> 43:38.180
and on the right we have what happens.

43:38.180 --> 43:40.500
And Ryan's here again.

43:40.540 --> 43:44.300
So Ryan's temperature is an instance of the kind temperature,

43:44.300 --> 43:49.140
which is a subclass or subkind of the kind quality.

43:49.140 --> 43:51.660
And Ryan's life is an instance of the kind life.

43:52.980 --> 43:56.220
And we can put all of those together with information.

43:57.700 --> 44:02.700
So information entities are about all of these other things

44:02.820 --> 44:04.940
and they come in different varieties

44:04.940 --> 44:07.020
such as name, address, telephone number,

44:07.020 --> 44:09.340
and they have instances too,

44:09.340 --> 44:12.180
namely Ryan's name, Ryan's telephone number.

44:12.180 --> 44:16.900
And there are seven Ryan Rikuchi's known to man,

44:16.900 --> 44:19.300
I'm assuming there are at least seven,

44:19.300 --> 44:24.300
but there's only one name of this Ryan Rikuchi.

44:24.940 --> 44:27.460
It looks exactly the same as the other six names

44:27.460 --> 44:29.020
of the other Ryan Rikuchi's,

44:29.020 --> 44:31.580
but there are in fact seven names

44:31.580 --> 44:36.140
of the seven Ryan Rikuchi and so on.

44:36.140 --> 44:38.340
And that's a picture of Ryan, it's not him.

44:39.460 --> 44:40.740
That's a picture of him.

44:42.380 --> 44:44.380
All right, and then we've done this.

44:44.380 --> 44:45.820
Oh yeah, realisables.

44:45.820 --> 44:48.460
I mentioned realisable earlier

44:48.460 --> 44:51.220
and I'll say something about them again.

44:51.220 --> 44:54.420
So dispositions are the most interesting example

44:54.420 --> 44:55.260
of realisable.

44:55.260 --> 44:59.060
So dispositions are potentials, tendencies.

44:59.060 --> 45:01.580
I have a disposition to lose hair.

45:01.580 --> 45:05.300
Bananas have a disposition to get ripe and so on.

45:05.300 --> 45:07.780
So they're tendencies, potentials.

45:07.820 --> 45:09.740
We don't really know much about dispositions.

45:09.740 --> 45:11.140
There are many of them.

45:11.140 --> 45:14.020
There's lots of junk dispositions everywhere.

45:14.020 --> 45:16.180
We don't have names for many of them.

45:16.180 --> 45:21.180
Science is about them, diseases are dispositions.

45:23.060 --> 45:24.760
Which snow med doesn't quite get.

45:26.500 --> 45:30.180
But now some dispositions are really special

45:30.180 --> 45:32.580
and that there are fewer of these.

45:32.580 --> 45:35.820
And these are the dispositions which crudely speaking,

45:35.820 --> 45:40.820
we want to have, we want there to be dispositions like this

45:41.460 --> 45:43.900
and we call them capabilities.

45:43.900 --> 45:46.740
So your car can play music.

45:47.620 --> 45:49.940
I'm assuming you have a stereo in your car.

45:51.420 --> 45:53.100
But that's not the function of your car.

45:53.100 --> 45:56.220
It's just a capability and so on.

45:56.220 --> 45:58.820
So people do the washing up

45:58.820 --> 46:01.660
but that's not the function of people.

46:01.660 --> 46:04.140
And you can use a screwdriver as a weapon

46:04.140 --> 46:05.940
but that's not the function of a screwdriver.

46:05.940 --> 46:10.940
So capabilities are dispositions which are like functions.

46:11.820 --> 46:14.260
It's good to have them but they're not functions.

46:14.260 --> 46:17.140
They are side effects, if you like.

46:17.140 --> 46:19.340
And we're still trying to work out

46:19.340 --> 46:20.860
a good definition of capability.

46:20.860 --> 46:24.260
We don't, capability is not yet a term in BFO.

46:24.260 --> 46:27.580
Disposition is in BFO and function is in BFO.

46:27.580 --> 46:30.100
Capability, it might take 10 years

46:30.100 --> 46:33.260
before we are really happy with the constitution.

46:33.260 --> 46:38.260
And so that means that BFO develops slowly.

46:41.100 --> 46:44.060
People who know a lot about BFO have been trained

46:44.060 --> 46:48.460
to be really evil when it comes to finding arguments

46:48.460 --> 46:49.700
against decisions.

46:50.660 --> 46:52.820
And so that means decisions are made very slowly

46:52.820 --> 46:55.340
and carefully, we'd like to think.

46:55.340 --> 46:58.380
All right, now functions are a bit easier.

46:58.380 --> 47:01.920
A function is the reason for the existence of its bearer.

47:01.960 --> 47:04.600
So the function of a screwdriver is to screw screws.

47:04.600 --> 47:06.760
That's why we have screwdriver.

47:06.760 --> 47:09.760
The function of cars is to transport passengers.

47:09.760 --> 47:11.640
Function of eyes is to see.

47:11.640 --> 47:14.360
Function of your digestive system is to digest.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.800
Functions are easy.

47:17.800 --> 47:21.280
Capabilities are like functions but they're difficult.

47:21.280 --> 47:23.840
And one definition of biological capability

47:23.840 --> 47:27.840
is that they are dispositions

47:27.840 --> 47:30.160
which contribute to the realization

47:30.200 --> 47:31.680
of biological functions.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.520
So you can go away and think about that.

47:37.560 --> 47:39.720
All right, so we get the same kind of picture.

47:39.720 --> 47:43.920
So we realize the function of John's eye

47:43.920 --> 47:46.840
in John's seeing, which is a process.

47:48.480 --> 47:52.200
And now only certain kinds of entities have functions.

47:52.200 --> 47:54.400
And I don't know of any kinds of entities

47:54.400 --> 47:56.560
other than the ones on this list.

47:56.600 --> 48:01.160
So perhaps worker beings have functions.

48:02.240 --> 48:06.640
And queen bees and worker ants and so-called carpenter ants.

48:06.640 --> 48:10.360
I don't know, but organisms in general do not have function.

48:11.640 --> 48:13.960
It is not my function to do on top of it.

48:16.760 --> 48:20.640
I'm sure about that, even though it sometimes seems

48:22.320 --> 48:24.320
not to be the case for me.

48:24.320 --> 48:27.560
All right, now maybe companies, organizations have functions

48:27.560 --> 48:31.080
but they're a bit like colonial organisms in this way, maybe.

48:32.960 --> 48:34.520
So there are many more capabilities

48:34.520 --> 48:35.680
than there are functions.

48:37.640 --> 48:39.920
And this is how it might look.

48:39.920 --> 48:42.120
The future BFO might look like this.

48:43.280 --> 48:45.600
So we have dispositions of the broad class,

48:45.600 --> 48:47.200
capabilities are a subclass

48:47.200 --> 48:50.880
and then functions are a subclass of that subclass.

48:51.880 --> 48:54.680
But now there are two kinds of realizable entities.

48:54.680 --> 48:59.560
In addition to dispositions, we also have roles.

48:59.560 --> 49:02.000
Now dispositions are defined

49:02.000 --> 49:04.480
on the basis of the physics of the bearer.

49:04.480 --> 49:08.720
So the reason why I have a disposition to go of all

49:08.720 --> 49:13.920
is because of the physics of my head's metabolism, I don't know.

49:14.120 --> 49:16.120
I don't know why I have that.

49:17.120 --> 49:22.120
Roles are defined externally by decisions,

49:23.120 --> 49:28.120
by demarcations, by stymings of contracts and so forth.

49:29.120 --> 49:36.120
And so roles are the products of social organization, basically.

49:36.120 --> 49:39.120
Being employed is a role, being fired is a role.

49:39.120 --> 49:43.920
You can be employed because your contract

49:43.920 --> 49:46.320
that you signed four days ago comes into effect

49:46.320 --> 49:47.720
at midnight in a week.

49:48.720 --> 49:52.720
You do not change physically at all at midnight in a week,

49:52.720 --> 49:56.920
at all in a way which is relevant to being an employee,

49:56.920 --> 50:00.120
but you have the role at that point in time

50:00.120 --> 50:02.120
because that's what the contract is.

50:03.920 --> 50:06.320
So roles are not a matter of physics,

50:06.320 --> 50:09.320
they're a matter of a certain entity being

50:09.320 --> 50:12.720
in certain social institutional circumstances

50:14.120 --> 50:17.520
and in virtue of being in that set of circumstances

50:17.520 --> 50:22.320
such as being the object described in an employment contract

50:22.320 --> 50:24.320
you acquire or lose a certain role.

50:25.320 --> 50:28.320
And this just repeats what I just said.

50:28.920 --> 50:32.520
Now interestingly, there are roles which form systems.

50:32.520 --> 50:37.520
These are examples of two-sided mutual dependence among roles,

50:38.520 --> 50:43.520
which are rather simple ones and then there are more complicated ones.

50:43.520 --> 50:46.520
Now, BFO has been used in many areas.

50:47.520 --> 50:53.520
One area where we still do not have anything like usable ontology content

50:53.520 --> 50:54.520
is the law.

50:55.520 --> 50:57.520
We're working a little bit on economics,

50:58.520 --> 51:00.520
but we don't have a good ontology of law.

51:00.520 --> 51:05.520
This may be one way of starting the ontology of law in terms of role.

51:06.520 --> 51:10.520
And there is an ontology called de-act, document act ontology,

51:10.520 --> 51:14.520
which is following something like this line.

51:14.520 --> 51:19.520
That may be where we start, but it's not established itself

51:19.520 --> 51:24.520
in the way that it should establish itself as the ontology of law,

51:24.520 --> 51:25.520
which is what we want.

51:26.520 --> 51:33.520
And this is the authority ontology, or an authority ontology,

51:33.520 --> 51:35.520
which again might serve as a starting point.

51:37.520 --> 51:39.520
All right, so this is another picture of BFO.

51:39.520 --> 51:42.520
I left out all the space and time and location.

51:43.520 --> 51:45.520
I just have the things that we've talked about so far,

51:45.520 --> 51:47.520
like qualities, roles and so forth.

51:48.520 --> 51:53.520
And this gives us another opportunity to have question.

51:56.520 --> 51:59.520
What are your thoughts on the genesis?

52:16.520 --> 52:20.520
Yes, so Ryan Rikuchi's name is not just a string of letters.

52:20.520 --> 52:25.520
It's in so many ways, it's not just a string of letters.

52:25.520 --> 52:30.520
It came into existence at a certain time in history for instance.

52:31.520 --> 52:34.520
And the string of letters existed prior to that.

52:34.520 --> 52:37.520
There are almost certainly older Ryan Rikuchi somewhere out there.

52:37.520 --> 52:39.520
I'm not sure about the Ryan part.

52:39.520 --> 52:42.520
There is certainly other Rikuchi.

52:44.520 --> 52:46.520
But I'll give you a puzzle.

52:46.520 --> 52:52.520
John's credit card number is token for token identical

52:52.520 --> 52:55.520
with Frank's social security number.

52:55.520 --> 52:58.520
They're not the same number, they're not the same entity.

52:59.520 --> 53:04.520
But regardless of strings, they are by definition the same string.

53:05.520 --> 53:09.520
So this is the social objects get complicated very quickly.

53:11.520 --> 53:12.520
Yes.

53:12.520 --> 53:13.520
Yes.

53:25.520 --> 53:30.520
So every child has at least two parents, I guess.

53:30.520 --> 53:32.520
That would be a first guess.

53:34.520 --> 53:36.520
But it doesn't go in the opposite direction.

53:36.520 --> 53:40.520
Not every adult male human has a child.

53:40.520 --> 53:42.520
Not every adult female human has a child.

53:42.520 --> 53:45.520
Not every pair of adult males and females have a child.

53:45.520 --> 53:48.520
So here you have one-sided dependence.

53:48.520 --> 53:52.520
The example I gave on the screen were two-sided dependence.

53:56.520 --> 53:58.520
Oh no, yes, you're right.

53:58.520 --> 54:01.520
Not all of these dependence relations are going to be roles.

54:03.520 --> 54:09.520
Now, when you adopt though, if you adopt a child, that would be a role.

54:11.520 --> 54:12.520
Yes.

54:12.520 --> 54:16.520
So having a child is biology, which is physics in the end.

54:16.520 --> 54:23.520
Adoption is partly biology and partly physics, but the core of it is a role kind of phenomenon.

54:23.520 --> 54:28.520
And there might be other similar role phenomena having to do with parents and children.

54:28.520 --> 54:34.520
So, well, I don't want to think too hard about it.

54:35.520 --> 54:37.520
Kidnapping.

54:38.520 --> 54:41.520
All right, any more?

54:42.520 --> 54:46.520
So we've seen this picture already, but now we have green at the top.

54:46.520 --> 54:51.520
And I just mentioned that we have a granularity axis.

54:51.520 --> 54:56.520
So molecules of small cells and cellular components are larger than organs and organisms are larger.

54:56.520 --> 55:00.520
And then we have populations which are not on this chart.

55:00.520 --> 55:05.520
But we've been adding to the elbow foundry over the years.

55:05.520 --> 55:07.520
This is still the 2005 version.

55:07.520 --> 55:11.520
Even then, this is something of an idealization even then.

55:11.520 --> 55:18.520
First of all, we added the environment ontology, which covers all granularities because there are molecular environments.

55:18.520 --> 55:21.520
There are cellular environments or environments of organisms.

55:21.520 --> 55:26.520
Organisms, there are environments, all populations, tribe and so forth.

55:27.520 --> 55:34.520
And then there is the ontology for biomedical investigations.

55:34.520 --> 55:41.520
OB, which is one of the best of all the oboe foundry ontology when it comes to the quality of the engineering of the ontology.

55:41.520 --> 55:43.520
And this is about experimental processes.

55:43.520 --> 55:46.520
So it goes on the occurrence side.

55:46.520 --> 55:59.520
So what happened was that the biologists in the world of the genome project knew that they needed ontologies of biological entities, processes, cells and so forth.

55:59.520 --> 56:05.520
But then they discovered at a certain point in time, and I was at the meetings where this discovery was made.

56:05.520 --> 56:07.520
It wasn't my idea.

56:07.520 --> 56:13.520
They discovered that they needed ontologies to describe the experiments.

56:13.520 --> 56:35.520
And they needed ontologies to describe the ontologies to describe the data coming from those experiments because how you interpret a biological argument or a biological hypothesis or a biological conclusion in a biological paper depends on the methods which were used to reach that conclusion.

56:35.520 --> 56:39.520
And so you needed to have an ontology of experimental methods.

56:39.520 --> 56:41.520
And that's what OB is.

56:41.520 --> 57:04.520
It's an ontology, not just the methods, but also equipment, hypotheses, parameters, inputs, outputs, data, data processing, material processing processes.

57:04.520 --> 57:09.520
Sometimes in biology, you do experiments by looking at data and processing.

57:09.520 --> 57:10.520
And you have an output.

57:10.520 --> 57:12.520
You have input is data, output is data.

57:12.520 --> 57:20.520
Sometimes you do experiments by taking material as input, and then you have data as output data about that material.

57:20.520 --> 57:27.520
Then they realized that they needed an ontology of the evidence that would be generated by an experiment.

57:27.520 --> 57:45.520
So there is something called the evidence ontology, which distinguishes, for instance, between conclusions which were drawn by direct observation, conclusions drawn from computational computation.

57:45.520 --> 57:52.520
And then I think one of them is something like inference drawn from paper.

57:52.520 --> 57:59.520
So that it's not a very, not all of the codes in the evidence code ontology describe strong evidence.

57:59.520 --> 58:08.520
The idea is that if you have multiple kinds of evidence for a given biological conclusion, then you should be able to document that in something like an ontology.

58:08.520 --> 58:13.520
All right, so then we, so we have the ontology for biomedical investigation.

58:13.520 --> 58:37.520
And we realized, and here I was involved directly in the decision making, we realized that we needed terms for things like footnotes, or sentences, or vowels, or instructions, or papers, or grants, or grant submission documents and so forth.

58:37.520 --> 58:45.520
And so they were happily using protege to add all of these terms into OB.

58:45.520 --> 58:53.520
But then I said footnotes are not biological. They don't belong in a biology ontology.

58:53.520 --> 59:01.520
So it's not only biological investigations with biomedical investigations which use footnotes or vowels.

59:01.520 --> 59:08.520
And so we, we started building an information artifact ontology.

59:08.520 --> 59:18.520
And here too, I'm not sure this is a good thing, but here too I played a role as this decision. I named the ontology for biomedical investigations incidentally.

59:18.520 --> 59:32.520
Originally it was a joke name for FUMO or something, functional genomics, something, FUGO, something.

59:32.520 --> 59:41.520
And I said, no, it's not only about functional genomics. It's about all biomedical investigations. And so we should call it the ontology for biomedical investigations.

59:41.520 --> 59:46.520
In fact, we should have called it the ontology for investigation because it can be applied to physics.

59:46.520 --> 59:54.520
Maybe we should have called it the ontology for data and material processing activities because it can be applied to manufacturing.

59:54.520 --> 01:00:03.520
And in fact, here you have inputs which are material and outputs which are material and that that kind of input output chain falls under OB2.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.520
But anyway, we can't have everything.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:24.520
But we could have, now what would we call it, the information what ontology, if we call it the information ontology, we commit what I argue for legislative purposes, not because it's true.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.520
Although it is true.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.520
I argue that you should never use mass nouns when building an ontology.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:48.520
So if you think of sugar, sugar can mean the chemical substance, which is a kind of abstract universal, or it can mean two lumps of sugar, or it can mean all the sugar on the planet, or it can mean all the sugar ever in the history of the universe.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:01:00.520
And it's completely ambiguous what sugar means. But if you say lump of sugar, which is not a mass noun, it's a count noun, then you have something with the meaning of which you know.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:11.520
And if you look at snowmen, not today, but in the early days of snowmen, you find that they made mistakes because they used mass noun by blood.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:20.520
And they didn't because they were using a mass now they made certain characteristic errors which people make when they use mass now. So I say never use mass now.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.520
Information is a mass now.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:28.520
And indeed, if you use the mass now information you make mistakes.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:38.520
So people who say that the genome is information are making a mistake.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:54.520
A sequence, which is created by a sequencer and a computer and printed out or printed on a screen or just stored in a database. That is a piece of information.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:02:07.520
The other structures which that piece of information in somebody's hard drive picture or represent is not information it's biology molecules in patterns.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:19.520
So many people, maybe fewer now than then but in that era, the idea that genomics was a branch of computer science or information science was very popular.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:38.520
We wanted to work against that. And so we kind I coined the term for the ontology information artifact ontology so that we made it clear that we're dealing with artifacts, which is to say things made by human beings, streams, databases,

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:46.520
footnotes, grant submissions, addresses names, telephone numbers and so on. These are all information.

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:52.520
And that's what the information artifact ontology is all about.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:03:09.520
I mean the information artifact ontology terms are representing instances, which are about instances of disease processes and all of the other things that biologists care about.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:24.520
And that's the key term in the information artifact ontology and information artifact ontology is roughly speaking a copyable entity, which is about something.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:34.520
We have modular suites of ontologies, like the over foundry. What do they bring us? Well, first of all, we have a division of labor.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:44.520
I will do proteins and you will do RNA. And we won't that we will thereby have a clear boundary between what you do and what I do.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:51.520
This also means that anyone who needs a protein ontology knows where to find it because it's called the protein ontology.

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.520
That's another rule that people often break.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:06.520
So instead of calling their ontology the spider affordance ontology or, well, let's say the spider activity ontology in honor of the building that we're in.

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:13.520
Instead of calling the spider activity ontology, they call it the Santa Barbara something.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:21.520
And nobody knows what it is. And so nobody uses it outside Santa Barbara.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:34.520
All right, then it because people are working on modular suites of ontologies, they're using BFO over and over again, they become experts at using BFO over and over again.

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:50.520
Because somebody is in charge of the protein ontology and is known to be in charge of the protein ontology that somebody has a special reason to be devoting a great deal of scientific expertise and effort to make sure that protein ontology is done properly.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:05:08.520
Also, users will be motivated to use the ontology and to find errors in and report those errors because if they're using the ontology they want the ontology to be good.

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:15.520
If it's if it's going to be good and you find an error you have to tell the ontology editors about the error.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:26.520
That makes it better, which means gives you an even better motive for using it yourself in a kind of virtuous circle.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:32.520
And I won't go through this. So there have been four versions of BFO.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:38.520
Version number one was released in 2001.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:45.520
And it nothing changed for six years but then we added the information artifact ontology.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:54.520
And once we did that we realized that we needed a term in BFO, which would be the parent of information artifact.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.520
And we didn't have one.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.520
And so we created one and I'll talk about that in a minute.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:12.520
In 2015, I'll to came out and so we did an overhaul of BFO 1.1 to make it conform with BFO 2.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:28.520
And then in 20 in 2020, we released BFO 2020, which was released to take account of the fact that in the ISO standard data that so there is data associated with the ISO standard.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:39.520
About the first order logic formalization of BFO and also about the consistency proof, which is part of the accompanying data to the ISO standard.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:46.520
And so that is the core for the changes which we made in 2020 BFO itself.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.520
The picture that you saw has changed hardly at all.

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.520
The definitions are a bit tidier.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:57.520
The most important changes that we now have a first order logic formalization.

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.520
Alright, so that's the picture again.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:06.520
And now I'm going to talk about how we dealt with information artifacts.

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:11.520
And so we've already seen this.

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:14.520
There are two kinds of specifically dependent continuance.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:27.520
There are qualities, which include patterns, pattern of a chessboard, for instance, would be a pattern and a pattern in the BFO sense, which is a continuum.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:32.520
And then there are realisables like functions and roles.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:37.520
And now notice that we say that these are specifically dependent continuance.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:43.520
In the Middle Ages, the philosophers who dealt with these questions had various axioms.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:48.520
One axiom was accidents do not migrate.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.520
So they had substances and they had accidents.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:08:02.520
And one famous Italian metaphysician concluded, this was in the time of the plague, concluded from this axiom that the plague does not exist.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.520
Because accidents do not migrate.

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:09.520
They couldn't see the bacteria or the virus.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.520
I don't know if you are.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.520
And so they didn't know that they were there.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:16.520
They just saw the accidents, presumably the symptoms and so forth in the people.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:20.520
Since accidents don't migrate, there can be no play.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:33.520
This argument was seriously put forward and it's the motto for an Italian novel of some repute called You Promise Those Both Me.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:38.520
Anyway, I recommend the novel and the motto is about why the plague does not exist.

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:46.520
Now the plague does exist because viruses can move around and bacteria can move around.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.520
But specifically dependent continuance cannot migrate.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.520
I cannot have your headed.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.520
I cannot have your height.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.520
I cannot have your name.

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:02.520
I cannot have your capabilities.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:11.520
Even if my capabilities are qualitatively identical to your capability, my capabilities are mine and your capabilities are yours.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.520
They are specifically dependent on their bear.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:23.520
But there are some dependent continuance which can migrate and they are generically dependent on their bearers.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:28.520
And an example would be, well, the PDF file on my laptop.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.520
I have a certain PDF file.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:36.520
I send it to Ryan and now the very same PDF file is in two places.

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.520
It's copyable.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:47.520
And if I now destroy the PDF file on my laptop, the PDF file still exists because it's on his laptop.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.520
And that's what we mean by generically dependent continuance.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:10:01.520
We mean continuance which are dependent upon some independent, continuant bearer such as a hard drive, but which are not specifically dependent on any bearer.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.520
All you need is one, but it could move around.

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.520
Typically there will be many copies.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:13.520
So a novel is a specifically dependent, is a generically dependent continuance because the novel exists in many copies.

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:21.520
Emails that you send are generically dependent continuance because they exist both on the sender and on the receiver side.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.520
And DNA sequences are generically dependent continuance.

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:44.520
Two, both in both senses, both the sense of the sequence in the sequence database and the sense of sequence as meaning a molecular pattern, which is copied as we all know trillions of times in every human being.

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:48.520
Alright, so that's where we get information artifacts into BFO.

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:59.520
They're all children of the new kind, new type, new universal that we introduced in BFO 2.0, namely generically dependent continuum.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:11.520
Now we did not introduce the new kind information artifact because generically dependent continuance are entities which are domain neutral.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:26.520
You can in principle find generically dependent continuance in any domain, but information artifacts are restricted to domains where there are entities like people who make copies of things like email.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:36.520
And so we added the term generically dependent continuance because it was of the appropriate level to go into a top level ontology.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:42.520
And now I don't think I'll go into this one maybe.

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:48.520
So in we now realize that we needed to add a new relation.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:54.520
So let's suppose you make a plan, you maybe write it down, and it's in your head.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:12:02.520
And you're going to deal and you have a team of people ready to follow the specification that you dictate.

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:16.520
Then the plan is concretized in patterns of ink on your printed document where you've been writing out or written document.

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:22.520
In other words, it's made concrete, it's turned into something which is more like a specifically dependent continuum.

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:32.520
Patterns of ink, different piles of ink, raised levels of ink, we call letters of the alphabet.

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:40.520
And also when you read the plan specification in your head, and there's something like a concretization of the plan in your head.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:48.520
And that's what you will realize that will be the starting point for your realizing plan when you say you read it and you say to yourself I like this plan.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:55.520
Let's realize this plan and then you tell all your underlings to go forth and realize.

01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:01.520
And so we added the relation of concretization to BFO and the whole story looks like this.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:09.520
So we have generic independent continuance, then there are information entities, there are things like gene sequences on the other side, the biological side.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.520
And these are all examples of information artifacts.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:21.520
So a symphony by that we mean that which is concretized in the score.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:28.520
And sort of in the performance too. The performance is not so important, it's the score which matters.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:36.520
And poems are the same.

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:45.520
And then we have information bearing entities, which are material entities, they have patterns according to what has been written onto them.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:54.520
The pattern on your hard drive is an information quality entity, which is a kind of quality, which is a kind of specifically dependent continuum.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:14:03.520
And then the information content, so the information artifact is concretized by the information quality entity which depends upon the information bearing entity.

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:07.520
All right. And that's the definition.

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:16.520
So an artifact is something created deliberately and an information artifact is an artifact that can be the bearer of information.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:22.520
All right. Now we have more time for question. Anybody.

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:29.520
So my question is regarding the, you mentioned that UFO is a realist.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.520
Yeah.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:38.520
But we're wondering like, which isn't do you think it's the presentism or the universe.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:42.520
We're wondering maybe you can affect all the plants that are there.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:49.520
So I hate four-dimensionalists. And so there are some people who develop four-dimensionalist ontologies.

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:54.520
And we could talk for an hour about this.

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:59.520
And the oil industry actually is the principle hunting ground of these people.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:12.520
I was a, for a time, a hero of our oil engineers in Norway because they were being forced to use a four-dimensional ontology and it made their life much more difficult than it needed to be made.

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:18.520
I don't like four-dimensionalist ontologies. And I think that they are incoherent.

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:38.520
And it's interesting that of all the ontologies which have been, which have some sort of a track record, namely psych, dolce, BFO, GFO, UFO, sumo, they're all three plus one dimensional.

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:42.520
In other words, three spatial and one temporal ontology.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:46.520
None of them are four-dimensional. Four-dimensional ontology says that everything is a process.

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:51.520
So you are a process of, what's your name? Eric.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:57.520
You're a process of continual erring. Continual erring going on over in that corner.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:06.520
And that's silly. And it's really silly if you want to apply it to oil industry plant because the plant is not a process.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:13.520
Also maybe like you have a present system that you just have a present and growing growth that you have a present and a past.

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:23.520
Yeah. So I guess I'd lean a little way towards the block version, but I left open the issue of reality in the future.

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:31.520
And I also left open the big Q question, which if we got time, we will actually address.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:35.520
I was wondering about the generically dependent continuum.

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.520
On the one hand, we have some very simple examples of patterns, which are universal.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:45.520
And maybe the chessboard pattern could be regarded as a universal. It's simply.

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:52.520
But if you take the pattern, which is the fields of Norway, that's too complicated to be a university.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:58.520
It has to be thrown together by accidents. We know that it was by accidents and glaciation.

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.520
Many millennia, I guess.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:06.520
Now, Tolstoy's war and peace was more like the Theodos of Norway.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:11.520
And even a relatively short poem is more like Theodos of Norway.

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:18.520
And even the president of Italy, the president, the office is more like the Theodos of Norway.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:29.520
Now, where is the line between Theodos of Norway type things on the one hand and universal, like square or triangle or vowel or...

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.520
I don't know. DNA.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:36.520
Well, DNA, I think is on the Norway side of things.

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:39.520
So the DNA molecule is a universal.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:47.520
But this DNA molecule, for which we need 36,000 lines of code or something in order to capture, that is not the universe.

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:52.520
Even though it's repeated many times, war and peace is repeated many times.

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.520
But that doesn't mean it's the universe.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:59.520
War and peace is an instance. It's an instance of the type novel.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.520
A copy of war and peace is an instance.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:08.520
It's an instance of the type copy of war and peace.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:12.520
But copy of war and peace is not going to count as a real university.

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:16.520
It's going to be a defining class. It's going to be a convenience class.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.520
Okay, so now I'm going to talk about foundry.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.520
So this is a hub and spokes picture that I like.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:32.520
The idea is that when we build a foundry, we're networking ontology.

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:35.520
So the networking arises in a number of different ways.

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:39.520
So first of all, you start with the hub, which in many cases is BFO.

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:43.520
And then you define domain ontology terms by using the hub.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:47.520
So you'd use the word object as a starting point for defining a cell.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:53.520
And then you create all the different kinds of cells and you package the whole thing as a cell ontology.

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.520
And you do that for many other things. And it is being done for many other things.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:04.520
But now in each case, when you introduce a new term and thereby a new class in your ontology,

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.520
you define that term.

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:12.520
And very often you will use terms from other ontologies in your network.

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:19.520
And all of these terms, both the terms as defined and the terms as they appear in definitions,

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.520
will be associated with IRI.

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:26.520
So they will be networked together within the internet.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:32.520
But also they will be networked together because the same term might be used in 17 different definitions

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.520
from 14 different ontologies.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:42.520
And so there are networking effects across ontologies through terms and through internet connections.

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:50.520
And the oboe foundry now has reached the point where it can maintain the ontologies as a whole,

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.520
where you make one change in one term.

01:19:53.520 --> 01:20:01.520
Then that means that when that change is made, it may have impacts on the 14 other places where that term is used.

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:10.520
And they can control how these impacts are spread through the entire network in a very impressive way.

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:16.520
All right. Now, how do we go about building a top-level ontology?

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:30.520
So I was in a meeting in somewhere in, I can't remember where it was, in Europe, not long ago.

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.520
And there was a poster session.

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:37.520
And in the poster session, there were seven young ontologists.

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:44.520
All of them were working on slightly different aspects of, I don't know, lasers or something.

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:50.520
And they all had sort of interesting results and interesting bits of a laser process ontology.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:54.520
But they were all working independently of each other.

01:20:54.520 --> 01:21:00.520
And I said, it's clear that you are all working on the same arena of topics.

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:05.520
You should get together and build some kind of a foundry.

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.520
Or you should find other people who have already built a relevant foundry.

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:14.520
So you want to build a foundry.

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:20.520
You've decided that you don't want to continue to build small snippets of bits of ontology for yourself.

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:24.520
You want to do things which will contribute to science in the public sense.

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:34.520
And so you choose your top level, which should be small and well-documented and so forth.

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.520
So BFO might be chosen.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.520
And your top level should have understandable definitions.

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:47.520
We're working on that, but we think we do pretty well, given the complexity of some of our needs.

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:49.520
It should be well formalized.

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:52.520
Well, we think we're doing pretty well on that front.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:54.520
And this is the crucial thing.

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:58.520
It should be easily extendable by domain ontology.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.520
So you need to know what a laser is.

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.520
Well, a laser is an object in BFO terms.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.520
What is laser light?

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.520
What is the operation of a laser?

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:09.520
Well, you can find BFO terms for those things too.

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:16.520
And you can define them in such a way that you link the terms in your laser ontologies together through BFO.

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:23.520
And then because you're using BFO, you'll have people like me who can look at what you're doing and tell you that you're doing it wrong.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.520
Or right even.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:32.520
Where if you have your own secret methodology, then probably no one will ever tell you that you're doing it wrong.

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:39.520
And BFO also changes only slowly, which means you can trust it to have a half-life of five years.

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:42.520
And even then the change will be quite small.

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:50.520
And BFO is aggressively quality controlled.

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:58.520
And there are various principles that we impose upon the ontologies in the foundry.

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.520
So you have to have a top level.

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:10.520
There are some foundries which have been developed, which didn't have top levels, but they had relatively short half-lives.

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:17.520
You want to create ontology modules which are consistently developed,

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:28.520
which means that each group of developers of ontology A will be comparing notes with the developers of ontologies B, C and D,

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:33.520
because they are in neighboring domains to ensure consistency.

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:40.520
But you will also be communicating with the BCD people to make sure that there are no overlaps.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:48.520
And the reason for that is that you want everybody to know where you find the ontology for proteins.

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:54.520
And if there are protein ontology terms in the RNA ontology or in the cell ontology,

01:23:54.520 --> 01:24:01.520
then that will mean that people will be disappointed when they find that they've been using the protein ontology for seven years.

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:10.520
And no one told them about those proteins which, for forgotten reasons, were dealt with in cell ontology.

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:19.520
So, non-overlapping ontology modules which are developed in such a way as to be consistent.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:30.520
And then what you need is users who will find gaps and errors and who will help you create useful documentation.

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:39.520
And I talked already about the virtuous cycle which arises when you have many users who point out mistakes in your ontology or gaps in your ontology.

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:46.520
And for that, and this is also an important principle, you need an effective feedback loop.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:58.520
So, I don't know how it is today, but in the olden days, the gene ontology had a commitment to its users that they would have a response to feedback within 48 hours.

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:05.520
Now, the response was not always an answer to the question, but it would be at least an answer of the form.

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:13.520
We are now exploring the question you raised, but very often they gave answers to questions directly.

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:18.520
The most common answer would be the term you are looking for is already there.

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:22.520
It's just four lines lower down and three lines across.

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:27.520
So, effective feedback loops between the users and the developers.

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:32.520
And that too creates a virtuous cycle.

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.520
All right, so there are many foundries.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:42.520
This is the digital construction ontology's foundry which goes on in Finland.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:51.520
And they have all of these ontologies which are about bin, which is building information management, modeling.

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.520
Anyway, they have a lot of data.

01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:06.520
And they have these ontologies which are developed in just the way that I am recommending as modules in a BFO framework.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:22.520
And you can see the BFO here is a pancake shaped or amoeba shaped grouping in blue at the top and then all the building terms descend from there.

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:30.520
So, asset roll descends from roll, for instance, legal person roll descends from roll.

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:41.520
We have a disaster response ontologies foundry which has been developed in France for the French disaster relief agencies.

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:46.520
And now most importantly, we have the dialogue foundry.

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:51.520
I say most importantly, partly for purely chronological reasons.

01:26:51.520 --> 01:27:02.520
So, we've been working for 12 years to get the dialogue foundry ontologies recognition on the part of the...

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:08.520
So, dialogue means the Department of Defense and the intelligence community.

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:12.520
So, the work was ignored or forgotten.

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:17.520
The working group was very active and then it died and then it became active again.

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:30.520
Finally, in June of this year, just a few days ago, we got definitive approval from high level officers,

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:40.520
not just of the intelligence community, but also from the Department of Defense, Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office,

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:49.520
formally recognizing the foundry projects or the foundry project plus a number of sub-projects

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:59.520
put forward by various DoD and IC agencies with a bit of help from ontology people on the academic side like me,

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:04.520
that they were going to be accepted as the standard across the DoD and the IC.

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:09.520
Now, next comes NATO.

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.520
That's next week. Actually, no, next week.

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:17.520
There is a NATO meeting at which this idea will be presented.

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:23.520
We only get 15 minutes in a three-day meeting, but it's the beginning.

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:26.520
And who knows what comes after NATO?

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:29.520
Well, this is what it might look like.

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:37.520
So this is the daiko verse like universe, but daiko is the Defense Intelligence Core ontology.

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:45.520
This is a group of ontologies, some of which don't exist yet, but there are teams of people who are building them or planning to build them,

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.520
some of which are already in use, the green ones are already in use.

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:57.520
And the idea is that the one of the ideas is that if you have a foundry like this,

01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:00.520
and this is a small version in different colors of the same foundry,

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:08.520
then this will create not just interoperability among data, but also cross-organizational knowledge.

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:18.520
So people working in the process activity ontology world will know to some degree what's going on in the geographic features domain

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:23.520
because they're both building ontologies which use the same top level and they form part of the same foundry,

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:28.520
which means that they communicate with each other at regular meetings.

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:37.520
So I think I'd better say something about time.

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:46.520
So as you can hear from my throat, I won't be able to do this forever.

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:50.520
I'm not planning on any changes, but there might be changes in the future.

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:54.520
And so we have a kind of succession plan for BFO.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:30:04.520
So the replacement king of ontology or king of BFO more precisely, you will hear from him in a few minutes.

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:09.520
He's going to give a short talk about current developments in the BFO world.

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:15.520
His name is John Beverly and he was just hired in our department in Buffalo.

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:25.520
Before that he worked for the Applied Physics Lab, which is a very large physics faculty which runs on government money.

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:37.520
They do physics for the government, for the DOD, but they have an ontology group which is populated primarily by former students of mine.

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:46.520
And he is one of them, but he's coming back to Buffalo because he believes in this succession plan.

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:55.520
But there is another member of the BFO succession, which he will not be talking today, but his name is Alan Rottenberg.

01:30:55.520 --> 01:31:01.520
Now Alan Rottenberg is a pain in the neck, but he's also brilliant.

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:06.520
So John Beverly is brilliant. He's not a pain in the neck.

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:10.520
Alan is a pain in the neck because he wants to get everything right.

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:18.520
Owl has a problem. It's very hard to get time right in owl.

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:25.520
And BFO is not a four-dimensionalist ontology. It's a three plus T dimensional ontology.

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:30.520
In other three spaces, of course, one central dimension, we want to get time right.

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:37.520
One solution is not to use owl, but to use first-order logic. It's easy to get time right using first-order logic.

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:43.520
It's very hard to get time right in owl because owl will only allow two-place relations.

01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:56.520
So you can say John loves Mary, you can say Mary loves John, but you can't say Mary loves John yesterday or tomorrow in owl because then you have a three-place relation.

01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:02.520
Now Alan first of all understands owl probably better than anybody else.

01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:09.520
So he plays three-dimensional chess with owl where the chess games extend into five years into the future.

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:12.520
So he knows what problems lurk behind the scenes.

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:23.520
And he knows that the current treatment of time in BFO actually and in any other ontology based on owl is problematic.

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:32.520
And for that reason, we released a version. It wasn't an official release.

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:44.520
It was a version released for public debate, which just deleted all the temporal relations which are affected by these out problems from the ontology.

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:55.520
So the classes were there, there is a hierarchy was there, all the time relations involving processes were there, but all the time relations involving occurrence were deleted.

01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:01.520
And people hated that and they said, oh, BFO, it's become chaotic.

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:08.520
In fact, we were trying to be very, very careful and avoiding logical problems which we knew lay down the road.

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:15.520
And if I had more time, I could describe those logical problems.

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:20.520
Now we have found a way which keeps everybody happy.

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:29.520
So we're going to have a release version and John Beverly will talk a little bit about that when he joins us in half an hour or so.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:37.520
But let me just describe Alan's solution. Alan's solution to these problems is indeed a solution.

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:42.520
No one will like it very much because it's more complicated than what they like to see.

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:53.520
But the solution goes like this. You can't say John does Mary at time t because that's a three place relation.

01:33:53.520 --> 01:34:00.520
But if you define a new relation called loves at some time.

01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:12.520
And another universe, another new relation called loves at all time, then you can say John loves Mary at all times and that's a two place relation.

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:18.520
Loves at all times is a two place relation. John and Mary are the two places fillers.

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:27.520
And John loves Mary sometimes is also a two place relation where John and Mary fill the two places in loves at all times.

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:40.520
Now you can generalize that you can generalize it to include John loves Mary at all times when the lights are switched on or when the grandmother is aware of you can generalize it but it gets more complicated.

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:54.520
And so no one likes it. And so Alan is working with John Beverly and with other people on finding a solution to this temporary relation problem that everyone will be happy with.

01:34:54.520 --> 01:35:05.520
Now, the old version, before we deleted some of the relations in this inspection version worked.

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:13.520
So it had logical, small logical time bombs, small time loss built in, but it worked.

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:17.520
No one noticed. No one had examples where these time bombs made any difference.

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:22.520
Very hard to find examples where these time bombs make a difference and they're usually quite artificial.

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:34.520
So it's not a big problem in the practical sense. It's only a problem in the logical sense. If we want to get the logic right, we have to address temporalized relations.

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:40.520
So I'm not going to say anything more about that. I'm just filling you in on what goes on behind the scenes.

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:52.520
The piece that John Beverly will talk about in a few minutes is logically in good shape and it's also practically in good shape and the sense that you can understand it quite quickly and it seems natural.

01:35:52.520 --> 01:36:02.520
All right. So now summary on BFO. I seem to remember that I have 200 slides here. So I'm not going to finish.

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:11.520
So BFO is very small. It evolves slowly. It has an active user forum. It has a really large user base and there are lots of people who know how to use it.

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:20.520
And we've seen the examples of suites. We've seen the Common Core ontologies. We've seen the principles. Talked about this already. I don't want to do all of this again.

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:28.520
This is more about the dates when these decisions were made. I keep repeating this. I must like it.

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:36.520
And this is one more piece that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has approved recommending BFO as the standard.

01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:45.520
And the problem is if you work with the intelligence community, you can't always know what they're doing and they can't always know what to do.

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:58.520
But he's created a space where ontologies can be developed with all the classification rules in place and maintained by people who know what they're doing.

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:06.520
And now the final piece in this puzzle is that Ryan Rikuchi over here, put your hand up, Ryan.

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:19.520
Ryan Rikuchi is in charge of a working group in the Department of Homeland Security to do for the Department of Homeland Security, which is, I don't know, 32 agencies or something like that.

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:30.520
What the DoDIC ontology working group is doing for the Department of Defense and the intelligence community. And he knows what he's talking about and he's very effective.

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:41.520
And E2 is going to be using BFO and it's going to be covering areas like infrastructure, cyber security and so forth. Do you want to add anything?

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:44.520
You might as well.

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:58.520
Well, I would say that we have two successful test events. We're working prototype for surveillance-enabled pattern recognition for sensors to be able to detect and reason autonomously about things in the air and take out,

01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:09.520
human-in-a-loop tasks and then automate analyst queries for the routine things. We don't want to ask again and again that we can use computers to do instead of people because people are prone to error and so on.

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:18.520
And the second thing that we have going, we have five different ontology lines of effort that are not just thinking about it or talking about it. We're off the whiteboard into practical application.

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:32.520
And the second thing is working out in person-centric ontology so we can reason about the different types of people that come into our care to automate determining what they're entitled for resources and how we consume resources to then inform a classic optimization problem.

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:41.520
What to do with people in the walk order with the transportation logistics and self-capacities and medical care to treat people as expeditiously safe and humanely as possible.

01:38:41.520 --> 01:39:00.520
So those are the type of problems that we're working on, time out with practical applications that we want to extend and then across the agency we're thinking about how to go about the next making sense of this big conglomeration of agencies that all have overlapping missions but very unique roles and we share work and leverage the virtuous cycle of development.

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:01.520
Thanks very much.

01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:07.520
I will be here till the end of these two weeks.

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:17.520
So he's already given, I was going to say take away two of my students by giving them jobs.

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:34.520
The way of viewing an ontology is that it's a computable lexicon. So a lot of what I've been talking about is getting people in different groups to use terms consistently, which means to use terms that have definitions which people share.

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:51.520
And the terms are almost, no, I was in very many cases, ordinary terms that ordinary people understand. In biology you have, you very quickly move into very technical terms, but even there they are terms which ordinary biologists understand.

01:39:51.520 --> 01:40:20.520
And this is one big difference between ontology and databases. So if ontology is a regulation of the lexicon and if the lexicon changes rather slowly, then that means that you can find in ontology a kind of infrastructure which will last for many years as long as

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:32.520
people who use those terms in that way last databases on the other hand move very quickly, but database technology database hardware and database software changes very quickly.

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:47.520
And you can make up database codes and new database structures also rather easily, which means that it doesn't provide this kind of foundation over long periods of time, which we find if we look at the ordinary lexicon.

01:40:47.520 --> 01:41:04.520
So ontology tries to have the best of both worlds wants to have the kind of logical coherence that you find in database structures but conjoined with the kind of stability that you get from the lexicon.

01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:19.520
And then that is how ontologies get to be used in large enterprises, including the Department of Defense. In large enterprises currently where data models dominate of one sort or another, the data models that people understand in one

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:34.520
enterprise will be completely unintelligible to data models used by people in such to the users of data model from other parts of the enterprise and every large enterprise data manager realizes these problems.

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:53.520
The Department of Defense realizes them. And that's one of the reasons for the tiny enthusiasm that they'd be begun to show about introducing ontology. I mean, in the Department of Homeland Security, there is a lot of enthusiasm, but in the Department of Defense, it's taken 12 years to get where we are.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:42:14.520
All right. Now, so we solve the failures of interoperability across large organizations by introducing terminological consistency. So common terms used consistently with common definitions, both in natural language, not dictionary definitions, but form but semi formal natural

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:40.520
definitions and then logical definitions in logical languages like our own and first order logic, for instance. And so I've said something about this. Now, let's look at definitions, which is the important part. Now, if you look at definitions, and this is true in many, many highly reputable organizations, they are really impressingly bad.

01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:58.520
They don't really know what a definition is commonly. So they're worse than dictionary definition. But look at many of the W3C publications and see what they, how they define basic words. So RDF, Army's resource.

01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:10.520
Look at what, look at the definition of resource in the official RBS specification. It's not, it doesn't tell you anything. Maybe because the word resource is not meant to tell you.

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:25.520
All right. So we want formal definitions for computer reasoning and we want natural language definitions for human use. And in both cases, we want real definitions. Now, what is a real definition?

01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:36.520
Well, it, I'm talking now about definitions for the terms in the ontology, not for the relations. In other words, not for the object, just for the terms in the is a hierarchy.

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:46.520
Definitions should be each definition should be a statement of individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions.

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:59.520
Now, what does that mean? Well, look at the definition for a triangle at the bottom here. A triangle is a closed figure. It has exactly three sides. Each of these sizes straight and it lies in a plane.

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:08.520
It may be that we have too much here, but we can simplify it a little bit. But all of these are necessary.

01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:16.520
In other words, every triangle is a closed figure. It is necessary of a triangle that it is a closed figure.

01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:26.520
And all of them together are jointly sufficient. That is to say anything which satisfies everything on the right hand side is a triangle.

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:33.520
Now, this is what a definition should look like how to build definitions like this is coming next.

01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:47.520
So this is a slightly simplified version of what we had before. And now here we have a certain form X is a triangle means X is a closed figure, which.

01:44:48.520 --> 01:45:07.520
And now we can assume that a closed figure is going to be the parent of triangle in the backbone taxonomy of geometrical figures, along with square and the other ones rectangle circle.

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:09.520
They're all closed figures.

01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:21.520
Now that's the key to a good definition. A good definition is a definition which specifies of its parent term.

01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:32.520
What are the necessary features that an instance of that parent term has to have if it's going to be an instance of the term on the left.

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:34.520
So I'll repeat that.

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:38.520
I won't. I will repeat it in a minute.

01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:48.520
So in the philosophical position, the which clause is called the specific difference.

01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:55.520
The term that you're defining is called the species and the parent term is called the genus.

01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:04.520
An example would be human being is defined as an animal.

01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:08.520
That's the parent term, which is rational.

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:11.520
That's what Aristotle said.

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:23.520
Every definition should be an Aristotelian definition in just that sense when it's a definition of a term, except now we come to the the following issue.

01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:40.520
Namely, there are some terms which are just so basic that you can't specify a parent term that would give you any additional meaning in the way in which human is a rational animal gives you additional meaning to the term animal.

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:48.520
Or triangle is a closed figure, which has exactly three sides, gives you additional meaning to closed figure.

01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:49.520
You can't do that with object.

01:46:49.520 --> 01:47:02.520
I can't explain what an object is by telling you that it's a thing which is object or thing which is connected or an entity which just one object is too basic.

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:14.520
And so every ontology is going to have primitive terms, which cannot be defined, and they will come at the very top of the relevant or near the very top of the relevant ontology tree, the back bone taxonomy.

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:26.520
And it's not that we are completely dumb or dumbfounded when it comes to primitive terms, but we can only provide what we call elucidations.

01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:28.520
They're not definitions.

01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:36.520
They are just necessary conditions, plus maybe some examples of how the term is to be used.

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:39.520
All right, now this is the recipe.

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:49.520
For a good definition, you have a parent term, you have the term you want to define, which is B in this case, and you have the specific difference, which is C.

01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:54.520
And then you define B as an A which sees.

01:47:54.520 --> 01:48:07.520
And this is, it's such a simple approach, but 99% of the definitions in otherwise highly reputable ontologies do not use this recipe.

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:16.520
And the recipe has the neat consequence that writing definitions is a good check on the quality of your taxonomy.

01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:24.520
But also the taxonomy that you're building is a good step towards creating good definitions for the terms it contains.

01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:29.520
So you, in principle, you get the best of both worlds.

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:33.520
All right, and now it doesn't work. That's the problem.

01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:38.520
It doesn't work in every case, but this too is not necessarily a bad thing.

01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.520
So this is the Aristotle example.

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:41.520
This is what we want.

01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:44.520
We want our trees to look like this.

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:56.520
Every term or every class in the is a taxonomy has exactly one parent except for the very highest classes, which don't have any.

01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:06.520
As long as every class has exactly one parent, we can use the Aristotelian rule for definitions without any problems.

01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:12.520
But some, some people build ontologies and they have diamonds in them.

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:16.520
And by that, I do not mean diamonds in the rough.

01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:24.520
I mean diamonds, which cause the rough and and the Department of Homeland Security has ontologies, which are full of diamonds.

01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:29.520
And no, actually, which are suspiciously many times.

01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:34.520
And so a dam is a water asset, but it's also an electric power asset.

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:36.520
Now, that's not quite true.

01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:40.520
Not every dam is an electric power asset.

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:46.520
And so we have, we can easily chop away this one and just have water asset.

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:48.520
Every dam is a water asset.

01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:56.520
And that's another general rule in good ontology building is always means every.

01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:59.520
So if you say a is a B, you mean every a is a B.

01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:02.520
If you say a is part of B, it's slightly different.

01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:10.520
If you say a is part of B, you mean every a is part of some B.

01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:21.520
And if you say a has part B, you mean every a is such that there is some B, which is a part of it.

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:31.520
And then the sum goes before a hidden instance of so a is part of B means every instance of a has some.

01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:35.520
It is part of some instance of B.

01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:37.520
This is called the all some rule.

01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:47.520
So if there is a, it's just all every for other relations for lateral relations is all some every a is part of some B.

01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:50.520
Every a is just adjacent to some B.

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:51.520
And so on.

01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:52.520
All right.

01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:57.520
Now, I think I'll just give you pictures of knowledge across.

01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:00.520
Oh, there's Ryan again.

01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:04.520
And more knowledge graphs.

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:13.520
And so knowledge graphs give you some of the benefits of ontology together with some of the benefits of databases.

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:29.520
Now, one of the reasons why the military in America and the AI part of the military in America are so interested in ontologies is because they think that on knowledge graphs are the way forward in collecting useful data.

01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:38.520
And to have well behaved knowledge perhaps it's very good to have coherently structured ontologies.

01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:43.520
And this is the physics part.

01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:51.520
I think I so should I finish with the physics part of the AI part.

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:53.520
I guess I'll do the physics part.

01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:58.520
So although I can't do physics in 13 minutes.

01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:03.520
So, since the beginning of BFO.

01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:08.520
And actually, you were doing something very similar with your snow med question.

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:16.520
I would receive requests from people that they needed a BFO conformant ontology of mathematics.

01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:20.520
And my response was, you don't need an ontology of mathematics.

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:22.520
You just go to the supermarket.

01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:23.520
You can get your money.

01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:24.520
It's already there.

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:25.520
It's all been done.

01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:26.520
There are no problems.

01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:34.520
And but now we need at least an ontology of units of measure.

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:55.520
And if we're going to understand quantum physics, I use the keyword, then we're going to have to understand the mathematics of quantum physics because there isn't really much that you can understand outside mathematics when you're trying to do quantum physics.

01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:59.520
I think that at the moment, maybe things will get better.

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:09.520
So we wrote this paper and I just mentioned that I co-authored with this man, Jobs Landkreber, a book which came out last year.

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:24.520
Basically the book about the ontology of systems, both simple systems such as the solar system and a laptop and complex systems such as your digestive system or the government of Ukraine.

01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:30.520
You can't predict the behaviors of complex systems for complex reasons, which we document in the book.

01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:37.520
And therefore you can't build a Turing machine which can emulate the behaviors of complex systems.

01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:50.520
And therefore artificial general intelligence, that is to say artificial intelligence, which would be equal in power or superior in power to human intelligence is impossible.

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:53.520
That's the argument of the book.

01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:59.520
All right, so in order to build a quantum physics ontology, we need to build a mathematics ontology.

01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:03.520
And mathematics is basically set theory.

01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:08.520
But understanding set theory ontologically is not trivial.

01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:11.520
And we didn't want everything to be set.

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:19.520
So we wanted there to be some things which are part of the object domain of mathematics, which are not sets.

01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:32.520
Because there has to be a starting point for building the set theoretic structures, which are the various kinds of structures which mathematicians like to deal with.

01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:35.520
And we call these things monads.

01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:41.520
And we give examples of monad zero on constant a variable and a geometric point.

01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:48.520
We're not very happy with this selection, but we are confident that there has to be something like monads.

01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:51.520
We're going to build coherent ontology mathematics.

01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:56.520
Everything else is set theory or everything else is what you need to get set theory off the ground.

01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:03.520
For instance, the set constructor, which takes a mathematical predicate and turns it into a set.

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:05.520
This is the structure corner.

01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:09.520
So this here is a function.

01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:12.520
Every mathematical function has this structure.

01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:15.520
Every mathematical operator has this structure.

01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:20.520
That's the field of real numbers and there are other fields of natural numbers and so forth.

01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:22.520
None of these things fit into BFO.

01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:27.520
What we're doing, and we have to do something like this, we have BFO.

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:32.520
We don't create math O as a child ontology BFO.

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:34.520
We create it as a sibling.

01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:37.520
And we have physics, which will be a sibling of math.

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:40.520
But there are some areas of overlap.

01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:46.520
So when it comes to physics, we have experiments and we have experimental results.

01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:51.520
They fall under BFO experiments are processes in the BFO send.

01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.520
So there are connections, even with the quantum world connection.

01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:01.520
All right, so these are functionals and operators.

01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:06.520
And now we already have some ontology to deal with some physics.

01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:09.520
These are just for, I'm sure that there are others.

01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:12.520
OB is already a BFO conformant ontology.

01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:15.520
The open energy ontology is BFO conformant.

01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:20.520
The physics based simulation ontology is very small, but it is also BFO conformant.

01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:25.520
And the ontology of physics for biology, it wants to be BFO conformant.

01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:28.520
So we may use some of the content here in due course.

01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:31.520
But for the moment, we're working on the fundamental.

01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:33.520
And this is where systems come in.

01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:39.520
So systems form the heart of the AI book, simple systems and complex systems.

01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:43.520
And we think that there are three important kinds of physics entity.

01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:48.520
In other words, important in the sense that we believe that if we get three kinds of entity right,

01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:55.520
then we will have dealt with all of the important kinds of entities in the realm of physics.

01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:57.520
System entities are three kinds.

01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:59.520
They're a system element.

01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:03.520
When it says weight here, it does not mean the measurement weight.

01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:07.520
It means that an actual lump of metal used with a weight.

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:11.520
And so we have elements such as weights or people or planets.

01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:13.520
Planets are parts of systems.

01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:19.520
Then we have interactions between these elements such as electromagnetic interaction or gravity.

01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:27.520
And then we have the system itself, which is in the case we had in mind in the paper, is a weight on a spring.

01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:30.520
So the harmonic oscillator, you have a spring and you have a weight.

01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:33.520
And the weight goes up and down harmonically.

01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:37.520
And the harmonic oscillator is a very important physical system,

01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:40.520
which is found also in biology and chemistry everywhere,

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:47.520
and which we document in the paper ontologically as our example of classical physics.

01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:49.520
And then we have magnitudes.

01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:51.520
This was always a very hard problem.

01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:58.520
And we still haven't corrected completely for BFO how to understand things like velocity or acceleration.

01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:04.520
Because for complex reasons, BFO only allows continuance to have quality.

01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:11.520
It doesn't allow qualities of processing and velocity sound like the quality of a process.

01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:15.520
And so we just introduced the idea of a process.

01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:17.520
We don't call it a process quality.

01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:19.520
We call it a process factoristic.

01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:23.520
That is a term which was already being used by the Eauble foundry.

01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:27.520
And acceleration would be an example of a process characteristic.

01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:30.520
And I think what we're doing here is pretty coherent.

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:34.520
It's not rocket science, but it's at least coherent.

01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:38.520
And then finally, we have models.

01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:41.520
And this brings it back to the oscillator.

01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:45.520
So if you have a spring and you have a weight at the end of spring,

01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:47.520
you pull the weight, it will vibrate for a while.

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:50.520
And then because of friction, it will come to rest.

01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:53.520
That's a real thing, a real process.

01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:56.520
But physics doesn't describe real processes.

01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:03.520
Physics describes idealized, even mathematicized counterparts of those real processes.

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:08.520
So a force oscillated with dampening is never realized in the real world.

01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:17.520
Just as the mathematical closed figure called a circle is never realized in the real world.

01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:19.520
There are no circles.

01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:23.520
Meaning there are no perfect circles in the mathematical sense.

01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:26.520
And similarly, there are no force oscillators.

01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:33.520
What we mean by force oscillator, the idealized case described by the equations of physics.

01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:37.520
So models are important because they describe the idealization.

01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:43.520
And now we do experiments in order to work out whether these idealizations in fact capture reality.

01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:47.520
And if they do, we get our little green badge and we're a physicist.

01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:51.520
And if they don't, we go back to work to do more experiments.

01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:59.520
So models on this view are essential features of physics because physics deals not with reality, but with models.

01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:00.520
All right.

02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:02.520
And so, well, we've seen all of that.

02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:05.520
These are some examples of systems.

02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:13.520
So systems, simple systems like these are such that the system behavior can be predicted using classical physics.

02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:18.520
And so the behavior of simple systems may be church during computable.

02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:30.520
In other words, it may be that we can have computer can emulate the simple system, but complex systems are not going to be emulated by a machine.

02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:34.520
And these are the, these are some examples of complex systems.

02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:38.520
And the New York Stock Exchange.

02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:40.520
And this is the book again.

02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:43.520
And then now we're back to physics.

02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:46.520
So magnitudes in classical physics are described here.

02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:49.520
And I don't have time to go through this.

02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:52.520
This is our ontology of magnitudes.

02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:53.520
Oh, sorry.

02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:57.520
This is what we had before just with examples that you can read now.

02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:03.520
This is more on models, what models are, how we build them.

02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:06.520
The models are built by people.

02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:11.520
And that's all classical physics, roughly pre 1906.

02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:16.520
Modern physics is general relativity theory plus quantum physics.

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:26.520
And the heart of quantum physics anyway is the idea of a Hilbert space, which we can already fit into our original mathematics ontology.

02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:38.520
So a Hilbert space is a sub kind of the kind metric space, which is sub kind of the kind vector space, which is a sub kind of the kind algebraic structure, which is a sub kind of the kind structure, all of that is in the mathematics ontology.

02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:41.520
And you can't do quantum physics without physics.

02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:47.520
And, well, this is more, you can't do quantum physics without the idea of inner product.

02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:51.520
And without the idea of operators and projectors and so on.

02:01:51.520 --> 02:02:00.520
And so the Feynman said, if you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics.

02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:07.520
They say, in fact, I think what he really said was this, that we can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.

02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:10.520
Now, what did he mean?

02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:12.520
So what are the domains which we can understand?

02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:15.520
Now, I think we can understand the domain of mathematics.

02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:17.520
Mathematicians understand mathematics.

02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:19.520
There's no mystery about that.

02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:22.520
They build it and they understand.

02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:26.520
What else can we understand apart from mathematics?

02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:33.520
Answer is the domain of everything which falls under BFO.

02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:35.520
That's it.

02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:40.520
And so that's why we can't understand quantum mechanics because it doesn't fall under BFO.

02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:44.520
And so some mathematics common sense.

02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:47.520
So what is the common sense domain?

02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:50.520
Now, we didn't make this up.

02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:53.520
There is a certain amount of theory on common sense.

02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:56.520
It goes under the name primary theory.

02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:05.520
Primary, and this actually gets deep into the heart of ISOIC to want to create that too.

02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:09.520
Robin Horton was an anthropologist who lived in Africa.

02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:11.520
I think he was born in Africa.

02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:18.520
He worked on the worldviews of different cultures, both Western and non-Western.

02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:24.520
And he decided that there were two kinds of worldviews which you can formulate as theories.

02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:35.520
One is primary theory and that is a theory which is about the common sense world.

02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:42.520
The boats and snowballs and leaves and food and drinks and so on.

02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:48.520
The things that you need in order to survive and behave in an everyday world.

02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:56.520
And then secondary theory are theories which you only find in one culture or another which are not shared by every culture.

02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:09.520
Examples of secondary theory would be quantum mechanics, Catholicism, Pythagoreans, which is the view that everything is made of nuns.

02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:14.520
Panpsychism, which is the view that everything in the universe is conscious.

02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:18.520
And solipsism, which is the view that only I exist.

02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:21.520
All of these are secondary theories.

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:26.520
And now primary theory, common sense, is definable.

02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:29.520
It's that which all cultures share.

02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:35.520
And that is, roughly speaking, what you find in BFO, roughly speaking.

02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:37.520
Mathematics is in the one side of...

02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:40.520
Well, little bits of mathematics, but not much.

02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:44.520
There are some cultures which are very small amounts of mathematics.

02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:47.520
And so it goes like this.

02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:49.520
You can study this while we...

02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:52.520
Can we see if we can contact John?

02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:54.520
He should by now be...

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:56.520
Oh, I'm here.

02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:57.520
So that's John.

02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:58.520
No, fine.

02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.520
Yeah, this is...

02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:00.520
Hi, I'm John.

02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:02.520
Well, let me find the slides for...

02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:03.520
Here we go.

02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:04.520
Hi, everybody.

02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:06.520
John Beverly, that's me at the top.

02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:07.520
And also on your screen.

02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:12.520
I'm going to be talking today about implementations of BFO.

02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:16.520
Because there's sometimes some confusion about the difference between BFOs

02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:22.520
used as a broad data model and BFO in its actual, you know, everyday hour.

02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:26.520
And so I'm here to shed some light and illuminate that.

02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:30.520
As you see, John Beverly, professor at the University of Buffalo,

02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:34.520
colleague of Barry's, speaking here in capacity,

02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:37.520
VP for the National Center of Ontological Research

02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:40.520
and representative of the BFO community.

02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:41.520
So here's what we'll do.

02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:45.520
I'm going to talk about BFO ontology repo updates,

02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:48.520
repo, a GitHub repo, because we have a lot of our...

02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:50.520
We have our artifacts on a GitHub repo.

02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:54.520
I'll also talk about clarification around some implementations of BFO,

02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:56.520
what it means to implement BFO.

02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:57.520
I'll do this real quick.

02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:59.520
I know you guys probably want to go eat some pizza.

02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:00.520
I saw the schedules pizza day.

02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:02.520
I won't keep you from it.

02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:06.520
Then we'll talk about a core BFO file and then temporal extensions.

02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:08.520
And this is where it's going to get interesting.

02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:10.520
So if you know anything about BFO,

02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:13.520
you can probably already tell why it's going to be interesting.

02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:16.520
And if you don't, well, hold on to your horses.

02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:17.520
Okay. Here we go.

02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:18.520
Clarifications.

02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:21.520
So there has been some confusion concerning which BFO file

02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:23.520
and the repo folks should use.

02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:25.520
And that, that makes sense.

02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:26.520
If you go to the GitHub repo,

02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:29.520
I have a screenshot of what it used to look like over there,

02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:30.520
right here on the right.

02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:31.520
It's a little confusing.

02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:35.520
You got the 21838-2, definitely ISO.

02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:37.520
Good reference to ISO.

02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:40.520
But you also see file or directories like common logic model

02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:44.520
and a bunch of the files in different formats named BFO.

02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:46.520
It's a little hard to parse sometimes.

02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:47.520
Not the best documentation.

02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:48.520
This is not knocking Alan.

02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:49.520
I love Alan.

02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:51.520
Alan did amazing work, but you know,

02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:52.520
documentation is important.

02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:55.520
So we're clarifying, cleaning this up.

02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:58.520
So here's, here's the new structure.

02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:00.520
And I'll walk through it real quick.

02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:04.520
The development team, myself included work to clear this up

02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:05.520
that is easier to understand.

02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:06.520
It's on a fork right now.

02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:08.520
I'm going to merge it shortly,

02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:10.520
but here's the structure over on the right.

02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:11.520
It should be clear.

02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:14.520
And if it's not, hold on.

02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:19.520
So we know that BFO is described in the standard

02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:21.520
and described in this building ontology,

02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:23.520
the basic formal ontology book,

02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:26.520
describes a theory that outstrips the,

02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:30.520
the, the expressivity of owl, right?

02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:32.520
Which is what we typically use when we,

02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:35.520
we're dealing with BFO or any ontologies, really.

02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:40.520
So there, there are lots of different implementations of BFO.

02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:44.520
Some of which more accurately, accurately represent or reflect

02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:47.520
that broader model that is described in that,

02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:49.520
the ISO standard in the text, right?

02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:52.520
Common logic is one implementation of it.

02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:53.520
It's a formal language.

02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:54.520
It's a fan.

02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:55.520
It's, I think it's actually Cliff,

02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:58.520
but it's a representative and one of among your family

02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:02.520
for first order logics that's used in computational reasoning.

02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:03.520
First order logic.

02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:07.520
This is a rather, a rather clearer, I would say,

02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:11.520
if I had to measure a clear representation of first order logic

02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:14.520
in this syntax, common logics, a little tough to parse,

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.520
usually used for documentation.

02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:20.520
L-A-D-R, this is a less known syntax,

02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:22.520
the library for automated deduction research.

02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:24.520
This is used in model checking,

02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:26.520
in particular with MACE for improver nine,

02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:30.520
which Alan Ruttenberg had used to generate the consistency proof

02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:32.520
for the broader theory.

02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:34.520
Just, just pointing at these,

02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:38.520
you probably don't care that much unless you're a nerd about logic like I am,

02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:43.520
but what you're probably more interested in is this OWL file here.

02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:46.520
So, so this is what folks typically mean,

02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:48.520
or when they're talking about BFO in the wild,

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:51.520
they want to, they want to focus on this specific file.

02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:54.520
So here, here's the updates, guys.

02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:56.520
Okay, okay, calm down.

02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:57.520
I see you're too excited.

02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:58.520
Let's relax.

02:08:58.520 --> 02:08:59.520
Okay, here's the updates.

02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:04.520
So over here, the BFO implementation in OWL,

02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:06.520
we're switching the name.

02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:07.520
It's the core file.

02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:10.520
Now BFO core OWL, and it,

02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:13.520
it's switched from the previous file name,

02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:15.520
which was not, wasn't the,

02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:19.520
wasn't the full, full gamut of temporal and space and time and all that,

02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:23.520
but it was called the BFO 2020 without some all times dot OWL file.

02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:27.520
And this was basically all the classes, all the relations, et cetera,

02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:33.520
but without the all and sometimes object properties.

02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:36.520
Okay, so this, you see here, this again,

02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:41.520
all the BFO classes in the 21A, or 21A38-2,

02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:46.520
and all the binary relations that do not require a third index for time.

02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:47.520
That's the important part.

02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:48.520
Okay.

02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:49.520
Why?

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:51.520
To remain computationally tractable.

02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:55.520
OWL doesn't permit representing relations that hold between more than two things.

02:09:55.520 --> 02:10:00.520
I assume you know that, but if not, blow in your mind, right?

02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:02.520
John is next to Sally, fine and OWL.

02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:05.520
John has armnet on Tuesday, not fine and OWL.

02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:06.520
We can't represent that.

02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:10.520
So representing time with only binary relations has been a persistent challenge

02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:13.520
for the ontology community in general.

02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:18.520
We have been working on this, on attempts to, to represent this information.

02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:24.520
One of those attempts was Allen's temporalized relations strategy.

02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:25.520
There are others.

02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:28.520
There's, for instance, the Common Quarantology Suite,

02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:32.520
and their team has developed an approach to this, this model,

02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:36.520
a set of modeling patterns that kind of revolves around Stacey's,

02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:40.520
which is like unchanging dependent continuance over time

02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:42.520
that are related to histories and whatnot.

02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:45.520
So here's some examples, temporalized relations,

02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:49.520
location of at all times, located in at all times, the inverse.

02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:52.520
You also have some times versions of these.

02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:56.520
On the other hand, Stacey's, you just kind of get to use the same object properties

02:10:56.520 --> 02:10:58.520
that you would see in the relations ontology, for instance,

02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:03.520
location of and located in just with some more formal structure somewhere else

02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:05.520
in your design pattern.

02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:11.520
So temporalized relations, that strategy that was, that Allen developed,

02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:14.520
it provides a semantically rich representation of time

02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:17.520
and it does support sophisticated reasoning about time,

02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:20.520
but it's hard to use, real hard to use.

02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:24.520
Folks at a challenging time, like just, just trying to figure out when

02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:27.520
located in at all times holds versus located in at some times.

02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:30.520
And I can tell you, having worked in industry with folks,

02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:34.520
subject matter experts who would, you know, task to represent stuff

02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:37.520
with ontologies or like their domain with ontology,

02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:41.520
they would typically just defer to using the sometimes relation

02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:46.520
because it's the weakest and because they wouldn't know when all times held,

02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:49.520
like when is something a part of something else at all times,

02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:53.520
harder to say than when something is a part of something else at some times.

02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:56.520
The problem is sometimes is, is logically weak.

02:11:56.520 --> 02:11:58.520
It says almost nothing.

02:11:58.520 --> 02:11:59.520
You don't get transitivity.

02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:01.520
You don't, you don't get much, right?

02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:03.520
It's just basically a tag.

02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:05.520
The stasis approach developed by CCO,

02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:09.520
it provides a semantically weak or weaker version of representation of time,

02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:13.520
but it is easier to deploy and there are fewer mistakes and users have another

02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:16.520
easier time understanding how to use it.

02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:21.520
This is not just motivated by like practical considerations of users,

02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:25.520
though, like sometimes some domains, I mean, domains do treat time differently.

02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:29.520
Economists treat time as discrete physicists that continuous and some don't

02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:31.520
even treat time at all.

02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:35.520
Not all domains need require semantically rich representations of time.

02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:38.520
Like a lot of folks in the logo foundry, for instance,

02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:42.520
use disease ontologies to just tag articles with terms and dates.

02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:45.520
They just do not need that kind of robot.

02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:49.520
I mean, maybe in an ideal world, if they were really using reasoning over,

02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:52.520
over these sorts of temporal structures, they, you know,

02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:55.520
they would need this kind of robust semantics, but they don't.

02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:56.520
They just kind of tack stuff.

02:12:56.520 --> 02:13:00.520
So it's a lot, it's, it's a lot of work to get the time right.

02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:04.520
So they're not interested in doing that, especially for their specifically for

02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:05.520
their use cases.

02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:09.520
Now other, other foundries do need this corner representation of time.

02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:13.520
The industrial ontology foundry terms, they use temporalized relations.

02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:18.520
They need this semantic, this ability to reason more than just tagging data or

02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:20.520
date or terms and date times.

02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:23.520
They need that semantic structure that can run reasoners over when they're

02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:27.520
handling manufacturing and engineering content.

02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:28.520
Okay.

02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:33.520
So upshot here that temporalized relations strategy.

02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:38.520
The thing with the all times and the sometimes that was previously part of

02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:40.520
the approved version of BFO owl.

02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:45.520
So that was like, when you use, when you were in conformance with BFO,

02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:49.520
you were you, and you were using the owl file, you had to use that one.

02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:50.520
Again, tough.

02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:52.520
People used it incorrectly.

02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:53.520
Got a lot of pushback.

02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:56.520
We're taking a more flexible approach now.

02:13:56.520 --> 02:13:59.520
Now we are backing up a little and saying, depending on your use case,

02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:03.520
depending on your domain, you might need that not might not need that robust

02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:04.520
theory of time.

02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:08.520
You could also use Stacey's and potentially other extensions.

02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:12.520
We'll call them temporal extensions of the BFO core.

02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:17.520
But you are not necessarily required to use the temporalized relations version.

02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:20.520
You are required to use one of the extensions.

02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:24.520
Not just not, not a specific one.

02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:31.520
So roughly speaking, or broadly speaking, then the core implementation of BFO and owl

02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:36.520
is agnostic about representations of time that require more than binary relations.

02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:40.520
So as you see over here in the right hand side, this, this is, this is the core.

02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:42.520
These are the core relations.

02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:44.520
You see this in the BFO core file.

02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:47.520
They do not require reference to time.

02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:50.520
Some of them are temporal, but they don't require a third index.

02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:56.520
The temporal extensions of the core implementation of BFO, such as the temporalized relations

02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:01.520
extension or the stasis extension, they provide representations of time which users can select

02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:03.520
based on, from based on their needs.

02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:04.520
So here are some examples.

02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:07.520
You should see the temporalized relations on the right.

02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:11.520
Aero pointing up is carry of it sometime carrier of it all times, et cetera.

02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:15.520
Same for Stacey's you have generically depends on has part has member.

02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:21.520
And again, the structure, the temporal structure there for Stacey's is it's, it's the semantics

02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:25.520
of some, it's weaker than the temporalized relations representation.

02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:28.520
There is additional structure for the Stacey's stuff.

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:32.520
It's just not built into the object property, the way the temporalized relations is it's

02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:37.520
somewhere else is relying on like histories and this, this class called stasis.

02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:44.520
So temporal extensions of the BFO core, they will import BFO core owl and add relations

02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:49.520
for the purposes of representing relations holding at times and conformance to BFO now

02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:54.520
requires using that core, of course, which nobody has problem with, and at least one

02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:56.520
of those temporal extensions.

02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:03.520
And then this is important because users deploying BFO can largely do so as they have.

02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:08.520
So if you are using temporalized relations continue, if you are not, if you are using

02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:15.520
something like RO, which CCO, the common core ontologies, which those are the developers

02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:17.520
stasis, they are, they use RO too.

02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:22.520
So if you are using those, and you are wanting to stay conformant with BFO, if you adopt

02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:28.520
what, what the CCO, what CCO is doing with those RO relations, you will also be in conformance

02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:33.520
with BFO, because you will in that way be adopting that temporal extension.

02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:40.520
So in addition, lastly, the BFO development team will create mappings across these extensions.

02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:46.520
So that is to say in this case between stasis and the temporalized relations, so that you

02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:52.520
don't have drift of uses, like we don't want people like one group to use this temporalized

02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:54.520
extension and another group to use another one.

02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:57.520
And then they go off and do their modeling, and then they're not interoperable.

02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:02.520
So we're creating mappings between them so that it really is, you know, choose, choose

02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:07.520
your own adventure sort of situation and we'll, we'll map them together in the, in the back

02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:08.520
end.

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:09.520
All right.

02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:15.520
So in summary, core BFO file taxonomy specified in 21, 8, 3, 8, 2, and relations that don't

02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:21.520
require temporal indexing extension, temporal extensions, import that core adding relations

02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:25.520
that provide richer representations of time, some more rich than others in the development

02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:29.520
team will provide guidance for selecting the temporal extension based on need and will

02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:33.520
secure interoperability across extensions via mapping.

02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:34.520
Look at that.

02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:40.520
I did it and I have what, seven minutes left.

02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:42.520
Can you hear me, John?

02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:43.520
I can.

02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:46.520
So you better explain what RO is.

02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:49.520
Oh, I thought you already did it.

02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:50.520
It's the relations ontology.

02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:56.520
So relations ontology is a large number of ontology or a large number of object properties

02:17:56.520 --> 02:18:02.520
that are used very often used by oboe foundry ontologies.

02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:08.520
So they have things they include a lot of proper object properties like part of, but

02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:16.520
they also have some more specific object properties for biological phenomena like, I don't know

02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:21.520
what's a biology term, his titrate or something.

02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:22.520
What's that?

02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:24.520
Spider's leg.

02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:25.520
Spider's leg.

02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:26.520
Spider's leg.

02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:27.520
Spider's leg.

02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:28.520
Yeah.

02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:36.520
Was there anything, any other clarifications?

02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:37.520
I ran through that quick.

02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:45.520
I didn't want to get in the way of you and Pete.

02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:46.520
Yeah.

02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:47.520
Go ahead.

02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:52.520
I guess I need to control the audience.

02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:55.520
So we'll start over there.

02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:59.520
Are you going to question if a new vehicle goes over the oboe foundry?

02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:04.520
Because you have seen a vehicle, too, and a written number of it.

02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:07.520
I think that's the one that you thought.

02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:08.520
Shall I do that one?

02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:09.520
I couldn't hear him.

02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:10.520
So yeah.

02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:11.520
Okay.

02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:17.520
So the question is, are we going to bring these goodies to the oboe foundry?

02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:19.520
Three wise men.

02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:22.520
I mean, you're going to try.

02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:23.520
I'm trying.

02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:25.520
I've been talking to Chris.

02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:29.520
I was talking to Chris the other day, trying to, like, just, you know, finesse a little

02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:30.520
bit.

02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:32.520
We got to go through the, we got to go through the process of like vetting.

02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:33.520
Like that's his big thing.

02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:34.520
And I understand.

02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:35.520
So yeah.

02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:41.520
Complete what John just describes convincingly and then take it to the other country.

02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:46.520
So there are members of the oboe foundry who I would like the whole foundry to be running

02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:48.520
on both all the logic.

02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:51.520
And in the first of the logic, you don't have any problems.

02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:52.520
They all go away.

02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:59.520
And that in a way, that's my dream of.

02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:00.520
Yeah.

02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:03.520
Thank you for that clarification.

02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:09.520
What I do find a pity, however, is that in this new version, you have the so-called

02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:13.520
temporary relations because they are not temporary relations.

02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:19.520
They are, they're in labor only, but they cannot actually be admitted what you think

02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:21.520
you are representing.

02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:23.520
Because you need the temporal logic for that.

02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:26.520
It's a labor lane work allowance.

02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:29.520
That actually having a temporal logic.

02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:35.520
There are, it's a central extension to our, if you don't want to go to the group first

02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:41.520
or the logic for instance, there are alternatives to being almost to what the label actually

02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:42.520
would mean.

02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:43.520
So yeah.

02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:47.520
I find it disappointing to see that that actually made it in there.

02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:52.520
Are you to convert into a question?

02:20:52.520 --> 02:21:01.520
Are you going to go to a powerful version that will be properly using a temporary logic

02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:06.520
so that you can do the actual reasoning with it and the consistency checking of what you

02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:09.520
think you are representing?

02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:14.520
I mean, I think ultimately we have to, I share your dissatisfaction.

02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:19.520
I mean, the temporalized relations, any representation of time, you go look at it, you can, you know,

02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:22.520
you got the restrictions of hour so strong.

02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:26.520
I mean, almost anything interesting is a non-simple property.

02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:28.520
Like suddenly you can't say much.

02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:31.520
Like we say, hey, I'm representing the Allen interval calculus.

02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:32.520
No, you're not.

02:21:32.520 --> 02:21:33.520
Hush.

02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:34.520
Not an hour.

02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:35.520
She can't.

02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:41.520
So like, I totally understand the first order logic though, we have that intense logic or temporal logic.

02:21:41.520 --> 02:21:43.520
We could represent the sorts of structures.

02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:48.520
I think ultimately we're going to have to because ultimately I think that sort of temporal reasoning

02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:57.520
or sophisticated temporal reasoning that hasn't really been a set like within use cases of ontology

02:21:57.520 --> 02:22:01.520
are becoming more and more necessary.

02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:06.520
Like the use cases that we're seeing now do want that kind of temporal reasoning.

02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:09.520
They do want that semantic rich representation.

02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:12.520
So we've been getting away for too long without it.

02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:15.520
We have to appeal to some more tools.

02:22:15.520 --> 02:22:18.520
So some folks have been working like Fabian.

02:22:18.520 --> 02:22:20.520
I'm not sure Fabian's here.

02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:34.520
Fabian has, Neuhaus has been developing some, some tools that are allow you kind of put kind of to put first order logic axioms on top of some owl axioms and, you know, generate a combine them,

02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:38.520
generate a model and prove some theorems using vampire in that setting.

02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:43.520
And then I think maybe there allows for a conversion back in the owl some to some extent.

02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:44.520
I'm not sure.

02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:46.520
So there's some research in that direction.

02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:53.520
I myself have been trying to finesse shackle in combination with owl.

02:22:53.520 --> 02:23:07.520
So using the expressivity of shackle with, you know, because it can also use sparkle with embedded within its shapes to try to maybe approach or get make some more progress towards representing temporal logic.

02:23:07.520 --> 02:23:09.520
Really just work in progress.
