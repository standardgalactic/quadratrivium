00:00.000 --> 00:07.280
Good afternoon everybody. Bienvenue Ã  tous. My name is David Eidelman. I'm Vice Principal

00:07.280 --> 00:11.840
Health Affairs and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and it's my pleasure

00:11.840 --> 00:16.720
to welcome you all to a session on Healthcare in Deep Space, Autonomous Medicine Practical

00:16.720 --> 00:22.480
AI in Advanced Simulation. This is the session's part of McGill Space Week as you know and it's

00:22.480 --> 00:28.800
a signature event of McGill's bicentennial celebrations. You know, we just heard about AI,

00:28.800 --> 00:34.320
we heard about the application of existing technologies and we heard about complexity

00:35.120 --> 00:41.520
and space missions obviously are the prototype of highly complex systems operating in an

00:41.520 --> 00:47.520
environment in which you have to handle lots of heterogeneous data and information sets and in

00:47.520 --> 00:53.920
order to be successful in spaceflight you have to figure out how to do this and to do that you need

00:53.920 --> 00:58.400
to really know what you're talking about and there you know Professor Smith's going to describe

00:58.400 --> 01:04.720
the foundational principles necessary to integrate all aspects of complex systems including emission

01:04.720 --> 01:11.360
systems using biologic and other data and into an information architecture that really supports the

01:11.360 --> 01:19.280
use of advanced modular algorithms and so Professor Smith the floor is yours. I'm going to transfer

01:19.280 --> 01:27.520
over take it away. Good so I'm not going to be able to do all of that but I will try and do at least

01:27.520 --> 01:35.760
some samples which will give you an idea of how it could be done and I'll start with some background so

01:35.760 --> 01:42.640
I started life as a philosopher working on metaphysics. Recently I started a whole new

01:43.840 --> 01:51.120
line of thinking. I'm about to publish a book with a German AI entrepreneur colleague of mine on

01:51.760 --> 01:58.480
artificial intelligence which more or less agrees with everything that Gary Marcus says

01:58.480 --> 02:06.000
in his book but takes it further so we try and document in great detail the limits of AI when

02:06.000 --> 02:13.040
dealing specifically with complex systems such as organisms and missions to Mars and so forth

02:13.600 --> 02:19.520
and if we've got time I may come back to show the relevance of that to the main topic here

02:20.240 --> 02:29.440
so which goes back to 2002 when I was awarded a prize to establish an institute in Germany to

02:29.440 --> 02:37.680
deal with the ontology of medicine and this prize was awarded because people working in

02:38.880 --> 02:45.440
computational ontology already then had started to use some of my ideas from philosophical ontology

02:46.080 --> 02:51.600
so I started the institute and the first thing I realized was that I was probably going to be

02:51.600 --> 02:58.400
spending the rest of my life studying one single ontology which was the gene ontology which John

02:58.400 --> 03:06.800
mentioned already. Gene ontology solved a very considerable problem namely the problem of making

03:06.800 --> 03:15.280
human genome and mouse genome and fly genome data useful for medicine and the idea was that the

03:15.280 --> 03:23.440
gene ontology provided a systematic semantically well-grounded common consensus terminology across

03:23.440 --> 03:32.240
all organisms and all disciplines which could be used to tag sequences whether they're gene sequences

03:32.240 --> 03:41.360
or protein sequences or any other kind of sequence and this was a great success it was

03:41.360 --> 03:48.480
brought to my attention very early on in working in this new institute and the first thing I realized

03:48.480 --> 03:56.720
about it was that it was full of mistakes and mistakes of a logical nature which a philosopher

03:56.800 --> 04:05.520
learns about in the first logic class at the beginning of their studies and so I had money for

04:05.520 --> 04:11.600
the new institute I invited the leadership of the gene ontology to come to the institute in Leipzig

04:13.120 --> 04:20.240
and I went through pointing out all the mistakes that they were making so this is just one example

04:20.240 --> 04:27.920
a lytic vacuole within a protein storage vacuole is classified by the gene ontology as a protein

04:27.920 --> 04:34.720
storage vacuole it was then this is a bit like saying that an embryo within a uterus is a uterus

04:34.720 --> 04:41.600
it's an ontological mistake of a very simple logical sort and in those days the gene ontology

04:41.600 --> 04:50.000
was full of such mistakes it was also doing the job of providing semantic definitions useful to humans

04:50.640 --> 04:56.080
in a in a way which involved similar kinds of mistakes so this is a circular definition

04:56.720 --> 05:01.360
it's not a good definition doesn't it doesn't and it cannot tell you anything about the meaning

05:01.360 --> 05:08.480
of hemolysis because the word is used in the definition so I presented a talk at the meeting

05:09.120 --> 05:16.160
in Leipzig entitled stop or smart terminology through ontological principles

05:16.160 --> 05:24.960
and the the head of the gene ontology initiative Michael Ashburner at the end of who was in the room

05:25.920 --> 05:31.680
on the front row smiling throughout he took me behind the curtain and he made a deal with me

05:31.680 --> 05:38.880
he said Barry I will put you in charge of the logic of the gene ontology and in return you

05:39.120 --> 05:47.040
promise never to criticize the gene ontology in public and I I sold my soul I said yes

05:48.240 --> 05:55.680
I'm not criticizing the gene ontology today the gene ontology has improved in part I think because

05:55.680 --> 06:03.680
of some of the things I did but more importantly I helped the gene ontology to marshal or heard the

06:03.680 --> 06:10.160
many cats that is to say the many other ontologies which were being built in biomedicine in its

06:10.160 --> 06:17.200
wake ontologies in areas like proteomics or anatomy or disease and some of the ontologies

06:17.200 --> 06:23.920
mentioned by John earlier today were built precisely in this effervescence of ontology

06:23.920 --> 06:30.960
creativity in medicine or in let's say biology to be careful which arose as a result of the

06:30.960 --> 06:38.640
success of the gene ontology so the oboe foundry is a collection of ontologies which are built to

06:38.640 --> 06:46.000
be interoperable from the very start so this is anticipating silos and deliberately taking

06:46.000 --> 06:53.440
steps establishing principles to avoid the the appearance of those silos by ensuring that

06:53.440 --> 07:00.240
everybody involved in the ontology building effort is aware of what everyone else who is involved

07:00.240 --> 07:07.600
in the ontology building effort at the points where the ontology is overlap so that the overlap

07:07.600 --> 07:13.360
is always such that the ontologies which do overlap are consistent in those areas

07:14.240 --> 07:20.560
so this is a picture of the of the oboe foundry as it then was basic formal ontology is

07:21.360 --> 07:28.080
the very top level of the gene ontology it's a reverse engineered generalization of the

07:28.080 --> 07:35.040
gene ontology which covers everything in the universe but only at a very general metaphysical

07:35.040 --> 07:42.160
level and we'll see a bit more about what that means later on so basic formal ontology is the key

07:42.880 --> 07:49.760
to the unifiability of all the ontologies which are built in a way that descends from basic

07:49.760 --> 07:55.920
formal ontology it provides the starting point for defining the terms in non-circular ways

07:56.480 --> 08:04.800
in principle in every other ontology we've got now to 2005 now this this is a hub and

08:04.800 --> 08:11.040
spokes model of ontology development you start with the top level and then you move to a slightly

08:11.040 --> 08:15.760
the most specific level and then you move from there to a slightly more specific level all the

08:15.760 --> 08:23.280
while maintaining maximal consistency in areas where ontology is overlap and this works it worked

08:23.280 --> 08:32.560
really well and the army heard about it and in 2008 I was presenting a talk which was designed to

08:32.560 --> 08:39.520
help the army solve problems that they had with silos in their data from Afghanistan at the time

08:39.520 --> 08:46.960
and it was the army eventually which sponsored the proposal to make BFO an international standard

08:46.960 --> 08:54.960
ISO IEC 21838-2 I'll come back to that well it's here actually there are two parts the first part

08:55.680 --> 09:00.880
standardize is what it means to be a top level ontology so an ontology that can serve as a

09:00.880 --> 09:08.400
universal general hub for the spokes which are created by domain ontologies and then part two

09:08.400 --> 09:16.320
shows that BFO is satisfying the requirements for being a top level ontology set forth in part one

09:16.320 --> 09:21.440
and these standards are both in the public domain you don't have to pay for them and BFO of course

09:21.440 --> 09:28.160
is also in the public domain it's used now by some 500 different initiatives and the number

09:28.160 --> 09:35.520
grows all the time so in 2010 my colleagues in Buffalo received a very large IR per grant to

09:35.520 --> 09:41.040
create a set of ontologies to deal with everything in the universe these are called the common core

09:41.040 --> 09:47.760
ontologies they they were built to satisfy some needs of the intelligence community which are

09:47.760 --> 09:53.520
not important here but what is important is that some of the ontologies within that ecosystem

09:54.240 --> 10:03.120
were created for space and this is just a few examples so this is the common core ontologies

10:03.120 --> 10:10.160
ecosystem the space ontologies are down here so we have space event ontology space object

10:10.160 --> 10:15.760
ontology is space mission ontology and stuff and we deal with things like residence space

10:15.760 --> 10:22.560
objects such as satellites missions functions components and so forth these are the space

10:22.560 --> 10:30.240
objects and then we have object aggregates we have orbits so this is the ontology of different

10:30.240 --> 10:38.320
kinds of orbits you thought the idea of orbit was simple and it is not simple and then we have

10:38.320 --> 10:48.320
missions and maneuvers we have sensors and now we get back to medicine so John made a number of

10:48.320 --> 10:56.960
points concerning what we would need to address if we wanted to have useful medicine ontology

10:57.840 --> 11:04.080
and it's rather easy it's probably too easy to build ontologies the problem is to build useful

11:04.080 --> 11:11.280
ontologies and useful ontologies should be interoperable with existing useful ontologies

11:11.280 --> 11:17.440
and so there is a certain homesteading effect in the world of ontology if you have ontologies which

11:17.440 --> 11:22.480
are already serving a purpose and doing it very well then you should if you want to build an

11:22.480 --> 11:29.200
ontology in a related domain you should ensure that you build your ontology by using what exists

11:29.200 --> 11:36.400
already as your starting point this very often doesn't happen because you get paid for doing

11:36.400 --> 11:43.600
something new and for reusing what already exists it's hard to get paid and so there is a certain

11:44.480 --> 11:51.120
tendency to promote silo formation of the sort which John described so how do we build a useful

11:51.120 --> 11:56.720
space medicine ontology that was in fact part of what we were trying to do from the very beginning

11:56.720 --> 12:02.400
in the medical information science although of course we had no idea that this would become

12:02.400 --> 12:09.200
particularly relevant in the in the space context so what we want to do is to document

12:09.200 --> 12:16.800
medical knowledge especially as it's relevant to space travel and then we want to find an optimal

12:16.800 --> 12:23.360
way in which relevant knowledge can be retrieved on a mission and the idea would be that you have

12:23.360 --> 12:28.240
all the medical knowledge that there is and you have some way of finding the medical knowledge

12:28.240 --> 12:35.040
that you need that can then find that knowledge very quickly and very successfully and the problem is

12:35.040 --> 12:41.280
that all the medical knowledge that you have is full of garbage and this is one of the reasons why

12:41.280 --> 12:48.560
foundation models as described by Gary are so unhelpful when it comes to mission critical

12:48.560 --> 12:55.760
applications so why is the and totality of medical knowledge that we have full of garbage well first

12:55.760 --> 13:03.920
of all doctors make mistakes and medical science advances doctors don't always keep pace with medical

13:03.920 --> 13:09.280
advances some of them do some of them don't and so doctors have conflicts they have inconsistent

13:09.280 --> 13:16.400
diagnoses sometimes for the same patient and all of this gets added to the totality of medical

13:16.400 --> 13:23.760
knowledge all of the EMRs which exist and all of the problem lists which exist grow and get bigger

13:23.760 --> 13:29.440
and bigger and get added to the totality of medical knowledge all records are still records

13:30.000 --> 13:37.760
when doctors make diagnoses clinical coders have to document those diagnoses using clinical codes

13:38.320 --> 13:43.920
and those clinical coders make errors in coding and they have certain tendencies and habits to code

13:43.920 --> 13:49.840
in certain ways and different coders have different habits and then worst of all and that's what I'm

13:49.840 --> 13:55.600
going to talk about next is that the coding systems change and this is good because medical science

13:55.600 --> 14:01.520
advances but the coding systems should change gracefully and they should change in such a way

14:01.520 --> 14:09.040
that changes then can be fed back to filter out the consequences of the older systems which have

14:09.040 --> 14:16.640
been shown to be no longer scientifically coherent and even worse than coding systems themselves

14:16.640 --> 14:24.080
ferment errors because some of the coding systems are to be honest badly built and and then coding

14:24.080 --> 14:29.920
systems generate forking this is a problem that we will see in a minute all right now I could say

14:30.800 --> 14:37.120
bad things about most medical coding systems I'm afraid I had a a long career in which I was

14:37.120 --> 14:43.040
comparable to the little boy who says that the emperor does not have any clothes where the emperor

14:43.040 --> 14:50.960
were was world leading medical coding systems communities it was an exciting time this is

14:50.960 --> 14:58.560
a quote from Gary so foundation models he says are more like parlor tricks than genuine intelligence

14:58.560 --> 15:05.120
unfortunately the the problems in medicine don't even yield the parlor tricks they're not interesting

15:05.120 --> 15:12.160
errors they're just errors of a very messy sort now let's look at snow med ct which John already

15:12.160 --> 15:18.160
mentioned and he mentioned Roger Cotay I will mention a story about Roger Cotay which I'm not

15:18.160 --> 15:24.480
sure is true but certainly there's some truth to it Cotay visited the Vatican he wanted to present

15:24.480 --> 15:32.080
the six volumes of snow med ct to the pope and so he was chatting with the pope and the pope was

15:32.080 --> 15:38.960
looking at six volumes and then the pope raised his head and he said are you aware that this spells

15:38.960 --> 15:45.600
demons backwards now whether that is a true story or not uh no one will ever know so this is a little

15:45.600 --> 15:53.280
piece of snow med showing how it changed from 2016 to 2017 it's a very very trivial example but it

15:53.280 --> 16:01.440
will show you how you get bloat so this is the opposite of silos bloat is when you get inconsistent

16:01.440 --> 16:10.560
data because there isn't a silo in 2016 a test kit is classified as a substance which may or may

16:10.560 --> 16:18.880
not be good in 2017 is classified as a physical object which also may or may not be good but the

16:18.880 --> 16:26.320
fact that you have both of those classifications in your system is going to mean that data about

16:26.320 --> 16:33.040
test kit which was entered into the record in 2016 will conflict with data about test kits

16:33.040 --> 16:43.520
entered in 2017 and that's not good if it happens all the time now here we have 2015 2016 we see

16:43.520 --> 16:52.960
that there is on the left a joint finding and disorder of musculoskeletal system these are both

16:52.960 --> 17:00.720
parents of orthopathy which is a disorder now a disorder is something on the side of the patient

17:00.720 --> 17:06.640
it's a broken leg or it's a disease a finding is something on the side of a physician it's what the

17:06.640 --> 17:13.280
physician finds or discovers in the world one of the same thing should not be both on the side of

17:13.280 --> 17:21.360
the patient and on the side of the clinician it's a very basic error snow med is full of that error

17:21.360 --> 17:27.280
there are so many different ways in which that error is made in snow med that snow med generates

17:27.280 --> 17:36.960
bloat and now this is just one term in snow med and two versions 2002 and 2010 so the term is

17:36.960 --> 17:42.480
excision biopsy of vulval lesion this term is chosen at random you would get similar bloats

17:42.480 --> 17:54.720
from the many terms so every single track through this monster can be found if you join snow med 2002

17:54.720 --> 18:01.440
with so 2010 and the clinical coders are coding at different levels within this monster they're

18:01.440 --> 18:09.200
putting down data about one and the same medical phenomenon namely the process of biopsy from a

18:09.200 --> 18:14.560
vulval lesion and they're each coding that with a different code for how it looks is this so this

18:14.560 --> 18:20.320
is just this is from that diagram i've just zoomed a little bit procedure characterized by action

18:20.320 --> 18:25.760
status is a navigational concept in snow med that means it tells you how you got that concept or

18:25.760 --> 18:32.160
something and then you have procedure carried out on subject which is what snow med calls a

18:32.160 --> 18:38.480
situation we're also told that it's a procedure carried out which is another situation but at

18:38.480 --> 18:45.680
the same time it's a procedure on a body system which is a procedure so we have four ontologically

18:45.680 --> 18:52.080
different things namely navigational concept situations and procedures applied to one and the

18:52.080 --> 18:58.880
same medical phenomenon and the reason is that snow med's top level is incoherent now it's

18:58.880 --> 19:04.640
incoherent has been recognized for some years by what we might call the intellectual leaders of

19:04.640 --> 19:12.720
the snow med community and each year they propose to the general snow med management assembly that

19:12.720 --> 19:20.960
they should drop the snow med top level and re-architect snow med using bfo there is now reason

19:20.960 --> 19:29.120
to be optimistic that they will finally achieve a majority vote bfo does not allow that kind of

19:29.120 --> 19:35.440
forking it doesn't allow four different terms at the very high ontological level to be applied to

19:35.440 --> 19:43.120
one and the same item it's built on good ontological principles and it's much simpler to use than the

19:43.120 --> 19:48.720
snow med top level and it makes clear distinctions between things like entities on the side of the

19:48.720 --> 19:57.520
patient and entities on the side of the clinician so how do we get a useful space medicine ontology

19:57.520 --> 20:04.640
well nasa has a chief information officer and they have a an information system which is an

20:04.640 --> 20:11.040
information system covering all of the astronauts who ever existed in in the west and all the families

20:11.040 --> 20:17.920
of all the astronauts it's very high level it uses unfortunately multiple coding systems but all of

20:17.920 --> 20:24.560
the coding systems could in principle be unified and focused on a revised version of snow med which

20:24.560 --> 20:31.280
is what the nasa cio should be calling for a revised version with a proper top level it should

20:31.280 --> 20:36.960
eliminate the errors basically where they are easily identifiable and it's here i think that ai

20:36.960 --> 20:43.440
could play a role because we already have a large amount of data which is relevant to space missions

20:43.440 --> 20:50.400
because the astronauts are involved it's maintained and curated by top level clinicians and it's

20:50.480 --> 20:58.800
accessible already it just needs to be filtered to remove inconsistencies and well i just conclude so

20:59.440 --> 21:04.800
would therefore be useful for space medicine as john explained it would be useful for everyone else

21:04.800 --> 21:10.800
because it would serve as a kind of ground truth the equivalent of a foundation model but one which

21:10.800 --> 21:17.920
would have been well built and i won't try and talk about deep mind i will i will stop

21:19.600 --> 21:25.040
and i hope you're all still there
