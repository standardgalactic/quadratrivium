WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.440
We've been working on capabilities now for about three years, and we've gone to and

00:10.440 --> 00:13.640
fro on how we want to understand capabilities.

00:13.640 --> 00:22.000
I now believe that we have a stable view, which works for all the counter examples that

00:22.000 --> 00:27.080
people had been bringing forward, provided we accept certain caveats about how we're

00:27.080 --> 00:28.920
understanding capability.

00:28.920 --> 00:35.720
And the idea is that there are many words like capacity, ability, power, which have

00:35.720 --> 00:39.280
similar meanings to the word capability.

00:39.280 --> 00:44.000
We just want to standardize on one meaning of the word capability, which will be compatible

00:44.000 --> 00:51.680
with BFO, whether we introduce the word capability into BFO is still an open question.

00:51.680 --> 00:57.560
So this is BFO, and we're interested, and BFO is now an international standard.

00:57.560 --> 01:03.320
It's been approved, and you can find the relevant files here.

01:03.320 --> 01:10.760
So you can now see the entire ISO file content if you go to the right place, which is unusual.

01:10.760 --> 01:17.680
Usually you have to pay 195 Swiss francs to get the PDF version of the ISO standard.

01:17.680 --> 01:26.400
So we're interested particularly in material entities, such as people and laptops on the

01:26.400 --> 01:34.840
one hand, and in dispositions and roles, primarily in dispositions.

01:34.840 --> 01:40.320
Capabilities are going to turn out to be a subkind of disposition.

01:40.320 --> 01:47.960
But we're interested in roles because we have to distinguish those kinds of capability-like

01:47.960 --> 01:53.080
entities, which are in fact roles rather than dispositions.

01:53.080 --> 01:59.040
Those roles and dispositions are realisables in BFO terms, and I think we all know what

01:59.040 --> 02:06.000
realisable means, so an attribute of a material entity is a realisable if there is a certain

02:06.000 --> 02:11.560
kind of process which manifests it, makes it manifest, makes it appear.

02:11.560 --> 02:19.520
So going bald is a disposition which all males possess, and this disposition is realized

02:19.520 --> 02:24.440
in processes of losing hair.

02:24.440 --> 02:31.560
And so now dispositions are well-known, cases of realisables, roles are well-known, cases

02:31.560 --> 02:37.720
of realisables, functions are a special kind of disposition, and we're going to introduce

02:37.720 --> 02:40.720
now capabilities.

02:40.720 --> 02:47.080
Dispositions in general include bad things like losing hair.

02:47.080 --> 02:52.360
These are good things like thinking or speaking.

02:52.360 --> 02:56.880
Functions are really good things, as we shall see.

02:56.880 --> 03:03.840
And then roles are those things, those attributes which we have in virtue of some social convention

03:03.840 --> 03:06.160
or social description.

03:06.160 --> 03:13.840
So being king or being the owner or being a renter are all matters which hold independently

03:13.840 --> 03:19.840
of any kind of physical changes, where functions, capabilities and dispositions, all of which

03:19.840 --> 03:27.960
are dispositions, have to occur, physical changes have to occur before they exist.

03:27.960 --> 03:36.160
All right, so this is where function goes in BFO, and a function is a disposition which

03:36.160 --> 03:41.080
is the raison d'être of its bearer.

03:41.360 --> 03:45.960
Functions don't like it when I say raison d'être, because they think that that sounds

03:45.960 --> 03:53.360
like teleology, but functions are teleological entities which exist in the world.

03:53.360 --> 04:02.800
And they exist because there has to be entities of that sort, for reasons of survival and

04:02.800 --> 04:09.400
reproduction in the case of biological functions and for reasons of need or desire in the case

04:09.440 --> 04:15.120
of artifactual functions.

04:15.120 --> 04:23.040
So the BFO idea is that only material entities have functions, and they have that function

04:23.040 --> 04:28.040
for as long as the disposition remains a real physical possibility.

04:28.040 --> 04:35.080
So if I have a heat pump in my attic, and my attic becomes so full that I can't enter

04:35.080 --> 04:39.880
the attic to switch on the heat pump, and maybe things solidify, so it's impossible

04:39.880 --> 04:42.840
for any person to go into the attic.

04:42.840 --> 04:48.200
The function of the heat pump is still the same, it's to pump heat.

04:48.200 --> 04:55.280
So functions in particular and dispositions in general are merely a matter of the intrinsic

04:55.280 --> 04:57.520
physical possibilities of the bearer.

04:57.520 --> 05:02.560
The environment doesn't matter, where for the roles, the environment and particularly

05:02.560 --> 05:07.160
the social environment is the only thing which matters.

05:07.160 --> 05:14.320
So a very sick heart still has the function to pump block, even if it can only just pump.

05:14.320 --> 05:20.480
Maybe even if it can't pump at all because it's been removed temporarily from its hosts,

05:20.480 --> 05:22.760
it still has the function to pump block.

05:22.760 --> 05:30.200
So you're saying this is only a material entity?

05:30.200 --> 05:32.720
Only material entities have functions.

05:32.720 --> 05:35.840
This is just a terminological declaration.

05:35.840 --> 05:40.920
This is Humpty Dumpty, words mean just what I want them to mean.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.360
So you can't argue with it, it's just a...

05:43.360 --> 05:44.360
Excellent.

05:44.360 --> 05:48.520
So what is the function of that?

05:48.520 --> 05:55.360
So it doesn't have a function in the BFO sense.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.320
We can come back to that later.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.800
All right, so this definition of function is perfectly standard.

06:00.800 --> 06:07.960
So this is the Millican selective effect theory, which is also the genontology theory of function.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.800
But BFO extends it to include artifacts.

06:10.800 --> 06:18.440
So not only organic entities such as your heart have a function, but also your pen,

06:18.440 --> 06:23.000
your laptop, the overhead projector and so forth.

06:23.000 --> 06:31.680
They all have functions and there are two kinds of function, biological and artifactual.

06:31.680 --> 06:35.160
Now capabilities.

06:35.160 --> 06:41.800
Once we dealt with functions, we realized that there are other realisables left over.

06:41.800 --> 06:50.040
So a lathe operator is trained to operate a lathe, but it's not the function of the

06:50.040 --> 06:53.760
lathe operator to operate a lathe.

06:53.760 --> 06:58.440
It's not clear that a lathe operator has any function, but he certainly has a capability

06:58.440 --> 07:02.040
to operate a lathe because he's been trained.

07:02.040 --> 07:07.280
So this is the first place where capability comes into this picture.

07:07.280 --> 07:15.680
The chairman of the board has the authority to hire people or fire people or change the

07:15.680 --> 07:17.840
regulations of the company.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.960
That is a role.

07:19.960 --> 07:26.460
Now given that he has that role, he can do things.

07:26.460 --> 07:31.040
But that's not capability in the sense here, because it's not physical, it's not a matter

07:31.040 --> 07:34.360
of physics, it's a matter of social norms.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.920
And so we're going to ignore roles henceforth.

07:36.920 --> 07:42.040
We're only interested in capabilities.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.040
All right.

07:43.040 --> 07:47.800
Now these are the kinds of entities which can have functions.

07:47.800 --> 07:53.040
I don't think organisms have functions, but I'm willing to accept that the functions

07:53.040 --> 07:59.880
of organisms might be to survive and to reproduce, so purely basic biological functions.

07:59.880 --> 08:04.960
But generally speaking, parts of organisms have functions.

08:04.960 --> 08:09.800
All your organs have functions, all your organ systems have functions, all your nephrons

08:09.800 --> 08:11.440
have functions.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.800
So the organism is full of functional parts.

08:15.800 --> 08:20.740
And then all machines, all designed artifacts have functions because that's the definition

08:20.740 --> 08:22.760
of the word artifact.

08:22.760 --> 08:29.160
They are entities which were designed to perform a certain process.

08:29.160 --> 08:33.840
And that means that they were designed to have a function, which is realized in that

08:33.840 --> 08:35.600
process.

08:35.600 --> 08:46.520
And then I think organizations have functions to help the poor to promote the pursuit of

08:46.520 --> 08:48.720
good ontology.

08:48.720 --> 08:52.320
These are functions of organization.

08:52.320 --> 08:56.240
Now the queen bee or worker bees may have functions.

08:56.240 --> 09:01.280
So it may be that for colonial organisms there are more specific functions than just surviving

09:01.280 --> 09:03.840
and reproducing.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.000
Now we're still on the level of intuitions.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.160
We don't have a definition of capability yet.

09:10.160 --> 09:15.840
But it's clear that my car has many more functions, sorry, many more capabilities than it has

09:15.840 --> 09:22.320
functions, probably infinitely many more.

09:22.320 --> 09:26.400
And I've just listed a few here.

09:26.400 --> 09:32.240
And nowadays car manufacturers build many, many capabilities into their cars.

09:32.240 --> 09:39.600
So to allow you to experience G-forces for instance seems to be a new, in Houston anyway

09:39.600 --> 09:48.720
seems to be a new thing that cars have the capability to do and to impress your neighbors.

09:48.720 --> 09:52.760
So there are many more kinds of entities which can have capabilities.

09:52.760 --> 09:57.120
So these are all entities which can have functions.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.120
They can also have capabilities.

09:59.120 --> 10:08.520
But then these are entities which can have capabilities, which can't have function.

10:08.520 --> 10:17.760
Because organisms can do things like dancing, the Foxtrot, ruling China.

10:17.760 --> 10:20.960
And groups of organisms can do things like that too.

10:20.960 --> 10:28.120
And also undesigned parts of nature can do things, like caves and so forth, which are

10:28.120 --> 10:32.120
good for us, which we would like to happen.

10:32.120 --> 10:37.000
So the world of capabilities is wider than the world of functions, all right.

10:37.000 --> 10:44.360
Now this is work which is going to happen within BFO and so we have certain formal constraints.

10:44.360 --> 10:50.160
The first formal constraint is every function is a capability and this is trivial.

10:50.160 --> 10:58.600
If you're designed to perform a certain job then you're designed to execute your function

10:58.600 --> 11:01.320
but that means you have the capability of executing your function.

11:01.320 --> 11:05.320
So every function is a capability.

11:05.320 --> 11:12.760
And the second formal constraint is that every capability is a disposition.

11:12.760 --> 11:19.560
And this is, again, just for the sake of having a place for capability within the collection

11:19.560 --> 11:23.640
of BFO-conformant ontologies.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.400
And so it looks like this.

11:25.400 --> 11:31.920
We have dispositions, a proper subset of dispositions are capabilities, a proper subset of capabilities

11:31.920 --> 11:32.920
of functions.

11:32.920 --> 11:39.120
And these things sometimes have role-like counterparts, but we won't deal with those.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.560
This is the definition.

11:40.560 --> 11:46.920
This has taken a long time and it really does work and it copes with apparent counter-examples

11:46.920 --> 11:51.600
to some of the things we want to say about capabilities, which were problems for earlier

11:51.600 --> 11:54.040
definitions that we were experimenting with.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.240
So this is it.

11:56.240 --> 12:04.040
Disposition in whose realization some organism or group of organisms has an interest.

12:04.040 --> 12:10.360
And it's important that an entity which has been lying underground for hundreds of years

12:10.360 --> 12:17.040
and which has the capability of threshing a certain kind of wheat which no longer grows

12:17.040 --> 12:24.320
anywhere on earth, still, because it's been physically unchanged, has the capability of

12:24.320 --> 12:29.240
threshing that kind of wheat.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.000
Even though no one will ever want to exercise that capability.

12:32.000 --> 12:40.280
And that's purely in order to save the axiom that every capability is a disposition.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.280
All right.

12:41.280 --> 12:45.560
So now we have some axioms which hold of capabilities.

12:45.560 --> 12:53.160
So if a part of an organism has a function, then that organism itself has an interest

12:53.160 --> 12:56.200
in the realization of that function.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.040
And so that organism has that capability.

12:59.040 --> 13:06.840
So we can apply the interest definition of capability to organic entities like hearts

13:06.840 --> 13:10.560
and nephrons and digestive systems and so forth.

13:10.560 --> 13:13.160
All of those are capabilities.

13:13.160 --> 13:21.120
This is trivial because they're already functions, but still it's an important way to illustrate

13:21.120 --> 13:24.640
the role of interest.

13:24.640 --> 13:35.600
Now that biological axiom implies that we have many interests of which we know nothing.

13:35.600 --> 13:43.160
And for many millions of years, organisms had many, many interests of which they knew

13:43.160 --> 13:48.320
nothing of any of those interests.

13:48.320 --> 13:54.640
Now because organisms, because interests can exist even though we don't know about them,

13:54.640 --> 13:59.240
this follows that capabilities can be discovered.

13:59.240 --> 14:08.880
So there are many unknown capabilities in the world and some of them can be discovered.

14:08.880 --> 14:14.040
Whenever we make a plan, we have an interest in the realization of all the processes prescribed

14:14.040 --> 14:15.160
by that plan.

14:15.160 --> 14:25.600
And so if those are processes which are real possibilities, then they are capabilities.

14:25.600 --> 14:35.280
And facilitation in the prescription axiom, actually no, then there is a facilitation

14:35.280 --> 14:37.280
axiom.

14:37.280 --> 14:43.440
If someone has an interest in realizing a disposition D and if the realization of some

14:43.440 --> 14:50.380
other disposition D prime facilitates the realization of D, then that someone has an

14:50.380 --> 14:54.520
interest in the realization of D prime.

14:54.520 --> 15:04.440
And so facilitates here means either that D prime's realization is necessary for D to

15:04.440 --> 15:13.640
exist or that D prime's realization occurring would improve the grade of the realization

15:13.640 --> 15:14.640
of D.

15:14.640 --> 15:21.640
And mentioning grade here introduces the topic of gradeability, yes, Jupps?

15:21.640 --> 15:28.640
So if the facilitation also includes, the form of grade would improve the grade of the

15:28.640 --> 15:32.640
latter, then why can your axiom be like this?

15:32.640 --> 15:35.640
If you could only include the master card, it would be necessity.

15:35.640 --> 15:39.640
Then it would be with the axiom, which would go to the axiom again.

15:39.640 --> 15:44.640
But there may also be, X may have an interest in realizing the prescription D, but maybe

15:44.640 --> 15:48.640
not in D because facilitation is not a necessity.

15:48.640 --> 15:55.640
So he might say, D can be realized slower, if D prime facilitates and then I have D

15:55.640 --> 15:57.640
faster, I maybe don't want this.

15:57.640 --> 16:02.640
So he will not want D prime, but still want D because he's interested in the slow realization

16:02.640 --> 16:07.640
of D. I could like, like getting, like eating a meal slowly, but eating it quickly.

16:07.640 --> 16:08.640
Yes.

16:08.640 --> 16:09.640
And so on and so forth.

16:09.640 --> 16:10.640
So can you...

16:10.640 --> 16:15.640
If the facilitation is necessary for the realization of D, then I suppose...

16:15.640 --> 16:20.640
So that isn't a worry that has gone through my mind, but you've just given me a good example.

16:20.640 --> 16:21.640
Can you write it down?

16:21.640 --> 16:23.640
And we'll talk about it later.

16:23.640 --> 16:30.640
So I need to think this through.

16:30.640 --> 16:31.640
All right.

16:31.640 --> 16:36.640
So gradeability has been in the theory of capabilities from the beginning.

16:36.640 --> 16:40.640
So it's an important feature of functions that they're gradeable.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.640
And it's important feature of capabilities that they're gradeable.

16:43.640 --> 16:47.640
So your heart has the function to pump blood.

16:47.640 --> 16:53.640
And when it's functioning in a prototypical way, then it's doing its job.

16:53.640 --> 17:00.640
And it can deviate from doing that job more and more, but then the heart is no longer functioning

17:00.640 --> 17:03.640
and you're dead.

17:03.640 --> 17:09.640
So that's when the function and the capability go out of existence.

17:09.640 --> 17:17.640
And this is the extreme form of gradeability, zero score on the gradeability change.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.640
But all capabilities have gradeability in that sense.

17:20.640 --> 17:25.640
And that goes hand in hand with the fact that capabilities are what we learn in school.

17:25.640 --> 17:34.640
So we were learning earlier today about how education is to either create capabilities

17:34.640 --> 17:39.640
or increase the grade of capabilities.

17:39.640 --> 17:44.640
Capabilities like functions are permanent, so they last for so long as the disposition,

17:44.640 --> 17:49.640
which they are the disposition, exists as a real physical possibility.

17:49.640 --> 17:56.640
So this is a summary which just lists the definitions in the order which I gave them.

17:56.640 --> 18:03.640
And now this is a restatement of how the diagram works.

18:03.640 --> 18:07.640
So dispositions sometimes are such that we have an interest in their realization

18:07.640 --> 18:09.640
and then they become capabilities.

18:09.640 --> 18:14.640
And capabilities, some of them, are in fact the reason for the existence of the bearer,

18:14.640 --> 18:16.640
and that's when we have functions.

18:16.640 --> 18:19.640
Can you go back to the previous slide?

18:19.640 --> 18:23.640
There's a permanent capabilities of permanent.

18:23.640 --> 18:27.640
Permanent until the real physical possibility ceases to exist.

18:27.640 --> 18:32.640
So you break the thing, or you...

18:32.640 --> 18:37.640
So you take the language...

18:37.640 --> 18:42.640
Which I'm coming to.

18:42.640 --> 18:46.640
You forget the language.

18:46.640 --> 18:50.640
Then the capability ceases to exist.

18:50.640 --> 18:55.640
So permanent as long as the real physical possibility exists.

18:55.640 --> 19:00.640
So long as you have the real physical possibility of speaking English, you have the capability.

19:00.640 --> 19:05.640
If you forget it, and then we have to teach it to you all over again,

19:05.640 --> 19:10.640
that's a new capability.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.640
Bill?

19:12.640 --> 19:18.640
Oh, I guess I was thinking about things like offering...

19:18.640 --> 19:27.640
Yes, so if you find that Remdesivir has the capability of curing COVID,

19:27.640 --> 19:33.640
let's suppose you find that, then it's still not the function of Remdesivir to cure COVID.

19:33.640 --> 19:40.640
But if you then make new Remdesivir pills, are they pills?

19:40.640 --> 19:41.640
Yes.

19:41.640 --> 19:49.640
And put COVID pill on the box, then the function of those new pills is to cure COVID.

19:49.640 --> 19:55.640
Remdesivir is talking about things like aspirin that get prescribed for pain relief,

19:55.640 --> 19:59.640
and also it has a blood thinner.

19:59.640 --> 20:05.640
So first of all, many things have multiple functions, particularly organic things.

20:05.640 --> 20:13.640
I understand it seems like there was a social shift there, not necessarily...

20:13.640 --> 20:15.640
So it's all...

20:15.640 --> 20:21.640
Yeah, it's all a question of raison d'etre.

20:21.640 --> 20:25.640
But look, there's also all selected in the definition.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.640
So I mean, most of the...

20:28.640 --> 20:31.640
Since Earth exists, most of the time there have not been humans around,

20:31.640 --> 20:35.640
good design and things, but then all the functions were selected by nature.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.640
So that's what this is supposed to mean, right?

20:37.640 --> 20:38.640
Yeah.

20:39.640 --> 20:46.640
Yeah, I think that drug ontology slide with what's the generic for well-vutron and anti-depressant,

20:46.640 --> 20:50.640
that subsequently got repurposed for smoking cessation.

20:50.640 --> 20:51.640
Right.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.640
That bucropin or something like that.

20:54.640 --> 20:59.640
And when it's branded as well-vutron, its function is anti-depressant.

20:59.640 --> 21:06.640
When it's branded as the other drug, brand name, its function is to not smoke,

21:06.640 --> 21:08.640
they both have both capabilities.

21:08.640 --> 21:09.640
Yeah.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.640
So I think that it works for rebranding like that.

21:12.640 --> 21:13.640
It's not...

21:13.640 --> 21:14.640
It's in more labor.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.640
You can have multiple functions in one...

21:16.640 --> 21:17.640
Right.

21:17.640 --> 21:18.640
Yeah.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.640
Like well-vutron does not have the anti-smoking...

21:20.640 --> 21:24.640
No, but SSRI is a multiple function in more labor.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.640
No, it's not.

21:25.640 --> 21:26.640
It's got all those functions.

21:26.640 --> 21:27.640
It's alright.

21:27.640 --> 21:28.640
It's alright.

21:28.640 --> 21:33.640
But if a new function is assigned to it, because you give it to drivers,

21:33.640 --> 21:38.640
then it's added and then you have a new function until the second period.

21:38.640 --> 21:44.640
So I guess I think about this a little bit from a data annotator standpoint.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.640
And I'm trying to...

21:46.640 --> 21:48.640
You know, I have all these drugs.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.640
I have these drugs in different names.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.640
And I run across and I say,

21:52.640 --> 21:55.640
wow, should I say this is the capability of the drug,

21:55.640 --> 21:59.640
the disposition of the drug, the function of the drug.

21:59.640 --> 22:04.640
And I can draw some pretty clear guidelines into a function of disposition.

22:04.640 --> 22:11.640
But what I mean by this is that capability of disposition or...

22:11.640 --> 22:12.640
So every...

22:12.640 --> 22:13.640
No, no, no.

22:13.640 --> 22:14.640
To me...

22:14.640 --> 22:17.640
Every capability is a disposition.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.640
So you're always safe to use disposition.

22:20.640 --> 22:24.640
And I think that it's actually going to make your life easier.

22:24.640 --> 22:28.640
You can always use capability if you're not sure what the function is.

22:28.640 --> 22:33.640
So if you know that this pill has the capability to cure depression,

22:33.640 --> 22:39.640
because it says so on the label, then if you're not sure whether that's its function,

22:39.640 --> 22:42.640
then you just put capability.

22:42.640 --> 22:45.640
And the capability will be important later, as we will see.

22:45.640 --> 22:51.640
For drugs, it's not so important whether you get the function capability label right.

22:51.640 --> 22:54.640
But for other things, it is important.

22:54.640 --> 23:06.640
I could just see differences arising across multiple annotations of local capability

23:06.640 --> 23:08.640
or the disposition.

23:08.640 --> 23:09.640
So that would...

23:09.640 --> 23:13.640
And maybe that doesn't matter much, because they're all disposition.

23:13.640 --> 23:14.640
Yeah, exactly.

23:14.640 --> 23:18.640
But I think people might not like that kind of funny,

23:18.640 --> 23:22.640
because they might want their clear, clean lines between their options.

23:23.640 --> 23:27.640
So actually, you are pointing to an issue.

23:27.640 --> 23:33.640
One and the same disposition can be a capability in the eyes of some people

23:33.640 --> 23:38.640
and a mere disposition in the eyes of other people in important ways,

23:38.640 --> 23:41.640
which are a matter of life and death, as we shall see.

23:41.640 --> 23:44.640
So you're right to point out this issue, but I don't think...

23:44.640 --> 23:48.640
I think the issue is so clear that the annotators will not have a problem.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.640
But we'll see when we get to that.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.640
So this is the diagram.

23:53.640 --> 24:00.640
Now, there are some simple rules which enable you to tack back and forth between capabilities and functions.

24:00.640 --> 24:06.640
So it's very often the case that if a whole has a capability,

24:06.640 --> 24:10.640
then this is because it has some part which has a function.

24:10.640 --> 24:15.640
So my car can play music because I have a stereo system in my car.

24:15.640 --> 24:25.640
And my digestive system can digest food, has a function to digest food,

24:25.640 --> 24:29.640
and therefore I can digest food, but that also causes problems.

24:29.640 --> 24:34.640
So I have a capability to digest specific kinds of food,

24:34.640 --> 24:37.640
but my digestive system is generic.

24:37.640 --> 24:40.640
Its function is not to digest specific kinds of food.

24:40.640 --> 24:44.640
That means not that there's anything wrong with the theory,

24:44.640 --> 24:48.640
but that this general rule does not work in general.

24:48.640 --> 24:53.640
It's a general rule because it works often, but it doesn't work always.

24:53.640 --> 24:55.640
All right.

24:55.640 --> 25:02.640
So for organisms, we have two kinds of capabilities.

25:02.640 --> 25:09.640
First of all, to survive and to reproduce or anything which promotes both of those, such as eating.

25:09.640 --> 25:17.640
Organisms have the capability to convert energy in their environment at ATP.

25:17.640 --> 25:20.640
Is that the correct statement?

25:20.640 --> 25:29.640
So organisms have the ability to synthesize ATP.

25:29.640 --> 25:33.640
Because that's necessary for their survival and reproduction.

25:33.640 --> 25:38.640
But then they also have capabilities which go beyond merely biological capabilities.

25:38.640 --> 25:42.640
That's trivial.

25:42.640 --> 25:49.640
Machines have capabilities because organisms have an interest in their doing things.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.640
And those organisms might be the owner of the machine,

25:52.640 --> 25:56.640
or the worker in the factory where the machine is made,

25:56.640 --> 25:59.640
or it might be a patient in an ICU or a passenger.

25:59.640 --> 26:02.640
So there are many kinds of organisms who have many kinds of interests

26:02.640 --> 26:07.640
in the realizations of the capabilities of machines.

26:08.640 --> 26:11.640
Better in the realizations of the dispositions of those machines

26:11.640 --> 26:15.640
and therefore those dispositions are by the definition capabilities.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.640
And then we have great ability.

26:17.640 --> 26:22.640
So we can grade the realizations of capabilities from on a scale.

26:22.640 --> 26:28.640
But that means we also have abnormal realizations,

26:28.640 --> 26:32.640
which are not capabilities, but disabilities.

26:32.640 --> 26:37.640
So shopping addiction, for instance.

26:37.640 --> 26:41.640
If we realize the capability to go shopping too much,

26:41.640 --> 26:46.640
then we have something which is no longer a capability, Simplicita.

26:46.640 --> 26:55.640
It's a capability which has to be counterbalanced against the abnormal realization.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.640
And this is true for many capabilities,

26:57.640 --> 27:02.640
that they bring about abnormal side effects, which are not capabilities.

27:04.640 --> 27:08.640
And now we come to Bill's problem, Bill Duncan's problem.

27:08.640 --> 27:09.640
Yeah.

27:14.640 --> 27:16.640
That's a good question.

27:19.640 --> 27:25.640
I imagine that there are some animals who chased prey too quickly

27:25.640 --> 27:27.640
and suffer from that.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.640
But I don't know.

27:33.640 --> 27:38.640
So what is a capability in one context may be a disability in another.

27:38.640 --> 27:43.640
So the capability to kill without feelings of guilt.

27:45.640 --> 27:49.640
Normally we would regard that as a disability,

27:49.640 --> 27:53.640
but in the mafia that is regarded as a capability.

27:56.640 --> 28:01.640
And there are many such cases where in one community or one context,

28:01.640 --> 28:06.640
a disposition is regarded as something good in which we have an interest,

28:06.640 --> 28:09.640
and in another context it's regarded as something bad.

28:14.640 --> 28:19.640
Then, okay, so they might regard it as your function,

28:19.640 --> 28:23.640
but they wouldn't be right because in BFO terms it's not your function.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.640
Because it's not your raison d'etre.

28:27.640 --> 28:28.640
All right.

28:30.640 --> 28:34.640
And now here are the areas where capabilities data is going to be important.

28:34.640 --> 28:37.640
First of all, with regard to education and training,

28:37.640 --> 28:39.640
which is why great ability is important,

28:39.640 --> 28:42.640
with regard to hiring and promotion,

28:44.640 --> 28:47.640
all human capital has to do with the capabilities

28:47.640 --> 28:49.640
that the possessor of the human capital has.

28:50.640 --> 28:55.640
Consulting, I believe, is largely a process of increasing,

28:55.640 --> 29:00.640
adding to or increasing the grade of capabilities of organizations.

29:02.640 --> 29:06.640
A capability data is important when you're doing mission planning

29:06.640 --> 29:10.640
in large organizations like military organizations where they have.

29:10.640 --> 29:16.640
In the DOD they have a whole department devoted to keeping track

29:16.640 --> 29:20.640
of the capabilities of different units within the organization.

29:20.640 --> 29:23.640
And then there is the problem of finding capabilities.

29:23.640 --> 29:28.640
So if you work for Google and you want to know whether there's someone in Google

29:28.640 --> 29:32.640
who has some capability that you need to exploit,

29:32.640 --> 29:34.640
then you have to Google Google.

29:34.640 --> 29:40.640
So people who work for Google Google Google in order to find the people they need.

29:40.640 --> 29:44.640
And similarly, if you work for the NIH or for any kind of large organization

29:44.640 --> 29:52.640
where you need people to approve grants or vet decisions,

29:52.640 --> 29:55.640
then you need to find people in your organization

29:55.640 --> 29:58.640
who have certain combinations of capabilities.

29:58.640 --> 30:04.640
And it's very difficult to collect and keep up-to-date data about those things.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.640
And there are whole disciplines of capabilities engineering,

30:09.640 --> 30:11.640
which are part of systems engineering.

30:11.640 --> 30:18.640
All right, now very quickly, because Clint is going to talk about this in greater detail,

30:18.640 --> 30:21.640
language is a capability.

30:21.640 --> 30:27.640
In fact, that's the definition of language which I want to promote.

30:27.640 --> 30:35.640
A language is, so this is a question which we could discuss maybe and maybe Clint resolves it,

30:36.640 --> 30:40.640
it's either a capability or it's an aggregate of capabilities.

30:40.640 --> 30:45.640
And so language is defined as a special kind of competence.

30:45.640 --> 30:54.640
But where competence in the Chomsky world is seen as a set of universal innate rules,

30:54.640 --> 30:59.640
universal grammar, we're viewing competence as a matter of capabilities

30:59.640 --> 31:05.640
which are realized by people speaking and reading and writing and so forth.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.640
And some of those are innate.

31:07.640 --> 31:15.640
Some of the features exemplified when we speak or write or read are innate.

31:15.640 --> 31:19.640
But no language is innate.

31:19.640 --> 31:23.640
Not even English is innate.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.640
All languages have to be learned.

31:26.640 --> 31:31.640
But we have the innate capability to learn some language.

31:31.640 --> 31:37.640
But for that, we need parents and kin and dictionaries and teachers and so forth.

31:37.640 --> 31:41.640
There's a category error in the writing part.

31:41.640 --> 31:42.640
Because?

31:42.640 --> 31:48.640
Because in the socialization part, societal norms, they cannot be at the same level as peers.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.640
Yeah, you're right, that's not my picture.

31:52.640 --> 31:56.640
So a definition of language, it's simple.

31:56.640 --> 32:01.640
A language is an aggregate of capabilities of its users.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.640
Now there are problems with this definition.

32:03.640 --> 32:06.640
First of all, it's circular.

32:06.640 --> 32:10.640
But I believe that this is a harmless circularity.

32:10.640 --> 32:15.640
And what we have actually is something like a triple of terms,

32:15.640 --> 32:20.640
each of which can only be defined by reference to the others.

32:20.640 --> 32:24.640
And which triple we choose to take as primitive,

32:24.640 --> 32:27.640
we're going to end up with circularity anyway.

32:27.640 --> 32:34.640
So we take the capability term in the triple as primitive,

32:34.640 --> 32:37.640
and we get the others for free as it were.

32:37.640 --> 32:45.640
And because we have an independent definition of capability, the definition still works.

32:45.640 --> 32:51.640
So I can give you other examples where this same circularity feature is present also

32:51.640 --> 32:54.640
where it proves to be perfectly harmless.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.640
Topology is a good example.

32:56.640 --> 33:01.640
All right, now in order for an aggregate of linguistic dispositions,

33:01.640 --> 33:05.640
which we call English or Italian or Chinese,

33:05.640 --> 33:08.640
to exist and to be maintained in existence,

33:08.640 --> 33:12.640
there have to be very, very complicated mechanisms.

33:13.640 --> 33:19.640
Mothers and schools and so forth to keep the aggregate of capabilities

33:19.640 --> 33:23.640
going from generation to generation.

33:23.640 --> 33:27.640
All right, a language is an aggregate of capabilities of its users.

33:27.640 --> 33:32.640
Now one nice feature of this definition is that we can define very easily

33:32.640 --> 33:34.640
what a dialect is.

33:34.640 --> 33:37.640
It's a sub-aggregate.

33:37.640 --> 33:43.640
So in other words, it's the aggregate of capabilities or competencies

33:43.640 --> 33:46.640
to speak the relevant language in a subset of people,

33:46.640 --> 33:52.640
almost certainly within certain contexts where they speak the specific form of the language,

33:52.640 --> 33:55.640
which is their dialect, rather than the more generic form,

33:55.640 --> 33:57.640
which their parents speak.

33:57.640 --> 34:00.640
So this is a map of Great Britain,

34:00.640 --> 34:05.640
and this is Manchester, which is roughly where I come from.

34:06.640 --> 34:10.640
And in Manchester there are lots of dialects,

34:10.640 --> 34:14.640
which are divided geographically in this way.

34:14.640 --> 34:20.640
I come from the rough, well, rough broad area of the northwest,

34:20.640 --> 34:23.640
not from the posh area.

34:23.640 --> 34:27.640
And what this shows, well, this is a, the English language in general

34:27.640 --> 34:29.640
is an instance of the type language,

34:29.640 --> 34:34.640
which is a sub-class of the type aggregate of dispositions,

34:34.640 --> 34:39.640
which is a sub-class of the type disposition in BFO terms.

34:39.640 --> 34:45.640
And then Manchester dialect is an instance of the type dialect.

34:45.640 --> 34:48.640
Actually, it's a collection of dialects, but we'll come to that.

34:48.640 --> 34:52.640
It's an instance of the type dialect, which is a part of language.

34:52.640 --> 34:58.640
So every dialect is a part of some language,

34:58.640 --> 35:02.640
in a very, very simple, myriological sense.

35:03.640 --> 35:06.640
And that's because one aggregate of dispositions

35:06.640 --> 35:09.640
is part of another aggregate of dispositions.

35:09.640 --> 35:13.640
And these aggregates of linguistic dispositions

35:13.640 --> 35:16.640
go hand-in-hand very often with aggregates

35:16.640 --> 35:19.640
of non-linguistic dispositions to behave in certain ways,

35:19.640 --> 35:24.640
for instance, to beat people up if they come from Liverpool.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.640
So...

35:26.640 --> 35:28.640
I'm sure you never did that.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.640
No.

35:30.640 --> 35:34.640
All right, now Sol gets many of these things right.

35:34.640 --> 35:37.640
So this is a long quotation from Sol.

35:37.640 --> 35:41.640
And the point is that my ability to speak English

35:41.640 --> 35:44.640
is based in the physics of my brain

35:44.640 --> 35:47.640
and of my diaphragm and of all the other organs

35:47.640 --> 35:50.640
which are involved in producing speech.

35:53.640 --> 35:55.640
Which are pictured there.

35:55.640 --> 35:58.640
All right, and now all of this is kept going,

35:59.640 --> 36:02.640
not only if there are people teaching each new generation,

36:02.640 --> 36:05.640
but also if people are correcting and enforcing rules.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.640
Not necessarily rules of good grammar.

36:07.640 --> 36:10.640
They could be enforcing rules of bad grammar

36:10.640 --> 36:16.640
because that's what happens with certain kinds of dialects.

36:16.640 --> 36:20.640
The dialects are there to protect the group.

36:22.640 --> 36:26.640
All right, so these are specifically human capabilities.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.640
Enforcing rules and so forth.

36:30.640 --> 36:35.640
Teaching, managing, guiding, appointing.

36:35.640 --> 36:38.640
Ah, we don't need that and that's the end.

36:38.640 --> 36:42.640
All right, so how am I doing?

36:42.640 --> 36:45.640
I'm actually, we're back on time.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.640
Believe it or not.

36:49.640 --> 36:52.640
So we have time, I guess, for a few questions,

36:52.640 --> 36:55.640
but we'll move to Clint very quickly.

36:56.640 --> 37:00.640
I just had a question about the barrier of capabilities.

37:00.640 --> 37:04.640
So when you talk about parts of my body having capability

37:04.640 --> 37:07.640
and then I have that capability.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.640
Parts of your body have functions

37:09.640 --> 37:12.640
and therefore you have the corresponding capability.

37:12.640 --> 37:13.640
Okay, okay.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.640
That resolves it.

37:15.640 --> 37:17.640
I was wondering about the migration

37:17.640 --> 37:21.640
and not, SDC's not being migratable.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.640
Like if I donate my kidney to Matt.

37:25.640 --> 37:26.640
Yes, good.

37:26.640 --> 37:29.640
That's a good starting question.

37:29.640 --> 37:37.640
So if you donate your kidney to Matt,

37:37.640 --> 37:41.640
then the kidney in Matt still has the function

37:41.640 --> 37:46.640
of cleansing the liquids in your body.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.640
But they have now the capability

37:48.640 --> 37:50.640
of cleansing the liquids in Matt's body.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.640
Matt's body, but they don't have the function

37:52.640 --> 37:56.640
of cleansing the liquids in Matt's body.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.640
It's the selected...

38:10.640 --> 38:15.640
So the design would take care of the case that was just right.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.640
I don't think that the kidney evolves

38:17.640 --> 38:19.640
when it's shifted from one body to another.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.640
I don't think we need to do that.

38:26.640 --> 38:29.640
We can use the design for the grown kidney in the lab,

38:29.640 --> 38:31.640
but I don't see why we need it.

38:33.640 --> 38:34.640
It doesn't have...

38:34.640 --> 38:38.640
It still has the function of cleansing blood in his body,

38:38.640 --> 38:42.640
but it has now the capability of cleansing liquids in...

38:43.640 --> 38:44.640
And the function too.

38:44.640 --> 38:46.640
And the function too, I agree.

38:46.640 --> 38:47.640
The capability...

38:47.640 --> 38:48.640
It's not...

38:48.640 --> 38:51.640
No, this is the etiological theory.

38:51.640 --> 38:54.640
The function or the capability of an entity

38:54.640 --> 38:58.640
depends on where it comes from.

38:58.640 --> 38:59.640
So...

39:01.640 --> 39:03.640
Anyway, we can...

39:03.640 --> 39:06.640
I have an issue with the definition of capability

39:06.640 --> 39:08.640
and the word interest.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.640
So what you're saying is that capability

39:11.640 --> 39:15.640
can only be assigned to an organism that hasn't...

39:15.640 --> 39:16.640
No, no.

39:16.640 --> 39:20.640
There has to be an organism or a group of organisms

39:20.640 --> 39:24.640
which has an interest in the realization of a disposition

39:24.640 --> 39:26.640
for it to be a capability.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.640
But the disposition could be in another human being,

39:28.640 --> 39:32.640
or it could be in a table or a planet or...

39:34.640 --> 39:36.640
So there are lots of entities,

39:36.640 --> 39:38.640
kinds of entities have capabilities,

39:38.640 --> 39:41.640
but only the ones where we have some interest.

39:42.640 --> 39:48.640
Capability is an interest-dependent notion,

39:48.640 --> 39:49.640
which is...

39:49.640 --> 39:54.640
This is not that of the organisms that are...

39:54.640 --> 39:56.640
We ask humans, I guess.

39:56.640 --> 39:59.640
Well, no, the rats and mice have interests

39:59.640 --> 40:01.640
in the functioning of their parts too,

40:01.640 --> 40:03.640
so they have capabilities.

40:03.640 --> 40:05.640
It's not just humans.

40:05.640 --> 40:07.640
Tables don't have an interest.

40:08.640 --> 40:11.640
No, tables don't have an interest.

40:15.640 --> 40:16.640
Any more?

40:17.640 --> 40:19.640
Okay, so Clint...
