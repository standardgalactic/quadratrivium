1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,320
On the program it says the ontology of social services but this grew and it's become very

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,560
complicated.

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:23,440
So I've been working on the ontology of services for many years and with the distinction between

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,440
goods and services and I don't think it's possible to provide a good definition of either

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,080
of these two terms which will please everybody.

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,960
We have to make sacrifices at the edges but I think that I've found a way of organising

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,240
a lot of the data that we have about goods and services in a way which is interesting

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:51,520
and potentially also useful and I want to use the word good to mean an independent continuance.

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,320
I'll talk a little bit about the issue that Matt raised earlier about goods which are

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,720
not independent continuance but for the moment I want to focus on this case and then I'm

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:08,120
going to talk about services and I'm going to suggest there are really two kinds of services.

12
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,600
On the one hand there are what we might call pure services which are just processes but

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,120
then on the other hand there are the great majority of services which create things and

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,280
it will become clear what they create as we go along.

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,480
Now the starting point is national income statistics or gross domestic product statistics

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,480
and the official tables for gross domestic product start with these items so personal

17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:44,040
consumption expenditures are divided into expenditures on goods that means either durable

18
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,840
goods like refrigerators on young durable goods like hamburgers and then services so

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,800
they are pretty clear that there are two different kinds of entity at work here and they're

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:01,560
interested in these kinds of entities because money is involved and I am primarily interested

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,280
in these kinds of entities also because money is involved but I think that the distinction

22
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,960
holds even where no money is involved so this distinction can be applied for instance to

23
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,160
the charitable work of a convent for instance.

24
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,840
Alright so goods are material entities and they're created by manufacturers and farmers

25
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:29,240
and so forth and then there are some people think there are immaterial goods I don't have

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:36,040
a finished view on this but my current view says in the olden days software was a material

27
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,760
good it was made of silicon and rubber and whatever floppy disks were made of today you

28
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,280
don't buy software you rent it or you buy the rights to it you pay a fee so you can

29
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,240
have a right to use the software and the same I think applies to insurance you pay a fee

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,040
for the right to receive payments if you have a certain kind of loss so you pay a fee in

31
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,720
essence to gamble and so I don't think these are good counter examples to the idea that

32
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,920
goods are much material but as I say I have no finished view about this.

33
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,640
Now one, this is a little bit of philosophy here so I apologise, one distinction that

34
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,160
philosophers like to make is the distinction between intrinsic goods which I'm here calling

35
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,000
ultimate goods which are good in their own right and not for another reason that they

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,440
serve so these are all intrinsic goods you don't eat a hamburger because you want to

37
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,200
bring about another effect you eat a hamburger because the hamburger is a good in its own

38
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,640
right and similarly for all these other things so you don't read a novel because you want

39
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,440
to achieve something else you read the novel because reading the novel is good in its own

40
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:58,360
right well non-ultimate goods are goods that are involved in a chain of creation of ultimately

41
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,600
ultimate goods so the steering wheel is a good because it's going to become part of

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,480
a car which may be good in its own right and the design for a car is a good because it's

43
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,720
going to be used as a design for building a car which is a good in its own right so

44
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,720
there are goods which are goods for something and then there are goods which are goods in

45
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,960
their own right and there are many on either side and it's important to keep this distinction

46
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,120
in mind and if you want a little exercise you might think about whether there is a distinction

47
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:39,520
between ultimate services and services which are for something else goods have an economic

48
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,800
value but only if they enter into buying and selling processes and buying and selling unless

49
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:54,400
you do it yourself are services so when you buy a car this is a picture taken in the max

50
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:02,320
Heidegger RG which is the BMW sales center in Liechtenstein you deal with sales personnel

51
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,920
who offer services what do they bring about they bring about a new pattern of ownership

52
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,280
basically before the transaction you have the money and they have the car after the

53
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,360
transaction it's reversed all right so there are buying and selling services but there

54
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,680
are many other kinds of what we will call pecuniary services and the document acts come

55
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,800
into play in a big way so billing and securing payment and registering payment and ordering

56
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:40,080
and auditing and processing claims ranking hospital services ranking rankers of hospital

57
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,720
services and so on all of these things are examples of services which have to do with

58
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:58,040
the buying and selling the price determining side of things all right now goods are created

59
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:06,480
but then they're bought and sold they're transported it need be to the purchaser or maybe to the

60
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:14,040
finisher or maybe to the showroom where they can be shown to potential purchase and so on

61
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,480
and then that maybe they're protected they're kept in a climatized garage or something and

62
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,680
they're maintained and repaired and restored and so on over the years and then eventually

63
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,600
they are demolished or destroyed or recycled disposed of in some way so there is a product

64
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,360
life cycle the creation is the first step in the product life cycle maybe there's a zero

65
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:45,000
step which would be designed now all of these things are services so most of what goes on

66
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:54,040
in the life of a product a good is a service or involved services one way or another so these

67
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,320
are services which are applied directly to material entities so that's another kind of

68
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:06,920
ultimateness they are not applied to to people they're not applied to other services they're

69
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:19,320
applied to goods and demolition is a service I get a hundred dollars for every contract

70
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,240
that the bunker hill service is and then we have protecting services so you keep all your

71
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:33,080
cars in a warehouse which is protected by watchmen and electronic fences and cyber security

72
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:40,840
systems and so forth so certainly in the early stages of the supply chain for expensive goods

73
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,640
there is a lot of protection going on and then later on there'll be more and different sorts

74
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:52,280
of protection all right so goods are continuance so they exist beyond the time in which they are

75
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:59,720
created so there's a common view which I used to embrace according to which services all of

76
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:06,920
services are occurrence and I still embrace that view the common view will come in a minute

77
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:15,080
so that process is performed by a service provider or by a company of service providers

78
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,800
and now the view which I used to embrace for all services says that they're all what I would now

79
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:29,240
like to call pure services which means that production and consumption coincide at least

80
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:37,560
temporarily often spatio-temporally so a medical interpreter provides a service of interpreting

81
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,040
and in providing that service that service is also consumed by stuff there is no left over

82
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:51,160
and it's the same for a bodyguard a haunted house tour guide provides a service but you probably

83
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,960
forget what you learned so there's nothing left over that may be the memories which will fade

84
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:04,760
but no nothing which has economic significance for instance from any of these pure services I

85
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:11,400
think pure services are a relatively small fraction of the entire empire of services

86
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,200
so now let's move to social work and general medical practice

87
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:24,120
are these pure services so they can both of them have outcomes which means that they're

88
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,160
not pure services so in the one case the doctor may give you a bottle of pills

89
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,160
in the other case the social work again may give you a script which enables you to get money and so

90
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:43,880
both of them have alienable benefits and so they're not pure services so what about

91
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:51,160
just advice so you go to the doctor or to the social worker just to get advice then there are two

92
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:58,600
cases you ignore the advice or you accept the advice if you ignore the advice it's a it's a

93
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,840
pure service it's a very very weak and strange kind of nugatory pure service if the advice is

94
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:10,600
accepted however then there is something which survives and this is the central thesis of the

95
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:20,120
whole talk what survives is because you accept the advice to go running every day or stop beating

96
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:27,640
your wife or something the person who receives the advice acquires a new disposition and what

97
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,960
that means is that something in that person's brain has changed there's a new pattern in that

98
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,560
person's brain which serves as the basis for a disposition to go running every day or to stop

99
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:48,520
eating chocolate or something so pure services create no issue they're relatively rare and the

100
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,720
common view according to which services create nothing says that all services are pure services

101
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,200
and we reject that common view with the view that nearly all services create specifically dependent

102
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:07,400
continuance they create patterns quality patterns in for instance people's brains so these are the

103
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:16,360
examples of services and they're all impure services in my sense so the hairdresser creates a new

104
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,040
pattern on your head the gardener creates a new pattern in your garden and the teacher creates

105
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:28,280
a new pattern in your brain and none of those patterns are alienable you can't sell them or

106
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,800
store them or rent them but they're created by services and that's why we pay money for those

107
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:41,160
services because of what they create not because we enjoy watching the gardener or because we enjoy

108
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,120
hearing the hairdresser's clips but because we want the pattern

109
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,280
all right now this fits into bfo as follows the disposition has as its material basis

110
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,520
a new quality which is a pattern in the brain of the person who acquires the disposition

111
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,720
so we have material entities which are people families goods machines for creating goods

112
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:15,080
or transporting goods a pattern which is a kind of quality complex quality capability which i'll

113
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,760
talk about next which is the kind of disposition the client of the social worker has the capability

114
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:26,520
to go running every day and then the service itself which is a process and and now we can

115
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:34,760
capability a capability is a disposition of a certain sort whose realization someone

116
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:41,720
or some group could be an organism of a non-human kind but we'll focus on humans here

117
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:49,320
has an interest so you all have an interest in digesting your food and so you have a capability

118
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,720
of digesting your food your digestive system has the function of digesting food which is also a

119
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,320
capability but it's a special kind of capability if you have an interest in the realization of a

120
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,640
disposition that disposition is a capability we can now deal with hospital administration services

121
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:15,080
in the same sort of way so this is what we have the simple services which have outputs simple

122
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,760
patterns and the patterns are intrinsically valuable there that's the idea and these are all

123
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,120
experts who have certain capabilities so that they're able to perform services which bring about

124
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:32,120
these intrinsically valuable patterns but now there are more complex services such as hospital

125
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:39,080
consulting services and now we get a two-stage process the hospital consultant bears the capability

126
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:45,000
of the first type which is realized in the consulting service which has an output a pattern

127
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,680
in the hospital which is the material basis of a second capability which is the capability of the

128
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:58,920
hospital itself to smoothly more smoothly run than they did before the consultant performed her service

129
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:06,520
if you're lucky now we we are going to have ultimate services and the ultimate services are

130
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:14,760
just the first the simple case this case just the one pattern step and then non-ultimate services

131
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,280
will be the ones which have multiple steps in the case of the consultant we have a two-step

132
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:27,320
process we could have if you're teaching consultants to teach hospital managers how to run a hospital

133
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:34,520
that's a three-step process there and another hypothesis that we I think is correct here is

134
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:41,160
that many perhaps nearly all non-ultimate services are performed to create new capabilities either

135
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,840
new capabilities in things or in organizations or in people that's just a hypothesis but I

136
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,120
I have a suspicion that it's going to hold in many cases buying and selling I said yields new

137
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,000
patterns of ownership now you can understand the significance of that thesis so that we're dealing

138
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,760
with services in general as creating patterns and buying and selling our services and they

139
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:11,480
create patterns in a very obvious way all right now let's go back to the protect restore eliminate

140
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,640
kind of approach so we have this approach for goods so we protect our new car we restore our new car

141
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:24,520
by repainting it and we eliminate our car by disposing of it but you can do these things

142
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,920
also to patterns so we may want to we may want to restore the pattern that was established in

143
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:37,480
our garden by the famous landscape designer 100 years ago and so we want to restore the same

144
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:44,600
paint pattern not the garden as a good now but the pattern that was created by the landscape

145
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,600
designer and we may want to protect the knowledge that acquired or the capability of our dog to catch

146
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:57,880
beans all right but now we get another level of services because these processes are services

147
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:04,680
which are applied to patterns created by prior services when they successfully restored the

148
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:12,120
Darwin Martin house in Buffalo they went for the original seeds of the same seed stock

149
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:19,080
as we used by Frank Lloyd Wright to create the bushes in the gardens and so forth and a lot of

150
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:26,200
it had been sold when the house became decrepit during the period after the Second World War I

151
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:33,160
think by the wife of the then president of the university of Buffalo she sold some of the windows

152
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,360
which now cost if you can find one they cost $17,000 why do you want the original windows

153
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,600
than the original bushes in order to create the original pattern as near as you can get

154
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,920
it's the same universal it's the same quality pattern as near as matters so if you want to get

155
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,440
the same capability to play tennis thing you have 10 years ago they can be applied to patterns

156
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:01,080
created by services but the same distinction can be applied to patterns in general so you may want

157
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:09,320
to protect an ancient forest which has never been touched by forest designers all right now we can

158
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:15,080
see how this works for different kinds of services so teaching and training the creating is the

159
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:21,960
coaching training in the gym and so on here the pattern protecting is things like follow-up exams

160
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:29,640
and promotion reviews pattern therapy is follow-up classes more more more exercise pattern restoring

161
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,240
is they send you back to school and pattern eliminating is brainwashing that's not a very

162
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:43,160
good example but Ryan came up with that example but I thought it was good at the time it's still

163
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:53,320
good for some purpose all right now gardening is obvious so you have anti-weed chemical spraying

164
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,360
tree doctor historical garden restoration and then eliminating the pattern would be weed removal

165
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:07,720
and dental that's obvious so creating the pattern is with the nears and caps that's creative dentistry

166
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,960
and then protective dentistry as a mouth guard prevented dentistry and training in brushing

167
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,040
and flossing restorative dentistry is restoring the correct pattern in your jaw through filling

168
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:27,640
and then eliminating limited dentistry is removing the tube and medical in general well we have

169
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:34,520
creative medicine which is cosmetic medicine and then protective medicine which is diet and exercise

170
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:41,320
therapy for instance therapy itself repairing in other words the curing the infection resetting

171
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:48,680
the broken arm or removing the tumor so these are all types of medical services which involve

172
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,600
something created like that your whole body was created in the first place by your parents

173
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,080
and then protecting what's created repairing what's created restoring what's created or

174
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:09,400
eliminating what's created or bits of it and so this is a picture of the high healthcare supply

175
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:17,880
chain so you want to protect the services of the hospital and that means you want to keep track of

176
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:24,120
how all the bed linen and all the pharmaceutical supplies and all the patients and all the ambulances

177
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,640
and all the fuel and so on are being delivered to the appropriate place in the supply chain at

178
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,720
the appropriate time in order to keep the hospital and the ambulance service running

179
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:42,040
not to mention the 911 service and so forth and now this is the final slide

180
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:51,160
just to get back to social services so creative social work is where the social

181
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:57,720
worker provides advice which in the successful case issued the nudist disposition on the side

182
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,320
of the client protected social work is where the social worker reports the case to the child

183
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:12,440
protective services that may be another partner for CBP and then prevented social work is

184
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:19,480
counseling the client on incipient family related problems with the aim of preventing them from

185
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:27,000
occurring restorative social work is social work with the goal of restoring those patterns

186
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,640
which is characteristic of healthy family development and then I couldn't think of an

187
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:38,600
example of eliminative social work so my name is Bart Gajdović I'm a postdoc at the University of

188
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:47,880
Toronto at the Center for Social Service Engineering and we work on essentially data

189
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:56,120
standards and ontologies for interoperability between social services and we focus on things

190
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:03,880
like measuring impact of services and service provisioning on clients and so this is really

191
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,160
interesting work that well that I've heard today but also that Barry has been working on and we

192
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:16,040
kind of started this discussion at the the joel workshops we had a workshop there on social

193
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:23,000
services and so yeah so this is this is really sort of interesting work in sort of defining

194
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,000
services for maybe a different perspective or a different use case but I really like the

195
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,640
the direction that this is going Barry so thanks very much and you don't have a question or a

196
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:41,800
criticism I have three questions actually if there's time one is I'm trying to understand

197
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,040
what a pattern is it is is it just a state that has some kind of structure

198
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:56,040
so it's basically the idea of quality in BFO arises as follows there are two kinds of attributes

199
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:01,400
that things can have one kind of attribute is what we call realizable which means that

200
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,480
it's not really there as something which is manifest but it can be made manifest by some

201
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:17,400
made manifest by some kind of external signal or process or some other means so and realisables

202
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,760
we decide divide into two parts dispositions which I've talked about just now and then roles

203
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:30,360
which Matias talked about yes Matias talked about earlier on the other hand are those attributes

204
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:37,080
which are manifest all the time to the extent that the bearer of the attribute has that attribute

205
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,080
and they they're called qualities and now patterns are just complex qualities that's all we mean

206
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,920
so the kind of pattern that I'm thinking of primarily in many of these examples is a pattern

207
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:55,000
in your brain so that would be a very very complicated electromagnetic electrochemical

208
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,160
magnetic pattern and whether that well we don't use the word state as a technical term in BFO

209
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,440
because we don't know what would be a good definition of state but I think the example

210
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:19,560
will give you a clue as to what we mean by a quality pattern okay great my second question was

211
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:25,160
so this is sort of there was leftover from the the previous workshop on social services but

212
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:32,840
you mentioned that a service is only something that is either I think I think you said a

213
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:39,320
legislative or has some kind of monetary exchange and so no no I I don't I don't think I ever held

214
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:47,080
that what I and what I said today was that I'm using examples of services which do have some

215
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:53,320
kind of commercial or pecuniary significance but I don't believe that the account I'm giving is

216
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,920
exclusively going to hold for those kinds of cases so I have a I think a general view of service

217
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:09,240
which is as general as your view of service okay so something like a community providing services

218
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,520
to or some people in a community providing like let's say meal services to yeah yeah that would

219
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:22,120
be a service in my opinion okay and the final question is this example of eliminative I was

220
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,760
trying to think I was trying to think if something like removing someone's addiction would be

221
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:32,200
eliminative but rereading your definitions here sounds like that would be more restorative

222
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,040
yeah so I said that it was that the eliminative one was sometimes hard to find examples and I

223
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:44,360
can't find even one but there is someone in the room who I think has an example I wanted to offer

224
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:50,680
a limited to could be interpreted as a non-ultimate service through the cessation of the social

225
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:57,880
service itself but that wouldn't eliminate the problem on the part of the client that and all

226
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,840
of the other cases have to do with the problem on the part of the client and and you're not going to

227
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:16,680
say kill the client no would it be maybe eliminating obstacles in the clients I mean if patterns are

228
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:22,520
just in the client's mind would it be eliminating sort of cognitive I think that's preventive

229
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,920
sounds more like preventive you're eliminating temptations for instance but as I say I don't

230
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:38,600
think that there is that I don't think it's a sound category eliminative social service

231
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,520
it just doesn't feel right I don't think it breaks everything but it does mean that there is a week

232
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:56,280
point yes psychotherapy in Canada um so now I'm going out on a deep end but let's suppose that you

233
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:03,960
had a kind of psychotherapy which counseled people to commit suicide and there have been cases in

234
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,320
history where there were such kinds of people who went around counseling other people to commit

235
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:19,240
but it's not a good thing yes pet okay good I will use it

236
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:33,560
but yes I think you're still on uh no my end I think is down and you've answered my questions

237
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,800
okay good
