0	13000	Good morning. Welcome to today's lecture. So I'm very told you I think that today we are going to focus on once one computation quantum computing. Why are we doing this?
13000	25000	So to start with a small spoiler. So quantum computers are not from the, from the point of view of quantum algorithms. So which algorithms can you run on quantum computers?
25000	41000	Quantum computers don't allow speed ups for the algorithms that are needed for AI training. So I training, as you know, works with neural networks. Nowadays, most of the, at least the AI training that is, that is, you know, gaining traction.
42000	60000	Among the general public, that's trained using, using so-called neural networks, and they can't run on quantum computers, but they can be run more efficiently than on a normal computer.
60000	67000	And so, but why are we still looking at because we believe it's very important trend and so you should understand it.
67000	73000	So,
73000	83000	so we last time I was here in March where he spoke about computation. I would like to take up this once more, but last time I used for computation I use as a paradigm.
84000	86000	The
86000	101000	search approach was recursive functions. Now I want to do Turing machines as well just quickly, because I think it's very important paradigm to understand and then we will talk about logic gate based computation quantum mechanics and quantum computing.
101000	122000	And my goal is so is to allow you as philosophers to understand it and also as computer scientists for those who are computer scientists to understand enough of quantum mechanics, not as a mathematically but at the, you know, more verbal level of description so that you can get the basic idea of how quantum computers function.
122000	138000	And it. So, um, we saw last time already that if you want to understand agents need to understand models computable algorithms and complex systems and, and today we're going to speak and try again about computation.
138000	143000	So, I think Barry spoken about this at length right about models and modeling.
143000	155000	Yeah, so just to remind you. So what we are doing when we are programming computer, no matter what is supposed to run the it's a model in the sense of science.
155000	168000	It's a representation of an aspect of reality using abstract symbols that is created to describe explain or predict the aspects of reality in question unless it's a purely mathematical task by calculating a huge prime number.
168000	171000	If you calculate a huge prime number then that's not a model of reality.
171000	178000	And then that that is something else which we can't discuss now but most models that are put into computers are models of reality.
178000	197000	And we say that a model is adequate if relative to some set of requirements, it can be used to engineer an entity or an emulation that satisfies the requirements like an Airbus A320 satisfies of the requirement of transporting a certain amount of weight or passengers and cargo.
197000	201000	Over, you know, the Atlantic, for example.
201000	209000	And synoptic model is a model of a system that can be used to engineer given system or emulate its behavior.
209000	214000	So, now what's a Turing machine.
214000	219000	So, Turing asks, what is a computable function.
219000	230000	And his answer in 1937 or 36 was a mathematical functions computable if an algorithm can be formulated that performs this functional Turing machine.
230000	242000	And so if the algorithm P computes a function F, which maps T to N with T element of the set N exponent K.
242000	255000	And if P is the value F of N1 to NK upon the input N1 to NK element of T, after finite number of steps, then it is computable.
255000	266000	And it cannot yield an output if you input a vector so this, this is a vector like vector N1 to NK.
266000	285000	And this is within T, which is a domain of the computation that won't create an output. So, for example, if you give GDPT an image, it can't do anything with it, because its domain is language and also mathematics actually.
285000	297000	It can't use images for quite a while. He I think it's called is a neural network that is that that has its domain images so you can give it. No, it has I think it's domain text, and it creates images.
297000	303000	And, and but I think you can also give some of these programs an image and take create an alternative version of this image.
303000	314000	And so that, so that just says that the computability requires a domain for the function to work on this is very this is super important slide I actually didn't think of it when I wrote the slide but.
314000	327000	But what you can see from this last statement here is the narrowness of all AIs, because whenever I get an input that is not an element of the set of its domain, it will just fail.
327000	335000	And so all AIs put by this definition, all AI algorithms that can ever exist are always made for a certain domain.
335000	339000	Right. And if, and if you get outside this domain, it will not compute.
339000	355000	And so, and so I think with this slide alone, you can already refute the notion of general AI, because humans don't work like this right humans can always take vectors of input from a domain that they have not been prepared for.
355000	368000	Also animals can do this and that is what is called natural intelligence, but computers can always only compute something for the set of the domain of computation for which they were prepared.
368000	379000	So, the Turing machine is a model of a computable function, a universal Turing machine can compute all computer functions so this is the universal Turing machine this is universal Turing machine.
379000	387000	This inside there's universal Turing machine right so all your, your, your mobile phones and computers yes they are universal Turing machines.
387000	398000	So, the Turing machine is a tape divided into cells each cell contains a symbol from some finite alphabet zero usually zeros and once the alphabet contains a special blank and one or more other symbols.
398000	407000	There's a head which is called Q here that can read and write symbols on the tape and move the tape left and right and one and only one cell at a time.
407000	412000	And in some models the head moves at the tape station that doesn't matter.
412000	423000	There's a state register that stores the state of the Turing machine one or finitely many among these is the special start state with which the state register is initialized.
423000	433000	The finite table of instructions that given the state Q one, the machine is currently in at the symbol a one it is reading on the tape so right now this.
433000	438000	The head is Q one is reading the symbol zero.
438000	444000	And it's reading the symbol and tells machine what to do next.
444000	450000	Either erase or write a symbol, and then can can move the head.
450000	453000	And so, so this is how it works.
453000	460000	And here you have the simple Turing machine that doubles the number of ones it reads and inserts a zero between the two series of ones.
460000	466000	So, it's defined by these parameters here M equals and then there's a series of symbols.
466000	475000	And Q are the states of the machine. Sigma capital Sigma is alphabet input alphabet gamma is the tape alphabet.
475000	486000	And, and these this is and so this, if you look at it it has a delta has a state transition function that lets the machine move from one side to the other.
486000	496000	So the machine will replace a one one it reads on the tape by a one one one zero on one. So it doubles the ones it reads and separates them by zero. That's all it does.
496000	502000	And to do this you have on the student doing machine you need, as you see here six states.
502000	511000	And here we see what it does. So, the, the, the tape it has to work on is prepared to have two ones and three zeros and at the end.
511000	516000	If you see here it will have two ones zero and two ones, and then it stops.
516000	521000	But so that's, that's all it does.
521000	531000	Sorry, and, and let's, let's see how this works so in state as one, it, it actually reads the one.
531000	543000	And then it, it replaces it by a zero and moves one step right. So you see here it has replaced it by zero is now in state two and has, has moved one step right.
543000	560000	So in step in this now it reads a one and it's, it's staying, it's staying in in state two, but then it moved but it moves on one to the right by moving one to the right.
560000	569000	It was he it gets here. Right. So now it reads a zero.
569000	573000	And it moves one further to the right.
573000	584000	And here it, it's, it reads a zero it's now getting it getting into into into stage three and so on. So this basically this the state transit it's called a finite state automaton.
584000	599000	And the finite state automaton describes what the tree machine does, and it perfectly determines its behavior. So you could now give it, you know, the tape was a million ones, and a million and two zeros, and it would then move through this algorithm.
599000	606000	As long as it would take it to fill the whole tape was another million ones and leaving two zeros. Sorry, one zero in the middle.
606000	625000	And so, and so this is, and all computers are like this, only that the finite state automaton that is used is of course much bigger than this, you know, but every computer can be in the end reduced to a combination of such finite state automata and even so
625000	636000	even, even, even if I, if I have software running here, ultimately, this, when I program software in the high level programming language like here I have.
636000	638000	I think it's called.
638000	650000	It's a some C dialect and Objective C. So if I program for the iPhone with Objective C, I create ultimately many many finite state automata that work together to accomplish such computations.
650000	664000	And, and we will learn a bit later how this basically works at the level of the electrons at the level of the bits. And, and so, so this is just basically all you need to know just that the want to close the door.
664000	665000	Thank you.
665000	680000	It's basically just that, that it gets more and more complicated with bigger Turing machine, but they all work like this in every computer that can be that exists, including quantum computers can be represented, which are with such finite state automata.
680000	688000	It's just not done, because they get bigger and bigger and more complicated but basically to improve that this is the case.
688000	696000	I have here an example of a, of a finite but not computer function which is non recursive.
696000	712000	And, and so, so when the functions non recursive you learned last time when I was here that cannot be computed all Turing machine. So it's on computable and it's called the busy beaver function I will not go through it now, because when I wrote this lecture I didn't realize how much work it was to teach you quantum mechanics.
712000	724000	I need more time for quantum mechanics, at least, you know, one or one. So I will skip this but in the, but you can read this it's a super interesting problem was invented by, by Tiborado a mathematician.
724000	728000	And it's, it's very very funny. It's, it's very funny.
728000	738000	Look how simple the Turing machine looks and it can't compute. It can't finish it's, it's just, it's just super and, and I go I expand quite well here you then you have one.
738000	745000	How it what it does how it works, you know its job is to put to put the whole table of ones.
745000	753000	And it's just so funny. And, and here you see that it becomes uncomputable and why. So it's a super cool problem.
753000	767000	You have to work on it yourself, you will enjoy it and it's, it's the nice thing about it that you don't have to be a mathematician to understand it, but it shows you really clearly why many problems are not computer not computer but I just, I just have to have to skip it.
767000	771000	So I want to show you now before we move to quantum mechanics.
771000	778000	How logic. So, and we have any questions on this Turing machine model with the finite set automaton.
778000	795000	I mean, if you if you study computer science you are you write the test about it. It's not too easy. And then they give you, they give you for example a piece of, of, of sort of code to the code and then say write down the sequence of finite set automaton to achieve the pseudocode so it's, but you get the principle I think
795000	813000	right. It's just if you want to apply to save it gets a bit tricky but it's, it's just, you know, in the end math. So, so now getting to to the logic gas computation so you have to, the idea of of of by of the binological
814000	827000	was was invented. The first to invent this was a German called Conrad's. And at the same time Americans were trying to do a hexadecimal computer, which you as a computation basis 16 16 bits.
827000	843000	Right, so to experiment for and, and, and there is there are hexadecimal is an important principle today in computation, but it's only used in high level but the lowest level the computations are all bit to bit computers.
843000	858000	And so the each bit can have a zero and a one and Conrad's also realized that this was, was easiest to do because, because you can, because for true reasons you can use binary not binary digits which have had invented by another German called Leibniz, you've heard of him.
858000	863000	And, and, and he realized that he could use the binary digits and he would use electricity.
863000	875000	And so the first computation machine he built was was that rework that was put into production had, I think, 503 of four hertz. So it could do for computation.
875000	879000	It had a clock of four computations per second.
879000	884000	And as we will see that the parallel suffices to add to numbers.
884000	896000	I think you need a few more steps to do this we will see it a bit later, but, but, but it, it, but it worked and then very soon he built also electronic versions and then of course IBM start to build electronic version and so on.
896000	904000	But basically the idea is that you're using Boolean logic to to program the computer and you see it here.
904000	909000	So, this, this, this Boolean logic is called logic gate.
909000	917000	And so, if you take it so here you see an example of logic gate, it's an end gate will just, it's called gutter in German that's from the German media.
917000	926000	I often use, use illustrations of the Germany because it is, along with the Russian, the best for mathematics.
926000	931000	It's just that I can't, I don't know any Russian.
931000	939000	And, and, but I always look at the French, the German and the English version to select which one I should take and often the German is the best.
939000	951000	So, a logic gate is, is an idealized or physical device that performs a Boolean function, which is logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that uses a single binary output.
951000	953000	So there is a mistake here but I won't correct it now.
953000	956000	So the end gate, right.
956000	970000	It's, it's basically taking. So if you have fear current and no current here, you have one zero, then you will have no current output here.
970000	984000	Because this was a transistor. If you put no current in both you will not have currently either. If you put current in both you will have current and so on so the transistor is set up in a way to basically to basically implement this truth table.
984000	990000	Right. So that you get only one if both of the, of the inputs are one.
990000	1011000	So if you have an OR gate gives you, it gives you a electricity on this wire output channel when with one of the channels is has current on it. Right. So, so, and, and if you have now many, many of these logic gates you can build a micro circuit.
1011000	1023000	And of many micro circuits you can build a microprocessor. So in the end, in here, we have millions hundreds of millions of gates combined to make up the processor that is working.
1023000	1029000	And, and so this is a multiplexer.
1029000	1035000	And the multiplexer, and it has a truth table. Right. So how does it work.
1035000	1051000	It has a control signal called as zero. It has an input one and input two and output. And you see here that the control signal decides on on what is done with the input signals.
1051000	1061000	And basically, it's a data selector that select between several input things and forward to select the input into a single output line.
1061000	1077000	So, if the, if this control signal set to zero, you see the output here will only be easy role. But if it said to one, the output will only be one.
1077000	1089000	So basically suppresses based on the control signal suppresses one of the input channels and only put forward the other channel. So it's a way of basically selecting which channel should, should, should move on.
1089000	1102000	And, and, and so here, it's quite easy. You can see if, if this is zero and they're both zero, then the output will be zero, and so on. For example, if this is one, and you want is zero, this will be zero.
1102000	1113000	If you want is one is will be one and here's a simplified truth table. It just says, if a zero is zero, then you will have the, the value of easy as output. If a zero is one, then you have you want it out.
1113000	1121000	Right. And so, and this is a symbol the official symbol used in in circuits to describe it.
1121000	1127000	And, and it's made up of an and not at all gate.
1127000	1136000	So, so you have three gates that you need to put together. And so this truth table is basically what you get when you train together and not on our gate.
1136000	1146000	So you can see it all the examples how these small logic circuits or these logic gates are put together to create one small circuit.
1146000	1153000	And it's all about, you know, deciding how to which electrons should should move out here.
1153000	1167000	So the multiplexer is a very abstract, but everybody has used an adder, right, which is just if you type into your pocket cash, the three plus four and it puts out, it puts out a seven.
1167000	1175000	And, and this adder works like this. So it combines an exclusive or and an end gate.
1175000	1185000	So an exclusive or is, is the gate that it does this.
1185000	1199000	So if you have two inputs a and b, what output do you get so if you have zero and zero, it will be zero. If you have one and one, it will be zero.
1199000	1204000	If you want only if either of them is one that's why it's all right.
1204000	1227000	And, and all as computer scientists all saw, and the other is, is has of course this truth table.
1228000	1234000	And this one is like the Latin way.
1234000	1240000	Right. That's why it's always also in the military music.
1240000	1244000	And this one is like out, out.
1244000	1247000	Which means either one.
1247000	1258000	And, and so if you if you have now the two inputs here I am B, then you have the, the, the carry bit and the output s.
1258000	1268000	And you see, if either of them is one you will get a one here but if they're both one, you get a zero, but you will get the carry bit.
1268000	1282000	The carry bit will be put into the next adder to remember that you have over flown the bits of the of this unit and propagate this into the next adder so that you can get then what children one day.
1282000	1288000	So when you learn the cherry bit is just this, you know, when you do this.
1288000	1294000	You don't have a carry bit in the digital in the 10 digit system. But if you do this year.
1294000	1299000	Then I, well, but we can still do it.
1299000	1301000	Get to put yourself a small one here.
1301000	1307000	Then you, because we have 11 and then you have this, it's easier to see when you do this.
1307000	1311000	You know,
1311000	1317000	then you get the one year you get the one year you have to add the one year then you get the two year.
1317000	1320000	Sorry, we had one year and two and then two.
1320000	1322000	Right so this is how to carry over bits.
1322000	1328000	And basically this circuit was to see it gives you a carry over bit.
1328000	1339000	And so this is how the so and you can see here really nicely how it's made of an exclusive or and and and and and and gate.
1339000	1347000	And so this is pretty so so this is pretty nice, I think.
1347000	1349000	And the full adder.
1349000	1358000	This is just when you take. So this is, this is made of a this is the most elementary XOR and and get so these are the basic logic gates.
1358000	1370000	This is now one half adder and now if you put two half adders together and combine them with a with an OR gate, then you get the this table, which which is called the full adder.
1370000	1382000	Right and so basically with this you can build any processor because all the other calculations multiplication division and subtraction can be modeled on the on the addition.
1382000	1385000	Right. So, so addition is just addition.
1385000	1391000	Subtractions and addition with a negative integer might be getting so many many additions.
1391000	1397000	So three times five times five times five times five and division is just inversion of multiplication.
1397000	1400000	So, so now you've understood basically how computers work.
1400000	1402000	It's really it's really that simple.
1402000	1404000	It's just that the circuit.
1405000	1412000	And so, and it's fascinating when you talk to specialists who have as it is a profession.
1412000	1423000	They say, oh, you know, I had a friend working at Intel and she said, oh, you know, it's so annoying this morning again one of them mathematicians came to me.
1423000	1425000	She was from England.
1425000	1428000	She was one of them.
1428000	1431000	And, and, and very knows what I mean.
1431000	1440000	It's just certain socially, they want to come to me and wanted again to have something that is not cannot be realized in binary logic.
1440000	1441000	Why don't they get it.
1441000	1442000	I thought they were mathematicians.
1442000	1453000	It was so funny. And basically, the trick is to imagine how you can put mathematical operations in this format cleverly, so that you can get efficient computation.
1453000	1458000	And here you see just for completeness, how complicated you can get.
1458000	1464000	See this defines the output. That's a lot of the formula best in the proposition logic.
1464000	1470000	And this year is the is the aspect, which is a sum.
1470000	1473000	And which you see it's this is awesome.
1473000	1476000	And we will get back to the symbols. They're very important. You want to ask the question.
1476000	1479000	Yeah, so these
1479000	1483000	I'm just wondering, I understand the logic of these days.
1483000	1494000	But how is this done in the engineering in this actual circuit board, there is a set of predecessors that is set up to be an actual day or yes.
1494000	1503000	Yes, this is set and then afterwards you need to when you're doing the software to computer you're getting it or use these two ancestors to calculate this.
1503000	1508000	Yes, this is this is the lowest level code is about this.
1508000	1520000	The lowest level code is when the compiler gives out the instructions for the transistors or the circuit and all the circuits and the second element of the processor.
1520000	1524000	But the programming language is of course exactly correct. Right.
1524000	1538000	But when when you program for example in in C or C++ or any other high level language, ultimately when it gets compiled gets informed into machine code that tells it transistors, tells it processor what to do.
1538000	1551000	So, in principle, if you build a very simple computer that just has to add her, then you wouldn't make it that you need to have this compiler.
1551000	1557000	But in principle, if you just want to addition, just a written.
1557000	1561000	Yeah, you wouldn't need a programming language.
1561000	1567000	Yes. So, so how do you tell that this was true by putting electricity in the circuit.
1567000	1576000	You just tell them this but you just put it and then they do what what this circuit does just as a pattern does it and so if you want to have addition.
1576000	1583000	And you have an adder then you have to put electricity on the circuit in a certain reason. And that was the clock of the computer does.
1583000	1592000	It gives the reason of the pilot of the electrons, and then they moved in this reason through the circuit, and then then the calculations automatically performed.
1592000	1597000	And this is a deterministic device, it can only do that, it will always do that.
1597000	1610000	It's fascinating. And, and the idea that that was an Englishman for a change, Charles Bevin, he was the first to have this idea that you can set up such deterministic, you know, circuits, he did, and he designed it to be mechanical.
1610000	1621000	Right, so his idea was to do this in a mechanical way, but the gates were the same, they were just realized not as electricity but mechanically and, and so, and so even like this had already thought that the machine could be built.
1622000	1636000	Based on this principle and so it's, it's, it's not one wants to understand it's not so hard, you know, and yes, we don't need all this overhead if you at the very first one of the very first models, they were just taking mechanical points.
1636000	1650000	So he was simulated and said dry was throwing in points, because we're dropping in slots and then the machinery of adding was performed, and he had several slots indicating the value of the digital ones to add is through into coins and then they got added.
1650000	1661000	You know, and all this was mechanically realized that the compile there was a compile it was just the order wasn't by dropping the slots into the chorus, the consequence lot.
1661000	1676000	And but, but, but I think it's still the same. It's just that now there's so many the circuit there's so many micro micro circuits and so many millions of of of of gates that I added but that's basically how it works.
1676000	1693000	So, the story about chat GPT is told, according to which, if they just printed out the next most likely syllable, then you would get too much repetition.
1693000	1702000	And so to avoid repetition, they added a little spot of indeterminacy or randomness to the output. How do you get randomness.
1703000	1708000	If everything is going on, it's very, it's very simple that you're somewhere in the circuit.
1708000	1716000	You're so you build a random generator. There are many ways to be a random generator the best ones are using extra radioactivity.
1716000	1728000	But there are also other ways to be a random you can also do it with software so that you can make circuits that reduce random numbers they are not as perfect so if you if you analyze the output over long periods of time you can find patterns.
1728000	1737000	And if you look at a few outputs they create quite they actually simulate randomness quite well. And so then you basically somewhere in the circuit you put in the randomness.
1737000	1751000	So this is in the injective the randomness is created by answering the, I think, but nobody knows but I think that the most likely way I think it works is that the input is slightly modified every time.
1751000	1760000	And then the model itself, the core GPT format is totally deterministic, but if you slightly add to change the input of course with a different output.
1760000	1772000	That's why, that's why when you give the same input to JetGPT several times you get different answers. But I think if you do it over a long period very long period of time you will also see a pattern arising.
1772000	1781000	So, so, so, so how can it be that that an algorithm that that does something that JetGPT is actually with the value of such a computer architecture.
1781000	1790000	Well that's because JetGPT is one merely a very long equation. It's a very long computable equation and it takes a certain input.
1790000	1810000	The use of the symbols of the letters that are input are transformed into numbers and numbers are plugged into the big equation. Then the equation is computed using using using the regular CPU or GP was a regular CPU for for the operation of the equation.
1810000	1821000	So it's just computed like like this, you know, so it's just a deterministic equation. It's a stochastic model, but once the equation is set up it's just a deterministic equation running on a normal true English universal true machine.
1821000	1822000	Great question.
1822000	1829000	Yeah, so the machine will compute.
1829000	1840000	And also that seems random what it's really happening is that it's compressible into a function that is machine to that point.
1840000	1844000	Yeah, so it is also random generate as a Turing function.
1844000	1857000	And unless it's a real random, so sometimes you need a real randomness, then you use quantum, then use use quantum physics or use radioactive decay and radioactive decay gives you a true random pattern.
1857000	1869000	And so if you look up random generator, random generator, you find all the different concepts and also as the holy grail of random number generation of course, because that's a true random phenomenon.
1869000	1878000	So if you need that, then you use it and transform the signals given out by the physical random generator into into electron into put it into such a circuit.
1878000	1896000	Then you have a true random element and and random so computation with randomness is very important so by doing computations randomness on conventional computers, you can be you can actually get polynomial approximation to quantum computers for many many
1896000	1909000	problems. That's why why there's so little left to do for quantum computing, because now they've managed to find so many clever ways of using conventional computers to do things that thought that where it was thought at the beginning of quantum computing that
1909000	1913000	there's a big difference between the conventional computer at the quantum. Now this has shrunk.
1913000	1922000	And that's because because, for example, by introducing randomness into into conventional computing, you can you can eat up some of the advantages of quantum computing.
1922000	1934000	So, so I think this is pretty satisfying, isn't it, because now you know basically how this works. And you, I think as a philosophy you don't have to know at all how certain special circuits are now set up to do something.
1934000	1943000	It's just to know now how simple it is, you know, you just put electricity on this phone and this one this one then you get automatically you get the additional it's quite it's quite nice.
1943000	1949000	And it all works because of the Boolean logic that was an Englishman to by the way we define it first.
1949000	1952000	Boolean. Yes, Boolean.
1952000	1957000	Yeah, and I'm sorry, Brit, Brit.
1957000	1959000	Yeah.
1959000	1961000	Okay, I give up.
1961000	1973000	It's so complicated. So, so this is this is all I wanted to tell you about computer data. I didn't do it last time I think it was important, because it really really clearly shows you what is going on.
1973000	1986000	So now, to understand quantum computing. So, until when do we have this morning Barry to 12 so when do we have the first
1986000	1999000	So, so anyhow, so, so, so I want to explain to you how quantum computers work and I think you can, you will be after that you will be able to understand it at the level we just understood.
1999000	2008000	Yeah, I think we have the computers, I think which would be already quite a lot, quite some good. So let's start. So but to do this we have to start with quantum mechanics.
2008000	2017000	So, so I still want to talk to one o'clock so we do the first break at 11 for 15 minutes and then then we do the rest.
2017000	2024000	Okay. So, so I will try to not to add to do as little mathematics as possible.
2024000	2039000	I want to introduce some mathematical concepts so the very very important phenomenon is, is a wave, because the Schrodinger equation is a wave equation so you need to, we need to go through a bit little bit of mathematics and physics.
2039000	2050000	So, if you have here to pure sound waves, one with frequency causing those 10 piety and the other one was because it's a piety.
2050000	2063000	You will get a superposition and if you. So if you have two chords of an instrument that you, that you, how do you say this, that you stimulate to make a sound like on a piano.
2063000	2066000	You have hammers hitting on calls.
2066000	2068000	Yeah, but that's it.
2068000	2074000	Yeah, but I don't even know what the right unsubstant what the right English word for this is but anyhow.
2074000	2076000	Yeah, hit you just hit.
2076000	2086000	So, so if you hit on the piano to cause of pure, they are not, but if they were pure frequency, then you would have you get superposition.
2086000	2103000	And this, what's happening is that that because this one is 10 to 10 to eight. And so, so you get them superposition of them so they add up, but here they cancel each other out because this year you see it's positive and this one is negative.
2103000	2111000	And then they cancel each other out so that you don't get much signal here, and then they start to add up again here they're both positive and they're in sync.
2111000	2119000	And so they get high signal here they're slightly out of sync so you get less signal, you understand the way it works right. It's just adding up the frequency.
2119000	2128000	So, and every, and so by doing this you know the beats. So this creates beats when you get beats in music, they're created like this.
2129000	2134000	So this is this is just just to remind you of waves. Okay.
2134000	2146000	And now, let's look at the classical one of the experiments that that led to the discovery of quantum mechanics.
2146000	2166000	So imagine that you have a gun here that that is shooting particles on a wall that has two slits.
2166000	2176000	And if you if you shoot the bullets and now measure here you have a detector to measure where they arrive.
2176000	2189000	And you have one slit closed, then you get of course this distribution because you get most bullets hit here and then less here and less here, because of the way they move through the slit.
2189000	2202000	The slit determines this pattern. And so here you have very few and the most are here, more or less right behind the slit. And the same is two for the second set so this is what you see when you basically have one of the slits closed.
2202000	2205000	Now if you open both slits.
2205000	2208000	And you have these bullets.
2208000	2212000	Then you will get just an addition of the two waves as a pattern.
2212000	2227000	Right. And this is, this is called. So the probability distribution of detecting P12 bullets fired against the wall with two sets equals the sum of the properties measured in each slit, just the sum of the two distributed.
2227000	2234000	Now if you have a water source here now you tap into the water regularly with a small hammer, you will you will get this in relation to what the water was.
2234000	2245000	Now you have to sit again and the detector here. Now you see something fascinating if you if you close one slit, you get this pattern or this pattern which is the same as a pattern you get with the bullets.
2245000	2249000	But if you open both slits, you get what is called interference.
2249000	2261000	This interference is like the interference I shown here. Yeah, so they, so they, they add up and create a pattern that is doesn't look at all like just add an up to two probabilities, because they sometimes cancel each other out and so on.
2261000	2276000	And that creates a strange pattern. And so, so for a wave source to measure the interaction of the wave pattern resulting in interference pattern with the way with a different wave intensity is just not the sum but it's actually the sum of the of the absolute.
2276000	2289000	And, and if you if you calculate this out you get according to trigonometry you get this. So here the angle between the two waves is so to speak determining one of the terms, and, and so on.
2289000	2296000	So the data is a face difference between the two way. Right. So here was 8 to 10, the face difference.
2296000	2302000	And that that's what creates the interference and now.
2302000	2309000	So this is just not yet quantum mechanics is just to remind you what's happening when you have wave interference.
2309000	2327000	So, we have the first, now let's go through the principles of quantum mechanics. The first principle is that the probability that a particle starting at s arise at x is a square of an amplitude, the amplitude is written like this so this particle as should arrive at x and this
2327000	2332000	is written like this, and, and it's just a complex number if you calculate it.
2332000	2344000	And so, so, and so if you take this value and square it's absolute then you get the probability, and the value itself is just called the amplitude it's called the probability amplitude.
2344000	2357000	It's a bit irritating that has historically reason why it's called amplitude but it's not it's, it's only the likeliness that s will arrive at x.
2357000	2367000	And so just one important things for quantum mechanics, you also need to understand imaginary number. So this is the gauss imaginary number space.
2367000	2375000	You see it has a real axis, and there's an imaginary axis and doing that you can represent square root of minus one.
2375000	2385000	And, and so here you have the coordinates on the real axis and the point C is is x. So that's this plus the imaginary number times y.
2385000	2393000	And this gives you the coordinates in this Gaussian imaginary number sphere, and was it Euler.
2393000	2407000	Yeah, I think Euler didn't present it like this, but, but he implicitly use and Gauss formalized it, and Euler was a Swiss guy by the way, and, and, and this is the complement.
2407000	2425000	So if you exchange the plus sign here on this y axis by a minus sign, then you get the complement and we will use the complement all the time later on to just can imagine that the complement of an irrational often of, of, of an imaginary number
2425000	2441000	is called an imaginary number. It's complement is, is, is this the was the bar and, and I is just equal square of minus one.
2441000	2448000	So that's how you can imagine the small I square root of minus one.
2448000	2449000	Okay.
2449000	2469000	So, I still don't know what amplitude is amplitude is just the, the
2469000	2480000	the relationship this term the direct term X bar as it's called bracket as X, it's as bracket.
2481000	2493000	This bracket just means the likelihood that s arrives at point X, and we will see it in on the next slides. There's a good explanation, you will just see it graphically.
2493000	2499000	So, so but before we go back to this bracket notation, we look at Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
2499000	2515000	Everybody here has sort of the uncertainty principle right and I want, there's an explanation of the uncertainty principle that you can understand without mathematics almost without mathematics and I want to, I want to show this to you, because because later on with quantum computers.
2515000	2519000	We also see how important it is to understand the uncertainty principle.
2519000	2525000	So, so suppose we have a serious fit and politics are coming from very far away with a certain energy.
2525000	2533000	So, coming far away that means that they, they have the essentially the same energy and that horizontal.
2533000	2545000	So they all have a horizontal momentum P zero in the classical sense classical when that's from Richard Feynman, when he says clearly always means classical physics not classical music.
2545000	2552000	And, and so the particle is moving neither up or down because it came from a very, very fast force.
2552000	2564000	So the whole vertical momentum is lost. Right. So it's now only moving horizontally. This is by the way one, one of these instances of what's called Nancy guard right called physical theater.
2564000	2567000	Right. So you prepare you make you want to make a statement in physics.
2567000	2575000	So you tell long story that justifies your assumptions. That's the theater. And then you have the great thing evolving and all.
2575000	2583000	And so, so it doesn't move up or down just moves from left to right. Now the particle comes, comes out through the hole.
2583000	2586000	We know that position vertically.
2586000	2592000	It's, it's only in the range of B because B is the size of the slit.
2592000	2602000	And now the uncertainty of its vertical position is in the order of, of B delta y.
2602000	2609000	So, and now we might want to say since we know the momentum is absolutely horizontal.
2609000	2616000	We might think that delta P y is zero but that is wrong.
2617000	2622000	Well, we once knew that the momentum was horizontal, but we don't know it anymore.
2622000	2626000	Because before the particles pass through the hole, we did not know their vertical positions.
2626000	2634000	Now that we have found the vertical position by having the party that comes through the hole, we have lost all information on the vertical momentum.
2634000	2641000	And because according to the wave three, there is a diffraction of the way as they go through the switch, just as for light.
2641000	2650000	Therefore, this pattern is spread out by the diffraction effect where the fraction means that particles can hit here and then they get like it was shown here.
2650000	2663000	You know, they can rebound like this from the corners of the slit. And so this means that that we basically we are losing the information about their vertical position.
2663000	2672000	That's super interesting. Right. So the spreading out through this and this is by the way, this is from a dialogue between Einstein.
2672000	2684000	And I don't know needs more. So it was some of the great theoreticians was contradicting to the, to the, to the, to the uncertainty principle of height.
2684000	2699000	I think it was an Einstein came up with this. And it's very funny because they walked really in a parking lot in or somewhere and he explained to him like this with the slit was losing the information is really, and then later, later, he wrote the letter to him again.
2699000	2702000	And we still have this letter and so finally loses his letter.
2702000	2714000	And he just as he also described, it is so great how Einstein was thinking that he just, you know, the other one was challenging, but it just came up with this experiment and it's so beautiful.
2714000	2728000	So, so now we have lost information about, about the vertical momentum. So you know what momentum is right momentum is is mass times times.
2729000	2741000	So it means that that it determines it determines how hard this bottle will will hit against this object for example this and then it will pass on some of the momentum to this microphone and so on.
2741000	2755000	And so the momentum is lost and now we can detect this diffraction is a particle count and when the counter receives the particle say here.
2755000	2767000	This is the momentum in order to get from this blitz up to see. So the vertical momentum P y has a spread which is equal to P zero times delta tether where P zero is a horizontal momentum.
2767000	2778000	That's just trigonometry. And now you can can calculate how big the spread out pattern is it's delta P y equals P zero times lambda divided by B.
2778000	2787000	We have lambda as the wavelength. And if we make B smaller and make a more accurate measurement of the position of the particle by making the slit smaller.
2787000	2795000	The diffraction pattern gets wider because if B is below one, then of course, because it's in the denominator then the whole expression gets bigger.
2795000	2807000	So the narrow we make the slit the wider pattern gets and the more the likelihood that we would find the party less sidewise momentum sassy uncertainty in the vertical momentum is inversely proportional to the uncertainty of why.
2807000	2813000	And in accordance to quantum mechanics, the wavelength times a mentor is a plan constant.
2813000	2823000	So we obtain the rule that the uncertainties in the vertical momentum and in the vertical position have a product of the order of the plan constant. So, so if you multiply this.
2823000	2826000	So this is the uncertainty expressed as a product.
2826000	2832000	And, and this is greater or equal to the plan constant divided by two.
2832000	2839000	And so this principle is always valid in quantum experiments no matter which mutually read properties of a particular measure.
2839000	2848000	And so this will be very important for quantum computers data on because it actually means that if you want a bit, which is the equivalent of the bits. So here we saw that is a bit.
2848000	2854000	That's incomplete. That's not incomplete. That's not complete and so on. We will have some similar bits in quantum computers.
2854000	2864000	And they are called quantum bits and to get the such operators here that operate on bits that are called quantum gates and not any more logic gates are called quantum gates.
2864000	2875000	These are called logic gates because they operate according to the rules of proposition logic. And in one mechanics, they will be called quantum gates and and of course, when we have an output here.
2875000	2878000	We want to know what it is to measure it.
2878000	2887000	When something comes a bit after quantum computation we want to measure a bit. And then when we measure it we can always only get a zero and a one. Nothing else.
2887000	2894000	And, and we will later on see why this is the case. What this has to do with the uncertainty principle but now I derive the uncertainty principle for you.
2894000	2905000	And, and I think this was Einstein's way of doing it. There are many, many other ways to derive the uncertainty principle and it applies in many places, but this is the simplest one.
2905000	2911000	And it was made by Einstein. It's funny because Einstein on the walk made a contribution quantum mechanics.
2911000	2922000	It's quite a full story. It shows how he thought, you know, and, and I think he also made with the EPR paradox on he made the most deep statement about quantum mechanics.
2922000	2932000	He made though I just wasn't participating in inventing quantum mechanics. He was witnessing it for decades, you know, I mean, Trödinger came out with the equation 26 Einstein died in 55.
2932000	2940000	And so, and so he was for 30 years he was commenting on it. And he made the observation that quantum mechanics incomplete and we will get back to this.
2940000	2945000	So, now let's look at what.
2945000	2954000	So quantum mechanics, the principle of uncertainty without understanding other questions to this.
2954000	2960000	Why is because you introduce it on this slide, but you don't say what why.
2960000	2966000	So why is just the, the vertical place.
2966000	2974000	So, so this is, this is the, this is a vertical place and this is a vertical momentum.
2974000	2987000	And it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's an imperfection of the slides due to because I was when I wrote this so in this that I, and it's so clear always in physics when you just have the letters x y and z it's just location right.
2987000	2992000	So, and this is, this is so this is the location is a momentum.
2992000	3000000	And yeah, so it's I say it here, vertical momentum and so this is vertical momentum this vertical position.
3000000	3011000	Now, now the doubles it so now we don't have to this year was a gun with small bullets, the classic like a classic gun but tiny bullets may be made of aluminium.
3011000	3015000	Now we have a gun that shoots electrons.
3015000	3028000	And so, so we have again a wall with some slits we have the detector we have a backstop and then now we measure the close the two and we measure and we get this pattern, and we do the inverse closest and we get this pattern.
3028000	3038000	So now the, the, the electron gun behaves like particle, because you measure the pattern that you would measure with small aluminium bullets.
3038000	3046000	Now if you open both slits, it looks like a wave, because we don't obtain this anymore.
3046000	3054000	But we obtain the pattern like with a wave, but wait a minute we have short we short particles with the electron gun, we can create such a gun right.
3055000	3062000	So this was when this was observed for the first time, they were almost desperate. They couldn't believe it.
3062000	3072000	And, and, and I made this joke already last September once the Germans could everything of all of us in Germany.
3072000	3079000	There was only one quantum physicist was working Germany but not German, a major one and then was another French one.
3079000	3091000	And Iraq was a French one that was a Danish one all the other were German. So the Germans could figure to still figure this out, but for the general theory of relativity they needed to do.
3091000	3105000	But this they could figure out, because they could use their classical physics. And so, so when electrons with classical physics we got as part of the fight against the wall, the probability of detecting the electrons which wants to close is just this, but the probability
3105000	3115000	of the distribution is not the sum of the two detected intensities as with the bullets, but instead the pattern looks like a wave interference pattern, which you remember has this equation with the cosine term.
3115000	3119000	Right. And so, and so.
3119000	3128000	So it seems that the electrons be like behave like particles was only once it but like where we suppose this was the second important experiment which could not be explained using classical physics.
3128000	3143000	So now, now let's go to the second principle when the event can occur in several alternative ways, the probability amplitude for the event is the sum of the probability amplitude for each way considered separately.
3143000	3158000	So, so this is, this is both holds open is this amplitude plus this amplitude, but you have to, you have to square this, so the interference and
3158000	3167000	Yeah, so here you see it again. So I don't know why I have two slides here but this is just showing this that that that if you close the slits.
3167000	3176000	Now, now both sets are open now you get this pattern. And this is computed like this.
3176000	3189000	And now we also start to understand so very now you understand this notation. So you see, this is the likelihood of of getting from S which is here to x which is here.
3190000	3207000	And so, and so now what you can see also what is very important is that you have to add this likelihood to go through one from S to one to X to the likelihood to go from S to two to X, and then square it.
3207000	3209000	Right.
3210000	3222000	If an experiment is performed which is capital of determining whether one or another alternative actually taken the probabilities of the event is a sum of the value for each alternative interference is lost.
3222000	3231000	Right. So here, if you if you close one of the slits, you can, you can, you can lose it, you lose the interference.
3231000	3239000	And here again, if you have now several tools slits, this is super important to understand quantum mechanics.
3239000	3250000	Now we want to understand the likelihood of going from S to the character X, and we have put your two walls. So now we have, we want to we have first to see.
3250000	3259000	We have the possibility of going from S to one, then from one to a, and then from a to X, that's one path to go from from S to X.
3259000	3271000	And then the next path which goes from S to one, then to be then to X, and then we have the next one which goes from it's not shown here, which goes from S to one from one to see and from C to X.
3271000	3285000	And so you see, now you can write this in an elegant way was a was a was a was a some sign, something over the two holes in the first wall, and then the three holes in the second wall and then you can see, you can put it now you put in all the combinations
3285000	3289000	here so you put E for one, and then you put.
3289000	3300000	So you have a one here and a one here and now you put a for alpha, and then B for F and then C for alpha you get the three first possibilities, and then you do it and then you get all the possibilities of going through this.
3300000	3311000	And so you have to find the probability of going from S to X, we have to, you have to identify all the combinations and sum them up.
3311000	3318000	And this is, and this is basically what what also happens in quantum computers in a way so so quantum computers.
3318000	3326000	And if you look at advanced quantum mechanics, then you have an integrated, because then you're not anymore looking at discrete past but you're looking at a continuum.
3326000	3332000	Right, but the beauty is, I can save you from the integral today, because quantum computing doesn't need the internet.
3332000	3351000	So quantum computing is this artificial world and artificial machine that that only looks at discrete states like you do it here. So this is a super do you understand this.
3351000	3362000	You understand this slide not the quantum computer stuff.
3362000	3372000	Yeah, you will see this is just a preview you will understand that but do you understand this first part that you have to add all the different paths together to get the total probability right.
3372000	3378000	And so this is this is this is what is done, and, and you will encounter this rotation very often now.
3378000	3389000	So now you see the explanation of the direct representation. This is one explanation. The real one is with it with a complicated integral but but this is what I showed last September but I won't show it.
3389000	3391000	Show it here because it makes no sense.
3391000	3393000	We would lose too much time.
3393000	3407000	So, so, how do we calculate the amplitude that we swear to get the probability so if you have two locations are one or two and the particle movement I wanted to as well as properties.
3407000	3418000	The magnitude, probably getting as a way with a wave number equal to the momentum divided by edge. So this is basically this, this shows you how to calculate this probability.
3418000	3433000	So you, you take the exponential function, you have the, the e from the unreal from the complex numbers, you have, you have momentum.
3433000	3445000	You have this distance divided by the plan constant and then you normalize it by this distance. And this is the probability of moving from I want to express in a in an amplitude so that's a proper amplitude.
3445000	3454000	And you can see why amplitude comes from because that is like what you get when you decompose sign and cosine into the exponential function you get this exponentially expression.
3454000	3462000	So, so remember the oil equation you all know the oil equation just shows you how you can decompose sign and cosine into into the exponential function.
3462000	3471000	And actually, this is just exponential function style of expression of the sine curve. So that's why it's the amplitude because it, and it depends of course, on the momentum.
3471000	3486000	So, so, so if you have a lot of momentum the amplitude will be higher. Right. And then you will, and then, and then, and then, and then this value becomes higher, and then you have a higher likelihood of coming from our one to our two with a high amplitude.
3486000	3497000	And so, and so this is the way it's a classical relationship between between the momentum and and mass which is the kinetic energy.
3497000	3509000	Now, now comes the next super interesting experience so the experiment was done already in the 19th century but for a very long time nobody could explain it at all.
3509000	3527000	And then there was another experiment. And now I'm skipping Max Planck's contribution, which was, which was, which was the quantization of electrons which was the being of quantum mechanics in 1905, but I'm skipping this because we can we don't have the time here, and I'm jumping ahead.
3527000	3543000	So I need to say this. So Max Planck has discovered that the electrons are not situated around the nucleus in atom in a continuous way, but that they are have probability levels, which are fixed.
3543000	3559000	These are the probability levels of the electron and if you look at the modern electron model, or an atom model, we know it's like this, that we have, that we have different levels at which the electrons may be that's a lithium or atom with three electrons and three protons.
3559000	3569000	And they can be at different levels of, of distance from from the, from the nucleus. And if they're more away from the distance they have higher energy levels.
3569000	3587000	And Max discovered that when the electron drops down, then a certain quantum of energy like it's emitted, and that this light is proportional not to its continuous function, but to a discrete function, quantum, the quantum of energy, not a continuous value.
3587000	3609000	So he didn't relate to great British physics had described a law that would use a continuous bunch. And it didn't work. It was incompatible with with reality. And so Planck looked at this experiment again and by great inner pain as he wrote to a friend, he had to accept as a continuous non continuous value nature.
3610000	3616000	Because basically physics always assumed that everything is continuous like the laws of Newton, you know, laws of motion.
3616000	3625000	And that is not suddenly a discrete amount that is there was all that's why for quantum, because there's a quantum of energy level.
3626000	3636000	So, so this was already known. But, and there were some, you know, I've been had also worked on the on the problem with, with his model of particle motion.
3636000	3649000	So there was already some stuff was done. But, but quantum mechanics was still not really kickstarted, you know, though Planck had already invented the electron quantization 1905, there was no quantum mechanical equations.
3649000	3662000	There was one that he had invented. Now, Sharon and Gallant and Frankfurt at the University of Frankfurt, they made an experiment where they, they had an oven that could create silver atoms.
3662000	3670000	So with a lot of heat they could evaporate the silver atoms. And then, then the silver things could move like this through a hole.
3670000	3681000	So we inside the vacuum of course so that they would not be disturbed. And then there was a big magnet was a strong flux upwards, the flux is made by making the magnet like this.
3681000	3685000	And then you know,
3685000	3689000	and the business medicine that electromagnetic.
3690000	3703000	What's wrong with me this morning. So anyhow, they were already the laws of electromagnetic system, allow you to build such a magnet that has a strong magnetic field upwards because of the shape of the magnet.
3703000	3707000	And so, sorry.
3707000	3709000	Thank you.
3709000	3720000	Maxwell's equations allow you to construct this, this magnet. And, and so, and so then they had a glass plate and the silver atoms were flying through this magnetic field.
3720000	3729000	And, and then they detected the deposits of the silver from this beam on the glass plate. And they expected to have a smear.
3729000	3741000	This is what I have indicated here in red. So classical physics was a continuous vertical component of, of the angular momentum would lead to vertical smear but they observed two points.
3741000	3752000	They were shocked. They were shocked, you know, because, because they thought that angular momentum. So why is, why are the, why are the silver atoms at all distorted by the magnetic field.
3752000	3757000	Because they have angular momentum themselves the egg types more magnets.
3757000	3770000	And so there are some sets. That's also why in iron you can have a man, if you put a magnet against iron the iron bar becomes a magnet itself because all the, the, the atoms the iron atoms have themselves as a sense of tiny magnets.
3770000	3776000	And they all arranged and sets in the same way so that you then then they become like a magnet, you know, every child knows it.
3776000	3800000	So, and so, so they saw that, that, that, that this property this property of being is more magnet which is called angular momentum would, would be continuous but it was, and then somebody realized that this was like with the quantization of the electrons in Planck's equation.
3800000	3810000	Right. And so, so they said, oh, this, this property that makes the students like magnets must also be discrete like the electrons on the screen.
3810000	3812000	So they discovered this.
3812000	3817000	And, and then they, they called this property the spin.
3817000	3833000	And, and spin is, is, is a, is a property of, of particles that lets them behave in a certain way magnetic field spin.
3833000	3835000	There's no translation.
3835000	3844000	And, and so it's maybe.
3844000	3851000	So I show you.
3851000	3858000	I don't need the English page but my browser set in a way to always show the German way one first but we'll go to the English now.
3858000	3871000	So, they call it an intrinsic form of angular momentum carried by elementary particles and sus by composite particles such as blah blah blah and that spin of one of the two types of angular momentum in quantum mechanics the other being orbital angular
3871000	3884000	momentum, the orbital angular momentum operators, blah, blah, blah, you don't need to. So basically, the spin is, it says the existence of electron spin angular momentum is inferred from experiments such as Zangala experiment.
3884000	3887000	But that's all we know about spin.
3887000	3892000	Right. So we have a mathematical model, mathematical model of spin we call it angular momentum.
3892000	3898000	But that's only because it's an energy to classical physics but as finally says, we don't know what spin is.
3898000	3912000	We can imagine it. Yeah, we just have we just have a mathematical model of it, which which is super accurate, but we don't know what it really is. It is what makes the electrons or the atoms fly in a certain way in the magnetic field.
3912000	3921000	That's all. But how it works, we don't know, we can't imagine it actually, you know, all the geometrical analog analog, we have our wrong.
3921000	3932000	This is the way to use our common sense view of the world to measure what spin is. Spin is just this, the behavior of the particles in the magnetic field. And this is, this is fine.
3932000	3942000	And this when I when I realized this very that was the idea of how I realized that nobody can explain what's been released. Then I found my uncle was asked what spin said exactly this.
3942000	3946000	Oh, I don't know nobody know.
3946000	3951000	So anyhow, let's continue here.
3951000	3957000	Do I still present the presentation on the screen can check.
3958000	3970000	Good. And so now you can with this he indicates the strong magnetic field in one direction this this is called flux.
3970000	3980000	And which is called this is the nappler operator that that is used to describe such a field and physically don't have to look at it.
3980000	3985000	And to you see now a different type of atom that is split into three beams.
3985000	3992000	So this is so silver split into two but atoms of spin one split into three beams.
3992000	4007000	And oh, let me look up so just for completeness what atom is has been through one.
4007000	4012000	And how I
4012000	4016000	the particles are divided into those which have been one and spin off and so on.
4016000	4017000	Yes.
4017000	4019000	Yes, please.
4019000	4028000	And, and, and so but there are atoms which have been one and they can be, and they can be split into three beams.
4028000	4035000	Now, if you see here, now we can imagine different standard apparatus, which has here inversion of the magnetic code.
4035000	4037000	So first it has no cells.
4037000	4042000	So the flux, and then the flux goes into the other direction and then it goes back to this direction.
4042000	4053000	So we are changing the direction of the flux in this experiment and now you see that in the first apparatus, we split the
4053000	4058000	beam into three and then we can put it together again in this apparatus.
4058000	4062000	And then, and then
4062000	4065000	it's changed in this apparatus and then put it together again here.
4065000	4073000	So, and now you can, you can imagine to put several such machines which are able to split and unify the beam.
4073000	4075000	So this splits and unifies the beam.
4075000	4082000	Now you can imagine that you put several of these in series but you can now put in a filter.
4082000	4096000	For example, for example, when you put, you have the first of these apparatus machines with a filter that filters out the minus and the, and the, and the negative and the zero spin beams of the office of the split beam.
4096000	4101000	You only get this and then if you put the second in here, only the plus will arrive.
4101000	4102000	Right.
4102000	4109000	And so, and so now you can develop a kind of, you know, alphabet to describe these machines.
4109000	4114000	So this would be a machine that splits and reassembles the, the atom beam.
4114000	4118000	This would one that splits it and reassembled it but that filters out to zero and minus.
4118000	4123000	This one filters out plus and minus this one filters out plus and zero.
4123000	4134000	And now you can say, you can calculate the amplitude to pass the various combinations of pure filters, and you can express them in matrix notation.
4134000	4151000	So here, this is the start state is the end state and now you want to know the likelihood of starting in plus as an ending up in plus as so this would be, we put, we put these two filters here in a row.
4151000	4160000	And then determine the likelihood that the iron that this beam, the plus beam is ending here. So there would be a second filter here. And that's of course one.
4160000	4166000	Why is it one because, because now after this filter I only have spin plus atoms left.
4166000	4173000	And when they go through the second apparatus, they are not hitting any obstacle right or even if there would be an obstacle here that gets through.
4173000	4181000	And so now you can have a matrix telling you the likelihood to pass from such a filter machine.
4181000	4197000	So for example, the likelihood to get from minus s to plus s is zero and the likelihood from zero s to plus s also so you can only get with such a symmetric apparatus, you can only get from plus s from the same as to the same as.
4197000	4211000	And you can also rotate the filters, and see, put the Stan gala filters in series, and then you get even other probabilities for the particles to pass through the filters.
4211000	4217000	And so now you can written, we can write.
4217000	4231000	Yes, this matrix that that describes how the particles goes through the filter. And now you can express this in terms of the likelihood of a particle to go from one state to another state.
4231000	4237000	And these states are now, and now remember that we had the some already here.
4237000	4242000	Right, this is the sum of going through both filters.
4242000	4253000	Or this was the sum. I meant this one, this sum of going with a certain path through both of the filters. Right. And now we can apply to these types of filters as well.
4253000	4271000	Let's say, so I have a certain, I go, I have, I have now let's say my three holds. And so now I have the probability of going from three to hold one and from hold one to he, and then hold two and hold three and if I three holds and I will have all the possibilities.
4271000	4291000	And, and, and, and this is, this is basically represented also as a matrix. So we said that with the filters we just saw we can only get from the same as to the same as, which means that only that in this matrix, when row and column are unequally have zero probability.
4291000	4298000	And when row and column have the same, we have what probability one, right. And so this is called the chronicle delta.
4298000	4314000	So the chronicle delta just says that you can only get a one in the matrix is J and I are equal, which, so row, row one and column one, row two and column two, row three and column three, and that gives you the probabilities of going through the filter system.
4314000	4332000	And here we have an example, a workout example of this going going through this, through this type of filter. And, and this uses that, I think it's complicated for today, but this uses the turned around filter that we had here.
4332000	4339000	And, and to model the turnaround filter, you need to calculate the complement.
4339000	4354000	So you, so when you square, when you want to know the probability of going from plus s to plus t, you need to, you need, and to square this, you need to multiply the probability with its complement.
4354000	4361000	The complement was this, which we saw here.
4361000	4378000	And it's also expressed with the style. So you need the complement where when you have a matrix compliment you it's a style and so, so this shows you that you need this complement and now, basically what we can see is that if this is supposed to be true now you can calculate this,
4378000	4396000	multiply this out, right, you can say this is this plus this plus this so these are the three possibilities s to plus t s to zero t s to minus t, and they all have to add up to one.
4396000	4406000	And at the same time, this also has up this year the part that without the trend, without the inversion also has to add up to one this is.
4406000	4424000	And so, these two equations are only consistent for all relative orientations of the T and the s apparatus is, if we have these law, if, if the, if the inverse of if all these inverts are true.
4424000	4437000	And so that means that actually this amplitude is always equals to the exchange amplitude of inverted.
4437000	4455000	And so, so these are basically using the filters, the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics arrived so the first one is the chronic a delta that was with that basically only the ones in the matrix, only the probabilities.
4455000	4477000	So that only these amplitudes are one. Then the next one is that to get this probability you need to add up all the past through the filters. And the third one says that that the inverse of this bracket is, is the same as the way when you when you
4477000	4482000	change the two target and the two, the two.
4482000	4493000	Yeah, the two location thank you and build the inverse and it's the same and without exchanging. And so this and so you can derive those three laws of quantum mechanics from the filter from the filter experiments.
4493000	4506000	And, and, and I think this is quite elegant and relatively simple to understand, and you can read it, read it up in the third volume of Feynman, I think it's chapter five in the third volume of his physics.
4507000	4521000	You can get it online. So if you if you go to five lectures on physics, you Google that, you come to a page at Caltech, where he gave the lectures in the 60s and there all the lectures are beautifully for free you can look at them.
4521000	4527000	They are really well, very well set up and chapter five explains all of this.
4527000	4541000	And, but, but basically, so I know very quickly, it takes a bit longer to do it properly but really quick I showed you, these are the three fundamental laws and this means I will do this a bit later.
4541000	4548000	But, but, but one very important aspect is the following. So if this is a location of a particle.
4548000	4568000	These are basic and basic locations, for example, in the three dimensional space with three dimensions, you can express one of the locations, or the one of the amplitude as a linear as a linear combination of the basis states so to take a complex number.
4568000	4578000	So one, you multiply by the first component, the second one by the second component, third by the third component, you add them up, and that gives you this number. So, and this is what this also shows.
4578000	4590000	So, when you want to go from the lab, they have the amplitude of going from that location to that location, basically you express each of the two locations in the base in the base dimensions.
4590000	4603000	And that's in the coordinate system of two coordinates. That's just like saying this year is this vector is just a combination of x and y.
4603000	4610000	So, so this is just z is just equals alpha y plus x.
4610000	4627000	Right, and this is so this is basically what is done here. So you are basically expressing a certain particle location as a linear combina or some other property as a linear combination of the basic coordinates.
4627000	4636000	So we could this is the one times x. So therefore there is no, there is no parameter here, but this is alpha y.
4636000	4650000	And, and, and so these complex numbers are just the parameters to express the location or the quantum property expressed by this cat using.
4650000	4666000	And by the way, why is it called bra cat, because, because these are brackets, right, these two are brackets, and then they call this one a bra, this one a cat, and at this time sexism was still although you know they were not woke yet.
4666000	4673000	So they were allowed to call it a bra. And nowadays it's still called a bra. And it's interesting.
4673000	4690000	And I've, this is no joke. I told this to my sister, she works in the cultural area she runs a beauty Institute, and she told me asked her to ask a gender professor at the faculty of mathematics or physics, and she tries to get rid of the brown, because he believes it's sexist.
4690000	4699000	So that's how where we've gotten but when the bracket occasion was, it was invented, you know, the man invented, we then was, was the rack.
4699000	4706000	And, and she just said, you know, these are brackets, I call this product is that he was a Frenchman so they invented the bra, you know, what do you expect.
4706000	4709000	So, so, so that's how it came about.
4709000	4728000	So, so, so this is, so now we have, we have gone through the very basics of quantum mechanics, and using the filters and other any questions to this.
4728000	4735000	It's a bit of mathematics but not very complicated.
4735000	4746000	Yeah, so I think, I think the best for you to do is to, is to, is to read this chapter and find them. I don't, I don't have this the time.
4746000	4764000	Yes. So, so, yes, so he's very in the best sense very Jewish. He's great. And, and he is. So the, the, the, for each, if you go to this web page for each, for each printed lecture that's also the video that you can watch.
4764000	4780000	It's really well, it's very fun. And, and so anyhow, but, but what you can take from this is that this filtering allows you the passing of the, of the beams of particles with the filter allows you to derive the basic laws of quantum mechanics and that
4780000	4792000	what was, that's what was actually done in a way you know that they use these types of experiments to derive the basic laws of quantum mechanics only that it didn't happen in the order that is presented in the book by Feynman.
4792000	4801000	So Feynman to explain it easily he then invented a new order in which it was of course not done in practice, but you know that's normal. So if you look at wire stress.
4801000	4812000	So, when wire stress started to systematize mathematics, he also invented a new order how each mathematical truth is based on on the basic axioms of piano.
4812000	4824000	And, and of course this carded the way that mathematics that evolves, you replace it by an artificial evolution of mathematics, that is now the way mathematics is taught in every textbook, but when he did it.
4824000	4839000	He ordered everything to make it more plausible in the way it evolves and, and, and so this is how Feynman does it as well. But basically it's always about can the particle reach another, another position, and what do I have to do to calculate this and this way you get to these basic laws.
4839000	4849000	I think before we do a bit more of, we are, we will finish the quantum mechanics part today, I promise, so that we can maybe do a bit of quantum computers already today or the rest tomorrow.
4849000	4854000	So now we do, we do a, how many, how much break can in this parent.
4854000	4860000	Yes, how many minutes.
4860000	4867000	We'll see you at five past 11.
4867000	4874000	So you, you haven't got words for your.
4874000	4880000	Some, some of you would say.
4910000	4939000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4939000	4968000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4969000	4973000	When we were talking about related things.
4973000	4975000	We're using quite a lot.
4975000	4979000	Just a bra or just a yes.
4979000	4980000	Yeah.
4980000	4984000	And today you have done that. Can you just remind me what just a bra would mean or just a bit.
4984000	4989000	Just a cat means.
4989000	4991000	Just a cat means.
4991000	4998000	Just a cat means the sum of the positions of the base state of the quantum system.
4998000	5001000	And you will see it much better here.
5001000	5005000	I'll jump to it.
5005000	5006000	This.
5006000	5009000	So this is, this is the quantum bit.
5009000	5013000	And, and you can see this is sorted to be a sphere.
5013000	5017000	We can sign up there is a quantum bit.
5017000	5024000	And now this sign is composed as a linear combination of the zero and the one state.
5024000	5029000	And so that are complex numbers which went square and together always give one.
5029000	5030000	Yeah.
5030000	5033000	And they determine where on the sphere you are.
5033000	5037000	So you see the zero and one is here the zeros of the other side.
5037000	5044000	And basically, and basically, depending on the linear combination of the two, you end up on the point of the sphere.
5044000	5050000	And it goes to the main point that.
5050000	5060000	infinitely infinitely many points that a quantum bit can take on. And that's what that's the point that that.
5060000	5064000	Like many, many people forget about what.
5064000	5069000	He seems to think that you can just have a bit is to put it is just like a bit.
5069000	5072000	Because when you measure it, you only get a zero or one.
5072000	5079000	But the problem is that physically that fun for each issue with infinitely many possibilities.
5079000	5088000	And when, and when we have several students together, you have to have a superposition pattern like the one I showed at the beginning of all these single cupids.
5088000	5097000	And so the way to super complex and I think the use of quantum computing is that you think the technical control control.
5097000	5100000	You know, but I think it's not possible to control the property.
5100000	5104000	It's also the complexity of the quantum waves to hide the quantum with the continuum.
5104000	5109000	And the bits, but the bits in the 64 bit computer, they are from a computer.
5109000	5112000	And they are always in the fine state.
5112000	5117000	And each of these is have been like another space.
5117000	5121000	And that's what the equation shows, especially the one on the bottom side.
5121000	5127000	You could suppose there's 10 divided by two times 10 zero plus.
5127000	5129000	He will see sign.
5129000	5132000	And can't hear me.
5132000	5134000	Can't even get one of the basic.
5134000	5136000	There's all of this.
5136000	5138000	They're location.
5138000	5140000	They're just the case.
5140000	5145000	But of course, how do you know where the base states are as it were.
5145000	5148000	You should be able to put the computer in the base.
5148000	5151000	So if you have a bottom rate to start at,
5151000	5157000	put it down to zero Kelvin and then you hope that they're all settled at zero.
5157000	5162000	And then you should blaze us against them or I need to put them into a higher.
5162000	5163000	Okay.
5163000	5166000	And we know we can't get down to absolute.
5166000	5169000	Yeah, that's all the bits are.
5169000	5171000	And that's what I wrote.
5171000	5173000	Yeah.
5173000	5176000	I was supported.
5176000	5178000	So when I write to me like this,
5178000	5180000	you always have to be professional and post.
5180000	5182000	Sometimes you have to follow me,
5182000	5185000	but always see what I really mean.
5185000	5188000	He was writing around.
5188000	5190000	Actually, it's a bit catalytic.
5190000	5192000	What was going to be.
5192000	5194000	So which are called, I know.
5194000	5196000	Good.
5196000	5199000	So let's continue.
5199000	5204000	Sorry.
5204000	5208000	So,
5208000	5212000	so I'm so this is
5212000	5215000	this shows you
5215000	5219000	kind of a precursor to the
5219000	5221000	to the Schrodinger equation,
5221000	5224000	which is an equation that describes
5224000	5228000	the the relationship between
5228000	5232000	the C, which I will explain a minute what it and and the Hamiltonian.
5232000	5234000	So what is this?
5234000	5238000	So C I of T is the likelihood to find
5238000	5240000	a particle
5240000	5243000	in step C in one of the base states.
5243000	5245000	So this is like what I said here.
5245000	5248000	So this could be a particle and
5248000	5250000	and see I
5250000	5253000	is the likelihood of finding it in one of the base states.
5253000	5256000	For example, the basic X, right?
5256000	5259000	The base states are modern as like co-ordinated in a coordinate
5259000	5263000	system and see I is the likelihood of finding
5263000	5266000	a particle in one of the base states.
5266000	5270000	And as you can see, this likelihood is
5270000	5272000	is is time dependent.
5272000	5274000	And so if you
5274000	5277000	had created computer derivative by T,
5277000	5280000	you would have the likelihood of summing up
5280000	5283000	over the different base states of the system
5283000	5285000	and adding them together.
5285000	5288000	So this sum is again reminds you of what you've seen here
5288000	5291000	that such amplitudes are always made up of sums
5291000	5295000	of the elements of the elements in the base states.
5295000	5300000	And this is this is a matrix that gives you the coefficients
5300000	5305000	with which you so these coefficients we saw here a coefficient, right?
5305000	5308000	The matrix gives you the coefficients for doing this in higher dimensions
5308000	5311000	than if you have only one dimension.
5311000	5317000	And so matrix H has to include the thing we are doing to the system
5317000	5319000	to cause it to change.
5319000	5322000	If you know the numbers that are in the matrix,
5322000	5326000	we have a complete description of the behavior of the system in time.
5326000	5330000	And Hamilton was the first who invented this matrix
5330000	5334000	as a way to calculate the position of particles
5334000	5336000	using classical mechanics.
5336000	5339000	So here there was a guy before me who was told I launched
5339000	5343000	and formalized Newton's law in the in a very elegant frame
5343000	5345000	using differential calculus.
5345000	5348000	And then Hamilton formalized it even more elegantly
5348000	5351000	with this matrix notation, matrix notation,
5351000	5353000	proper English.
5353000	5358000	And here you can see how the elements of the matrix are added
5358000	5362000	together, multiplied with this amplitude.
5362000	5366000	And that's a dagger to P because when he lived there was no photo yet.
5366000	5369000	So the precursor of the modern photography.
5369000	5371000	And I don't know why he's distorted.
5371000	5376000	He's not, he looks a bit better if he's not horizontally distorted.
5376000	5379000	So it has to do with the arrangement of the screen.
5379000	5382000	So the Hamiltonian is equal to its transpose complement.
5382000	5384000	So this star means transpose complement.
5384000	5386000	That's when you turn around the matrix
5386000	5389000	and exchange every element of the matrix with the complement,
5389000	5391000	which was in Z.
5391000	5394000	So that means when you, so you remember Z,
5394000	5404000	Z is equal to X plus E times Y and Z complement is X minus E times Y.
5404000	5408000	So then you have to take the matrix and replace all its elements,
5408000	5411000	turn it around like this and then replace all its elements
5411000	5415000	by the by their composites that that doesn't change the matrix.
5415000	5418000	So it's a, it's a unitary matrix and the total probability
5419000	5421000	is equal to its transpose complement.
5421000	5424000	And the total probability of finding a particle is,
5424000	5430000	is then the sum of each of the amplitudes.
5430000	5435000	And that's of course, that is independent of time.
5435000	5439000	And so now to make this a bit clear,
5439000	5442000	if we have only one single particle like an atom address.
5442000	5447000	So if you would freeze helium atom to zero Kelvin,
5447000	5451000	you would have to use a single atom address and it is in only one state.
5451000	5455000	So, and then you have to keep it frozen like this then the,
5455000	5458000	the physical circumstances are not changing with time.
5458000	5461000	And so age is an independent of time.
5461000	5463000	This now gives for one single value.
5463000	5467000	It gives you so, so the matrix,
5467000	5471000	bigger matrix of age, you know, contains, for example,
5471000	5475000	one times two matrices could put it H11, H12,
5475000	5478000	H21, H22.
5478000	5481000	But now we have a matrix with only one element,
5481000	5483000	which is, which is H1.
5483000	5489000	And so we say, for this single probability
5489000	5493000	or amplitude of CB in the one state the system may have.
5493000	5496000	If we calculate the derivative of this by time,
5496000	5500000	this is equal to the product of the first element of the matrix
5500000	5502000	multiplied by the value of C.
5502000	5506000	And so, and if, if not an H11 is constant,
5506000	5508000	then the solution is even simpler.
5508000	5510000	If you, if you now calculate the solution,
5510000	5514000	so this is differential equation because here you have a variable
5514000	5516000	and here is the differential of a variable one equation.
5516000	5518000	So that's called a differential equation.
5518000	5522000	The solution of this is another equation and this is C1 is E,
5522000	5527000	the exponent of E divided by H times 11, H11 times T.
5527000	5532000	And so, so this is, and E is also called,
5532000	5535000	the matrix H is also called the energy matrix
5535000	5538000	because E one model is the energy here, right?
5538000	5543000	So this is, you saw this earlier with momentum P
5543000	5546000	and that's another form of momentum together
5546000	5548000	with mass gives you the energy
5548000	5550000	and this is also form of expressing the energy.
5550000	5554000	So this is the quantum mechanical expression
5554000	5557000	of a system with one state.
5557000	5562000	And now here we have, we have, if we have a two state system,
5562000	5565000	so this is the ammonia molecule
5565000	5570000	and the ammonia molecule, maybe I should read this out first.
5570000	5571000	This is so funny.
5571000	5573000	Now this molecule like any other has an infinite,
5573000	5575000	infinite number of states.
5575000	5577000	It can spin around any possible axis.
5577000	5578000	It can be moving in any direction,
5578000	5581000	can be vibrating inside and so on and so on.
5581000	5583000	It is therefore not the two state system at all,
5583000	5585000	but we want to make an approximation
5585000	5587000	that all other states remain fixed
5587000	5589000	because they don't enter into what we are concerned with
5589000	5590000	at the moment.
5590000	5594000	This is very strong in physics all the time.
5594000	5597000	Problems get simplified to one aspect of the system
5597000	5600000	that is interesting and all the rest is abstracted away.
5600000	5602000	We will consider only that the molecule is spinning
5602000	5605000	around its axis of symmetry as shown in the figure
5605000	5607000	that it has zero translational momentum
5607000	5609000	that is vibrating as little as possible.
5609000	5611000	And so you see, you have this axis here,
5611000	5613000	the molecule is spinning around it
5613000	5615000	and now it has two states,
5615000	5618000	either with the nitrogen atom up
5618000	5620000	or it can spin around like this
5620000	5622000	and then the nitrogen is down.
5622000	5623000	That's the second state.
5623000	5626000	So this is state one and this is state two.
5626000	5631000	And so if we express this with the Hamiltonian,
5631000	5634000	we see we have basically two equations.
5634000	5638000	We have this equation describing the likelihood
5638000	5640000	of being in state one.
5640000	5644000	And this is the likelihood of being in state two.
5644000	5647000	And you see that now you have a more complicated Hamiltonian
5647000	5650000	with four entries.
5650000	5656000	I messed up the notation here, should be like this, of course.
5656000	5659000	And so now you see that the likelihood
5659000	5662000	of each of the two states is composed
5662000	5664000	as a linear combination of the two states
5664000	5667000	with these parameters which are usually complex numbers.
5667000	5669000	What is important to me?
5669000	5672000	It seems to me it's just about clockwise
5672000	5674000	and anti-clockwise spinning.
5674000	5675000	No.
5675000	5676000	It's upward.
5676000	5677000	It's up or down.
5677000	5679000	In both cases, anti-clockwise spinning.
5679000	5682000	You see the arrow points into this arrow here.
5682000	5685000	It's the same as both times anti-clockwise spinning.
5685000	5688000	But here the nitrogen is pointing up
5688000	5690000	and here the nitrogen is pointing down.
5690000	5692000	So it's about the orientation of the nitrogen
5692000	5694000	with regard to the spinning axis.
5695000	5699000	Yeah.
5699000	5702000	Does this have anything to do with spin?
5702000	5703000	No.
5703000	5705000	This is interesting.
5705000	5712000	So this example shows you that you can regard
5712000	5714000	any property as quantum mechanical property
5714000	5716000	and call it a state.
5716000	5718000	So here we have two base states of the molecule.
5718000	5720000	We have the base state nitrogen pointing up
5720000	5722000	and the other base state nitrogen pointing down.
5722000	5727000	They are now in this physics as theater reduction
5727000	5729000	one to two states.
5729000	5733000	Another situation, it's the spin up or down.
5733000	5736000	Another situation is the polarization of a photon.
5736000	5741000	In another situation, it may be the level of the electron
5741000	5746000	on the blank model of the atom and so on.
5746000	5749000	So you can always select other properties of the system
5749000	5753000	to look at, call them quantum states, and then calculate them.
5753000	5760000	This may be a good time to mention about paper.
5760000	5761000	Barry and I wrote a paper.
5761000	5763000	I can put it up on screen.
5763000	5765000	You mean the quantum one.
5765000	5768000	So which you might find interesting to read.
5773000	5777000	Just appeared on a heave.
5777000	5779000	So I should be able to find this way.
5779000	5780000	Yes, this is it.
5780000	5782000	They all know what our heave is, I guess.
5782000	5783000	Yes.
5783000	5785000	So they don't review paper.
5785000	5790000	It's a six or they publish it out of paper.
5790000	5795000	And I know the director of our heave personally
5795000	5799000	and I can see it's involved in the possible random change.
5799000	5803000	And he told me that the six weeks would not spend
5803000	5806000	on evaluating the quality of the paper.
5806000	5811000	It was spent on deciding on the which category it should go.
5811000	5815000	I don't know the end.
5815000	5819000	No, history and philosophy of physics.
5819000	5824000	And so this is the, this is the on your paper.
5824000	5833000	And it's, it gives you an ontology of physics and it uses
5833000	5835000	and it also does this for quantum mechanics
5835000	5840000	so basically our idea was to give an ontology
5840000	5843000	to show an ontology of classical physics
5843000	5845000	so classical mechanics and then quantum mechanics
5845000	5849000	to show that our ontological approach can cover both time
5849000	5851000	both types of physics.
5851000	5856000	So anyhow, so, so this now here these two states are selected
5856000	5857000	as a base state.
5857000	5861000	Therefore the matrix describe combinations of the two base states.
5861000	5864000	And when you multiply elements of the matrix with the two states
5864000	5869000	then together you obtain probabilities of being in that state.
5869000	5874000	And, and so this is this is basically why only probabilities
5874000	5877000	because as you know quantum mechanics is only probabilistic.
5877000	5883000	So which is off now.
5883000	5891000	And, and so this is this is what this is what it's about.
5891000	5900000	Now, here it's, it's again, it's, it's described in bracket notation.
5900000	5905000	So, so this is C, the state you're interested in.
5905000	5911000	This is so to speak, the empty sheet of C being in state one,
5911000	5913000	plus the amplitude of C being in state two,
5913000	5916000	multiplied with the parameter of that state.
5916000	5920000	So this is a linear combination that expresses this state
5920000	5924000	in terms of the two of the two base states one and two.
5924000	5926000	So this is basic one is basically.
5926000	5931000	And this is super important right so this basically gives you an idea
5931000	5936000	how in quantum mechanics the state of a system is always expressed
5936000	5940000	as a linear combination of the basic states and if you have a full
5940000	5944000	flat quantum system which we can't calculate with, you don't have a sum
5944000	5948000	but you have an integral over infinitely many states so the full quantum
5948000	5952000	description would be a Hilbert space of infinite dimension and this is
5952000	5955000	just a two dimensional Hilbert space.
5955000	5958000	And so, so this is just what I wanted to demonstrate with this atom,
5958000	5962000	which is a molecule of ammonium.
5962000	5964000	Now.
5964000	5968000	So I want to summarize the laws of quantum mechanics one more time.
5968000	5972000	So, C and C are states of the electron or state of the system.
5972000	5975000	One, two, three, four are the base states.
5976000	5981000	So the base states are orthogonal so which means that we have a matrix
5981000	5984000	which is only filled with ones on the diagonal and there's no likelihood
5984000	5988000	at all to grow from one state, from one base state to the other,
5988000	5992000	but only from one base state to one base state to the same base state.
5992000	5996000	C can be described as a linear combination of the amplitude of all the base states.
5996000	5998000	These are all the base states.
5998000	6004000	And now I say C might be amplitude C to be instead one times this complex
6004000	6007000	number, two, three, four are the atoms together.
6007000	6010000	And then I can like we did it here.
6010000	6012000	Yeah, this is like here.
6012000	6016000	And so this way we get this linear combination.
6016000	6020000	And if we consider any two states C and C, the amplitude of the state C
6020000	6025000	will also be, to be also be in the state C can be found by projecting the state C
6025000	6030000	into the base states and then projecting from each base state into the state C.
6030000	6037000	So this is C to one, one to three, C to two, two to three, C to three and so on.
6037000	6040000	Some all together this gives you the total probability.
6040000	6046000	And this is again what we showed at the very beginning with this analogy of the
6046000	6048000	matrix lit whole.
6048000	6050000	I said this equation is so important.
6050000	6051000	Where is this bloody hell?
6051000	6052000	Here.
6052000	6056000	This is so important because this already gives you the idea why you have to sum up
6056000	6059000	all these different amplitudes.
6059000	6065000	Okay, now we, we are almost, this is the first law.
6065000	6072000	And then there's another very important aspect.
6072000	6077000	So, if X n is a local state of the party, then we can define the amplitude of being
6077000	6082000	the state as this, since the base states are associated with the location on the line,
6082000	6087000	we can think of the amplitude C n as a function of the coordinate X and the write it as C X
6087000	6088000	n.
6088000	6092000	And C X n will in general vary with time and are therefore also front of the so we obtain
6092000	6093000	this.
6093000	6094000	Right.
6094000	6098000	And this is now basically the river.
6098000	6103000	Simon tries to derive the, the screening equation in a soft way, but we are not going
6103000	6104000	to go through this.
6104000	6107000	So what have we learned so far.
6107000	6113000	This is the kind of very important summary of the difference between classical physics
6113000	6114000	and quantum mechanics.
6114000	6121000	So in classical physics, you have a phase space with individual points.
6121000	6128000	To make this bigger.
6128000	6131000	Oh, this is actually better, isn't it.
6131000	6135000	Yes, now you can sense.
6135000	6139000	I would like to show you how Hamilton, he looks so much like a frog but he looks better but
6139000	6140000	he looks better.
6140000	6144000	So, so classical mechanics makes use of a phase space whose individual points represent possible
6144000	6146000	states of a physical system.
6146000	6150000	And, and with some with subsets of points representing physical properties.
6150000	6158000	So for example, you all know that that in a classical system, you don't have any, any
6158000	6167000	irrational, sorry, complex numbers, but you have, but you have
6167000	6171000	only, for example, classical ordinance system and then you have a point, some like another
6171000	6177000	point that you have locations defined of the point and also can define if it's a moving
6177000	6183000	body, you can only find location and given time, but you can also let's say define its
6183000	6184000	momentum.
6184000	6189000	And then with time and momentum, you have a phase space defining where the point is and
6189000	6191000	how fast it is moving.
6191000	6192000	Right.
6192000	6196000	And, and so this is the facelift of classical mechanics.
6196000	6201000	Quantum mechanics use the complex silvered space and physical properties correspond to
6201000	6202000	subspaces.
6202000	6206000	And so a one dimensional subspace is what we call the state.
6206000	6207000	Right.
6207000	6210000	And so such a one dimensional suspect is a line.
6210000	6216000	And it's called a ray in quantum mechanics at one ray is what is so what is a senior
6216000	6220000	senior point in classical physics is not a ray in quantum physics.
6220000	6225000	And the ray expresses that that you can take.
6225000	6237000	We had it here was a was a very simple Hamiltonian where this is only H1 here.
6237000	6242000	And this equation, we multiply this with one complex number.
6242000	6247000	But if we, but, but we can have infinitely many complex number with which we can come
6247000	6248000	by the sea.
6248000	6250000	And by doing this, we get a line.
6250000	6251000	Right.
6251000	6253000	So if you multiply by one, we get a value.
6253000	6256000	If you might go to another value and another and another.
6256000	6260000	And so because they're infinitely many complex numbers, we can imagine that, that we can
6260000	6265000	basically parameterize the, the particle to be everywhere on the ray.
6265000	6268000	So the ray is what is the point.
6268000	6272000	So, so that means that in quantum mechanics, there is no single point where anything is,
6272000	6274000	but there's always a ray.
6274000	6275000	And.
6275000	6276000	And.
6277000	6278000	Yes.
6278000	6281000	Doesn't that contradict the quantum idea?
6281000	6287000	No, because, because when you measure the particle, you get a likelihood of it.
6287000	6292000	And the quantization that you're always going to occurs by the plan constant.
6292000	6295000	So we've seen the plan constant.
6295000	6298000	Because, because.
6298000	6300000	Where is it?
6300000	6303000	Where's an equation that contains the plan constant here?
6303000	6304000	Right.
6304000	6310000	So we have here the plan constant in this exponent, but we can still get an infinite,
6310000	6313000	infinite number of, of, of points.
6313000	6317000	They're just based in a certain way because the plan constant.
6317000	6318000	Right.
6318000	6323000	So the quantization comes in by the plan constant, which expresses that only at certain regular
6323000	6327000	intervals, we get so that we can measure quantum phenomenon.
6327000	6332000	But, but, but basically it's still aligned because there are infinitely many values of
6332000	6333000	age.
6333000	6335000	So, so that's.
6335000	6341000	So there is a line, but we can only measure certain discrete points along the line.
6341000	6342000	Yes.
6342000	6343000	Exactly.
6343000	6344000	Exactly.
6344000	6348000	And, and this is why, why the atom, and this is when we build a standard data apparatus
6348000	6353000	that splits the beam, we basically have such a measuring machine that measures two discrete
6353000	6355000	points.
6355000	6362000	But, but, but we must imagine that, that, that the particle itself can of course be anywhere,
6362000	6368000	but, but with our experimental setting, we can only measure certain points and, and, and
6368000	6370000	this is a quantization.
6370000	6377000	And now, now.
6377000	6383000	So now the, the, the logical negation is testing mechanics, the logical negation of the property
6383000	6389000	P, the corresponds to set of points B in space phase page, which is to say the property
6389000	6398000	not P is represented by the set theoretic complement PC of the set P. So here you see this.
6398000	6400000	But in quantum, no, it's actually.
6400000	6406000	So, so this is the point, for example, a certain point, and the complement all the other points
6406000	6411000	in the face space where the particle is not important mechanics is different quantum case.
6411000	6415000	The negation is an orthogonal complement of the subspace.
6415000	6424000	So here we have, here we have, for example, a ray, which is spin in Z direction, and its
6424000	6428000	negation is the orthogonal spin in Z minus direction.
6428000	6436000	So in quantum mechanics, a negation is an orthogonal ray orthogonal to the ray I was to the first
6436000	6438000	ray.
6438000	6448000	And so, so you, now you have to think of, of the collection of all vectors in the space that are
6448000	6452000	orthogonal to the, to every vector in the subspace as a complement.
6452000	6458000	And if P is a projector onto P, it's negation is present by the vector projector one mind one minus P.
6458000	6460000	So this is kind of how this works.
6460000	6468000	And this is a picture trying to depict that the quantum space, the basic dimensions, the states are raised.
6468000	6475000	And now, so there's a very different profound difference between classical and quantum properties, which is
6475000	6480000	illustrated by considering a two dimensional here but space representing possible properties of a spin off particle.
6480000	6484000	So spin off particle is schematically shown on the right.
6484000	6493000	The line P through the origin is a physical property of spin of the positive spin one half in units of the plank constant.
6493000	6496000	Again, this is where the quantization comes in.
6496000	6506000	The line P perpendicular to this line is orthogonal complement and represents physical property of spin minus one half in the Z direction.
6506000	6518000	One point is that there are many other lines through the origin such as Q, which is now the spin in directly X.
6518000	6528000	And they are neither the same as the property as Z, which is a spin in the Z direction, nor it's negation Z that minus one form.
6528000	6541000	And you can see here that also there is of course a complement to X, which would be X minus which would be now here, right. And so you have infinitely many angles in which you can measure the spin.
6541000	6544000	And each gives you a spin and a counter spin.
6544000	6553000	You know you have infinitely many. And so you have infinitely many possibilities of determining the location of the point.
6553000	6561000	And so this is, this is very important. And what we say in quantum mechanics is we have two properties.
6561000	6576000	For example, P and Q, they are in copper they are in there are in copper incompatible when the projectors onto the corresponding subspace do not commute so when P times two is not two times P.
6576000	6591000	And when we don't have commuting operators, then you have a situation that legs is precise analog and classical physics, for example, entanglement, and we will understand entanglement in a bit, but quantum entanglement entanglement doesn't allow such a subspace commutation.
6591000	6601000	And so if there's no such commutation, then we have, then we can't, we can't have an analog in classical physics.
6601000	6609000	And so this evolution from the Stern-Gannach apparatus to Schrödinger finding his famous equation took only five years.
6609000	6620000	And it was a great historical moment, marking the birth of the quantum mechanical description of matter. It occurred when Schrödinger first wrote down his equation for many years, internal atomic structure of matter had been a great mystery.
6620000	6628000	No one had been able to understand what had mattered together, why there was a chemical binding and especially how it could be that atoms could be stable.
6628000	6641000	So this discovery of the proper equations of motion of electrons on an atomic scale, provided a theory from which atomic phenomena could be calculated positively, accurately and in detail in principle.
6641000	6653000	And so that was why it was such a big revolution because suddenly could calculate exactly why hydrogen atom is stable and which different variants of hydrogen atom exist.
6653000	6664000	So you thought helium and tritium could also be calculated, and also the helium atom. And so the equation is capable of explaining all atomic phenomena except those involving magnetism and relativity.
6664000	6681000	And the energy level of an atom and all the effects of chemical binding. So, this is so, so affected and, you know, effective that now there are quantum simulators that can simulate the binding of a ligand to a protein.
6681000	6700000	And if you know the chemical structure of a protein, so it's amino acids how they are constituted in space. And you notice exactly, and you know where you know which electrons residues are, you can use Schrödinger equation systems to calculate to try to predict the position of a ligand towards these
6701000	6709000	You have to then again abstract a little bit, but, but this is really fascinating that you can now do calculations about matters so precisely.
6709000	6720000	But it's only true in principle because soon the mathematics becomes too complicated to solve exactly any but the simplest problems only the hydrogen helium atoms have been calculated to high accuracy.
6720000	6727000	So there's approximations some fairly sloppy time this says some fairly sloppy is so lovely.
6727000	6735000	What many of the facts of more complicated atoms and of chemical binding of molecules can also so in quantum chemistry.
6735000	6746000	You have to simplify a bit but you can still use the quantum principle to calculate relationships of matter and it's very fascinating. And that was possible to to to the Schrodinger equation.
6746000	6753000	It's very fascinating because it takes a day to to teach it how to get them.
6753000	6773000	Now, we know we have already had a superposition a superposition is that the quantum particle is not in one of the base states by I, but that it is a combination like I showed here for two, for just to stay combination of the values.
6773000	6786000	It has in the two states. So, so if it's projected on the state and this is a quantum superposition, and basically all quantum in a quantum computer, all quantum bits are into the position state.
6786000	6799000	So there is there are I mean, when you measure a quantum bit as we will see in a while, you obtain a pure state, an approximation of a pure state, but it's not really a pure state.
6799000	6807000	So that means that that that if you let's say you have to base state like in a qubit. And now you measure it.
6807000	6820000	You get almost zero almost one, but you will have still a very tiny complex number in front of the other parameter. So you have something like 0.999999 times one state or 0.001 times the other.
6820000	6825000	So you don't get a, so you have always superposition in quantum.
6825000	6837000	And that's why they are always a that's why it's a rail line, right, because you have infinitely many points. However,
6837000	6854000	there's something else and superposition, which is entanglement. And so, let me explain to you what entanglement is so entangled particles can be prepared experimentally for example you can take a photon and polarize it
6854000	6863000	generate a pair of low energy spin one half photons. Oh yes, I want to give you an example of a spin one particle photon has been one.
6863000	6872000	Yeah, so photon has been one, and you can get out of it you can get two weak energy photons of spin one whole.
6872000	6882000	And here. And so, so the two spin one half particles here you have particle a and b, then the superposition of states.
6882000	6894000	So if the x direction spin up is measured for particle C one, then spin down is always measured for particle C two, even if they're far apart.
6894000	6899000	And this is also true for.
6900000	6913000	I think wrong rotation but it doesn't matter now so I this should be C one C two but, but basically you see that the first particle has x has is is a mixture.
6913000	6933000	No, these are the two particles no that was correct. So these are I just to think about a bit so. So, this is the first particle this is the second particle the first particle has x spin up and the second x spin down.
6933000	6946000	And so this is, this is the, this is that that this particle has the opposite states, then this particle right and this means the combination of the two spaces called the 10th one.
6946000	6956000	And, and so, if you measure now this particle in x direction, it will have x direction up.
6956000	6964000	You always have the opposite direction. But if you don't measure one of the particle, you don't know one which one has been up and which one has been down.
6964000	6976000	And now the interesting thing is, if you produce a two particles and take them away from each other very far, and do the measurement on one then you always have the opposite measurement of the other.
6976000	6989000	And that has that that is called non locality of quantum mechanics, though, you know, the point is that when you create the party basically encode already this opposite information.
6989000	7003000	Now if you take them apart and measure one particle, then the other one always has the opposite, and they can't communicate because they're so far apart that even if they could only communicate by some unknown means above the speed of light now we know that the speed
7003000	7012000	that can be attained in the universe. So basically, you take them so far apart that they cannot communicate and then you do this measurement and you find out that the spin is opposite.
7012000	7024000	And this is called entanglement and the question is, how can this be how can it be that we don't know which part of this which that but we know it upon measurement we don't understand this, but we can describe it with this equation.
7025000	7042000	And so, and so these these states are incompatible right so so what does this mean so
7042000	7046000	that is messed up.
7046000	7054000	The quantum part of the face space is here by space age a complex vector space with an inner product an element of age.
7054000	7067000	Here to be here is denoted as psi the inner product is written like this.
7068000	7074000	So that it doesn't mess itself up again.
7074000	7078000	It's not groupable it's such a city software.
7078000	7086000	You see that's the consequence of Microsoft having the monopoly on this so they don't have to make an effort to make it really good.
7086000	7102000	And so the inner product that's it's like and so the counterpart of a point in classical phase space is a one dimensional subspace of Hilbert space array consisting of all multiple C times C of some some non zero C to see an arbitrary complex
7102000	7117000	and I've explained this. So this is why it's aligned because we can have infinitely many C's arrays returned by the attic operator so you can, you can basically say this year this pet bra determines array in linear algebra notation.
7117000	7124000	And so, if you take this, if you take the operator and apply to a cat, then you get this.
7124000	7135000	And, and this, this basically allows you to measure to measure quantum quantum magnitudes.
7135000	7153000	So, this is a certain interpretation of quantum mechanics invented by on this and Griffiths. We don't have to go into this now but basically, I just want to explain a bit to you so, so that you know what a projector is so if you have two projectors P and q that
7154000	7159000	describe some properties like for example spin in x and spin in y direction.
7159000	7176000	And if the two projectors commute so their products are for is a change with the order of it is changeable, then they commute and only when this conditions fulfilled the product itself is a projector, and it projects into a subspace P and q in a grid with quantum
7176000	7192000	but if it's not like this. So, then the conjunction P and q is meaningless in the sense that the history interpretation assigns it no meaning in other words, one cannot assign two incompatible properties to one quantum system at the same time so therefore
7192000	7211000	you can't interpret the singlet entanglement because let's see the singlet entanglement this year. This is the thing that entanglement where you have two photons which I entangled one in the one point one action the other in the other direction and now you
7211000	7228000	this is again way of expressing this expression of this of this of this and now let's look at states A and B. So, a projector a tensor B is a tensor this is the matrix filled with once times this.
7228000	7244000	This is the matrix which represents a property of the other product product space a tensor B is the conjunction of the separate properties of the subsets and A and B. So, so basically, you have, you have to raise which describe a property of the system like the spin direction.
7244000	7263000	A tensor B, then you basically have the conjunction of these properties so that means a particle having both being being projected to with this projector has both properties for example, spin a and positive and spin B.
7263000	7286000	Negative is, is, is the commuting operator, which, which assigns a projector to the particles A and B. And basically it says particle A is the spin direction positive and particle B is x spin direction negative so you could say if you have a standard range like this.
7286000	7301000	That is the z direction the particles lies like this. If you turn it by maybe 45 degrees, you get x direction of the particle to be separated like this, you know, and so this and so if you do this on two different particles if you're two different
7301000	7313000	particles, one has gone through one standard gap apparatus the other ones with the other. Now both can be assigned assigned the spins to these particles and that's perfectly perfect but in the entanglement.
7313000	7334000	In this projector, there is no projector that commutes. And therefore, we cannot. So if we project something into this singlet entanglement, there is no commute there is no, there is no such tender product and if there's no tender product, we cannot say anything about the spin of a or B.
7335000	7353000	In, in the direction unless you measure the z direction but we can't say anything about any other direction because of the entanglement. And, and so, and so this, this just is to show you that mathematically.
7353000	7361000	So, those, those paradoxical one would say it corresponds to state for which we have non commuting projectors and, and this.
7361000	7370000	Why am I showing this to you because we get to project us with the quantum computers, and, and we will also be with entanglement there.
7370000	7373000	So, what time is it now.
7373000	7377000	If we still want to talk and we want to talk with right.
7377000	7380000	So, yes.
7381000	7388000	Well, I do, I will do what I think I will do is at least the quantum bits.
7388000	7391000	So, so now we have.
7391000	7395000	Yes.
7395000	7399000	Or does anyone understand entanglement.
7399000	7407000	To be fair, there is a lot of people that I'm not planning to take way too long probably to.
7413000	7426000	So, let me see if I can describe the scenario we have a photon which we split into two photons, one of which has a spin and the other which has a complimentary spin.
7426000	7433000	And we send the second spot on thousands of miles away.
7433000	7435000	Yes. Yes.
7435000	7438000	And then we change the spin of the first proton.
7438000	7443000	And even though there's no way in which they can be communicating with each other.
7443000	7445000	No, we don't change it. We measure it.
7445000	7447000	We measure it.
7447000	7450000	So, so maybe to make it one more.
7450000	7462000	I think I miss I expected when I first saw this equation so what we see here are this equation described to spin in x direction this equation described to spin in the directions.
7462000	7474000	These are two different singlet entanglements one with regard to x, one with regard to the spin. Okay, so they are both are describing different Stern gala apparatus if you would like so.
7474000	7489000	And this year, this, this is one state of particles and B in which a has been up and B has been down. This is the other state of particles and B where a has been down and B has been up so a and B others are part of this.
7489000	7500000	I think I got this wrong last time. So this is, and so we and so the what this expresses is that there is basically a mixed state between this tensor and this tensor.
7500000	7510000	This tensor describing a being spin up this tensor side describe B being spin down, and this tensor describing x being spin down and x being spin up.
7510000	7523000	Now, when we make the measurement, we discover that x is a spin up, then we know that these always been down, though now they are, they are separate geographically.
7523000	7538000	And if we discover that it's been down and be a spin up, then we then we will always be up so this and the same in the direction. However, the two projectors, these projectors don't really commute.
7538000	7544000	Although there's a tensor product shown you the projectors corresponding to these don't commute as is shown here. Right.
7544000	7555000	So, so this tensor product of a and B commutes doesn't commute.
7555000	7557000	Projects.
7557000	7566000	So this is a project on to a B with C but only commutes with the project is zero and one on a and B, but it doesn't commute with with the tensor product.
7566000	7575000	And so though there is a tensor indicated here there is no mathematical commutation, because you cannot change the order of the two projectors mathematically.
7575000	7581000	And so therefore, that's what on this and and
7581000	7592000	I would just say, therefore, this is not an interpretive mistake. Right. So you can't because non projecting not really project which are measurements of the front of state.
7592000	7605000	Projectors mean that there is no way to assign days that the that the that the tensor product doesn't need to assign to reliable properties to the particles in question.
7605000	7608000	The particles in question.
7608000	7618000	The, the, the, the tensor product of the project doesn't assign interpretable property to the particles in question.
7618000	7627000	And so that's you can see here because you don't know unless you do a measurement you don't know which of the particles it's been up and you only know that they are anti-sensical.
7627000	7650000	And this is the paradox that you can have a quote on, quote on being changed in some way in one part of the universe, it writes to an equal often an opposite change in another quote on this paradox is eliminated by Griffith.
7650000	7670000	It's just, it's just, it just says that basically, the, the entanglement has no, it's uninterpreted, uninterpretable, and my interpretation in this case is that we created the entanglement with the machine that created the entangled photons.
7670000	7682000	But we, because we don't understand what's really going on, we can just say there is an entanglement but we don't know in which direction which photon is and this gets only revealed.
7682000	7686000	When, when we measure the photos.
7687000	7693000	The properties, let's say, take the spin and the X.
7693000	7698000	Is this property dependent or independent of the spin and the Z.
7698000	7708000	Yeah, so that's very good question. So they are not only independent, they are, they are totally for the same particle, they are mutually exclusive.
7708000	7717000	And that's because of the, that's another instance of the Heisenberg principle, that's why I introduced other principle. So if I measure the spin in the X direction.
7717000	7723000	I can't measure anymore the spin is the direction because I have the, what's called the collapse of the wave function.
7724000	7739000	And that means that, that I don't have a wave anymore after the measurement that is like the way before that I now have information about this particle in with regard to a certain dimension but I can't obtain it anymore for
7739000	7758000	for, for another dimension. And it's basically like the particle, I sense a particle source, and now it hits it split and it hits the screen I see it on the screen but now it has lost its properties, because now it's not anymore flying in the beam but it's
7758000	7767000	it has now condensed on the glass plate right so now I have information about it which spin its head, but I've lost the quantum system the way it's not anymore way.
7767000	7776000	It has now become a physical piece of dust that I see on the glass plate. And so in this way I've destroyed the wave character of the particle by measuring it.
7776000	7787000	And this is what happens here as well and you can only measure in one in one, the spin one dimension that's why on the quantum computer, you only measure always in one dimension.
7787000	7790000	You can't afterwards the particle is sort of be gone.
7790000	7803000	But then he said, given that there is an infinite amount of angles on which we can measure spin that the particle has an infinite amount of independent exclusive properties.
7803000	7806000	Yes, yes.
7806000	7813000	This is very clever statement. And this we will see at tomorrow at the end of the lecture when we get to maybe we are faster.
7813000	7830000	And that's by the way this infiniteness is expressed by the by the by the index w. So you know that you have x, y and z. These are three axis, but if I spin my hand like this they can be anywhere on the sphere right and w expresses this that they are arbitrary right and now and now.
7830000	7842000	So one qubit has, has an infinite amount in infinite amount of is a continuous variable, it can have an infinite amount of combinations.
7842000	7851000	And, and so that's the fundamental difference between the quantum computer and the classical computers, the classical computer there's electricity on the channel or not on the gate or not.
7851000	7864000	And if there's no electricity zero, if there is electricity it's one. And, and sometimes you can also have have errors in in single bit measurements but but this taking a side.
7864000	7877000	Basically, in a, in a quantum computer each qubit has an infinite amount of a fair of possible instances, but when you measure, you can only measure one.
7877000	7890000	And the problem is how do you before you the measurement. How do you manipulate this infinite amount before you do your measurement and keep it so that you get the regularities that you want in a gated circuit.
7890000	7902000	Right, because in a classically gated circuit everything is regular, according to the laws of bullet logic, but how do you want to maintain this regularity in a quantum computer and that that's what we are going to think about.
7902000	7921000	So, on the griffids have a relatively sober human entanglement, but there are some people who think that we can use quantum entanglement in order to do quantum communication over long distances, in a way which will be preventing people listening to the outside.
7921000	7923000	Yes, yes.
7923000	7926000	Do those people have a point.
7926000	7937000	Yes, so so we can, we can already, we can already do it now for short distances, because we can use the entanglement and I could I don't, I have to, but I didn't prepare this.
7937000	7951000	It's called quantum teleportation so that the entanglement. So when basically there's a circuit that that or an experiment to set up where you can basically prepare a particle.
7951000	7964000	And then you can send this particle to another party.
7964000	7980000	You can then measure yourself the particle and give this other part of the measurement result and then this measurement result is meaningless to anyone who doesn't have the particle but if you combine this measurement result with the particle you can then decipher the code.
7980000	7996000	So this quantum entanglement can indeed be used for secure communication because you don't even have to encrypt the the transmitted measurement result anymore because somebody who doesn't have the particle will not be able to do anything with it because there are infinitely many possibilities.
7996000	8002000	And you have picked one and now this is this property is used for the other to decipher the particle.
8002000	8009000	So with this you could, you can create quantum communication. The big problem with this is that we don't have quantum repeaters.
8009000	8026000	And so, because quantum particles lose their properties when they get transported over after a certain time, you would have to have a quantum repeater that basically measures the property of the particle, and then recreate the particle in exactly the same way and transport it to the next
8026000	8033000	quantum repeater so that you always freshen the particle, the informant and we don't know how to build such quantum repeaters.
8033000	8047000	So, so therefore right now the dream of, of secure communication by quantum teleportation as it's called, which is not a teleportation because you need to transmit in a conventional way to your measurement results, but because of this because we don't have.
8047000	8057000	So this has been done, but only over short distances, because, because a particle, the many particles can lose their quantum state in a millisecond.
8057000	8074000	So, so you need, well, at the speed of light, you can travel quite far in a millisecond. So that's the 300 kilo, 300 kilometers, right. And so therefore, yes, it's 300 kilometers in a millisecond, and therefore, I think the longest experiment is 200 kilometers that has been performed.
8074000	8087000	So within 200 kilometers of this travel distance, the particle did not lose yet its quantum property that you wanted to use for this for this to quantum teleportate. But so you would have to have so if you think of the United States.
8087000	8097000	Now maybe we can build a quantum system that that the best systems I think lose the quantum entanglement property in a millisecond so maybe you can build with half a millisecond.
8097000	8107000	And if you send 600 instead of 300 kilometers now then you would have to have a repeater every 500 kilometers. So that would be 12 repeaters across the United States.
8107000	8111000	Just to communicate within the United States in Germany it's a bit easier.
8111000	8118000	Because you just need to repeat it, but you need at least one in Luxembourg it works really well.
8119000	8134000	But they are not the world powers, you know, who look for quantum quantum communication. So now in Luxembourg you could already one dean's stellar could already inform the other one about a secret today was for the teleportation.
8134000	8141000	Russia would have from bloody North talk to Moscow it's I think it's 10,000 kilometers so you need 20 quantum repeat.
8141000	8146000	So, so this is why it doesn't work so you had another question.
8146000	8153000	So but but this is this is basically this entanglement.
8153000	8162000	I have much more I have a full set of slides explaining the whole series of graces but this is not the right moment to show it.
8162000	8172000	So this book, if you're interested in this. It's called consistent quantum theory appeared in 2002 in Cambridge it's summarized is there are three authors who have on this.
8172000	8184000	This is the third one we've written book about consistent quantum theory. All of them have the same trick that they basically trick with the commute commuting operators.
8184000	8192000	But but I think Griffith book is the one that presented in the best really the best way so, but you need quite a lot of mathematical knowledge but it's a great book.
8192000	8206000	Anyhow, so let's. So what is a qubit so quantum computers they don't use bits but two bits, and here you have a qubit symbolized in a very primitive way as a two basic states of some physical system.
8206000	8214000	And so, so quantum computers can speed up some computational problems but
8214000	8218000	what's that.
8218000	8226000	But in practice this has has not shown has not really been shown so in practice, it has been shown the qubit has been built.
8226000	8241000	And also logical qubit have been built which are, which are several physical qubits that make up one, one real qubit, one logical qubit to do error correction this is but but no, nobody has yet calculated anything useful the quantum computer.
8241000	8251000	And for example, the three transformation which is what the quantum computers would be much better at than classic computers, because we don't have quantum computers of the sufficient size.
8251000	8261000	Now, what are two with their systems with two base states and many superposition states and an example of such a system is the spin vector of an electron or two energy levels of an atom.
8261000	8269000	And so, now the base states are always more like this the vector for for zero is is a vector of one and zero and the vector for one is just the opposite.
8269000	8274000	Right so this is how you model in a two dimensional space, you do your base vectors.
8274000	8287000	Now, this, this doesn't come across right on this on the slide, because of the projector maybe I could change it but I'm afraid that then I will kind of lose.
8287000	8299000	Then I will lose the completely lose because that looks like an over but it's really a sphere, perfect sphere, and on this perfect sphere now you have here you have to stay zero at the state one.
8299000	8305000	Sorry, step one and say zero, and there was a science here.
8306000	8315000	No, but suddenly the Google is out of sync.
8315000	8329000	I can stop it and restart it.
8329000	8333000	Okay, maybe I'm offline.
8333000	8338000	No, because I can see your face.
8338000	8347000	Let me stop stop presentation and represent presentation.
8347000	8360000	So, okay, so here you see, you see the sphere, and that's tie is one state of the qubit.
8360000	8379000	And this is expressed can be expressed as alpha times zero plus better times one that's a linear combination that expresses arbitrary qubit state and as you pointed out, they are infinitely many, infinitely many of them, because a and B are complex numbers and the only restriction is that they need to be there.
8379000	8382000	There's something to be one wise that's the case because it's a sphere.
8382000	8384000	So this is just Pythagoras.
8384000	8409000	And so that, but basically, because we have Pythagoras here, we can also express a and B in terms of the sign and the core sign, which works like this. This is the Euler theorem you don't, you can look it up but it's Euler's equation applied to this and now you don't have alpha and beta as complex number as anymore.
8409000	8425000	But you now have Euler coordinates defined by the angle. So this angle which, which is used to to operate on the zero state vector is tether.
8425000	8437000	And the one for the, the other is five. And so you see here, you now combine tether and five to define the position of side.
8437000	8449000	And we are to the two basic dimensions. And because this factor is not observable in qubits, we can drop it or set it to one and then we obtain this.
8449000	8456000	So and they are because they are infinite number of qubit states so therefore quantum computers manipulate continuous magnitudes.
8456000	8465000	They basically manipulate quantum mechanical waves in infinite habit space, while classical computers manipulate discrete bits.
8465000	8476000	And this is the fundamental reason why quantum computers have the potential to be much faster than than classic computers. However, it's much harder to manipulate the continuous magnitude than a classical discrete bit, which can only take
8476000	8484000	0 and 1. This is super important to understand. Are there questions to this?
8484000	8495000	What is it that is being manipulated? Is it the angle that is being manipulated so that you get, because that would just correspond to the bridge.
8495000	8518000	So what is being made. So when you create a quantum, when you have a quantum computer with one bit of only one bit, and initialize it to try to set the state to zero.
8518000	8526000	And if you have eight bits as well, you said all the charges. Sorry, it was too loud. You tried to set all the states to zero.
8526000	8537000	Now, when you have, when you now initialize this, you have, you can imagine that you have a superposition of all the qubits of the quantum computer into one big wave.
8537000	8548000	So you, so we do not have a wave equation for, for each thing, but you now have a superposition across the two excellent eight bits.
8548000	8560000	Okay. And also that's in this kind of eight bits 256 continuous variables, contributing all to the way, but you don't know the shape of the way.
8560000	8572000	You just know that you have a quantum mechanical superposition in the, in this eight bit register and now you will start manipulating it by applying energy for example, to single bits.
8572000	8582000	By doing this, you are changing the shape of the entire curve of the entire quantum mechanical wave until at the end of the manipulations you make a measurement.
8582000	8588000	That's, that's how you manipulate. So you're basically manipulating the whole register with the quantum game.
8588000	8598000	So let's, let's, and so this is what I mean was manipulated. So, but before I can explain that I first have to explain a quantum measurement.
8598000	8608000	So, so quantum measurements are described by a collection of measurement operators. These are operators, which act on the state space of the system that is measured.
8608000	8621000	You measure this, this year, you actually assign it either a one or a zero, you can't measure these angles.
8621000	8633000	And that's not again the discretization of quantum mechanics that we are asking for although Barry, you have an infinite number of positions on the two lines of the two rays zero and one.
8633000	8652000	And when you measure it, you can only get one value zero or one. So now we have again the quantization phenomenon, right. And, and, and so the index M here refers to the measurement outcome that is my current experiment.
8652000	8657000	So the quantum experiment is just zero and one in quantum computing.
8657000	8674000	The quantum systems play immediately both the measurement and the probability that result and occurs is the following. So you, you have sign bra cat side and then you have this operator in the middle that you have to multiply and you have to.
8674000	8680000	This means complicated integration operation but at the end you get a certain probability.
8680000	8697000	So you've done this measurement you get this measurement operator times C divided by the by this, which is, which is just a normalizing factor to express that you have now, basically, that this is normalized between zero and one.
8697000	8711000	So the, the measurement operator satisfies the completeness equation. So that means if you if you have two of them and you multiply these two operators, this is the inverted transposed.
8711000	8727000	So this is a complement matrix, then you get the identity matrix. And so the most important measurement we have is the measurement of a qubit in the computation basis. So, this is the measurement of a single qubit with two outcomes and zero and M one.
8727000	8735000	And now, now you basically get basically get zero or one if you apply this measurement to the system team.
8735000	8748000	Right. And, and, and usually this factor here is not taken into account, but you only want to know the zero and one. So, so this is this is what you what you measure.
8748000	8758000	And of course, so this is the state that we had before and now you want to see whether it's one or zero and then you do this kind of measurement.
8758000	8774000	And now comes back to a question. So quantum computer performs calculations by manipulating qubits within a quantum register. So quantum register is a set of several qubits that are changed together in one quantum register.
8774000	8786000	So quantum computer performs calculations by manipulating qubits within a quantum register. The state of a quantum register is the two exponent n dimensional here but space a tensor product of the state space of the single qubit.
8786000	8796000	So, so here you have the single qubits. And they are, and the tensor product of the vectors gives the quantum space here you see what a tensor product is.
8796000	8810000	So if you have this vector and this vector the tensor product gives a matrix of size n times n. So it's this times this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and so on until you fill the whole matrix.
8810000	8819000	That's a tensor product, which gives you your new state space. And you, you have to be aware that each of those is already infinite.
8819000	8840000	Because this each qubit has a, has a, it's a complex vector space as is indicated by the sea, and has, and has, has infinitely many values. And out of this you make this, this, this big Hilbert space that gets more and more complicated as you're adding more qubits.
8840000	8849000	You have just 1000 qubits you have now the 10 x 1000 dimensional Hilbert space.
8849000	8860000	But which has infinite, but each of the dimension of the silvered space is, is continuous and not discrete, whereas in a quantum in a classical computer they are all discrete.
8860000	8881000	And this is the space on which the computation happens. And so, so let's look at a very simple base of this vector space. That is of course the base one and zero, and the register of two qubits and this basis, 00, 01, 1011.
8881000	8895000	The state of the register is now a superposition of the base set of this form. So what you have now is, so you have now two base, sorry, two bits.
8895000	8916000	And so this is bit one and bit two. But now you can multiply the first bit. So 01 and zero. So this is 01, this is 00, this is 02, 00 and 01. And now you can multiply them.
8916000	8935000	You have to multiply them with, with, with a complex, complex number for each of the basic states. So this is the basic state is complex, is multiplied with one complex number. The next base state with another complex number and the next and the next, so that you now have the sum of the four base states, each
8935000	8945000	one with one different complex number. And that gives this, this is very important equation, because it shows you that the classical computer would only have the four base states.
8945000	8956000	But here, you have to multiply each of the four with a complex number indicating where they are on the right. And so the superposition that you obtain by the four qubit is really this.
8956000	8972000	So this is, by the way, uppercase C to indicate that we are not talking about one qubit, but about a register. And now, as you see, we have now infinitely, even in the four qubit, you have four times infinitely many values that together form this complicated way.
8972000	8986000	And now this is the wave equation, so to speak, of your, of your, of your base states and why is it a wave equation because, because this cat here that you see here is equivalent to the, to the Schrodinger equation.
8986000	8999000	So the Schrodinger equation is like a superposition of four different Schrodinger equations, each made up of two qubit states, and each with its own complex number parameter multiplying.
8999000	9007000	And I think that when mathematicians work with quantum computer theory, they often forget how brittle this is.
9007000	9017000	It's more like the email we saw yesterday. It basically shows that the mathematician we're talking to. In this case, he was even visited but he forgot it.
9017000	9033000	He forgot to see that these are not just the four states. When you measure them, it's only the four states. But when you are calculating with some at runtime before you make the measurement you have an infinite amount of complexity you have to use even in the fall, even if you have just two qubits.
9033000	9050000	And this gets worse and worse, the more qubits you're adding because the number of qubit is in the exponent. So it's an exponential growth in complexity. And with with 1000 qubits. So the 1000 qubits by the way is the minimal amount of qubits that you need to have a practically useful quantum computer.
9050000	9063000	And you think of an RSA. So the RSA, you know, HGTPS, you know this, right? For the internet for encryption, when you pay with your credit card, the number of the credit card is encrypted.
9063000	9074000	And how does this work? The browser obtained a public key from an authority that provides public keys for the security and everybody has a public key.
9075000	9079000	Now the browser.
9079000	9082000	Let me signal the browser actually.
9082000	9091000	Yes, and then there's a private key known only by the authority that is now also known to the credit card company.
9091000	9106000	And now when you send your encrypted, now when you encrypt your transmission, you need both the private and the public key to be encrypted.
9106000	9123000	With quantum computing, you could decrypted quickly was a quantum computer was no without knowing the private key by by factorization of by prime number factorization, which is a quantum computer and minimal algorithm.
9123000	9127000	You could track it without knowing the public private key very quickly.
9127000	9143000	You need at least a thousand two bits or maybe many more cubits, but then you need to manage two excellent thousands cubits, so more cubits than these are more states, then we have particles in the observable universe.
9143000	9155000	So if we take our strongest telescope telescope and all this our galaxy and all the other thousands of galaxies that you can see with our strongest telescope and count how many particles these are, these are less than two excellent
9156000	9170000	So, so, so two excellent thousands a big number and that's a number we're facing for quantum computers that have the use for register so they need a register for 1000 digits, and we will see a bit later why that's the case but they need big register.
9170000	9175000	So, so this is this equation is extremely important.
9175000	9177000	Yes, question.
9177000	9182000	If I understand correctly, what then the point is because
9182000	9185000	Okay, just one.
9185000	9194000	One cubits. If you measure the state of the cubit, you will get a zero one or zero. So basically, no northern hemisphere so yes, all this.
9194000	9198000	Before you measure it, the state is actually on any of the infinite.
9198000	9201000	Yes, yes, yes.
9201000	9211000	You have just one cubit it's kind of useless because anytime it's only always going to be one or two. But when you link to two weeks together you don't have to
9211000	9221000	basically it can do a computation with any of the infinite values that it has and only after it's done the computation you can measure the result again and comprise it.
9221000	9235000	And the trick that you are doing and we understand this much better for us that you are using the cubits to perform us in a certain style of calculation using quantum gates, we will see how these words tomorrow.
9235000	9244000	And then, and you only have to measure out of the many two bits in your register one single one to get all the information you need to solve your problem.
9244000	9257000	It's so hard so you need to set up. It's very, you need a lot of cleverness you need to set up a mathematical algorithm that allows you to be to be expressed in this amplitude of the of a cubit register.
9257000	9272000	But at the end can be obtained the critical result but can be obtained with one measurement. And tomorrow we will. There's one very simple algorithm, the Deutsche algorithm which was the first quantum algorithm with which works with with one or two cubits.
9272000	9282000	We will see tomorrow I forgot it but we will see tomorrow, which which which explains in the principle from which you can understand why it's that such a beautiful speed up.
9282000	9290000	But this we will look at tomorrow, and then you then you will understand how it works in the same way you understand today, how the logic gates work.
9290000	9303000	The key is always to to to to make implicit usage of the complexity that this allows, and then, who nevertheless get all the results you need from one or very few measurements.
9303000	9311000	And this is this is the trick of quantum computing. And of course, he's not only uses superposition but also entanglement.
9311000	9318000	Entanglement is super important.
9318000	9330000	For quantum computing so this is the two registers, two bits, a two cubit register was zero one one zero, right, and now an entanglement state business very this is the same way in entanglement then we saw as a photon.
9330000	9335000	So that we see that it's a mixture of zero one one zero.
9335000	9341000	And this state cannot be affected into a product of the state of the first and second bit.
9341000	9352000	This is quantum entanglement and the main foundation for the high efficiency of quantum computing for some problems. So, so not only is the way superposition for men for several cubits important, but also the entanglement.
9352000	9369000	And here it says, you can't factor it into a product of the state of the first and second bit that that means what I said before, that the projectors are non commuting, because we cannot factor this, this sum into product of the first and second bit.
9369000	9379000	So this is like the photo entanglement, and these entanglement states are critical are critical for quantum computing, and they give the quantum computers that power.
9379000	9386000	entanglement is a phenomenon that is not it's in the classical world.
9386000	9391000	How can you maintain a computer computation.
9391000	9395000	If you have this kind of entanglement just between two.
9395000	9404000	So basically, you are, you are, you as we will see in the dodge algorithm, you are making usage of the entanglement for elegant computations.
9404000	9410000	The problem is, and you was elegant computations that save that save you.
9410000	9424000	So you are utilizing the entanglement to save computation steps, because such an entanglement in the dodge algorithm, you can do one computation set instead of two, because basically we're operating on the entangled state.
9425000	9435000	And then when you do the true algorithm, which is, which is quantum free transformation, then you can, then, then it becomes more and more and more efficient.
9435000	9448000	And so this is what we're going to look at tomorrow, but the entanglement basically allows you, because, because when you, when you create one bit, the other bit gets also automatically entangled, and each computation is a register management.
9449000	9455000	Right. So when you hear the test, you're sending electrons through the gates, and that creates new form of electrons.
9455000	9459000	And this is how you manipulate this. This was called a circle.
9459000	9475000	Right. And at the end, you read out a register that is connected to your circuit to get your, for example, the additional result here, it's different here you are not the quantum circuit consists of a series of manipulation of a register.
9475000	9482000	And at each, each, and each time you manipulate your register, I mean, manipulate all the tools at the same time.
9482000	9500000	And, and, and, and that's that's what is what that's if you find an algorithm where this creates less computations that then you have the advantages of the quantum computer and and George was the not a German by the way I think it was an Englishman was the first
9500000	9513000	in the early nineties to figure out such an algorithm. And then, then in the, in the early 2000s, it was, it was implemented for the first time. And I think that's a paper that I was sent yesterday as answer to my question.
9516000	9524000	So, so quantum gate is a manipulation of a quantum register.
9525000	9545000	So, for example, if you have as a quantum, a qubit, the state of an atom, the energy level of an atom, and you know, you have the electrons on the lower on the lower energy levels of the atom, and you shoot with a laser against it will elevate the electrons to a high level.
9545000	9562000	And that's where you will, you will be able to change the state of, of the, of the, of the quantum bit. And this is, this is, and this is what a quantum operator does it changes the quantum register.
9562000	9575000	And the quantum gate is so if the quantum register is written as uppercut psi, the quantum register maps this psi to multiplication of, of the operator you with psi.
9575000	9583000	And so that's the quadratic matrix, which has exactly the same rows and numbers as the qubits of the computer.
9583000	9598000	So if the computer has two qubits, then the matrix is two times two magic with three qubit three times three and so on. And, and this creates, and these rows and comments are also normal with regard to scalar multiplication.
9598000	9606000	So, so, so that that's that's it's a quadratic matrix with this property.
9606000	9612000	And so that, that also means that you can always take it back.
9612000	9626000	Right, so every quantum operation is reversible because of the unitary nature of the matrix. That means, when you, when you, when you, you apply this to a, to a quantum register, which is a vector of zeros and ones.
9626000	9631000	So if you have a quadratic matrix to get a result, you can always calculate that.
9631000	9641000	So look here, for example, on the or, once you have the result that you have a zero or a one, the one can come from three different constellations of the input.
9641000	9644000	So it's not reverse seven you don't know anymore.
9644000	9650000	What was it. So, what was the input, and, and the quantum computer.
9650000	9655000	And the future operation on the quantum register as a unitary operator which is fully reversible.
9655000	9663000	And, and often normal with regard to mathematically speaking that means it's often almost regard to scalar multiplication.
9663000	9669000	And so, so the resulting product is still orthogonal.
9669000	9676000	And, and, and so that means that the resulting in the resulting matrix columns.
9676000	9688000	The columns are always sorry columns of the, of the matrix are orthogonal so and so linear independent and also normalized.
9688000	9698000	So, so this is a quantum gates a quantum opera to, to, to repeat it once more we are starting with one qubit.
9698000	9703000	There's impossibly many states but if you measure it we can get one base data.
9703000	9713000	Then we have, we have, we take several quantum bits together which we have the quantum register, which is like a vector of zero than one.
9713000	9722000	And this is an example. This is a two quantum big quantum register with four base states zero zero zero one one zero and one one.
9722000	9733000	And all the, and the, and the, and this state is like a big training a wave, which is, which is, which is linear combination of those base states.
9733000	9737000	And this is an entanglement of two base states.
9737000	9749000	And this is the quantum gate. So unlike here where we have a Julian table that presents what the, what the quantum gate does.
9749000	9754000	What the logical gate does the quantum gate is like a matrix multiplication.
9754000	9756000	Matrix multiplication.
9756000	9759000	So that's the matrix.
9759000	9761000	Yes.
9761000	9765000	But, but, but so at the technical level.
9765000	9773000	Yeah, it's not the component like a circuit but it's like a manipulation of the energy level of the, of one or several of the cubits.
9773000	9779000	And, and basically what it does it is, it is acting mathematically speaking like a matrix multiplication.
9779000	9781000	And so here's an example.
9781000	9784000	So, so this is a negation gate.
9784000	9792000	So it turns around the state of the of two cubits so if you multiply.
9792000	9804000	So this is a cubit which is in state one zero, you get out a cubit with a state, sorry, register which is states one and zero, you multiply this then you get out states, you went one.
9804000	9811000	Yeah, and so, and so.
9811000	9818000	So we have a superposition time on the basis of zero and one on the two cubit computer.
9818000	9826000	And now this means that they are linear combinations of alpha times zero plus beta times one.
9826000	9835000	And you know that zero is in matrix rotation zero is is this.
9835000	9838000	I think there was always this nice to look it up.
9838000	9844000	I'm very bad at remembering this was here at the beginning.
9844000	9848000	Yes.
9848000	9850000	So zero is this.
9850000	9854000	And one is this.
9854000	9858000	Now if you multiply.
9858000	9860000	If you multiply.
9860000	9862000	So they're linear combination.
9862000	9864000	Which is so near.
9864000	9869000	So if you have alpha times this.
9869000	9873000	Am I getting this right. Yes, plus beta times this.
9873000	9878000	So I'm going to get rid of all of this.
9878000	9881000	That's better times this.
9881000	9887000	Then this is alpha and zero and bet and zero and better so this alpha beta.
9887000	9897000	So this is the representation of an arbitrary parametrization of your group it register with two complex numbers.
9897000	9905000	Now, you can take this and multiply this alpha better times this gate.
9905000	9912000	Zero one, sorry, it needs to be written down the other way, zero one one zero times alpha better.
9913000	9920000	Zero times alpha plus one times better is better.
9920000	9923000	And then the other one is formed.
9923000	9927000	One times alpha plus zero times better is.
9927000	9932000	So with with simply made sorry it's a bit covered but I don't have. So I put it back here.
9932000	9937000	Zero one one zero multiplied by alpha better.
9937000	9941000	Equals better.
9941000	9944000	So because because of my reputation right.
9944000	9951000	And so so this this this military operator does changes the order of the two qubits.
9951000	9957000	And so this is super important so if you think of quantum computation.
9957000	9966000	You have this register, and then you have just many, many such military mass which is more like a pack with a register, until you get a certain result of your register.
9966000	9971000	And then you may have one of the two qubits, and that gives you the result of your entire competition.
9971000	9979000	The whole computation is just a long life application series of the register with different markets is which represent the quantum games.
9979000	9982000	That's it. That's what this might have mathematically.
9982000	9991000	And, and so so this is like comes from that this position to turn by saying zero times alpha plus one times better.
9991000	9998000	This position is given by one times alpha plus zero times better. That's that's just linear.
9998000	10006000	And now you can imagine that you have a bigger register now we have big math it says, and they all get multiplied. And after that you get a final result.
10006000	10010000	And, and now comes interesting question.
10010000	10016000	So, so from this you see that every quantum computer is just a series of matrix.
10016000	10027000	So therefore every quantum computer can be simulated by classical computer, because of course the classical computer can also execute but whatever it's not so.
10027000	10036000	So, so, so it, and, and it's, there are cases where the quantum computer needs and steps.
10036000	10044000	And the quantum computer, the classical computer needs n sets of quantum computer needs square root of n steps.
10044000	10054000	For example, if it would need 100 steps, then the quantum computer would need, would need 10, and if it would need 10,000 steps, the quantum computer would just need 100.
10054000	10056000	This looks pretty good.
10056000	10064000	Right. The problem is that the quantum computer needs many, many, many more bits than the classical computer to achieve this.
10064000	10083000	So many more bits that the only computations, the only speed up that is useful to help with the computer computer is this, which is called so this is called for the normal speed up and this is an exponential speed up where you have basically this.
10083000	10097000	So, so if you have, for example, here to exponent 10 computations, we think eight is 156, nine is 512 so that's 1024.
10097000	10100000	Here you would only have 10.
10100000	10110000	This is 100 times speed up. But if you have, let's say, to exponent 12.
10110000	10117000	That's 4096 computations was a quantum computer you would get down to 12.
10117000	10124000	You see, that's amazing, right. So here you need 12 computations you need 4000 computations.
10124000	10135000	That's an exponential speed up. Right now think of, I mean, it gets worse if you think of you need on the classical computer 20 to exponent 100 computations.
10135000	10141000	That's as many particles as we have in the in the middle way.
10141000	10150000	Right. So it's a huge set of particles. And now if you do the quantum computer you just have other computations or two to experiment, you just have other computation.
10151000	10160000	And this is what you basically need for if you want to crack encryption with a quantum computer, you apply the algorithm that achieves a speed up.
10160000	10169000	And now you see the difference so 100 computations that that can be done, you know, one clock cycle of a quantum computer is is a tense of a millisecond.
10169000	10172000	So then you can do this in less than a second.
10172000	10186000	You can do a quantum computer where as you would need to to the exponent 100 can be taken on a regular computer, which takes years, or I don't know thousands of years so so so this show you that an exponential speed up is very very effective.
10186000	10200000	But even what you see here you understand now that each quantum computer can be can be can be simulated with a with a with a normal computer because it's in the end just a series of matrix modifications.
10200000	10206000	So today this was more than enough. I'm afraid.
10206000	10210000	And, and I buried do you
