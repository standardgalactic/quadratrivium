0	8300	I'm going to start by explaining something about what ontology is and what it means to
8300	10040	apply ontology.
10040	16740	So I guess everyone knows that ontology is an old sub-discipline of philosophy.
16740	20500	So Aristotle already was doing ontology.
20500	24740	Ontology now is also a branch of computer science.
24740	30820	So when we do digital humanities, then we are confronted very often with images like
30820	36680	this with hairballs representing data that we have about many different things, many
36680	39340	different subjects, many different people and so on.
39340	46680	So this is a hairball representing data about people who are prominent in the digital humanities
46680	49500	who engage on Twitter.
49500	52380	It has no relevance at all to what I say next.
52380	57460	But it's an example of the sort of data that we have, which could in principle be used
57460	59300	for research.
59300	63820	This is an example of political data that we have.
63820	70620	This is an example of how different journals make themselves felt, different humanities
70620	75660	and social science journals make themselves felt in Twitter again.
75660	80880	So there's lots of data like this and we could in principle use this data for interesting
80880	83160	research purposes.
83160	89440	And I just mentioned that data like this is being used all the time by people in biology
89440	93960	and medicine and similar subjects using ontologies.
93960	99120	So what can they do, which could also be done with data like this?
99120	103240	That's the question or the challenge that I'm going to address.
103240	112680	Now one way of addressing this challenge is to create what are called linked open data.
112680	119080	And the idea here is that if you have data about a specific subject, then that will be
119080	122520	described using certain terms.
122520	128840	And if you can organize these terms into a representation of the data, then you can link
128840	133040	it to other such organized representations of data.
133040	139040	In such a way that you can then reason across the data, you can draw conclusions from it.
139040	144560	And these are the areas which form this linked open data cloud.
144560	150960	This is basically a happy hunting ground for hackers who like to join data from different
150960	151960	areas.
151960	157120	So they use the linked open data cloud as a key to combining data.
157120	159760	And you can see there's too much of it.
159760	166840	It's very unlikely that you're going to create useful connections between data, which you
166840	171560	can use for research, unless you're a hacker.
171560	174720	So there's no way this can be done easily.
174720	177200	So you can read this.
177200	178200	You couldn't read.
178200	181200	This is a very early version of the linked open data cloud.
181200	186560	Now many of these modules within the linked open data cloud are ontologies.
186560	190920	So there's one up in the right hand corner called ontoworld.
190920	196000	I have no idea what that is, but it's an example of this kind of thing that you find in the
196000	198260	linked open data cloud.
198260	202760	This is an illustration of the freedom of the internet.
202760	208040	Anybody can add a new ontology or a new module to the linked open data cloud.
208040	213040	So I think the stuff on the left includes music ontologies, for instance.
213040	215840	I don't like that because it only works for hackers.
215840	221200	It only works for people who are willing to spend their days and their nights trying to
221200	228160	glue together very, very large numbers of data representations in useful ways.
228160	234240	If you're a hacker and if you know a lot about specific kinds of data, you can get real value
234240	241640	from the linked open data and from data, PDA and similar storehouses of data.
241640	248600	But I'm not a hacker and I'm assuming that not everyone on the call is a hacker and certainly
248600	255680	none of us is an expert on many of the areas of data that they might want to relate to.
255680	258960	That's the interestingness of new research.
258960	263720	You can try to engage with data in areas where you are not an expert.
263720	267000	You can't do that with the linked open data method.
267320	272920	The ontology method is more general than linked open data.
272920	280400	You can think of an ontology as a computable lexicon, sometimes called a controlled vocabulary.
280400	287000	The lexicon represents the types of entities in a given domain where you have data.
287000	295920	The idea is that if people use controlled vocabularies that are public, consensus-based lexical resources,
295920	301720	then everybody will be able to find the data they need rather easily because they can look
301720	306760	in the catalogs of the controlled vocabularies and they can see where all the data about
306760	315480	viruses might be found or where all the data about Thai politics or Japanese cooking or
315480	316800	whatever it might be.
316800	321240	If you have controlled vocabularies for each of these areas, then this makes combining
321240	325440	data more easy.
325840	330720	Ontology is a method for creating controlled vocabularies of this sort, which are useful
330720	338880	both to humans and to people, and to humans and to computers.
338880	340400	That's what an ontology is.
340400	347240	It happens that UB is probably the world centre of ontology, at least measured by our impacts
347240	350400	and by the number of ontologies which are maintained here.
350400	355360	The grant funding that we've been receiving over the years, the number of faculties where
355360	359240	we have ontologists working, and so forth.
359240	366680	But the origins of ontology go back to the 1980s, and you see the name Tom Gruber here.
366680	375720	He is the most famous person in the early stages of ontology, and he's interesting today
375720	385240	because he is the inventor of the Siri app in your iPhone, which is based on ontologies.
385280	390080	Siri contains ontologies of restaurants, of movies.
390080	393440	This is what an ontology inside Siri looks like.
393440	401120	You have the names of the general types that you want to capture, types like city or state
401120	406760	or zip code, and then you have instances of those types, which are the particular cities
406760	411480	or states or zip codes where you might find restaurants or movies or whatever it might
411480	412480	be.
412480	416400	So this is a characteristic split in ontology land.
416400	422800	You have ontologies which are about universals, about general types, and then you have particulars
422800	425880	which are the instances of those general types.
425880	431720	And the Siri app is constantly growing with more and more data about restaurants and movies
431720	439640	and so forth, so that you can work out where you want to eat before you go to a movie tonight.
439640	443600	And what we're doing in biology is very similar.
443600	452360	So in biology, we have types like virus or coronavirus or SARS virus or COVID-19 virus.
452360	457400	These are all types, and then we have many, many instances in all the people who have
457400	460440	the corresponding diseases.
460440	464000	So there are journals devoted to ontology now.
464000	469720	One of these journals existed before the turn of the century.
469720	476360	There is a journal of biomedical semantics, which is about ontology of biomedicine.
476360	484480	Now in around the year 2000, with the conclusion of the human genome project, ontologies became
484480	492800	really important in biology and in medicine because the genomic data which was being discovered
492800	497320	is just huge sequences of chemical letters, letters of the alphabet.
497320	504960	It doesn't have any connection to the biological and medical things which are important, like
504960	513120	viruses or diseases or lungs or cell division or any of these other things which belong
513120	514720	to the old biology.
514720	521720	And the gene ontology, which is by far the most successful ontology in any domain, is
521720	530440	an ontology of old biology which was used systematically to tag sequences, gene sequences,
530440	537040	protein sequences, other kinds of sequences, and it thereby made sequence data usable to
537040	541200	people who wanted to do old biology or old medicine.
541200	545320	In other words, they wanted to study things like diseases.
545320	552080	Now so this is the paper in which the gene ontology was presented to the world.
552080	560200	It's been cited some 30,000 times, very influential, and the idea then led to copies.
560200	567160	People wanted to have ontologies for other parts of biology and for other areas.
567160	576720	So the people around the gene ontology who built these ontologies created an initiative
576720	582280	called the oboe foundry, the open biological and biomedical ontologies foundry.
582280	586120	I was one of the founders of this foundry.
586120	592160	They wanted originally to call it the smithy, but I vetoed that suggestion.
592160	596920	And you can see that the first ontology in the list of oboe foundry ontologies is called
596920	598840	basic formal ontology.
598840	604040	This is the top level ontology which joins all the other ontologies together within the
604040	606080	oboe foundry as a whole.
606080	609160	That ontology was more or less my creation.
609160	613120	That was 20 years ago.
613120	618240	And then this is a paper in which we capture the methodology for building consistent ontologies
618240	621000	across the whole domain of biomedicine.
621000	623680	This is in 2007.
623680	629360	Already in that year, the oboe foundry was beginning to show its successes in many areas
629360	631840	of biology and is still doing so.
631840	633080	All right.
633080	637360	So one way in which these ontologies are used is to tag literature.
637360	646200	So the colors here represent tags between phrases in a text and ontologies which have
646200	649160	been created for the domains treated in the text.
649160	656000	This is a bit like tagging sequence data, but now you're tagging textual data.
656000	661000	And so that you can see it more clearly now when I've made the type bigger.
661000	668840	So the infection in the top right which is red is tagged red because it's tagged by
668840	675400	a term from the disease ontology which is indicated in the list of tabs at the top.
675400	676400	All right.
676400	678800	So now we tag sequence data.
678800	680760	We tag other kinds of data.
680760	682040	We tag clinical notes.
682040	687080	We tag literature in the abstract databases and so on.
687080	692240	And thereby we bring together, we create a network out of all of these different kinds
692240	696240	of data using ontology.
696240	702480	And this is just one of many different kinds of portals which enable you to search through
702480	706480	these data source using ontology and to reason over them in different ways.
706480	709920	I'm not going to go into any detail.
709920	716800	This works in biology, works in science generally because scientists have an incentive to use
716800	721760	the same general terms in all the work that they do.
721760	725800	Nobody wants to have multiple terms through the same thing in science.
725800	728880	That is not the way science works.
728880	737320	And the success of modern biology was achieved in large part through the use of common terms
737320	744760	to represent chemical symbols, DNA sequences and so forth.
744760	749680	But in the humanities, things are not like that.
749680	756320	There isn't much greater independence and creativity in terminological usage in the humanities.
756720	761600	In many cases, terms are not logically defined and there is no interest in logical definitions
761600	766760	because that's not what the humanities are primarily interested in.
766760	773080	Humanities, researchers are not doing science in the way that biologists, for instance, are
773080	774080	doing science.
774080	780200	And also there's a lack of ways of testing whether one or other interpretation of a text
780200	781200	is correct.
781200	784480	It could be that multiple interpretations are correct.
784480	788840	But new interpretations are important precisely because they're new.
788840	794160	They throw a new light on what was a text that people thought could be understood in
794160	799640	old ways so that there's a completely different attitude in the humanities.
799640	801640	Now I mentioned basic formal ontology.
801640	804000	This is just a fragment of it.
804000	807760	It has altogether 35 nodes.
807760	812440	These are just a few examples of nodes and the content doesn't matter.
812440	815800	I'm just illustrating the way the system works.
815800	821160	One interesting feature of BFO is that it's now an international standard.
821160	828240	So this is the first piece of philosophy that is useful enough to deserve being made into
828240	829720	an international standard.
829720	834400	This took three years of my life to get to the point where it's now been approved as
834400	836400	an international standard.
836400	840680	And that means that in the sciences, but also now in government and administration and
840680	846320	such circles, people use BFO and they have confidence that it's been validated by a very
846320	848880	strict process.
848880	850120	So this is BFO.
850120	852560	Now why is BFO important?
852560	854920	Because we can extend it.
854920	860800	So this is an extension of BFO into the realm of mental functioning, things like thinking,
860800	862680	planning, learning, and so forth.
862680	867760	And then we can extend that further to include emotions.
867760	871600	So this is a fragment of the emotion ontology.
871600	874600	And you see that we have behavioral processes.
874600	876680	We have subjective feelings.
876680	878440	We have action tendencies.
878440	884160	These are all parts of standard ways of viewing emotions.
884160	891520	And what the emotion ontology gives you is a control of vocabulary or describing emotions.
891520	896800	And so you can use this control of vocabulary to tag data coming from different sources,
896800	903400	which may be from psychology, but it may also be from literature or history, or it may also
903400	906240	be from studying texts, for instance.
906240	915280	So this is a consensus-based control of vocabulary for tagging all kinds of data, all kinds of
915280	919680	texts and so on about emotions.
919680	921640	And so this is what it looks like.
921640	927000	So emotion is based on some sort of appraisal.
927000	930760	An appraisal is a kind of cognitive representation.
930760	935800	And there are different kinds of appraisals which are shown around the circle here.
935800	941120	So there is an appraisal of social attention, appraisal of loss, appraisal of avoidability,
941120	942760	and so forth.
942760	946800	Depending on the appraisal, we have a different kind of emotion.
946800	951800	Sometimes we have emotions spontaneously, and we don't cognitively come to any awareness
951800	952800	of the appraisal.
952800	958600	But there's an appraisal going on somehow, even if not in this particular moment.
958600	965960	And then we have types of physiological response to emotion.
965960	969080	So our muscles relax, our muscles become tense.
969080	974160	We breathe at a slower rate, we breathe at a more rapid rate, and so on.
975040	979720	So the emotional ontology contains all terms for all of these different kinds of physiological
979720	980720	response.
980720	985360	And then we have different kinds of feelings, feeling nervous, feeling bad, feeling tired,
985360	987080	feeling strong, and so on.
987080	993880	These are documented in the emotional ontology in a consensus-based, consistent way.
993880	998480	Moreover, for all of these terms, and for all the terms in all of the ontology, we
998480	1003640	have human definitions, so natural language definitions, so that human beings can understand
1003640	1005360	what the terms mean.
1005360	1012600	But we also have logical definitions, so that computers can use these terms as a basis for
1012600	1014400	computational reasoning.
1014400	1021120	All right, now, we can now put different ontologies together.
1021120	1025360	So there is a chemistry ontology called kebi.
1025360	1033120	And emotions, as people who like drinking alcohol know, are closely related to chemistry.
1034120	1039240	And so using ontologies, we can build maps of what these relations are.
1039240	1043440	So happiness, for instance, is an emotion.
1043440	1050440	And happiness is, in fact, part of a certain kind of neurotransmitter receptor activity,
1050440	1053080	which is a gene ontology term.
1053080	1061440	And this neurotransmitter receptor activity is realized, sorry, it has as its realizer
1061440	1067080	a certain neurotransmitter, which is called dopamine.
1067080	1072880	So that is linking three ontologies together in order to give an account of what happiness
1072880	1073880	is.
1073880	1077040	And whether this is correct or incorrect, it's not so important.
1077040	1081960	What is important is to see how ontologies can enable you to link data of quite different
1081960	1086480	sorts in a consistent way.
1086480	1088960	And this is another story about sadness.
1088960	1094920	I don't think I will go into this, but you get the idea.
1094920	1101000	Depression is realized in a certain kind of sadness, which has as part the down-regulation
1101000	1103080	of the dopaminergic system.
1103080	1109600	All right, now we can apply this, for instance, to sentiment profiles for religious texts.
1109600	1116400	We have a canonical vocabulary for describing emotions or sentiments.
1116400	1122720	And we can use this vocabulary to map certain features of, for instance, religious texts.
1122720	1126840	So here the Koran is in pink and the Bible is in blue.
1126840	1132240	And you can see that in these areas, they're pretty much the same.
1132240	1139200	But so, for instance, joy and anger are very highly expressed in both the Bible and in
1139200	1140720	the Koran.
1140720	1143600	But here they disagree.
1143600	1153240	So the Koran emphasizes much more trust and fear and somewhat more fear and anxiety relative
1153240	1154720	to the Bible.
1154720	1159120	All right, so the emotional ontology lives on the web.
1159120	1163040	You can find it on the bio portal, which is a repository of ontologies.
1163040	1164880	There are other such repositories.
1164880	1170680	It's updated slowly by experts, such as me, for instance.
1170680	1176360	And it's tested in various different kinds of applications, for instance, applications
1176360	1179960	to understanding how people respond to lectures.
1179960	1186920	You can have them tick how they feel at certain times during the lecture using an app created
1186920	1189640	on the basis of the emotional ontology.
1189640	1197640	So now BFO is much more widely accepted now than it was when it first arose within the
1197640	1199920	oboe foundry research.
1199920	1207440	It's now used in some 350 ontology efforts, many of which are in biology and medicine,
1207440	1209520	but some of which are in other kinds of areas.
1209520	1213480	And I'll illustrate some of these in a minute.
1213480	1220040	So the interesting thing is that many of these ontologies are created or co-created or co-managed
1220040	1221040	here in Buffalo.
1221040	1224640	So this is just a few of those.
1224640	1227720	We have the collaborative behavior ontology.
1227720	1233680	We have a suite of common core ontologies, which are designed to cover a huge array of
1233680	1242640	areas such as nations, politics, law, government administration, and so on and so on.
1242640	1246840	Then as you can see, we have the coronavirus infectious disease ontology, which is part
1246840	1254600	of a whole suite of infectious disease ontologies, which is we've been building here with, in
1254600	1259720	fact, collaborators in other universities for some 10 years now.
1259720	1264160	We have a document act ontology, which is about, for instance, the ways in which we
1264160	1272760	use legal documents in order to perform certain acts, acts of signing or filling in or amending
1272760	1273760	and so forth.
1273760	1276640	And you've seen the emotional ontology.
1276640	1282080	We also have the environment ontology, and at the very bottom, you see the United Nations
1282080	1287040	Sustainable Development Goals ontology that is based in large part on the environment
1287040	1288040	ontology.
1288040	1293840	Then we have the information artifact ontology, which is a kind of ontologization of what
1293840	1301440	the Dublin core is trying to do with bibliographic and bibliometric terms.
1301440	1306200	And then we have some more disease ontologies, pain and so forth.
1306200	1311480	So there are people in, I think, four faculties that you'd be who are working on ontologies.
1311480	1316840	We have people in engineering, people in the dental school, people in the medical school,
1316840	1323800	people in the management school, and then we have people in College of Arts and Sciences.
1323800	1328880	Many of them are working directly with me or they're my students.
1328880	1333760	Some of them have come to Buffalo independently and then discovered ontology.
1333760	1339920	And I'm hoping that in the humanities, digital humanities field, we can find new opportunities
1339920	1342720	for collaborations of this sort.
1342720	1349560	All right, now there's also a book, which I wrote with two former students, which is
1349560	1353880	a guidebook to building, well, you can see what it's a guidebook for.
1353880	1359960	Now let's talk a little bit about what it means to have an international standard.
1359960	1366440	So the International Standards Organization and the International Electro-Technical Commission
1366480	1372120	have a joint technical committee, which was the committee which was responsible for the BFO standard.
1372120	1375360	And one of the things that they do is world plugs.
1375360	1381000	So if you travel, which some people used to do in the olden times, you need to carry plugs
1381000	1385840	and it's good to know that the plugs that you carry will fit.
1385840	1391400	And so the International Electro-Technical Commission ensures that there is a relatively
1391400	1397560	small number of options for plugs of any given type.
1397560	1406120	So these are the areas of the globe in which the different types of plugs are used.
1406120	1409400	And this is a better map.
1409400	1415000	So you see most of them use the same kind of plug, but not the United States nor the
1415000	1419360	United Kingdom, both of whom are outliers.
1419360	1424240	And the reason for the English-speaking world is an outlier.
1424240	1429600	These are the countries using plugs and sockets to type E.
1429600	1431320	And so it goes on like this.
1431320	1436800	Now the reason I'm telling you all of this is because that's what we do when we maintain
1436800	1439160	a library.
1439160	1445840	So Dublin Core and before that the Library of Congress had various different kinds of
1445840	1450160	information that they needed to fit with other kinds of information.
1450160	1454720	And gradually, as the computer became more important to the workings of a library, it
1454720	1460320	was necessary to make these various different types of information fit together.
1460320	1463160	And that's what the Dublin Core tries to do.
1463160	1467400	Now the Dublin Core is an example of an ontology.
1467400	1469800	It's a very widely used ontology.
1469800	1473560	It doesn't have all the qualities that an ontology can have.
1473560	1478680	So it can't support logical reasoning in the way that, for instance, the gene ontology
1478680	1480880	or the emotion ontology can.
1480880	1486920	But still, it's an ontology and it's an ontology which is standardized over many libraries and
1486920	1492320	helps to make sure the different kinds of information fit, but also that you can find
1492320	1497840	different kinds of information more easily because they've been standardized in their
1497840	1499840	typology.
1499840	1507080	All right, now I did something similar, again with actually the former collaborator, for
1507080	1513560	philosophy, so creating an ontology philosophy, viewing philosophy now in the old-fashioned
1513560	1518080	sense according to which philosophy is part of the humanities.
1518080	1521200	So what would such an ontology look like?
1521200	1526040	Well, first of all, we can look at the relations.
1526040	1532200	We've joined together the main kinds of entity, the main types in the philosophical field.
1532200	1538320	So we have philosophers who are persons, and then we have groups of philosophers, and then
1538320	1545800	we have the concepts which those philosophers engage with, and then we have fields, fields
1545800	1549000	and philosophical entities more generally.
1549000	1550640	And now there are relations between them.
1550640	1553440	So a person can be a member of a group.
1553440	1556520	One group can be a subgroup of another group.
1556520	1561600	A person or a group can work on a concept, and the person or a group can be active in
1561600	1563200	a field and so on.
1563200	1569320	So this is not rocket science, this is just trying to make things fit clearly so that
1569320	1574080	you can keep track of the data that you have in a consistent way.
1574080	1583280	So these are some examples of relations in the Philonto, so Kant is an instance of philosopher
1583280	1589480	and concept is a subcategory of philosophical entity and so on.
1589480	1593640	And then the bottom line here, disjoint concept proposition and so forth, that means that no
1593640	1598160	concept is a proposition, no proposition is a concept, no concept is a theory, no theory
1598160	1601480	is a concept and so on.
1601480	1606680	And then philosophy as a whole is the all-encompassing philosophical field.
1606680	1616640	So every philosophy is a part, sorry, every philosophical field is a part of the all-encompassing
1616640	1620680	philosophical field called philosophy.
1620680	1627760	Now you can't see all of this, but once we start building the ontology it gets very big.
1627760	1635120	So because we have all these subfields, and if you imagine a gigantic extended graph with
1635120	1640280	philosophy at the top, and then you have all of these various subfields below it.
1640280	1643240	So this is just the graph of the subfields of philosophy.
1643240	1652320	Then we have geographic areas because philosophers lived in certain areas at certain times and
1652320	1658920	in certain parts of the globe, and so we organized the ontology in such a way that we can capture
1658920	1666280	these kinds of information too, and that's a very, very simple part of the historical
1666280	1671560	period and geographical area treatments of the ontology.
1671560	1679160	And so we can say that Plato is a metaphysician who worked on these arguments here listed
1679160	1681040	down the right-hand side.
1681040	1685880	He was a realist about forms, he was an ancient Greek philosopher, and ancient Greeks philosophers
1685880	1692280	include, is part of both ancient philosophers and Greek philosophers.
1692280	1693640	So what can we do with this?
1693640	1698640	Well, we have a map of all philosophers, all philosophers who were listed.
1698640	1701480	I'll explain where this map comes from in a minute.
1701480	1707480	So if you imagine every dot on this map is a philosopher, the dots in the middle of the
1707480	1714640	little cycles here are the supervisors, the PhD supervisors of the people on the edges
1714640	1716280	of the ring.
1716280	1721960	So truly influential people have big rings of followers around them.
1721960	1729040	And every dot is a person who is an instance of the type philosopher.
1729040	1737400	And this is the same information now expressed as a list rather than as a big graph.
1737400	1740680	So this is the Leibniz lineage.
1740680	1745040	Peter Hare was the chair of the philosophy department here at BUB for many years.
1745040	1751080	And he is part of the Leibniz lineage in the sense that there is a line from Peter Hare
1751080	1755520	through his supervisor all the way back to Leibniz.
1755520	1760960	This is a bit of a cheat because Leibniz was not, in fact, the doctoral supervisor of Bernoulli.
1760960	1764560	They didn't really have the supervisor system in 1663.
1764560	1772160	But it's leaving aside that wrinkle, this is a picture of the doctor-father-student
1772160	1774240	relation.
1774240	1781280	This is the Menke lineage, which is less interesting, but it includes the immediate former chair
1781280	1786120	of BUB, namely David Hirshinoff.
1786120	1790880	And this is the Weiser lineage, which is also less interesting than the Leibniz lineage,
1790880	1796520	which includes me and so forth.
1796520	1803120	Now this is, all right, and now we have subtypes of philosopher.
1803120	1808520	And you can see how complicated this graph is going to get once we organize it carefully
1808520	1809520	and represent it.
1809520	1814000	But still, it's not difficult to do this kind of work.
1814000	1818760	There will be some overlaps, which will be difficult, but in general, we can get a lot
1818760	1826560	of the easy parts done very quickly, and then we can create relations like I illustrated
1826560	1827560	before.
1827560	1832040	Now the big graph that I showed you and the tablets form something called the philosophy
1832040	1840040	family tree, which describes itself as an academic genealogy of philosophers based on
1840040	1849440	this link of Dr. Supervisor, and they have 140,000 entries, mostly from 1930.
1849440	1852560	And so we can annotate this entire tree with information.
1852560	1857160	So Plato worked on the third man argument.
1857160	1863840	So we can, this is a picture so you can see a little bit more of the structure.
1863840	1869520	And the boxes with the green and blue, these have turquoise, I guess.
1869520	1873080	Those lines inside them are actually the names of the philosophers.
1873080	1876560	If you continue to zoom in, you can actually read the names.
1876560	1880520	So here you can read them.
1880520	1884760	Now there are other people who have attempted to create such graphs of philosophy.
1884760	1887800	This is a rather interesting one.
1887800	1896800	So you can see that he divides epochs in something like the way that we get, if we shame back
1896800	1900320	through the graph of the philosophy family tree.
1900320	1905480	And this is what it looks like when you focus in on those epochs.
1905480	1911000	And I was the editor of the moments to some time, which is founded by a gentleman called
1911000	1913760	Paul Keras.
1913760	1920040	And I've worked on these figures in the olden days when I used to do the history of philosophy.
1920040	1922520	So Plato worked on the third man argument.
1922520	1927120	Other people worked on the third man argument, so we can link them.
1927120	1933560	And we can identify philosophical fields, for instance, feminist philosophy of science,
1933560	1938720	by identifying within the tree all those philosophers who worked on feminist philosophy of science
1938720	1941680	or are working on feminist philosophy of science.
1941680	1947560	And similarly with philosophical groups, with epochs.
1948280	1953160	And now we can use this tagged data.
1953160	1960960	So we know many things about the people who are marked here as working within this epoch.
1960960	1962320	We know what problems they worked on.
1962320	1963960	We know what fields they belong to.
1963960	1966400	We know what groups they belong to and so forth.
1966400	1971840	We can use that tagged data in order to do semantically enhanced publishing.
1971840	1978440	In other words, to create tagged versions of philosophical texts, articles or books or
1978440	1986360	manuscripts along the same lines as we tagged biological texts using ontologies earlier
1986360	1989040	on in this talk.
1989040	2000080	All right, now, as I say, I have made some contributions to the humanities in my ontological
2001080	2002080	role.
2002080	2008120	And one of them was published in this volume called Thinking Through Digital Technology
2008120	2011360	in the Humanities and the Arts.
2011360	2017280	And the title of the paper you can see, I co-authored it with a colleague here in Buffalo called
2017280	2023600	Verna Koistus, who is, well, I don't dance at all, and so he is a much better dancer
2023600	2024600	than me.
2024600	2030720	He's also the division chief of the Division of Biomedical Ontology in the UB Department
2030720	2032360	of Biomedical Intimatics.
2032360	2040400	This is the only academic unit in the world which has ontology in its title.
2040400	2047000	And this is what he looks like when he's dancing.
2048000	2055040	And the issue is how do you define a half cut in Irish, well, how do you even pronounce
2055040	2058240	Sean Noth's dancing?
2058240	2064280	That's what we had to do in order to create the ontology of dancing.
2064280	2065280	That's the definition.
2065280	2071000	And so it's not a short movement of one lower leg crossing the other leg with the foot pointing
2071000	2079520	forward, because if I do that while standing in a bus queue, I'm not performing a half
2079520	2080520	cut.
2080520	2082600	I'm just moving my legs.
2082600	2089520	So in order to be a half cut, it has to be part of a dance, which is a certain cultural
2089520	2091360	phenomenon.
2091360	2096600	It can't be an epileptic jerk or it can't be kicking a football.
2096600	2103040	So the ontology of dance is more than an ontology of movement and it's more than an ontology
2103040	2106080	of legs and feet and so forth.
2106080	2108120	Although these have to be in the ontology.
2108120	2114800	We take them from the foundational model of anatomy, which is the standard anatomy ontology.
2114800	2115880	But we need more than that.
2115880	2122520	We need also the culture of dance, the music which dance is associated with and so forth.
2123000	2127480	Then we need to use the ontology to tag instance data.
2127480	2129240	And why would we do that?
2129240	2134840	Well, this is a question of history, discoverability.
2134840	2142600	So there are many, many pieces of data relating to choreography, dress patterns, music and
2142600	2146960	so on associated with dance in the course of history.
2146960	2152360	And some of this is in the form of literature and some of it is in Spanish.
2152360	2153440	Some of it is in English.
2153440	2155680	Some of it is in Latin and so forth.
2155680	2166320	And so in order to discover what the precursors of the quadri in, sorry, a 20th century Appalachian
2166320	2171640	square dance, what the precursors are in the 17th century English quadri, we need to have
2171640	2178560	a controlled vocabulary in which allows us to find the relevant sources.
2178560	2184440	And this actually is required by the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural
2184440	2191160	Heritage that we have to support the conditions when necessary for cultural reproduction.
2191160	2197520	That means we have to be able to understand descriptions of dances in ancient texts in
2197520	2202840	ways which modern users of language will be able to understand.
2202840	2206960	And that's exactly the kind of thing which ontology is designed to support.
2207480	2209080	Okay, so what do we do?
2209080	2215280	We build the dance sable, which is like the genome, but it's a collection of all the
2215280	2221040	data we have from any field pertaining to the history of dance, including journalism,
2221040	2227680	fiction, history, biographies, and paintings, photographs, videos and so forth.
2227680	2232440	All of those things can be collected and then they can be linked together by means of the
2232440	2238160	ontology, and we can do reasoning across all the data by using the logical facilities
2238160	2240280	which the ontology provides.
2240280	2245400	We can discover things that we didn't know about by using the ontology, the facilities
2245400	2249600	which the ontology provides, and so forth.
2249600	2255400	Now that's 110 slides, which is not bad, but I think I'm going to stop there.
2255400	2259080	So we also need a music ontology, dress ontology.
2259080	2263160	We have the body part ontology, but we need a body part movement ontology, and then of
2263160	2267400	course the dance ontology will be related to the emotion ontology for obvious reasons.
2267400	2268400	But now I really will stop.
