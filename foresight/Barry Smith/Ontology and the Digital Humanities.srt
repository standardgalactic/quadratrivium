1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,300
I'm going to start by explaining something about what ontology is and what it means to

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,040
apply ontology.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,740
So I guess everyone knows that ontology is an old sub-discipline of philosophy.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,500
So Aristotle already was doing ontology.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,740
Ontology now is also a branch of computer science.

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,820
So when we do digital humanities, then we are confronted very often with images like

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:36,680
this with hairballs representing data that we have about many different things, many

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,340
different subjects, many different people and so on.

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:46,680
So this is a hairball representing data about people who are prominent in the digital humanities

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,500
who engage on Twitter.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,380
It has no relevance at all to what I say next.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,460
But it's an example of the sort of data that we have, which could in principle be used

13
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,300
for research.

14
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,820
This is an example of political data that we have.

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:10,620
This is an example of how different journals make themselves felt, different humanities

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,660
and social science journals make themselves felt in Twitter again.

17
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,880
So there's lots of data like this and we could in principle use this data for interesting

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,160
research purposes.

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,440
And I just mentioned that data like this is being used all the time by people in biology

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,960
and medicine and similar subjects using ontologies.

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,120
So what can they do, which could also be done with data like this?

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,240
That's the question or the challenge that I'm going to address.

23
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:52,680
Now one way of addressing this challenge is to create what are called linked open data.

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,080
And the idea here is that if you have data about a specific subject, then that will be

25
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,520
described using certain terms.

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,840
And if you can organize these terms into a representation of the data, then you can link

27
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,040
it to other such organized representations of data.

28
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,040
In such a way that you can then reason across the data, you can draw conclusions from it.

29
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,560
And these are the areas which form this linked open data cloud.

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,960
This is basically a happy hunting ground for hackers who like to join data from different

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
areas.

32
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,120
So they use the linked open data cloud as a key to combining data.

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,760
And you can see there's too much of it.

34
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,840
It's very unlikely that you're going to create useful connections between data, which you

35
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,560
can use for research, unless you're a hacker.

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,720
So there's no way this can be done easily.

37
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,200
So you can read this.

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
You couldn't read.

39
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,200
This is a very early version of the linked open data cloud.

40
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,560
Now many of these modules within the linked open data cloud are ontologies.

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,920
So there's one up in the right hand corner called ontoworld.

42
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,000
I have no idea what that is, but it's an example of this kind of thing that you find in the

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,260
linked open data cloud.

44
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,760
This is an illustration of the freedom of the internet.

45
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,040
Anybody can add a new ontology or a new module to the linked open data cloud.

46
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,040
So I think the stuff on the left includes music ontologies, for instance.

47
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,840
I don't like that because it only works for hackers.

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,200
It only works for people who are willing to spend their days and their nights trying to

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,160
glue together very, very large numbers of data representations in useful ways.

50
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,240
If you're a hacker and if you know a lot about specific kinds of data, you can get real value

51
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:01,640
from the linked open data and from data, PDA and similar storehouses of data.

52
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:08,600
But I'm not a hacker and I'm assuming that not everyone on the call is a hacker and certainly

53
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:15,680
none of us is an expert on many of the areas of data that they might want to relate to.

54
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,960
That's the interestingness of new research.

55
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,720
You can try to engage with data in areas where you are not an expert.

56
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,000
You can't do that with the linked open data method.

57
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,920
The ontology method is more general than linked open data.

58
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:40,400
You can think of an ontology as a computable lexicon, sometimes called a controlled vocabulary.

59
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,000
The lexicon represents the types of entities in a given domain where you have data.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,920
The idea is that if people use controlled vocabularies that are public, consensus-based lexical resources,

61
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,720
then everybody will be able to find the data they need rather easily because they can look

62
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,760
in the catalogs of the controlled vocabularies and they can see where all the data about

63
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:15,480
viruses might be found or where all the data about Thai politics or Japanese cooking or

64
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,800
whatever it might be.

65
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,240
If you have controlled vocabularies for each of these areas, then this makes combining

66
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,440
data more easy.

67
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,720
Ontology is a method for creating controlled vocabularies of this sort, which are useful

68
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:38,880
both to humans and to people, and to humans and to computers.

69
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,400
That's what an ontology is.

70
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,240
It happens that UB is probably the world centre of ontology, at least measured by our impacts

71
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,400
and by the number of ontologies which are maintained here.

72
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,360
The grant funding that we've been receiving over the years, the number of faculties where

73
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,240
we have ontologists working, and so forth.

74
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:06,680
But the origins of ontology go back to the 1980s, and you see the name Tom Gruber here.

75
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:15,720
He is the most famous person in the early stages of ontology, and he's interesting today

76
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:25,240
because he is the inventor of the Siri app in your iPhone, which is based on ontologies.

77
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,080
Siri contains ontologies of restaurants, of movies.

78
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,440
This is what an ontology inside Siri looks like.

79
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:41,120
You have the names of the general types that you want to capture, types like city or state

80
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,760
or zip code, and then you have instances of those types, which are the particular cities

81
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,480
or states or zip codes where you might find restaurants or movies or whatever it might

82
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
be.

83
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,400
So this is a characteristic split in ontology land.

84
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,800
You have ontologies which are about universals, about general types, and then you have particulars

85
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,880
which are the instances of those general types.

86
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,720
And the Siri app is constantly growing with more and more data about restaurants and movies

87
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:19,640
and so forth, so that you can work out where you want to eat before you go to a movie tonight.

88
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,600
And what we're doing in biology is very similar.

89
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:32,360
So in biology, we have types like virus or coronavirus or SARS virus or COVID-19 virus.

90
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,400
These are all types, and then we have many, many instances in all the people who have

91
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,440
the corresponding diseases.

92
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,000
So there are journals devoted to ontology now.

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,720
One of these journals existed before the turn of the century.

94
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:56,360
There is a journal of biomedical semantics, which is about ontology of biomedicine.

95
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:04,480
Now in around the year 2000, with the conclusion of the human genome project, ontologies became

96
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:12,800
really important in biology and in medicine because the genomic data which was being discovered

97
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,320
is just huge sequences of chemical letters, letters of the alphabet.

98
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:24,960
It doesn't have any connection to the biological and medical things which are important, like

99
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:33,120
viruses or diseases or lungs or cell division or any of these other things which belong

100
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,720
to the old biology.

101
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:41,720
And the gene ontology, which is by far the most successful ontology in any domain, is

102
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:50,440
an ontology of old biology which was used systematically to tag sequences, gene sequences,

103
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,040
protein sequences, other kinds of sequences, and it thereby made sequence data usable to

104
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,200
people who wanted to do old biology or old medicine.

105
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,320
In other words, they wanted to study things like diseases.

106
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:12,080
Now so this is the paper in which the gene ontology was presented to the world.

107
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:20,200
It's been cited some 30,000 times, very influential, and the idea then led to copies.

108
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:27,160
People wanted to have ontologies for other parts of biology and for other areas.

109
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:36,720
So the people around the gene ontology who built these ontologies created an initiative

110
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,280
called the oboe foundry, the open biological and biomedical ontologies foundry.

111
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,120
I was one of the founders of this foundry.

112
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,160
They wanted originally to call it the smithy, but I vetoed that suggestion.

113
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,920
And you can see that the first ontology in the list of oboe foundry ontologies is called

114
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,840
basic formal ontology.

115
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,040
This is the top level ontology which joins all the other ontologies together within the

116
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,080
oboe foundry as a whole.

117
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,160
That ontology was more or less my creation.

118
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,120
That was 20 years ago.

119
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,240
And then this is a paper in which we capture the methodology for building consistent ontologies

120
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,000
across the whole domain of biomedicine.

121
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,680
This is in 2007.

122
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,360
Already in that year, the oboe foundry was beginning to show its successes in many areas

123
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,840
of biology and is still doing so.

124
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,080
All right.

125
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,360
So one way in which these ontologies are used is to tag literature.

126
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:46,200
So the colors here represent tags between phrases in a text and ontologies which have

127
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,160
been created for the domains treated in the text.

128
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:56,000
This is a bit like tagging sequence data, but now you're tagging textual data.

129
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And so that you can see it more clearly now when I've made the type bigger.

130
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,840
So the infection in the top right which is red is tagged red because it's tagged by

131
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,400
a term from the disease ontology which is indicated in the list of tabs at the top.

132
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
All right.

133
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,800
So now we tag sequence data.

134
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,760
We tag other kinds of data.

135
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,040
We tag clinical notes.

136
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,080
We tag literature in the abstract databases and so on.

137
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:32,240
And thereby we bring together, we create a network out of all of these different kinds

138
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,240
of data using ontology.

139
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,480
And this is just one of many different kinds of portals which enable you to search through

140
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,480
these data source using ontology and to reason over them in different ways.

141
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,920
I'm not going to go into any detail.

142
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,800
This works in biology, works in science generally because scientists have an incentive to use

143
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,760
the same general terms in all the work that they do.

144
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,800
Nobody wants to have multiple terms through the same thing in science.

145
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,880
That is not the way science works.

146
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:17,320
And the success of modern biology was achieved in large part through the use of common terms

147
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:24,760
to represent chemical symbols, DNA sequences and so forth.

148
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,680
But in the humanities, things are not like that.

149
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,320
There isn't much greater independence and creativity in terminological usage in the humanities.

150
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,600
In many cases, terms are not logically defined and there is no interest in logical definitions

151
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,760
because that's not what the humanities are primarily interested in.

152
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:53,080
Humanities, researchers are not doing science in the way that biologists, for instance, are

153
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
doing science.

154
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:00,200
And also there's a lack of ways of testing whether one or other interpretation of a text

155
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
is correct.

156
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,480
It could be that multiple interpretations are correct.

157
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,840
But new interpretations are important precisely because they're new.

158
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,160
They throw a new light on what was a text that people thought could be understood in

159
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,640
old ways so that there's a completely different attitude in the humanities.

160
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,640
Now I mentioned basic formal ontology.

161
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,000
This is just a fragment of it.

162
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,760
It has altogether 35 nodes.

163
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,440
These are just a few examples of nodes and the content doesn't matter.

164
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,800
I'm just illustrating the way the system works.

165
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,160
One interesting feature of BFO is that it's now an international standard.

166
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:48,240
So this is the first piece of philosophy that is useful enough to deserve being made into

167
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,720
an international standard.

168
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,400
This took three years of my life to get to the point where it's now been approved as

169
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
an international standard.

170
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,680
And that means that in the sciences, but also now in government and administration and

171
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:06,320
such circles, people use BFO and they have confidence that it's been validated by a very

172
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,880
strict process.

173
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,120
So this is BFO.

174
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,560
Now why is BFO important?

175
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,920
Because we can extend it.

176
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,800
So this is an extension of BFO into the realm of mental functioning, things like thinking,

177
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,680
planning, learning, and so forth.

178
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,760
And then we can extend that further to include emotions.

179
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,600
So this is a fragment of the emotion ontology.

180
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,600
And you see that we have behavioral processes.

181
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,680
We have subjective feelings.

182
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,440
We have action tendencies.

183
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,160
These are all parts of standard ways of viewing emotions.

184
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:51,520
And what the emotion ontology gives you is a control of vocabulary or describing emotions.

185
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,800
And so you can use this control of vocabulary to tag data coming from different sources,

186
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,400
which may be from psychology, but it may also be from literature or history, or it may also

187
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,240
be from studying texts, for instance.

188
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:15,280
So this is a consensus-based control of vocabulary for tagging all kinds of data, all kinds of

189
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,680
texts and so on about emotions.

190
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,640
And so this is what it looks like.

191
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:27,000
So emotion is based on some sort of appraisal.

192
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,760
An appraisal is a kind of cognitive representation.

193
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,800
And there are different kinds of appraisals which are shown around the circle here.

194
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,120
So there is an appraisal of social attention, appraisal of loss, appraisal of avoidability,

195
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,760
and so forth.

196
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,800
Depending on the appraisal, we have a different kind of emotion.

197
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Sometimes we have emotions spontaneously, and we don't cognitively come to any awareness

198
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
of the appraisal.

199
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,600
But there's an appraisal going on somehow, even if not in this particular moment.

200
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,960
And then we have types of physiological response to emotion.

201
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,080
So our muscles relax, our muscles become tense.

202
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,160
We breathe at a slower rate, we breathe at a more rapid rate, and so on.

203
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,720
So the emotional ontology contains all terms for all of these different kinds of physiological

204
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
response.

205
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,360
And then we have different kinds of feelings, feeling nervous, feeling bad, feeling tired,

206
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,080
feeling strong, and so on.

207
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:33,880
These are documented in the emotional ontology in a consensus-based, consistent way.

208
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,480
Moreover, for all of these terms, and for all the terms in all of the ontology, we

209
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,640
have human definitions, so natural language definitions, so that human beings can understand

210
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,360
what the terms mean.

211
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,600
But we also have logical definitions, so that computers can use these terms as a basis for

212
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,400
computational reasoning.

213
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:01,120
All right, now, we can now put different ontologies together.

214
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,360
So there is a chemistry ontology called kebi.

215
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:13,120
And emotions, as people who like drinking alcohol know, are closely related to chemistry.

216
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,240
And so using ontologies, we can build maps of what these relations are.

217
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,440
So happiness, for instance, is an emotion.

218
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:30,440
And happiness is, in fact, part of a certain kind of neurotransmitter receptor activity,

219
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,080
which is a gene ontology term.

220
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:41,440
And this neurotransmitter receptor activity is realized, sorry, it has as its realizer

221
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,080
a certain neurotransmitter, which is called dopamine.

222
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,880
So that is linking three ontologies together in order to give an account of what happiness

223
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
is.

224
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,040
And whether this is correct or incorrect, it's not so important.

225
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,960
What is important is to see how ontologies can enable you to link data of quite different

226
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,480
sorts in a consistent way.

227
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,960
And this is another story about sadness.

228
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,920
I don't think I will go into this, but you get the idea.

229
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:21,000
Depression is realized in a certain kind of sadness, which has as part the down-regulation

230
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,080
of the dopaminergic system.

231
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:29,600
All right, now we can apply this, for instance, to sentiment profiles for religious texts.

232
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,400
We have a canonical vocabulary for describing emotions or sentiments.

233
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,720
And we can use this vocabulary to map certain features of, for instance, religious texts.

234
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,840
So here the Koran is in pink and the Bible is in blue.

235
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,240
And you can see that in these areas, they're pretty much the same.

236
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:59,200
But so, for instance, joy and anger are very highly expressed in both the Bible and in

237
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
the Koran.

238
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,600
But here they disagree.

239
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:13,240
So the Koran emphasizes much more trust and fear and somewhat more fear and anxiety relative

240
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,720
to the Bible.

241
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,120
All right, so the emotional ontology lives on the web.

242
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,040
You can find it on the bio portal, which is a repository of ontologies.

243
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,880
There are other such repositories.

244
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,680
It's updated slowly by experts, such as me, for instance.

245
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,360
And it's tested in various different kinds of applications, for instance, applications

246
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,960
to understanding how people respond to lectures.

247
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:46,920
You can have them tick how they feel at certain times during the lecture using an app created

248
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,640
on the basis of the emotional ontology.

249
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:57,640
So now BFO is much more widely accepted now than it was when it first arose within the

250
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,920
oboe foundry research.

251
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:07,440
It's now used in some 350 ontology efforts, many of which are in biology and medicine,

252
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,520
but some of which are in other kinds of areas.

253
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,480
And I'll illustrate some of these in a minute.

254
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:20,040
So the interesting thing is that many of these ontologies are created or co-created or co-managed

255
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
here in Buffalo.

256
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,640
So this is just a few of those.

257
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,720
We have the collaborative behavior ontology.

258
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,680
We have a suite of common core ontologies, which are designed to cover a huge array of

259
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:42,640
areas such as nations, politics, law, government administration, and so on and so on.

260
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,840
Then as you can see, we have the coronavirus infectious disease ontology, which is part

261
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:54,600
of a whole suite of infectious disease ontologies, which is we've been building here with, in

262
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,720
fact, collaborators in other universities for some 10 years now.

263
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,160
We have a document act ontology, which is about, for instance, the ways in which we

264
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:12,760
use legal documents in order to perform certain acts, acts of signing or filling in or amending

265
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,760
and so forth.

266
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,640
And you've seen the emotional ontology.

267
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,080
We also have the environment ontology, and at the very bottom, you see the United Nations

268
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,040
Sustainable Development Goals ontology that is based in large part on the environment

269
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
ontology.

270
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,840
Then we have the information artifact ontology, which is a kind of ontologization of what

271
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:41,440
the Dublin core is trying to do with bibliographic and bibliometric terms.

272
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,200
And then we have some more disease ontologies, pain and so forth.

273
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,480
So there are people in, I think, four faculties that you'd be who are working on ontologies.

274
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,840
We have people in engineering, people in the dental school, people in the medical school,

275
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,800
people in the management school, and then we have people in College of Arts and Sciences.

276
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,880
Many of them are working directly with me or they're my students.

277
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,760
Some of them have come to Buffalo independently and then discovered ontology.

278
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,920
And I'm hoping that in the humanities, digital humanities field, we can find new opportunities

279
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,720
for collaborations of this sort.

280
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,560
All right, now there's also a book, which I wrote with two former students, which is

281
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,880
a guidebook to building, well, you can see what it's a guidebook for.

282
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,960
Now let's talk a little bit about what it means to have an international standard.

283
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,440
So the International Standards Organization and the International Electro-Technical Commission

284
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,120
have a joint technical committee, which was the committee which was responsible for the BFO standard.

285
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,360
And one of the things that they do is world plugs.

286
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,000
So if you travel, which some people used to do in the olden times, you need to carry plugs

287
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,840
and it's good to know that the plugs that you carry will fit.

288
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,400
And so the International Electro-Technical Commission ensures that there is a relatively

289
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,560
small number of options for plugs of any given type.

290
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:26,120
So these are the areas of the globe in which the different types of plugs are used.

291
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,400
And this is a better map.

292
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,000
So you see most of them use the same kind of plug, but not the United States nor the

293
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,360
United Kingdom, both of whom are outliers.

294
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,240
And the reason for the English-speaking world is an outlier.

295
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,600
These are the countries using plugs and sockets to type E.

296
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,320
And so it goes on like this.

297
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,800
Now the reason I'm telling you all of this is because that's what we do when we maintain

298
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,160
a library.

299
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:05,840
So Dublin Core and before that the Library of Congress had various different kinds of

300
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,160
information that they needed to fit with other kinds of information.

301
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,720
And gradually, as the computer became more important to the workings of a library, it

302
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,320
was necessary to make these various different types of information fit together.

303
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,160
And that's what the Dublin Core tries to do.

304
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,400
Now the Dublin Core is an example of an ontology.

305
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,800
It's a very widely used ontology.

306
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,560
It doesn't have all the qualities that an ontology can have.

307
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,680
So it can't support logical reasoning in the way that, for instance, the gene ontology

308
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,880
or the emotion ontology can.

309
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,920
But still, it's an ontology and it's an ontology which is standardized over many libraries and

310
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,320
helps to make sure the different kinds of information fit, but also that you can find

311
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,840
different kinds of information more easily because they've been standardized in their

312
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,840
typology.

313
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:07,080
All right, now I did something similar, again with actually the former collaborator, for

314
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:13,560
philosophy, so creating an ontology philosophy, viewing philosophy now in the old-fashioned

315
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,080
sense according to which philosophy is part of the humanities.

316
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,200
So what would such an ontology look like?

317
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,040
Well, first of all, we can look at the relations.

318
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:32,200
We've joined together the main kinds of entity, the main types in the philosophical field.

319
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:38,320
So we have philosophers who are persons, and then we have groups of philosophers, and then

320
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:45,800
we have the concepts which those philosophers engage with, and then we have fields, fields

321
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,000
and philosophical entities more generally.

322
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,640
And now there are relations between them.

323
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,440
So a person can be a member of a group.

324
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,520
One group can be a subgroup of another group.

325
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,600
A person or a group can work on a concept, and the person or a group can be active in

326
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,200
a field and so on.

327
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,320
So this is not rocket science, this is just trying to make things fit clearly so that

328
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,080
you can keep track of the data that you have in a consistent way.

329
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:23,280
So these are some examples of relations in the Philonto, so Kant is an instance of philosopher

330
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:29,480
and concept is a subcategory of philosophical entity and so on.

331
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,640
And then the bottom line here, disjoint concept proposition and so forth, that means that no

332
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,160
concept is a proposition, no proposition is a concept, no concept is a theory, no theory

333
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,480
is a concept and so on.

334
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,680
And then philosophy as a whole is the all-encompassing philosophical field.

335
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:56,640
So every philosophy is a part, sorry, every philosophical field is a part of the all-encompassing

336
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,680
philosophical field called philosophy.

337
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:07,760
Now you can't see all of this, but once we start building the ontology it gets very big.

338
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:15,120
So because we have all these subfields, and if you imagine a gigantic extended graph with

339
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,280
philosophy at the top, and then you have all of these various subfields below it.

340
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,240
So this is just the graph of the subfields of philosophy.

341
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:32,320
Then we have geographic areas because philosophers lived in certain areas at certain times and

342
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,920
in certain parts of the globe, and so we organized the ontology in such a way that we can capture

343
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:46,280
these kinds of information too, and that's a very, very simple part of the historical

344
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,560
period and geographical area treatments of the ontology.

345
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:59,160
And so we can say that Plato is a metaphysician who worked on these arguments here listed

346
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,040
down the right-hand side.

347
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,880
He was a realist about forms, he was an ancient Greek philosopher, and ancient Greeks philosophers

348
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:12,280
include, is part of both ancient philosophers and Greek philosophers.

349
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,640
So what can we do with this?

350
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Well, we have a map of all philosophers, all philosophers who were listed.

351
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,480
I'll explain where this map comes from in a minute.

352
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,480
So if you imagine every dot on this map is a philosopher, the dots in the middle of the

353
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:34,640
little cycles here are the supervisors, the PhD supervisors of the people on the edges

354
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,280
of the ring.

355
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,960
So truly influential people have big rings of followers around them.

356
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:49,040
And every dot is a person who is an instance of the type philosopher.

357
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:57,400
And this is the same information now expressed as a list rather than as a big graph.

358
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,680
So this is the Leibniz lineage.

359
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,040
Peter Hare was the chair of the philosophy department here at BUB for many years.

360
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:11,080
And he is part of the Leibniz lineage in the sense that there is a line from Peter Hare

361
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,520
through his supervisor all the way back to Leibniz.

362
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,960
This is a bit of a cheat because Leibniz was not, in fact, the doctoral supervisor of Bernoulli.

363
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,560
They didn't really have the supervisor system in 1663.

364
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:32,160
But it's leaving aside that wrinkle, this is a picture of the doctor-father-student

365
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,240
relation.

366
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:41,280
This is the Menke lineage, which is less interesting, but it includes the immediate former chair

367
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:46,120
of BUB, namely David Hirshinoff.

368
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,880
And this is the Weiser lineage, which is also less interesting than the Leibniz lineage,

369
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,520
which includes me and so forth.

370
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:03,120
Now this is, all right, and now we have subtypes of philosopher.

371
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,520
And you can see how complicated this graph is going to get once we organize it carefully

372
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
and represent it.

373
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,000
But still, it's not difficult to do this kind of work.

374
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,760
There will be some overlaps, which will be difficult, but in general, we can get a lot

375
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:26,560
of the easy parts done very quickly, and then we can create relations like I illustrated

376
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
before.

377
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:32,040
Now the big graph that I showed you and the tablets form something called the philosophy

378
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:40,040
family tree, which describes itself as an academic genealogy of philosophers based on

379
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:49,440
this link of Dr. Supervisor, and they have 140,000 entries, mostly from 1930.

380
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,560
And so we can annotate this entire tree with information.

381
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,160
So Plato worked on the third man argument.

382
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:03,840
So we can, this is a picture so you can see a little bit more of the structure.

383
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,520
And the boxes with the green and blue, these have turquoise, I guess.

384
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,080
Those lines inside them are actually the names of the philosophers.

385
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,560
If you continue to zoom in, you can actually read the names.

386
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,520
So here you can read them.

387
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,760
Now there are other people who have attempted to create such graphs of philosophy.

388
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,800
This is a rather interesting one.

389
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:36,800
So you can see that he divides epochs in something like the way that we get, if we shame back

390
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,320
through the graph of the philosophy family tree.

391
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,480
And this is what it looks like when you focus in on those epochs.

392
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,000
And I was the editor of the moments to some time, which is founded by a gentleman called

393
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,760
Paul Keras.

394
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,040
And I've worked on these figures in the olden days when I used to do the history of philosophy.

395
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,520
So Plato worked on the third man argument.

396
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,120
Other people worked on the third man argument, so we can link them.

397
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,560
And we can identify philosophical fields, for instance, feminist philosophy of science,

398
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,720
by identifying within the tree all those philosophers who worked on feminist philosophy of science

399
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,680
or are working on feminist philosophy of science.

400
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,560
And similarly with philosophical groups, with epochs.

401
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,160
And now we can use this tagged data.

402
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:40,960
So we know many things about the people who are marked here as working within this epoch.

403
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,320
We know what problems they worked on.

404
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,960
We know what fields they belong to.

405
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,400
We know what groups they belong to and so forth.

406
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,840
We can use that tagged data in order to do semantically enhanced publishing.

407
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:58,440
In other words, to create tagged versions of philosophical texts, articles or books or

408
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:06,360
manuscripts along the same lines as we tagged biological texts using ontologies earlier

409
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,040
on in this talk.

410
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:20,080
All right, now, as I say, I have made some contributions to the humanities in my ontological

411
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
role.

412
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,120
And one of them was published in this volume called Thinking Through Digital Technology

413
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,360
in the Humanities and the Arts.

414
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,280
And the title of the paper you can see, I co-authored it with a colleague here in Buffalo called

415
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,600
Verna Koistus, who is, well, I don't dance at all, and so he is a much better dancer

416
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
than me.

417
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:50,720
He's also the division chief of the Division of Biomedical Ontology in the UB Department

418
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,360
of Biomedical Intimatics.

419
00:33:52,360 --> 00:34:00,400
This is the only academic unit in the world which has ontology in its title.

420
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:07,000
And this is what he looks like when he's dancing.

421
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,040
And the issue is how do you define a half cut in Irish, well, how do you even pronounce

422
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,240
Sean Noth's dancing?

423
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,280
That's what we had to do in order to create the ontology of dancing.

424
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
That's the definition.

425
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,000
And so it's not a short movement of one lower leg crossing the other leg with the foot pointing

426
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,520
forward, because if I do that while standing in a bus queue, I'm not performing a half

427
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
cut.

428
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,600
I'm just moving my legs.

429
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:49,520
So in order to be a half cut, it has to be part of a dance, which is a certain cultural

430
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,360
phenomenon.

431
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,600
It can't be an epileptic jerk or it can't be kicking a football.

432
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:03,040
So the ontology of dance is more than an ontology of movement and it's more than an ontology

433
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,080
of legs and feet and so forth.

434
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,120
Although these have to be in the ontology.

435
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:14,800
We take them from the foundational model of anatomy, which is the standard anatomy ontology.

436
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,880
But we need more than that.

437
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:22,520
We need also the culture of dance, the music which dance is associated with and so forth.

438
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,480
Then we need to use the ontology to tag instance data.

439
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,240
And why would we do that?

440
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,840
Well, this is a question of history, discoverability.

441
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:42,600
So there are many, many pieces of data relating to choreography, dress patterns, music and

442
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,960
so on associated with dance in the course of history.

443
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,360
And some of this is in the form of literature and some of it is in Spanish.

444
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,440
Some of it is in English.

445
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,680
Some of it is in Latin and so forth.

446
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:06,320
And so in order to discover what the precursors of the quadri in, sorry, a 20th century Appalachian

447
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,640
square dance, what the precursors are in the 17th century English quadri, we need to have

448
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:18,560
a controlled vocabulary in which allows us to find the relevant sources.

449
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,440
And this actually is required by the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural

450
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:31,160
Heritage that we have to support the conditions when necessary for cultural reproduction.

451
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:37,520
That means we have to be able to understand descriptions of dances in ancient texts in

452
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,840
ways which modern users of language will be able to understand.

453
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,960
And that's exactly the kind of thing which ontology is designed to support.

454
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,080
Okay, so what do we do?

455
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:55,280
We build the dance sable, which is like the genome, but it's a collection of all the

456
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,040
data we have from any field pertaining to the history of dance, including journalism,

457
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,680
fiction, history, biographies, and paintings, photographs, videos and so forth.

458
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,440
All of those things can be collected and then they can be linked together by means of the

459
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,160
ontology, and we can do reasoning across all the data by using the logical facilities

460
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,280
which the ontology provides.

461
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,400
We can discover things that we didn't know about by using the ontology, the facilities

462
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,600
which the ontology provides, and so forth.

463
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:35,400
Now that's 110 slides, which is not bad, but I think I'm going to stop there.

464
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,080
So we also need a music ontology, dress ontology.

465
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,160
We have the body part ontology, but we need a body part movement ontology, and then of

466
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,400
course the dance ontology will be related to the emotion ontology for obvious reasons.

467
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
But now I really will stop.
