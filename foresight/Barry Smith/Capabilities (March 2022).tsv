0	10440	We've been working on capabilities now for about three years, and we've gone to and
10440	13640	fro on how we want to understand capabilities.
13640	22000	I now believe that we have a stable view, which works for all the counter examples that
22000	27080	people had been bringing forward, provided we accept certain caveats about how we're
27080	28920	understanding capability.
28920	35720	And the idea is that there are many words like capacity, ability, power, which have
35720	39280	similar meanings to the word capability.
39280	44000	We just want to standardize on one meaning of the word capability, which will be compatible
44000	51680	with BFO, whether we introduce the word capability into BFO is still an open question.
51680	57560	So this is BFO, and we're interested, and BFO is now an international standard.
57560	63320	It's been approved, and you can find the relevant files here.
63320	70760	So you can now see the entire ISO file content if you go to the right place, which is unusual.
70760	77680	Usually you have to pay 195 Swiss francs to get the PDF version of the ISO standard.
77680	86400	So we're interested particularly in material entities, such as people and laptops on the
86400	94840	one hand, and in dispositions and roles, primarily in dispositions.
94840	100320	Capabilities are going to turn out to be a subkind of disposition.
100320	107960	But we're interested in roles because we have to distinguish those kinds of capability-like
107960	113080	entities, which are in fact roles rather than dispositions.
113080	119040	Those roles and dispositions are realisables in BFO terms, and I think we all know what
119040	126000	realisable means, so an attribute of a material entity is a realisable if there is a certain
126000	131560	kind of process which manifests it, makes it manifest, makes it appear.
131560	139520	So going bald is a disposition which all males possess, and this disposition is realized
139520	144440	in processes of losing hair.
144440	151560	And so now dispositions are well-known, cases of realisables, roles are well-known, cases
151560	157720	of realisables, functions are a special kind of disposition, and we're going to introduce
157720	160720	now capabilities.
160720	167080	Dispositions in general include bad things like losing hair.
167080	172360	These are good things like thinking or speaking.
172360	176880	Functions are really good things, as we shall see.
176880	183840	And then roles are those things, those attributes which we have in virtue of some social convention
183840	186160	or social description.
186160	193840	So being king or being the owner or being a renter are all matters which hold independently
193840	199840	of any kind of physical changes, where functions, capabilities and dispositions, all of which
199840	207960	are dispositions, have to occur, physical changes have to occur before they exist.
207960	216160	All right, so this is where function goes in BFO, and a function is a disposition which
216160	221080	is the raison d'être of its bearer.
221360	225960	Functions don't like it when I say raison d'être, because they think that that sounds
225960	233360	like teleology, but functions are teleological entities which exist in the world.
233360	242800	And they exist because there has to be entities of that sort, for reasons of survival and
242800	249400	reproduction in the case of biological functions and for reasons of need or desire in the case
249440	255120	of artifactual functions.
255120	263040	So the BFO idea is that only material entities have functions, and they have that function
263040	268040	for as long as the disposition remains a real physical possibility.
268040	275080	So if I have a heat pump in my attic, and my attic becomes so full that I can't enter
275080	279880	the attic to switch on the heat pump, and maybe things solidify, so it's impossible
279880	282840	for any person to go into the attic.
282840	288200	The function of the heat pump is still the same, it's to pump heat.
288200	295280	So functions in particular and dispositions in general are merely a matter of the intrinsic
295280	297520	physical possibilities of the bearer.
297520	302560	The environment doesn't matter, where for the roles, the environment and particularly
302560	307160	the social environment is the only thing which matters.
307160	314320	So a very sick heart still has the function to pump block, even if it can only just pump.
314320	320480	Maybe even if it can't pump at all because it's been removed temporarily from its hosts,
320480	322760	it still has the function to pump block.
322760	330200	So you're saying this is only a material entity?
330200	332720	Only material entities have functions.
332720	335840	This is just a terminological declaration.
335840	340920	This is Humpty Dumpty, words mean just what I want them to mean.
340920	343360	So you can't argue with it, it's just a...
343360	344360	Excellent.
344360	348520	So what is the function of that?
348520	355360	So it doesn't have a function in the BFO sense.
355360	357320	We can come back to that later.
357320	360800	All right, so this definition of function is perfectly standard.
360800	367960	So this is the Millican selective effect theory, which is also the genontology theory of function.
367960	370800	But BFO extends it to include artifacts.
370800	378440	So not only organic entities such as your heart have a function, but also your pen,
378440	383000	your laptop, the overhead projector and so forth.
383000	391680	They all have functions and there are two kinds of function, biological and artifactual.
391680	395160	Now capabilities.
395160	401800	Once we dealt with functions, we realized that there are other realisables left over.
401800	410040	So a lathe operator is trained to operate a lathe, but it's not the function of the
410040	413760	lathe operator to operate a lathe.
413760	418440	It's not clear that a lathe operator has any function, but he certainly has a capability
418440	422040	to operate a lathe because he's been trained.
422040	427280	So this is the first place where capability comes into this picture.
427280	435680	The chairman of the board has the authority to hire people or fire people or change the
435680	437840	regulations of the company.
437840	439960	That is a role.
439960	446460	Now given that he has that role, he can do things.
446460	451040	But that's not capability in the sense here, because it's not physical, it's not a matter
451040	454360	of physics, it's a matter of social norms.
454360	456920	And so we're going to ignore roles henceforth.
456920	462040	We're only interested in capabilities.
462040	463040	All right.
463040	467800	Now these are the kinds of entities which can have functions.
467800	473040	I don't think organisms have functions, but I'm willing to accept that the functions
473040	479880	of organisms might be to survive and to reproduce, so purely basic biological functions.
479880	484960	But generally speaking, parts of organisms have functions.
484960	489800	All your organs have functions, all your organ systems have functions, all your nephrons
489800	491440	have functions.
491440	495800	So the organism is full of functional parts.
495800	500740	And then all machines, all designed artifacts have functions because that's the definition
500740	502760	of the word artifact.
502760	509160	They are entities which were designed to perform a certain process.
509160	513840	And that means that they were designed to have a function, which is realized in that
513840	515600	process.
515600	526520	And then I think organizations have functions to help the poor to promote the pursuit of
526520	528720	good ontology.
528720	532320	These are functions of organization.
532320	536240	Now the queen bee or worker bees may have functions.
536240	541280	So it may be that for colonial organisms there are more specific functions than just surviving
541280	543840	and reproducing.
543840	547000	Now we're still on the level of intuitions.
547000	550160	We don't have a definition of capability yet.
550160	555840	But it's clear that my car has many more functions, sorry, many more capabilities than it has
555840	562320	functions, probably infinitely many more.
562320	566400	And I've just listed a few here.
566400	572240	And nowadays car manufacturers build many, many capabilities into their cars.
572240	579600	So to allow you to experience G-forces for instance seems to be a new, in Houston anyway
579600	588720	seems to be a new thing that cars have the capability to do and to impress your neighbors.
588720	592760	So there are many more kinds of entities which can have capabilities.
592760	597120	So these are all entities which can have functions.
597120	599120	They can also have capabilities.
599120	608520	But then these are entities which can have capabilities, which can't have function.
608520	617760	Because organisms can do things like dancing, the Foxtrot, ruling China.
617760	620960	And groups of organisms can do things like that too.
620960	628120	And also undesigned parts of nature can do things, like caves and so forth, which are
628120	632120	good for us, which we would like to happen.
632120	637000	So the world of capabilities is wider than the world of functions, all right.
637000	644360	Now this is work which is going to happen within BFO and so we have certain formal constraints.
644360	650160	The first formal constraint is every function is a capability and this is trivial.
650160	658600	If you're designed to perform a certain job then you're designed to execute your function
658600	661320	but that means you have the capability of executing your function.
661320	665320	So every function is a capability.
665320	672760	And the second formal constraint is that every capability is a disposition.
672760	679560	And this is, again, just for the sake of having a place for capability within the collection
679560	683640	of BFO-conformant ontologies.
683640	685400	And so it looks like this.
685400	691920	We have dispositions, a proper subset of dispositions are capabilities, a proper subset of capabilities
691920	692920	of functions.
692920	699120	And these things sometimes have role-like counterparts, but we won't deal with those.
699120	700560	This is the definition.
700560	706920	This has taken a long time and it really does work and it copes with apparent counter-examples
706920	711600	to some of the things we want to say about capabilities, which were problems for earlier
711600	714040	definitions that we were experimenting with.
714040	716240	So this is it.
716240	724040	Disposition in whose realization some organism or group of organisms has an interest.
724040	730360	And it's important that an entity which has been lying underground for hundreds of years
730360	737040	and which has the capability of threshing a certain kind of wheat which no longer grows
737040	744320	anywhere on earth, still, because it's been physically unchanged, has the capability of
744320	749240	threshing that kind of wheat.
749240	752000	Even though no one will ever want to exercise that capability.
752000	760280	And that's purely in order to save the axiom that every capability is a disposition.
760280	761280	All right.
761280	765560	So now we have some axioms which hold of capabilities.
765560	773160	So if a part of an organism has a function, then that organism itself has an interest
773160	776200	in the realization of that function.
776200	779040	And so that organism has that capability.
779040	786840	So we can apply the interest definition of capability to organic entities like hearts
786840	790560	and nephrons and digestive systems and so forth.
790560	793160	All of those are capabilities.
793160	801120	This is trivial because they're already functions, but still it's an important way to illustrate
801120	804640	the role of interest.
804640	815600	Now that biological axiom implies that we have many interests of which we know nothing.
815600	823160	And for many millions of years, organisms had many, many interests of which they knew
823160	828320	nothing of any of those interests.
828320	834640	Now because organisms, because interests can exist even though we don't know about them,
834640	839240	this follows that capabilities can be discovered.
839240	848880	So there are many unknown capabilities in the world and some of them can be discovered.
848880	854040	Whenever we make a plan, we have an interest in the realization of all the processes prescribed
854040	855160	by that plan.
855160	865600	And so if those are processes which are real possibilities, then they are capabilities.
865600	875280	And facilitation in the prescription axiom, actually no, then there is a facilitation
875280	877280	axiom.
877280	883440	If someone has an interest in realizing a disposition D and if the realization of some
883440	890380	other disposition D prime facilitates the realization of D, then that someone has an
890380	894520	interest in the realization of D prime.
894520	904440	And so facilitates here means either that D prime's realization is necessary for D to
904440	913640	exist or that D prime's realization occurring would improve the grade of the realization
913640	914640	of D.
914640	921640	And mentioning grade here introduces the topic of gradeability, yes, Jupps?
921640	928640	So if the facilitation also includes, the form of grade would improve the grade of the
928640	932640	latter, then why can your axiom be like this?
932640	935640	If you could only include the master card, it would be necessity.
935640	939640	Then it would be with the axiom, which would go to the axiom again.
939640	944640	But there may also be, X may have an interest in realizing the prescription D, but maybe
944640	948640	not in D because facilitation is not a necessity.
948640	955640	So he might say, D can be realized slower, if D prime facilitates and then I have D
955640	957640	faster, I maybe don't want this.
957640	962640	So he will not want D prime, but still want D because he's interested in the slow realization
962640	967640	of D. I could like, like getting, like eating a meal slowly, but eating it quickly.
967640	968640	Yes.
968640	969640	And so on and so forth.
969640	970640	So can you...
970640	975640	If the facilitation is necessary for the realization of D, then I suppose...
975640	980640	So that isn't a worry that has gone through my mind, but you've just given me a good example.
980640	981640	Can you write it down?
981640	983640	And we'll talk about it later.
983640	990640	So I need to think this through.
990640	991640	All right.
991640	996640	So gradeability has been in the theory of capabilities from the beginning.
996640	1000640	So it's an important feature of functions that they're gradeable.
1000640	1003640	And it's important feature of capabilities that they're gradeable.
1003640	1007640	So your heart has the function to pump blood.
1007640	1013640	And when it's functioning in a prototypical way, then it's doing its job.
1013640	1020640	And it can deviate from doing that job more and more, but then the heart is no longer functioning
1020640	1023640	and you're dead.
1023640	1029640	So that's when the function and the capability go out of existence.
1029640	1037640	And this is the extreme form of gradeability, zero score on the gradeability change.
1037640	1040640	But all capabilities have gradeability in that sense.
1040640	1045640	And that goes hand in hand with the fact that capabilities are what we learn in school.
1045640	1054640	So we were learning earlier today about how education is to either create capabilities
1054640	1059640	or increase the grade of capabilities.
1059640	1064640	Capabilities like functions are permanent, so they last for so long as the disposition,
1064640	1069640	which they are the disposition, exists as a real physical possibility.
1069640	1076640	So this is a summary which just lists the definitions in the order which I gave them.
1076640	1083640	And now this is a restatement of how the diagram works.
1083640	1087640	So dispositions sometimes are such that we have an interest in their realization
1087640	1089640	and then they become capabilities.
1089640	1094640	And capabilities, some of them, are in fact the reason for the existence of the bearer,
1094640	1096640	and that's when we have functions.
1096640	1099640	Can you go back to the previous slide?
1099640	1103640	There's a permanent capabilities of permanent.
1103640	1107640	Permanent until the real physical possibility ceases to exist.
1107640	1112640	So you break the thing, or you...
1112640	1117640	So you take the language...
1117640	1122640	Which I'm coming to.
1122640	1126640	You forget the language.
1126640	1130640	Then the capability ceases to exist.
1130640	1135640	So permanent as long as the real physical possibility exists.
1135640	1140640	So long as you have the real physical possibility of speaking English, you have the capability.
1140640	1145640	If you forget it, and then we have to teach it to you all over again,
1145640	1150640	that's a new capability.
1150640	1152640	Bill?
1152640	1158640	Oh, I guess I was thinking about things like offering...
1158640	1167640	Yes, so if you find that Remdesivir has the capability of curing COVID,
1167640	1173640	let's suppose you find that, then it's still not the function of Remdesivir to cure COVID.
1173640	1180640	But if you then make new Remdesivir pills, are they pills?
1180640	1181640	Yes.
1181640	1189640	And put COVID pill on the box, then the function of those new pills is to cure COVID.
1189640	1195640	Remdesivir is talking about things like aspirin that get prescribed for pain relief,
1195640	1199640	and also it has a blood thinner.
1199640	1205640	So first of all, many things have multiple functions, particularly organic things.
1205640	1213640	I understand it seems like there was a social shift there, not necessarily...
1213640	1215640	So it's all...
1215640	1221640	Yeah, it's all a question of raison d'etre.
1221640	1225640	But look, there's also all selected in the definition.
1225640	1228640	So I mean, most of the...
1228640	1231640	Since Earth exists, most of the time there have not been humans around,
1231640	1235640	good design and things, but then all the functions were selected by nature.
1235640	1237640	So that's what this is supposed to mean, right?
1237640	1238640	Yeah.
1239640	1246640	Yeah, I think that drug ontology slide with what's the generic for well-vutron and anti-depressant,
1246640	1250640	that subsequently got repurposed for smoking cessation.
1250640	1251640	Right.
1251640	1254640	That bucropin or something like that.
1254640	1259640	And when it's branded as well-vutron, its function is anti-depressant.
1259640	1266640	When it's branded as the other drug, brand name, its function is to not smoke,
1266640	1268640	they both have both capabilities.
1268640	1269640	Yeah.
1269640	1272640	So I think that it works for rebranding like that.
1272640	1273640	It's not...
1273640	1274640	It's in more labor.
1274640	1276640	You can have multiple functions in one...
1276640	1277640	Right.
1277640	1278640	Yeah.
1278640	1280640	Like well-vutron does not have the anti-smoking...
1280640	1284640	No, but SSRI is a multiple function in more labor.
1284640	1285640	No, it's not.
1285640	1286640	It's got all those functions.
1286640	1287640	It's alright.
1287640	1288640	It's alright.
1288640	1293640	But if a new function is assigned to it, because you give it to drivers,
1293640	1298640	then it's added and then you have a new function until the second period.
1298640	1304640	So I guess I think about this a little bit from a data annotator standpoint.
1304640	1306640	And I'm trying to...
1306640	1308640	You know, I have all these drugs.
1308640	1310640	I have these drugs in different names.
1310640	1312640	And I run across and I say,
1312640	1315640	wow, should I say this is the capability of the drug,
1315640	1319640	the disposition of the drug, the function of the drug.
1319640	1324640	And I can draw some pretty clear guidelines into a function of disposition.
1324640	1331640	But what I mean by this is that capability of disposition or...
1331640	1332640	So every...
1332640	1333640	No, no, no.
1333640	1334640	To me...
1334640	1337640	Every capability is a disposition.
1337640	1340640	So you're always safe to use disposition.
1340640	1344640	And I think that it's actually going to make your life easier.
1344640	1348640	You can always use capability if you're not sure what the function is.
1348640	1353640	So if you know that this pill has the capability to cure depression,
1353640	1359640	because it says so on the label, then if you're not sure whether that's its function,
1359640	1362640	then you just put capability.
1362640	1365640	And the capability will be important later, as we will see.
1365640	1371640	For drugs, it's not so important whether you get the function capability label right.
1371640	1374640	But for other things, it is important.
1374640	1386640	I could just see differences arising across multiple annotations of local capability
1386640	1388640	or the disposition.
1388640	1389640	So that would...
1389640	1393640	And maybe that doesn't matter much, because they're all disposition.
1393640	1394640	Yeah, exactly.
1394640	1398640	But I think people might not like that kind of funny,
1398640	1402640	because they might want their clear, clean lines between their options.
1403640	1407640	So actually, you are pointing to an issue.
1407640	1413640	One and the same disposition can be a capability in the eyes of some people
1413640	1418640	and a mere disposition in the eyes of other people in important ways,
1418640	1421640	which are a matter of life and death, as we shall see.
1421640	1424640	So you're right to point out this issue, but I don't think...
1424640	1428640	I think the issue is so clear that the annotators will not have a problem.
1428640	1430640	But we'll see when we get to that.
1430640	1433640	So this is the diagram.
1433640	1440640	Now, there are some simple rules which enable you to tack back and forth between capabilities and functions.
1440640	1446640	So it's very often the case that if a whole has a capability,
1446640	1450640	then this is because it has some part which has a function.
1450640	1455640	So my car can play music because I have a stereo system in my car.
1455640	1465640	And my digestive system can digest food, has a function to digest food,
1465640	1469640	and therefore I can digest food, but that also causes problems.
1469640	1474640	So I have a capability to digest specific kinds of food,
1474640	1477640	but my digestive system is generic.
1477640	1480640	Its function is not to digest specific kinds of food.
1480640	1484640	That means not that there's anything wrong with the theory,
1484640	1488640	but that this general rule does not work in general.
1488640	1493640	It's a general rule because it works often, but it doesn't work always.
1493640	1495640	All right.
1495640	1502640	So for organisms, we have two kinds of capabilities.
1502640	1509640	First of all, to survive and to reproduce or anything which promotes both of those, such as eating.
1509640	1517640	Organisms have the capability to convert energy in their environment at ATP.
1517640	1520640	Is that the correct statement?
1520640	1529640	So organisms have the ability to synthesize ATP.
1529640	1533640	Because that's necessary for their survival and reproduction.
1533640	1538640	But then they also have capabilities which go beyond merely biological capabilities.
1538640	1542640	That's trivial.
1542640	1549640	Machines have capabilities because organisms have an interest in their doing things.
1549640	1552640	And those organisms might be the owner of the machine,
1552640	1556640	or the worker in the factory where the machine is made,
1556640	1559640	or it might be a patient in an ICU or a passenger.
1559640	1562640	So there are many kinds of organisms who have many kinds of interests
1562640	1567640	in the realizations of the capabilities of machines.
1568640	1571640	Better in the realizations of the dispositions of those machines
1571640	1575640	and therefore those dispositions are by the definition capabilities.
1575640	1577640	And then we have great ability.
1577640	1582640	So we can grade the realizations of capabilities from on a scale.
1582640	1588640	But that means we also have abnormal realizations,
1588640	1592640	which are not capabilities, but disabilities.
1592640	1597640	So shopping addiction, for instance.
1597640	1601640	If we realize the capability to go shopping too much,
1601640	1606640	then we have something which is no longer a capability, Simplicita.
1606640	1615640	It's a capability which has to be counterbalanced against the abnormal realization.
1615640	1617640	And this is true for many capabilities,
1617640	1622640	that they bring about abnormal side effects, which are not capabilities.
1624640	1628640	And now we come to Bill's problem, Bill Duncan's problem.
1628640	1629640	Yeah.
1634640	1636640	That's a good question.
1639640	1645640	I imagine that there are some animals who chased prey too quickly
1645640	1647640	and suffer from that.
1648640	1650640	But I don't know.
1653640	1658640	So what is a capability in one context may be a disability in another.
1658640	1663640	So the capability to kill without feelings of guilt.
1665640	1669640	Normally we would regard that as a disability,
1669640	1673640	but in the mafia that is regarded as a capability.
1676640	1681640	And there are many such cases where in one community or one context,
1681640	1686640	a disposition is regarded as something good in which we have an interest,
1686640	1689640	and in another context it's regarded as something bad.
1694640	1699640	Then, okay, so they might regard it as your function,
1699640	1703640	but they wouldn't be right because in BFO terms it's not your function.
1704640	1706640	Because it's not your raison d'etre.
1707640	1708640	All right.
1710640	1714640	And now here are the areas where capabilities data is going to be important.
1714640	1717640	First of all, with regard to education and training,
1717640	1719640	which is why great ability is important,
1719640	1722640	with regard to hiring and promotion,
1724640	1727640	all human capital has to do with the capabilities
1727640	1729640	that the possessor of the human capital has.
1730640	1735640	Consulting, I believe, is largely a process of increasing,
1735640	1740640	adding to or increasing the grade of capabilities of organizations.
1742640	1746640	A capability data is important when you're doing mission planning
1746640	1750640	in large organizations like military organizations where they have.
1750640	1756640	In the DOD they have a whole department devoted to keeping track
1756640	1760640	of the capabilities of different units within the organization.
1760640	1763640	And then there is the problem of finding capabilities.
1763640	1768640	So if you work for Google and you want to know whether there's someone in Google
1768640	1772640	who has some capability that you need to exploit,
1772640	1774640	then you have to Google Google.
1774640	1780640	So people who work for Google Google Google in order to find the people they need.
1780640	1784640	And similarly, if you work for the NIH or for any kind of large organization
1784640	1792640	where you need people to approve grants or vet decisions,
1792640	1795640	then you need to find people in your organization
1795640	1798640	who have certain combinations of capabilities.
1798640	1804640	And it's very difficult to collect and keep up-to-date data about those things.
1806640	1809640	And there are whole disciplines of capabilities engineering,
1809640	1811640	which are part of systems engineering.
1811640	1818640	All right, now very quickly, because Clint is going to talk about this in greater detail,
1818640	1821640	language is a capability.
1821640	1827640	In fact, that's the definition of language which I want to promote.
1827640	1835640	A language is, so this is a question which we could discuss maybe and maybe Clint resolves it,
1836640	1840640	it's either a capability or it's an aggregate of capabilities.
1840640	1845640	And so language is defined as a special kind of competence.
1845640	1854640	But where competence in the Chomsky world is seen as a set of universal innate rules,
1854640	1859640	universal grammar, we're viewing competence as a matter of capabilities
1859640	1865640	which are realized by people speaking and reading and writing and so forth.
1865640	1867640	And some of those are innate.
1867640	1875640	Some of the features exemplified when we speak or write or read are innate.
1875640	1879640	But no language is innate.
1879640	1883640	Not even English is innate.
1883640	1885640	All languages have to be learned.
1886640	1891640	But we have the innate capability to learn some language.
1891640	1897640	But for that, we need parents and kin and dictionaries and teachers and so forth.
1897640	1901640	There's a category error in the writing part.
1901640	1902640	Because?
1902640	1908640	Because in the socialization part, societal norms, they cannot be at the same level as peers.
1908640	1911640	Yeah, you're right, that's not my picture.
1912640	1916640	So a definition of language, it's simple.
1916640	1921640	A language is an aggregate of capabilities of its users.
1921640	1923640	Now there are problems with this definition.
1923640	1926640	First of all, it's circular.
1926640	1930640	But I believe that this is a harmless circularity.
1930640	1935640	And what we have actually is something like a triple of terms,
1935640	1940640	each of which can only be defined by reference to the others.
1940640	1944640	And which triple we choose to take as primitive,
1944640	1947640	we're going to end up with circularity anyway.
1947640	1954640	So we take the capability term in the triple as primitive,
1954640	1957640	and we get the others for free as it were.
1957640	1965640	And because we have an independent definition of capability, the definition still works.
1965640	1971640	So I can give you other examples where this same circularity feature is present also
1971640	1974640	where it proves to be perfectly harmless.
1974640	1976640	Topology is a good example.
1976640	1981640	All right, now in order for an aggregate of linguistic dispositions,
1981640	1985640	which we call English or Italian or Chinese,
1985640	1988640	to exist and to be maintained in existence,
1988640	1992640	there have to be very, very complicated mechanisms.
1993640	1999640	Mothers and schools and so forth to keep the aggregate of capabilities
1999640	2003640	going from generation to generation.
2003640	2007640	All right, a language is an aggregate of capabilities of its users.
2007640	2012640	Now one nice feature of this definition is that we can define very easily
2012640	2014640	what a dialect is.
2014640	2017640	It's a sub-aggregate.
2017640	2023640	So in other words, it's the aggregate of capabilities or competencies
2023640	2026640	to speak the relevant language in a subset of people,
2026640	2032640	almost certainly within certain contexts where they speak the specific form of the language,
2032640	2035640	which is their dialect, rather than the more generic form,
2035640	2037640	which their parents speak.
2037640	2040640	So this is a map of Great Britain,
2040640	2045640	and this is Manchester, which is roughly where I come from.
2046640	2050640	And in Manchester there are lots of dialects,
2050640	2054640	which are divided geographically in this way.
2054640	2060640	I come from the rough, well, rough broad area of the northwest,
2060640	2063640	not from the posh area.
2063640	2067640	And what this shows, well, this is a, the English language in general
2067640	2069640	is an instance of the type language,
2069640	2074640	which is a sub-class of the type aggregate of dispositions,
2074640	2079640	which is a sub-class of the type disposition in BFO terms.
2079640	2085640	And then Manchester dialect is an instance of the type dialect.
2085640	2088640	Actually, it's a collection of dialects, but we'll come to that.
2088640	2092640	It's an instance of the type dialect, which is a part of language.
2092640	2098640	So every dialect is a part of some language,
2098640	2102640	in a very, very simple, myriological sense.
2103640	2106640	And that's because one aggregate of dispositions
2106640	2109640	is part of another aggregate of dispositions.
2109640	2113640	And these aggregates of linguistic dispositions
2113640	2116640	go hand-in-hand very often with aggregates
2116640	2119640	of non-linguistic dispositions to behave in certain ways,
2119640	2124640	for instance, to beat people up if they come from Liverpool.
2124640	2126640	So...
2126640	2128640	I'm sure you never did that.
2128640	2130640	No.
2130640	2134640	All right, now Sol gets many of these things right.
2134640	2137640	So this is a long quotation from Sol.
2137640	2141640	And the point is that my ability to speak English
2141640	2144640	is based in the physics of my brain
2144640	2147640	and of my diaphragm and of all the other organs
2147640	2150640	which are involved in producing speech.
2153640	2155640	Which are pictured there.
2155640	2158640	All right, and now all of this is kept going,
2159640	2162640	not only if there are people teaching each new generation,
2162640	2165640	but also if people are correcting and enforcing rules.
2165640	2167640	Not necessarily rules of good grammar.
2167640	2170640	They could be enforcing rules of bad grammar
2170640	2176640	because that's what happens with certain kinds of dialects.
2176640	2180640	The dialects are there to protect the group.
2182640	2186640	All right, so these are specifically human capabilities.
2188640	2190640	Enforcing rules and so forth.
2190640	2195640	Teaching, managing, guiding, appointing.
2195640	2198640	Ah, we don't need that and that's the end.
2198640	2202640	All right, so how am I doing?
2202640	2205640	I'm actually, we're back on time.
2205640	2207640	Believe it or not.
2209640	2212640	So we have time, I guess, for a few questions,
2212640	2215640	but we'll move to Clint very quickly.
2216640	2220640	I just had a question about the barrier of capabilities.
2220640	2224640	So when you talk about parts of my body having capability
2224640	2227640	and then I have that capability.
2227640	2229640	Parts of your body have functions
2229640	2232640	and therefore you have the corresponding capability.
2232640	2233640	Okay, okay.
2233640	2235640	That resolves it.
2235640	2237640	I was wondering about the migration
2237640	2241640	and not, SDC's not being migratable.
2242640	2245640	Like if I donate my kidney to Matt.
2245640	2246640	Yes, good.
2246640	2249640	That's a good starting question.
2249640	2257640	So if you donate your kidney to Matt,
2257640	2261640	then the kidney in Matt still has the function
2261640	2266640	of cleansing the liquids in your body.
2266640	2268640	But they have now the capability
2268640	2270640	of cleansing the liquids in Matt's body.
2270640	2272640	Matt's body, but they don't have the function
2272640	2276640	of cleansing the liquids in Matt's body.
2276640	2278640	It's the selected...
2290640	2295640	So the design would take care of the case that was just right.
2295640	2297640	I don't think that the kidney evolves
2297640	2299640	when it's shifted from one body to another.
2304640	2306640	I don't think we need to do that.
2306640	2309640	We can use the design for the grown kidney in the lab,
2309640	2311640	but I don't see why we need it.
2313640	2314640	It doesn't have...
2314640	2318640	It still has the function of cleansing blood in his body,
2318640	2322640	but it has now the capability of cleansing liquids in...
2323640	2324640	And the function too.
2324640	2326640	And the function too, I agree.
2326640	2327640	The capability...
2327640	2328640	It's not...
2328640	2331640	No, this is the etiological theory.
2331640	2334640	The function or the capability of an entity
2334640	2338640	depends on where it comes from.
2338640	2339640	So...
2341640	2343640	Anyway, we can...
2343640	2346640	I have an issue with the definition of capability
2346640	2348640	and the word interest.
2348640	2351640	So what you're saying is that capability
2351640	2355640	can only be assigned to an organism that hasn't...
2355640	2356640	No, no.
2356640	2360640	There has to be an organism or a group of organisms
2360640	2364640	which has an interest in the realization of a disposition
2364640	2366640	for it to be a capability.
2366640	2368640	But the disposition could be in another human being,
2368640	2372640	or it could be in a table or a planet or...
2374640	2376640	So there are lots of entities,
2376640	2378640	kinds of entities have capabilities,
2378640	2381640	but only the ones where we have some interest.
2382640	2388640	Capability is an interest-dependent notion,
2388640	2389640	which is...
2389640	2394640	This is not that of the organisms that are...
2394640	2396640	We ask humans, I guess.
2396640	2399640	Well, no, the rats and mice have interests
2399640	2401640	in the functioning of their parts too,
2401640	2403640	so they have capabilities.
2403640	2405640	It's not just humans.
2405640	2407640	Tables don't have an interest.
2408640	2411640	No, tables don't have an interest.
2415640	2416640	Any more?
2417640	2419640	Okay, so Clint...
