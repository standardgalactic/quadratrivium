Checking Ontolog Forum/Ontology Design Patterns by Gary Berg-Cross and Cogan Shimazu.txt
1. The workshop on ontology design patterns (WOP) is an annual event where researchers and practitioners discuss ontologies, their design, and reusable patterns in knowledge representation.

2. Chris, a co-organizer of the last WOP, mentioned that one of the patterns discussed was the design of scientific taxonomies. He highlighted that ontology design patterns can be specific to certain knowledge representation languages, unlike software design patterns which are language-agnostic.

3. There is no standardized way of reporting or reusing ontology design patterns. Different proposals exist, and one such proposal includes a 10-step or 12-step process for documenting use cases and potential reuse scenarios. However, these steps are not universally adopted.

4. The MODL repository is a curated collection of ontologies and ontology design patterns (ODPs), which serves as a resource for the community.

5. Stuart Snyder, also known as Call Hammer, has been involved with practical development using ontology design patterns and can provide insights into methods used in their application. His transition from IBM to Google may have provided him with a broader perspective on their use.

6. The session concluded with an invitation for everyone to join again next week, where more discussions about ontology design patterns, reusability, and practical applications can be expected. Attendees were encouraged to spread the word and invite colleagues or friends interested in these topics.
