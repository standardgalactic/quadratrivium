4
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:40,000
In 1980, brothers Doug and Gary Carlson founded their own computer software company named

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,040
Broaderbund. The Carlson brothers led Broaderbund to develop many popular titles, including

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:53,520
Choplifter, Gumball, Loadrunner, Karateca, and the Print Shop. By 1983, Broaderbund supported

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,560
a staff of over 40 people and sold millions of dollars worth of software annually. Despite

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,200
the stable business model, the Carlson brothers were nervous about one of their upcoming titles,

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,280
a new geography-based game named Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego. Lacking the confidence for a

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,560
standalone release, the brothers opted to release the game alongside a World Almanac. Despite the

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,240
hesitation, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego was a smash hit, immediately becoming the company's

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,040
most popular title. While computer enthusiasts were impressed by the game's four-color graphics

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
and innovative menu system, casual gamers were captivated by the globetrotting cat-and-mouse

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,680
gameplay and mix of trivia and humor. The game saw players pursuing the notorious thief Carmen

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,680
Sandiego and her gang of crooks throughout various countries and landmarks. Parents and teachers saw

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,920
its value as a teaching tool, and the software was purchased for computer labs throughout the

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,760
United States. By 1989, Carmen Sandiego was a budding franchise with the original game

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,680
spawning four sequels. Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego, Where in Europe is Carmen Sandiego,

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,640
Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego, and Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego.

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,520
The Carmen Sandiego franchise was soon a significant portion of Broderbund's 45 million

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,560
dollars in annual sales. The company had created an iconic character, and it was not long until

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,520
they looked into ways to expand the brand. Broderbund considered taking Carmen Sandiego from the

23
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,400
computer screen to the television screen. One potential partner was Walt Disney Television.

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,040
Producers from Disney had considered creating a Carmen Sandiego show for Disney Channel. This

25
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,280
would not come to fruition, and Broderbund continued their search. Around this time,

26
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,920
the company would receive a valuable piece of advice from a producer named Howard Blumenthal.

27
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,320
Blumenthal had worked on shows for MTV and Nickelodeon, and when Broderbund asked him to

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,280
consult on the development of a Carmen Sandiego series, he suggested an interesting strategy.

29
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,360
Blumenthal did not believe that licensing the show was where the money was. Rather,

30
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,520
the value of the television venture was national promotion of the Carmen Sandiego

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,480
software. Blumenthal recommended that Broderbund sell the television rights to Carmen Sandiego

32
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,600
to a public broadcasting service station, entrusting PBS to create a successful program

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,240
and deliver it to their large audience. The price that Blumenthal advised Broderbund to

34
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,600
sell the rights for? One dollar. By giving away the rights, the show was more likely to be produced

35
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,560
by PBS. Blumenthal left Broderbund with the advice and went to work on other shows. It would

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,360
take another few years, but Broderbund would eventually take his advice. Given the educational

37
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,840
focus of PBS children's shows, Broderbund would emphasize the geography of the Carmen

38
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,000
Sandiego series. The importance of the subject matter was highlighted by the release of a

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,720
National Geographic Survey that found that one in four Americans could not locate the Pacific

40
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,320
Ocean on a map, with a public need for geography education and a cheap, semi-recognizable property

41
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:50,160
of which to base a show. Two PBS stations, WQED Pittsburgh and WGBH Boston, agreed to co-produce

42
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,760
a pilot for a Carmen Sandiego television series. Broderbund opted to allow PBS to use the Carmen

43
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Sandiego name and concept for free, $1 less than Blumenthal had suggested. Broderbund would again

44
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,640
reach out to Blumenthal for his help on the series, and he would join the project as a producer.

45
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,200
PBS ordered 65 episodes of the show, with a total budget of around $3.5 million. The Carmen

46
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,840
Sandiego name, character, and subject matter would not be the only elements taken from the

47
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,040
computer software. The game aspect would be adapted as well, with the PBS show utilizing a

48
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,480
game show format with adolescent contestants. The show's pilot episodes were shot at WQED's

49
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,040
studios in Pittsburgh. It was immediately clear to the team that the show needed work. In the

50
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,760
original pilots, the geography aspect of the game was educational, but it lacked the energy

51
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,320
necessary to attract children. Blumenthal knew that the children of the early 1990s

52
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,280
responded to quick, colorful content, like the shows found on MTV and Nickelodeon.

53
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,000
After the lackluster pilot episodes, Blumenthal knew that he needed to inject more energy into

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,720
the production, and in order to do this, he went straight to the source. Blumenthal personally

55
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,680
interviewed over 900 kids to acquire a sense of what they would like to see in a show. The kids

56
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,720
told him exactly what they wanted, adventure, silly characters, comedy, cool prizes, animation,

57
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,600
and music. These elements were the exact energy the show was lacking. In order to craft these into

58
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,720
a cohesive show, Blumenthal liked the idea of a 40s noir parody, integrating the genre

59
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,800
throughout the first script for the game show. The format would feature three young contestants

60
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,240
who would be classified as rookie detectives, assigned to hunt down Carmen Sandiego and her gang.

61
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,400
They would report to the chief, the head of ACME CrimeNet, as well as the host,

62
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,640
ACME's special agent in charge of training new recruits. With the new roles to fill,

63
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,120
the crew began casting for the series, and the production was moved from Pittsburgh to New York.

64
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,280
The show would find a new home at Chelsea Studios, where it would have plenty of room for a new,

65
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,320
elaborate, interconnected set that featured CrimeNet headquarters, the chief's office,

66
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,640
a city street, various international terminals, a giant floor map, and a studio audience of 200

67
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,520
kids. Greg Lee, a children's game show veteran that had worked as a contestant coordinator on

68
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,720
Nickelodeon's Double Dare and as a co-host on Total Panic, was cast as the show's host.

69
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,360
For the role of chief, Blumenthal fought to cast film and theater actress Lynn Thigpen,

70
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,000
as he had imagined her for the role when he conceived it. However, Thigpen repeatedly turned

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,240
down the opportunity due to the show's intense production schedule. As the production planned

72
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,280
on shooting the show's 65 episodes in just three months, Blumenthal auditioned hundreds of actors

73
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,080
for the role of chief, but it was clear to both him and Greg Lee that Thigpen was the best person

74
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,240
for the job. The two met with the actress over brunch and were able to convince her that she

75
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,040
was perfect for the part. Thigpen agreed to play chief in the game show. The show was coming together

76
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,200
quickly, but Blumenthal was still needing to integrate music into the show. He researched

77
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,080
different musical styles, and he specifically wanted to integrate rap music into the program.

78
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,640
It was during this investigation that Blumenthal would watch a laser disc of Spike Lee and company

79
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Dewitt Acapella with his family. The PBS documentary, directed by Spike Lee, was focused on Acapella

80
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:04,000
music, and it featured a small band of singers named Acapella, singing an original song, Zombie

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:14,960
Jamboree. Blumenthal's wife suggested that he should use Acapella's music for the Carmen

82
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:26,000
San Diego show, and he took her suggestion. Acapella's music would become an integral

83
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,600
part of the show's energy. The singers, Sean Altman, Scott Leonard, Elliott Kerman, and Barry

84
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,520
Carl also pulled double duty as supporting cast to Greg in many sketches.

85
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Now that's a clue, ladies and gentlemen. Acapella!

86
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,280
PBS assigned a portion of the show's budget for animated segments, so Blumenthal decided to

87
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,560
represent Carmen and her crew of criminals as 2D animations created on a Macintosh computer.

88
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,800
This approach was groundbreaking for the time, and logistically challenging since there was no

89
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,440
easy way to digitize the drawings. The workaround was sending the drawings through a fax machine

90
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,320
and then converting them for use on the computer. The often crude drawings of Carmen and her gang,

91
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,600
the group preferred to as vile, were weird, wacky, and a large source of the show's humor.

92
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,760
Criminal mastermind Carmen San Diego retained her appearance from the computer game,

93
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,480
with her trademark trench coat and radora. Many original criminals were created for the show,

94
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:40,960
including the Contessa, Patty Larsonie, Robo Crook, Top Grunge, Vic the Slick,

95
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,840
Eartha Brute, and the Double Trouble Twins. Each episode would feature a different crook,

96
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,320
and the Acme Crime Network recruits pursued Carmen San Diego in the finale of each show.

97
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,480
The digitally animated scenes also served to retain the feel of the computer games.

98
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,640
The final piece of the casting puzzle was the contestants. For every episode,

99
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,200
three gumshoes joined Acme Crime Network as new recruits. Lumenthal and the producer sought out

100
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,240
kids between the ages of 9 and 14, who could handle the pressures of a television game show.

101
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,440
They also made sure that the children had a strong knowledge of geography,

102
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,920
having them take a written exam before being selected. Every episode began with the chief

103
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
shouting over the rowdy child audience.

104
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:41,360
The chief then introduced the three contestants and the title of the episode's case,

105
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,240
usually a pun on a common phrase. Once in the Acme offices, Greg entered,

106
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,080
and after a very brief introduction began the game. The chief communicated with

107
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,800
contestants primarily via a television that Greg would tune. Cases for each episode involved

108
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,960
different members of Carmen's gang stealing important cultural works and landmarks.

109
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,960
In the first season, this included the Mona Lisa, the Great Wall of China,

110
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,160
the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and even Abraham Lincoln's nose from Mount Rushmore.

111
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,800
The chief showed footage that revealed the crooks' history and the item that was stolen,

112
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,880
before ordering the gumshoes to recover the stolen item, arrest the criminal,

113
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,480
and find Carmen San Diego.

114
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,480
Greg then explained the rules of the round,

115
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,560
and the chief returned briefly to provide a clue.

116
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,080
The three contestants were asked to answer a multiple-choice map-based question,

117
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,280
and were awarded or deducted points based on their answers.

118
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,840
Points on the show were referred to as Crime Box.

119
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,880
The questions in the first round were sandwiched between player vios.

120
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,400
Short sketches,

121
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,360
Oh my. Oh my. That was great. You're good.

122
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,400
Thank you. Yeah.

123
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,440
She should see my hamlet.

124
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,320
I'd love to see it.

125
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,160
Songs,

126
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,280
and guest agents.

127
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,640
I don't have much time, so listen carefully. Brush up on your German.

128
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,200
Most of these segments led into the next question.

129
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,040
Halfway through the match, a frustrated chief would call Greg into her office,

130
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,800
upset that he and the recruits had yet to capture the crook or San Diego.

131
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,720
To motivate the detectives, she offered a free trip to anywhere in the contiguous

132
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,520
United States, which was the show's grand prize.

133
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,600
Find Carmen, and I will send you anywhere in the whole country.

134
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,440
Chief, we can't do that.

135
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:57,840
Why not?

136
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,720
Oh. Anywhere in the lower 48 states.

137
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,440
Hey.

138
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,640
Hey, it's still a heck of a deal.

139
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,280
Heck of a deal.

140
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,160
Once back at the Acme office,

141
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Greg played a recording of a tapped phone call between Carmen and the crook of the day.

142
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,040
The call would contain clues to the crook's next destination,

143
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,920
and the trio detectives would determine where to travel to next.

144
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,720
Head for a South American country with two capital cities.

145
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,960
Take the towers to the legal capital.

146
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,640
Good thinking, Carmen.

147
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,280
Acme won't figure us for anything legal.

148
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,520
The final question of the first round displayed a map with three locations.

149
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,960
Before revealing the question,

150
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,000
the contestants could wager between zero and 50 crime bucks

151
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,480
that they could answer the question correctly when asked.

152
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,640
So take a look at this map and think about it.

153
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:58,320
At the end of the round,

154
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,280
the lowest-scoring gumshoe was eliminated from the competition,

155
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,120
but they were not sent home empty-handed.

156
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,920
The eliminated contestant was awarded an Acme travel kit,

157
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,440
including a World Atlas,

158
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,560
a year subscription to National Geographic World Magazine,

159
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,560
an official Carmen San Diego watch, and other Carmen swag.

160
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,760
The show's second round began with the chief debriefing the remaining detectives

161
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,560
on a specific location that the crook was traveling to.

162
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,640
She presented historical, geographical, and cultural information

163
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,360
about the destination as a slide presentation.

164
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,080
Greg and the recruits arrived at the terminal of the location,

165
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,360
and a memory-style game featuring a large board was played.

166
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,760
Contestants alternated revealing portions of the board

167
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,800
in pursuit of the loot, the warrant, and the crook.

168
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:51,600
The first to find all three and put the crook in jail

169
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
advanced to the next and final round.

170
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,560
A runner-up prize was awarded to the loser of the second round,

171
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,480
which included the Acme travel kit,

172
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,320
along with the addition of a pocket translator and a world-band radio.

173
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,840
Before starting the final round,

174
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,760
the winning detective would write down their grand prize destination city for Greg.

175
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,280
The captured crooks called the new agent to inform them of Carmen's location,

176
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,240
narrowed down to either the United States, South America, Europe, Africa, or Asia.

177
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,320
And the chief rattled off a list of places Carmen may have traveled.

178
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,760
Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia, North Korea, Japan.

179
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,680
Greg then took the contestant to a giant map of the location.

180
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,640
The contestant had 45 seconds to race around the map,

181
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,960
placing light-up markers on the correct locations

182
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,760
as Greg rattled off clues followed by the location name.

183
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,000
If the contestant set the marker wrong,

184
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,920
they got a second chance before moving on.

185
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,120
If a contestant could place seven markers in the correct position before time was up,

186
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,360
they caught Carmen and won the grand prize.

187
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,960
The prize location chosen by the contestants was only revealed when they won the game.

188
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,720
And kids who didn't capture Carmen parted with a CD player and CDs from around the world,

189
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,280
including the acapella soundtrack to the show.

190
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,280
Win or lose, every episode ended with Greg and the contestant pointing to the camera

191
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,440
and yelling the show's signature sign-off.

192
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,880
Do it, Rockapella, triggering the band to perform Carmen's title theme.

193
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Production of the first season moved at a pace as frantic as the show itself.

194
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,240
The entire 65-episode season would be shot in just six weeks,

195
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,800
taping three to four episodes every workday.

196
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,080
Being a PBS show,

197
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,680
where in the world is Carmen San Diego aired without commercial interruptions,

198
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,000
resulting in 27-minute episodes.

199
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,760
For the first season, the cast and crew performed the episodes as if they were live.

200
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,880
The exception was the chief, whose interactions were limited to

201
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,960
clue-giving and skits with Greg.

202
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,080
Lynn Thigpen prerecorded the chief segments for each episode,

203
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,920
and the videos were intercut and shown on monitors to the contestants throughout the show.

204
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,720
The game itself evolved over the first season,

205
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,360
changing point values and dropping the three clues for each location in the final game.

206
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,480
Rockapella frequently had to create impromptu songs and parodies

207
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,640
mere minutes before the taping of segments.

208
00:16:52,640 --> 00:17:10,800
Viewers could hear the group's distinctive voice throughout the show,

209
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,360
including in the narration for round two's memory board.

210
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:32,160
The season wrapped on schedule in May of 1991,

211
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,480
and PBS was pleased with the product.

212
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,320
Where in the world is Carmen San Diego premiered on the afternoon of September 30th,

213
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,160
1991, on PBS stations throughout the United States.

214
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,120
That same night,

215
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,600
PBS broadcast back-to-back episodes of the new show in its primetime slot.

216
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,600
After this, the show aired Monday through Friday in the after-school block.

217
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,720
Children across the country became instant fans of the show.

218
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,520
The focus on high-energy fun paid off, and young viewers kept coming back for more.

219
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,160
The show also drew a diverse audience, and the show itself was focused on diversity,

220
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,280
both in its contestants and in its geography.

221
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,760
Executive producer Kate Taylor explained,

222
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,240
quote,

223
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,960
We did not want to have a show that was culturally insensitive

224
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,120
that focused too much on the Western world.

225
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,280
We didn't want a show that too narrowly defined what geography really is.

226
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,480
The show was renewed for a second 65 episodes season,

227
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,680
moving production to the Kauffman Astoria Studios in Queens,

228
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,440
the home of Sesame Street.

229
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,000
This was not the only change made between seasons.

230
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
In the early 1990s,

231
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,640
massive geopolitical changes were happening throughout the world,

232
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,640
and many maps and clues used during the first season were already out of date.

233
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,600
Episodes after season one included the disclaimer,

234
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,680
All geographic information was accurate as of the date this program was recorded.

235
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,760
As countries changed their names or borders,

236
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,080
the giant maps used on the show were updated,

237
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,560
often overnight for recording the next day.

238
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,960
The second season also expanded the grand prize

239
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,920
to allow children to travel to anywhere in North America,

240
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,400
rather than just the contiguous United States.

241
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,520
Blumenthal would also push for more silliness for the second season,

242
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,240
encouraging the staff to watch shows like Animaniacs

243
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,560
and Rocky and Bullwinkle for inspiration.

244
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,240
Greg Lee also joined the writing staff in addition to his hosting duties,

245
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,440
and the series built a world of recurring characters and gags,

246
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,480
frequently played by a Rockefeller member in some form.

247
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,120
The show expanded Carmen's Gang of Crooks in season two

248
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,760
to include the space alien, Nimoy,

249
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,000
and the superhero character, Wonder Rat.

250
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,240
Season two's first episode was the series' only double episode,

251
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,960
where the contestants were paired with celebrity teammates,

252
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,720
Mayim Bialik, Tatiana Ali, and Jeremy Miller.

253
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,760
Celebrities also supported the series throughout its run

254
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,480
by pre-recording clips as special agents of ACME,

255
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,240
presenting clues to the players.

256
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,840
Rhea Perlman, Sally Jessie Raphael, Walter Cronkite, Penn and Teller,

257
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,440
Zap and Turbo, X The Owl, and Henrietta Pussycat,

258
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,360
as performed by Mr. Rogers, and many more help deliver clues on the show.

259
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,520
In one case, Greg Lee's mother provided the information to surprise her son.

260
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,240
This alien came to town, and now we can't stop doing the tango.

261
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,960
This is corn country, son, and farm folks have to get up early.

262
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,000
Just because Fred Astaire was born in this state doesn't mean we all like dancing.

263
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,760
Get here quick, Greg. Our feet can't hold out much longer.

264
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,720
Can we please have a nice run of applause for the finest informant ever on this show?

265
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:44,640
The second season also introduced a new game element called the chase,

266
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,520
where contestants answered a quick progression of questions

267
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,760
leading to the crooks predicted destination.

268
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,960
In some cases, the chase was preceded by an actual chase

269
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,600
throughout the sets and audience before the questions were asked.

270
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:20,320
In the final episode of season two titled Gotta Get a Yeti,

271
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
the series had its only geographic layer,

272
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,200
causing the correct answer to be considered wrong and noted as such in the end credits.

273
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,080
The contestant, who had been eliminated in the first round,

274
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,320
was invited to come back in season three,

275
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,280
where he won the game and caught Carmen Sandiego in Asia.

276
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,240
And you should feel good. You came back the second time.

277
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,120
You did it. A few moments ago, you wrote down where you'd like to go.

278
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,360
If you caught Carmen Sandiego, you did it.

279
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,600
So that means you and a parent are going to Florida.

280
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,760
Season two of the show increased its audience size by 16%.

281
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:04,160
By the end of 1992, the show was broadcasting on 92% of the 331 PBS transmitters in the United States.

282
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,000
Approximately 5.4 million viewers watched at least once per week.

283
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,560
The show won a Peabody Award, as well as a Daytime Emmy for Art Direction and Set Design.

284
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,400
Broderbund continued its success with its line of Carmen Sandiego software,

285
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,960
releasing a deluxe version of the original game,

286
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,360
along with officially licensed board games.

287
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,840
Another Carmen Sandiego series was developed,

288
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,120
this time an animated serial produced by DIC Animation,

289
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,840
called Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego?

290
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,760
This Saturday morning cartoon premiered on Fox's Fox Kids Network block

291
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,880
in 1994.

292
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,680
The series followed ACME in their pursuit of Carmen Sandiego and Vile,

293
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,920
and the animation incorporated elements from both the original game and the game show.

294
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,600
The series would last for four seasons, for a total of 40 episodes,

295
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,480
with the final episode premiering in 1999.

296
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,880
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego was renewed for a third season on PBS.

297
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,040
PBS created a new prize program for season three to reward the viewers at home.

298
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,440
The chief instructed kids to write down the loot and location of each episode on a postcard.

299
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,160
After listing four episodes of info, the kids mailed in their postcard to ACME CrimeNet.

300
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
If correct, they entered into a drawing,

301
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,080
and five kids each day won a Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego t-shirt.

302
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,360
International versions of the show were also developed for broadcast,

303
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,480
mimicking the show's style and friendly chief and Greg relationship.

304
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,960
Season three of Carmen Sandiego would also consist of 64 episodes,

305
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,080
and it would air from September to December 1993.

306
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,240
The show would be renewed for a fourth and fifth season of 50 episodes each,

307
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,520
airing in 1994 and 1995 respectively.

308
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,240
These seasons brought more recurring characters, including Vile criminal Sarah Nade,

309
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,080
and many alter egos for Greg Lee, including ACME man,

310
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,000
Greg's retired detective father, Gus Lee, and Phil the Barber.

311
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,240
In the last taped episode of season five,

312
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,520
Phil the Barber surprised the audience and Rockefeller by cutting off

313
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,320
Sean Altman's signature braided hair at the end of the show.

314
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,840
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego was a great success for PBS, and the team that made it.

315
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,520
But after five seasons, some believed it would be easier to secure funding

316
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,160
for a new show rather than an existing one.

317
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,680
Thus, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego's final episode aired on December 22, 1995.

318
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,760
But a spin-off game show, Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego,

319
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,320
would air starting in October less than a year later.

320
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,640
Lynn Thigpen reprised her role as chief in the new series,

321
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,400
but Greg Lee was replaced by Kevin Shinnick as the host of the new show,

322
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,760
Where in Time was retooled significantly from the original game show,

323
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,120
instead taking place in a science fiction setting and focusing on world history rather than geography.

324
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,440
Also, the Vile characters were portrayed by actors instead of represented by animation.

325
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:29,280
The new show's animation budget was instead spent on computer-generated 3D effects.

326
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,200
Rockefeller was no longer featured, and a new theme song was created for the show,

327
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,160
performed by the show's new musical troupe, The Engine Crew.

328
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,840
Engine's hot, our friend's modern leader will help us give leader and bring back the loot

329
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,160
to each rightful place in time. Tell me where in time is Carmen Sandiego?

330
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,520
Stop that crime and solve this mystery.

331
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,400
These are just a few of the many differences between the two shows.

332
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,840
It's 1991. How many dollars are spent on advertising in the U.S.?

333
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,560
37 billion or 37 trillion?

334
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,520
37 billion!

335
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,320
Energize the capture crystal! Now take it, Gloria!

336
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,320
And run and place it in the Quinoa lost chamber to capture Carmen Sandiego!

337
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:35,680
Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego would last for two seasons, for a total of 115 episodes.

338
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,480
Since the conclusion of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego,

339
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,680
the titular character has continued her cultural relevancy through consistent video game releases.

340
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Carmen Sandiego was also given a fourth television series on Netflix,

341
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,720
which premiered in 2019 and ran for four seasons.

342
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,640
This animated show incorporated elements from the original 90s animation,

343
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,320
the computer games, and of course, the hit PBS game show.

344
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,360
Yeah!

345
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,360
Over the decades, geographical changes have made much of the trivia featured on

346
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,880
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego outdated and incorrect.

347
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,600
Fans can find VHS rips of the series on YouTube,

348
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,920
but there have been no official releases of the show,

349
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,440
and likely won't be due to the now factual inaccuracies.

350
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,320
The game show is well remembered for its elaborate theming,

351
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,760
high energy, production value, and talented cast.

352
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,280
It is considered not only one of PBS's greatest children shows,

353
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,160
but one of the greatest game shows created for children.

354
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,760
Impressive considering it aired in the golden age of children's game shows.

355
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,360
Above all, the show had a very specific goal of educating children on geography,

356
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,760
a goal that it achieved and surpassed, resulting in not just education,

357
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,800
but celebration of the world and its cultures.

358
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,800
All of this wrapped inside a humorous, non-stop detective adventure.

359
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,960
It is no wonder that the show was a hit,

360
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,120
and it is obvious why millions of gumshoes tuned in every day to find out

361
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,760
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

362
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,400
All geographic information was accurate as of the date this program was recorded.

363
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,400
It is also known as the World's Greatest Game Show.
