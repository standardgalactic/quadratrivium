00:30.960 --> 00:40.000
In 1980, brothers Doug and Gary Carlson founded their own computer software company named

00:40.000 --> 00:45.040
Broaderbund. The Carlson brothers led Broaderbund to develop many popular titles, including

00:45.040 --> 00:53.520
Choplifter, Gumball, Loadrunner, Karateca, and the Print Shop. By 1983, Broaderbund supported

00:53.520 --> 00:58.560
a staff of over 40 people and sold millions of dollars worth of software annually. Despite

00:58.560 --> 01:03.200
the stable business model, the Carlson brothers were nervous about one of their upcoming titles,

01:03.200 --> 01:09.280
a new geography-based game named Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego. Lacking the confidence for a

01:09.280 --> 01:14.560
standalone release, the brothers opted to release the game alongside a World Almanac. Despite the

01:14.560 --> 01:20.240
hesitation, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego was a smash hit, immediately becoming the company's

01:20.240 --> 01:25.040
most popular title. While computer enthusiasts were impressed by the game's four-color graphics

01:25.040 --> 01:30.000
and innovative menu system, casual gamers were captivated by the globetrotting cat-and-mouse

01:30.000 --> 01:35.680
gameplay and mix of trivia and humor. The game saw players pursuing the notorious thief Carmen

01:35.680 --> 01:41.680
Sandiego and her gang of crooks throughout various countries and landmarks. Parents and teachers saw

01:41.680 --> 01:45.920
its value as a teaching tool, and the software was purchased for computer labs throughout the

01:45.920 --> 01:51.760
United States. By 1989, Carmen Sandiego was a budding franchise with the original game

01:51.760 --> 01:57.680
spawning four sequels. Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego, Where in Europe is Carmen Sandiego,

01:57.680 --> 02:02.640
Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego, and Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego.

02:02.640 --> 02:07.520
The Carmen Sandiego franchise was soon a significant portion of Broderbund's 45 million

02:07.520 --> 02:12.560
dollars in annual sales. The company had created an iconic character, and it was not long until

02:12.560 --> 02:17.520
they looked into ways to expand the brand. Broderbund considered taking Carmen Sandiego from the

02:17.600 --> 02:22.400
computer screen to the television screen. One potential partner was Walt Disney Television.

02:22.400 --> 02:27.040
Producers from Disney had considered creating a Carmen Sandiego show for Disney Channel. This

02:27.040 --> 02:31.280
would not come to fruition, and Broderbund continued their search. Around this time,

02:31.280 --> 02:35.920
the company would receive a valuable piece of advice from a producer named Howard Blumenthal.

02:35.920 --> 02:40.320
Blumenthal had worked on shows for MTV and Nickelodeon, and when Broderbund asked him to

02:40.320 --> 02:45.280
consult on the development of a Carmen Sandiego series, he suggested an interesting strategy.

02:45.280 --> 02:49.360
Blumenthal did not believe that licensing the show was where the money was. Rather,

02:49.360 --> 02:53.520
the value of the television venture was national promotion of the Carmen Sandiego

02:53.520 --> 02:58.480
software. Blumenthal recommended that Broderbund sell the television rights to Carmen Sandiego

02:58.480 --> 03:03.600
to a public broadcasting service station, entrusting PBS to create a successful program

03:03.600 --> 03:08.240
and deliver it to their large audience. The price that Blumenthal advised Broderbund to

03:08.240 --> 03:13.600
sell the rights for? One dollar. By giving away the rights, the show was more likely to be produced

03:13.600 --> 03:18.560
by PBS. Blumenthal left Broderbund with the advice and went to work on other shows. It would

03:18.560 --> 03:23.360
take another few years, but Broderbund would eventually take his advice. Given the educational

03:23.360 --> 03:27.840
focus of PBS children's shows, Broderbund would emphasize the geography of the Carmen

03:27.840 --> 03:32.000
Sandiego series. The importance of the subject matter was highlighted by the release of a

03:32.000 --> 03:36.720
National Geographic Survey that found that one in four Americans could not locate the Pacific

03:36.720 --> 03:42.320
Ocean on a map, with a public need for geography education and a cheap, semi-recognizable property

03:42.320 --> 03:50.160
of which to base a show. Two PBS stations, WQED Pittsburgh and WGBH Boston, agreed to co-produce

03:50.160 --> 03:55.760
a pilot for a Carmen Sandiego television series. Broderbund opted to allow PBS to use the Carmen

03:55.760 --> 04:01.760
Sandiego name and concept for free, $1 less than Blumenthal had suggested. Broderbund would again

04:01.760 --> 04:06.640
reach out to Blumenthal for his help on the series, and he would join the project as a producer.

04:06.640 --> 04:13.200
PBS ordered 65 episodes of the show, with a total budget of around $3.5 million. The Carmen

04:13.200 --> 04:17.840
Sandiego name, character, and subject matter would not be the only elements taken from the

04:17.840 --> 04:23.040
computer software. The game aspect would be adapted as well, with the PBS show utilizing a

04:23.040 --> 04:28.480
game show format with adolescent contestants. The show's pilot episodes were shot at WQED's

04:28.480 --> 04:33.040
studios in Pittsburgh. It was immediately clear to the team that the show needed work. In the

04:33.040 --> 04:37.760
original pilots, the geography aspect of the game was educational, but it lacked the energy

04:37.760 --> 04:42.320
necessary to attract children. Blumenthal knew that the children of the early 1990s

04:42.320 --> 04:47.280
responded to quick, colorful content, like the shows found on MTV and Nickelodeon.

04:47.280 --> 04:52.000
After the lackluster pilot episodes, Blumenthal knew that he needed to inject more energy into

04:52.000 --> 04:56.720
the production, and in order to do this, he went straight to the source. Blumenthal personally

04:56.720 --> 05:01.680
interviewed over 900 kids to acquire a sense of what they would like to see in a show. The kids

05:01.680 --> 05:08.720
told him exactly what they wanted, adventure, silly characters, comedy, cool prizes, animation,

05:08.720 --> 05:13.600
and music. These elements were the exact energy the show was lacking. In order to craft these into

05:13.600 --> 05:18.720
a cohesive show, Blumenthal liked the idea of a 40s noir parody, integrating the genre

05:18.720 --> 05:22.800
throughout the first script for the game show. The format would feature three young contestants

05:22.800 --> 05:28.240
who would be classified as rookie detectives, assigned to hunt down Carmen Sandiego and her gang.

05:28.240 --> 05:32.400
They would report to the chief, the head of ACME CrimeNet, as well as the host,

05:32.400 --> 05:36.640
ACME's special agent in charge of training new recruits. With the new roles to fill,

05:36.640 --> 05:41.120
the crew began casting for the series, and the production was moved from Pittsburgh to New York.

05:41.120 --> 05:45.280
The show would find a new home at Chelsea Studios, where it would have plenty of room for a new,

05:45.280 --> 05:50.320
elaborate, interconnected set that featured CrimeNet headquarters, the chief's office,

05:50.320 --> 05:56.640
a city street, various international terminals, a giant floor map, and a studio audience of 200

05:56.640 --> 06:01.520
kids. Greg Lee, a children's game show veteran that had worked as a contestant coordinator on

06:01.520 --> 06:06.720
Nickelodeon's Double Dare and as a co-host on Total Panic, was cast as the show's host.

06:06.720 --> 06:11.360
For the role of chief, Blumenthal fought to cast film and theater actress Lynn Thigpen,

06:11.360 --> 06:16.000
as he had imagined her for the role when he conceived it. However, Thigpen repeatedly turned

06:16.000 --> 06:20.240
down the opportunity due to the show's intense production schedule. As the production planned

06:20.240 --> 06:25.280
on shooting the show's 65 episodes in just three months, Blumenthal auditioned hundreds of actors

06:25.360 --> 06:30.080
for the role of chief, but it was clear to both him and Greg Lee that Thigpen was the best person

06:30.080 --> 06:34.240
for the job. The two met with the actress over brunch and were able to convince her that she

06:34.240 --> 06:39.040
was perfect for the part. Thigpen agreed to play chief in the game show. The show was coming together

06:39.040 --> 06:43.200
quickly, but Blumenthal was still needing to integrate music into the show. He researched

06:43.200 --> 06:48.080
different musical styles, and he specifically wanted to integrate rap music into the program.

06:48.080 --> 06:52.640
It was during this investigation that Blumenthal would watch a laser disc of Spike Lee and company

06:52.640 --> 06:58.640
Dewitt Acapella with his family. The PBS documentary, directed by Spike Lee, was focused on Acapella

06:58.640 --> 07:04.000
music, and it featured a small band of singers named Acapella, singing an original song, Zombie

07:04.000 --> 07:14.960
Jamboree. Blumenthal's wife suggested that he should use Acapella's music for the Carmen

07:14.960 --> 07:26.000
San Diego show, and he took her suggestion. Acapella's music would become an integral

07:26.000 --> 07:31.600
part of the show's energy. The singers, Sean Altman, Scott Leonard, Elliott Kerman, and Barry

07:31.600 --> 07:35.520
Carl also pulled double duty as supporting cast to Greg in many sketches.

07:35.520 --> 07:55.520
Now that's a clue, ladies and gentlemen. Acapella!

07:56.560 --> 08:01.280
PBS assigned a portion of the show's budget for animated segments, so Blumenthal decided to

08:01.280 --> 08:06.560
represent Carmen and her crew of criminals as 2D animations created on a Macintosh computer.

08:06.560 --> 08:10.800
This approach was groundbreaking for the time, and logistically challenging since there was no

08:10.800 --> 08:15.440
easy way to digitize the drawings. The workaround was sending the drawings through a fax machine

08:15.440 --> 08:20.320
and then converting them for use on the computer. The often crude drawings of Carmen and her gang,

08:20.320 --> 08:25.600
the group preferred to as vile, were weird, wacky, and a large source of the show's humor.

08:25.600 --> 08:29.760
Criminal mastermind Carmen San Diego retained her appearance from the computer game,

08:29.760 --> 08:34.480
with her trademark trench coat and radora. Many original criminals were created for the show,

08:34.480 --> 08:40.960
including the Contessa, Patty Larsonie, Robo Crook, Top Grunge, Vic the Slick,

08:40.960 --> 08:45.840
Eartha Brute, and the Double Trouble Twins. Each episode would feature a different crook,

08:45.840 --> 08:50.320
and the Acme Crime Network recruits pursued Carmen San Diego in the finale of each show.

08:50.320 --> 08:54.480
The digitally animated scenes also served to retain the feel of the computer games.

08:54.480 --> 08:58.640
The final piece of the casting puzzle was the contestants. For every episode,

08:58.720 --> 09:03.200
three gumshoes joined Acme Crime Network as new recruits. Lumenthal and the producer sought out

09:03.200 --> 09:08.240
kids between the ages of 9 and 14, who could handle the pressures of a television game show.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.440
They also made sure that the children had a strong knowledge of geography,

09:11.440 --> 09:15.920
having them take a written exam before being selected. Every episode began with the chief

09:15.920 --> 09:17.920
shouting over the rowdy child audience.

09:29.520 --> 09:41.360
The chief then introduced the three contestants and the title of the episode's case,

09:41.360 --> 09:46.240
usually a pun on a common phrase. Once in the Acme offices, Greg entered,

09:46.240 --> 09:50.080
and after a very brief introduction began the game. The chief communicated with

09:50.080 --> 09:54.800
contestants primarily via a television that Greg would tune. Cases for each episode involved

09:54.800 --> 09:58.960
different members of Carmen's gang stealing important cultural works and landmarks.

09:58.960 --> 10:02.960
In the first season, this included the Mona Lisa, the Great Wall of China,

10:03.600 --> 10:08.160
the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and even Abraham Lincoln's nose from Mount Rushmore.

10:08.960 --> 10:12.800
The chief showed footage that revealed the crooks' history and the item that was stolen,

10:12.800 --> 10:16.880
before ordering the gumshoes to recover the stolen item, arrest the criminal,

10:16.880 --> 10:18.480
and find Carmen San Diego.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.480
Greg then explained the rules of the round,

10:28.480 --> 10:30.560
and the chief returned briefly to provide a clue.

10:48.240 --> 10:52.080
The three contestants were asked to answer a multiple-choice map-based question,

10:52.160 --> 10:55.280
and were awarded or deducted points based on their answers.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.840
Points on the show were referred to as Crime Box.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.880
The questions in the first round were sandwiched between player vios.

11:05.680 --> 11:06.400
Short sketches,

11:07.200 --> 11:11.360
Oh my. Oh my. That was great. You're good.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.400
Thank you. Yeah.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.440
She should see my hamlet.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.320
I'd love to see it.

11:15.680 --> 11:16.160
Songs,

11:28.320 --> 11:29.280
and guest agents.

11:29.280 --> 11:34.640
I don't have much time, so listen carefully. Brush up on your German.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.200
Most of these segments led into the next question.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.040
Halfway through the match, a frustrated chief would call Greg into her office,

11:41.040 --> 11:44.800
upset that he and the recruits had yet to capture the crook or San Diego.

11:44.800 --> 11:48.720
To motivate the detectives, she offered a free trip to anywhere in the contiguous

11:48.720 --> 11:51.520
United States, which was the show's grand prize.

11:51.520 --> 11:55.600
Find Carmen, and I will send you anywhere in the whole country.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.440
Chief, we can't do that.

11:57.440 --> 11:57.840
Why not?

11:59.040 --> 12:02.720
Oh. Anywhere in the lower 48 states.

12:02.720 --> 12:03.440
Hey.

12:03.440 --> 12:04.640
Hey, it's still a heck of a deal.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.280
Heck of a deal.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.160
Once back at the Acme office,

12:08.160 --> 12:12.160
Greg played a recording of a tapped phone call between Carmen and the crook of the day.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.040
The call would contain clues to the crook's next destination,

12:15.040 --> 12:17.920
and the trio detectives would determine where to travel to next.

12:18.640 --> 12:22.720
Head for a South American country with two capital cities.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.960
Take the towers to the legal capital.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.640
Good thinking, Carmen.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.280
Acme won't figure us for anything legal.

12:29.840 --> 12:33.520
The final question of the first round displayed a map with three locations.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.960
Before revealing the question,

12:34.960 --> 12:38.000
the contestants could wager between zero and 50 crime bucks

12:38.000 --> 12:40.480
that they could answer the question correctly when asked.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.640
So take a look at this map and think about it.

12:43.040 --> 12:58.320
At the end of the round,

12:58.320 --> 13:01.280
the lowest-scoring gumshoe was eliminated from the competition,

13:01.280 --> 13:03.120
but they were not sent home empty-handed.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.920
The eliminated contestant was awarded an Acme travel kit,

13:05.920 --> 13:07.440
including a World Atlas,

13:07.440 --> 13:10.560
a year subscription to National Geographic World Magazine,

13:10.560 --> 13:14.560
an official Carmen San Diego watch, and other Carmen swag.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.760
The show's second round began with the chief debriefing the remaining detectives

13:17.760 --> 13:20.560
on a specific location that the crook was traveling to.

13:20.560 --> 13:24.640
She presented historical, geographical, and cultural information

13:24.640 --> 13:27.360
about the destination as a slide presentation.

13:27.360 --> 13:30.080
Greg and the recruits arrived at the terminal of the location,

13:30.080 --> 13:33.360
and a memory-style game featuring a large board was played.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.760
Contestants alternated revealing portions of the board

13:35.760 --> 13:38.800
in pursuit of the loot, the warrant, and the crook.

13:41.520 --> 13:51.600
The first to find all three and put the crook in jail

13:51.600 --> 13:53.600
advanced to the next and final round.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.560
A runner-up prize was awarded to the loser of the second round,

13:56.560 --> 13:58.480
which included the Acme travel kit,

13:58.480 --> 14:02.320
along with the addition of a pocket translator and a world-band radio.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.840
Before starting the final round,

14:03.840 --> 14:07.760
the winning detective would write down their grand prize destination city for Greg.

14:07.760 --> 14:11.280
The captured crooks called the new agent to inform them of Carmen's location,

14:11.280 --> 14:16.240
narrowed down to either the United States, South America, Europe, Africa, or Asia.

14:21.280 --> 14:24.320
And the chief rattled off a list of places Carmen may have traveled.

14:24.880 --> 14:31.760
Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia, North Korea, Japan.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.680
Greg then took the contestant to a giant map of the location.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.640
The contestant had 45 seconds to race around the map,

14:42.640 --> 14:44.960
placing light-up markers on the correct locations

14:44.960 --> 14:47.760
as Greg rattled off clues followed by the location name.

14:54.880 --> 14:58.000
If the contestant set the marker wrong,

14:58.000 --> 14:59.920
they got a second chance before moving on.

15:11.120 --> 15:15.120
If a contestant could place seven markers in the correct position before time was up,

15:15.120 --> 15:17.360
they caught Carmen and won the grand prize.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.960
The prize location chosen by the contestants was only revealed when they won the game.

15:37.840 --> 15:42.720
And kids who didn't capture Carmen parted with a CD player and CDs from around the world,

15:42.720 --> 15:45.280
including the acapella soundtrack to the show.

15:45.280 --> 15:49.280
Win or lose, every episode ended with Greg and the contestant pointing to the camera

15:49.280 --> 15:51.440
and yelling the show's signature sign-off.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.880
Do it, Rockapella, triggering the band to perform Carmen's title theme.

16:06.400 --> 16:10.400
Production of the first season moved at a pace as frantic as the show itself.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.240
The entire 65-episode season would be shot in just six weeks,

16:14.240 --> 16:16.800
taping three to four episodes every workday.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.080
Being a PBS show,

16:18.080 --> 16:21.680
where in the world is Carmen San Diego aired without commercial interruptions,

16:21.680 --> 16:24.000
resulting in 27-minute episodes.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.760
For the first season, the cast and crew performed the episodes as if they were live.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.880
The exception was the chief, whose interactions were limited to

16:30.880 --> 16:32.960
clue-giving and skits with Greg.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.080
Lynn Thigpen prerecorded the chief segments for each episode,

16:36.080 --> 16:39.920
and the videos were intercut and shown on monitors to the contestants throughout the show.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.720
The game itself evolved over the first season,

16:42.720 --> 16:47.360
changing point values and dropping the three clues for each location in the final game.

16:47.360 --> 16:50.480
Rockapella frequently had to create impromptu songs and parodies

16:50.480 --> 16:52.640
mere minutes before the taping of segments.

16:52.640 --> 17:10.800
Viewers could hear the group's distinctive voice throughout the show,

17:10.800 --> 17:13.360
including in the narration for round two's memory board.

17:23.040 --> 17:32.160
The season wrapped on schedule in May of 1991,

17:32.160 --> 17:34.480
and PBS was pleased with the product.

17:34.480 --> 17:38.320
Where in the world is Carmen San Diego premiered on the afternoon of September 30th,

17:38.320 --> 17:42.160
1991, on PBS stations throughout the United States.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.120
That same night,

17:43.120 --> 17:47.600
PBS broadcast back-to-back episodes of the new show in its primetime slot.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.600
After this, the show aired Monday through Friday in the after-school block.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.720
Children across the country became instant fans of the show.

17:54.720 --> 17:59.520
The focus on high-energy fun paid off, and young viewers kept coming back for more.

17:59.520 --> 18:04.160
The show also drew a diverse audience, and the show itself was focused on diversity,

18:04.160 --> 18:07.280
both in its contestants and in its geography.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.760
Executive producer Kate Taylor explained,

18:09.760 --> 18:10.240
quote,

18:10.240 --> 18:12.960
We did not want to have a show that was culturally insensitive

18:12.960 --> 18:15.120
that focused too much on the Western world.

18:15.120 --> 18:19.280
We didn't want a show that too narrowly defined what geography really is.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.480
The show was renewed for a second 65 episodes season,

18:22.480 --> 18:25.680
moving production to the Kauffman Astoria Studios in Queens,

18:25.680 --> 18:27.440
the home of Sesame Street.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.000
This was not the only change made between seasons.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.600
In the early 1990s,

18:31.600 --> 18:34.640
massive geopolitical changes were happening throughout the world,

18:34.640 --> 18:38.640
and many maps and clues used during the first season were already out of date.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.600
Episodes after season one included the disclaimer,

18:41.600 --> 18:45.680
All geographic information was accurate as of the date this program was recorded.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.760
As countries changed their names or borders,

18:47.760 --> 18:50.080
the giant maps used on the show were updated,

18:50.080 --> 18:52.560
often overnight for recording the next day.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.960
The second season also expanded the grand prize

18:54.960 --> 18:57.920
to allow children to travel to anywhere in North America,

18:57.920 --> 19:00.400
rather than just the contiguous United States.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.520
Blumenthal would also push for more silliness for the second season,

19:03.520 --> 19:06.240
encouraging the staff to watch shows like Animaniacs

19:06.240 --> 19:08.560
and Rocky and Bullwinkle for inspiration.

19:08.560 --> 19:12.240
Greg Lee also joined the writing staff in addition to his hosting duties,

19:12.240 --> 19:15.440
and the series built a world of recurring characters and gags,

19:15.440 --> 19:18.480
frequently played by a Rockefeller member in some form.

19:18.480 --> 19:21.120
The show expanded Carmen's Gang of Crooks in season two

19:21.120 --> 19:23.760
to include the space alien, Nimoy,

19:23.760 --> 19:26.000
and the superhero character, Wonder Rat.

19:26.640 --> 19:30.240
Season two's first episode was the series' only double episode,

19:30.240 --> 19:32.960
where the contestants were paired with celebrity teammates,

19:32.960 --> 19:36.720
Mayim Bialik, Tatiana Ali, and Jeremy Miller.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.760
Celebrities also supported the series throughout its run

19:39.760 --> 19:42.480
by pre-recording clips as special agents of ACME,

19:42.480 --> 19:44.240
presenting clues to the players.

19:44.320 --> 19:49.840
Rhea Perlman, Sally Jessie Raphael, Walter Cronkite, Penn and Teller,

19:49.840 --> 19:53.440
Zap and Turbo, X The Owl, and Henrietta Pussycat,

19:53.440 --> 19:57.360
as performed by Mr. Rogers, and many more help deliver clues on the show.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.520
In one case, Greg Lee's mother provided the information to surprise her son.

20:14.240 --> 20:18.240
This alien came to town, and now we can't stop doing the tango.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.960
This is corn country, son, and farm folks have to get up early.

20:22.960 --> 20:28.000
Just because Fred Astaire was born in this state doesn't mean we all like dancing.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.760
Get here quick, Greg. Our feet can't hold out much longer.

20:32.640 --> 20:36.720
Can we please have a nice run of applause for the finest informant ever on this show?

20:37.120 --> 20:44.640
The second season also introduced a new game element called the chase,

20:44.640 --> 20:47.520
where contestants answered a quick progression of questions

20:47.520 --> 20:49.760
leading to the crooks predicted destination.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.960
In some cases, the chase was preceded by an actual chase

20:52.960 --> 20:55.600
throughout the sets and audience before the questions were asked.

21:06.720 --> 21:20.320
In the final episode of season two titled Gotta Get a Yeti,

21:20.320 --> 21:22.720
the series had its only geographic layer,

21:22.720 --> 21:27.200
causing the correct answer to be considered wrong and noted as such in the end credits.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.080
The contestant, who had been eliminated in the first round,

21:30.080 --> 21:32.320
was invited to come back in season three,

21:32.320 --> 21:35.280
where he won the game and caught Carmen Sandiego in Asia.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.240
And you should feel good. You came back the second time.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.120
You did it. A few moments ago, you wrote down where you'd like to go.

21:43.120 --> 21:45.360
If you caught Carmen Sandiego, you did it.

21:45.360 --> 21:49.600
So that means you and a parent are going to Florida.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.760
Season two of the show increased its audience size by 16%.

21:56.400 --> 22:04.160
By the end of 1992, the show was broadcasting on 92% of the 331 PBS transmitters in the United States.

22:04.160 --> 22:08.000
Approximately 5.4 million viewers watched at least once per week.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.560
The show won a Peabody Award, as well as a Daytime Emmy for Art Direction and Set Design.

22:12.560 --> 22:16.400
Broderbund continued its success with its line of Carmen Sandiego software,

22:16.400 --> 22:18.960
releasing a deluxe version of the original game,

22:18.960 --> 22:21.360
along with officially licensed board games.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.840
Another Carmen Sandiego series was developed,

22:23.840 --> 22:27.120
this time an animated serial produced by DIC Animation,

22:27.120 --> 22:29.840
called Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego?

22:29.840 --> 22:33.760
This Saturday morning cartoon premiered on Fox's Fox Kids Network block

22:33.760 --> 22:34.880
in 1994.

22:42.080 --> 22:45.680
The series followed ACME in their pursuit of Carmen Sandiego and Vile,

22:45.680 --> 22:49.920
and the animation incorporated elements from both the original game and the game show.

22:49.920 --> 22:53.600
The series would last for four seasons, for a total of 40 episodes,

22:53.600 --> 22:56.480
with the final episode premiering in 1999.

22:56.480 --> 23:00.880
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego was renewed for a third season on PBS.

23:00.880 --> 23:05.040
PBS created a new prize program for season three to reward the viewers at home.

23:05.040 --> 23:09.440
The chief instructed kids to write down the loot and location of each episode on a postcard.

23:09.440 --> 23:14.160
After listing four episodes of info, the kids mailed in their postcard to ACME CrimeNet.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.160
If correct, they entered into a drawing,

23:16.160 --> 23:20.080
and five kids each day won a Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego t-shirt.

23:20.080 --> 23:23.360
International versions of the show were also developed for broadcast,

23:23.360 --> 23:26.480
mimicking the show's style and friendly chief and Greg relationship.

23:31.600 --> 23:38.960
Season three of Carmen Sandiego would also consist of 64 episodes,

23:38.960 --> 23:42.080
and it would air from September to December 1993.

23:42.080 --> 23:46.240
The show would be renewed for a fourth and fifth season of 50 episodes each,

23:46.240 --> 23:49.520
airing in 1994 and 1995 respectively.

23:49.520 --> 23:54.240
These seasons brought more recurring characters, including Vile criminal Sarah Nade,

23:54.240 --> 23:58.080
and many alter egos for Greg Lee, including ACME man,

23:58.080 --> 24:02.000
Greg's retired detective father, Gus Lee, and Phil the Barber.

24:10.080 --> 24:12.240
In the last taped episode of season five,

24:12.240 --> 24:15.520
Phil the Barber surprised the audience and Rockefeller by cutting off

24:15.520 --> 24:18.320
Sean Altman's signature braided hair at the end of the show.

24:19.040 --> 24:23.840
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego was a great success for PBS, and the team that made it.

24:23.840 --> 24:27.520
But after five seasons, some believed it would be easier to secure funding

24:27.520 --> 24:30.160
for a new show rather than an existing one.

24:30.160 --> 24:35.680
Thus, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego's final episode aired on December 22, 1995.

24:36.240 --> 24:39.760
But a spin-off game show, Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego,

24:39.760 --> 24:42.320
would air starting in October less than a year later.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.640
Lynn Thigpen reprised her role as chief in the new series,

24:56.640 --> 25:00.400
but Greg Lee was replaced by Kevin Shinnick as the host of the new show,

25:00.400 --> 25:03.760
Where in Time was retooled significantly from the original game show,

25:03.760 --> 25:09.120
instead taking place in a science fiction setting and focusing on world history rather than geography.

25:09.120 --> 25:13.440
Also, the Vile characters were portrayed by actors instead of represented by animation.

25:14.400 --> 25:29.280
The new show's animation budget was instead spent on computer-generated 3D effects.

25:29.280 --> 25:33.200
Rockefeller was no longer featured, and a new theme song was created for the show,

25:33.200 --> 25:36.160
performed by the show's new musical troupe, The Engine Crew.

25:43.680 --> 25:49.840
Engine's hot, our friend's modern leader will help us give leader and bring back the loot

25:49.840 --> 25:56.160
to each rightful place in time. Tell me where in time is Carmen Sandiego?

25:56.160 --> 25:59.520
Stop that crime and solve this mystery.

25:59.520 --> 26:02.400
These are just a few of the many differences between the two shows.

26:03.040 --> 26:07.840
It's 1991. How many dollars are spent on advertising in the U.S.?

26:07.840 --> 26:10.560
37 billion or 37 trillion?

26:10.560 --> 26:11.520
37 billion!

26:13.520 --> 26:16.320
Energize the capture crystal! Now take it, Gloria!

26:16.320 --> 26:20.320
And run and place it in the Quinoa lost chamber to capture Carmen Sandiego!

26:29.920 --> 26:35.680
Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego would last for two seasons, for a total of 115 episodes.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.480
Since the conclusion of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego,

26:38.480 --> 26:43.680
the titular character has continued her cultural relevancy through consistent video game releases.

26:43.680 --> 26:47.680
Carmen Sandiego was also given a fourth television series on Netflix,

26:47.680 --> 26:50.720
which premiered in 2019 and ran for four seasons.

26:50.720 --> 26:54.640
This animated show incorporated elements from the original 90s animation,

26:54.640 --> 26:58.320
the computer games, and of course, the hit PBS game show.

26:58.560 --> 26:59.360
Yeah!

27:07.360 --> 27:11.360
Over the decades, geographical changes have made much of the trivia featured on

27:11.360 --> 27:14.880
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego outdated and incorrect.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.600
Fans can find VHS rips of the series on YouTube,

27:17.600 --> 27:19.920
but there have been no official releases of the show,

27:19.920 --> 27:23.440
and likely won't be due to the now factual inaccuracies.

27:23.520 --> 27:26.320
The game show is well remembered for its elaborate theming,

27:26.320 --> 27:29.760
high energy, production value, and talented cast.

27:29.760 --> 27:33.280
It is considered not only one of PBS's greatest children shows,

27:33.280 --> 27:36.160
but one of the greatest game shows created for children.

27:36.160 --> 27:39.760
Impressive considering it aired in the golden age of children's game shows.

27:40.320 --> 27:45.360
Above all, the show had a very specific goal of educating children on geography,

27:45.360 --> 27:49.760
a goal that it achieved and surpassed, resulting in not just education,

27:49.760 --> 27:52.800
but celebration of the world and its cultures.

27:52.800 --> 27:56.800
All of this wrapped inside a humorous, non-stop detective adventure.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.960
It is no wonder that the show was a hit,

27:58.960 --> 28:03.120
and it is obvious why millions of gumshoes tuned in every day to find out

28:03.120 --> 28:05.760
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

28:14.400 --> 28:18.400
All geographic information was accurate as of the date this program was recorded.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.400
It is also known as the World's Greatest Game Show.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.920
It is also known as the World's Greatest Game Show.

28:29.920 --> 28:33.200
It is also known as the World's Greatest Game Show.

28:33.200 --> 28:36.400
It is also known as the World's Greatest Game Show.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.520
It is also known as the World's Greatest Game Show.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.960
It is also known as the World's Greatest Game Show.

28:42.960 --> 28:46.960
It is also known as the World's Greatest Game Show.

28:46.960 --> 28:50.960
It is also known as the World's Greatest Game Show.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.120
The World's Greatest Game Show

28:53.120 --> 28:55.120
The World's Greatest Game Show
