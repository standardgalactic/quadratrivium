30960	40000	In 1980, brothers Doug and Gary Carlson founded their own computer software company named
40000	45040	Broaderbund. The Carlson brothers led Broaderbund to develop many popular titles, including
45040	53520	Choplifter, Gumball, Loadrunner, Karateca, and the Print Shop. By 1983, Broaderbund supported
53520	58560	a staff of over 40 people and sold millions of dollars worth of software annually. Despite
58560	63200	the stable business model, the Carlson brothers were nervous about one of their upcoming titles,
63200	69280	a new geography-based game named Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego. Lacking the confidence for a
69280	74560	standalone release, the brothers opted to release the game alongside a World Almanac. Despite the
74560	80240	hesitation, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego was a smash hit, immediately becoming the company's
80240	85040	most popular title. While computer enthusiasts were impressed by the game's four-color graphics
85040	90000	and innovative menu system, casual gamers were captivated by the globetrotting cat-and-mouse
90000	95680	gameplay and mix of trivia and humor. The game saw players pursuing the notorious thief Carmen
95680	101680	Sandiego and her gang of crooks throughout various countries and landmarks. Parents and teachers saw
101680	105920	its value as a teaching tool, and the software was purchased for computer labs throughout the
105920	111760	United States. By 1989, Carmen Sandiego was a budding franchise with the original game
111760	117680	spawning four sequels. Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego, Where in Europe is Carmen Sandiego,
117680	122640	Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego, and Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego.
122640	127520	The Carmen Sandiego franchise was soon a significant portion of Broderbund's 45 million
127520	132560	dollars in annual sales. The company had created an iconic character, and it was not long until
132560	137520	they looked into ways to expand the brand. Broderbund considered taking Carmen Sandiego from the
137600	142400	computer screen to the television screen. One potential partner was Walt Disney Television.
142400	147040	Producers from Disney had considered creating a Carmen Sandiego show for Disney Channel. This
147040	151280	would not come to fruition, and Broderbund continued their search. Around this time,
151280	155920	the company would receive a valuable piece of advice from a producer named Howard Blumenthal.
155920	160320	Blumenthal had worked on shows for MTV and Nickelodeon, and when Broderbund asked him to
160320	165280	consult on the development of a Carmen Sandiego series, he suggested an interesting strategy.
165280	169360	Blumenthal did not believe that licensing the show was where the money was. Rather,
169360	173520	the value of the television venture was national promotion of the Carmen Sandiego
173520	178480	software. Blumenthal recommended that Broderbund sell the television rights to Carmen Sandiego
178480	183600	to a public broadcasting service station, entrusting PBS to create a successful program
183600	188240	and deliver it to their large audience. The price that Blumenthal advised Broderbund to
188240	193600	sell the rights for? One dollar. By giving away the rights, the show was more likely to be produced
193600	198560	by PBS. Blumenthal left Broderbund with the advice and went to work on other shows. It would
198560	203360	take another few years, but Broderbund would eventually take his advice. Given the educational
203360	207840	focus of PBS children's shows, Broderbund would emphasize the geography of the Carmen
207840	212000	Sandiego series. The importance of the subject matter was highlighted by the release of a
212000	216720	National Geographic Survey that found that one in four Americans could not locate the Pacific
216720	222320	Ocean on a map, with a public need for geography education and a cheap, semi-recognizable property
222320	230160	of which to base a show. Two PBS stations, WQED Pittsburgh and WGBH Boston, agreed to co-produce
230160	235760	a pilot for a Carmen Sandiego television series. Broderbund opted to allow PBS to use the Carmen
235760	241760	Sandiego name and concept for free, $1 less than Blumenthal had suggested. Broderbund would again
241760	246640	reach out to Blumenthal for his help on the series, and he would join the project as a producer.
246640	253200	PBS ordered 65 episodes of the show, with a total budget of around $3.5 million. The Carmen
253200	257840	Sandiego name, character, and subject matter would not be the only elements taken from the
257840	263040	computer software. The game aspect would be adapted as well, with the PBS show utilizing a
263040	268480	game show format with adolescent contestants. The show's pilot episodes were shot at WQED's
268480	273040	studios in Pittsburgh. It was immediately clear to the team that the show needed work. In the
273040	277760	original pilots, the geography aspect of the game was educational, but it lacked the energy
277760	282320	necessary to attract children. Blumenthal knew that the children of the early 1990s
282320	287280	responded to quick, colorful content, like the shows found on MTV and Nickelodeon.
287280	292000	After the lackluster pilot episodes, Blumenthal knew that he needed to inject more energy into
292000	296720	the production, and in order to do this, he went straight to the source. Blumenthal personally
296720	301680	interviewed over 900 kids to acquire a sense of what they would like to see in a show. The kids
301680	308720	told him exactly what they wanted, adventure, silly characters, comedy, cool prizes, animation,
308720	313600	and music. These elements were the exact energy the show was lacking. In order to craft these into
313600	318720	a cohesive show, Blumenthal liked the idea of a 40s noir parody, integrating the genre
318720	322800	throughout the first script for the game show. The format would feature three young contestants
322800	328240	who would be classified as rookie detectives, assigned to hunt down Carmen Sandiego and her gang.
328240	332400	They would report to the chief, the head of ACME CrimeNet, as well as the host,
332400	336640	ACME's special agent in charge of training new recruits. With the new roles to fill,
336640	341120	the crew began casting for the series, and the production was moved from Pittsburgh to New York.
341120	345280	The show would find a new home at Chelsea Studios, where it would have plenty of room for a new,
345280	350320	elaborate, interconnected set that featured CrimeNet headquarters, the chief's office,
350320	356640	a city street, various international terminals, a giant floor map, and a studio audience of 200
356640	361520	kids. Greg Lee, a children's game show veteran that had worked as a contestant coordinator on
361520	366720	Nickelodeon's Double Dare and as a co-host on Total Panic, was cast as the show's host.
366720	371360	For the role of chief, Blumenthal fought to cast film and theater actress Lynn Thigpen,
371360	376000	as he had imagined her for the role when he conceived it. However, Thigpen repeatedly turned
376000	380240	down the opportunity due to the show's intense production schedule. As the production planned
380240	385280	on shooting the show's 65 episodes in just three months, Blumenthal auditioned hundreds of actors
385360	390080	for the role of chief, but it was clear to both him and Greg Lee that Thigpen was the best person
390080	394240	for the job. The two met with the actress over brunch and were able to convince her that she
394240	399040	was perfect for the part. Thigpen agreed to play chief in the game show. The show was coming together
399040	403200	quickly, but Blumenthal was still needing to integrate music into the show. He researched
403200	408080	different musical styles, and he specifically wanted to integrate rap music into the program.
408080	412640	It was during this investigation that Blumenthal would watch a laser disc of Spike Lee and company
412640	418640	Dewitt Acapella with his family. The PBS documentary, directed by Spike Lee, was focused on Acapella
418640	424000	music, and it featured a small band of singers named Acapella, singing an original song, Zombie
424000	434960	Jamboree. Blumenthal's wife suggested that he should use Acapella's music for the Carmen
434960	446000	San Diego show, and he took her suggestion. Acapella's music would become an integral
446000	451600	part of the show's energy. The singers, Sean Altman, Scott Leonard, Elliott Kerman, and Barry
451600	455520	Carl also pulled double duty as supporting cast to Greg in many sketches.
455520	475520	Now that's a clue, ladies and gentlemen. Acapella!
476560	481280	PBS assigned a portion of the show's budget for animated segments, so Blumenthal decided to
481280	486560	represent Carmen and her crew of criminals as 2D animations created on a Macintosh computer.
486560	490800	This approach was groundbreaking for the time, and logistically challenging since there was no
490800	495440	easy way to digitize the drawings. The workaround was sending the drawings through a fax machine
495440	500320	and then converting them for use on the computer. The often crude drawings of Carmen and her gang,
500320	505600	the group preferred to as vile, were weird, wacky, and a large source of the show's humor.
505600	509760	Criminal mastermind Carmen San Diego retained her appearance from the computer game,
509760	514480	with her trademark trench coat and radora. Many original criminals were created for the show,
514480	520960	including the Contessa, Patty Larsonie, Robo Crook, Top Grunge, Vic the Slick,
520960	525840	Eartha Brute, and the Double Trouble Twins. Each episode would feature a different crook,
525840	530320	and the Acme Crime Network recruits pursued Carmen San Diego in the finale of each show.
530320	534480	The digitally animated scenes also served to retain the feel of the computer games.
534480	538640	The final piece of the casting puzzle was the contestants. For every episode,
538720	543200	three gumshoes joined Acme Crime Network as new recruits. Lumenthal and the producer sought out
543200	548240	kids between the ages of 9 and 14, who could handle the pressures of a television game show.
548240	551440	They also made sure that the children had a strong knowledge of geography,
551440	555920	having them take a written exam before being selected. Every episode began with the chief
555920	557920	shouting over the rowdy child audience.
569520	581360	The chief then introduced the three contestants and the title of the episode's case,
581360	586240	usually a pun on a common phrase. Once in the Acme offices, Greg entered,
586240	590080	and after a very brief introduction began the game. The chief communicated with
590080	594800	contestants primarily via a television that Greg would tune. Cases for each episode involved
594800	598960	different members of Carmen's gang stealing important cultural works and landmarks.
598960	602960	In the first season, this included the Mona Lisa, the Great Wall of China,
603600	608160	the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and even Abraham Lincoln's nose from Mount Rushmore.
608960	612800	The chief showed footage that revealed the crooks' history and the item that was stolen,
612800	616880	before ordering the gumshoes to recover the stolen item, arrest the criminal,
616880	618480	and find Carmen San Diego.
625440	628480	Greg then explained the rules of the round,
628480	630560	and the chief returned briefly to provide a clue.
648240	652080	The three contestants were asked to answer a multiple-choice map-based question,
652160	655280	and were awarded or deducted points based on their answers.
655280	657840	Points on the show were referred to as Crime Box.
657840	660880	The questions in the first round were sandwiched between player vios.
665680	666400	Short sketches,
667200	671360	Oh my. Oh my. That was great. You're good.
671360	672400	Thank you. Yeah.
672400	673440	She should see my hamlet.
673440	674320	I'd love to see it.
675680	676160	Songs,
688320	689280	and guest agents.
689280	694640	I don't have much time, so listen carefully. Brush up on your German.
694640	697200	Most of these segments led into the next question.
697200	701040	Halfway through the match, a frustrated chief would call Greg into her office,
701040	704800	upset that he and the recruits had yet to capture the crook or San Diego.
704800	708720	To motivate the detectives, she offered a free trip to anywhere in the contiguous
708720	711520	United States, which was the show's grand prize.
711520	715600	Find Carmen, and I will send you anywhere in the whole country.
715600	717440	Chief, we can't do that.
717440	717840	Why not?
719040	722720	Oh. Anywhere in the lower 48 states.
722720	723440	Hey.
723440	724640	Hey, it's still a heck of a deal.
724640	725280	Heck of a deal.
726480	728160	Once back at the Acme office,
728160	732160	Greg played a recording of a tapped phone call between Carmen and the crook of the day.
732160	735040	The call would contain clues to the crook's next destination,
735040	737920	and the trio detectives would determine where to travel to next.
738640	742720	Head for a South American country with two capital cities.
742720	744960	Take the towers to the legal capital.
744960	746640	Good thinking, Carmen.
746640	749280	Acme won't figure us for anything legal.
749840	753520	The final question of the first round displayed a map with three locations.
753520	754960	Before revealing the question,
754960	758000	the contestants could wager between zero and 50 crime bucks
758000	760480	that they could answer the question correctly when asked.
760480	762640	So take a look at this map and think about it.
763040	778320	At the end of the round,
778320	781280	the lowest-scoring gumshoe was eliminated from the competition,
781280	783120	but they were not sent home empty-handed.
783120	785920	The eliminated contestant was awarded an Acme travel kit,
785920	787440	including a World Atlas,
787440	790560	a year subscription to National Geographic World Magazine,
790560	794560	an official Carmen San Diego watch, and other Carmen swag.
794560	797760	The show's second round began with the chief debriefing the remaining detectives
797760	800560	on a specific location that the crook was traveling to.
800560	804640	She presented historical, geographical, and cultural information
804640	807360	about the destination as a slide presentation.
807360	810080	Greg and the recruits arrived at the terminal of the location,
810080	813360	and a memory-style game featuring a large board was played.
813360	815760	Contestants alternated revealing portions of the board
815760	818800	in pursuit of the loot, the warrant, and the crook.
821520	831600	The first to find all three and put the crook in jail
831600	833600	advanced to the next and final round.
833600	836560	A runner-up prize was awarded to the loser of the second round,
836560	838480	which included the Acme travel kit,
838480	842320	along with the addition of a pocket translator and a world-band radio.
842320	843840	Before starting the final round,
843840	847760	the winning detective would write down their grand prize destination city for Greg.
847760	851280	The captured crooks called the new agent to inform them of Carmen's location,
851280	856240	narrowed down to either the United States, South America, Europe, Africa, or Asia.
861280	864320	And the chief rattled off a list of places Carmen may have traveled.
864880	871760	Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia, North Korea, Japan.
876400	879680	Greg then took the contestant to a giant map of the location.
879680	882640	The contestant had 45 seconds to race around the map,
882640	884960	placing light-up markers on the correct locations
884960	887760	as Greg rattled off clues followed by the location name.
894880	898000	If the contestant set the marker wrong,
898000	899920	they got a second chance before moving on.
911120	915120	If a contestant could place seven markers in the correct position before time was up,
915120	917360	they caught Carmen and won the grand prize.
927040	930960	The prize location chosen by the contestants was only revealed when they won the game.
937840	942720	And kids who didn't capture Carmen parted with a CD player and CDs from around the world,
942720	945280	including the acapella soundtrack to the show.
945280	949280	Win or lose, every episode ended with Greg and the contestant pointing to the camera
949280	951440	and yelling the show's signature sign-off.
951440	954880	Do it, Rockapella, triggering the band to perform Carmen's title theme.
966400	970400	Production of the first season moved at a pace as frantic as the show itself.
970400	974240	The entire 65-episode season would be shot in just six weeks,
974240	976800	taping three to four episodes every workday.
976800	978080	Being a PBS show,
978080	981680	where in the world is Carmen San Diego aired without commercial interruptions,
981680	984000	resulting in 27-minute episodes.
984000	987760	For the first season, the cast and crew performed the episodes as if they were live.
987760	990880	The exception was the chief, whose interactions were limited to
990880	992960	clue-giving and skits with Greg.
992960	996080	Lynn Thigpen prerecorded the chief segments for each episode,
996080	999920	and the videos were intercut and shown on monitors to the contestants throughout the show.
1000400	1002720	The game itself evolved over the first season,
1002720	1007360	changing point values and dropping the three clues for each location in the final game.
1007360	1010480	Rockapella frequently had to create impromptu songs and parodies
1010480	1012640	mere minutes before the taping of segments.
1012640	1030800	Viewers could hear the group's distinctive voice throughout the show,
1030800	1033360	including in the narration for round two's memory board.
1043040	1052160	The season wrapped on schedule in May of 1991,
1052160	1054480	and PBS was pleased with the product.
1054480	1058320	Where in the world is Carmen San Diego premiered on the afternoon of September 30th,
1058320	1062160	1991, on PBS stations throughout the United States.
1062160	1063120	That same night,
1063120	1067600	PBS broadcast back-to-back episodes of the new show in its primetime slot.
1067600	1071600	After this, the show aired Monday through Friday in the after-school block.
1071600	1074720	Children across the country became instant fans of the show.
1074720	1079520	The focus on high-energy fun paid off, and young viewers kept coming back for more.
1079520	1084160	The show also drew a diverse audience, and the show itself was focused on diversity,
1084160	1087280	both in its contestants and in its geography.
1087280	1089760	Executive producer Kate Taylor explained,
1089760	1090240	quote,
1090240	1092960	We did not want to have a show that was culturally insensitive
1092960	1095120	that focused too much on the Western world.
1095120	1099280	We didn't want a show that too narrowly defined what geography really is.
1099280	1102480	The show was renewed for a second 65 episodes season,
1102480	1105680	moving production to the Kauffman Astoria Studios in Queens,
1105680	1107440	the home of Sesame Street.
1107440	1110000	This was not the only change made between seasons.
1110000	1111600	In the early 1990s,
1111600	1114640	massive geopolitical changes were happening throughout the world,
1114640	1118640	and many maps and clues used during the first season were already out of date.
1118640	1121600	Episodes after season one included the disclaimer,
1121600	1125680	All geographic information was accurate as of the date this program was recorded.
1125680	1127760	As countries changed their names or borders,
1127760	1130080	the giant maps used on the show were updated,
1130080	1132560	often overnight for recording the next day.
1132560	1134960	The second season also expanded the grand prize
1134960	1137920	to allow children to travel to anywhere in North America,
1137920	1140400	rather than just the contiguous United States.
1140400	1143520	Blumenthal would also push for more silliness for the second season,
1143520	1146240	encouraging the staff to watch shows like Animaniacs
1146240	1148560	and Rocky and Bullwinkle for inspiration.
1148560	1152240	Greg Lee also joined the writing staff in addition to his hosting duties,
1152240	1155440	and the series built a world of recurring characters and gags,
1155440	1158480	frequently played by a Rockefeller member in some form.
1158480	1161120	The show expanded Carmen's Gang of Crooks in season two
1161120	1163760	to include the space alien, Nimoy,
1163760	1166000	and the superhero character, Wonder Rat.
1166640	1170240	Season two's first episode was the series' only double episode,
1170240	1172960	where the contestants were paired with celebrity teammates,
1172960	1176720	Mayim Bialik, Tatiana Ali, and Jeremy Miller.
1177280	1179760	Celebrities also supported the series throughout its run
1179760	1182480	by pre-recording clips as special agents of ACME,
1182480	1184240	presenting clues to the players.
1184320	1189840	Rhea Perlman, Sally Jessie Raphael, Walter Cronkite, Penn and Teller,
1189840	1193440	Zap and Turbo, X The Owl, and Henrietta Pussycat,
1193440	1197360	as performed by Mr. Rogers, and many more help deliver clues on the show.
1207840	1211520	In one case, Greg Lee's mother provided the information to surprise her son.
1214240	1218240	This alien came to town, and now we can't stop doing the tango.
1218800	1222960	This is corn country, son, and farm folks have to get up early.
1222960	1228000	Just because Fred Astaire was born in this state doesn't mean we all like dancing.
1228640	1231760	Get here quick, Greg. Our feet can't hold out much longer.
1232640	1236720	Can we please have a nice run of applause for the finest informant ever on this show?
1237120	1244640	The second season also introduced a new game element called the chase,
1244640	1247520	where contestants answered a quick progression of questions
1247520	1249760	leading to the crooks predicted destination.
1249760	1252960	In some cases, the chase was preceded by an actual chase
1252960	1255600	throughout the sets and audience before the questions were asked.
1266720	1280320	In the final episode of season two titled Gotta Get a Yeti,
1280320	1282720	the series had its only geographic layer,
1282720	1287200	causing the correct answer to be considered wrong and noted as such in the end credits.
1287200	1290080	The contestant, who had been eliminated in the first round,
1290080	1292320	was invited to come back in season three,
1292320	1295280	where he won the game and caught Carmen Sandiego in Asia.
1297440	1300240	And you should feel good. You came back the second time.
1300240	1303120	You did it. A few moments ago, you wrote down where you'd like to go.
1303120	1305360	If you caught Carmen Sandiego, you did it.
1305360	1309600	So that means you and a parent are going to Florida.
1312880	1315760	Season two of the show increased its audience size by 16%.
1316400	1324160	By the end of 1992, the show was broadcasting on 92% of the 331 PBS transmitters in the United States.
1324160	1328000	Approximately 5.4 million viewers watched at least once per week.
1328000	1332560	The show won a Peabody Award, as well as a Daytime Emmy for Art Direction and Set Design.
1332560	1336400	Broderbund continued its success with its line of Carmen Sandiego software,
1336400	1338960	releasing a deluxe version of the original game,
1338960	1341360	along with officially licensed board games.
1341360	1343840	Another Carmen Sandiego series was developed,
1343840	1347120	this time an animated serial produced by DIC Animation,
1347120	1349840	called Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego?
1349840	1353760	This Saturday morning cartoon premiered on Fox's Fox Kids Network block
1353760	1354880	in 1994.
1362080	1365680	The series followed ACME in their pursuit of Carmen Sandiego and Vile,
1365680	1369920	and the animation incorporated elements from both the original game and the game show.
1369920	1373600	The series would last for four seasons, for a total of 40 episodes,
1373600	1376480	with the final episode premiering in 1999.
1376480	1380880	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego was renewed for a third season on PBS.
1380880	1385040	PBS created a new prize program for season three to reward the viewers at home.
1385040	1389440	The chief instructed kids to write down the loot and location of each episode on a postcard.
1389440	1394160	After listing four episodes of info, the kids mailed in their postcard to ACME CrimeNet.
1394160	1396160	If correct, they entered into a drawing,
1396160	1400080	and five kids each day won a Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego t-shirt.
1400080	1403360	International versions of the show were also developed for broadcast,
1403360	1406480	mimicking the show's style and friendly chief and Greg relationship.
1411600	1418960	Season three of Carmen Sandiego would also consist of 64 episodes,
1418960	1422080	and it would air from September to December 1993.
1422080	1426240	The show would be renewed for a fourth and fifth season of 50 episodes each,
1426240	1429520	airing in 1994 and 1995 respectively.
1429520	1434240	These seasons brought more recurring characters, including Vile criminal Sarah Nade,
1434240	1438080	and many alter egos for Greg Lee, including ACME man,
1438080	1442000	Greg's retired detective father, Gus Lee, and Phil the Barber.
1450080	1452240	In the last taped episode of season five,
1452240	1455520	Phil the Barber surprised the audience and Rockefeller by cutting off
1455520	1458320	Sean Altman's signature braided hair at the end of the show.
1459040	1463840	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego was a great success for PBS, and the team that made it.
1463840	1467520	But after five seasons, some believed it would be easier to secure funding
1467520	1470160	for a new show rather than an existing one.
1470160	1475680	Thus, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego's final episode aired on December 22, 1995.
1476240	1479760	But a spin-off game show, Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego,
1479760	1482320	would air starting in October less than a year later.
1493600	1496640	Lynn Thigpen reprised her role as chief in the new series,
1496640	1500400	but Greg Lee was replaced by Kevin Shinnick as the host of the new show,
1500400	1503760	Where in Time was retooled significantly from the original game show,
1503760	1509120	instead taking place in a science fiction setting and focusing on world history rather than geography.
1509120	1513440	Also, the Vile characters were portrayed by actors instead of represented by animation.
1514400	1529280	The new show's animation budget was instead spent on computer-generated 3D effects.
1529280	1533200	Rockefeller was no longer featured, and a new theme song was created for the show,
1533200	1536160	performed by the show's new musical troupe, The Engine Crew.
1543680	1549840	Engine's hot, our friend's modern leader will help us give leader and bring back the loot
1549840	1556160	to each rightful place in time. Tell me where in time is Carmen Sandiego?
1556160	1559520	Stop that crime and solve this mystery.
1559520	1562400	These are just a few of the many differences between the two shows.
1563040	1567840	It's 1991. How many dollars are spent on advertising in the U.S.?
1567840	1570560	37 billion or 37 trillion?
1570560	1571520	37 billion!
1573520	1576320	Energize the capture crystal! Now take it, Gloria!
1576320	1580320	And run and place it in the Quinoa lost chamber to capture Carmen Sandiego!
1589920	1595680	Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego would last for two seasons, for a total of 115 episodes.
1595680	1598480	Since the conclusion of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego,
1598480	1603680	the titular character has continued her cultural relevancy through consistent video game releases.
1603680	1607680	Carmen Sandiego was also given a fourth television series on Netflix,
1607680	1610720	which premiered in 2019 and ran for four seasons.
1610720	1614640	This animated show incorporated elements from the original 90s animation,
1614640	1618320	the computer games, and of course, the hit PBS game show.
1618560	1619360	Yeah!
1627360	1631360	Over the decades, geographical changes have made much of the trivia featured on
1631360	1634880	Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego outdated and incorrect.
1634880	1637600	Fans can find VHS rips of the series on YouTube,
1637600	1639920	but there have been no official releases of the show,
1639920	1643440	and likely won't be due to the now factual inaccuracies.
1643520	1646320	The game show is well remembered for its elaborate theming,
1646320	1649760	high energy, production value, and talented cast.
1649760	1653280	It is considered not only one of PBS's greatest children shows,
1653280	1656160	but one of the greatest game shows created for children.
1656160	1659760	Impressive considering it aired in the golden age of children's game shows.
1660320	1665360	Above all, the show had a very specific goal of educating children on geography,
1665360	1669760	a goal that it achieved and surpassed, resulting in not just education,
1669760	1672800	but celebration of the world and its cultures.
1672800	1676800	All of this wrapped inside a humorous, non-stop detective adventure.
1676800	1678960	It is no wonder that the show was a hit,
1678960	1683120	and it is obvious why millions of gumshoes tuned in every day to find out
1683120	1685760	Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?
1694400	1698400	All geographic information was accurate as of the date this program was recorded.
