00:00.000 --> 00:06.560
I'm Najja Swat for business.com and joining me today is Dr. John Christie, climate scientist at

00:06.560 --> 00:13.200
the University of Alabama in Huntsville and Alabama state climatologist since 2000. Dr. Christie,

00:13.200 --> 00:20.720
thank you so much for your time. My pleasure. You've described yourself as a climate nerd

00:20.720 --> 00:27.520
and apparently you were 12 when your unwaving desire to understand whether and climate started.

00:28.400 --> 00:36.080
Why climate? Well, I was, I think it was more like 10 years old when I was fascinated with

00:37.040 --> 00:43.520
some unusual weather events that happened in my home area of California and so that began a

00:43.520 --> 00:50.000
fascination for me and I wanted to try to figure out why things happened the way they did. Why

00:50.000 --> 00:55.520
did one year have more rain? That's a big story in California. Does it rain or not? And another year

00:55.520 --> 01:01.920
would be very dry. Why were the mountains covered with snow in one April and not another? In fact,

01:01.920 --> 01:13.120
I have here April 1967 that I recorded as a teenager. So this has been a passion of mine forever and

01:13.840 --> 01:20.560
as it turns out now that I'm as old as I am, I still can't figure out why one year is wetter

01:20.560 --> 01:28.240
than the other. Well, you seem to be getting a lot closer than most people. I think it was in 1989

01:28.240 --> 01:37.520
when you and NASA scientist Roy Spencer pioneered a new method of measuring monitoring temperature

01:37.520 --> 01:46.320
records via satellites. Since that time up until now, why did you feel you needed to develop a

01:46.320 --> 01:53.760
new method to begin with and how did it differ in terms of the readings of established methods at

01:53.760 --> 02:02.400
the time? Well, the issue was we only had surface temperature measurements and they are scattered

02:02.400 --> 02:06.720
over the world. They don't cover much of the world at all actually, mainly just the land regions

02:06.720 --> 02:13.360
and scattered places on the ocean. The measurement itself is not that robust. The stations move,

02:13.360 --> 02:17.120
the instruments change through time and so it's a very difficult thing to make. In fact,

02:17.920 --> 02:25.280
a small little change in the area right around the station can really affect the temperature

02:25.280 --> 02:30.880
of that station. So Roy Spencer and Dick McKnighter came up with an idea about looking at some

02:30.880 --> 02:37.520
satellite data and this is the temperature of the deep layer of the atmosphere. So this is like the

02:37.520 --> 02:45.200
surface to 8,000 meters, you know, something like that and so if we could see the temperature of that

02:45.200 --> 02:52.320
bulk atmospheric layer, we would have a very robust measurement and the microwave sensors on the

02:52.320 --> 02:58.560
NOAA polo orbiting satellites did precisely that and so we were the first to really put those data

02:58.560 --> 03:09.280
into a simple data set that had the temperature then for month by month since about November 1978.

03:11.040 --> 03:16.480
Okay and how did your readings differ from the climate science at the time?

03:18.400 --> 03:23.760
Well, first of all, they differ because we had a global measurement. We really did see the entire

03:23.760 --> 03:28.960
globe from satellite because the orbit of that satellite is polar and the earth spins around

03:28.960 --> 03:33.680
underneath so every day we have 14 orbits that the earth spins around underneath and we see the

03:33.680 --> 03:39.760
entire planet so that's one big difference and the other one is that the actual result did not

03:39.760 --> 03:45.680
show as much warming as what the surface temperatures showed and we're doing even more work now to

03:45.680 --> 03:53.760
demonstrate that a lot of the surface stations are spuriously affected by the growth of an

03:53.760 --> 03:57.760
infrastructure around them and so there's kind of a false warming signal there.

03:57.760 --> 04:01.920
You don't get the background climate signal with surface temperature measurements, you get

04:02.560 --> 04:04.960
a bit of what's happening in the local area.

04:05.680 --> 04:17.360
Well, your research has to do with testing the theories posited by climate model forecasts

04:17.360 --> 04:25.840
so you don't actually do any modeling yourself but what criteria do you use to test these theories?

04:26.720 --> 04:33.520
That's a very good question because in climate you hear all kinds of claims and theories being

04:33.520 --> 04:39.680
thrown out there and for a lot of people who don't really understand the climate system it's a

04:39.680 --> 04:45.120
quick and easy answer just to say oh humans caused that you know global warming or something like

04:45.120 --> 04:50.080
that is the answer when the climate system is very complex so we look at these claims

04:50.080 --> 04:56.960
and Roy Spencer and I when I say we are just a few of the people around the world that actually

04:56.960 --> 05:03.680
build data sets from scratch. I mean we start with the photon counts of the satellite radiometers

05:03.680 --> 05:12.000
or the you know the original paper records of 19th century East Africa. We do all this from scratch

05:12.560 --> 05:18.080
and so that we can test the claims that people make and what we find is that once we build the

05:18.080 --> 05:24.160
data set we make sure we have confidence in the data set that it's telling us a truth about what's

05:24.160 --> 05:32.080
happening over time we can determine that as well or test it then we check the claim. So for

05:32.080 --> 05:36.880
example on surface temperature data sets that we make that go back to the 19th century someone will

05:36.880 --> 05:43.440
say well this is the hottest decade or more records happened this decade than in the past and we can

05:43.440 --> 05:48.160
demonstrate in the United States especially that that's not the case that you would need to go back

05:48.160 --> 05:55.280
to the 1930s if you want to see real record temperatures that occurred at that time and for

05:55.280 --> 06:03.840
climate models we like to use the satellite data set it's a robust deep layer measurement so it's

06:03.840 --> 06:10.880
measuring lots of mass of the atmosphere the heat content really and so that's a direct value we can

06:10.880 --> 06:16.320
get out of the climate models so we are comparing what we say apples to apples what the satellite

06:16.320 --> 06:22.560
produces and observes is what the climate model also generates and we can compare them one to one

06:23.120 --> 06:29.440
and in the paper Ross McKintock and I wrote a couple of years ago we found that 100% of the

06:29.440 --> 06:35.840
climate models were warming the atmosphere faster than it was actually warming so that's not a good

06:35.840 --> 06:41.600
result if you're trying to test your theory of how the climate works with a model against what

06:41.600 --> 06:50.160
actually happens with the models how much do you think of the deeply over exaggerated

06:51.280 --> 06:56.080
predictions that doom and gloom have to do with the fact that the methodology is

06:56.800 --> 07:03.120
it's substantiated by confirmation bias well you know that that's an interesting question because

07:03.120 --> 07:10.240
we're a bit confused as well is we have been publishing these papers since 1994 that have

07:10.240 --> 07:17.600
demonstrated models warm too much relative to the actual climate and yet we don't see an improvement

07:17.600 --> 07:25.120
in climate models and trying to match reality with their model output now I think a number of

07:25.120 --> 07:33.200
modelers understand that yes there is a difference there and it's the models are just too hot but

07:33.200 --> 07:38.480
what is the process that's gone wrong in the models to make that is a difficult question for

07:38.480 --> 07:46.400
these folks because models have hundreds of places you could turn a little knob change a coefficient

07:46.400 --> 07:51.200
and that will change the result now it's not a physical thing it's not based on physics it's

07:51.200 --> 07:58.160
it's the model parameterizations we call them the little pieces of the model that try to represent

07:59.200 --> 08:05.760
an actual part of the atmosphere like when do clouds form that's a pretty big question is

08:06.400 --> 08:12.960
how much humidity in the atmosphere is required to create a cloud because once the cloud forms

08:12.960 --> 08:17.360
that reflects sunlight and cools the earth so that's it that's one of the big questions there is

08:18.800 --> 08:26.560
so in testing the models we like to use the bulk atmospheric temperature that's a very direct

08:26.560 --> 08:34.000
measurement that models produce in the atmosphere produce and so we can then say there's a problem

08:34.000 --> 08:43.760
here with climate models to what degree the dual observations data differ from their forecasts

08:45.280 --> 08:51.600
well generally it's about a factor of two at times it's been more but the latest models on

08:51.600 --> 08:57.200
average the models for the deep layer of the atmosphere are warming about twice too fast

08:57.920 --> 09:04.800
and that's a real problem I think when now we're looking at over 40 years what we can test these

09:04.800 --> 09:12.880
models with and they're already that far off and so I will we should not use them to to tell us

09:12.880 --> 09:16.320
what's going to happen in the future since they haven't even gotten us to the right place in the

09:16.320 --> 09:26.880
last four years but given that your real world data it's refuted what the forecasts were every

09:26.880 --> 09:38.240
time for decades why then and I recognize that this is conjecture we can't really be sure but on

09:39.360 --> 09:47.440
let's say 97 99 percent of scientists so firmly behind the climate crisis narrative

09:49.760 --> 09:54.400
yeah I don't know how many are really fully behind that crisis climate narrative I

09:55.120 --> 10:02.880
saw a recent survey where about 55 percent might have been of the opinion that the climate warming

10:02.880 --> 10:09.840
was going to be a problem warming itself is not a problem I mean the earth has been warmer in the

10:09.840 --> 10:18.320
past than it is today so the earth has survived that before and I don't think putting extra

10:18.720 --> 10:26.560
you know plant food in the atmosphere is going to be a real problem for us to overcome I do think

10:26.560 --> 10:30.640
the world is going to warm some from the extra CO2 but there are a lot of benefits that come from

10:30.640 --> 10:41.200
that by the way you're dealing with a question about human nature and funding and so on and I

10:41.200 --> 10:46.480
think we all know that the more dramatic a story is especially in the political world

10:47.440 --> 10:54.000
the more attention you will get and therefore your work can be highlighted and that helps you

10:54.000 --> 11:01.840
with funding and attention and so on and that's kind of part of what's going on here then there's

11:01.840 --> 11:12.640
the other real stronger political narrative that folks there are groups and in the world

11:13.280 --> 11:19.600
political elite that like to have a narrative that scares people so that they can then offer a

11:19.600 --> 11:26.800
solution and so simple way to say elect me to this office and I will be able to solve this problem

11:26.800 --> 11:34.480
that you are facing people like us who actually produce the data and look at you know extreme

11:34.480 --> 11:39.040
events and so on say well you know there isn't any change in these extreme events so what's the

11:39.040 --> 11:44.560
problem you're trying to solve and then we look at the other side of that issue and say okay if you

11:44.560 --> 11:50.800
actually implement this regulation or this law it's not going to have any make any difference on

11:50.800 --> 11:57.120
the climate anyway so it's a you kind of lose on two ends on that story. You're a distinguished

11:57.120 --> 12:03.120
professor of atmospheric science and also director of earth sciences also at Alabama in Huntsville

12:03.840 --> 12:10.720
these are prominent positions how have you managed to hold on to them with climate views

12:10.720 --> 12:20.000
that are so divergent from the norm? Well the environment in the state of Alabama is different

12:20.000 --> 12:26.960
than what you have in Washington and as I like to tell people that one of the reasons I like to

12:26.960 --> 12:32.400
live in Alabama and I'm from California way across the country is that in Alabama you can

12:32.400 --> 12:40.560
call a duck a duck that you can just be flat on about what's going on and you're not going to be

12:40.560 --> 12:49.120
given the evil eye or cast out as it is now in the climate establishment you know saying that all

12:49.120 --> 12:56.080
the models are warming too much and that there is not a disaster arising that causes great consternation

12:56.080 --> 13:01.280
because of the narrative that has been built over the last 30 years that we are supposed to be in a

13:01.280 --> 13:07.120
catastrophe and to come out and say well here's the data and the data show there is no catastrophe

13:07.120 --> 13:14.160
looming we're doing fine the world is doing fine human life is thriving in places it's allowed to

13:14.160 --> 13:20.480
so what's the problem here you're trying to solve? Did you ever manage to get your findings to

13:22.160 --> 13:29.360
policy makers that have interest to do something about it? Well you know I've been

13:29.920 --> 13:37.040
to Congress 20 times testified before hearings so the information is there and available

13:38.080 --> 13:47.200
but I can't force Congress to make legislation that matches the real world the congressional world

13:47.200 --> 13:54.080
is a political world and things happen there that are kind of out of my reach and ability to influence

13:54.160 --> 14:01.200
I suppose. According to your research you've also said that the climate models underestimate

14:01.200 --> 14:08.480
negative feedback loops so can you explain to me what this mechanism is and the effect of

14:09.680 --> 14:15.840
overestimation of the loops on understanding climate for what it is? All right now that's a

14:15.840 --> 14:21.680
very complicated issue and I don't understand it all for sure but we can say just from some

14:21.680 --> 14:27.920
general results in general observation what's going on here and one of those general observation is

14:27.920 --> 14:37.680
that when a climate model warms up the atmosphere one Kelvin one degree that it sends out 1.4 watts

14:37.680 --> 14:47.040
per meter squared so the air atmosphere warms up and energy escapes to space 1.4 when we use

14:47.040 --> 14:53.520
actual observations of the atmosphere when the real atmosphere warms up one Kelvin it sends out

14:53.520 --> 15:00.800
2.6 watts of energy almost twice as much so that tells you right there that the climate models are

15:00.800 --> 15:08.800
retaining or holding on to energy that the real world allows to escape when it warms so that's

15:08.800 --> 15:14.720
kind of a negative feedback that as the atmosphere warms for a bit the real world knows how to let

15:14.720 --> 15:20.720
that heat escape whereas the models don't and they retain it and that's why they keep building up heat

15:20.720 --> 15:28.880
over time. What other variables do you look at? Yeah the state climatologists I deal a lot with

15:29.520 --> 15:34.240
very practical questions that people ask they want them is it getting hotter is it getting

15:34.240 --> 15:40.240
wetter are the rainstorms getting heavier and so are the hurricanes getting worse and so I actually

15:40.800 --> 15:47.280
wrote a booklet called I practical guide to climate change in Alabama but it covers a lot of the

15:47.280 --> 15:52.320
country as well so it's not just this it's free you can download it from my website

15:54.320 --> 15:59.360
the Alabama state climatologist is on the first page and I answer a lot of these very practical

15:59.360 --> 16:09.040
questions and one as we go down the list there aren't any more droughts droughts are not getting

16:09.120 --> 16:16.480
worse over time heavy rainstorms are not getting worse over time here in the southeast in fact

16:16.480 --> 16:21.840
Ross McKittrick and I also had a paper on that where we went back to 1878 and demonstrated that

16:21.840 --> 16:28.640
the trends are not significant hurricanes no they're not going up at all in fact 2022 is going to be

16:28.640 --> 16:35.840
one of the quietest that we've had in a while tornadoes are not becoming more numerous heat

16:35.840 --> 16:42.640
waves are not becoming worse so one after another though the weather that people really care about

16:42.640 --> 16:50.160
that if it changes could cause problem or catastrophe we find those events are not changing

16:50.160 --> 17:02.560
they've always been around some of the biggest critics of climate skeptics say okay yes no fair

17:03.280 --> 17:12.080
one extreme weather event doesn't say much but they argue that they are very particular trends

17:12.080 --> 17:20.160
that have been on the increase like recently have you observed this at all that's exactly

17:20.160 --> 17:27.600
the kind of thing we build data sets to discover for example there is a story and there is some

17:27.600 --> 17:33.840
evidence for it that in the last hundred years there's been an increase in in heavy rain events

17:33.840 --> 17:40.160
in part of our country not all of it just part of the country so I built a data set that went back

17:40.160 --> 17:46.560
to the 1870s in fact it back to the 1860s and so on and we looked at that very carefully and found

17:46.560 --> 17:54.240
that well when you go back far enough there were a lot of heavy events back then and so over the

17:54.240 --> 18:03.920
long time period of 140 years or more we don't see an upward trend that's unusual in that sample of

18:03.920 --> 18:12.480
time 140 years that we don't see a change in those kind of events so that's why you know one of the

18:12.480 --> 18:19.440
real things I think has great value to it is to build these data sets so you can specifically

18:19.440 --> 18:26.240
answer the question and the claim that is being made I think one of the worst ones was made by

18:26.240 --> 18:32.240
the New York Times when they were talking about how many record high temperatures occurred in a

18:32.240 --> 18:38.800
recent heatwave around the country and so I looked at that a little bit more carefully and they were

18:38.800 --> 18:46.800
allowing stations to be included that only had 30 years or less of data even less than 30 years

18:46.880 --> 18:52.960
so some had 100 years but a lot of them just had 30 years well when you become very systematic and

18:52.960 --> 18:58.800
say okay I'm only going to allow stations that have 100 years so that every station that measured

18:58.800 --> 19:04.960
in 2022 can be compared with the entire time series and then their story falls apart because

19:04.960 --> 19:09.760
the 30s and the 50s were so hot in our country that they still hold the records for the number

19:09.760 --> 19:18.160
of high temperature events just the scary thing for me is that as much as it completely falls

19:18.160 --> 19:25.920
apart there's no logic to it it still firmly stands as what most people believe you have to

19:25.920 --> 19:32.240
give credit to those who in the climate establishment and the media or whoever is behind all this that

19:32.240 --> 19:38.800
they have been successful in scaring people about the climate because now you find that even in

19:38.800 --> 19:47.200
grade school textbooks and almost every new story that comes out will try to throw in and this is

19:47.200 --> 19:53.600
where this establishment is very good is they make sure every story has some kind of line in it about

19:53.600 --> 19:59.840
climate change and they don't ever go back and talk to someone who actually builds these data

19:59.840 --> 20:05.840
set sentences is that really the worst it's been in the last 120 years they just make those claims

20:05.840 --> 20:14.160
and so other than the fact the sea level is rising a bit the extreme events are just not

20:15.040 --> 20:24.800
there to really cause problems now we are in a problem of having greater damages occur because

20:24.800 --> 20:30.880
of extreme events and that's mainly because we've just built so much more stuff and placed it in harm's

20:30.880 --> 20:40.320
way our coastlines are crowded with condominiums and uh entertainment parks and uh retirement

20:40.320 --> 20:44.960
villages and so on there's so many more of them that when a hurricane does come well it's going

20:44.960 --> 20:50.640
to wipe out a lot more and so we've served sure the damages the the absolute value of those damages

20:50.640 --> 20:56.960
has gone up but the number of hurricanes their strength and so on the background climate has

20:57.040 --> 21:02.160
not caused that problem it's just that we like to build things in places that are dangerous

21:02.720 --> 21:07.520
we have you know records of sea level rise and it's on the order of about an inch per decade

21:07.520 --> 21:14.320
except in places where the land is sinking pretty rapidly and you can find that on the Louisiana

21:14.320 --> 21:21.280
Gulf Coast and in places like that but otherwise it's about an inch per decade and I tell folks

21:22.240 --> 21:28.640
that an inch per decade you know if they want to have centimeters a decade is not your problem

21:29.600 --> 21:38.880
it's 10 feet in six hours from the next hurricane that's your problem if you can withstand a rise of

21:38.880 --> 21:44.480
sea level of 10 feet in six hours then you're probably going to be okay but if you can't then

21:44.480 --> 21:48.160
a hurricane can really cause problems and so we just have more exposure to that kind of

21:48.240 --> 21:54.320
this situation now than we've had before what about the trend with sea level rise

21:56.640 --> 22:01.840
should we be worried about future generations having to deal with issues that might not affect us

22:01.840 --> 22:08.400
in our lifetime but eventually we'll threaten their lives I think your listeners would you know

22:08.400 --> 22:15.680
need to understand that sea level is a dynamic variable it goes up it goes down it has been

22:15.680 --> 22:22.640
over a hundred meters lower than today just in the last 25,000 years and there was a period

22:22.640 --> 22:27.920
from about 15,000 years ago to 8,000 years ago where the sea level rose

22:30.320 --> 22:41.200
you know about 12 centimeters per decade for you know 7,000 years now that's a lot more than

22:41.200 --> 22:47.360
two and a half centimeters per decade as it's doing now so the world has managed to deal with

22:47.360 --> 22:54.800
sea level before and if we go back to the last warm period about 130,000 years ago the sea level

22:54.800 --> 23:01.360
then was higher than it is now by about five meters or so and so just naturally we would expect at

23:01.360 --> 23:06.400
least another five meters of sea level it won't happen tomorrow it won't happen this century but

23:06.480 --> 23:14.080
slowly it will likely continue to rise and so that should be placed in your thinking if you're

23:14.080 --> 23:20.400
building a dock for say a military port or something if you want it to last a long time just put a

23:20.400 --> 23:27.520
cushion in there a way to manage to handle another half meter of sea level rise in the next hundred

23:27.520 --> 23:33.360
years and you should be okay your temperature records

23:35.920 --> 23:38.960
but how much has the earth warmed

23:41.120 --> 23:47.200
let's say over the last 40 years yes we have about I think with this November

23:47.760 --> 23:56.080
we finished 43 years 43 years of measurements and in that time the temperature has risen

23:56.080 --> 24:03.680
half degree Celsius and you might want to look at other things about the world the world has

24:04.240 --> 24:11.200
expanded agricultural production tremendously nations are now exporting grain where they had

24:11.200 --> 24:15.440
before because people are pretty smart they figure out how to do things better all the time

24:15.440 --> 24:21.120
and growing food is one thing they figured out how to do better as time has gone on so the climate

24:21.120 --> 24:29.600
has not been a this warming of a half degree has not been anything that caused a major catastrophe

24:29.600 --> 24:37.840
at all wealth has increased around the planet now some governments are trying to prevent you from

24:38.800 --> 24:45.600
growing your wealth but it that's a hard thing to stop people like to have food they like to have

24:45.600 --> 24:50.720
conveniences in their life and that's hard to you know pass laws that say you can't enjoy the

24:50.720 --> 25:01.600
life of what you want to how much of that warming are you reliably able to say is as a result of

25:01.600 --> 25:11.680
human activity okay the answer is none in the sense you said reliably and I can't come up with an

25:11.680 --> 25:20.160
answer for reliably the work we have done that just assumes all of the warming is that warming that

25:20.160 --> 25:26.080
is not due to El Nino or warming that's not due to volcanic suppression of temperatures earlier in

25:26.080 --> 25:34.320
the record comes up to about a tenth of a degree per decade if it's not due to human activity

25:34.320 --> 25:41.360
reliably let's say are there other factors that we can say for sure let's say geothermal cooling

25:41.920 --> 25:49.920
heating those kinds of things that we can say for a fact have played a role in the incremental

25:50.560 --> 25:56.400
warming of the planet over the last few decades yeah what we see is that we've had a couple of

25:56.400 --> 26:03.040
volcanoes in the first half of that period algae chone and penitubo and those cool the planet in the

26:03.040 --> 26:10.720
first half of that 40 years and so that tilted the trend up so if you add the warming early back

26:10.720 --> 26:15.120
in then that trip tends to tilt the trend a little back down and that's where I come up with a one

26:15.120 --> 26:21.680
tenth per decade is the warming rate which means the climate is not very sensitive to carbon dioxide

26:21.680 --> 26:28.720
or greenhouse gas warming as the popular ideas about it are it's probably half or even less

26:29.280 --> 26:36.640
but about half as sensitive as models tend to report so if CO2

26:38.960 --> 26:43.600
exposure or insertion into the atmosphere were to double what would the results be

26:44.480 --> 26:49.760
okay well I actually had a little paper on that and we're kind of expecting maybe about

26:49.840 --> 26:58.320
2070 2080 it will be doubled from what it was back in 1850 and the warming of that amount

26:59.280 --> 27:07.280
will be about a degree 1.3 I think is what I calculated but that was from that earlier period

27:07.280 --> 27:15.760
so you would say that much of the warming was due to humans about 1.3 degrees C and the general rule

27:15.760 --> 27:22.000
I found with people is they don't mind an extra degree on their temperature in fact if you look at

27:22.000 --> 27:28.400
the United States the average American experiences a much warmer temperature now than they did 100

27:28.400 --> 27:34.880
years ago and that's because the average American has moved south the average American has moved to

27:34.880 --> 27:41.760
much warmer climates California Arizona Texas you know Alabama Florida and so on because cold is

27:41.760 --> 27:46.960
not a whole lot of fun you know seeing and snowmobiling and ice fishing and so on that's fine

27:46.960 --> 27:53.280
but the average person likes it to be warm and so that's why the many people in our millions in

27:53.280 --> 28:01.200
our country have moved to warmer areas and so I don't think that one 1.3 Kelvin whatever I said

28:01.920 --> 28:06.720
it's going to matter much in terms of the weather people really care about those extreme events and

28:06.720 --> 28:17.920
so on what do your temperature records tell you about previous hotter temperatures since what was

28:17.920 --> 28:26.080
it 1978 what we see you know there is an upward trend in the in the global temperature that I think

28:26.080 --> 28:38.080
is manageable but it goes up and down the 1998 El Nino was a big event 2016 El Nino was a big event

28:38.080 --> 28:43.040
so we see these ups but we also see the downs that come from a volcano that might go off and

28:43.040 --> 28:50.640
cools the planet those are bigger effects than that small trend that's going up the global

28:50.640 --> 28:57.120
temperature can change by two tenths of a degree from month to month and so when we're talking about

28:57.120 --> 29:03.600
a tenth per decade then we're talking about you know a month a month we can handle and we can't

29:03.600 --> 29:09.680
handle 20 years worth of a small change just doesn't make sense and and the evidence of the real

29:09.680 --> 29:15.600
world is pretty clear that humans have done extremely well as the planet has been warming a little

29:15.600 --> 29:24.320
bit whether it's natural or not what can you tell me about the Milankovitch cycles Milankovitch

29:24.320 --> 29:31.600
cycles are the orbital cycles of the earth the earth orbit around the sun and it's tilt of the axis

29:31.600 --> 29:37.440
and the distance from the sun that that is not a perfect circular orbit around the sun it's kind

29:37.440 --> 29:44.160
of an ellipse and it changes through time and all those factors work together to put a little bit

29:44.160 --> 29:50.960
more solar energy in certain places and less than others and what we talk about in ice ages

29:51.680 --> 29:58.800
which uh these cycles are likely related to is that if you can melt the snow in Canada

29:59.360 --> 30:04.960
in the summer then you won't have an ice age so the snow falls in the winter you melt it in the

30:04.960 --> 30:11.440
summer no ice age if you can't melt the snow in Canada in the summer for some reason the

30:11.440 --> 30:19.440
earth is tilted away a bit in July and August and so on and the snow hangs around all summer long

30:19.440 --> 30:25.360
the next winter more snow piles up the next summer it doesn't melt the next winter more snow

30:25.360 --> 30:31.120
so you get this mechanism that adds snow and then you come up with an ice age and so the tilt

30:31.120 --> 30:38.400
of the axis and other parameters I just mentioned can moderate how much sunlight comes in in the

30:38.400 --> 30:45.600
summertime in Canada and it's up to 100 watts per meter squared which is a a lot of energy

30:46.720 --> 30:52.560
difference over time and that's probably the biggest theory that has a pretty good amount of

30:52.560 --> 30:58.720
evidence with it that those orbital changes can cause huge changes in the climate from ice age to

30:58.720 --> 31:09.360
the current uh intercalation when I spoke to dr curry she said in the long term uh negligible

31:10.320 --> 31:16.240
influence that humans have on the planet but what we seem to forget is that the climate's

31:16.240 --> 31:23.040
going to do what the climate's going to do do you conquer uh yes you just mentioned the ice ages

31:23.040 --> 31:28.000
but those are huge swings in the climate that the humans of course didn't have anything to do with so

31:29.200 --> 31:38.160
maybe if if your listeners thought about it this way that the sun sends down on average about 160

31:38.160 --> 31:45.360
watts per meter square 160 the atmosphere itself sends down about 340 so you know heat comes from

31:45.360 --> 31:50.400
the atmosphere above us that's 500 watts per meter square when you add it together so you're

31:50.400 --> 31:55.840
looking up about 500 watts are coming down on average for the globe the extra carbon dioxide

31:55.840 --> 32:02.960
and so on is about two watts so you can see that this 500 watts that's natural and it can go up and

32:02.960 --> 32:08.480
down and vary and so on the extra two is not going to have much effect that's why it's hard

32:08.480 --> 32:14.960
we're trying to find what is the impact of that extra two watts per meter squared and it's pretty

32:14.960 --> 32:21.760
tough it might be found in the in the oceans is a little bit more jewels of energy going into the

32:21.760 --> 32:27.520
oceans than before but was that due to just a change in clouds that was natural or is it due

32:27.520 --> 32:32.720
to the extra carbon dioxide now extra carbon dioxide does send down that two watts i'm not

32:32.720 --> 32:39.760
saying it doesn't uh but the atmosphere and the ocean can respond and release a lot of that extra

32:39.760 --> 32:44.400
two watts and evidently that's what's happening because the earth isn't warming up as much as the

32:44.400 --> 32:55.200
models that suggest there's claims that the way that humans are living is causing daily extinction

32:55.200 --> 33:06.640
of two to three hundred different species is this a natural course of evolution you know 99%

33:06.640 --> 33:13.360
of the species that have ever lived are extinct so extinction is pretty natural obviously

33:13.360 --> 33:18.240
have humans caused some extinctions well certainly you know when you destroy the environment of a

33:18.240 --> 33:24.080
small place and that was the only place that particular species live then yes you know humans

33:24.080 --> 33:30.800
caused that extinction did the climate change that humans caused cause any extinctions i think

33:30.800 --> 33:38.480
that jury is still out uh because most uh species love the extra carbon dioxide plants do specifically

33:38.480 --> 33:43.440
and then everything that eats plants loves that so you might want to say the extra carbon dioxide

33:43.440 --> 33:51.760
actually helped in some sense the whole biosphere but i think that what humans do to the surface

33:51.760 --> 33:59.680
and to the water if it's not clean properly and if you just really poison the surface in the air

33:59.680 --> 34:04.960
then that can cause some real problems for the species that are living out there and that's why

34:04.960 --> 34:14.000
we have rules about making not putting poison in the air or in the water does that qualify as climate

34:14.000 --> 34:22.720
change no no uh to say carbon dioxide is a poison is you know you really have to scratch your head

34:22.720 --> 34:31.360
on that because plants love the stuff it invigorates the biosphere um when did all of this greenery

34:31.360 --> 34:39.040
evolve and the corals you know occur and grow and develop it occurred when there was two to four

34:39.040 --> 34:46.880
times five times as much CO2 as that is in the air now so carbon dioxide invigorates the biosphere

34:47.600 --> 34:53.280
so we're just actually putting back carbon dioxide that had been in the atmosphere earlier and uh i

34:53.280 --> 34:58.720
don't think the world is going to have too much problem that in terms of its biosphere uh the

34:58.720 --> 35:05.680
issue about is climate going to become so bad that some things can't handle it and i don't really see

35:05.680 --> 35:11.200
the evidence for that happening critics of your views on climate have argued that you

35:11.200 --> 35:18.800
undercut your credibility by making claims for that exceed your data and that you're unwilling to

35:19.120 --> 35:31.680
agree with different findings how do you respond to that uh show me a finding and and let me look at

35:31.680 --> 35:38.480
it and uh if it's a valid finding fine i'll agree with it uh but uh you know you can find anything on

35:38.480 --> 35:44.720
the web these days about claims that uh someone might make but you show me the evidence let me see

35:44.720 --> 35:51.760
what you're complaining about and uh we can have a discussion about that but i what my publication

35:51.760 --> 35:57.760
show i just had one published last week on snowfall in the western states of the united states that

35:57.760 --> 36:03.200
shows for the main snowfall regions there is no trend in snowfall the amount of snow that's falling

36:03.200 --> 36:09.360
right now is the same as it was 120 years ago so snowfall is still falling out in the western

36:09.360 --> 36:15.120
mountains of the united states that's evidence that this data and so when someone has a claim that

36:15.120 --> 36:20.720
oh snowfall is going away out in the west i said well well here look at these the evidence from

36:20.720 --> 36:27.840
real station data that people recorded back in 1890 to now and uh and so i can answer that question

36:27.840 --> 36:33.680
with real information and and you don't see many of people like me in debates because they're not

36:33.680 --> 36:40.880
offered uh in fact i've been uninvited you know someone on a particular panel would say hey let's

36:40.880 --> 36:47.520
get this guy to come here and speak to us and then i receive the the de-invitation because it was

36:47.520 --> 36:55.200
not going to go along with the theme of their climate change as a catastrophe uh presentation

36:58.000 --> 37:02.560
on those occasions that you referred to in the past that co2 levels were significantly

37:02.560 --> 37:15.760
higher than they are now do records show any negative effects as a result of such high co2

37:17.040 --> 37:22.720
well when you say negative you're that's almost a moral question good or bad that the dinosaurs

37:22.720 --> 37:28.400
went extinct well as the dinosaurs and i think they did have an opinion about that um

37:28.720 --> 37:38.160
well let me rephrase if it had to be on those levels today would negatively impact

37:39.280 --> 37:45.360
that will mentally impact humanity okay what we see is um

37:47.600 --> 37:52.320
as carbon dioxide event has increased in other words humans are producing energy

37:53.280 --> 38:00.400
so that their lives can be uh enhanced i mean there is a direct relationship between how much

38:00.400 --> 38:06.880
carbon or energy you're able to use and carbon is the main source today and your thrive ability

38:07.920 --> 38:14.800
it's basically one to one you know think about it we didn't leave the stone age because we ran out

38:14.800 --> 38:21.920
of rocks you have the stone age because something better came along you know iron bronze and so on

38:23.040 --> 38:30.560
and in terms of energy we didn't leave the wood and dung age because we ran out of trees or excrement

38:31.520 --> 38:38.720
we found a better source than was carbon coal oil and so on and transportation you know we didn't

38:38.720 --> 38:46.160
leave the horse and buggy age because we ran out of horses it's because Henry Ford made a vehicle

38:46.160 --> 38:52.080
that was cheap and affordable my great grandfather who was a destitute poverty in oklahoma in the 1930s

38:52.640 --> 38:59.840
had a Model T and so uh and another thing about Henry Ford he didn't go around getting the government

38:59.840 --> 39:05.600
to kill all the horses so you'd only have to buy his car horses were still available for the poorest

39:05.600 --> 39:11.280
people you know and the government didn't uh he didn't make the government go out and build gas

39:11.280 --> 39:16.240
stations or drill for oil you know that was done at the market for the private level but today we

39:16.240 --> 39:21.600
have a government that says this is what i want for the energy structure and so we're going to be uh

39:21.600 --> 39:26.800
uh using your taxpayer money and we're going to put out all these charging stations and force you

39:26.800 --> 39:31.280
to buy electric cars or at least subsidize them tremendously and put up all these windmills and

39:31.280 --> 39:39.120
so on uh at great expense and great environmental wreckage and i can assure you that without energy

39:39.120 --> 39:45.920
life is brutal and short and so energy is the thing that has caused uh our life spans to double

39:46.560 --> 39:54.480
and so children no longer fear about or we don't have to fear for uh diseases that used to wipe out

39:55.120 --> 40:01.280
millions because of the advances that energy has brought out through electricity and experimentation

40:01.280 --> 40:06.000
and all the sciences that we have developed now that's based upon that access to energy

40:07.760 --> 40:15.360
and so yes uh developing countries and and here's my i mean i'm not making this as a prediction

40:15.360 --> 40:22.000
i'm just using this as an observation they're going to get their energy they are going to find

40:22.000 --> 40:27.600
the energy and right now it's carbon that's the cheapest and most effective and very high density

40:27.600 --> 40:34.000
and so we will see these countries use carbon to advance and we should not stand in their way

40:34.000 --> 40:40.480
because they want to live like us who already have pretty big carbon footprints uh but if you

40:40.480 --> 40:46.960
want to have some comfort in that is uh the carbon dioxide we're putting back into the atmosphere

40:46.960 --> 40:54.560
is invigorating the biosphere and it also represents people living longer and better

40:54.560 --> 41:01.120
lives there's just no question that is energy is made available and affordable people live longer

41:01.120 --> 41:09.120
and better lives and uh i think that's going to ultimately be the the inertia that's going to carry

41:09.120 --> 41:16.960
forward this uh issue kind of past all the preaching about carbon dioxide problems

41:17.840 --> 41:24.480
environmentalists would argue that they're not against electricity and prosperity

41:24.480 --> 41:29.760
they're just advocating for a better cleaner way to do it it's a tremendous misconception

41:30.400 --> 41:36.720
that a windmill or a solar panel can somehow give you cleaner and reliable energy than what you have

41:36.720 --> 41:42.720
now that's just not true to build a windmill the environmental wreckage that you have to go through

41:42.720 --> 41:48.240
is tremendous in terms of all the minerals you have to yank out of the earth and process

41:48.880 --> 41:54.400
process takes energy by the way and building all these transmission lines i mean the energy is so

41:54.400 --> 42:01.360
diffuse it is so weak in wind and solar that you have to gather up huge amounts of land to

42:01.920 --> 42:08.960
put it together i think uh robert brice said it well i think he called it the iron law of power

42:08.960 --> 42:15.440
something like that that the weaker the source of energy the more stuff and material you need

42:15.440 --> 42:22.000
to gather it to concentrate it to make it useful and so you find out you have to spend huge amounts

42:22.000 --> 42:28.640
of dollars in environmental cost to make a windmill or make a solar panel which by the way

42:28.640 --> 42:36.400
doesn't last forever and uh and so this carbon that already has a tremendous amount of energy

42:36.400 --> 42:42.480
in a very small dense space means that the environmental footprint is much much smaller

42:42.480 --> 42:49.600
than what you have with a solar or wind in fact i like you know it's about one to a thousand or

42:49.600 --> 42:56.000
two thousand in terms of the square footage you need and i like to tell people you know i i ran

42:56.000 --> 43:00.560
five miles this morning so and there was a little bit of wind it was cloudy so if you had a solar

43:00.560 --> 43:07.600
panel it would have helped you anyway but think about sun and wind you can go out and enjoy them

43:08.240 --> 43:14.240
the breeze which tells you they don't have much energy if they don't you know bring you great

43:14.240 --> 43:21.520
harm this wind is so energy poor that you can stand out in the wind not be bothered you can stand out

43:21.520 --> 43:27.040
in the sun and not be bothered but go try to stand in the boiler of a natural gas fire power plant

43:27.040 --> 43:32.640
you'd be burnt to a crisp that's the kind of energy you need to push electrons and that's the

43:32.640 --> 43:39.600
amount of energy that can be done or that process can be done in a very small environmental footprint

43:39.600 --> 43:46.720
that then allows the rest of the environment to to not be interfered with by this energy production

43:46.720 --> 43:53.440
but look at windmill and solar panel farms not only are they just ugly but they do cause

43:53.440 --> 43:58.320
tremendous environmental damage in their construction and maintenance

44:00.960 --> 44:05.280
what are the long-term effects i'm talking decades from now

44:06.720 --> 44:12.800
if we just continue to get our energy from fossil fuels how bad can it get

44:12.960 --> 44:20.400
well let me start how good can you talk about people that will have access to affordable energy

44:20.400 --> 44:24.480
so they're going to live longer and they're going to live better lives you have access to this

44:25.120 --> 44:31.360
the impact on the climate i think is what is about the only thing you think of is uh well the sea

44:31.360 --> 44:35.600
level is going to continue to rise has been rising for several hundred years so it's it's going to

44:35.600 --> 44:43.520
continue to rise and at a manageable rate by the way um and the atmosphere it might warm

44:43.520 --> 44:52.400
some more uh but certainly not in terms of that catastrophic effect that will cause us to

44:53.840 --> 45:02.800
lose our ability to thrive i'm just very i'm pretty optimistic you know people are clever

45:02.800 --> 45:06.320
and they can figure out how to adapt to whatever is going to happen

45:07.040 --> 45:11.520
the real issues i deal with as a state climatologists are the extreme events

45:11.520 --> 45:18.080
that we know are going to happen that you're not ready for i mean that flood that happened

45:18.080 --> 45:23.440
you know 50 years ago is going to come back again and it's going to cause some real problems

45:23.440 --> 45:28.640
if you don't build your infrastructure and put your houses where they can be safe

45:28.640 --> 45:33.680
or industry uh if you don't build up on the coast too much so that you won't be clobbered

45:33.680 --> 45:39.200
by a hurricane or something like that so it's these kind of natural extreme events that we're

45:39.200 --> 45:44.880
far more vulnerable to right now than some small and gradual change that the climate system might

45:44.880 --> 45:52.960
undergo i did read somewhere that someone has asked you and i'm sure you must get it a lot

45:52.960 --> 45:56.800
whether you get any funding from the fossil fuel industry do you

45:57.840 --> 46:06.000
no i do not and i made that decision way back in the 19 early 1990s so that uh you know someone

46:06.000 --> 46:11.840
can come to me and and a fossil fuel i might make a fossil fuel company mad by some of

46:12.800 --> 46:19.440
information i've produced but so be it if i can then put my head to bed at night and not be worried

46:19.440 --> 46:26.400
about did i uh accommodate some agenda somewhere i'm just after what the observations say can i

46:26.400 --> 46:31.920
build the best observational data set to answer the questions of climate that we have and uh and

46:31.920 --> 46:37.680
that's that's what i want to do i suppose one of the biggest tragedies about it would be that it

46:37.680 --> 46:43.840
would discredit the real science and the the fundamental research that you're doing just

46:43.840 --> 46:49.040
that it'll be a non-starter because people will immediately just yeah and that's unfortunate

46:49.040 --> 46:55.040
because the perception then is that well if a fossil fuel company paid someone to do some

46:55.040 --> 46:59.840
research they really wanted to know the answer about something and this person was completely

46:59.840 --> 47:06.560
honest did the work properly and provided the answer to the fossil fuel companies is as you said

47:06.560 --> 47:13.520
is well that answer would be tainted because it came from a fossil fuel company well hello think

47:13.520 --> 47:20.000
about what environmental advocacy groups and pressure groups do all of the time they pay

47:20.000 --> 47:29.120
tremendous sums to people so they can come up with an answer that gives them their leverage in

47:29.120 --> 47:36.000
claiming this is a catastrophic problem but so i can take that at least perception off the table

47:36.640 --> 47:42.720
lastly are you aware of any ways in which geoengineering could possibly be affecting

47:43.360 --> 47:50.000
the natural balance of things is it being done more than we're aware of

47:51.520 --> 47:56.640
and could it backfire anytime humans do something they're going to have an impact

47:57.520 --> 48:01.760
there's just no question about that so you could call that geoengineering but inadvertent

48:02.320 --> 48:10.160
we have made some desert valleys cooler because now we irrigate crops so we've

48:11.040 --> 48:17.440
you know taken water that fell someplace and moved it to another place and so that's a bit

48:17.440 --> 48:24.400
of geoengineering there and that by the way a lot of those places feed a lot of the world so

48:24.400 --> 48:31.600
you can't say it's bad i suppose but the other question about geoengineering is can we do something

48:31.600 --> 48:38.000
to prevent a perceived problem here and that's the real danger i think because you don't know the

48:38.000 --> 48:43.920
consequences of when you start tinkering with a very complex and dynamical system and so i would

48:43.920 --> 48:53.040
say stay away from that suppose someone did a big geo geoengineering experiment and it was and

48:53.040 --> 48:58.960
something bad happened somewhere well that country would sue the world and say look you made this

48:58.960 --> 49:04.000
bad thing happen to us you are liable and so then we're getting nowhere in terms of

49:04.720 --> 49:10.800
preventing some problem on the planet
