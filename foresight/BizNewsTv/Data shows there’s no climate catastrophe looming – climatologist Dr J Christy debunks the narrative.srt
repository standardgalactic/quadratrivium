00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
I'm Najja Swat for business.com and joining me today is Dr. John Christie, climate scientist at

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,200
the University of Alabama in Huntsville and Alabama state climatologist since 2000. Dr. Christie,

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,720
thank you so much for your time. My pleasure. You've described yourself as a climate nerd

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,520
and apparently you were 12 when your unwaving desire to understand whether and climate started.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:36,080
Why climate? Well, I was, I think it was more like 10 years old when I was fascinated with

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,520
some unusual weather events that happened in my home area of California and so that began a

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,000
fascination for me and I wanted to try to figure out why things happened the way they did. Why

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,520
did one year have more rain? That's a big story in California. Does it rain or not? And another year

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,920
would be very dry. Why were the mountains covered with snow in one April and not another? In fact,

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:13,120
I have here April 1967 that I recorded as a teenager. So this has been a passion of mine forever and

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,560
as it turns out now that I'm as old as I am, I still can't figure out why one year is wetter

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:28,240
than the other. Well, you seem to be getting a lot closer than most people. I think it was in 1989

13
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:37,520
when you and NASA scientist Roy Spencer pioneered a new method of measuring monitoring temperature

14
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:46,320
records via satellites. Since that time up until now, why did you feel you needed to develop a

15
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,760
new method to begin with and how did it differ in terms of the readings of established methods at

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:02,400
the time? Well, the issue was we only had surface temperature measurements and they are scattered

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,720
over the world. They don't cover much of the world at all actually, mainly just the land regions

18
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:13,360
and scattered places on the ocean. The measurement itself is not that robust. The stations move,

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,120
the instruments change through time and so it's a very difficult thing to make. In fact,

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,280
a small little change in the area right around the station can really affect the temperature

21
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,880
of that station. So Roy Spencer and Dick McKnighter came up with an idea about looking at some

22
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,520
satellite data and this is the temperature of the deep layer of the atmosphere. So this is like the

23
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:45,200
surface to 8,000 meters, you know, something like that and so if we could see the temperature of that

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,320
bulk atmospheric layer, we would have a very robust measurement and the microwave sensors on the

25
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,560
NOAA polo orbiting satellites did precisely that and so we were the first to really put those data

26
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:09,280
into a simple data set that had the temperature then for month by month since about November 1978.

27
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,480
Okay and how did your readings differ from the climate science at the time?

28
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,760
Well, first of all, they differ because we had a global measurement. We really did see the entire

29
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,960
globe from satellite because the orbit of that satellite is polar and the earth spins around

30
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,680
underneath so every day we have 14 orbits that the earth spins around underneath and we see the

31
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,760
entire planet so that's one big difference and the other one is that the actual result did not

32
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,680
show as much warming as what the surface temperatures showed and we're doing even more work now to

33
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:53,760
demonstrate that a lot of the surface stations are spuriously affected by the growth of an

34
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,760
infrastructure around them and so there's kind of a false warming signal there.

35
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,920
You don't get the background climate signal with surface temperature measurements, you get

36
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,960
a bit of what's happening in the local area.

37
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:17,360
Well, your research has to do with testing the theories posited by climate model forecasts

38
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:25,840
so you don't actually do any modeling yourself but what criteria do you use to test these theories?

39
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,520
That's a very good question because in climate you hear all kinds of claims and theories being

40
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,680
thrown out there and for a lot of people who don't really understand the climate system it's a

41
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,120
quick and easy answer just to say oh humans caused that you know global warming or something like

42
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,080
that is the answer when the climate system is very complex so we look at these claims

43
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,960
and Roy Spencer and I when I say we are just a few of the people around the world that actually

44
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,680
build data sets from scratch. I mean we start with the photon counts of the satellite radiometers

45
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:12,000
or the you know the original paper records of 19th century East Africa. We do all this from scratch

46
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,080
and so that we can test the claims that people make and what we find is that once we build the

47
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,160
data set we make sure we have confidence in the data set that it's telling us a truth about what's

48
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:32,080
happening over time we can determine that as well or test it then we check the claim. So for

49
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,880
example on surface temperature data sets that we make that go back to the 19th century someone will

50
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,440
say well this is the hottest decade or more records happened this decade than in the past and we can

51
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,160
demonstrate in the United States especially that that's not the case that you would need to go back

52
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,280
to the 1930s if you want to see real record temperatures that occurred at that time and for

53
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:03,840
climate models we like to use the satellite data set it's a robust deep layer measurement so it's

54
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,880
measuring lots of mass of the atmosphere the heat content really and so that's a direct value we can

55
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,320
get out of the climate models so we are comparing what we say apples to apples what the satellite

56
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,560
produces and observes is what the climate model also generates and we can compare them one to one

57
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,440
and in the paper Ross McKintock and I wrote a couple of years ago we found that 100% of the

58
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,840
climate models were warming the atmosphere faster than it was actually warming so that's not a good

59
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,600
result if you're trying to test your theory of how the climate works with a model against what

60
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:50,160
actually happens with the models how much do you think of the deeply over exaggerated

61
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,080
predictions that doom and gloom have to do with the fact that the methodology is

62
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,120
it's substantiated by confirmation bias well you know that that's an interesting question because

63
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,240
we're a bit confused as well is we have been publishing these papers since 1994 that have

64
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,600
demonstrated models warm too much relative to the actual climate and yet we don't see an improvement

65
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:25,120
in climate models and trying to match reality with their model output now I think a number of

66
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:33,200
modelers understand that yes there is a difference there and it's the models are just too hot but

67
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,480
what is the process that's gone wrong in the models to make that is a difficult question for

68
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:46,400
these folks because models have hundreds of places you could turn a little knob change a coefficient

69
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,200
and that will change the result now it's not a physical thing it's not based on physics it's

70
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,160
it's the model parameterizations we call them the little pieces of the model that try to represent

71
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,760
an actual part of the atmosphere like when do clouds form that's a pretty big question is

72
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,960
how much humidity in the atmosphere is required to create a cloud because once the cloud forms

73
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,360
that reflects sunlight and cools the earth so that's it that's one of the big questions there is

74
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:26,560
so in testing the models we like to use the bulk atmospheric temperature that's a very direct

75
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,000
measurement that models produce in the atmosphere produce and so we can then say there's a problem

76
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,760
here with climate models to what degree the dual observations data differ from their forecasts

77
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:51,600
well generally it's about a factor of two at times it's been more but the latest models on

78
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,200
average the models for the deep layer of the atmosphere are warming about twice too fast

79
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,800
and that's a real problem I think when now we're looking at over 40 years what we can test these

80
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,880
models with and they're already that far off and so I will we should not use them to to tell us

81
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,320
what's going to happen in the future since they haven't even gotten us to the right place in the

82
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:26,880
last four years but given that your real world data it's refuted what the forecasts were every

83
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:38,240
time for decades why then and I recognize that this is conjecture we can't really be sure but on

84
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:47,440
let's say 97 99 percent of scientists so firmly behind the climate crisis narrative

85
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,400
yeah I don't know how many are really fully behind that crisis climate narrative I

86
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:02,880
saw a recent survey where about 55 percent might have been of the opinion that the climate warming

87
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,840
was going to be a problem warming itself is not a problem I mean the earth has been warmer in the

88
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:18,320
past than it is today so the earth has survived that before and I don't think putting extra

89
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:26,560
you know plant food in the atmosphere is going to be a real problem for us to overcome I do think

90
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,640
the world is going to warm some from the extra CO2 but there are a lot of benefits that come from

91
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:41,200
that by the way you're dealing with a question about human nature and funding and so on and I

92
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,480
think we all know that the more dramatic a story is especially in the political world

93
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,000
the more attention you will get and therefore your work can be highlighted and that helps you

94
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,840
with funding and attention and so on and that's kind of part of what's going on here then there's

95
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:12,640
the other real stronger political narrative that folks there are groups and in the world

96
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:19,600
political elite that like to have a narrative that scares people so that they can then offer a

97
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:26,800
solution and so simple way to say elect me to this office and I will be able to solve this problem

98
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:34,480
that you are facing people like us who actually produce the data and look at you know extreme

99
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,040
events and so on say well you know there isn't any change in these extreme events so what's the

100
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,560
problem you're trying to solve and then we look at the other side of that issue and say okay if you

101
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,800
actually implement this regulation or this law it's not going to have any make any difference on

102
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,120
the climate anyway so it's a you kind of lose on two ends on that story. You're a distinguished

103
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,120
professor of atmospheric science and also director of earth sciences also at Alabama in Huntsville

104
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:10,720
these are prominent positions how have you managed to hold on to them with climate views

105
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:20,000
that are so divergent from the norm? Well the environment in the state of Alabama is different

106
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,960
than what you have in Washington and as I like to tell people that one of the reasons I like to

107
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,400
live in Alabama and I'm from California way across the country is that in Alabama you can

108
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:40,560
call a duck a duck that you can just be flat on about what's going on and you're not going to be

109
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:49,120
given the evil eye or cast out as it is now in the climate establishment you know saying that all

110
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,080
the models are warming too much and that there is not a disaster arising that causes great consternation

111
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,280
because of the narrative that has been built over the last 30 years that we are supposed to be in a

112
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:07,120
catastrophe and to come out and say well here's the data and the data show there is no catastrophe

113
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:14,160
looming we're doing fine the world is doing fine human life is thriving in places it's allowed to

114
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,480
so what's the problem here you're trying to solve? Did you ever manage to get your findings to

115
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,360
policy makers that have interest to do something about it? Well you know I've been

116
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:37,040
to Congress 20 times testified before hearings so the information is there and available

117
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:47,200
but I can't force Congress to make legislation that matches the real world the congressional world

118
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,080
is a political world and things happen there that are kind of out of my reach and ability to influence

119
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:01,200
I suppose. According to your research you've also said that the climate models underestimate

120
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:08,480
negative feedback loops so can you explain to me what this mechanism is and the effect of

121
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,840
overestimation of the loops on understanding climate for what it is? All right now that's a

122
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,680
very complicated issue and I don't understand it all for sure but we can say just from some

123
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,920
general results in general observation what's going on here and one of those general observation is

124
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:37,680
that when a climate model warms up the atmosphere one Kelvin one degree that it sends out 1.4 watts

125
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:47,040
per meter squared so the air atmosphere warms up and energy escapes to space 1.4 when we use

126
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,520
actual observations of the atmosphere when the real atmosphere warms up one Kelvin it sends out

127
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:00,800
2.6 watts of energy almost twice as much so that tells you right there that the climate models are

128
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:08,800
retaining or holding on to energy that the real world allows to escape when it warms so that's

129
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,720
kind of a negative feedback that as the atmosphere warms for a bit the real world knows how to let

130
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,720
that heat escape whereas the models don't and they retain it and that's why they keep building up heat

131
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:28,880
over time. What other variables do you look at? Yeah the state climatologists I deal a lot with

132
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,240
very practical questions that people ask they want them is it getting hotter is it getting

133
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,240
wetter are the rainstorms getting heavier and so are the hurricanes getting worse and so I actually

134
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:47,280
wrote a booklet called I practical guide to climate change in Alabama but it covers a lot of the

135
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,320
country as well so it's not just this it's free you can download it from my website

136
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,360
the Alabama state climatologist is on the first page and I answer a lot of these very practical

137
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:09,040
questions and one as we go down the list there aren't any more droughts droughts are not getting

138
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:16,480
worse over time heavy rainstorms are not getting worse over time here in the southeast in fact

139
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,840
Ross McKittrick and I also had a paper on that where we went back to 1878 and demonstrated that

140
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:28,640
the trends are not significant hurricanes no they're not going up at all in fact 2022 is going to be

141
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:35,840
one of the quietest that we've had in a while tornadoes are not becoming more numerous heat

142
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:42,640
waves are not becoming worse so one after another though the weather that people really care about

143
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:50,160
that if it changes could cause problem or catastrophe we find those events are not changing

144
00:16:50,160 --> 00:17:02,560
they've always been around some of the biggest critics of climate skeptics say okay yes no fair

145
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:12,080
one extreme weather event doesn't say much but they argue that they are very particular trends

146
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:20,160
that have been on the increase like recently have you observed this at all that's exactly

147
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:27,600
the kind of thing we build data sets to discover for example there is a story and there is some

148
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,840
evidence for it that in the last hundred years there's been an increase in in heavy rain events

149
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,160
in part of our country not all of it just part of the country so I built a data set that went back

150
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,560
to the 1870s in fact it back to the 1860s and so on and we looked at that very carefully and found

151
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:54,240
that well when you go back far enough there were a lot of heavy events back then and so over the

152
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:03,920
long time period of 140 years or more we don't see an upward trend that's unusual in that sample of

153
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:12,480
time 140 years that we don't see a change in those kind of events so that's why you know one of the

154
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,440
real things I think has great value to it is to build these data sets so you can specifically

155
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,240
answer the question and the claim that is being made I think one of the worst ones was made by

156
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,240
the New York Times when they were talking about how many record high temperatures occurred in a

157
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,800
recent heatwave around the country and so I looked at that a little bit more carefully and they were

158
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:46,800
allowing stations to be included that only had 30 years or less of data even less than 30 years

159
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,960
so some had 100 years but a lot of them just had 30 years well when you become very systematic and

160
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,800
say okay I'm only going to allow stations that have 100 years so that every station that measured

161
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,960
in 2022 can be compared with the entire time series and then their story falls apart because

162
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,760
the 30s and the 50s were so hot in our country that they still hold the records for the number

163
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:18,160
of high temperature events just the scary thing for me is that as much as it completely falls

164
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:25,920
apart there's no logic to it it still firmly stands as what most people believe you have to

165
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:32,240
give credit to those who in the climate establishment and the media or whoever is behind all this that

166
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,800
they have been successful in scaring people about the climate because now you find that even in

167
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:47,200
grade school textbooks and almost every new story that comes out will try to throw in and this is

168
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,600
where this establishment is very good is they make sure every story has some kind of line in it about

169
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,840
climate change and they don't ever go back and talk to someone who actually builds these data

170
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,840
set sentences is that really the worst it's been in the last 120 years they just make those claims

171
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:14,160
and so other than the fact the sea level is rising a bit the extreme events are just not

172
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:24,800
there to really cause problems now we are in a problem of having greater damages occur because

173
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:30,880
of extreme events and that's mainly because we've just built so much more stuff and placed it in harm's

174
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:40,320
way our coastlines are crowded with condominiums and uh entertainment parks and uh retirement

175
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,960
villages and so on there's so many more of them that when a hurricane does come well it's going

176
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,640
to wipe out a lot more and so we've served sure the damages the the absolute value of those damages

177
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,960
has gone up but the number of hurricanes their strength and so on the background climate has

178
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,160
not caused that problem it's just that we like to build things in places that are dangerous

179
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,520
we have you know records of sea level rise and it's on the order of about an inch per decade

180
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:14,320
except in places where the land is sinking pretty rapidly and you can find that on the Louisiana

181
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,280
Gulf Coast and in places like that but otherwise it's about an inch per decade and I tell folks

182
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,640
that an inch per decade you know if they want to have centimeters a decade is not your problem

183
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:38,880
it's 10 feet in six hours from the next hurricane that's your problem if you can withstand a rise of

184
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,480
sea level of 10 feet in six hours then you're probably going to be okay but if you can't then

185
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,160
a hurricane can really cause problems and so we just have more exposure to that kind of

186
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,320
this situation now than we've had before what about the trend with sea level rise

187
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,840
should we be worried about future generations having to deal with issues that might not affect us

188
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,400
in our lifetime but eventually we'll threaten their lives I think your listeners would you know

189
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,680
need to understand that sea level is a dynamic variable it goes up it goes down it has been

190
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:22,640
over a hundred meters lower than today just in the last 25,000 years and there was a period

191
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,920
from about 15,000 years ago to 8,000 years ago where the sea level rose

192
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:41,200
you know about 12 centimeters per decade for you know 7,000 years now that's a lot more than

193
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,360
two and a half centimeters per decade as it's doing now so the world has managed to deal with

194
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:54,800
sea level before and if we go back to the last warm period about 130,000 years ago the sea level

195
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,360
then was higher than it is now by about five meters or so and so just naturally we would expect at

196
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,400
least another five meters of sea level it won't happen tomorrow it won't happen this century but

197
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:14,080
slowly it will likely continue to rise and so that should be placed in your thinking if you're

198
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,400
building a dock for say a military port or something if you want it to last a long time just put a

199
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,520
cushion in there a way to manage to handle another half meter of sea level rise in the next hundred

200
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,360
years and you should be okay your temperature records

201
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,960
but how much has the earth warmed

202
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,200
let's say over the last 40 years yes we have about I think with this November

203
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:56,080
we finished 43 years 43 years of measurements and in that time the temperature has risen

204
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,680
half degree Celsius and you might want to look at other things about the world the world has

205
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:11,200
expanded agricultural production tremendously nations are now exporting grain where they had

206
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,440
before because people are pretty smart they figure out how to do things better all the time

207
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,120
and growing food is one thing they figured out how to do better as time has gone on so the climate

208
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:29,600
has not been a this warming of a half degree has not been anything that caused a major catastrophe

209
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:37,840
at all wealth has increased around the planet now some governments are trying to prevent you from

210
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:45,600
growing your wealth but it that's a hard thing to stop people like to have food they like to have

211
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,720
conveniences in their life and that's hard to you know pass laws that say you can't enjoy the

212
00:24:50,720 --> 00:25:01,600
life of what you want to how much of that warming are you reliably able to say is as a result of

213
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:11,680
human activity okay the answer is none in the sense you said reliably and I can't come up with an

214
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:20,160
answer for reliably the work we have done that just assumes all of the warming is that warming that

215
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:26,080
is not due to El Nino or warming that's not due to volcanic suppression of temperatures earlier in

216
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:34,320
the record comes up to about a tenth of a degree per decade if it's not due to human activity

217
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:41,360
reliably let's say are there other factors that we can say for sure let's say geothermal cooling

218
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:49,920
heating those kinds of things that we can say for a fact have played a role in the incremental

219
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:56,400
warming of the planet over the last few decades yeah what we see is that we've had a couple of

220
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:03,040
volcanoes in the first half of that period algae chone and penitubo and those cool the planet in the

221
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:10,720
first half of that 40 years and so that tilted the trend up so if you add the warming early back

222
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,120
in then that trip tends to tilt the trend a little back down and that's where I come up with a one

223
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,680
tenth per decade is the warming rate which means the climate is not very sensitive to carbon dioxide

224
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:28,720
or greenhouse gas warming as the popular ideas about it are it's probably half or even less

225
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:36,640
but about half as sensitive as models tend to report so if CO2

226
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,600
exposure or insertion into the atmosphere were to double what would the results be

227
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,760
okay well I actually had a little paper on that and we're kind of expecting maybe about

228
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:58,320
2070 2080 it will be doubled from what it was back in 1850 and the warming of that amount

229
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:07,280
will be about a degree 1.3 I think is what I calculated but that was from that earlier period

230
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:15,760
so you would say that much of the warming was due to humans about 1.3 degrees C and the general rule

231
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,000
I found with people is they don't mind an extra degree on their temperature in fact if you look at

232
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,400
the United States the average American experiences a much warmer temperature now than they did 100

233
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:34,880
years ago and that's because the average American has moved south the average American has moved to

234
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,760
much warmer climates California Arizona Texas you know Alabama Florida and so on because cold is

235
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,960
not a whole lot of fun you know seeing and snowmobiling and ice fishing and so on that's fine

236
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,280
but the average person likes it to be warm and so that's why the many people in our millions in

237
00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:01,200
our country have moved to warmer areas and so I don't think that one 1.3 Kelvin whatever I said

238
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,720
it's going to matter much in terms of the weather people really care about those extreme events and

239
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:17,920
so on what do your temperature records tell you about previous hotter temperatures since what was

240
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:26,080
it 1978 what we see you know there is an upward trend in the in the global temperature that I think

241
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:38,080
is manageable but it goes up and down the 1998 El Nino was a big event 2016 El Nino was a big event

242
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,040
so we see these ups but we also see the downs that come from a volcano that might go off and

243
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:50,640
cools the planet those are bigger effects than that small trend that's going up the global

244
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,120
temperature can change by two tenths of a degree from month to month and so when we're talking about

245
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,600
a tenth per decade then we're talking about you know a month a month we can handle and we can't

246
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,680
handle 20 years worth of a small change just doesn't make sense and and the evidence of the real

247
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:15,600
world is pretty clear that humans have done extremely well as the planet has been warming a little

248
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:24,320
bit whether it's natural or not what can you tell me about the Milankovitch cycles Milankovitch

249
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:31,600
cycles are the orbital cycles of the earth the earth orbit around the sun and it's tilt of the axis

250
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,440
and the distance from the sun that that is not a perfect circular orbit around the sun it's kind

251
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,160
of an ellipse and it changes through time and all those factors work together to put a little bit

252
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:50,960
more solar energy in certain places and less than others and what we talk about in ice ages

253
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:58,800
which uh these cycles are likely related to is that if you can melt the snow in Canada

254
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,960
in the summer then you won't have an ice age so the snow falls in the winter you melt it in the

255
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:11,440
summer no ice age if you can't melt the snow in Canada in the summer for some reason the

256
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:19,440
earth is tilted away a bit in July and August and so on and the snow hangs around all summer long

257
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,360
the next winter more snow piles up the next summer it doesn't melt the next winter more snow

258
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:31,120
so you get this mechanism that adds snow and then you come up with an ice age and so the tilt

259
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:38,400
of the axis and other parameters I just mentioned can moderate how much sunlight comes in in the

260
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:45,600
summertime in Canada and it's up to 100 watts per meter squared which is a a lot of energy

261
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,560
difference over time and that's probably the biggest theory that has a pretty good amount of

262
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:58,720
evidence with it that those orbital changes can cause huge changes in the climate from ice age to

263
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:09,360
the current uh intercalation when I spoke to dr curry she said in the long term uh negligible

264
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,240
influence that humans have on the planet but what we seem to forget is that the climate's

265
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:23,040
going to do what the climate's going to do do you conquer uh yes you just mentioned the ice ages

266
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,000
but those are huge swings in the climate that the humans of course didn't have anything to do with so

267
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:38,160
maybe if if your listeners thought about it this way that the sun sends down on average about 160

268
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:45,360
watts per meter square 160 the atmosphere itself sends down about 340 so you know heat comes from

269
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,400
the atmosphere above us that's 500 watts per meter square when you add it together so you're

270
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,840
looking up about 500 watts are coming down on average for the globe the extra carbon dioxide

271
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,960
and so on is about two watts so you can see that this 500 watts that's natural and it can go up and

272
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,480
down and vary and so on the extra two is not going to have much effect that's why it's hard

273
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,960
we're trying to find what is the impact of that extra two watts per meter squared and it's pretty

274
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,760
tough it might be found in the in the oceans is a little bit more jewels of energy going into the

275
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,520
oceans than before but was that due to just a change in clouds that was natural or is it due

276
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,720
to the extra carbon dioxide now extra carbon dioxide does send down that two watts i'm not

277
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,760
saying it doesn't uh but the atmosphere and the ocean can respond and release a lot of that extra

278
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,400
two watts and evidently that's what's happening because the earth isn't warming up as much as the

279
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:55,200
models that suggest there's claims that the way that humans are living is causing daily extinction

280
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:06,640
of two to three hundred different species is this a natural course of evolution you know 99%

281
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:13,360
of the species that have ever lived are extinct so extinction is pretty natural obviously

282
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,240
have humans caused some extinctions well certainly you know when you destroy the environment of a

283
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,080
small place and that was the only place that particular species live then yes you know humans

284
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,800
caused that extinction did the climate change that humans caused cause any extinctions i think

285
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:38,480
that jury is still out uh because most uh species love the extra carbon dioxide plants do specifically

286
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,440
and then everything that eats plants loves that so you might want to say the extra carbon dioxide

287
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:51,760
actually helped in some sense the whole biosphere but i think that what humans do to the surface

288
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:59,680
and to the water if it's not clean properly and if you just really poison the surface in the air

289
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,960
then that can cause some real problems for the species that are living out there and that's why

290
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:14,000
we have rules about making not putting poison in the air or in the water does that qualify as climate

291
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:22,720
change no no uh to say carbon dioxide is a poison is you know you really have to scratch your head

292
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:31,360
on that because plants love the stuff it invigorates the biosphere um when did all of this greenery

293
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:39,040
evolve and the corals you know occur and grow and develop it occurred when there was two to four

294
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:46,880
times five times as much CO2 as that is in the air now so carbon dioxide invigorates the biosphere

295
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:53,280
so we're just actually putting back carbon dioxide that had been in the atmosphere earlier and uh i

296
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,720
don't think the world is going to have too much problem that in terms of its biosphere uh the

297
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:05,680
issue about is climate going to become so bad that some things can't handle it and i don't really see

298
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,200
the evidence for that happening critics of your views on climate have argued that you

299
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:18,800
undercut your credibility by making claims for that exceed your data and that you're unwilling to

300
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:31,680
agree with different findings how do you respond to that uh show me a finding and and let me look at

301
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:38,480
it and uh if it's a valid finding fine i'll agree with it uh but uh you know you can find anything on

302
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,720
the web these days about claims that uh someone might make but you show me the evidence let me see

303
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:51,760
what you're complaining about and uh we can have a discussion about that but i what my publication

304
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,760
show i just had one published last week on snowfall in the western states of the united states that

305
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,200
shows for the main snowfall regions there is no trend in snowfall the amount of snow that's falling

306
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,360
right now is the same as it was 120 years ago so snowfall is still falling out in the western

307
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:15,120
mountains of the united states that's evidence that this data and so when someone has a claim that

308
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:20,720
oh snowfall is going away out in the west i said well well here look at these the evidence from

309
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:27,840
real station data that people recorded back in 1890 to now and uh and so i can answer that question

310
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:33,680
with real information and and you don't see many of people like me in debates because they're not

311
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,880
offered uh in fact i've been uninvited you know someone on a particular panel would say hey let's

312
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,520
get this guy to come here and speak to us and then i receive the the de-invitation because it was

313
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:55,200
not going to go along with the theme of their climate change as a catastrophe uh presentation

314
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,560
on those occasions that you referred to in the past that co2 levels were significantly

315
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:15,760
higher than they are now do records show any negative effects as a result of such high co2

316
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,720
well when you say negative you're that's almost a moral question good or bad that the dinosaurs

317
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,400
went extinct well as the dinosaurs and i think they did have an opinion about that um

318
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:38,160
well let me rephrase if it had to be on those levels today would negatively impact

319
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,360
that will mentally impact humanity okay what we see is um

320
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,320
as carbon dioxide event has increased in other words humans are producing energy

321
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:00,400
so that their lives can be uh enhanced i mean there is a direct relationship between how much

322
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,880
carbon or energy you're able to use and carbon is the main source today and your thrive ability

323
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,800
it's basically one to one you know think about it we didn't leave the stone age because we ran out

324
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,920
of rocks you have the stone age because something better came along you know iron bronze and so on

325
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:30,560
and in terms of energy we didn't leave the wood and dung age because we ran out of trees or excrement

326
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:38,720
we found a better source than was carbon coal oil and so on and transportation you know we didn't

327
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:46,160
leave the horse and buggy age because we ran out of horses it's because Henry Ford made a vehicle

328
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,080
that was cheap and affordable my great grandfather who was a destitute poverty in oklahoma in the 1930s

329
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:59,840
had a Model T and so uh and another thing about Henry Ford he didn't go around getting the government

330
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,600
to kill all the horses so you'd only have to buy his car horses were still available for the poorest

331
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:11,280
people you know and the government didn't uh he didn't make the government go out and build gas

332
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,240
stations or drill for oil you know that was done at the market for the private level but today we

333
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,600
have a government that says this is what i want for the energy structure and so we're going to be uh

334
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,800
uh using your taxpayer money and we're going to put out all these charging stations and force you

335
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,280
to buy electric cars or at least subsidize them tremendously and put up all these windmills and

336
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:39,120
so on uh at great expense and great environmental wreckage and i can assure you that without energy

337
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:45,920
life is brutal and short and so energy is the thing that has caused uh our life spans to double

338
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:54,480
and so children no longer fear about or we don't have to fear for uh diseases that used to wipe out

339
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:01,280
millions because of the advances that energy has brought out through electricity and experimentation

340
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,000
and all the sciences that we have developed now that's based upon that access to energy

341
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:15,360
and so yes uh developing countries and and here's my i mean i'm not making this as a prediction

342
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:22,000
i'm just using this as an observation they're going to get their energy they are going to find

343
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,600
the energy and right now it's carbon that's the cheapest and most effective and very high density

344
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:34,000
and so we will see these countries use carbon to advance and we should not stand in their way

345
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,480
because they want to live like us who already have pretty big carbon footprints uh but if you

346
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,960
want to have some comfort in that is uh the carbon dioxide we're putting back into the atmosphere

347
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:54,560
is invigorating the biosphere and it also represents people living longer and better

348
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:01,120
lives there's just no question that is energy is made available and affordable people live longer

349
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:09,120
and better lives and uh i think that's going to ultimately be the the inertia that's going to carry

350
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:16,960
forward this uh issue kind of past all the preaching about carbon dioxide problems

351
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:24,480
environmentalists would argue that they're not against electricity and prosperity

352
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,760
they're just advocating for a better cleaner way to do it it's a tremendous misconception

353
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,720
that a windmill or a solar panel can somehow give you cleaner and reliable energy than what you have

354
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,720
now that's just not true to build a windmill the environmental wreckage that you have to go through

355
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,240
is tremendous in terms of all the minerals you have to yank out of the earth and process

356
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,400
process takes energy by the way and building all these transmission lines i mean the energy is so

357
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,360
diffuse it is so weak in wind and solar that you have to gather up huge amounts of land to

358
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:08,960
put it together i think uh robert brice said it well i think he called it the iron law of power

359
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,440
something like that that the weaker the source of energy the more stuff and material you need

360
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:22,000
to gather it to concentrate it to make it useful and so you find out you have to spend huge amounts

361
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,640
of dollars in environmental cost to make a windmill or make a solar panel which by the way

362
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:36,400
doesn't last forever and uh and so this carbon that already has a tremendous amount of energy

363
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,480
in a very small dense space means that the environmental footprint is much much smaller

364
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,600
than what you have with a solar or wind in fact i like you know it's about one to a thousand or

365
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:56,000
two thousand in terms of the square footage you need and i like to tell people you know i i ran

366
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,560
five miles this morning so and there was a little bit of wind it was cloudy so if you had a solar

367
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:07,600
panel it would have helped you anyway but think about sun and wind you can go out and enjoy them

368
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,240
the breeze which tells you they don't have much energy if they don't you know bring you great

369
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:21,520
harm this wind is so energy poor that you can stand out in the wind not be bothered you can stand out

370
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:27,040
in the sun and not be bothered but go try to stand in the boiler of a natural gas fire power plant

371
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,640
you'd be burnt to a crisp that's the kind of energy you need to push electrons and that's the

372
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:39,600
amount of energy that can be done or that process can be done in a very small environmental footprint

373
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:46,720
that then allows the rest of the environment to to not be interfered with by this energy production

374
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:53,440
but look at windmill and solar panel farms not only are they just ugly but they do cause

375
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,320
tremendous environmental damage in their construction and maintenance

376
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,280
what are the long-term effects i'm talking decades from now

377
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,800
if we just continue to get our energy from fossil fuels how bad can it get

378
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:20,400
well let me start how good can you talk about people that will have access to affordable energy

379
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,480
so they're going to live longer and they're going to live better lives you have access to this

380
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:31,360
the impact on the climate i think is what is about the only thing you think of is uh well the sea

381
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,600
level is going to continue to rise has been rising for several hundred years so it's it's going to

382
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:43,520
continue to rise and at a manageable rate by the way um and the atmosphere it might warm

383
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:52,400
some more uh but certainly not in terms of that catastrophic effect that will cause us to

384
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:02,800
lose our ability to thrive i'm just very i'm pretty optimistic you know people are clever

385
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,320
and they can figure out how to adapt to whatever is going to happen

386
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,520
the real issues i deal with as a state climatologists are the extreme events

387
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:18,080
that we know are going to happen that you're not ready for i mean that flood that happened

388
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:23,440
you know 50 years ago is going to come back again and it's going to cause some real problems

389
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,640
if you don't build your infrastructure and put your houses where they can be safe

390
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,680
or industry uh if you don't build up on the coast too much so that you won't be clobbered

391
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:39,200
by a hurricane or something like that so it's these kind of natural extreme events that we're

392
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,880
far more vulnerable to right now than some small and gradual change that the climate system might

393
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:52,960
undergo i did read somewhere that someone has asked you and i'm sure you must get it a lot

394
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,800
whether you get any funding from the fossil fuel industry do you

395
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:06,000
no i do not and i made that decision way back in the 19 early 1990s so that uh you know someone

396
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,840
can come to me and and a fossil fuel i might make a fossil fuel company mad by some of

397
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:19,440
information i've produced but so be it if i can then put my head to bed at night and not be worried

398
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:26,400
about did i uh accommodate some agenda somewhere i'm just after what the observations say can i

399
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,920
build the best observational data set to answer the questions of climate that we have and uh and

400
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,680
that's that's what i want to do i suppose one of the biggest tragedies about it would be that it

401
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:43,840
would discredit the real science and the the fundamental research that you're doing just

402
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:49,040
that it'll be a non-starter because people will immediately just yeah and that's unfortunate

403
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:55,040
because the perception then is that well if a fossil fuel company paid someone to do some

404
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,840
research they really wanted to know the answer about something and this person was completely

405
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:06,560
honest did the work properly and provided the answer to the fossil fuel companies is as you said

406
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:13,520
is well that answer would be tainted because it came from a fossil fuel company well hello think

407
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:20,000
about what environmental advocacy groups and pressure groups do all of the time they pay

408
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:29,120
tremendous sums to people so they can come up with an answer that gives them their leverage in

409
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:36,000
claiming this is a catastrophic problem but so i can take that at least perception off the table

410
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:42,720
lastly are you aware of any ways in which geoengineering could possibly be affecting

411
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:50,000
the natural balance of things is it being done more than we're aware of

412
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,640
and could it backfire anytime humans do something they're going to have an impact

413
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,760
there's just no question about that so you could call that geoengineering but inadvertent

414
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:10,160
we have made some desert valleys cooler because now we irrigate crops so we've

415
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:17,440
you know taken water that fell someplace and moved it to another place and so that's a bit

416
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:24,400
of geoengineering there and that by the way a lot of those places feed a lot of the world so

417
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:31,600
you can't say it's bad i suppose but the other question about geoengineering is can we do something

418
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:38,000
to prevent a perceived problem here and that's the real danger i think because you don't know the

419
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,920
consequences of when you start tinkering with a very complex and dynamical system and so i would

420
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:53,040
say stay away from that suppose someone did a big geo geoengineering experiment and it was and

421
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,960
something bad happened somewhere well that country would sue the world and say look you made this

422
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,000
bad thing happen to us you are liable and so then we're getting nowhere in terms of

423
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:10,800
preventing some problem on the planet
