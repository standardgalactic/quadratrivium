0	6560	I'm Najja Swat for business.com and joining me today is Dr. John Christie, climate scientist at
6560	13200	the University of Alabama in Huntsville and Alabama state climatologist since 2000. Dr. Christie,
13200	20720	thank you so much for your time. My pleasure. You've described yourself as a climate nerd
20720	27520	and apparently you were 12 when your unwaving desire to understand whether and climate started.
28400	36080	Why climate? Well, I was, I think it was more like 10 years old when I was fascinated with
37040	43520	some unusual weather events that happened in my home area of California and so that began a
43520	50000	fascination for me and I wanted to try to figure out why things happened the way they did. Why
50000	55520	did one year have more rain? That's a big story in California. Does it rain or not? And another year
55520	61920	would be very dry. Why were the mountains covered with snow in one April and not another? In fact,
61920	73120	I have here April 1967 that I recorded as a teenager. So this has been a passion of mine forever and
73840	80560	as it turns out now that I'm as old as I am, I still can't figure out why one year is wetter
80560	88240	than the other. Well, you seem to be getting a lot closer than most people. I think it was in 1989
88240	97520	when you and NASA scientist Roy Spencer pioneered a new method of measuring monitoring temperature
97520	106320	records via satellites. Since that time up until now, why did you feel you needed to develop a
106320	113760	new method to begin with and how did it differ in terms of the readings of established methods at
113760	122400	the time? Well, the issue was we only had surface temperature measurements and they are scattered
122400	126720	over the world. They don't cover much of the world at all actually, mainly just the land regions
126720	133360	and scattered places on the ocean. The measurement itself is not that robust. The stations move,
133360	137120	the instruments change through time and so it's a very difficult thing to make. In fact,
137920	145280	a small little change in the area right around the station can really affect the temperature
145280	150880	of that station. So Roy Spencer and Dick McKnighter came up with an idea about looking at some
150880	157520	satellite data and this is the temperature of the deep layer of the atmosphere. So this is like the
157520	165200	surface to 8,000 meters, you know, something like that and so if we could see the temperature of that
165200	172320	bulk atmospheric layer, we would have a very robust measurement and the microwave sensors on the
172320	178560	NOAA polo orbiting satellites did precisely that and so we were the first to really put those data
178560	189280	into a simple data set that had the temperature then for month by month since about November 1978.
191040	196480	Okay and how did your readings differ from the climate science at the time?
198400	203760	Well, first of all, they differ because we had a global measurement. We really did see the entire
203760	208960	globe from satellite because the orbit of that satellite is polar and the earth spins around
208960	213680	underneath so every day we have 14 orbits that the earth spins around underneath and we see the
213680	219760	entire planet so that's one big difference and the other one is that the actual result did not
219760	225680	show as much warming as what the surface temperatures showed and we're doing even more work now to
225680	233760	demonstrate that a lot of the surface stations are spuriously affected by the growth of an
233760	237760	infrastructure around them and so there's kind of a false warming signal there.
237760	241920	You don't get the background climate signal with surface temperature measurements, you get
242560	244960	a bit of what's happening in the local area.
245680	257360	Well, your research has to do with testing the theories posited by climate model forecasts
257360	265840	so you don't actually do any modeling yourself but what criteria do you use to test these theories?
266720	273520	That's a very good question because in climate you hear all kinds of claims and theories being
273520	279680	thrown out there and for a lot of people who don't really understand the climate system it's a
279680	285120	quick and easy answer just to say oh humans caused that you know global warming or something like
285120	290080	that is the answer when the climate system is very complex so we look at these claims
290080	296960	and Roy Spencer and I when I say we are just a few of the people around the world that actually
296960	303680	build data sets from scratch. I mean we start with the photon counts of the satellite radiometers
303680	312000	or the you know the original paper records of 19th century East Africa. We do all this from scratch
312560	318080	and so that we can test the claims that people make and what we find is that once we build the
318080	324160	data set we make sure we have confidence in the data set that it's telling us a truth about what's
324160	332080	happening over time we can determine that as well or test it then we check the claim. So for
332080	336880	example on surface temperature data sets that we make that go back to the 19th century someone will
336880	343440	say well this is the hottest decade or more records happened this decade than in the past and we can
343440	348160	demonstrate in the United States especially that that's not the case that you would need to go back
348160	355280	to the 1930s if you want to see real record temperatures that occurred at that time and for
355280	363840	climate models we like to use the satellite data set it's a robust deep layer measurement so it's
363840	370880	measuring lots of mass of the atmosphere the heat content really and so that's a direct value we can
370880	376320	get out of the climate models so we are comparing what we say apples to apples what the satellite
376320	382560	produces and observes is what the climate model also generates and we can compare them one to one
383120	389440	and in the paper Ross McKintock and I wrote a couple of years ago we found that 100% of the
389440	395840	climate models were warming the atmosphere faster than it was actually warming so that's not a good
395840	401600	result if you're trying to test your theory of how the climate works with a model against what
401600	410160	actually happens with the models how much do you think of the deeply over exaggerated
411280	416080	predictions that doom and gloom have to do with the fact that the methodology is
416800	423120	it's substantiated by confirmation bias well you know that that's an interesting question because
423120	430240	we're a bit confused as well is we have been publishing these papers since 1994 that have
430240	437600	demonstrated models warm too much relative to the actual climate and yet we don't see an improvement
437600	445120	in climate models and trying to match reality with their model output now I think a number of
445120	453200	modelers understand that yes there is a difference there and it's the models are just too hot but
453200	458480	what is the process that's gone wrong in the models to make that is a difficult question for
458480	466400	these folks because models have hundreds of places you could turn a little knob change a coefficient
466400	471200	and that will change the result now it's not a physical thing it's not based on physics it's
471200	478160	it's the model parameterizations we call them the little pieces of the model that try to represent
479200	485760	an actual part of the atmosphere like when do clouds form that's a pretty big question is
486400	492960	how much humidity in the atmosphere is required to create a cloud because once the cloud forms
492960	497360	that reflects sunlight and cools the earth so that's it that's one of the big questions there is
498800	506560	so in testing the models we like to use the bulk atmospheric temperature that's a very direct
506560	514000	measurement that models produce in the atmosphere produce and so we can then say there's a problem
514000	523760	here with climate models to what degree the dual observations data differ from their forecasts
525280	531600	well generally it's about a factor of two at times it's been more but the latest models on
531600	537200	average the models for the deep layer of the atmosphere are warming about twice too fast
537920	544800	and that's a real problem I think when now we're looking at over 40 years what we can test these
544800	552880	models with and they're already that far off and so I will we should not use them to to tell us
552880	556320	what's going to happen in the future since they haven't even gotten us to the right place in the
556320	566880	last four years but given that your real world data it's refuted what the forecasts were every
566880	578240	time for decades why then and I recognize that this is conjecture we can't really be sure but on
579360	587440	let's say 97 99 percent of scientists so firmly behind the climate crisis narrative
589760	594400	yeah I don't know how many are really fully behind that crisis climate narrative I
595120	602880	saw a recent survey where about 55 percent might have been of the opinion that the climate warming
602880	609840	was going to be a problem warming itself is not a problem I mean the earth has been warmer in the
609840	618320	past than it is today so the earth has survived that before and I don't think putting extra
618720	626560	you know plant food in the atmosphere is going to be a real problem for us to overcome I do think
626560	630640	the world is going to warm some from the extra CO2 but there are a lot of benefits that come from
630640	641200	that by the way you're dealing with a question about human nature and funding and so on and I
641200	646480	think we all know that the more dramatic a story is especially in the political world
647440	654000	the more attention you will get and therefore your work can be highlighted and that helps you
654000	661840	with funding and attention and so on and that's kind of part of what's going on here then there's
661840	672640	the other real stronger political narrative that folks there are groups and in the world
673280	679600	political elite that like to have a narrative that scares people so that they can then offer a
679600	686800	solution and so simple way to say elect me to this office and I will be able to solve this problem
686800	694480	that you are facing people like us who actually produce the data and look at you know extreme
694480	699040	events and so on say well you know there isn't any change in these extreme events so what's the
699040	704560	problem you're trying to solve and then we look at the other side of that issue and say okay if you
704560	710800	actually implement this regulation or this law it's not going to have any make any difference on
710800	717120	the climate anyway so it's a you kind of lose on two ends on that story. You're a distinguished
717120	723120	professor of atmospheric science and also director of earth sciences also at Alabama in Huntsville
723840	730720	these are prominent positions how have you managed to hold on to them with climate views
730720	740000	that are so divergent from the norm? Well the environment in the state of Alabama is different
740000	746960	than what you have in Washington and as I like to tell people that one of the reasons I like to
746960	752400	live in Alabama and I'm from California way across the country is that in Alabama you can
752400	760560	call a duck a duck that you can just be flat on about what's going on and you're not going to be
760560	769120	given the evil eye or cast out as it is now in the climate establishment you know saying that all
769120	776080	the models are warming too much and that there is not a disaster arising that causes great consternation
776080	781280	because of the narrative that has been built over the last 30 years that we are supposed to be in a
781280	787120	catastrophe and to come out and say well here's the data and the data show there is no catastrophe
787120	794160	looming we're doing fine the world is doing fine human life is thriving in places it's allowed to
794160	800480	so what's the problem here you're trying to solve? Did you ever manage to get your findings to
802160	809360	policy makers that have interest to do something about it? Well you know I've been
809920	817040	to Congress 20 times testified before hearings so the information is there and available
818080	827200	but I can't force Congress to make legislation that matches the real world the congressional world
827200	834080	is a political world and things happen there that are kind of out of my reach and ability to influence
834160	841200	I suppose. According to your research you've also said that the climate models underestimate
841200	848480	negative feedback loops so can you explain to me what this mechanism is and the effect of
849680	855840	overestimation of the loops on understanding climate for what it is? All right now that's a
855840	861680	very complicated issue and I don't understand it all for sure but we can say just from some
861680	867920	general results in general observation what's going on here and one of those general observation is
867920	877680	that when a climate model warms up the atmosphere one Kelvin one degree that it sends out 1.4 watts
877680	887040	per meter squared so the air atmosphere warms up and energy escapes to space 1.4 when we use
887040	893520	actual observations of the atmosphere when the real atmosphere warms up one Kelvin it sends out
893520	900800	2.6 watts of energy almost twice as much so that tells you right there that the climate models are
900800	908800	retaining or holding on to energy that the real world allows to escape when it warms so that's
908800	914720	kind of a negative feedback that as the atmosphere warms for a bit the real world knows how to let
914720	920720	that heat escape whereas the models don't and they retain it and that's why they keep building up heat
920720	928880	over time. What other variables do you look at? Yeah the state climatologists I deal a lot with
929520	934240	very practical questions that people ask they want them is it getting hotter is it getting
934240	940240	wetter are the rainstorms getting heavier and so are the hurricanes getting worse and so I actually
940800	947280	wrote a booklet called I practical guide to climate change in Alabama but it covers a lot of the
947280	952320	country as well so it's not just this it's free you can download it from my website
954320	959360	the Alabama state climatologist is on the first page and I answer a lot of these very practical
959360	969040	questions and one as we go down the list there aren't any more droughts droughts are not getting
969120	976480	worse over time heavy rainstorms are not getting worse over time here in the southeast in fact
976480	981840	Ross McKittrick and I also had a paper on that where we went back to 1878 and demonstrated that
981840	988640	the trends are not significant hurricanes no they're not going up at all in fact 2022 is going to be
988640	995840	one of the quietest that we've had in a while tornadoes are not becoming more numerous heat
995840	1002640	waves are not becoming worse so one after another though the weather that people really care about
1002640	1010160	that if it changes could cause problem or catastrophe we find those events are not changing
1010160	1022560	they've always been around some of the biggest critics of climate skeptics say okay yes no fair
1023280	1032080	one extreme weather event doesn't say much but they argue that they are very particular trends
1032080	1040160	that have been on the increase like recently have you observed this at all that's exactly
1040160	1047600	the kind of thing we build data sets to discover for example there is a story and there is some
1047600	1053840	evidence for it that in the last hundred years there's been an increase in in heavy rain events
1053840	1060160	in part of our country not all of it just part of the country so I built a data set that went back
1060160	1066560	to the 1870s in fact it back to the 1860s and so on and we looked at that very carefully and found
1066560	1074240	that well when you go back far enough there were a lot of heavy events back then and so over the
1074240	1083920	long time period of 140 years or more we don't see an upward trend that's unusual in that sample of
1083920	1092480	time 140 years that we don't see a change in those kind of events so that's why you know one of the
1092480	1099440	real things I think has great value to it is to build these data sets so you can specifically
1099440	1106240	answer the question and the claim that is being made I think one of the worst ones was made by
1106240	1112240	the New York Times when they were talking about how many record high temperatures occurred in a
1112240	1118800	recent heatwave around the country and so I looked at that a little bit more carefully and they were
1118800	1126800	allowing stations to be included that only had 30 years or less of data even less than 30 years
1126880	1132960	so some had 100 years but a lot of them just had 30 years well when you become very systematic and
1132960	1138800	say okay I'm only going to allow stations that have 100 years so that every station that measured
1138800	1144960	in 2022 can be compared with the entire time series and then their story falls apart because
1144960	1149760	the 30s and the 50s were so hot in our country that they still hold the records for the number
1149760	1158160	of high temperature events just the scary thing for me is that as much as it completely falls
1158160	1165920	apart there's no logic to it it still firmly stands as what most people believe you have to
1165920	1172240	give credit to those who in the climate establishment and the media or whoever is behind all this that
1172240	1178800	they have been successful in scaring people about the climate because now you find that even in
1178800	1187200	grade school textbooks and almost every new story that comes out will try to throw in and this is
1187200	1193600	where this establishment is very good is they make sure every story has some kind of line in it about
1193600	1199840	climate change and they don't ever go back and talk to someone who actually builds these data
1199840	1205840	set sentences is that really the worst it's been in the last 120 years they just make those claims
1205840	1214160	and so other than the fact the sea level is rising a bit the extreme events are just not
1215040	1224800	there to really cause problems now we are in a problem of having greater damages occur because
1224800	1230880	of extreme events and that's mainly because we've just built so much more stuff and placed it in harm's
1230880	1240320	way our coastlines are crowded with condominiums and uh entertainment parks and uh retirement
1240320	1244960	villages and so on there's so many more of them that when a hurricane does come well it's going
1244960	1250640	to wipe out a lot more and so we've served sure the damages the the absolute value of those damages
1250640	1256960	has gone up but the number of hurricanes their strength and so on the background climate has
1257040	1262160	not caused that problem it's just that we like to build things in places that are dangerous
1262720	1267520	we have you know records of sea level rise and it's on the order of about an inch per decade
1267520	1274320	except in places where the land is sinking pretty rapidly and you can find that on the Louisiana
1274320	1281280	Gulf Coast and in places like that but otherwise it's about an inch per decade and I tell folks
1282240	1288640	that an inch per decade you know if they want to have centimeters a decade is not your problem
1289600	1298880	it's 10 feet in six hours from the next hurricane that's your problem if you can withstand a rise of
1298880	1304480	sea level of 10 feet in six hours then you're probably going to be okay but if you can't then
1304480	1308160	a hurricane can really cause problems and so we just have more exposure to that kind of
1308240	1314320	this situation now than we've had before what about the trend with sea level rise
1316640	1321840	should we be worried about future generations having to deal with issues that might not affect us
1321840	1328400	in our lifetime but eventually we'll threaten their lives I think your listeners would you know
1328400	1335680	need to understand that sea level is a dynamic variable it goes up it goes down it has been
1335680	1342640	over a hundred meters lower than today just in the last 25,000 years and there was a period
1342640	1347920	from about 15,000 years ago to 8,000 years ago where the sea level rose
1350320	1361200	you know about 12 centimeters per decade for you know 7,000 years now that's a lot more than
1361200	1367360	two and a half centimeters per decade as it's doing now so the world has managed to deal with
1367360	1374800	sea level before and if we go back to the last warm period about 130,000 years ago the sea level
1374800	1381360	then was higher than it is now by about five meters or so and so just naturally we would expect at
1381360	1386400	least another five meters of sea level it won't happen tomorrow it won't happen this century but
1386480	1394080	slowly it will likely continue to rise and so that should be placed in your thinking if you're
1394080	1400400	building a dock for say a military port or something if you want it to last a long time just put a
1400400	1407520	cushion in there a way to manage to handle another half meter of sea level rise in the next hundred
1407520	1413360	years and you should be okay your temperature records
1415920	1418960	but how much has the earth warmed
1421120	1427200	let's say over the last 40 years yes we have about I think with this November
1427760	1436080	we finished 43 years 43 years of measurements and in that time the temperature has risen
1436080	1443680	half degree Celsius and you might want to look at other things about the world the world has
1444240	1451200	expanded agricultural production tremendously nations are now exporting grain where they had
1451200	1455440	before because people are pretty smart they figure out how to do things better all the time
1455440	1461120	and growing food is one thing they figured out how to do better as time has gone on so the climate
1461120	1469600	has not been a this warming of a half degree has not been anything that caused a major catastrophe
1469600	1477840	at all wealth has increased around the planet now some governments are trying to prevent you from
1478800	1485600	growing your wealth but it that's a hard thing to stop people like to have food they like to have
1485600	1490720	conveniences in their life and that's hard to you know pass laws that say you can't enjoy the
1490720	1501600	life of what you want to how much of that warming are you reliably able to say is as a result of
1501600	1511680	human activity okay the answer is none in the sense you said reliably and I can't come up with an
1511680	1520160	answer for reliably the work we have done that just assumes all of the warming is that warming that
1520160	1526080	is not due to El Nino or warming that's not due to volcanic suppression of temperatures earlier in
1526080	1534320	the record comes up to about a tenth of a degree per decade if it's not due to human activity
1534320	1541360	reliably let's say are there other factors that we can say for sure let's say geothermal cooling
1541920	1549920	heating those kinds of things that we can say for a fact have played a role in the incremental
1550560	1556400	warming of the planet over the last few decades yeah what we see is that we've had a couple of
1556400	1563040	volcanoes in the first half of that period algae chone and penitubo and those cool the planet in the
1563040	1570720	first half of that 40 years and so that tilted the trend up so if you add the warming early back
1570720	1575120	in then that trip tends to tilt the trend a little back down and that's where I come up with a one
1575120	1581680	tenth per decade is the warming rate which means the climate is not very sensitive to carbon dioxide
1581680	1588720	or greenhouse gas warming as the popular ideas about it are it's probably half or even less
1589280	1596640	but about half as sensitive as models tend to report so if CO2
1598960	1603600	exposure or insertion into the atmosphere were to double what would the results be
1604480	1609760	okay well I actually had a little paper on that and we're kind of expecting maybe about
1609840	1618320	2070 2080 it will be doubled from what it was back in 1850 and the warming of that amount
1619280	1627280	will be about a degree 1.3 I think is what I calculated but that was from that earlier period
1627280	1635760	so you would say that much of the warming was due to humans about 1.3 degrees C and the general rule
1635760	1642000	I found with people is they don't mind an extra degree on their temperature in fact if you look at
1642000	1648400	the United States the average American experiences a much warmer temperature now than they did 100
1648400	1654880	years ago and that's because the average American has moved south the average American has moved to
1654880	1661760	much warmer climates California Arizona Texas you know Alabama Florida and so on because cold is
1661760	1666960	not a whole lot of fun you know seeing and snowmobiling and ice fishing and so on that's fine
1666960	1673280	but the average person likes it to be warm and so that's why the many people in our millions in
1673280	1681200	our country have moved to warmer areas and so I don't think that one 1.3 Kelvin whatever I said
1681920	1686720	it's going to matter much in terms of the weather people really care about those extreme events and
1686720	1697920	so on what do your temperature records tell you about previous hotter temperatures since what was
1697920	1706080	it 1978 what we see you know there is an upward trend in the in the global temperature that I think
1706080	1718080	is manageable but it goes up and down the 1998 El Nino was a big event 2016 El Nino was a big event
1718080	1723040	so we see these ups but we also see the downs that come from a volcano that might go off and
1723040	1730640	cools the planet those are bigger effects than that small trend that's going up the global
1730640	1737120	temperature can change by two tenths of a degree from month to month and so when we're talking about
1737120	1743600	a tenth per decade then we're talking about you know a month a month we can handle and we can't
1743600	1749680	handle 20 years worth of a small change just doesn't make sense and and the evidence of the real
1749680	1755600	world is pretty clear that humans have done extremely well as the planet has been warming a little
1755600	1764320	bit whether it's natural or not what can you tell me about the Milankovitch cycles Milankovitch
1764320	1771600	cycles are the orbital cycles of the earth the earth orbit around the sun and it's tilt of the axis
1771600	1777440	and the distance from the sun that that is not a perfect circular orbit around the sun it's kind
1777440	1784160	of an ellipse and it changes through time and all those factors work together to put a little bit
1784160	1790960	more solar energy in certain places and less than others and what we talk about in ice ages
1791680	1798800	which uh these cycles are likely related to is that if you can melt the snow in Canada
1799360	1804960	in the summer then you won't have an ice age so the snow falls in the winter you melt it in the
1804960	1811440	summer no ice age if you can't melt the snow in Canada in the summer for some reason the
1811440	1819440	earth is tilted away a bit in July and August and so on and the snow hangs around all summer long
1819440	1825360	the next winter more snow piles up the next summer it doesn't melt the next winter more snow
1825360	1831120	so you get this mechanism that adds snow and then you come up with an ice age and so the tilt
1831120	1838400	of the axis and other parameters I just mentioned can moderate how much sunlight comes in in the
1838400	1845600	summertime in Canada and it's up to 100 watts per meter squared which is a a lot of energy
1846720	1852560	difference over time and that's probably the biggest theory that has a pretty good amount of
1852560	1858720	evidence with it that those orbital changes can cause huge changes in the climate from ice age to
1858720	1869360	the current uh intercalation when I spoke to dr curry she said in the long term uh negligible
1870320	1876240	influence that humans have on the planet but what we seem to forget is that the climate's
1876240	1883040	going to do what the climate's going to do do you conquer uh yes you just mentioned the ice ages
1883040	1888000	but those are huge swings in the climate that the humans of course didn't have anything to do with so
1889200	1898160	maybe if if your listeners thought about it this way that the sun sends down on average about 160
1898160	1905360	watts per meter square 160 the atmosphere itself sends down about 340 so you know heat comes from
1905360	1910400	the atmosphere above us that's 500 watts per meter square when you add it together so you're
1910400	1915840	looking up about 500 watts are coming down on average for the globe the extra carbon dioxide
1915840	1922960	and so on is about two watts so you can see that this 500 watts that's natural and it can go up and
1922960	1928480	down and vary and so on the extra two is not going to have much effect that's why it's hard
1928480	1934960	we're trying to find what is the impact of that extra two watts per meter squared and it's pretty
1934960	1941760	tough it might be found in the in the oceans is a little bit more jewels of energy going into the
1941760	1947520	oceans than before but was that due to just a change in clouds that was natural or is it due
1947520	1952720	to the extra carbon dioxide now extra carbon dioxide does send down that two watts i'm not
1952720	1959760	saying it doesn't uh but the atmosphere and the ocean can respond and release a lot of that extra
1959760	1964400	two watts and evidently that's what's happening because the earth isn't warming up as much as the
1964400	1975200	models that suggest there's claims that the way that humans are living is causing daily extinction
1975200	1986640	of two to three hundred different species is this a natural course of evolution you know 99%
1986640	1993360	of the species that have ever lived are extinct so extinction is pretty natural obviously
1993360	1998240	have humans caused some extinctions well certainly you know when you destroy the environment of a
1998240	2004080	small place and that was the only place that particular species live then yes you know humans
2004080	2010800	caused that extinction did the climate change that humans caused cause any extinctions i think
2010800	2018480	that jury is still out uh because most uh species love the extra carbon dioxide plants do specifically
2018480	2023440	and then everything that eats plants loves that so you might want to say the extra carbon dioxide
2023440	2031760	actually helped in some sense the whole biosphere but i think that what humans do to the surface
2031760	2039680	and to the water if it's not clean properly and if you just really poison the surface in the air
2039680	2044960	then that can cause some real problems for the species that are living out there and that's why
2044960	2054000	we have rules about making not putting poison in the air or in the water does that qualify as climate
2054000	2062720	change no no uh to say carbon dioxide is a poison is you know you really have to scratch your head
2062720	2071360	on that because plants love the stuff it invigorates the biosphere um when did all of this greenery
2071360	2079040	evolve and the corals you know occur and grow and develop it occurred when there was two to four
2079040	2086880	times five times as much CO2 as that is in the air now so carbon dioxide invigorates the biosphere
2087600	2093280	so we're just actually putting back carbon dioxide that had been in the atmosphere earlier and uh i
2093280	2098720	don't think the world is going to have too much problem that in terms of its biosphere uh the
2098720	2105680	issue about is climate going to become so bad that some things can't handle it and i don't really see
2105680	2111200	the evidence for that happening critics of your views on climate have argued that you
2111200	2118800	undercut your credibility by making claims for that exceed your data and that you're unwilling to
2119120	2131680	agree with different findings how do you respond to that uh show me a finding and and let me look at
2131680	2138480	it and uh if it's a valid finding fine i'll agree with it uh but uh you know you can find anything on
2138480	2144720	the web these days about claims that uh someone might make but you show me the evidence let me see
2144720	2151760	what you're complaining about and uh we can have a discussion about that but i what my publication
2151760	2157760	show i just had one published last week on snowfall in the western states of the united states that
2157760	2163200	shows for the main snowfall regions there is no trend in snowfall the amount of snow that's falling
2163200	2169360	right now is the same as it was 120 years ago so snowfall is still falling out in the western
2169360	2175120	mountains of the united states that's evidence that this data and so when someone has a claim that
2175120	2180720	oh snowfall is going away out in the west i said well well here look at these the evidence from
2180720	2187840	real station data that people recorded back in 1890 to now and uh and so i can answer that question
2187840	2193680	with real information and and you don't see many of people like me in debates because they're not
2193680	2200880	offered uh in fact i've been uninvited you know someone on a particular panel would say hey let's
2200880	2207520	get this guy to come here and speak to us and then i receive the the de-invitation because it was
2207520	2215200	not going to go along with the theme of their climate change as a catastrophe uh presentation
2218000	2222560	on those occasions that you referred to in the past that co2 levels were significantly
2222560	2235760	higher than they are now do records show any negative effects as a result of such high co2
2237040	2242720	well when you say negative you're that's almost a moral question good or bad that the dinosaurs
2242720	2248400	went extinct well as the dinosaurs and i think they did have an opinion about that um
2248720	2258160	well let me rephrase if it had to be on those levels today would negatively impact
2259280	2265360	that will mentally impact humanity okay what we see is um
2267600	2272320	as carbon dioxide event has increased in other words humans are producing energy
2273280	2280400	so that their lives can be uh enhanced i mean there is a direct relationship between how much
2280400	2286880	carbon or energy you're able to use and carbon is the main source today and your thrive ability
2287920	2294800	it's basically one to one you know think about it we didn't leave the stone age because we ran out
2294800	2301920	of rocks you have the stone age because something better came along you know iron bronze and so on
2303040	2310560	and in terms of energy we didn't leave the wood and dung age because we ran out of trees or excrement
2311520	2318720	we found a better source than was carbon coal oil and so on and transportation you know we didn't
2318720	2326160	leave the horse and buggy age because we ran out of horses it's because Henry Ford made a vehicle
2326160	2332080	that was cheap and affordable my great grandfather who was a destitute poverty in oklahoma in the 1930s
2332640	2339840	had a Model T and so uh and another thing about Henry Ford he didn't go around getting the government
2339840	2345600	to kill all the horses so you'd only have to buy his car horses were still available for the poorest
2345600	2351280	people you know and the government didn't uh he didn't make the government go out and build gas
2351280	2356240	stations or drill for oil you know that was done at the market for the private level but today we
2356240	2361600	have a government that says this is what i want for the energy structure and so we're going to be uh
2361600	2366800	uh using your taxpayer money and we're going to put out all these charging stations and force you
2366800	2371280	to buy electric cars or at least subsidize them tremendously and put up all these windmills and
2371280	2379120	so on uh at great expense and great environmental wreckage and i can assure you that without energy
2379120	2385920	life is brutal and short and so energy is the thing that has caused uh our life spans to double
2386560	2394480	and so children no longer fear about or we don't have to fear for uh diseases that used to wipe out
2395120	2401280	millions because of the advances that energy has brought out through electricity and experimentation
2401280	2406000	and all the sciences that we have developed now that's based upon that access to energy
2407760	2415360	and so yes uh developing countries and and here's my i mean i'm not making this as a prediction
2415360	2422000	i'm just using this as an observation they're going to get their energy they are going to find
2422000	2427600	the energy and right now it's carbon that's the cheapest and most effective and very high density
2427600	2434000	and so we will see these countries use carbon to advance and we should not stand in their way
2434000	2440480	because they want to live like us who already have pretty big carbon footprints uh but if you
2440480	2446960	want to have some comfort in that is uh the carbon dioxide we're putting back into the atmosphere
2446960	2454560	is invigorating the biosphere and it also represents people living longer and better
2454560	2461120	lives there's just no question that is energy is made available and affordable people live longer
2461120	2469120	and better lives and uh i think that's going to ultimately be the the inertia that's going to carry
2469120	2476960	forward this uh issue kind of past all the preaching about carbon dioxide problems
2477840	2484480	environmentalists would argue that they're not against electricity and prosperity
2484480	2489760	they're just advocating for a better cleaner way to do it it's a tremendous misconception
2490400	2496720	that a windmill or a solar panel can somehow give you cleaner and reliable energy than what you have
2496720	2502720	now that's just not true to build a windmill the environmental wreckage that you have to go through
2502720	2508240	is tremendous in terms of all the minerals you have to yank out of the earth and process
2508880	2514400	process takes energy by the way and building all these transmission lines i mean the energy is so
2514400	2521360	diffuse it is so weak in wind and solar that you have to gather up huge amounts of land to
2521920	2528960	put it together i think uh robert brice said it well i think he called it the iron law of power
2528960	2535440	something like that that the weaker the source of energy the more stuff and material you need
2535440	2542000	to gather it to concentrate it to make it useful and so you find out you have to spend huge amounts
2542000	2548640	of dollars in environmental cost to make a windmill or make a solar panel which by the way
2548640	2556400	doesn't last forever and uh and so this carbon that already has a tremendous amount of energy
2556400	2562480	in a very small dense space means that the environmental footprint is much much smaller
2562480	2569600	than what you have with a solar or wind in fact i like you know it's about one to a thousand or
2569600	2576000	two thousand in terms of the square footage you need and i like to tell people you know i i ran
2576000	2580560	five miles this morning so and there was a little bit of wind it was cloudy so if you had a solar
2580560	2587600	panel it would have helped you anyway but think about sun and wind you can go out and enjoy them
2588240	2594240	the breeze which tells you they don't have much energy if they don't you know bring you great
2594240	2601520	harm this wind is so energy poor that you can stand out in the wind not be bothered you can stand out
2601520	2607040	in the sun and not be bothered but go try to stand in the boiler of a natural gas fire power plant
2607040	2612640	you'd be burnt to a crisp that's the kind of energy you need to push electrons and that's the
2612640	2619600	amount of energy that can be done or that process can be done in a very small environmental footprint
2619600	2626720	that then allows the rest of the environment to to not be interfered with by this energy production
2626720	2633440	but look at windmill and solar panel farms not only are they just ugly but they do cause
2633440	2638320	tremendous environmental damage in their construction and maintenance
2640960	2645280	what are the long-term effects i'm talking decades from now
2646720	2652800	if we just continue to get our energy from fossil fuels how bad can it get
2652960	2660400	well let me start how good can you talk about people that will have access to affordable energy
2660400	2664480	so they're going to live longer and they're going to live better lives you have access to this
2665120	2671360	the impact on the climate i think is what is about the only thing you think of is uh well the sea
2671360	2675600	level is going to continue to rise has been rising for several hundred years so it's it's going to
2675600	2683520	continue to rise and at a manageable rate by the way um and the atmosphere it might warm
2683520	2692400	some more uh but certainly not in terms of that catastrophic effect that will cause us to
2693840	2702800	lose our ability to thrive i'm just very i'm pretty optimistic you know people are clever
2702800	2706320	and they can figure out how to adapt to whatever is going to happen
2707040	2711520	the real issues i deal with as a state climatologists are the extreme events
2711520	2718080	that we know are going to happen that you're not ready for i mean that flood that happened
2718080	2723440	you know 50 years ago is going to come back again and it's going to cause some real problems
2723440	2728640	if you don't build your infrastructure and put your houses where they can be safe
2728640	2733680	or industry uh if you don't build up on the coast too much so that you won't be clobbered
2733680	2739200	by a hurricane or something like that so it's these kind of natural extreme events that we're
2739200	2744880	far more vulnerable to right now than some small and gradual change that the climate system might
2744880	2752960	undergo i did read somewhere that someone has asked you and i'm sure you must get it a lot
2752960	2756800	whether you get any funding from the fossil fuel industry do you
2757840	2766000	no i do not and i made that decision way back in the 19 early 1990s so that uh you know someone
2766000	2771840	can come to me and and a fossil fuel i might make a fossil fuel company mad by some of
2772800	2779440	information i've produced but so be it if i can then put my head to bed at night and not be worried
2779440	2786400	about did i uh accommodate some agenda somewhere i'm just after what the observations say can i
2786400	2791920	build the best observational data set to answer the questions of climate that we have and uh and
2791920	2797680	that's that's what i want to do i suppose one of the biggest tragedies about it would be that it
2797680	2803840	would discredit the real science and the the fundamental research that you're doing just
2803840	2809040	that it'll be a non-starter because people will immediately just yeah and that's unfortunate
2809040	2815040	because the perception then is that well if a fossil fuel company paid someone to do some
2815040	2819840	research they really wanted to know the answer about something and this person was completely
2819840	2826560	honest did the work properly and provided the answer to the fossil fuel companies is as you said
2826560	2833520	is well that answer would be tainted because it came from a fossil fuel company well hello think
2833520	2840000	about what environmental advocacy groups and pressure groups do all of the time they pay
2840000	2849120	tremendous sums to people so they can come up with an answer that gives them their leverage in
2849120	2856000	claiming this is a catastrophic problem but so i can take that at least perception off the table
2856640	2862720	lastly are you aware of any ways in which geoengineering could possibly be affecting
2863360	2870000	the natural balance of things is it being done more than we're aware of
2871520	2876640	and could it backfire anytime humans do something they're going to have an impact
2877520	2881760	there's just no question about that so you could call that geoengineering but inadvertent
2882320	2890160	we have made some desert valleys cooler because now we irrigate crops so we've
2891040	2897440	you know taken water that fell someplace and moved it to another place and so that's a bit
2897440	2904400	of geoengineering there and that by the way a lot of those places feed a lot of the world so
2904400	2911600	you can't say it's bad i suppose but the other question about geoengineering is can we do something
2911600	2918000	to prevent a perceived problem here and that's the real danger i think because you don't know the
2918000	2923920	consequences of when you start tinkering with a very complex and dynamical system and so i would
2923920	2933040	say stay away from that suppose someone did a big geo geoengineering experiment and it was and
2933040	2938960	something bad happened somewhere well that country would sue the world and say look you made this
2938960	2944000	bad thing happen to us you are liable and so then we're getting nowhere in terms of
2944720	2950800	preventing some problem on the planet
