0	9280	I'm Nanja Swart of 4Basees.com. Dr. Patrick Moe joins us, co-founder and former leader of Greenpeace and leader in the international environmental field.
9280	13440	For over four decades, Dr. Moe, it's really, really a pleasure to have you with us.
14160	17600	Thanks for having me on, Nadja. There's lots to talk about these days.
17600	25600	Let's start with the story of how you co-founded Greenpeace, you know, what inspired you and also,
25680	31760	at the time, what was the state of the environment and the public's perception thereof?
32960	40000	Well, as a child, I don't think the word environment was ever spoken, and certainly ecology was never
40000	45600	mentioned. Even when we started Greenpeace, the word ecology was not being used in the popular
45600	53920	press, but environment was by that time, of course. I grew up in absolute wilderness on a floating village
54560	60480	in a small bay on northern Vancouver Island with nothing but water and forest around.
61440	68960	And no road came to that village. Everything came by boat from, and the boats had to navigate open
68960	75360	ocean on the west coast of Vancouver Island in the Pacific to get into our harbor. So it was,
75360	82000	it was a completely unique childhood that I had there, and, but the school only went to grade
82080	88320	eight. I went to school by boat every day because our floating village was about two miles from the
88320	93040	fishing village, which was on the land. And there was a small one-room school house with
93680	99200	somewhere between eight and 12 children in the average year in all, all eight grades.
100400	105600	And I saw I went grade one to eight there, and then was sent to boarding school in Vancouver
105600	111200	to a sort of English style boarding school, what they call public schools in England.
112000	117760	And I boarded there, and my parents would come a couple times a year to see me. And then I'd go
117760	122480	home in the summer back to Winter Harbor and work in the logging camp that my father owned.
123440	130720	So that's how I, my childhood, but I didn't realize that I had been in nature
132640	137600	naturally. It wasn't like something special. It was where I lived. And when I
138400	145600	became sort of acidified, I realized how lucky I had been. And, and, and, and went into life
145600	151280	science just naturally that because I was interested in birds and animals and the ocean and shells,
151280	157920	shellfish and fish, and I fished all my life. And so I,
160640	166240	I, I did a PhD in ecology eventually after doing a Bachelor of Science in Forestry and
166240	173280	Biology. And so I had, I was pretty thick into life science already by the time I was 20.
174160	179440	And then I, while I was doing my PhD, I heard about this little group that was starting to meet
179440	184640	in the basement of the Unitarian Church in Vancouver, which is a church that accepts
184640	192560	people from all religions. And, and even if you don't have a religion like me, it accepted you.
193280	200640	So I joined this group as a fledgling group of people. We all were pretty much hippies
200640	205920	by the looks of us, but everybody actually was a pretty professional oriented person. There were
205920	213680	writers and doctors and lawyers and ecologists and etc. And I guess I was the leading life
213680	219600	scientist in, in that early group, because we had, it wasn't about life science. It was about
219600	227520	stopping nuclear testing at the beginning. And so we sailed a boat across the North Pacific Ocean
227520	235920	in September 71 to protest against the five megaton hydrogen bomb the United States was going
235920	242400	to detonate. And we managed to get arrested by the Coast Guard and get on Walter Cronkite's evening
242400	247440	news nationally in the United States. And pretty soon tens of thousands of people were marching
248240	253360	against the bomb. And the day that bomb was detonated, people came from both sides of the
253360	258960	border to join hands and shut the border down for a day between all across Canada. I mean,
258960	266240	that's 4,000 miles or whatever. And every border crossing was shut down. And it was a really big
266240	272320	demonstration. And it's a long time ago now. So hardly anybody remembers it because they weren't
272320	280400	born yet, but many, many people. And that began Greenpeace. And then we went, we won. President
280400	286800	Nixon canceled the, the, the future tests of nuclear weapons in Alaska. That was the last time
286800	292560	the United States detonated a hydrogen bomb. It was very significant. And also the, the,
292560	299520	the beginning of the environmental movement was happening right there. And so then we went against
299520	304640	French atmospheric nuclear testing in the South Pacific. The French public didn't even know that
304640	310000	their government was still testing nuclear weapons down there. It was never printed in because the
310000	317760	government owned all the press that controlled it. And so we went to Paris and, and demonstrated in
317760	325120	Notre Dame Cathedral while our boat was on its way to Murroir Atole in French, in French Polynesia
325120	330240	where they were detonating these bombs in the air and sending radiation around the whole world.
330240	336560	It took two years, but we stopped it. And so, but a lot of people thought we must be commies if
337280	341920	we were trying to stop US and French nuclear testing and weren't going after the Russians.
342560	349280	Well, going after the Russians, we'd come out in a coffin. So it didn't make any sense for us to
349440	358000	Russians should be doing that, but not us because we were the enemy. And so it did have that element
358000	362640	to it. So we didn't get much support, of course, from the United States government or the French
362640	368000	government for that matter, but we beat it. We beat them. And, and again, this was at the height of
368000	373840	the Cold War and the height of the nuclear arms race. And that was the pinnacle of it too. It,
374400	380880	it eased off after that because partly because of the atmosphere we had created and getting people
380880	387040	aware of the how dangerous the situation was that the, and what a nuclear war really would do
388000	398880	to our world. And we're sort of in a space like that now in a little bit. It's as close as it's
398880	405600	been to that kind of atmosphere since then, I would say. But on the other hand, I think people
405600	411760	have thought enough about how much ruin there would be not to the other side, but to your side too,
412560	418320	if ever such a thing happened. So I'm a bit optimistic on that front, but not very optimistic
418320	427360	on the energy front. And so we, we then went on just in and many of our followers thought what
427360	434560	kind of crazy goose are you going to be saving whales after, after you, after you stopped nuclear
434560	441440	war, you're now going to save the whales. What's that got to do with anything? And, and so we lost
441440	447440	a few followers, but we set out into the Pacific for four years in a row every summer when the
447440	452960	Russians were killing and the Japanese were killing 30,000 large whales every year still
453520	462160	in the 1970s, mainly for their oil and for pet food. And the oil of the sperm whale is a special
462160	469040	type of oil. It's used in fine machinery, but it's also possible to grow a bean, which has
469040	475920	it just as good a oil in it. And then you don't have to slaughter a whale. And so we stopped that
476880	482240	by, by 1981, whaling was banned in the entire world because of what we did. We got out and
482240	487120	got in front of the harpoons and the pictures of us in a little boat in front of the harpoon with
487120	491840	the whale being killed went around, went around the world. And that's what really made us famous.
491840	496240	We weren't that famous when we were doing the nuclear testing stuff. It was, you know,
496240	502000	if they got in the newspapers, but when we did the Save the Whales campaign, we just got everybody
502000	508880	excited and interested in being able to do such a thing as to stop that. And because it was the
508880	516640	Japanese and the Russians, it was sort of balanced in terms of East and West. And we didn't have that
516640	523760	same attitude of thinking that we're a bunch of communists because we were actually going against
523760	531760	the communists. And that's what made us catch on fire and pretty soon millions of dollars
532000	536320	were involved and people were just throwing money at us and we started doing some really
537440	544480	good stuff. We stopped the capture of work of whales. I was the leader of that campaign
545360	551680	on Vancouver Island where the last attempt to capture an orca whale was thwarted by us.
552400	556400	And that was the end of that. They'd already taken nearly a third of the population
556400	562800	of the west coast of North America. They did after that start taking some whales from Iceland,
562800	569920	but that too has ended, I believe. And I don't think anybody is catching work of whales anymore.
569920	576800	We got to that point and we were famous around the world. But then we turned to a very serious
576800	584400	problem, which was the damaging of the rivers and lakes, particularly with toxic waste from
584400	588960	factories, especially in Europe. North America had adopted some pretty good
590160	598480	air and water pollution control laws in 1972 under Nixon. Again, it's funny and I mean,
599600	607200	Nixon is remembered for the Watergate break-in, but he actually stopped nuclear testing and stopped
608160	614560	killing whales and stopped toxic waste. He was behind all of those things.
617600	624080	The rivers of Europe, though, like the Elbe and the Rhine and the Thames, they were all poisoned.
624080	629440	There was almost no life in them because factories were putting their waste into the river under
629440	635680	water where no one could see it in a pipe. And we took a smaller boat than the ones we'd used on
635680	641200	the high seas. They were like 150-foot boats. We took more like a 75-foot boat that could go up the
641200	648800	rivers and we put scuba divers in the water to block the pipes where the waste was coming out
648800	658000	and it backed up into the factory and that image and that fact intrigued the media. And we got a
658000	664160	lot of press for plugging the pipes of these industries and today there's fish in all those
664160	673120	rivers. And so, you know, it was really a shame when Greenpeace went bad largely because it was
673120	679440	hijacked by the political left because they saw the money and the political power that we'd created.
679440	685360	We weren't political particularly. I've never been political. I've avoided it like the plague because
685360	691200	I believe that we should just judge every situation on its merit and not just say,
691200	696080	I'm a Republican so I support this, that and the other thing. Or I'm a Democrat and I support
696080	701600	this, that or the other thing. It doesn't make sense to me. I understand that it's legitimate
701600	709360	to have political parties. I just don't want to be in one. And I'd rather be a free agent,
710240	716080	so to say, to make up my own mind and to study things. I always say when I see a situation or
716080	721520	a problem, I don't just look at it from here. I walk all the way around it and look at it from
721520	729680	every direction I can imagine to try to understand it better. And now we've got a situation where
729680	736960	politics and science are being confused with each other. People are saying that there's a consensus
736960	745360	that humans are causing a global catastrophe, a global extreme weather and all this stuff, that
745360	751200	it's caused. So there's a consensus, is there? Well, that's not how science works. I mean,
751200	757120	if you look at any invention or discovery that's been done, that's why there's a Nobel Prize to
758240	765520	give to individuals who have exceptionally discovered something. Things aren't discovered by
765520	772800	committees. Rules are made by committees after the discovery has been made. But to separate
772800	777280	science from politics is absolutely essential and it's there being confused,
778800	785440	totally in the Western world. I think that, you know, I don't want to live in Russia or China
785440	791440	particularly, although Moscow is such a beautiful city. I don't want to live there particularly
791440	797520	because of their political structure. But I think they do a better job in some ways of discerning
797520	804160	the difference between knowledge and politics and because politics is really just about policy.
805200	810880	But if you make policy based on bad science, you get bad policy. You can even get bad policy
810880	819040	based on good science if you're not smart. But the truth of the matter is that there is no
819040	824080	hard evidence that carbon dioxide is causing anything to happen to the temperature of the
824080	831680	earth. There's none. It is totally theoretical. But the reason I called my book Fake Invisible
831680	839920	Catastrophes and Threats of Doom is because they are focusing on things that nobody can see
840720	851120	and making up stories about. It's impossible because you can't see it. The first rule of
851120	857760	science is observation. You have to observe something. It doesn't have to be with your eyes.
857760	863760	It can be with a microscope or with a microphone or it can be with any tool you can imagine.
863760	868640	Radiation is the other one besides carbon dioxide. Those are the two main ones that are in the
868640	876880	invisible category. So they blame everything on carbon dioxide practically. And then the other
876960	883280	category is remote. And that's why polar bears and coral reefs are the icons. Because again,
883280	890320	hardly anybody can see them or go there. Who goes to the North Pole and counts all the polar bears?
890320	897760	When in fact, and why is it that the media never mentions the treaty that was signed in 1973?
897760	903760	Like it wasn't in a thousand years ago. It was in 1973. The treaty was signed
904560	913440	among all the polar nations, which are six, to end the unrestricted hunting of polar bears in 1973.
914560	919360	Because wildlife biologists went to the governments and said they're killing. It's too
919360	924560	easy for rich people to go up there in a plane and hire a guide and get a polar bear or two.
924560	927120	And there was no restriction. They could take as many as they wanted.
928080	934240	So that was ended and and in force and has been ever since. And that's why the polar bear
934240	940160	population has grown three to five times larger than it was then. Which now I don't even believe
940160	945200	because all we see is photographs of lone polar bears on sheets of ice that are about to
946240	955120	to melt. Yes, their common name is sea bears as in SEA bears. They when they jump off an iceberg
955120	961120	and start swimming, they know where they're going. It's not as if they're going to swim out to see
961120	969840	and drown. More people drown every year than polar bears do. And it is ridiculous to suggest
969840	976000	that a polar bear doesn't know how to figure out things. You see, we know that polar bears can
976000	983360	survive through much warmer periods than what we're in now. Because the three interglacial periods
983360	988480	that came before this one, which is known as the Holocene, it's about 10,000 years into it now.
989120	994720	And so it's about time for it to end like in the next hundreds of years somewhere. We're in an ice
994720	1002160	age, but the glacial the glacial maximums of which there have been 40 or more have all occurred
1002160	1008640	within the last 2.6 million years in the Pleistocene Ice Age. We are now in an interglacial period,
1008640	1014240	but it's still colder than it was for the 250 million years prior to that. Everything is upside
1014240	1018880	down, Nadia. Everything's upside down. They're saying there's too much CO2 when there's never
1018880	1023760	been so little. They're saying it's too hot when it's actually colder than it's been almost a whole
1023760	1028640	time of the earth right now, because that's why all that ice is on the poles. There's a lot, you
1028640	1034160	know, and they show a picture of the ice in the summer after six months of sunshine 24 hours a day.
1034160	1039840	But in the winter, every square inch of the Arctic Ocean plus ocean down even further south
1039840	1045120	than that is frozen solid. They never show you that one. It's still that way every winter.
1046000	1050800	And they've got people thinking that the ice is disappearing in the Arctic
1051920	1058720	and the Antarctic, which it's not. One of the most dire some doom and gloom predictions made by
1059440	1068400	climate alarmists is that we are in the midst of a abrupt climate change. And it's going to be
1068400	1074080	methane from the Arctic, which will lead to human extinction. Some scientists such as
1074080	1081200	Professor Guy McPherson believes it'll be by 2026. And you've recently said that
1082160	1086560	there's so far from the truth. How is it possible that there are two
1087600	1094640	sad conflicting theories? Is there not sufficient data and evidence that can be used to refute
1094640	1101280	disastrous claims like that of Professor McPherson? Yes, there are. It's not difficult. It's not
1101280	1108960	difficult to explain the history of the temperature and the CO2 on the earth, that people only go
1108960	1117760	back to 1850 when industrialization began. And they say it's like as if they think the
1117760	1125680	earth began then. It actually began 4.6 billion years ago. And when modern life emerged, which was
1125680	1132080	about half a billion years ago, before that it had all been the little tiny unicellular plankton in
1132080	1139840	the sea. But sexual reproduction occurred about 2.5 billion years ago. The photosynthesis occurred
1139840	1147360	even earlier than that. So life developed a lot of what we would consider to be very miraculous
1147360	1154000	processes early on. But when multicellular life emerged, that was the what called the
1154000	1162640	Cambrian explosion about 540 million years ago. Larger life forms came into being with
1162640	1169680	organs and flippers, but they didn't have any shells or backbones. They were all just like
1169680	1177680	jellyfish at first. And then gradually, gradually many of these multicellular organisms learned
1177680	1182800	to combine calcium with carbon dioxide in the ocean and make shells for themselves.
1183760	1188080	If you start thinking about all the marine creatures, a huge percentage of them,
1189040	1195040	including the corals, which is about 50% of all the calcium carbonate that is produced
1195040	1201840	by marine life. All of the limestone in the earth's crust was made by life. And the marble
1202000	1209360	and the chalk, the white cliffs of Dover are made of the skeletons of coccolithophores,
1209360	1216480	which are unicellular plant that makes a shell for itself. And you can imagine how important that
1216480	1224960	would be. Instead of just being a naked blob of jelly, you now have a thick hard shell to
1224960	1233280	surround yourself. And it's like a knight in armor. And so that was a huge advance in the
1233280	1240960	evolution of life. Like there's the crabs and snails and barnacles and clams and oysters. And
1240960	1250400	it goes on and on and on. And the coral reefs. And so that was a huge benefit. But unfortunately,
1250400	1256720	inadvertently, it meant that the CO2 in the ocean and the atmosphere, because they are connected
1256720	1261600	at the surface of the ocean, the ocean and the atmosphere are in equilibrium with regard to
1261600	1267120	their CO2 content, the ocean containing about 50 times as much CO2 as the atmosphere.
1268560	1273280	So when these shells started pulling carbon dioxide out of the ocean to make their shells,
1274000	1278880	it started going down from about 5,000 parts per million at the time that that shell
1278880	1290400	process was invented to 180 parts from 6,000, 5,000 to 6,000 to 180 at the peak of the most recent
1290400	1298000	glacial advance. And then this went 20,000 years ago. It went down to went down to 180 parts per
1298000	1303520	million, which is only 50 parts per million above the death of plants. Because plants don't just
1303520	1312480	need CO2 to live, they need a certain concentration of it. And 180 parts per million is only 0.018%.
1314560	1319840	And we all currently, according to most sources, we are 0.04.
1320560	1329360	Yeah, 0.425 or so. Yes, we have increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 50%.
1329600	1335040	And this is one of the best things that has happened in the history of life.
1336640	1342720	And humans did it inadvertently, just like the shellfish inadvertently caused the CO2 to decline
1342720	1350080	so drastically over half a billion years. We have come back and saved life from a certain demise.
1351200	1355120	No other species could do this, could find the fossil fuels.
1355600	1362320	It highlights our ability to adapt. And we are also evil for doing this.
1363280	1368560	And it's kind of like a death wish, I think. I don't know why these things come about, but there
1368560	1374240	was a time when people burned women as witches with absolutely no evidence whatsoever of which
1374240	1380320	we even was, right? And throwing virgins into volcanoes was fairly popular back in the day.
1380320	1389120	And all through history, there have been ogrums. And the Germans murdering 8 million
1389120	1398000	people of a certain genetic extraction. I mean, whoa, we can be evil. But the thing is,
1398000	1403440	this thing about the climate, it's the people who are calling us deniers who are actually the
1403440	1412080	evil ones, because when you call a person a denier, we're not denying that the climate changes.
1413520	1419760	So why don't they use straight language? You accuse us of what we are actually believing,
1419760	1424640	which is that CO2 is a net benefit to life on Earth. That's what we believe.
1425920	1433120	We're just about to be joined by one of the winners of the 2022 Nobel Prize for Physics,
1433200	1439440	in our CO2 coalition in Harlington, Virginia, which is right on the border of Washington, DC.
1440160	1445200	And I was a founding director along with Will Happer and Dick Linsen.
1445760	1451120	I interviewed Dr. Linsen last week and Professor Happer last year. And I actually
1451120	1456320	wanted to mention earlier, when you referred to it as a death wish, that Professor Happer said that
1456960	1468080	this drive towards net zero, it's a suicide pact. Correct. And Dr. Linsen said last week that
1469280	1472960	it's almost as if the environmentalists have decided to commit suicide.
1473760	1481520	If net zero were actually achieved, that is the end of net amounts of CO2 going into the atmosphere.
1482480	1484080	How close do you think we are to that?
1485920	1489840	It's never going to happen. The only way it could happen is if we adopted nuclear
1489840	1497200	energy on a large scale. And that could be done. In 100 years, we could basically get off of at
1497200	1506160	least 50 to 75% of the fossil fuels we're using today. Everything stationary can be provided
1506160	1513440	by nuclear energy, heat and electricity. My concern here is where will we get our CO2 from?
1515680	1524960	We get our CO2 from the atmosphere in the ocean. And at this point in history of the earth,
1524960	1530880	it has been declining steadily for at least half a billion years. Up and down, just like the
1530880	1537280	temperature goes up and down, but generally we are now, we're in the place to see an ice age.
1537280	1541120	This is one of 40 or more interglacial periods where it gets a little bit warmer
1541760	1548000	than it is during the glacial advances. Canada was covered in over a mile of ice from one side to
1548000	1555040	the other during the most recent glaciation. And so was it during all the previous ones,
1555040	1561280	of which there were 40. And in between, you get a situation where it's halfway as livable.
1562560	1568160	Canada, that is, because less than half of it is lived in. It's working on 90% of Canadians
1568160	1573920	are within 100 miles of the US border for a good reason. The further north you go, the more inhospitable
1573920	1579920	it becomes. People forget that humans are a tropical species. We are not an arctic species.
1580640	1584960	We're not polar bears or penguins. We evolved at the equator, and if it weren't for fire,
1584960	1590800	clothing, and shelter, we couldn't have moved out of Africa. It's the only reason we were able to do so.
1592480	1597200	So, and those are all three very important things in our lives, fire, shelter, and clothing,
1597760	1601680	especially if you live in a cold place. You know, I'm in Baja, California,
1602480	1608320	which is part of Mexico right now, and it's a beautiful warm day, but it gets cold enough here
1608320	1616560	in the winter down into the teens and tens that if people came here and didn't have fire,
1616560	1622240	shelter, and clothing, they would die out very quickly. Even here, and I'm at the Tropic of
1622240	1628560	Cancer, humans could not live at the Tropic of Cancer without fire, shelter, and clothing.
1628560	1633600	And even at the equator, there's nights that are cold enough that you want to have a big
1633600	1639120	animal skin on you while you're sleeping. You know, you could call that clothing.
1639760	1644800	But I'd like to talk about coral reefs for a bit, because there is this myth that they're going to
1644800	1650960	die if it gets too hot. Funnily enough, though, the most biodiverse coral reefs in the world are in
1650960	1657200	the warmest ocean of the world, which is the Indonesian archipelago, and that's where there's
1657200	1663280	over 600 species of coral and over 2,000 species of reef-ish. By far the most biodiverse in the world,
1663280	1668560	the Caribbean is the next most diverse, and it happens to be the second warmest ocean in the
1668560	1675840	world. So the truth is, if the world warms, the corals will expand to a much larger range than
1675840	1682640	they occupy today. That's the truth. And even the people who study coral try to avoid saying
1682640	1686480	that, because if you say that, it means you don't believe that global warming is going to destroy
1686480	1690800	the coral, right? And if you don't believe that global warming is going to destroy the coral,
1690800	1696000	then you're not on our side. And then you won't get any more money from the politicians through
1696000	1700240	the bureaucrats into the universities. That's where the quiet side of this whole thing is.
1700240	1706400	Everybody hears the commotion from the media, and from the greens, and from the world economic
1706400	1712320	forum and all these people. But where the real business is taking place is where politicians
1712320	1718000	are instructing their bureaucrats to give scientists in the universities where 80% of all
1718080	1723120	the research in the United States is done, is in universities. And if you're a professor in a
1723120	1727280	university, you don't go along with the climate thing, you're not getting any money, period.
1728000	1734880	And with few exceptions, very few exceptions. And so, and this is the consensus is being paid for,
1735760	1742000	right? And bought, bought and paid for. And that's what's going on. And so then all the noise comes
1742960	1749840	from the scientists, from the media, from the greens, and they're all includes together making
1749840	1756400	a whole pile of money out of this. And it is, there have always been doomsday scenarios.
1757360	1762480	And yet, for some reason, doom has never occurred. I mean, like the end of the earth,
1762480	1767200	you know, it's just never seems to come about, no matter how often you predict it.
1767200	1775520	You just feel like going, wake up, people, wake up. Nothing like a good disaster to make the news.
1778000	1783120	It's human nature's latest thing. Everything is fine today. So we'd have nothing to say.
1784560	1790800	That is one of the arguments that's the very devoted to the narrative in terms of climate change.
1790800	1798320	People argue it when it comes to scientists that disagree with the consensus, that they're not
1798320	1803600	going to be around for long enough to have, you know, their predictions and advice end up killing
1803600	1809040	people. It's not going to upset them. Well, most of the people who like myself are willing to tell
1809040	1818240	the truth about this are not in the, in the clutches of some economic necessity. If you're
1818240	1829760	working for a living and you defy the narrative of consensus about climate disaster, you're,
1829760	1836560	you're, you know, you're going to be shunned. And, and I am shunned by these people and they call
1836560	1843360	me names. That's all they can seem to come up with is calling me names. And, and I don't see
1843360	1848080	what that has to do with science myself. I've never worked for the fossil fuel industry in my
1848080	1852800	life. But everyone, what else did you do? Yeah, I don't know why. I mean, I hadn't,
1852800	1858160	there's no record of it. I haven't hidden anything in my, I've been a very open person all my life.
1858160	1864800	I've never told a lie. And, and that is, that is, that is the truth. I don't tell lies.
1866480	1871440	Some people do. I think, and some people, I think they know they're lying. I'm not sure.
1871520	1879040	You can't, you can't see inside a person's brain. But the truth of the matter is, is there is no
1879040	1884000	evidence of a climate catastrophe. All they're talking about now is extreme weather events,
1884000	1888320	which have been going on since the beginning of time. And forest fires, for goodness sakes,
1889520	1896960	most forest fires are caused by people carelessly failing to put out campfires and throwing
1896960	1901040	cigarette butts out the window and that sort of thing is a lot of them. But lightning has been
1901040	1908400	here forever, right? And lightning is, causes forest fires. But the reasons that these fires
1908400	1914160	are so severe today is due to mismanagement. If you, if you imagine back in the day when I was
1914160	1921760	talking about when all, all the energy was from wood, every end of every summer, the people went
1921760	1926640	out from cities and towns and gathered all the dead wood in the forest. That's the first day
1926640	1933280	would take because it's the easiest to take and it's already dry. So this really reduces the,
1933280	1938720	the chance of a catastrophic wildfire going up into the crown of the trees and starting the whole
1938720	1946240	place ablaze. That is, if you look at the United States, they, in the West, a huge amount of land
1946240	1950720	is owned by the federal government, national parks, national forests, Bureau of Land Management land.
1951360	1957600	So it's controlled from Washington where most of the politicians are from the east of the Mississippi.
1958320	1963760	Most of the federal lands are west of the Mississippi. Idaho is 70% federally owned.
1963760	1970880	So they don't have, they don't care really about what happens there. And so the, the, the forests
1970880	1978080	in the east of the country down along the, the southern states, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana,
1978080	1983360	they're covered in forest. They almost never have forest fires because they're managed properly.
1983920	1989680	Because the people who own them want to get the wood, not to have a charred forest left behind.
1989680	1994720	The people who are, who are owning the federal lands in the western United States don't really care
1994720	2000320	that much. And then they can use that as a way of saying, look what the climate has done to our
2000320	2004400	environment. It's causing these forest fires. No, you are causing the forest fires because you
2004480	2010720	won't let people manage them properly. What got temperate to changes? IPCC reports. Dr. Linsen said
2010720	2015120	that there's really actually just one working group that deals with science. And now they did not
2015120	2020000	actually come up with anything that posed an existential threat. Scientists will look at the
2020000	2026240	data. They won't come up with doomsday predictions, but they'll leave it open-ended and leave the
2026240	2032960	politicians do what they will. Now the IPCC's reports don't say that there's doomsday coming.
2033920	2038320	They don't say that. They say the temperature has risen one degree in the last 250 years.
2039360	2044480	Which is true. We're in a warming period. It's a slight warming period. We've been in cooling
2044480	2049840	periods and warming periods all through the Holocene. The Holocene was warmer than it is now,
2049840	2056560	8,000 years ago, until about 6,000 years ago. It was warmer than it is now, even though it's
2056560	2062240	getting warmer now than it was 200 years ago. It goes up and down. But sometimes it goes up and
2062240	2069280	down downwards. And sometimes it goes up and down upwards. Just a fact. It wobbles. There's cycles
2069280	2075120	on cycles on cycles. And there's El Niño and La Niña. And all of these short cycles. And then
2075120	2079600	there's longer cycles and longer still cycles. And then there's things we just don't even understand
2079600	2086320	at all. Like why the earth went into another ice age 2.6 million years ago. When there was no ice
2086320	2092000	on the earth at all for the 250 million years before that. When the Keru Ice Age ended, which
2092000	2099120	had lasted 100 million years during the Carboniferous period. Extreme weather is one thing. But damage
2099120	2106080	caused to people is another. The number of people being killed by extreme weather has gone down by
2106080	2113760	98% in the last 200 years. It's actually just in the last, it's actually just in the last 100 years
2113760	2121280	since the 1920s. It's been proven that this is the case. And most people who died from weather in
2121280	2130480	those days was by starvation. Because what the weather did to their crops. It's unbelievable
2130480	2137360	how much less danger there is for people today than there was just 100 years ago. Much less
2137360	2142880	danger. And a lot of it is because of fossil fuels and nitrogen fertilizer.
2145600	2151440	People, I mean it's only 100 years they have to look out there. And to see that there's definite
2151440	2157920	proof that on a per capita basis there's been a 98% reduction in death from extreme weather.
2157920	2165120	And that includes all extreme weather of every kind. It's just been published. And it is not
2165120	2169760	being carried by the mainstream media. I mean they should have this as their top story.
2170880	2175840	In 2010 this is 40 years after you co-founded Greenpeace. The organization comes out with a
2175840	2181920	statement saying that you were in fact not a founding member. What is it that you observed
2181920	2188240	in the organization that led to you walking away? I mean it must have been a really difficult
2188240	2192240	decision to walk away from something that you were that sincerely passionate about.
2193040	2198160	It was an easy decision to make because I had no choice. I had no choice for two reasons.
2198880	2205040	First, much of the environment, we started out with a fairly strong humanitarian orientation to
2205040	2209360	save civilization from nuclear war. That must mean you care about people at least a little bit.
2210000	2215200	And it came to the point where the environmental movement including Greenpeace was basically
2215200	2220400	characterizing humans as the enemies of nature. We are the enemies of the earth. It was sort of like
2221360	2227200	human beings are the only evil species on the planet. And even cockroaches are better than we
2227200	2233760	type thing. So this is the philosophical level, high philosophical level of this judgmental idea
2233760	2240560	that human beings are the enemies of nature. And then came a campaign proposal from people who
2240560	2245600	had no science education. I was the only one who had a formal science education on the international
2245600	2251120	board of Greenpeace for the whole of those 15 years. My fellow directors, none of whom had any
2251120	2259360	formal science education, decided that Greenpeace should start a campaign to ban chlorine worldwide.
2259360	2268720	That was the slogan. And I said to them, you guys, you gotta be a little more nuanced than that because
2269360	2275280	chlorine happens to be one of the most important elements for human life that there is. Table salt
2275280	2281600	for example, is sodium chloride. And it is an essential nutrient. Chlorine, yes, we're talking
2281600	2291040	about chlorine, which is one of the halogens, which includes fluorine, bromine, chlorine, iodine,
2291040	2296640	and arginine, I think it's called or something like that. This group of chemicals is one of the
2296640	2303600	most reactive group of chemicals in the whole periodic table. It's aggressive. And of course,
2303600	2310320	we know that elemental chlorine gas can kill you really quickly because it combines with everything,
2310320	2318000	just right like that. The reason there's no chlorine gas around is because it's combined
2318000	2325600	with something else like sodium. It doesn't. It can't exist freely in the atmosphere. It has to
2325600	2331920	get attached to something. And it gets attached to lots of things, some of which are the most
2331920	2337520	important things in medicine. 85% of all our pharmaceuticals are made with chlorine chemistry,
2338160	2344640	and 25% of our medicines actually have chlorine in them. And table salt, sodium chloride,
2345280	2352160	which is an essential nutrient for all life, that's why Gandhi marched to the sea to make salt
2353120	2358800	was because the British were taxing the poor people in India for something that was essential.
2359520	2365520	And so it was one of his greatest achievements was this making salt by the sea.
2366320	2372560	And then in addition to that, adding chlorine to drinking water was the biggest advance in the
2372560	2378640	history of public health and to swimming pools and spas. You don't have a hot tub without chlorine
2378640	2383360	or bromine pucks floating around in the thing. You don't do that because you don't want to spread
2383440	2390080	disease. And so I'm going, you guys, you're still going to do this? Have a campaign to van
2390080	2396320	chlorine worldwide? Yep, we're going ahead. Once we came to the issue of toxicity and chemicals,
2396320	2401120	you have to have some science. You don't need any science to want to stop nuclear war. You don't
2401120	2405520	need any science to save 30,000 whales from being killed every year. You don't have to be a whale
2405520	2412160	scientist for that. But if you're going to deal with chemistry, you have to have some science,
2412160	2419600	because the first rule of chemistry, in many ways, is the toxicity is in the dose.
2421120	2426240	So table salt is essential at a small dose. Then you can take too much of it,
2426240	2429920	but it still doesn't hurt you. You don't need that much of it, but it doesn't hurt you.
2429920	2437920	Then it starts to hurt you. If you took a cup of salt and put it in your stomach, you're dead.
2437920	2441600	Also in the final analysis, Greenpeace was hijacked by the political left,
2441600	2445600	because they were smarter at politics than we were, because we weren't really politicians.
2446560	2453680	We were campaigners. And we knew how to do that. We knew how to get people's attention.
2453680	2457600	We knew what the real issues were. And all of a sudden, these guys are saying that chlorine
2457600	2466720	should be banned. And it was just a fundraising program based on incorrect information. So how
2466720	2472800	could I be involved in that? So there was no choice. I had to go. I always say I blame
2472800	2479120	McTaggart. David McTaggart became our chairman. He was kind of a very, very interesting person.
2480480	2488320	He was friends with the Agat Khan and with the head of the science division in Moscow for Russia.
2488320	2492640	All kind of high-level people, the person who founded CNN.
2496720	2505280	He was a real mover in society, but he had no science. And he really believed that everybody
2505280	2510960	was going to be poisoned by chemicals, the modern civilization, and all the plastics.
2510960	2514560	You know how people say that they act as though plastic is toxic?
2514720	2520160	Right? Well, is that why we wrap our food in it? Go on the internet and look for
2522400	2532480	plastic in the stomachs of albatross chicks. And you'll see these made-up pictures of a dead
2532480	2539920	albatross chick slaced open, full of plastic. Right? This does not happen in the world.
2540800	2548560	It is true. It is true that the parents of albatross chicks in the nest bring bits of hard
2548560	2556000	plastic and other such materials and give it to the chick for its gizzard to grind its food.
2556640	2563440	Birds don't have teeth, so plastic is actually performing a useful function for seabirds.
2563440	2569040	They have two stomachs. One has hard objects in it that when the chicks are in this nest,
2569040	2573840	they can't go out and get it for themselves. But then for the rest of their lives, all birds
2574480	2581200	ingest hard objects of a certain size and shape to put in their gizzards to grind their food,
2581200	2588080	because they have no teeth. They can't chew their food. So if a mother bird gives its chick
2588080	2594960	a squid eight inches long, you know, like that, it goes to the gizzard where it gets ground up,
2594960	2600320	except for the beak of the squid, which is retained as a hard object to continue helping
2600320	2606000	digest the food. And this is all well understood for 60 years. It's all been understood. Scientists
2606000	2610560	at first, when they saw that birds were using plastic as one of the objects that they gave their
2610560	2615920	chicks to digest their food, were worried about it. But they came to realize that it causes no
2615920	2621360	harm. As a matter of fact, it works just as well as pumice stones and pieces of wood and
2621760	2628560	bit nuts that fall off trees into the sea. It's hard to find those hard objects in the sea. There's
2628560	2634480	no pebbles in the sea, whereas on land birds just use pebbles about the size of a marble
2635680	2641680	and smaller. So this is all just total fake. And the other thing that plastic does in the sea is
2641680	2648080	it acts as a substrate, just like driftwood does for marine life to grow on. And then for other
2648160	2653040	species to eat the marine life that's growing on the piece of plastic. It's like a little floating
2653040	2658400	reef. Did you know that there is no such thing as the Pacific Garbage Patch, which I'm sure you've
2658400	2663680	heard of? There isn't such a thing, because it's invisible. It's in the middle of the Pacific Ocean
2663680	2668000	where Noah can look out the window and see whether it really exists. So they made it up and made
2668000	2673360	paintings of it. You go on the internet and look for Great Pacific Garbage Patch. You'll find all
2673360	2679040	these made up cartoon-like things which show this is the Pacific Garbage Patch and they take a brush
2679040	2687040	and paint a big blob on a map of the earth that they made up. And the only thing that is a real
2687040	2692720	picture that claims to be part of the Pacific Garbage Patch right underneath it says this is
2692720	2697280	part of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. I looked at it and it's a big sea of debris in the ocean,
2697280	2702720	huge sea of debris. And I looked and in the background there were mountains. And I'm going,
2702720	2707120	there's no mountains in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It turns out this was the debris that was
2707120	2713280	washed off of Japan during the tsunami that killed 20,000 people. And it was all the towns,
2713280	2717840	the towns all just destroyed. And that's why there were mountains in the background,
2717840	2722640	because that was Japan. And they pretended that it was the Pacific Garbage Patch. It's on the
2722640	2728800	internet. Just go on the internet and say Pacific Garbage Patch, twice the size of Texas, they say,
2728800	2733920	and growing and growing faster than we ever imagined. And it's not true. The most of the
2733920	2739280	plastic in the sea is discarded fishing gear. And that is an issue that should be addressed.
2739280	2745600	But the problem is, is fishermen want their boats to be used for putting fish in and nets in that
2745600	2751440	work, not discarded, not nets they want to get rid of if they're damaged, which happens a lot with
2751440	2756720	nets. So they just throw them overboard. So maybe somebody should get together with the fishing
2756800	2763280	industry and see if they can't help them figure out a way, maybe to hang them off the bow,
2763280	2767440	so that they're not taking up room in the boat. Because the boat, they want the boat for ice and
2767440	2774800	fish. Because boats have a limited amount of room in them, fishing boats. So that's why they throw
2774800	2779360	it away. But it isn't as though people are out there shoveling plastic into the ocean.
2780240	2787840	You know, it's true that plastic gets into rivers. And especially in Southeast Asia,
2787840	2794400	it was really quite awful to see. All of the people who are selling vegetables and stuff are
2794400	2800080	often on the bank of a river. And they just throw everything that they don't want away,
2800080	2803840	rotten food and plastic wrappers. And the whole thing goes into the river.
2804720	2811360	I see that you also wonder what the possible end goal could be. Do you think that the
2811360	2817600	motivation is purely a profit? Because only very few people are benefiting from this.
2817600	2825440	Do you think it's control? I'd say it's more control than money. Yes, I do. I believe it's a
2825440	2835920	basically it's a communist kind of approach to the situation. And I'm not joining, I'm afraid.
2838240	2848640	That's just how I see it. I think many people are innocent, innocently being pulled into this fear.
2849600	2856080	But many people are doing it on purpose and exaggerating it to such an extent.
2857760	2863680	The earth is actually doing quite fine right now. The human species can be immensely proud of
2863680	2870240	itself in retrospect, not because we did it on purpose, but because we have reversed the decline
2870240	2875280	of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which no other species could have done. And this is a good
2875280	2882720	thing, the replenishment. Every molecule of CO2 we emit came from the environment in the first
2882720	2889920	place and was turned into fossil fuels or turned into limestone, which we used to make cement.
2889920	2895520	And that reduces 10% of our CO2 emissions. The other 90% is almost all fossil fuels.
2896480	2902640	And all of that CO2 that we are emitting from the fossil fuels came from the atmosphere in
2902640	2908800	the first place. We are just putting it back where it came from. And when it was there, life flourished.
2910160	2918560	So that's all you need to know. You really don't need to know anything more than that.
