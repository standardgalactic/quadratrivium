00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
I'm Nanja Swart of 4Basees.com. Dr. Patrick Moe joins us, co-founder and former leader of Greenpeace and leader in the international environmental field.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,440
For over four decades, Dr. Moe, it's really, really a pleasure to have you with us.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,600
Thanks for having me on, Nadja. There's lots to talk about these days.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:25,600
Let's start with the story of how you co-founded Greenpeace, you know, what inspired you and also,

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,760
at the time, what was the state of the environment and the public's perception thereof?

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, as a child, I don't think the word environment was ever spoken, and certainly ecology was never

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,600
mentioned. Even when we started Greenpeace, the word ecology was not being used in the popular

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,920
press, but environment was by that time, of course. I grew up in absolute wilderness on a floating village

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,480
in a small bay on northern Vancouver Island with nothing but water and forest around.

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,960
And no road came to that village. Everything came by boat from, and the boats had to navigate open

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,360
ocean on the west coast of Vancouver Island in the Pacific to get into our harbor. So it was,

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,000
it was a completely unique childhood that I had there, and, but the school only went to grade

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,320
eight. I went to school by boat every day because our floating village was about two miles from the

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,040
fishing village, which was on the land. And there was a small one-room school house with

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,200
somewhere between eight and 12 children in the average year in all, all eight grades.

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,600
And I saw I went grade one to eight there, and then was sent to boarding school in Vancouver

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,200
to a sort of English style boarding school, what they call public schools in England.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,760
And I boarded there, and my parents would come a couple times a year to see me. And then I'd go

19
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,480
home in the summer back to Winter Harbor and work in the logging camp that my father owned.

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,720
So that's how I, my childhood, but I didn't realize that I had been in nature

21
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,600
naturally. It wasn't like something special. It was where I lived. And when I

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,600
became sort of acidified, I realized how lucky I had been. And, and, and, and went into life

23
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,280
science just naturally that because I was interested in birds and animals and the ocean and shells,

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,920
shellfish and fish, and I fished all my life. And so I,

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,240
I, I did a PhD in ecology eventually after doing a Bachelor of Science in Forestry and

26
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:53,280
Biology. And so I had, I was pretty thick into life science already by the time I was 20.

27
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,440
And then I, while I was doing my PhD, I heard about this little group that was starting to meet

28
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,640
in the basement of the Unitarian Church in Vancouver, which is a church that accepts

29
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,560
people from all religions. And, and even if you don't have a religion like me, it accepted you.

30
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,640
So I joined this group as a fledgling group of people. We all were pretty much hippies

31
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,920
by the looks of us, but everybody actually was a pretty professional oriented person. There were

32
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:33,680
writers and doctors and lawyers and ecologists and etc. And I guess I was the leading life

33
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,600
scientist in, in that early group, because we had, it wasn't about life science. It was about

34
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:47,520
stopping nuclear testing at the beginning. And so we sailed a boat across the North Pacific Ocean

35
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:55,920
in September 71 to protest against the five megaton hydrogen bomb the United States was going

36
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,400
to detonate. And we managed to get arrested by the Coast Guard and get on Walter Cronkite's evening

37
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,440
news nationally in the United States. And pretty soon tens of thousands of people were marching

38
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,360
against the bomb. And the day that bomb was detonated, people came from both sides of the

39
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,960
border to join hands and shut the border down for a day between all across Canada. I mean,

40
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:26,240
that's 4,000 miles or whatever. And every border crossing was shut down. And it was a really big

41
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,320
demonstration. And it's a long time ago now. So hardly anybody remembers it because they weren't

42
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:40,400
born yet, but many, many people. And that began Greenpeace. And then we went, we won. President

43
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,800
Nixon canceled the, the, the future tests of nuclear weapons in Alaska. That was the last time

44
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,560
the United States detonated a hydrogen bomb. It was very significant. And also the, the,

45
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,520
the beginning of the environmental movement was happening right there. And so then we went against

46
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,640
French atmospheric nuclear testing in the South Pacific. The French public didn't even know that

47
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,000
their government was still testing nuclear weapons down there. It was never printed in because the

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,760
government owned all the press that controlled it. And so we went to Paris and, and demonstrated in

49
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:25,120
Notre Dame Cathedral while our boat was on its way to Murroir Atole in French, in French Polynesia

50
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,240
where they were detonating these bombs in the air and sending radiation around the whole world.

51
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,560
It took two years, but we stopped it. And so, but a lot of people thought we must be commies if

52
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,920
we were trying to stop US and French nuclear testing and weren't going after the Russians.

53
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,280
Well, going after the Russians, we'd come out in a coffin. So it didn't make any sense for us to

54
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:58,000
Russians should be doing that, but not us because we were the enemy. And so it did have that element

55
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,640
to it. So we didn't get much support, of course, from the United States government or the French

56
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,000
government for that matter, but we beat it. We beat them. And, and again, this was at the height of

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,840
the Cold War and the height of the nuclear arms race. And that was the pinnacle of it too. It,

58
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,880
it eased off after that because partly because of the atmosphere we had created and getting people

59
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,040
aware of the how dangerous the situation was that the, and what a nuclear war really would do

60
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:38,880
to our world. And we're sort of in a space like that now in a little bit. It's as close as it's

61
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,600
been to that kind of atmosphere since then, I would say. But on the other hand, I think people

62
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,760
have thought enough about how much ruin there would be not to the other side, but to your side too,

63
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,320
if ever such a thing happened. So I'm a bit optimistic on that front, but not very optimistic

64
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:07,360
on the energy front. And so we, we then went on just in and many of our followers thought what

65
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,560
kind of crazy goose are you going to be saving whales after, after you, after you stopped nuclear

66
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,440
war, you're now going to save the whales. What's that got to do with anything? And, and so we lost

67
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,440
a few followers, but we set out into the Pacific for four years in a row every summer when the

68
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,960
Russians were killing and the Japanese were killing 30,000 large whales every year still

69
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:42,160
in the 1970s, mainly for their oil and for pet food. And the oil of the sperm whale is a special

70
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:49,040
type of oil. It's used in fine machinery, but it's also possible to grow a bean, which has

71
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,920
it just as good a oil in it. And then you don't have to slaughter a whale. And so we stopped that

72
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,240
by, by 1981, whaling was banned in the entire world because of what we did. We got out and

73
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,120
got in front of the harpoons and the pictures of us in a little boat in front of the harpoon with

74
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,840
the whale being killed went around, went around the world. And that's what really made us famous.

75
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,240
We weren't that famous when we were doing the nuclear testing stuff. It was, you know,

76
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,000
if they got in the newspapers, but when we did the Save the Whales campaign, we just got everybody

77
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,880
excited and interested in being able to do such a thing as to stop that. And because it was the

78
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:36,640
Japanese and the Russians, it was sort of balanced in terms of East and West. And we didn't have that

79
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,760
same attitude of thinking that we're a bunch of communists because we were actually going against

80
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:51,760
the communists. And that's what made us catch on fire and pretty soon millions of dollars

81
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,320
were involved and people were just throwing money at us and we started doing some really

82
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:04,480
good stuff. We stopped the capture of work of whales. I was the leader of that campaign

83
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,680
on Vancouver Island where the last attempt to capture an orca whale was thwarted by us.

84
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,400
And that was the end of that. They'd already taken nearly a third of the population

85
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,800
of the west coast of North America. They did after that start taking some whales from Iceland,

86
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,920
but that too has ended, I believe. And I don't think anybody is catching work of whales anymore.

87
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,800
We got to that point and we were famous around the world. But then we turned to a very serious

88
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,400
problem, which was the damaging of the rivers and lakes, particularly with toxic waste from

89
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,960
factories, especially in Europe. North America had adopted some pretty good

90
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:58,480
air and water pollution control laws in 1972 under Nixon. Again, it's funny and I mean,

91
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:07,200
Nixon is remembered for the Watergate break-in, but he actually stopped nuclear testing and stopped

92
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,560
killing whales and stopped toxic waste. He was behind all of those things.

93
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,080
The rivers of Europe, though, like the Elbe and the Rhine and the Thames, they were all poisoned.

94
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,440
There was almost no life in them because factories were putting their waste into the river under

95
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,680
water where no one could see it in a pipe. And we took a smaller boat than the ones we'd used on

96
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,200
the high seas. They were like 150-foot boats. We took more like a 75-foot boat that could go up the

97
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,800
rivers and we put scuba divers in the water to block the pipes where the waste was coming out

98
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:58,000
and it backed up into the factory and that image and that fact intrigued the media. And we got a

99
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,160
lot of press for plugging the pipes of these industries and today there's fish in all those

100
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:13,120
rivers. And so, you know, it was really a shame when Greenpeace went bad largely because it was

101
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,440
hijacked by the political left because they saw the money and the political power that we'd created.

102
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,360
We weren't political particularly. I've never been political. I've avoided it like the plague because

103
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,200
I believe that we should just judge every situation on its merit and not just say,

104
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,080
I'm a Republican so I support this, that and the other thing. Or I'm a Democrat and I support

105
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,600
this, that or the other thing. It doesn't make sense to me. I understand that it's legitimate

106
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:49,360
to have political parties. I just don't want to be in one. And I'd rather be a free agent,

107
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,080
so to say, to make up my own mind and to study things. I always say when I see a situation or

108
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,520
a problem, I don't just look at it from here. I walk all the way around it and look at it from

109
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:09,680
every direction I can imagine to try to understand it better. And now we've got a situation where

110
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,960
politics and science are being confused with each other. People are saying that there's a consensus

111
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:25,360
that humans are causing a global catastrophe, a global extreme weather and all this stuff, that

112
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,200
it's caused. So there's a consensus, is there? Well, that's not how science works. I mean,

113
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,120
if you look at any invention or discovery that's been done, that's why there's a Nobel Prize to

114
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,520
give to individuals who have exceptionally discovered something. Things aren't discovered by

115
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:52,800
committees. Rules are made by committees after the discovery has been made. But to separate

116
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,280
science from politics is absolutely essential and it's there being confused,

117
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:05,440
totally in the Western world. I think that, you know, I don't want to live in Russia or China

118
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,440
particularly, although Moscow is such a beautiful city. I don't want to live there particularly

119
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,520
because of their political structure. But I think they do a better job in some ways of discerning

120
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:24,160
the difference between knowledge and politics and because politics is really just about policy.

121
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,880
But if you make policy based on bad science, you get bad policy. You can even get bad policy

122
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:39,040
based on good science if you're not smart. But the truth of the matter is that there is no

123
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,080
hard evidence that carbon dioxide is causing anything to happen to the temperature of the

124
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:51,680
earth. There's none. It is totally theoretical. But the reason I called my book Fake Invisible

125
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:59,920
Catastrophes and Threats of Doom is because they are focusing on things that nobody can see

126
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:11,120
and making up stories about. It's impossible because you can't see it. The first rule of

127
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,760
science is observation. You have to observe something. It doesn't have to be with your eyes.

128
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,760
It can be with a microscope or with a microphone or it can be with any tool you can imagine.

129
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,640
Radiation is the other one besides carbon dioxide. Those are the two main ones that are in the

130
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:36,880
invisible category. So they blame everything on carbon dioxide practically. And then the other

131
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:43,280
category is remote. And that's why polar bears and coral reefs are the icons. Because again,

132
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:50,320
hardly anybody can see them or go there. Who goes to the North Pole and counts all the polar bears?

133
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,760
When in fact, and why is it that the media never mentions the treaty that was signed in 1973?

134
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Like it wasn't in a thousand years ago. It was in 1973. The treaty was signed

135
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:13,440
among all the polar nations, which are six, to end the unrestricted hunting of polar bears in 1973.

136
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,360
Because wildlife biologists went to the governments and said they're killing. It's too

137
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,560
easy for rich people to go up there in a plane and hire a guide and get a polar bear or two.

138
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,120
And there was no restriction. They could take as many as they wanted.

139
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,240
So that was ended and and in force and has been ever since. And that's why the polar bear

140
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,160
population has grown three to five times larger than it was then. Which now I don't even believe

141
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,200
because all we see is photographs of lone polar bears on sheets of ice that are about to

142
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:55,120
to melt. Yes, their common name is sea bears as in SEA bears. They when they jump off an iceberg

143
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,120
and start swimming, they know where they're going. It's not as if they're going to swim out to see

144
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:09,840
and drown. More people drown every year than polar bears do. And it is ridiculous to suggest

145
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:16,000
that a polar bear doesn't know how to figure out things. You see, we know that polar bears can

146
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,360
survive through much warmer periods than what we're in now. Because the three interglacial periods

147
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,480
that came before this one, which is known as the Holocene, it's about 10,000 years into it now.

148
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,720
And so it's about time for it to end like in the next hundreds of years somewhere. We're in an ice

149
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:42,160
age, but the glacial the glacial maximums of which there have been 40 or more have all occurred

150
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,640
within the last 2.6 million years in the Pleistocene Ice Age. We are now in an interglacial period,

151
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,240
but it's still colder than it was for the 250 million years prior to that. Everything is upside

152
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,880
down, Nadia. Everything's upside down. They're saying there's too much CO2 when there's never

153
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,760
been so little. They're saying it's too hot when it's actually colder than it's been almost a whole

154
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,640
time of the earth right now, because that's why all that ice is on the poles. There's a lot, you

155
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,160
know, and they show a picture of the ice in the summer after six months of sunshine 24 hours a day.

156
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,840
But in the winter, every square inch of the Arctic Ocean plus ocean down even further south

157
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,120
than that is frozen solid. They never show you that one. It's still that way every winter.

158
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,800
And they've got people thinking that the ice is disappearing in the Arctic

159
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,720
and the Antarctic, which it's not. One of the most dire some doom and gloom predictions made by

160
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:48,400
climate alarmists is that we are in the midst of a abrupt climate change. And it's going to be

161
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,080
methane from the Arctic, which will lead to human extinction. Some scientists such as

162
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:01,200
Professor Guy McPherson believes it'll be by 2026. And you've recently said that

163
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,560
there's so far from the truth. How is it possible that there are two

164
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,640
sad conflicting theories? Is there not sufficient data and evidence that can be used to refute

165
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:21,280
disastrous claims like that of Professor McPherson? Yes, there are. It's not difficult. It's not

166
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,960
difficult to explain the history of the temperature and the CO2 on the earth, that people only go

167
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:37,760
back to 1850 when industrialization began. And they say it's like as if they think the

168
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:45,680
earth began then. It actually began 4.6 billion years ago. And when modern life emerged, which was

169
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:52,080
about half a billion years ago, before that it had all been the little tiny unicellular plankton in

170
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:59,840
the sea. But sexual reproduction occurred about 2.5 billion years ago. The photosynthesis occurred

171
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,360
even earlier than that. So life developed a lot of what we would consider to be very miraculous

172
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:14,000
processes early on. But when multicellular life emerged, that was the what called the

173
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:22,640
Cambrian explosion about 540 million years ago. Larger life forms came into being with

174
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,680
organs and flippers, but they didn't have any shells or backbones. They were all just like

175
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:37,680
jellyfish at first. And then gradually, gradually many of these multicellular organisms learned

176
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,800
to combine calcium with carbon dioxide in the ocean and make shells for themselves.

177
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,080
If you start thinking about all the marine creatures, a huge percentage of them,

178
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,040
including the corals, which is about 50% of all the calcium carbonate that is produced

179
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:01,840
by marine life. All of the limestone in the earth's crust was made by life. And the marble

180
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,360
and the chalk, the white cliffs of Dover are made of the skeletons of coccolithophores,

181
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:16,480
which are unicellular plant that makes a shell for itself. And you can imagine how important that

182
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:24,960
would be. Instead of just being a naked blob of jelly, you now have a thick hard shell to

183
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:33,280
surround yourself. And it's like a knight in armor. And so that was a huge advance in the

184
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:40,960
evolution of life. Like there's the crabs and snails and barnacles and clams and oysters. And

185
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:50,400
it goes on and on and on. And the coral reefs. And so that was a huge benefit. But unfortunately,

186
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,720
inadvertently, it meant that the CO2 in the ocean and the atmosphere, because they are connected

187
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,600
at the surface of the ocean, the ocean and the atmosphere are in equilibrium with regard to

188
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,120
their CO2 content, the ocean containing about 50 times as much CO2 as the atmosphere.

189
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,280
So when these shells started pulling carbon dioxide out of the ocean to make their shells,

190
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,880
it started going down from about 5,000 parts per million at the time that that shell

191
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:30,400
process was invented to 180 parts from 6,000, 5,000 to 6,000 to 180 at the peak of the most recent

192
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:38,000
glacial advance. And then this went 20,000 years ago. It went down to went down to 180 parts per

193
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,520
million, which is only 50 parts per million above the death of plants. Because plants don't just

194
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:52,480
need CO2 to live, they need a certain concentration of it. And 180 parts per million is only 0.018%.

195
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,840
And we all currently, according to most sources, we are 0.04.

196
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:09,360
Yeah, 0.425 or so. Yes, we have increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 50%.

197
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,040
And this is one of the best things that has happened in the history of life.

198
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,720
And humans did it inadvertently, just like the shellfish inadvertently caused the CO2 to decline

199
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:30,080
so drastically over half a billion years. We have come back and saved life from a certain demise.

200
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,120
No other species could do this, could find the fossil fuels.

201
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:42,320
It highlights our ability to adapt. And we are also evil for doing this.

202
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,560
And it's kind of like a death wish, I think. I don't know why these things come about, but there

203
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:54,240
was a time when people burned women as witches with absolutely no evidence whatsoever of which

204
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,320
we even was, right? And throwing virgins into volcanoes was fairly popular back in the day.

205
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:09,120
And all through history, there have been ogrums. And the Germans murdering 8 million

206
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:18,000
people of a certain genetic extraction. I mean, whoa, we can be evil. But the thing is,

207
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,440
this thing about the climate, it's the people who are calling us deniers who are actually the

208
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:32,080
evil ones, because when you call a person a denier, we're not denying that the climate changes.

209
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,760
So why don't they use straight language? You accuse us of what we are actually believing,

210
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,640
which is that CO2 is a net benefit to life on Earth. That's what we believe.

211
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:53,120
We're just about to be joined by one of the winners of the 2022 Nobel Prize for Physics,

212
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,440
in our CO2 coalition in Harlington, Virginia, which is right on the border of Washington, DC.

213
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,200
And I was a founding director along with Will Happer and Dick Linsen.

214
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,120
I interviewed Dr. Linsen last week and Professor Happer last year. And I actually

215
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,320
wanted to mention earlier, when you referred to it as a death wish, that Professor Happer said that

216
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:28,080
this drive towards net zero, it's a suicide pact. Correct. And Dr. Linsen said last week that

217
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,960
it's almost as if the environmentalists have decided to commit suicide.

218
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:41,520
If net zero were actually achieved, that is the end of net amounts of CO2 going into the atmosphere.

219
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,080
How close do you think we are to that?

220
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,840
It's never going to happen. The only way it could happen is if we adopted nuclear

221
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:57,200
energy on a large scale. And that could be done. In 100 years, we could basically get off of at

222
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:06,160
least 50 to 75% of the fossil fuels we're using today. Everything stationary can be provided

223
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:13,440
by nuclear energy, heat and electricity. My concern here is where will we get our CO2 from?

224
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:24,960
We get our CO2 from the atmosphere in the ocean. And at this point in history of the earth,

225
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,880
it has been declining steadily for at least half a billion years. Up and down, just like the

226
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,280
temperature goes up and down, but generally we are now, we're in the place to see an ice age.

227
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,120
This is one of 40 or more interglacial periods where it gets a little bit warmer

228
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,000
than it is during the glacial advances. Canada was covered in over a mile of ice from one side to

229
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,040
the other during the most recent glaciation. And so was it during all the previous ones,

230
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:01,280
of which there were 40. And in between, you get a situation where it's halfway as livable.

231
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,160
Canada, that is, because less than half of it is lived in. It's working on 90% of Canadians

232
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,920
are within 100 miles of the US border for a good reason. The further north you go, the more inhospitable

233
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:19,920
it becomes. People forget that humans are a tropical species. We are not an arctic species.

234
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,960
We're not polar bears or penguins. We evolved at the equator, and if it weren't for fire,

235
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,800
clothing, and shelter, we couldn't have moved out of Africa. It's the only reason we were able to do so.

236
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,200
So, and those are all three very important things in our lives, fire, shelter, and clothing,

237
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,680
especially if you live in a cold place. You know, I'm in Baja, California,

238
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,320
which is part of Mexico right now, and it's a beautiful warm day, but it gets cold enough here

239
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:56,560
in the winter down into the teens and tens that if people came here and didn't have fire,

240
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:02,240
shelter, and clothing, they would die out very quickly. Even here, and I'm at the Tropic of

241
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,560
Cancer, humans could not live at the Tropic of Cancer without fire, shelter, and clothing.

242
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,600
And even at the equator, there's nights that are cold enough that you want to have a big

243
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,120
animal skin on you while you're sleeping. You know, you could call that clothing.

244
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,800
But I'd like to talk about coral reefs for a bit, because there is this myth that they're going to

245
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,960
die if it gets too hot. Funnily enough, though, the most biodiverse coral reefs in the world are in

246
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,200
the warmest ocean of the world, which is the Indonesian archipelago, and that's where there's

247
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,280
over 600 species of coral and over 2,000 species of reef-ish. By far the most biodiverse in the world,

248
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,560
the Caribbean is the next most diverse, and it happens to be the second warmest ocean in the

249
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:55,840
world. So the truth is, if the world warms, the corals will expand to a much larger range than

250
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,640
they occupy today. That's the truth. And even the people who study coral try to avoid saying

251
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,480
that, because if you say that, it means you don't believe that global warming is going to destroy

252
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,800
the coral, right? And if you don't believe that global warming is going to destroy the coral,

253
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,000
then you're not on our side. And then you won't get any more money from the politicians through

254
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,240
the bureaucrats into the universities. That's where the quiet side of this whole thing is.

255
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,400
Everybody hears the commotion from the media, and from the greens, and from the world economic

256
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:32,320
forum and all these people. But where the real business is taking place is where politicians

257
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,000
are instructing their bureaucrats to give scientists in the universities where 80% of all

258
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,120
the research in the United States is done, is in universities. And if you're a professor in a

259
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,280
university, you don't go along with the climate thing, you're not getting any money, period.

260
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,880
And with few exceptions, very few exceptions. And so, and this is the consensus is being paid for,

261
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,000
right? And bought, bought and paid for. And that's what's going on. And so then all the noise comes

262
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,840
from the scientists, from the media, from the greens, and they're all includes together making

263
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,400
a whole pile of money out of this. And it is, there have always been doomsday scenarios.

264
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,480
And yet, for some reason, doom has never occurred. I mean, like the end of the earth,

265
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,200
you know, it's just never seems to come about, no matter how often you predict it.

266
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:35,520
You just feel like going, wake up, people, wake up. Nothing like a good disaster to make the news.

267
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,120
It's human nature's latest thing. Everything is fine today. So we'd have nothing to say.

268
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:50,800
That is one of the arguments that's the very devoted to the narrative in terms of climate change.

269
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:58,320
People argue it when it comes to scientists that disagree with the consensus, that they're not

270
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,600
going to be around for long enough to have, you know, their predictions and advice end up killing

271
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,040
people. It's not going to upset them. Well, most of the people who like myself are willing to tell

272
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:18,240
the truth about this are not in the, in the clutches of some economic necessity. If you're

273
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:29,760
working for a living and you defy the narrative of consensus about climate disaster, you're,

274
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:36,560
you're, you know, you're going to be shunned. And, and I am shunned by these people and they call

275
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:43,360
me names. That's all they can seem to come up with is calling me names. And, and I don't see

276
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,080
what that has to do with science myself. I've never worked for the fossil fuel industry in my

277
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,800
life. But everyone, what else did you do? Yeah, I don't know why. I mean, I hadn't,

278
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:58,160
there's no record of it. I haven't hidden anything in my, I've been a very open person all my life.

279
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:04,800
I've never told a lie. And, and that is, that is, that is the truth. I don't tell lies.

280
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,440
Some people do. I think, and some people, I think they know they're lying. I'm not sure.

281
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:19,040
You can't, you can't see inside a person's brain. But the truth of the matter is, is there is no

282
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,000
evidence of a climate catastrophe. All they're talking about now is extreme weather events,

283
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,320
which have been going on since the beginning of time. And forest fires, for goodness sakes,

284
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:36,960
most forest fires are caused by people carelessly failing to put out campfires and throwing

285
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,040
cigarette butts out the window and that sort of thing is a lot of them. But lightning has been

286
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:48,400
here forever, right? And lightning is, causes forest fires. But the reasons that these fires

287
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:54,160
are so severe today is due to mismanagement. If you, if you imagine back in the day when I was

288
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:01,760
talking about when all, all the energy was from wood, every end of every summer, the people went

289
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,640
out from cities and towns and gathered all the dead wood in the forest. That's the first day

290
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:13,280
would take because it's the easiest to take and it's already dry. So this really reduces the,

291
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,720
the chance of a catastrophic wildfire going up into the crown of the trees and starting the whole

292
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:26,240
place ablaze. That is, if you look at the United States, they, in the West, a huge amount of land

293
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,720
is owned by the federal government, national parks, national forests, Bureau of Land Management land.

294
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,600
So it's controlled from Washington where most of the politicians are from the east of the Mississippi.

295
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,760
Most of the federal lands are west of the Mississippi. Idaho is 70% federally owned.

296
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,880
So they don't have, they don't care really about what happens there. And so the, the, the forests

297
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:58,080
in the east of the country down along the, the southern states, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana,

298
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,360
they're covered in forest. They almost never have forest fires because they're managed properly.

299
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:09,680
Because the people who own them want to get the wood, not to have a charred forest left behind.

300
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,720
The people who are, who are owning the federal lands in the western United States don't really care

301
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,320
that much. And then they can use that as a way of saying, look what the climate has done to our

302
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,400
environment. It's causing these forest fires. No, you are causing the forest fires because you

303
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,720
won't let people manage them properly. What got temperate to changes? IPCC reports. Dr. Linsen said

304
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,120
that there's really actually just one working group that deals with science. And now they did not

305
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,000
actually come up with anything that posed an existential threat. Scientists will look at the

306
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,240
data. They won't come up with doomsday predictions, but they'll leave it open-ended and leave the

307
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,960
politicians do what they will. Now the IPCC's reports don't say that there's doomsday coming.

308
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,320
They don't say that. They say the temperature has risen one degree in the last 250 years.

309
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,480
Which is true. We're in a warming period. It's a slight warming period. We've been in cooling

310
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,840
periods and warming periods all through the Holocene. The Holocene was warmer than it is now,

311
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:16,560
8,000 years ago, until about 6,000 years ago. It was warmer than it is now, even though it's

312
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,240
getting warmer now than it was 200 years ago. It goes up and down. But sometimes it goes up and

313
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:29,280
down downwards. And sometimes it goes up and down upwards. Just a fact. It wobbles. There's cycles

314
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,120
on cycles on cycles. And there's El Niño and La Niña. And all of these short cycles. And then

315
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,600
there's longer cycles and longer still cycles. And then there's things we just don't even understand

316
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:46,320
at all. Like why the earth went into another ice age 2.6 million years ago. When there was no ice

317
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,000
on the earth at all for the 250 million years before that. When the Keru Ice Age ended, which

318
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,120
had lasted 100 million years during the Carboniferous period. Extreme weather is one thing. But damage

319
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:06,080
caused to people is another. The number of people being killed by extreme weather has gone down by

320
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:13,760
98% in the last 200 years. It's actually just in the last, it's actually just in the last 100 years

321
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:21,280
since the 1920s. It's been proven that this is the case. And most people who died from weather in

322
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:30,480
those days was by starvation. Because what the weather did to their crops. It's unbelievable

323
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,360
how much less danger there is for people today than there was just 100 years ago. Much less

324
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,880
danger. And a lot of it is because of fossil fuels and nitrogen fertilizer.

325
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:51,440
People, I mean it's only 100 years they have to look out there. And to see that there's definite

326
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,920
proof that on a per capita basis there's been a 98% reduction in death from extreme weather.

327
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:05,120
And that includes all extreme weather of every kind. It's just been published. And it is not

328
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,760
being carried by the mainstream media. I mean they should have this as their top story.

329
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,840
In 2010 this is 40 years after you co-founded Greenpeace. The organization comes out with a

330
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:21,920
statement saying that you were in fact not a founding member. What is it that you observed

331
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,240
in the organization that led to you walking away? I mean it must have been a really difficult

332
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,240
decision to walk away from something that you were that sincerely passionate about.

333
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,160
It was an easy decision to make because I had no choice. I had no choice for two reasons.

334
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:45,040
First, much of the environment, we started out with a fairly strong humanitarian orientation to

335
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,360
save civilization from nuclear war. That must mean you care about people at least a little bit.

336
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,200
And it came to the point where the environmental movement including Greenpeace was basically

337
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,400
characterizing humans as the enemies of nature. We are the enemies of the earth. It was sort of like

338
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:07,200
human beings are the only evil species on the planet. And even cockroaches are better than we

339
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,760
type thing. So this is the philosophical level, high philosophical level of this judgmental idea

340
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,560
that human beings are the enemies of nature. And then came a campaign proposal from people who

341
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,600
had no science education. I was the only one who had a formal science education on the international

342
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:31,120
board of Greenpeace for the whole of those 15 years. My fellow directors, none of whom had any

343
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:39,360
formal science education, decided that Greenpeace should start a campaign to ban chlorine worldwide.

344
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:48,720
That was the slogan. And I said to them, you guys, you gotta be a little more nuanced than that because

345
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:55,280
chlorine happens to be one of the most important elements for human life that there is. Table salt

346
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,600
for example, is sodium chloride. And it is an essential nutrient. Chlorine, yes, we're talking

347
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:11,040
about chlorine, which is one of the halogens, which includes fluorine, bromine, chlorine, iodine,

348
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,640
and arginine, I think it's called or something like that. This group of chemicals is one of the

349
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:23,600
most reactive group of chemicals in the whole periodic table. It's aggressive. And of course,

350
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:30,320
we know that elemental chlorine gas can kill you really quickly because it combines with everything,

351
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:38,000
just right like that. The reason there's no chlorine gas around is because it's combined

352
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,600
with something else like sodium. It doesn't. It can't exist freely in the atmosphere. It has to

353
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,920
get attached to something. And it gets attached to lots of things, some of which are the most

354
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,520
important things in medicine. 85% of all our pharmaceuticals are made with chlorine chemistry,

355
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,640
and 25% of our medicines actually have chlorine in them. And table salt, sodium chloride,

356
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:12,160
which is an essential nutrient for all life, that's why Gandhi marched to the sea to make salt

357
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:18,800
was because the British were taxing the poor people in India for something that was essential.

358
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,520
And so it was one of his greatest achievements was this making salt by the sea.

359
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:32,560
And then in addition to that, adding chlorine to drinking water was the biggest advance in the

360
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,640
history of public health and to swimming pools and spas. You don't have a hot tub without chlorine

361
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,360
or bromine pucks floating around in the thing. You don't do that because you don't want to spread

362
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,080
disease. And so I'm going, you guys, you're still going to do this? Have a campaign to van

363
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:56,320
chlorine worldwide? Yep, we're going ahead. Once we came to the issue of toxicity and chemicals,

364
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,120
you have to have some science. You don't need any science to want to stop nuclear war. You don't

365
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:05,520
need any science to save 30,000 whales from being killed every year. You don't have to be a whale

366
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:12,160
scientist for that. But if you're going to deal with chemistry, you have to have some science,

367
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:19,600
because the first rule of chemistry, in many ways, is the toxicity is in the dose.

368
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:26,240
So table salt is essential at a small dose. Then you can take too much of it,

369
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,920
but it still doesn't hurt you. You don't need that much of it, but it doesn't hurt you.

370
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Then it starts to hurt you. If you took a cup of salt and put it in your stomach, you're dead.

371
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,600
Also in the final analysis, Greenpeace was hijacked by the political left,

372
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,600
because they were smarter at politics than we were, because we weren't really politicians.

373
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:53,680
We were campaigners. And we knew how to do that. We knew how to get people's attention.

374
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,600
We knew what the real issues were. And all of a sudden, these guys are saying that chlorine

375
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:06,720
should be banned. And it was just a fundraising program based on incorrect information. So how

376
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,800
could I be involved in that? So there was no choice. I had to go. I always say I blame

377
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:19,120
McTaggart. David McTaggart became our chairman. He was kind of a very, very interesting person.

378
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:28,320
He was friends with the Agat Khan and with the head of the science division in Moscow for Russia.

379
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,640
All kind of high-level people, the person who founded CNN.

380
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:45,280
He was a real mover in society, but he had no science. And he really believed that everybody

381
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,960
was going to be poisoned by chemicals, the modern civilization, and all the plastics.

382
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,560
You know how people say that they act as though plastic is toxic?

383
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,160
Right? Well, is that why we wrap our food in it? Go on the internet and look for

384
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:12,480
plastic in the stomachs of albatross chicks. And you'll see these made-up pictures of a dead

385
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:19,920
albatross chick slaced open, full of plastic. Right? This does not happen in the world.

386
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:28,560
It is true. It is true that the parents of albatross chicks in the nest bring bits of hard

387
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:36,000
plastic and other such materials and give it to the chick for its gizzard to grind its food.

388
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:43,440
Birds don't have teeth, so plastic is actually performing a useful function for seabirds.

389
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,040
They have two stomachs. One has hard objects in it that when the chicks are in this nest,

390
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,840
they can't go out and get it for themselves. But then for the rest of their lives, all birds

391
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,200
ingest hard objects of a certain size and shape to put in their gizzards to grind their food,

392
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:08,080
because they have no teeth. They can't chew their food. So if a mother bird gives its chick

393
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:14,960
a squid eight inches long, you know, like that, it goes to the gizzard where it gets ground up,

394
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,320
except for the beak of the squid, which is retained as a hard object to continue helping

395
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:26,000
digest the food. And this is all well understood for 60 years. It's all been understood. Scientists

396
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,560
at first, when they saw that birds were using plastic as one of the objects that they gave their

397
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,920
chicks to digest their food, were worried about it. But they came to realize that it causes no

398
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,360
harm. As a matter of fact, it works just as well as pumice stones and pieces of wood and

399
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:48,560
bit nuts that fall off trees into the sea. It's hard to find those hard objects in the sea. There's

400
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,480
no pebbles in the sea, whereas on land birds just use pebbles about the size of a marble

401
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,680
and smaller. So this is all just total fake. And the other thing that plastic does in the sea is

402
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,080
it acts as a substrate, just like driftwood does for marine life to grow on. And then for other

403
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,040
species to eat the marine life that's growing on the piece of plastic. It's like a little floating

404
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,400
reef. Did you know that there is no such thing as the Pacific Garbage Patch, which I'm sure you've

405
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,680
heard of? There isn't such a thing, because it's invisible. It's in the middle of the Pacific Ocean

406
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,000
where Noah can look out the window and see whether it really exists. So they made it up and made

407
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,360
paintings of it. You go on the internet and look for Great Pacific Garbage Patch. You'll find all

408
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:39,040
these made up cartoon-like things which show this is the Pacific Garbage Patch and they take a brush

409
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:47,040
and paint a big blob on a map of the earth that they made up. And the only thing that is a real

410
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,720
picture that claims to be part of the Pacific Garbage Patch right underneath it says this is

411
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,280
part of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. I looked at it and it's a big sea of debris in the ocean,

412
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,720
huge sea of debris. And I looked and in the background there were mountains. And I'm going,

413
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,120
there's no mountains in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It turns out this was the debris that was

414
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:13,280
washed off of Japan during the tsunami that killed 20,000 people. And it was all the towns,

415
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,840
the towns all just destroyed. And that's why there were mountains in the background,

416
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,640
because that was Japan. And they pretended that it was the Pacific Garbage Patch. It's on the

417
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:28,800
internet. Just go on the internet and say Pacific Garbage Patch, twice the size of Texas, they say,

418
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,920
and growing and growing faster than we ever imagined. And it's not true. The most of the

419
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,280
plastic in the sea is discarded fishing gear. And that is an issue that should be addressed.

420
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:45,600
But the problem is, is fishermen want their boats to be used for putting fish in and nets in that

421
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:51,440
work, not discarded, not nets they want to get rid of if they're damaged, which happens a lot with

422
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,720
nets. So they just throw them overboard. So maybe somebody should get together with the fishing

423
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:03,280
industry and see if they can't help them figure out a way, maybe to hang them off the bow,

424
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,440
so that they're not taking up room in the boat. Because the boat, they want the boat for ice and

425
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:14,800
fish. Because boats have a limited amount of room in them, fishing boats. So that's why they throw

426
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,360
it away. But it isn't as though people are out there shoveling plastic into the ocean.

427
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:27,840
You know, it's true that plastic gets into rivers. And especially in Southeast Asia,

428
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:34,400
it was really quite awful to see. All of the people who are selling vegetables and stuff are

429
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:40,080
often on the bank of a river. And they just throw everything that they don't want away,

430
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,840
rotten food and plastic wrappers. And the whole thing goes into the river.

431
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:51,360
I see that you also wonder what the possible end goal could be. Do you think that the

432
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:57,600
motivation is purely a profit? Because only very few people are benefiting from this.

433
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:05,440
Do you think it's control? I'd say it's more control than money. Yes, I do. I believe it's a

434
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:15,920
basically it's a communist kind of approach to the situation. And I'm not joining, I'm afraid.

435
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:28,640
That's just how I see it. I think many people are innocent, innocently being pulled into this fear.

436
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:36,080
But many people are doing it on purpose and exaggerating it to such an extent.

437
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,680
The earth is actually doing quite fine right now. The human species can be immensely proud of

438
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:50,240
itself in retrospect, not because we did it on purpose, but because we have reversed the decline

439
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,280
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which no other species could have done. And this is a good

440
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:02,720
thing, the replenishment. Every molecule of CO2 we emit came from the environment in the first

441
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:09,920
place and was turned into fossil fuels or turned into limestone, which we used to make cement.

442
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,520
And that reduces 10% of our CO2 emissions. The other 90% is almost all fossil fuels.

443
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,640
And all of that CO2 that we are emitting from the fossil fuels came from the atmosphere in

444
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:28,800
the first place. We are just putting it back where it came from. And when it was there, life flourished.

445
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:38,560
So that's all you need to know. You really don't need to know anything more than that.
