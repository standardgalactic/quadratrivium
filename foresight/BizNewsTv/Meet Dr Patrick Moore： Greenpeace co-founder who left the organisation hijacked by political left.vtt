00:00.000 --> 00:09.280
I'm Nanja Swart of 4Basees.com. Dr. Patrick Moe joins us, co-founder and former leader of Greenpeace and leader in the international environmental field.

00:09.280 --> 00:13.440
For over four decades, Dr. Moe, it's really, really a pleasure to have you with us.

00:14.160 --> 00:17.600
Thanks for having me on, Nadja. There's lots to talk about these days.

00:17.600 --> 00:25.600
Let's start with the story of how you co-founded Greenpeace, you know, what inspired you and also,

00:25.680 --> 00:31.760
at the time, what was the state of the environment and the public's perception thereof?

00:32.960 --> 00:40.000
Well, as a child, I don't think the word environment was ever spoken, and certainly ecology was never

00:40.000 --> 00:45.600
mentioned. Even when we started Greenpeace, the word ecology was not being used in the popular

00:45.600 --> 00:53.920
press, but environment was by that time, of course. I grew up in absolute wilderness on a floating village

00:54.560 --> 01:00.480
in a small bay on northern Vancouver Island with nothing but water and forest around.

01:01.440 --> 01:08.960
And no road came to that village. Everything came by boat from, and the boats had to navigate open

01:08.960 --> 01:15.360
ocean on the west coast of Vancouver Island in the Pacific to get into our harbor. So it was,

01:15.360 --> 01:22.000
it was a completely unique childhood that I had there, and, but the school only went to grade

01:22.080 --> 01:28.320
eight. I went to school by boat every day because our floating village was about two miles from the

01:28.320 --> 01:33.040
fishing village, which was on the land. And there was a small one-room school house with

01:33.680 --> 01:39.200
somewhere between eight and 12 children in the average year in all, all eight grades.

01:40.400 --> 01:45.600
And I saw I went grade one to eight there, and then was sent to boarding school in Vancouver

01:45.600 --> 01:51.200
to a sort of English style boarding school, what they call public schools in England.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.760
And I boarded there, and my parents would come a couple times a year to see me. And then I'd go

01:57.760 --> 02:02.480
home in the summer back to Winter Harbor and work in the logging camp that my father owned.

02:03.440 --> 02:10.720
So that's how I, my childhood, but I didn't realize that I had been in nature

02:12.640 --> 02:17.600
naturally. It wasn't like something special. It was where I lived. And when I

02:18.400 --> 02:25.600
became sort of acidified, I realized how lucky I had been. And, and, and, and went into life

02:25.600 --> 02:31.280
science just naturally that because I was interested in birds and animals and the ocean and shells,

02:31.280 --> 02:37.920
shellfish and fish, and I fished all my life. And so I,

02:40.640 --> 02:46.240
I, I did a PhD in ecology eventually after doing a Bachelor of Science in Forestry and

02:46.240 --> 02:53.280
Biology. And so I had, I was pretty thick into life science already by the time I was 20.

02:54.160 --> 02:59.440
And then I, while I was doing my PhD, I heard about this little group that was starting to meet

02:59.440 --> 03:04.640
in the basement of the Unitarian Church in Vancouver, which is a church that accepts

03:04.640 --> 03:12.560
people from all religions. And, and even if you don't have a religion like me, it accepted you.

03:13.280 --> 03:20.640
So I joined this group as a fledgling group of people. We all were pretty much hippies

03:20.640 --> 03:25.920
by the looks of us, but everybody actually was a pretty professional oriented person. There were

03:25.920 --> 03:33.680
writers and doctors and lawyers and ecologists and etc. And I guess I was the leading life

03:33.680 --> 03:39.600
scientist in, in that early group, because we had, it wasn't about life science. It was about

03:39.600 --> 03:47.520
stopping nuclear testing at the beginning. And so we sailed a boat across the North Pacific Ocean

03:47.520 --> 03:55.920
in September 71 to protest against the five megaton hydrogen bomb the United States was going

03:55.920 --> 04:02.400
to detonate. And we managed to get arrested by the Coast Guard and get on Walter Cronkite's evening

04:02.400 --> 04:07.440
news nationally in the United States. And pretty soon tens of thousands of people were marching

04:08.240 --> 04:13.360
against the bomb. And the day that bomb was detonated, people came from both sides of the

04:13.360 --> 04:18.960
border to join hands and shut the border down for a day between all across Canada. I mean,

04:18.960 --> 04:26.240
that's 4,000 miles or whatever. And every border crossing was shut down. And it was a really big

04:26.240 --> 04:32.320
demonstration. And it's a long time ago now. So hardly anybody remembers it because they weren't

04:32.320 --> 04:40.400
born yet, but many, many people. And that began Greenpeace. And then we went, we won. President

04:40.400 --> 04:46.800
Nixon canceled the, the, the future tests of nuclear weapons in Alaska. That was the last time

04:46.800 --> 04:52.560
the United States detonated a hydrogen bomb. It was very significant. And also the, the,

04:52.560 --> 04:59.520
the beginning of the environmental movement was happening right there. And so then we went against

04:59.520 --> 05:04.640
French atmospheric nuclear testing in the South Pacific. The French public didn't even know that

05:04.640 --> 05:10.000
their government was still testing nuclear weapons down there. It was never printed in because the

05:10.000 --> 05:17.760
government owned all the press that controlled it. And so we went to Paris and, and demonstrated in

05:17.760 --> 05:25.120
Notre Dame Cathedral while our boat was on its way to Murroir Atole in French, in French Polynesia

05:25.120 --> 05:30.240
where they were detonating these bombs in the air and sending radiation around the whole world.

05:30.240 --> 05:36.560
It took two years, but we stopped it. And so, but a lot of people thought we must be commies if

05:37.280 --> 05:41.920
we were trying to stop US and French nuclear testing and weren't going after the Russians.

05:42.560 --> 05:49.280
Well, going after the Russians, we'd come out in a coffin. So it didn't make any sense for us to

05:49.440 --> 05:58.000
Russians should be doing that, but not us because we were the enemy. And so it did have that element

05:58.000 --> 06:02.640
to it. So we didn't get much support, of course, from the United States government or the French

06:02.640 --> 06:08.000
government for that matter, but we beat it. We beat them. And, and again, this was at the height of

06:08.000 --> 06:13.840
the Cold War and the height of the nuclear arms race. And that was the pinnacle of it too. It,

06:14.400 --> 06:20.880
it eased off after that because partly because of the atmosphere we had created and getting people

06:20.880 --> 06:27.040
aware of the how dangerous the situation was that the, and what a nuclear war really would do

06:28.000 --> 06:38.880
to our world. And we're sort of in a space like that now in a little bit. It's as close as it's

06:38.880 --> 06:45.600
been to that kind of atmosphere since then, I would say. But on the other hand, I think people

06:45.600 --> 06:51.760
have thought enough about how much ruin there would be not to the other side, but to your side too,

06:52.560 --> 06:58.320
if ever such a thing happened. So I'm a bit optimistic on that front, but not very optimistic

06:58.320 --> 07:07.360
on the energy front. And so we, we then went on just in and many of our followers thought what

07:07.360 --> 07:14.560
kind of crazy goose are you going to be saving whales after, after you, after you stopped nuclear

07:14.560 --> 07:21.440
war, you're now going to save the whales. What's that got to do with anything? And, and so we lost

07:21.440 --> 07:27.440
a few followers, but we set out into the Pacific for four years in a row every summer when the

07:27.440 --> 07:32.960
Russians were killing and the Japanese were killing 30,000 large whales every year still

07:33.520 --> 07:42.160
in the 1970s, mainly for their oil and for pet food. And the oil of the sperm whale is a special

07:42.160 --> 07:49.040
type of oil. It's used in fine machinery, but it's also possible to grow a bean, which has

07:49.040 --> 07:55.920
it just as good a oil in it. And then you don't have to slaughter a whale. And so we stopped that

07:56.880 --> 08:02.240
by, by 1981, whaling was banned in the entire world because of what we did. We got out and

08:02.240 --> 08:07.120
got in front of the harpoons and the pictures of us in a little boat in front of the harpoon with

08:07.120 --> 08:11.840
the whale being killed went around, went around the world. And that's what really made us famous.

08:11.840 --> 08:16.240
We weren't that famous when we were doing the nuclear testing stuff. It was, you know,

08:16.240 --> 08:22.000
if they got in the newspapers, but when we did the Save the Whales campaign, we just got everybody

08:22.000 --> 08:28.880
excited and interested in being able to do such a thing as to stop that. And because it was the

08:28.880 --> 08:36.640
Japanese and the Russians, it was sort of balanced in terms of East and West. And we didn't have that

08:36.640 --> 08:43.760
same attitude of thinking that we're a bunch of communists because we were actually going against

08:43.760 --> 08:51.760
the communists. And that's what made us catch on fire and pretty soon millions of dollars

08:52.000 --> 08:56.320
were involved and people were just throwing money at us and we started doing some really

08:57.440 --> 09:04.480
good stuff. We stopped the capture of work of whales. I was the leader of that campaign

09:05.360 --> 09:11.680
on Vancouver Island where the last attempt to capture an orca whale was thwarted by us.

09:12.400 --> 09:16.400
And that was the end of that. They'd already taken nearly a third of the population

09:16.400 --> 09:22.800
of the west coast of North America. They did after that start taking some whales from Iceland,

09:22.800 --> 09:29.920
but that too has ended, I believe. And I don't think anybody is catching work of whales anymore.

09:29.920 --> 09:36.800
We got to that point and we were famous around the world. But then we turned to a very serious

09:36.800 --> 09:44.400
problem, which was the damaging of the rivers and lakes, particularly with toxic waste from

09:44.400 --> 09:48.960
factories, especially in Europe. North America had adopted some pretty good

09:50.160 --> 09:58.480
air and water pollution control laws in 1972 under Nixon. Again, it's funny and I mean,

09:59.600 --> 10:07.200
Nixon is remembered for the Watergate break-in, but he actually stopped nuclear testing and stopped

10:08.160 --> 10:14.560
killing whales and stopped toxic waste. He was behind all of those things.

10:17.600 --> 10:24.080
The rivers of Europe, though, like the Elbe and the Rhine and the Thames, they were all poisoned.

10:24.080 --> 10:29.440
There was almost no life in them because factories were putting their waste into the river under

10:29.440 --> 10:35.680
water where no one could see it in a pipe. And we took a smaller boat than the ones we'd used on

10:35.680 --> 10:41.200
the high seas. They were like 150-foot boats. We took more like a 75-foot boat that could go up the

10:41.200 --> 10:48.800
rivers and we put scuba divers in the water to block the pipes where the waste was coming out

10:48.800 --> 10:58.000
and it backed up into the factory and that image and that fact intrigued the media. And we got a

10:58.000 --> 11:04.160
lot of press for plugging the pipes of these industries and today there's fish in all those

11:04.160 --> 11:13.120
rivers. And so, you know, it was really a shame when Greenpeace went bad largely because it was

11:13.120 --> 11:19.440
hijacked by the political left because they saw the money and the political power that we'd created.

11:19.440 --> 11:25.360
We weren't political particularly. I've never been political. I've avoided it like the plague because

11:25.360 --> 11:31.200
I believe that we should just judge every situation on its merit and not just say,

11:31.200 --> 11:36.080
I'm a Republican so I support this, that and the other thing. Or I'm a Democrat and I support

11:36.080 --> 11:41.600
this, that or the other thing. It doesn't make sense to me. I understand that it's legitimate

11:41.600 --> 11:49.360
to have political parties. I just don't want to be in one. And I'd rather be a free agent,

11:50.240 --> 11:56.080
so to say, to make up my own mind and to study things. I always say when I see a situation or

11:56.080 --> 12:01.520
a problem, I don't just look at it from here. I walk all the way around it and look at it from

12:01.520 --> 12:09.680
every direction I can imagine to try to understand it better. And now we've got a situation where

12:09.680 --> 12:16.960
politics and science are being confused with each other. People are saying that there's a consensus

12:16.960 --> 12:25.360
that humans are causing a global catastrophe, a global extreme weather and all this stuff, that

12:25.360 --> 12:31.200
it's caused. So there's a consensus, is there? Well, that's not how science works. I mean,

12:31.200 --> 12:37.120
if you look at any invention or discovery that's been done, that's why there's a Nobel Prize to

12:38.240 --> 12:45.520
give to individuals who have exceptionally discovered something. Things aren't discovered by

12:45.520 --> 12:52.800
committees. Rules are made by committees after the discovery has been made. But to separate

12:52.800 --> 12:57.280
science from politics is absolutely essential and it's there being confused,

12:58.800 --> 13:05.440
totally in the Western world. I think that, you know, I don't want to live in Russia or China

13:05.440 --> 13:11.440
particularly, although Moscow is such a beautiful city. I don't want to live there particularly

13:11.440 --> 13:17.520
because of their political structure. But I think they do a better job in some ways of discerning

13:17.520 --> 13:24.160
the difference between knowledge and politics and because politics is really just about policy.

13:25.200 --> 13:30.880
But if you make policy based on bad science, you get bad policy. You can even get bad policy

13:30.880 --> 13:39.040
based on good science if you're not smart. But the truth of the matter is that there is no

13:39.040 --> 13:44.080
hard evidence that carbon dioxide is causing anything to happen to the temperature of the

13:44.080 --> 13:51.680
earth. There's none. It is totally theoretical. But the reason I called my book Fake Invisible

13:51.680 --> 13:59.920
Catastrophes and Threats of Doom is because they are focusing on things that nobody can see

14:00.720 --> 14:11.120
and making up stories about. It's impossible because you can't see it. The first rule of

14:11.120 --> 14:17.760
science is observation. You have to observe something. It doesn't have to be with your eyes.

14:17.760 --> 14:23.760
It can be with a microscope or with a microphone or it can be with any tool you can imagine.

14:23.760 --> 14:28.640
Radiation is the other one besides carbon dioxide. Those are the two main ones that are in the

14:28.640 --> 14:36.880
invisible category. So they blame everything on carbon dioxide practically. And then the other

14:36.960 --> 14:43.280
category is remote. And that's why polar bears and coral reefs are the icons. Because again,

14:43.280 --> 14:50.320
hardly anybody can see them or go there. Who goes to the North Pole and counts all the polar bears?

14:50.320 --> 14:57.760
When in fact, and why is it that the media never mentions the treaty that was signed in 1973?

14:57.760 --> 15:03.760
Like it wasn't in a thousand years ago. It was in 1973. The treaty was signed

15:04.560 --> 15:13.440
among all the polar nations, which are six, to end the unrestricted hunting of polar bears in 1973.

15:14.560 --> 15:19.360
Because wildlife biologists went to the governments and said they're killing. It's too

15:19.360 --> 15:24.560
easy for rich people to go up there in a plane and hire a guide and get a polar bear or two.

15:24.560 --> 15:27.120
And there was no restriction. They could take as many as they wanted.

15:28.080 --> 15:34.240
So that was ended and and in force and has been ever since. And that's why the polar bear

15:34.240 --> 15:40.160
population has grown three to five times larger than it was then. Which now I don't even believe

15:40.160 --> 15:45.200
because all we see is photographs of lone polar bears on sheets of ice that are about to

15:46.240 --> 15:55.120
to melt. Yes, their common name is sea bears as in SEA bears. They when they jump off an iceberg

15:55.120 --> 16:01.120
and start swimming, they know where they're going. It's not as if they're going to swim out to see

16:01.120 --> 16:09.840
and drown. More people drown every year than polar bears do. And it is ridiculous to suggest

16:09.840 --> 16:16.000
that a polar bear doesn't know how to figure out things. You see, we know that polar bears can

16:16.000 --> 16:23.360
survive through much warmer periods than what we're in now. Because the three interglacial periods

16:23.360 --> 16:28.480
that came before this one, which is known as the Holocene, it's about 10,000 years into it now.

16:29.120 --> 16:34.720
And so it's about time for it to end like in the next hundreds of years somewhere. We're in an ice

16:34.720 --> 16:42.160
age, but the glacial the glacial maximums of which there have been 40 or more have all occurred

16:42.160 --> 16:48.640
within the last 2.6 million years in the Pleistocene Ice Age. We are now in an interglacial period,

16:48.640 --> 16:54.240
but it's still colder than it was for the 250 million years prior to that. Everything is upside

16:54.240 --> 16:58.880
down, Nadia. Everything's upside down. They're saying there's too much CO2 when there's never

16:58.880 --> 17:03.760
been so little. They're saying it's too hot when it's actually colder than it's been almost a whole

17:03.760 --> 17:08.640
time of the earth right now, because that's why all that ice is on the poles. There's a lot, you

17:08.640 --> 17:14.160
know, and they show a picture of the ice in the summer after six months of sunshine 24 hours a day.

17:14.160 --> 17:19.840
But in the winter, every square inch of the Arctic Ocean plus ocean down even further south

17:19.840 --> 17:25.120
than that is frozen solid. They never show you that one. It's still that way every winter.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.800
And they've got people thinking that the ice is disappearing in the Arctic

17:31.920 --> 17:38.720
and the Antarctic, which it's not. One of the most dire some doom and gloom predictions made by

17:39.440 --> 17:48.400
climate alarmists is that we are in the midst of a abrupt climate change. And it's going to be

17:48.400 --> 17:54.080
methane from the Arctic, which will lead to human extinction. Some scientists such as

17:54.080 --> 18:01.200
Professor Guy McPherson believes it'll be by 2026. And you've recently said that

18:02.160 --> 18:06.560
there's so far from the truth. How is it possible that there are two

18:07.600 --> 18:14.640
sad conflicting theories? Is there not sufficient data and evidence that can be used to refute

18:14.640 --> 18:21.280
disastrous claims like that of Professor McPherson? Yes, there are. It's not difficult. It's not

18:21.280 --> 18:28.960
difficult to explain the history of the temperature and the CO2 on the earth, that people only go

18:28.960 --> 18:37.760
back to 1850 when industrialization began. And they say it's like as if they think the

18:37.760 --> 18:45.680
earth began then. It actually began 4.6 billion years ago. And when modern life emerged, which was

18:45.680 --> 18:52.080
about half a billion years ago, before that it had all been the little tiny unicellular plankton in

18:52.080 --> 18:59.840
the sea. But sexual reproduction occurred about 2.5 billion years ago. The photosynthesis occurred

18:59.840 --> 19:07.360
even earlier than that. So life developed a lot of what we would consider to be very miraculous

19:07.360 --> 19:14.000
processes early on. But when multicellular life emerged, that was the what called the

19:14.000 --> 19:22.640
Cambrian explosion about 540 million years ago. Larger life forms came into being with

19:22.640 --> 19:29.680
organs and flippers, but they didn't have any shells or backbones. They were all just like

19:29.680 --> 19:37.680
jellyfish at first. And then gradually, gradually many of these multicellular organisms learned

19:37.680 --> 19:42.800
to combine calcium with carbon dioxide in the ocean and make shells for themselves.

19:43.760 --> 19:48.080
If you start thinking about all the marine creatures, a huge percentage of them,

19:49.040 --> 19:55.040
including the corals, which is about 50% of all the calcium carbonate that is produced

19:55.040 --> 20:01.840
by marine life. All of the limestone in the earth's crust was made by life. And the marble

20:02.000 --> 20:09.360
and the chalk, the white cliffs of Dover are made of the skeletons of coccolithophores,

20:09.360 --> 20:16.480
which are unicellular plant that makes a shell for itself. And you can imagine how important that

20:16.480 --> 20:24.960
would be. Instead of just being a naked blob of jelly, you now have a thick hard shell to

20:24.960 --> 20:33.280
surround yourself. And it's like a knight in armor. And so that was a huge advance in the

20:33.280 --> 20:40.960
evolution of life. Like there's the crabs and snails and barnacles and clams and oysters. And

20:40.960 --> 20:50.400
it goes on and on and on. And the coral reefs. And so that was a huge benefit. But unfortunately,

20:50.400 --> 20:56.720
inadvertently, it meant that the CO2 in the ocean and the atmosphere, because they are connected

20:56.720 --> 21:01.600
at the surface of the ocean, the ocean and the atmosphere are in equilibrium with regard to

21:01.600 --> 21:07.120
their CO2 content, the ocean containing about 50 times as much CO2 as the atmosphere.

21:08.560 --> 21:13.280
So when these shells started pulling carbon dioxide out of the ocean to make their shells,

21:14.000 --> 21:18.880
it started going down from about 5,000 parts per million at the time that that shell

21:18.880 --> 21:30.400
process was invented to 180 parts from 6,000, 5,000 to 6,000 to 180 at the peak of the most recent

21:30.400 --> 21:38.000
glacial advance. And then this went 20,000 years ago. It went down to went down to 180 parts per

21:38.000 --> 21:43.520
million, which is only 50 parts per million above the death of plants. Because plants don't just

21:43.520 --> 21:52.480
need CO2 to live, they need a certain concentration of it. And 180 parts per million is only 0.018%.

21:54.560 --> 21:59.840
And we all currently, according to most sources, we are 0.04.

22:00.560 --> 22:09.360
Yeah, 0.425 or so. Yes, we have increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 50%.

22:09.600 --> 22:15.040
And this is one of the best things that has happened in the history of life.

22:16.640 --> 22:22.720
And humans did it inadvertently, just like the shellfish inadvertently caused the CO2 to decline

22:22.720 --> 22:30.080
so drastically over half a billion years. We have come back and saved life from a certain demise.

22:31.200 --> 22:35.120
No other species could do this, could find the fossil fuels.

22:35.600 --> 22:42.320
It highlights our ability to adapt. And we are also evil for doing this.

22:43.280 --> 22:48.560
And it's kind of like a death wish, I think. I don't know why these things come about, but there

22:48.560 --> 22:54.240
was a time when people burned women as witches with absolutely no evidence whatsoever of which

22:54.240 --> 23:00.320
we even was, right? And throwing virgins into volcanoes was fairly popular back in the day.

23:00.320 --> 23:09.120
And all through history, there have been ogrums. And the Germans murdering 8 million

23:09.120 --> 23:18.000
people of a certain genetic extraction. I mean, whoa, we can be evil. But the thing is,

23:18.000 --> 23:23.440
this thing about the climate, it's the people who are calling us deniers who are actually the

23:23.440 --> 23:32.080
evil ones, because when you call a person a denier, we're not denying that the climate changes.

23:33.520 --> 23:39.760
So why don't they use straight language? You accuse us of what we are actually believing,

23:39.760 --> 23:44.640
which is that CO2 is a net benefit to life on Earth. That's what we believe.

23:45.920 --> 23:53.120
We're just about to be joined by one of the winners of the 2022 Nobel Prize for Physics,

23:53.200 --> 23:59.440
in our CO2 coalition in Harlington, Virginia, which is right on the border of Washington, DC.

24:00.160 --> 24:05.200
And I was a founding director along with Will Happer and Dick Linsen.

24:05.760 --> 24:11.120
I interviewed Dr. Linsen last week and Professor Happer last year. And I actually

24:11.120 --> 24:16.320
wanted to mention earlier, when you referred to it as a death wish, that Professor Happer said that

24:16.960 --> 24:28.080
this drive towards net zero, it's a suicide pact. Correct. And Dr. Linsen said last week that

24:29.280 --> 24:32.960
it's almost as if the environmentalists have decided to commit suicide.

24:33.760 --> 24:41.520
If net zero were actually achieved, that is the end of net amounts of CO2 going into the atmosphere.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.080
How close do you think we are to that?

24:45.920 --> 24:49.840
It's never going to happen. The only way it could happen is if we adopted nuclear

24:49.840 --> 24:57.200
energy on a large scale. And that could be done. In 100 years, we could basically get off of at

24:57.200 --> 25:06.160
least 50 to 75% of the fossil fuels we're using today. Everything stationary can be provided

25:06.160 --> 25:13.440
by nuclear energy, heat and electricity. My concern here is where will we get our CO2 from?

25:15.680 --> 25:24.960
We get our CO2 from the atmosphere in the ocean. And at this point in history of the earth,

25:24.960 --> 25:30.880
it has been declining steadily for at least half a billion years. Up and down, just like the

25:30.880 --> 25:37.280
temperature goes up and down, but generally we are now, we're in the place to see an ice age.

25:37.280 --> 25:41.120
This is one of 40 or more interglacial periods where it gets a little bit warmer

25:41.760 --> 25:48.000
than it is during the glacial advances. Canada was covered in over a mile of ice from one side to

25:48.000 --> 25:55.040
the other during the most recent glaciation. And so was it during all the previous ones,

25:55.040 --> 26:01.280
of which there were 40. And in between, you get a situation where it's halfway as livable.

26:02.560 --> 26:08.160
Canada, that is, because less than half of it is lived in. It's working on 90% of Canadians

26:08.160 --> 26:13.920
are within 100 miles of the US border for a good reason. The further north you go, the more inhospitable

26:13.920 --> 26:19.920
it becomes. People forget that humans are a tropical species. We are not an arctic species.

26:20.640 --> 26:24.960
We're not polar bears or penguins. We evolved at the equator, and if it weren't for fire,

26:24.960 --> 26:30.800
clothing, and shelter, we couldn't have moved out of Africa. It's the only reason we were able to do so.

26:32.480 --> 26:37.200
So, and those are all three very important things in our lives, fire, shelter, and clothing,

26:37.760 --> 26:41.680
especially if you live in a cold place. You know, I'm in Baja, California,

26:42.480 --> 26:48.320
which is part of Mexico right now, and it's a beautiful warm day, but it gets cold enough here

26:48.320 --> 26:56.560
in the winter down into the teens and tens that if people came here and didn't have fire,

26:56.560 --> 27:02.240
shelter, and clothing, they would die out very quickly. Even here, and I'm at the Tropic of

27:02.240 --> 27:08.560
Cancer, humans could not live at the Tropic of Cancer without fire, shelter, and clothing.

27:08.560 --> 27:13.600
And even at the equator, there's nights that are cold enough that you want to have a big

27:13.600 --> 27:19.120
animal skin on you while you're sleeping. You know, you could call that clothing.

27:19.760 --> 27:24.800
But I'd like to talk about coral reefs for a bit, because there is this myth that they're going to

27:24.800 --> 27:30.960
die if it gets too hot. Funnily enough, though, the most biodiverse coral reefs in the world are in

27:30.960 --> 27:37.200
the warmest ocean of the world, which is the Indonesian archipelago, and that's where there's

27:37.200 --> 27:43.280
over 600 species of coral and over 2,000 species of reef-ish. By far the most biodiverse in the world,

27:43.280 --> 27:48.560
the Caribbean is the next most diverse, and it happens to be the second warmest ocean in the

27:48.560 --> 27:55.840
world. So the truth is, if the world warms, the corals will expand to a much larger range than

27:55.840 --> 28:02.640
they occupy today. That's the truth. And even the people who study coral try to avoid saying

28:02.640 --> 28:06.480
that, because if you say that, it means you don't believe that global warming is going to destroy

28:06.480 --> 28:10.800
the coral, right? And if you don't believe that global warming is going to destroy the coral,

28:10.800 --> 28:16.000
then you're not on our side. And then you won't get any more money from the politicians through

28:16.000 --> 28:20.240
the bureaucrats into the universities. That's where the quiet side of this whole thing is.

28:20.240 --> 28:26.400
Everybody hears the commotion from the media, and from the greens, and from the world economic

28:26.400 --> 28:32.320
forum and all these people. But where the real business is taking place is where politicians

28:32.320 --> 28:38.000
are instructing their bureaucrats to give scientists in the universities where 80% of all

28:38.080 --> 28:43.120
the research in the United States is done, is in universities. And if you're a professor in a

28:43.120 --> 28:47.280
university, you don't go along with the climate thing, you're not getting any money, period.

28:48.000 --> 28:54.880
And with few exceptions, very few exceptions. And so, and this is the consensus is being paid for,

28:55.760 --> 29:02.000
right? And bought, bought and paid for. And that's what's going on. And so then all the noise comes

29:02.960 --> 29:09.840
from the scientists, from the media, from the greens, and they're all includes together making

29:09.840 --> 29:16.400
a whole pile of money out of this. And it is, there have always been doomsday scenarios.

29:17.360 --> 29:22.480
And yet, for some reason, doom has never occurred. I mean, like the end of the earth,

29:22.480 --> 29:27.200
you know, it's just never seems to come about, no matter how often you predict it.

29:27.200 --> 29:35.520
You just feel like going, wake up, people, wake up. Nothing like a good disaster to make the news.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.120
It's human nature's latest thing. Everything is fine today. So we'd have nothing to say.

29:44.560 --> 29:50.800
That is one of the arguments that's the very devoted to the narrative in terms of climate change.

29:50.800 --> 29:58.320
People argue it when it comes to scientists that disagree with the consensus, that they're not

29:58.320 --> 30:03.600
going to be around for long enough to have, you know, their predictions and advice end up killing

30:03.600 --> 30:09.040
people. It's not going to upset them. Well, most of the people who like myself are willing to tell

30:09.040 --> 30:18.240
the truth about this are not in the, in the clutches of some economic necessity. If you're

30:18.240 --> 30:29.760
working for a living and you defy the narrative of consensus about climate disaster, you're,

30:29.760 --> 30:36.560
you're, you know, you're going to be shunned. And, and I am shunned by these people and they call

30:36.560 --> 30:43.360
me names. That's all they can seem to come up with is calling me names. And, and I don't see

30:43.360 --> 30:48.080
what that has to do with science myself. I've never worked for the fossil fuel industry in my

30:48.080 --> 30:52.800
life. But everyone, what else did you do? Yeah, I don't know why. I mean, I hadn't,

30:52.800 --> 30:58.160
there's no record of it. I haven't hidden anything in my, I've been a very open person all my life.

30:58.160 --> 31:04.800
I've never told a lie. And, and that is, that is, that is the truth. I don't tell lies.

31:06.480 --> 31:11.440
Some people do. I think, and some people, I think they know they're lying. I'm not sure.

31:11.520 --> 31:19.040
You can't, you can't see inside a person's brain. But the truth of the matter is, is there is no

31:19.040 --> 31:24.000
evidence of a climate catastrophe. All they're talking about now is extreme weather events,

31:24.000 --> 31:28.320
which have been going on since the beginning of time. And forest fires, for goodness sakes,

31:29.520 --> 31:36.960
most forest fires are caused by people carelessly failing to put out campfires and throwing

31:36.960 --> 31:41.040
cigarette butts out the window and that sort of thing is a lot of them. But lightning has been

31:41.040 --> 31:48.400
here forever, right? And lightning is, causes forest fires. But the reasons that these fires

31:48.400 --> 31:54.160
are so severe today is due to mismanagement. If you, if you imagine back in the day when I was

31:54.160 --> 32:01.760
talking about when all, all the energy was from wood, every end of every summer, the people went

32:01.760 --> 32:06.640
out from cities and towns and gathered all the dead wood in the forest. That's the first day

32:06.640 --> 32:13.280
would take because it's the easiest to take and it's already dry. So this really reduces the,

32:13.280 --> 32:18.720
the chance of a catastrophic wildfire going up into the crown of the trees and starting the whole

32:18.720 --> 32:26.240
place ablaze. That is, if you look at the United States, they, in the West, a huge amount of land

32:26.240 --> 32:30.720
is owned by the federal government, national parks, national forests, Bureau of Land Management land.

32:31.360 --> 32:37.600
So it's controlled from Washington where most of the politicians are from the east of the Mississippi.

32:38.320 --> 32:43.760
Most of the federal lands are west of the Mississippi. Idaho is 70% federally owned.

32:43.760 --> 32:50.880
So they don't have, they don't care really about what happens there. And so the, the, the forests

32:50.880 --> 32:58.080
in the east of the country down along the, the southern states, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana,

32:58.080 --> 33:03.360
they're covered in forest. They almost never have forest fires because they're managed properly.

33:03.920 --> 33:09.680
Because the people who own them want to get the wood, not to have a charred forest left behind.

33:09.680 --> 33:14.720
The people who are, who are owning the federal lands in the western United States don't really care

33:14.720 --> 33:20.320
that much. And then they can use that as a way of saying, look what the climate has done to our

33:20.320 --> 33:24.400
environment. It's causing these forest fires. No, you are causing the forest fires because you

33:24.480 --> 33:30.720
won't let people manage them properly. What got temperate to changes? IPCC reports. Dr. Linsen said

33:30.720 --> 33:35.120
that there's really actually just one working group that deals with science. And now they did not

33:35.120 --> 33:40.000
actually come up with anything that posed an existential threat. Scientists will look at the

33:40.000 --> 33:46.240
data. They won't come up with doomsday predictions, but they'll leave it open-ended and leave the

33:46.240 --> 33:52.960
politicians do what they will. Now the IPCC's reports don't say that there's doomsday coming.

33:53.920 --> 33:58.320
They don't say that. They say the temperature has risen one degree in the last 250 years.

33:59.360 --> 34:04.480
Which is true. We're in a warming period. It's a slight warming period. We've been in cooling

34:04.480 --> 34:09.840
periods and warming periods all through the Holocene. The Holocene was warmer than it is now,

34:09.840 --> 34:16.560
8,000 years ago, until about 6,000 years ago. It was warmer than it is now, even though it's

34:16.560 --> 34:22.240
getting warmer now than it was 200 years ago. It goes up and down. But sometimes it goes up and

34:22.240 --> 34:29.280
down downwards. And sometimes it goes up and down upwards. Just a fact. It wobbles. There's cycles

34:29.280 --> 34:35.120
on cycles on cycles. And there's El Niño and La Niña. And all of these short cycles. And then

34:35.120 --> 34:39.600
there's longer cycles and longer still cycles. And then there's things we just don't even understand

34:39.600 --> 34:46.320
at all. Like why the earth went into another ice age 2.6 million years ago. When there was no ice

34:46.320 --> 34:52.000
on the earth at all for the 250 million years before that. When the Keru Ice Age ended, which

34:52.000 --> 34:59.120
had lasted 100 million years during the Carboniferous period. Extreme weather is one thing. But damage

34:59.120 --> 35:06.080
caused to people is another. The number of people being killed by extreme weather has gone down by

35:06.080 --> 35:13.760
98% in the last 200 years. It's actually just in the last, it's actually just in the last 100 years

35:13.760 --> 35:21.280
since the 1920s. It's been proven that this is the case. And most people who died from weather in

35:21.280 --> 35:30.480
those days was by starvation. Because what the weather did to their crops. It's unbelievable

35:30.480 --> 35:37.360
how much less danger there is for people today than there was just 100 years ago. Much less

35:37.360 --> 35:42.880
danger. And a lot of it is because of fossil fuels and nitrogen fertilizer.

35:45.600 --> 35:51.440
People, I mean it's only 100 years they have to look out there. And to see that there's definite

35:51.440 --> 35:57.920
proof that on a per capita basis there's been a 98% reduction in death from extreme weather.

35:57.920 --> 36:05.120
And that includes all extreme weather of every kind. It's just been published. And it is not

36:05.120 --> 36:09.760
being carried by the mainstream media. I mean they should have this as their top story.

36:10.880 --> 36:15.840
In 2010 this is 40 years after you co-founded Greenpeace. The organization comes out with a

36:15.840 --> 36:21.920
statement saying that you were in fact not a founding member. What is it that you observed

36:21.920 --> 36:28.240
in the organization that led to you walking away? I mean it must have been a really difficult

36:28.240 --> 36:32.240
decision to walk away from something that you were that sincerely passionate about.

36:33.040 --> 36:38.160
It was an easy decision to make because I had no choice. I had no choice for two reasons.

36:38.880 --> 36:45.040
First, much of the environment, we started out with a fairly strong humanitarian orientation to

36:45.040 --> 36:49.360
save civilization from nuclear war. That must mean you care about people at least a little bit.

36:50.000 --> 36:55.200
And it came to the point where the environmental movement including Greenpeace was basically

36:55.200 --> 37:00.400
characterizing humans as the enemies of nature. We are the enemies of the earth. It was sort of like

37:01.360 --> 37:07.200
human beings are the only evil species on the planet. And even cockroaches are better than we

37:07.200 --> 37:13.760
type thing. So this is the philosophical level, high philosophical level of this judgmental idea

37:13.760 --> 37:20.560
that human beings are the enemies of nature. And then came a campaign proposal from people who

37:20.560 --> 37:25.600
had no science education. I was the only one who had a formal science education on the international

37:25.600 --> 37:31.120
board of Greenpeace for the whole of those 15 years. My fellow directors, none of whom had any

37:31.120 --> 37:39.360
formal science education, decided that Greenpeace should start a campaign to ban chlorine worldwide.

37:39.360 --> 37:48.720
That was the slogan. And I said to them, you guys, you gotta be a little more nuanced than that because

37:49.360 --> 37:55.280
chlorine happens to be one of the most important elements for human life that there is. Table salt

37:55.280 --> 38:01.600
for example, is sodium chloride. And it is an essential nutrient. Chlorine, yes, we're talking

38:01.600 --> 38:11.040
about chlorine, which is one of the halogens, which includes fluorine, bromine, chlorine, iodine,

38:11.040 --> 38:16.640
and arginine, I think it's called or something like that. This group of chemicals is one of the

38:16.640 --> 38:23.600
most reactive group of chemicals in the whole periodic table. It's aggressive. And of course,

38:23.600 --> 38:30.320
we know that elemental chlorine gas can kill you really quickly because it combines with everything,

38:30.320 --> 38:38.000
just right like that. The reason there's no chlorine gas around is because it's combined

38:38.000 --> 38:45.600
with something else like sodium. It doesn't. It can't exist freely in the atmosphere. It has to

38:45.600 --> 38:51.920
get attached to something. And it gets attached to lots of things, some of which are the most

38:51.920 --> 38:57.520
important things in medicine. 85% of all our pharmaceuticals are made with chlorine chemistry,

38:58.160 --> 39:04.640
and 25% of our medicines actually have chlorine in them. And table salt, sodium chloride,

39:05.280 --> 39:12.160
which is an essential nutrient for all life, that's why Gandhi marched to the sea to make salt

39:13.120 --> 39:18.800
was because the British were taxing the poor people in India for something that was essential.

39:19.520 --> 39:25.520
And so it was one of his greatest achievements was this making salt by the sea.

39:26.320 --> 39:32.560
And then in addition to that, adding chlorine to drinking water was the biggest advance in the

39:32.560 --> 39:38.640
history of public health and to swimming pools and spas. You don't have a hot tub without chlorine

39:38.640 --> 39:43.360
or bromine pucks floating around in the thing. You don't do that because you don't want to spread

39:43.440 --> 39:50.080
disease. And so I'm going, you guys, you're still going to do this? Have a campaign to van

39:50.080 --> 39:56.320
chlorine worldwide? Yep, we're going ahead. Once we came to the issue of toxicity and chemicals,

39:56.320 --> 40:01.120
you have to have some science. You don't need any science to want to stop nuclear war. You don't

40:01.120 --> 40:05.520
need any science to save 30,000 whales from being killed every year. You don't have to be a whale

40:05.520 --> 40:12.160
scientist for that. But if you're going to deal with chemistry, you have to have some science,

40:12.160 --> 40:19.600
because the first rule of chemistry, in many ways, is the toxicity is in the dose.

40:21.120 --> 40:26.240
So table salt is essential at a small dose. Then you can take too much of it,

40:26.240 --> 40:29.920
but it still doesn't hurt you. You don't need that much of it, but it doesn't hurt you.

40:29.920 --> 40:37.920
Then it starts to hurt you. If you took a cup of salt and put it in your stomach, you're dead.

40:37.920 --> 40:41.600
Also in the final analysis, Greenpeace was hijacked by the political left,

40:41.600 --> 40:45.600
because they were smarter at politics than we were, because we weren't really politicians.

40:46.560 --> 40:53.680
We were campaigners. And we knew how to do that. We knew how to get people's attention.

40:53.680 --> 40:57.600
We knew what the real issues were. And all of a sudden, these guys are saying that chlorine

40:57.600 --> 41:06.720
should be banned. And it was just a fundraising program based on incorrect information. So how

41:06.720 --> 41:12.800
could I be involved in that? So there was no choice. I had to go. I always say I blame

41:12.800 --> 41:19.120
McTaggart. David McTaggart became our chairman. He was kind of a very, very interesting person.

41:20.480 --> 41:28.320
He was friends with the Agat Khan and with the head of the science division in Moscow for Russia.

41:28.320 --> 41:32.640
All kind of high-level people, the person who founded CNN.

41:36.720 --> 41:45.280
He was a real mover in society, but he had no science. And he really believed that everybody

41:45.280 --> 41:50.960
was going to be poisoned by chemicals, the modern civilization, and all the plastics.

41:50.960 --> 41:54.560
You know how people say that they act as though plastic is toxic?

41:54.720 --> 42:00.160
Right? Well, is that why we wrap our food in it? Go on the internet and look for

42:02.400 --> 42:12.480
plastic in the stomachs of albatross chicks. And you'll see these made-up pictures of a dead

42:12.480 --> 42:19.920
albatross chick slaced open, full of plastic. Right? This does not happen in the world.

42:20.800 --> 42:28.560
It is true. It is true that the parents of albatross chicks in the nest bring bits of hard

42:28.560 --> 42:36.000
plastic and other such materials and give it to the chick for its gizzard to grind its food.

42:36.640 --> 42:43.440
Birds don't have teeth, so plastic is actually performing a useful function for seabirds.

42:43.440 --> 42:49.040
They have two stomachs. One has hard objects in it that when the chicks are in this nest,

42:49.040 --> 42:53.840
they can't go out and get it for themselves. But then for the rest of their lives, all birds

42:54.480 --> 43:01.200
ingest hard objects of a certain size and shape to put in their gizzards to grind their food,

43:01.200 --> 43:08.080
because they have no teeth. They can't chew their food. So if a mother bird gives its chick

43:08.080 --> 43:14.960
a squid eight inches long, you know, like that, it goes to the gizzard where it gets ground up,

43:14.960 --> 43:20.320
except for the beak of the squid, which is retained as a hard object to continue helping

43:20.320 --> 43:26.000
digest the food. And this is all well understood for 60 years. It's all been understood. Scientists

43:26.000 --> 43:30.560
at first, when they saw that birds were using plastic as one of the objects that they gave their

43:30.560 --> 43:35.920
chicks to digest their food, were worried about it. But they came to realize that it causes no

43:35.920 --> 43:41.360
harm. As a matter of fact, it works just as well as pumice stones and pieces of wood and

43:41.760 --> 43:48.560
bit nuts that fall off trees into the sea. It's hard to find those hard objects in the sea. There's

43:48.560 --> 43:54.480
no pebbles in the sea, whereas on land birds just use pebbles about the size of a marble

43:55.680 --> 44:01.680
and smaller. So this is all just total fake. And the other thing that plastic does in the sea is

44:01.680 --> 44:08.080
it acts as a substrate, just like driftwood does for marine life to grow on. And then for other

44:08.160 --> 44:13.040
species to eat the marine life that's growing on the piece of plastic. It's like a little floating

44:13.040 --> 44:18.400
reef. Did you know that there is no such thing as the Pacific Garbage Patch, which I'm sure you've

44:18.400 --> 44:23.680
heard of? There isn't such a thing, because it's invisible. It's in the middle of the Pacific Ocean

44:23.680 --> 44:28.000
where Noah can look out the window and see whether it really exists. So they made it up and made

44:28.000 --> 44:33.360
paintings of it. You go on the internet and look for Great Pacific Garbage Patch. You'll find all

44:33.360 --> 44:39.040
these made up cartoon-like things which show this is the Pacific Garbage Patch and they take a brush

44:39.040 --> 44:47.040
and paint a big blob on a map of the earth that they made up. And the only thing that is a real

44:47.040 --> 44:52.720
picture that claims to be part of the Pacific Garbage Patch right underneath it says this is

44:52.720 --> 44:57.280
part of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. I looked at it and it's a big sea of debris in the ocean,

44:57.280 --> 45:02.720
huge sea of debris. And I looked and in the background there were mountains. And I'm going,

45:02.720 --> 45:07.120
there's no mountains in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It turns out this was the debris that was

45:07.120 --> 45:13.280
washed off of Japan during the tsunami that killed 20,000 people. And it was all the towns,

45:13.280 --> 45:17.840
the towns all just destroyed. And that's why there were mountains in the background,

45:17.840 --> 45:22.640
because that was Japan. And they pretended that it was the Pacific Garbage Patch. It's on the

45:22.640 --> 45:28.800
internet. Just go on the internet and say Pacific Garbage Patch, twice the size of Texas, they say,

45:28.800 --> 45:33.920
and growing and growing faster than we ever imagined. And it's not true. The most of the

45:33.920 --> 45:39.280
plastic in the sea is discarded fishing gear. And that is an issue that should be addressed.

45:39.280 --> 45:45.600
But the problem is, is fishermen want their boats to be used for putting fish in and nets in that

45:45.600 --> 45:51.440
work, not discarded, not nets they want to get rid of if they're damaged, which happens a lot with

45:51.440 --> 45:56.720
nets. So they just throw them overboard. So maybe somebody should get together with the fishing

45:56.800 --> 46:03.280
industry and see if they can't help them figure out a way, maybe to hang them off the bow,

46:03.280 --> 46:07.440
so that they're not taking up room in the boat. Because the boat, they want the boat for ice and

46:07.440 --> 46:14.800
fish. Because boats have a limited amount of room in them, fishing boats. So that's why they throw

46:14.800 --> 46:19.360
it away. But it isn't as though people are out there shoveling plastic into the ocean.

46:20.240 --> 46:27.840
You know, it's true that plastic gets into rivers. And especially in Southeast Asia,

46:27.840 --> 46:34.400
it was really quite awful to see. All of the people who are selling vegetables and stuff are

46:34.400 --> 46:40.080
often on the bank of a river. And they just throw everything that they don't want away,

46:40.080 --> 46:43.840
rotten food and plastic wrappers. And the whole thing goes into the river.

46:44.720 --> 46:51.360
I see that you also wonder what the possible end goal could be. Do you think that the

46:51.360 --> 46:57.600
motivation is purely a profit? Because only very few people are benefiting from this.

46:57.600 --> 47:05.440
Do you think it's control? I'd say it's more control than money. Yes, I do. I believe it's a

47:05.440 --> 47:15.920
basically it's a communist kind of approach to the situation. And I'm not joining, I'm afraid.

47:18.240 --> 47:28.640
That's just how I see it. I think many people are innocent, innocently being pulled into this fear.

47:29.600 --> 47:36.080
But many people are doing it on purpose and exaggerating it to such an extent.

47:37.760 --> 47:43.680
The earth is actually doing quite fine right now. The human species can be immensely proud of

47:43.680 --> 47:50.240
itself in retrospect, not because we did it on purpose, but because we have reversed the decline

47:50.240 --> 47:55.280
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which no other species could have done. And this is a good

47:55.280 --> 48:02.720
thing, the replenishment. Every molecule of CO2 we emit came from the environment in the first

48:02.720 --> 48:09.920
place and was turned into fossil fuels or turned into limestone, which we used to make cement.

48:09.920 --> 48:15.520
And that reduces 10% of our CO2 emissions. The other 90% is almost all fossil fuels.

48:16.480 --> 48:22.640
And all of that CO2 that we are emitting from the fossil fuels came from the atmosphere in

48:22.640 --> 48:28.800
the first place. We are just putting it back where it came from. And when it was there, life flourished.

48:30.160 --> 48:38.560
So that's all you need to know. You really don't need to know anything more than that.
