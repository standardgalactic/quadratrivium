1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,800
Yeah, I hear some echoes of people could. Yeah, I think we have to mute. It's us probably.

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,280
So I will mute myself before once you start. So, okay, we were having now like Michael

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:32,000
talk. And I think, where is your screen share? Are you sharing a screen?

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,040
Correct. I'm already sharing the screen. Yeah.

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,600
Can people not see my screen? We don't we don't see your screen, but it might be.

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:54,240
You don't see this? Are people not seeing the slides? It's us. It's us that we are not

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,640
swap video. There you go. Okay. So now we have you. And let's confirm with the other. Yeah,

8
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,760
the audience can see it. So we are fine. Okay. Welcome, Michael. Thank you for participating

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,960
in our conference and workshop and the stage is yours. Very good. Thank you so much for inviting

10
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,800
me. This has been an extremely interesting workshop. Lots of new ideas. And I look forward to sharing

11
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,960
some more information with you and some thoughts. All of the primary papers and if you need to get

12
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,040
in touch with me, these two websites, you can reach me all the papers, the data, the software,

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,960
everything is there. What I'm going to tell you about today is a framework that I've been developing

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,480
based on our empirical data. So probably about 15 years of work at the intersection of developmental

15
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:52,480
biology and computer science that has driven my attempt to pull together some deep ideas

16
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,400
for how to understand this and how to move it forward. And I call this TAME, T-A-M-E, that

17
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,040
stands for technological approach to mind everywhere. And basically it's a framework for

18
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,200
understanding truly diverse intelligences. You'll see what I mean by that based on fundamentals

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,480
of a kind of goal directed behavior in unconventional agents. So the main points

20
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,880
that I would like to transmit today are these. First, that the question of how much agency

21
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,720
or cognition is to be attributed to a particular system has to be treated as an engineering

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,440
problem, not philosophical pronouncements of what various systems can and can't have,

23
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:40,080
but actually an empirical approach to find the optimum level of description to enable control

24
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,040
and prediction of that system. And I'm going to talk about the fact that very diverse intelligences

25
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,160
can actually be directly compared with each other and placed in a sort of the same space.

26
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,760
If we think about the spatiotemporal scale of the goals that these systems are capable of working

27
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,480
towards. So this gives rise to a kind of a model of what I call the cognitive light cone

28
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,720
based on the types of goals that these systems are able to represent and pursue.

29
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,000
And I'm going to show you that synthetic bioengineering and some advances in biology

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,120
provide an incredibly large option space for new bodies and new minds. These new creatures don't

31
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,000
have standard evolutionary backstories in this. They are a very important set of systems for

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,120
impacting our understanding of evolution of what the genome actually does and so on.

33
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,680
And I'm going to show you some very specific examples from developmental biology looking at

34
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,200
morphogenesis as a kind of unconventional collective intelligence, meaning the collective

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,240
intelligence of cells, solving problems in morpho space. That will be the example in which I'm

36
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,680
going to illustrate some of these concepts, but I think they're much, much broader than that.

37
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,680
And I'm going to show you some data showing that developmental bioelectricity provides

38
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,400
an interesting window on the scaling of cognition both during development and during evolution.

39
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,760
So I started this framework prompted by a really interesting conference at the

40
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,960
Diverse Intelligence Summer Institute that Templeton Foundation put on

41
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,800
where we were asked to come up with a way to compare truly diverse intelligences. And this

42
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,800
isn't just humans, apes, birds, and maybe octopus, things like that, but it's actually,

43
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,800
it needs to, a good framework is going to enable us to compare and contrast really unusual creatures,

44
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,440
colonial organisms, swarms like ants and bees and so on, but also synthetic biology, so engineered

45
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,320
novel life forms that never existed before, both unicellular and multicellular. We should be able

46
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,040
to use the same framework with AI, so artificial intelligences, whether embodied or purely software

47
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,640
or whatever. And of course, exobiological agents that we may find during exploration of off the

48
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,680
planet if that ever happens. And the key to this framework is that it has to move experiments

49
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,960
forward. It cannot be pure philosophy, it has to actually suggest, make predictions and suggest

50
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,160
novel capabilities. So the outline for today's talk, I'm going to, isn't basically in three parts.

51
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,520
First, I'm just going to talk about some examples and some, some, some, some ways in which we should

52
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,440
broaden typical cognitive science approaches. Then I will talk about this, this framework,

53
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,640
the philosophical principles, and then some very specific hypotheses for how we can define

54
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,600
selves and how cognition can scale. And then I'm going to show you the vast majority of the talk

55
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,120
is data. So I'm going to show you how we've been using these ideas to understand and control

56
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,920
morphogenesis as a collective intelligence. And then I'm going to show you some novel synthetic

57
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,280
organisms that, that have never existed before. And these are called xenobots. So the first thing

58
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,040
I want to think about is the fact that when we usually think about intelligence and, and, and

59
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,640
cognition and agency, we think about the subject of all of those things, the self. So the self is

60
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:11,040
this construct that is the owner of complex memories of credit assignment among the individual parts

61
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,200
that function together to, to provide positive and negative outcomes. It's the, it's the owner

62
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,160
of goals and, and preferences and things like that. And the interesting thing about this is that

63
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,920
biology shows us that these, these selves are extremely malleable. They change over time,

64
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,720
not just evolutionary time, but actually during the time of the, the time of the organism.

65
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,600
So for example, here's, here's one example. So this is a caterpillar. And it's a creature,

66
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,520
it's a soft bodied kind of creature that crawls and chews plants. And it needs to turn into this

67
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,240
very different type of creature that flies and drinks nectar. And because of that, the brain

68
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,400
is completely different. So the caterpillar brain is quite different from the, from the,

69
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,640
of butterfly or moth brain. And during this process of metamorphosis, that brain is largely

70
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,280
liquefied, the cells, many of the cells die, most of the synaptic connections are broken.

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,440
And a completely new brain is rearranged. This is all during the lifetime of the agent. So if,

72
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,120
you know, if you're philosophically minded, you can ask yourself what it's like to be an agent

73
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,640
during, during the time that your brain is completely reorganized. One of the most amazing

74
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,600
things about this is that the memories, which caterpillars have, in fact, persist through

75
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,360
this process. So the butterfly remembers training that the caterpillars underwent and there's,

76
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,600
there's some nice data on this, you can see reviews of that here. But this is, this is in

77
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,560
fact, not just for, for unusual metamorphosing creatures, all of us made the journey of the

78
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,920
Cartesian cut from a single cell. So we all started life as a single fertilized egg. This is

79
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,400
something that molecular biologists would look and say, this is a machine, this is, you know,

80
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,720
it's a molecular machine. It has lots of biochemical components functioning according to

81
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,120
rules. It's a very nice, you know, it's a very nice piece of physics. And then at some point,

82
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,040
this, this self assembled into one of many creatures in some of which, at least or

83
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,000
possibly all of them have what we consider to be cognition, let's say human in the case of a human

84
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,920
embryo. So all of us went from undertook this journey. And so, so one thing that is clear in

85
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:24,160
biology is that there is no sharp line that is supportable, where you can say this was just

86
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,240
physics and then something happened and now you have a cognitive being. So, so we have to understand

87
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,680
how, how cognition scales gradually across these kind of scales and it modifies gradually, both

88
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:42,240
during evolutionary time scales and the animals own development. So this is another way in which

89
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,200
ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny because we all take this, take this journey. So in fact,

90
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,280
we like to think of ourselves as integrated beings, true intelligences, and then maybe

91
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,400
ants and bees have some sort of collective intelligence. But actually, we are all collective

92
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,400
intelligences. We are all made of parts. We are, in particular, we have collections of neurons

93
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,160
and various other cells. And so when you look through, through life forms, you see that they

94
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,560
are made of nested subunits, not only structurally, we all know that we are made of organs made of

95
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,480
tissues, which are made of cells and so on, not just structurally, but actually functionally and

96
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,280
cognitively because there's this evolution uses this multi scale competency architecture,

97
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,960
where every layer solves problems. So from the swarm to the individual animal to the organs to the

98
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:42,320
cells in the subcellular components, all of these systems solve various kinds of problems in

99
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,880
diverse spaces. Now, what evolution does is reuse some of the same problem solving tricks

100
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,440
in different spaces. Now, we are all very familiar with understanding intelligence when we see it as

101
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,560
operating in three dimensional space, behavioral space. So we see these birds, they know how to

102
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,560
pick up cigarette butts and receive a reward. And we say, okay, that's pretty intelligent,

103
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,120
the bird has learned something. All of our sense organs point outwards. And so we are very familiar

104
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,320
and many animals are very good at detecting agency in the outside world. But if we had

105
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,280
sense organs pointing inwards, let's say a kind of biofeedback where at every step of your life

106
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,960
from childhood, you knew exactly what your liver or your pancreas was doing with respect to what are

107
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,720
the physiological states, what are the actions that it takes, we would then have no problem

108
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,520
recognizing some of their behavior as intelligence. And what I mean by intelligence is simply problem

109
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:46,320
solving and to move to better regions of some state space. And these spaces might be the space of

110
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,160
all gene expression, of course, these are all very high dimensional spaces, I sort of collapse

111
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,440
everything into two spaces here. But the space of all possible gene expression, morpheus space,

112
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,600
which we'll spend the most of the talk about, which is the space of possible configurations

113
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,280
of the body. So anatomy, anatomical space, and physiological space. There are many examples,

114
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,960
your organs and your cells are solving problems in these spaces all the time.

115
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,800
And we should be humble about the fact that when we look at a system and try to understand

116
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,440
how much and what kind of intelligence it has, we are ourselves taking an IQ test because recognizing

117
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,520
goal directed problem solving behavior in a system requires us to be smart enough to notice it,

118
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,920
to notice the appropriate space, and to understand what is the system doing. And many times when we

119
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,880
don't see that, we need to ask ourselves if we're in fact missing something important.

120
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,040
So one of the things we can say about intelligence in all these spaces is basically that a kind of

121
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,960
a generic statement is basically that it's proportional to the ability to stay out of

122
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:58,080
local minima, to have a kind of a wider view of what actions you should take. So that, for example,

123
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,960
you know, this from here to here is the most direct path where this dog can get to where it

124
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,520
wants to go. But actually, if it was willing to have some patience and walk away from it for a while,

125
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,200
it could then do much better. And so there's this sort of local energy barrier that the more

126
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,920
intelligent you are, the more you're able to overcome these kinds of things. And one of the

127
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,640
things that we now are able to do with chimeric and bioengineering technologies is take this

128
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:32,160
multi-scale biological system and replace any, at any level, replace components of this with

129
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,680
new components that might be engineered, and they might be other cells or molecules of other

130
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,480
creatures. And so we can build these composite beings that are not standard issue evolved creatures.

131
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:52,880
So we can replace any level of organization, we can replace with components that are somewhere

132
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,920
on this scale somewhere between evolved and designed. So maybe they're natural, maybe they're

133
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,720
modified, maybe they're completely engineered, and they will have some degree of intelligence,

134
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,760
maybe they're just pure mechanism in the sense of the very passive mechanisms, or maybe they will

135
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,000
be quite intelligent problem solving components. And already we start to see this, right? So you

136
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,800
have humans with various appliances, so basically early stage cyborgs, we have bioengineered animals,

137
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,080
we have synthetic machines like hybrids, which are brains driving robotic bodies and so on.

138
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,440
And so you can see this at every portion, we can start to replace these components, right,

139
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,200
whether with DNA or with tissues and so on. And all of these are going to be somewhere

140
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,720
on this hierarchy. See, what's important about this is once we start changing all of these things,

141
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,600
we can no longer use the familiar touchstones of phylogeny. We can't say, well, this kind of looks

142
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,000
like a fish, so therefore I expect fish level sophistication of cognition, because all of these

143
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,240
synthetic and we'll come back to this, these synthetic creations are not going to have

144
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,560
origins or components that make it very easy to say what's going on. So we need a kind of

145
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,880
cybernetic understanding of cognition that isn't based on what you're made of or how you got here,

146
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,840
but it's actually based on much deeper principles of what your cognition is like.

147
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:28,400
And so that is the beginning of how we started thinking about this approach. And

148
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,680
let's talk a little bit about some of the theory now and then we'll get to the data.

149
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,880
So the foundations, and I only say this because I like to make this explicit, you're going to see

150
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,080
all of this in the next sections, but I'd like to make the philosophical

151
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,680
underpinnings of all this completely explicit, so we all know what's going on. Nothing is hidden here.

152
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,360
The first thing is that I think we need to take evolution and developmental biology very seriously,

153
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,920
and that means doing away with binary categories. When we talk, is it really cognitive? Is it just

154
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,240
physics or does it have real memories? There are no sharp categories here. Everything is very

155
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,960
gradual and we'll talk about that. The point here is that we're not trying to anthropomorphize

156
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,880
simple systems. In fact, nowadays, now that we understand evolution and bioengineering,

157
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,080
I'm not sure there's any such thing as anthropomorphizing in the sense that humans have some sort

158
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,880
of magical properties that can be incorrectly attributed to other types of beings. I don't

159
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,280
think that exists. I think as long as you're appropriately scaling your model to whatever

160
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,880
system you're working with and it's giving you empirical advantages, that's how we have to do

161
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,600
this because there's no other way to do it. I'm going to stick very closely to an engineering

162
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,400
approach where I'm not worried about talking about goals in the cybernetic sense. I'm not

163
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:03,680
talking about trying to avoid attributing too much agency to things because attributing too much

164
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,280
agency is just as bad as not attributing enough to an engineer. These are identical errors.

165
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,000
We'll talk about the fact that agents are a patchwork of multiple unconventional intelligences

166
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,760
at different levels. I don't believe there's any magic in the material. There's nothing really

167
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,040
magic about synapses or protoplasm or anything else. We're going to be material independent

168
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,680
here. I really want to understand biology, which Chris Langton refers to as life as it can be.

169
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,920
Not zoology, not just the types of plants and animals we have here now, but actually

170
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,560
what's unique and important about all cognitive systems. One of the things that

171
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,120
this framework does from an engineering perspective is simply say that there's a

172
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:01,200
continuum, a smooth continuum with some waypoints along this journey, where the way that you

173
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,640
understand the cognitive capacity of whatever system you're dealing with is really defined by

174
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,040
what is the most efficient, most optimal way to interact with that system, the way to

175
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,560
change the way the system functions. If you're dealing with a certain class of hardware systems,

176
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,760
like clocks, for example, your only option is modification of the hardware at the lowest level.

177
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,600
You're not going to teach it anything. You're not going to convince it of anything. Hardware

178
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,280
modification is your only option. Then there's a more interesting class of devices like

179
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:43,280
thermostats, which are a little further along because they have an encoded setpoint. They spend

180
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,760
energy to maintain a specific goal state, and you can interact with them in a very interesting way.

181
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,440
You can rewrite or alter the goal state, and then the machine will now pursue that goal,

182
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,440
let's say a different temperature range, without you having to rewire the hardware. You don't have

183
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,800
to change the hardware of the system. In fact, you don't even have to know about the hardware.

184
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,560
You don't have to know how it works. As long as you know what the setpoint is,

185
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,640
you can recognize where it's encoded and so on. Then there's a whole other class of systems

186
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,360
like this, where you actually need to know even less about what's going on because you can train

187
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,480
them. Human beings have been training animals for thousands of years without knowing any neuroscience,

188
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:31,280
because they appreciated the important fact that systems like this can be modified based on

189
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,600
stimuli, based on rewards and punishments, and you can actually rely on the system itself to

190
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,840
reconfigure its own internal mechanisms in terms of plasticity and various other things,

191
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,640
and you don't need to do that. You don't need to micromanage it. You don't even need to know

192
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,640
how it works. You just need to understand how to motivate the system, how to communicate with the

193
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,760
system. Then we get to some very advanced creatures here, where you can actually communicate not

194
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,360
simply with rewards and punishments but actually with cogent reasons for doing things. This is a

195
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,720
very engineering approach because the idea is not to have philosophical feelings about whether

196
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,520
thermostats do or do not have real desires. The point is actually for any given system,

197
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:17,680
well in any given let's say novel biological or novel engineered system, the task is very simple.

198
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,720
Which kind of model gives you the best prediction of control? Using these kind of models on these

199
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:30,400
systems will give you nothing of use, but actually using these kind of models on sophisticated systems

200
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,320
actually leaves a lot on the table as far as capabilities, and this is one of the limitations

201
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:41,200
of modern molecular medicine, is that the assumption is that everything is a piece of passive

202
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,360
hardware like this and must be dealt with at the hardware level. Genomic editing,

203
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,600
rewiring, pathways, protein engineering, everything is focused on the hardware. We've

204
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,480
actually done a lot of work showing that some of these other approaches are much more powerful

205
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,520
in medical kinds of circumstances where you're trying to get the system to do something complex.

206
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,240
One way to think about how all of these different very diverse types of systems can be related to

207
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,520
each other is simply to try to map, and again I've collapsed space into one dimension. This is

208
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:24,160
almost like an Minkowski kind of diagram where we can plot on a diagram of space and time what is

209
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:30,320
the scale of the goals that a given system is able to pursue. Now remember this is not a diagram of

210
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,160
how far a system can sense or how far away it can act, but actually the size of the goals that a

211
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,640
system is able to pursue. So if you're a bacterium or something or a tick or something like that,

212
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,840
you are only interested in very local concentrations of certain compounds. You may have a little bit

213
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,360
of memory going backwards, you may have a little predictive capacity going forwards,

214
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:56,240
but everything you're doing is in a very small radius of goal-directed activity. You're only

215
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,440
interested in very local things, and in fact you're not capable of caring about things that are very

216
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,800
far away. So it forms a kind of cognitive light cone of the things that your cognitive system is

217
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,400
capable of doing, and so we can think about other animals that may have some pretty good memory going

218
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,560
backwards, a little bit of predictive capacity going forwards, but still unable to really care

219
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,560
about things that are going to happen two months from now in the next town. It's just impossible

220
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,960
for some of these, but if you're a human, for example, you might have an enormous light cone.

221
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,240
In fact, uniquely among animals, you might care about things that will for sure take longer than

222
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,080
your lifespan. Some of your goals are actually not achievable because your lifespan is not as

223
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,760
big as your goal space, and then we can imagine all sorts of other shapes for possible alien or

224
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,880
synthetic kinds of creatures, and of course, all of this is nested. So we are a patchwork of

225
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,880
modules within modules, each of which is capable, whether in physiological space or anatomical space

226
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,480
or behavioral space, contain various sizes of goals, very large, very small, and so on.

227
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,960
Now, what's really interesting is that the scale of these cells can change quite rapidly.

228
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,000
So here, this is one cell. This is a lacrimaria. There's no brain. There's no nervous system.

229
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,160
This is one cell that is handling all of its anatomical, physiological, behavioral, metabolic

230
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,720
needs at the level of a single cell. Now, these cells, you know, relatives of these single cells

231
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,960
can collaborate together to work on very large things. Here, you see a multicellular body.

232
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,000
This is a salamander. If you amputate the limb, the cells immediately begin to grow. They will

233
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,120
continue to grow and shape a new limb until it's complete, and then they stop. So we'll talk in

234
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,880
a minute about what this is. This is an anatomical homeostasis where the setpoint is very large. All

235
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,840
of these cells are solving a problem in anatomical space. They start out in a region of anatomical

236
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,200
space that's not good. They want to get to the much better region. That is their goal,

237
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,400
and they know how to, the collective is able to get there. So that's the scaling of goals that

238
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,880
occurs during evolution, but there's actually a reduction that takes place, and we call that cancer.

239
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,800
So what happens is when individual cells, and this is a human glioblastoma, when individual cells

240
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,880
become disconnected, functionally disconnected, I'll show you how this works, functionally

241
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,720
disconnected from these large-scale goals, they revert back to an ancient unicellular amoeba-like

242
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,000
lifestyle where their only goals are to reproduce and to optimize certain metabolic functions,

243
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,200
which means migrate wherever life is good. So the boundary between self and world,

244
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,080
in this case, these cells basically treat the rest of the body as just an external environment.

245
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,840
They're not more selfish than any other biological construct. They're equally selfish,

246
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,480
just that the self is not very small. So that boundary between self and world can grow and

247
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,320
shrink. And so the way you can schematize it is simply this, that you have individual cells,

248
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,360
and this takes place at many layers. I'm just going to introduce this with this example of cells.

249
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:09,440
So individual cells have some degree of being able to compute and remember and make predictions about

250
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,760
states of their local environment. But when they join into networks, these, and in particular,

251
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,480
I'm going to talk about electrical networks, these networks are actually have a lot, have higher IQ.

252
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,720
They're not only measuring information from wider spatial areas, meaning they're

253
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,840
integrating lots of signal spatially, but they actually have higher computational capacity,

254
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,080
and they're able to have larger scale goals. And so this is what we see. You can sort of

255
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:45,840
track the width and space and time of what these cells are concerned with. And here's a very important

256
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:56,160
component of this, which is stress, this idea that what stresses different kind of agents

257
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,400
is basically a delta between your goal states and the state you're in now. Stress is what drives you

258
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,880
to make changes, whether it be through gene expression or physiology or behavior, to get

259
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,600
closer to your goals. So stress is a kind of metric. But what's very interesting about stress

260
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:18,000
isn't just that delta, stress is the ability to export that delta to your neighbors.

261
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,800
So the idea is that all of these cells are able to measure states much larger than what

262
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:32,080
individual cells can care about, and thus reduce the delta for much more complex states.

263
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,520
So one can say that if you tell me what you're stressed about, I can make a pretty good guess

264
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,040
about your cognitive sophistication. So if the most complicated thing that could possibly stress

265
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,000
you is local glucose level, then you're probably something like a bacterium. If you're stressed

266
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,120
about the state of the economy on earth, then you're probably a human level or above. Being able

267
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,920
to be stressed by complex large scales of events is a very strong driver of sophistication. And so

268
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:08,640
what you can see, now let's look at some data here. What you can do is you can introduce oncogenes,

269
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,000
in particular human oncogenes, into normal cells in this frog embryo. This is a tadpole. So here's

270
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,520
the eye, here's the gut, the spinal cord is back here. So we can introduce these oncogenes.

271
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,080
And what you can see, the first thing that happens when these oncogenes are active is they

272
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,040
cause the cells to detach electrically from their neighbors and to enter an aberrant bioelectrical

273
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,600
state. This is a voltage map, and I'll show you in a minute, we use this a lot. We map the electrical

274
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:40,240
state of these cells. And here they are, you can actually catch them converting to this kind of

275
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,800
ancient amoeba-like state. And the most important thing is that you can actually suppress this

276
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,760
process, despite the fact that the oncogene is there. If you grab control of the bioelectric

277
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,280
state of the cell by co-injecting an ion channel, that's going to, even though the oncogene is very

278
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:03,840
strongly expressed, there may be no tumor because you're managing the goals that these cells are

279
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,000
going to follow. They are now connected to their neighbors, and they're all working towards making

280
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,680
a nice skin muscle and everything else. One of the most important things that evolution discovered

281
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:23,600
to do that is this thing called a gap junction. So gap junction is this, it's a primitive synapse,

282
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,320
it's an electrical synapse used throughout the body that enables cells to directly communicate

283
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:37,760
with each other to directly connect their intercellular miliars. And what that means is that

284
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,440
traditional signaling like this, you have one cell and it produces some kind of signaling factor,

285
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:51,440
and it diffuses and this cell can feel it. It's very easy for these cells to remain separate

286
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,200
and keep their identity because once you receive a signal like this, you know it came from the

287
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,600
outside. And so you can ignore it, you can remember it or you can not remember it. This

288
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,920
cell has its set of memories and this cell has its set of memories about past events that have

289
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,720
happened, and it's very easy for them to be separate. But once cells become coupled by these

290
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,760
gap junctions, something very interesting happens, the information that comes across does not have

291
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,040
any metadata about the owner. So anything that happens to this cell that triggers some kind of

292
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,080
second messenger response that serves as a memory engram of that experience,

293
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,000
once that propagates into this cell, this cell now has no way to tell whether that information

294
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,440
originated related to this cell or in fact it came from this cell. So all of the experiences

295
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,840
and prior history of this cell are now shared by them both. They cannot separate who's who,

296
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,760
it's a kind of mind meld, so to speak, because their internal miliures are linked in an important

297
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,760
way. And so now a lot of their individuality is really stripped, right? You now get this one

298
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:04,400
system with a larger network, larger IQ, lots of memory of what happened to both cells,

299
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,920
but it's no longer possible to keep that very strict separation and this is how goals scale.

300
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:16,800
So what you can do, and we're making some very rigorous models of this, is you can start with

301
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,600
very simple homeostatic loops, single cells, all they do, let's say pH, right? All they do is they

302
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,240
sort of, they measure the pH, they compare to set point, and then they either load, acid load,

303
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,960
or efflux, that's it. And so these very small, very humble goals, once you start connecting

304
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,000
these cells by gap junctions, you have a bioelectrical medium, you have this excitable medium

305
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,920
that's able to store and process very large states as goals. And this is something that's

306
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:47,120
been worked a lot in Hopfield Networks and other kinds of systems. So we are making those kind

307
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,920
of models to understand large scale memories, in particular pattern memories, as a scaling of

308
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,360
simple homeostatic units in electrical networks, right? It's a kind of a connectionist approach.

309
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,760
So let's look at some real data and let's see what you can do with all this.

310
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,560
And so we'll do two things. We'll talk about morphogenesis as a collective intelligence,

311
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,680
and then we'll look at this novel proto-organism, okay? And we're going to try to understand

312
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,080
how these goal memories are actually stored and processed, so the mechanisms

313
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,000
by which collective intelligences of cells store set point information. So the first thing

314
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:30,240
I just want to mention is that there are, there's huge plasticity in living things,

315
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,320
which has really important implications for evolution. This is a tadpole that we've made.

316
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,080
There are no eyes in the primary where they're supposed to go. So these are nostrils, here's

317
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,640
the brain, here's the gut. So what we've done is we suppressed the primary eyes, but we've,

318
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,320
we induced an eye on the tail, and we can have a separate discussion about how we do that,

319
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,080
we do that through the techniques that I'm talking about today. We induce the eye on the tail,

320
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,160
and we have this machine that tests these animals for visual learning and basically trains them for

321
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:03,040
certain behaviors and visual cues. We find out that these animals can see perfectly well.

322
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,360
This eye synapses onto the spinal cord, not the brain, and their behavior is quite normal.

323
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,760
They can learn, they can see, they have very nice, very nice visual behaviors,

324
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:26,960
and so what this means is that the ability of evolution to explore the various configurations

325
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,600
is greatly potentiated by the fact that if things happen, let's say there's a mutation that moves

326
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,600
the eye, no problem, your behavioral repertoire doesn't automatically fall apart such that now

327
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,480
your fitness is very low. In fact, the animal can, the animal can still function, and then you can

328
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:50,160
explore other consequences of that mutation. So this is really important, and this ability,

329
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,640
this plasticity, and this ability to handle novel circumstances, that's the key here,

330
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,680
is the novelty. This animal evolved for millions of years to process visual input from the eye

331
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:06,400
fields, but one changed and it can handle this. This is another example of problem solving in

332
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,600
physiological space. So here's a flatworm, these are plenarium, I'm going to show you much more

333
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,440
of this. These flatworms have this amazing property of regeneration. So if you cut off their heads,

334
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,000
for example, they will regrow a new head. In fact, they regrow everything. So what we found is that

335
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,920
if you take one of these plenarians and you expose them to barium chloride, so barium is a non-specific

336
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,520
potassium channel blocker, it's a really bad problem because now these cells can't pass potassium.

337
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:39,200
So the heads of these plenaria literally explode. Overnight they just go head deep

338
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,840
progression, they literally explode. But what's incredible is that over the next couple of weeks,

339
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,200
if you leave the animal in the barium, they will regrow brand new heads that are completely normal,

340
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,400
that are barium adapted. They have no problem with barium whatsoever. So what we did was we

341
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:00,400
did some transcriptomic analysis to simply ask the question, what new genes are expressed in

342
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,120
these animals that are not expressed in these animals? How is it that they're barium adapted?

343
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,000
What happened? And it turns out it's actually a very small number of genes that was changed

344
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,320
in order to do this. So now think about the critical part here is two things. One is that

345
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,040
barium is not anything that plenaria find in nature. So there's never been evolutionary selection

346
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,960
to put up with barium. That's a completely novel. And the other thing is that cells in the system

347
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,160
don't reproduce quickly the way bacteria do. So you can't use some sort of a selectionist

348
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,800
explanation that basically everybody tries random sets of gene expression and whoever survives,

349
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,400
repopulates the head. There's no time for that. These cells don't turn over that fast.

350
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,120
So it's almost a problem here. Think about this problem. You have tens of thousands of different

351
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,040
genes that you can turn on and off. I visualize this as a nuclear reactor control room. Your cells

352
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,000
are poisoned. You have this physiological stressor. The cells are poisoned. Everything's melting down.

353
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,320
You have to find a very small number of genes that you're going to up and down regulate to solve

354
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,440
this problem. You've never seen this problem before. How do you know which genes you're going

355
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,920
to turn on and off? And so part of that might be some sort of generalization from other problems

356
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,720
you've had that may have been similar. For example, excitotoxicity, epilepsy, things like

357
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,040
that may be similar to this, but it requires an incredible amount of problem-solving ability to

358
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,880
navigate that transcriptional space, that space of all gene expression, to find exactly what you're

359
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:34,960
looking for. So that's an example in physiology. Now let's look at examples in anatomy. So this

360
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:42,720
here is a cross-section through the kidney tubule of a nut of a salamander. And if you look, the

361
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:50,880
normal tubule has eight to 10 cells or so that work together to build a lumen of a particular

362
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:56,640
size. These tubules have a particular diameter. What you can do is you can make these nuts with

363
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,520
progressively larger cells. And you do that by inducing extra copy numbers of their chromosomes.

364
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,920
Amazingly, the cells put up with it and they just simply get bigger. The cells get bigger.

365
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,800
As the cells get bigger, what you will see, and this isn't our work. This goes back to the 40s,

366
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,600
what you will see is that fewer and fewer cells are now working together to make basically the

367
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,880
same size lumen. So they're adjusting the number of cells based on this really novel and unexpected

368
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,600
outcome of having to build a salamander with much larger bricks. So if we had robotics building

369
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,840
something, you could give it a completely different size of brick and it would make adjustments and

370
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,680
things would still work. We don't have anything like that. The most amazing part of this is that

371
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,440
if you make cells that are truly enormous, what will happen is just one cell will bend

372
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,440
around itself and achieve the same outcome. So completely different molecular mechanisms,

373
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:56,400
not cell-to-cell communication, but now cytoskeletal bending that gets you to the same place using a

374
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,840
different set of molecular components in service of a large-scale anatomical feature. So this is

375
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:12,080
very much looks like a kind of top-down control where the goal of making a tubule can be implemented

376
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,360
with diverse, it's got that degeneracy, it can be implemented with diverse molecular mechanisms

377
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:25,360
and the system executes whatever it needs at the lower levels to maintain the correct region of

378
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:30,080
anatomical space at the higher levels. We don't understand how this works, but it fits nicely

379
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,440
William James' definition of intelligence, which is same goal through different means,

380
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,640
the ability to reach your goal when things are changing, including in this case, not just changes

381
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,840
of external environment, but changes of your own components. Your cells are now way bigger than

382
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,320
evolution prepared you for and you can still do what you need to do. Here's another example,

383
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,000
this is a frog. Frogs, unlike salamanders, normally do not regenerate their legs and so

384
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,880
what we've done is in some of our work that aims towards regenerative medicine, we've figured out

385
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,720
how to make them regenerate their legs. When you do that, something very interesting happens. This

386
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:13,040
is an early leg. Here's a toenail, here's some toes. These early legs don't look anything like

387
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,480
the way that legs normally develop. Eventually, they get to the same place and they make a very

388
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,080
nice frog leg at the end, but the intermediate paths are not like developmental strategies at

389
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,720
all. In fact, they look kind of like a plant really. It's just a different way to navigate

390
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,440
morpho space to get to the same outcome. What you see here is the biology has this incredible

391
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:40,480
plasticity of behavior, of physiology, and of anatomical construction to get to the same goals

392
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,480
via very different paths and as I'm going to show you in a minute, also from diverse starting

393
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,160
positions. That plasticity, that intelligence of these systems is really important to understand

394
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,680
and as we think about shape, we have a very basic question. Where is anatomy specified in the first

395
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:04,160
place? You start life as a collection of blastomeres, your bunch of cells descended from the egg and

396
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,320
this is a cross-section of a human torso. This is amazing. Look at this incredible and variant

397
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,680
order. All of the cells, the organs, everything is in the right position, the right orientation,

398
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:30,560
the right location relative to each other. How does it know where these things should actually go?

399
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:37,200
People naturally say the genome, but of course, we know how to read genomes now and what's in

400
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,480
the genome is the specification of the micro-level hardware. DNA specifies the proteins. There's

401
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,680
nothing in the genome that directly talks about anatomical size, shape, symmetry type. It's all

402
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,680
about the micro-level hardware. We need to understand how does this order arise? We need to understand

403
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:02,480
if part of it is missing. How do we repair or edit this? How do we get the cells to rebuild?

404
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,440
And then as engineers, we want to go one step further and ask, well, what else could these cells

405
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,280
build and how could we convince them to build something completely different than their default

406
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,880
outcome? And so I've already shown you this, that these individual cells are very competent

407
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:23,760
on their individual cell scale, but it gets much more interesting in examples like this.

408
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,560
This here, what you're seeing here is that this is a normal tappel. So here are the eyes, here's

409
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,520
the brain, here's the gut, and these tappels need to become a frog. In order for a tappel to become

410
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,400
a frog, they have to rearrange their face. So this means that they have to move their jaws,

411
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,720
have to move forward, their eyes have to move inward, everything has to move. And it was thought

412
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:49,280
previously that somehow the genetics basically tells each organ the direction and the amount to

413
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,400
move because then you can always go from a standard tappel to a standard frog. So what we did was we

414
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,040
made these, we call them Picasso frogs. They are completely mixed up. Everything is in the wrong

415
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,560
place. The jaws are off to the side. The eyes are on the back of the head. Everything is moved

416
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,200
around. And when you do this, what you find out is that they still make largely quite normal

417
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,400
frogs because all of these organs will move around in unnatural paths. In fact, sometimes

418
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,960
they go too far and they actually have to have to come back. They will keep moving until a correct

419
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,960
frog face is built. So what the system actually does is the genetics doesn't specify the movements.

420
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:33,760
The genetics specifies the seed that constructs a machine that minimizes error. It's able to,

421
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,240
from novel starting configurations, it's progressively able to minimize the delta

422
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,920
between where we are now and what the correct face is, which obviously raises some important

423
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,920
questions. How does it know what the correct frog face looks like? So in my group, what we've been

424
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:54,000
doing is this is kind of the standard model of developmental biology where you have gene

425
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,440
regulatory networks that turn each other on and off. Some of these genes make proteins that are

426
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,360
sticky or they diffuse or they're doing various things. So then there's this parallel physics

427
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:09,040
that goes on and then there's this process of emergence where if lots of individual pieces

428
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,160
do execute these local rules, then eventually something very complex happens like this nice

429
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,200
style manner. So this is all true. This is all happens. Of course, there is a feed forward,

430
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,960
a emergent component to this, but there's actually also a very important set of feedbacks

431
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,880
that occur both at the level of physics and genetics and we're going to talk about the

432
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:36,160
physical one here today that basically executes a loop of anatomical homeostasis

433
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,200
when the system is perturbed from its normal target morphology and this might be with injury,

434
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:49,440
with pre-cancerous conversions, with teratogens, mutation, anything that takes the system away

435
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:56,960
from that's correct shape kick starts cascades that will try to get back to the correct location

436
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:04,400
in morpho space. So what we needed to know was can we find the storage mechanism for the set

437
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,560
point, right? Every homeostatic process has a set point and so what you want to do is you want to

438
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,200
find the storage mechanism of the set point and you want to know how to change it. Can we learn

439
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,160
to read and write these set points and this is very important for the kind of biomedical approaches

440
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:24,480
that we're really focused on in my group because making changes here, which is what all of molecular

441
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,560
medicine tries to do is to make changes somewhere down here is incredibly difficult as a means of

442
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,040
changing what we really care about which is anatomy, which is solving birth defects and

443
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,800
traumatic injury and aging and things like this because reversing this to be able to decide what

444
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,720
changes do you need to make is incredibly hard. This is an inverse problem that's probably

445
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:51,600
unsolvable to try to in general to try to reverse this highly non-linear highly recursive process

446
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,800
to say what do I need to do at the micro level to get me to a desired system level state.

447
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,040
So what we would like to do is we'd like to change the set point, leave all of this intact. The cells

448
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,520
are very good at implementing different set points. We just like to change the set points. So where is

449
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:12,080
it encoded? So we took our inspiration from the brain. We know how this works in brain brains are

450
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:18,000
an excellent system for maintaining behavioral set points and being intelligent about getting to

451
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,360
those set points. So we said, how does this work in the brain? Well, in the brain, you've got some

452
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:30,000
cellular hardware that basically is a set of electrical networks that is the home of the

453
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,200
interesting electrical dynamics, which you might call the software because it's able to be changed

454
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,160
by experience and so on. And what people in neuroscience are doing is this project called

455
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,000
neural decoding. So the commitment is that if you were to read and be able to decode all of the

456
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,440
electrical activity in the brain, you could infer the the memories, the preferences, the

457
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,360
goal states, you know, that's where it's all encoded. It's all encoded in the electrochemical

458
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:00,160
dynamics of what this hardware is doing. And what the nervous system is using all this for is to

459
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,160
coordinate muscles in three dimensional space so that you can move around and do various things.

460
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,720
What did evolution, where did this come from? You know, in evolution, this is a brain didn't

461
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,800
just appear out of nowhere. These electrical systems are actually ancient, even bacterial

462
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,600
biofilms have all of this stuff. So what did this look like before we had brains before we had

463
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:26,000
muscles for large scale behavior? It looked actually surprisingly similar. It we have the

464
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,280
exact same scheme. So you have all cells in the body are actually producing these these electrical

465
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,880
dynamics through the network. And what you can do and this is a video of a early frog embryo,

466
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,400
we're tracking the voltage, this is not a model or a simulation, this is real data,

467
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,720
you're looking at all the electrical dynamics, as you might when you look at a brain,

468
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,600
that we could try to read and we could test the hypothesis that these electrical dynamics

469
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,840
are the medium in which the collective intelligence of these cells is making decisions,

470
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,680
who's going to be anterior, posterior, left, right, how many heads do we have and things like

471
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,720
that. So it's a very parallel project to what neuroscience is doing, but taken away from sort

472
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,880
of generalized away from neurons and asked about all cells. So just again, to nail this down,

473
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,880
all cells, this is developmental bio electricity, all cells have ion channels,

474
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,000
all cells set electrical resting potentials, they communicate those through gap junctions,

475
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,920
which we met a few slides ago, that can communicate them through to their to their neighbors using

476
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:31,840
the exact same mechanisms. And here you can you can read about how we think that that that

477
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:38,400
coordinating problems in morphospace was the basis of intelligence in behavior when evolution

478
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,880
pivoted from just coordinating the body shape to actually running around in three dimensional

479
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:51,840
space by using muscles and sense organs and things like that. So let's let's think about

480
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,800
how then if I'm making the claim that that these bio electrical patterns are a kind of cognitive

481
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,520
proto cognitive medium for making decisions in anatomical space and I'm just going to show you

482
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,920
want some examples of that. So here's our planarian, here's the flatworm, here are the eyes, the head,

483
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,960
here's the tail. What we can do is we can first ask, let's look at gene expression, which of these

484
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,800
cells think they're part of the head? Well, it's this one, these blue cells here, right? So there's

485
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,640
anterior gene expression in the head, there's none in the tail, that's very good. So it's supposed

486
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,400
to be when you cut off the head and the tail, this middle fragment remembers exactly what goes at

487
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,240
each end and pretty soon you have a new planarian, one head, one tail, fine. Now here's another planarian,

488
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,760
again, one head, one tail, again, anterior gene expression in the in the head, that's fine.

489
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,800
When you cut this guy, you get something amazing, which is a two headed form. Now this is not photoshop,

490
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:48,160
these are these are real animals. Now, why would this animal with normal gene expression and normal

491
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,600
anatomy, why would this animal suddenly, by the way, this process is 100% of fidelity, you know,

492
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,480
it's habit, it's very hard to make them make a mistake, they always basically do this correctly.

493
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,160
Why would they suddenly make a two headed animal? Because in the meantime, what we did was we looked

494
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:11,120
at a bioelectrical circuit that, oops, that we looked at this, this bioelectrical circuit,

495
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:17,520
and we realized that there might be some, there might be a gradient, some electrical communication

496
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:23,760
that allows these cells to remember how many heads they're supposed to have and where the heads go.

497
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,560
And so what we did was we learned to, to, to suppress this, and this is not with applied

498
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:34,960
electric fields or magnets or anything like that, this is by using RNA interference and specific

499
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:42,000
drugs to target ion channels, target the native machinery by which these cells produce the voltage

500
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:50,640
gradients. And what we found is that these animals actually make two headed to these,

501
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,640
these, what, once, once the electric circuit is perturbed in a very specific way,

502
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,040
actually make two headed animals. And one of the most amazing aspects of these,

503
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,520
of these two headed animals is that, and I keep calling this a memory, here's why,

504
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,560
if you were to recut this animal again, in plain water, no more manipulations of any kind. So

505
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,640
you chop off the primary head, you get rid of this ectopic secondary head, if you thought some of

506
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,200
these cells were, you know, epigenetically reprogrammed to be ahead, fine, they, we throw them away,

507
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,680
all we leave is this nice normal gut fragment. And that was nothing weird about that, about

508
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:28,240
this gut fragment that the genetics are unchanged. And so you might think that it should just

509
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:33,040
regenerate a normal planarian, but that's not what happens. They regenerate these two headed

510
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,600
forms. And if you cut those, they still regenerate as two headed forms. And this is basically

511
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:43,040
permanent. And we now know how to change that circuit back with a, with another brief, bi-electrical

512
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
drug stimulation, change it back to being one headed. So the question of how many heads a

513
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
planarian has, or is supposed to have, is quite interesting. The default that, that the hardware

514
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,720
specified by the genome will make is one, but that's not really where the information is stored.

515
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:06,000
The information is stored, as I'll show you momentarily, in the real time electrical state of a

516
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,040
circuit that tells these cells what the target morphology of a correct planarian is. It is the

517
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,040
set point. And that set point is not genetic. The genetics here are untouched. We didn't edit

518
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:22,160
the genome or anything like that. We, we changed the encoding of what the correct state is

519
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,000
considered by these cells when they are injured. And so this meets all the properties of memory.

520
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,680
It's long-term stable. It's rewritable. It has conditional recall, which looks like this. So

521
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,360
the reason that, that this guy made a two headed animal is that we looked at the bi-electrical

522
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:44,560
circuit. Here's what a normal one state looks like. The voltage here just tells you one head.

523
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,560
And what we did was we altered it. And it's a little messy. The technology is still being worked

524
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:54,880
out. But basically what we did was we induced a different pattern memory in the exact same kind

525
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,880
of body. So this says when you are injured, you will build to the target morphology. And this

526
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,920
is what the correct planarian target morphology looks like. Make two heads. And that's what it does.

527
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:12,720
So to be super clear, this electrical map is not the memory of this existing animal.

528
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:18,800
This is a memory of this one headed animal. So a one headed body, a normal, a normal body can

529
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:24,000
store at least one of two different representations of what a correct planarian should look like.

530
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,480
So this is what I mean when I say the bi-electrical state is the

531
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,840
protocognitive medium of this collective intelligence. The cells are literally keeping

532
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,600
a representation, a visible, I mean, we can read this now and we can rewrite it,

533
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:40,880
a visible bi-electric representation of what they should do if they get injured. Until they get

534
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,120
injured, this pattern is ignored. It's a latent memory. It doesn't do anything. Once it gets injured,

535
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:49,680
then you see what it is because it guides them to make this two headed one. Now,

536
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,840
this kind of approach can make ectopic heads of the same species. And that's kind of

537
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,040
sufficiently surprising. But we can go further than this. And it turns out that what you can

538
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:08,320
also do is push the tissue to recall memories that belong to different species. So here is

539
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:14,640
one planarian species that has a triangular head. You chop off the head. You perturb the electrical

540
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,400
network in a particular way where you basically prevent the cells from communicating with each

541
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:24,480
other very well for 48 hours. During that time, everything gets kind of confused. You withdraw

542
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,360
the drug, the network settles back down to a stable attractor. When it does, that attractor

543
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,080
sometimes is the correct one. So sometimes you get a nice triangular head. Other times it lands

544
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:40,080
in the wrong attractor that actually belongs to other species of worms. So you can get round heads

545
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:47,920
like this S-Mediterrania. You can get flat heads like this Pifelina. And it's not just the shape

546
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,840
of the head, but actually the shape of the brain is changed to be just like these other species.

547
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:59,040
And the distribution of the stem cells is changed. And again, no genetic change here. We didn't do

548
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:05,680
anything to alter the hardware. We altered the ability of this electrical network to remember

549
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:15,200
what the correct pattern is during regeneration. And the idea here is not just to make weird-looking

550
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,800
worms and frogs. There's a lot of biomedical implications to all of this, where we're looking

551
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:28,000
for optimal control of these kinds of outcomes in a way that doesn't require us to try to micromanage

552
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,920
gene expression and so on, which I don't think will be doable in our lifetime. So

553
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,920
there's applications here for cancer, obviously, both diagnostics and for normalization strategy,

554
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,200
so not chemotherapy, but normalization. And of course, for regeneration, using triggers to

555
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,720
regenerate complex organs such as limbs. And so in the last few minutes, I just want to show you

556
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:59,600
a step away from natural bodies to show you the real plasticity of cells and how remarkable this is.

557
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:07,600
So evolution provides standard animals with a set of instincts that operate in anatomical

558
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:12,640
morpho space. These are default outcomes. This is why acorns make oak trees and zebrafish

559
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:17,440
eggs make zebrafish, right? There's a default outcome. But much like in the nervous system,

560
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:24,080
there is a lot of reprogrammability here. And so we wanted to understand how much plasticity there is.

561
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,240
And so we wanted these new pattern memories. We wanted to see if they could form very rapidly,

562
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,880
and we want to understand where they come from. So this is the work of a staff scientist in my

563
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,000
group, Doug Blackiston. We have a collaboration through this new institute with Josh Bongard's lab

564
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,880
at the University of Vermont. And his student, Sam Kriegman, now a postdoc in my group.

565
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,240
And what they were doing is computational analysis of the following situation.

566
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:55,120
If you take cells and you liberate them from their normal environment, right, from the normal

567
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,200
set of instructive interactions that the other cells are telling them to do,

568
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,520
this larger network that has these bigger goals, would they reboot their multicellularity?

569
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,160
What would they do? Would they cooperate? And if so, what is it that they would build?

570
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:14,240
So we did this simple experiment. Here's a frog embryo. We take some skin cells off of the top

571
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,640
of this early embryo. So these are these are ectodermal cells. We dissociate them. And then we

572
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,720
put them in a little, in a little depression, you can, you can see that here. So basically,

573
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,040
we just dissociate them, and then we just pipet them down into this little hole. And so over the

574
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:31,920
next, over the next 24 hours, they will simply compact like this. Okay, you can see them,

575
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,400
they compact together, right? And then here, this is actually the flashing you see is actually

576
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,800
calcium signaling. It's some very interesting signaling dynamics, but they make this, this,

577
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,880
this round sort of thing. Now, they could have made lots of, they could have done lots of

578
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,360
different things. They could have crawled away from each other, they could have died,

579
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,960
they could have formed a monolayer, like you see in cell culture, could have done lots of things.

580
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,080
Instead, what they do is they form something we call a xenobot. Xenobot for Xenopus lavis,

581
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,880
that's the name of the frog, and it's a bio bot platform. So first of all, what you see here

582
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,720
is that they are self motile. So here it is swimming along, they have cilia the way the

583
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:10,400
reason they move is they have little, little hairs known as known as cilia that that they use to,

584
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:16,960
to, to, to row against, against the medium. And so, and so they, they, they swim along,

585
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,880
the cilia are normally used on the skin to, to move pathogens and mucus off of the, off of the

586
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,960
surface of the frog. And you can see here that, that they have all kinds of behaviors. This one

587
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,400
goes in the circle, this one sort of patrols back and forth, right? Here is some tracking data on

588
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,640
a group of them. This one's going on kind of a longer journey. This one is going in circles,

589
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:43,280
these two are interacting with each other. These skin cells normally are restricted to a very

590
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,240
boring two dimensional life sitting on the outside of a tackle by the rest, by the instructive

591
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:53,280
signals from the rest of the animal. When liberated from this, they, it turns out,

592
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,080
they have a completely different capacity to cooperate and make a new sort of little proto

593
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:03,840
animal. We didn't add anything, we didn't edit the genome, this is, we didn't induce, we didn't

594
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:10,400
put any, any trans genes, there are no nanomaterials. All we did was take something away. We took away

595
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,840
the restrictive instructive signals that the rest of the cells impose and we asked these

596
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,760
cells, what do they want to do? So now you're starting to see this, this, this multi-scale,

597
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,600
multi-scale competency architecture where the plasticities that, that I've been showing you

598
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,920
about being able to correct for all sorts of defects and so on is because all of the components

599
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,880
have their own agendas, which can be modified by the larger scale network that they're a part of,

600
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:40,560
but you can start to see this when, when some of those are lifted. Now here is, here it is in a

601
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:45,600
maze. This is filled with still water. So there's no water flow, it's completely closed. So you can

602
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:51,040
see it, it, it takes the corner without bumping into the edge. It then decides to turn around and

603
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:56,400
come back where it came from. Okay. So some sort of internal dynamic. So here it is, I'm swimming

604
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,120
along. It can, it can take this corner without having to bump into the opposite edge. So it

605
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:06,320
somehow knows that there's a possibility to take a corner here and then, and then it turns around.

606
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,000
We don't know why it turns around. They have all sorts of spontaneous behaviors, right, in this

607
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:16,080
system. They have the interesting capacity to regenerate themselves. So if you cut them in

608
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:20,320
half, this one was basically like pinched in half, you can see here over this 180 degree,

609
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:26,640
that hinge right there, right over that, that 180 degree, the forces, the forces must be, must be

610
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:32,160
really strong, but was able to do is able to try and fold itself back up into its new shape, into

611
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,960
its new xenobot shape. And if you actually pay attention to the calcium dynamics, you can see

612
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,120
it's very brain-like. They have, this is, you know, this is basically what, what calcium looks like

613
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:46,480
in, in, in brains. When you image living, living animals, there are no neurons here. This is just

614
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,760
skin. Everything that you've seen was just skin cells cooperating towards a new kind of morphology,

615
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:57,120
right? They have another very interesting behavior that we first saw. That's a kind of herding behavior

616
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:02,800
where they operate in groups like this and they, they, they do these kind of circular, these kind

617
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:09,040
of circular behaviors to make little piles. And, and why do they make little piles? Well, the most

618
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:15,920
amazing thing is that these little piles, if these little piles are themselves skin cells,

619
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,320
then what they will do is they will push them together into these little piles. Guess what the

620
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:25,520
little piles become? The little piles become the next generation of xenobots. So there's,

621
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,000
there's a couple of interesting things going on here. First of all,

622
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,240
this is a kind of replication. It's not a real lineage. They don't have strong heredity yet,

623
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:41,760
but it's a kind of replication because given components in the environment, they will make copies

624
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,720
of themselves. This is much closer to Von Neumann's idea of reproducing machines than to the way that

625
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,320
any other organism reproduces, right? So they will, they will go around, they will make, you know,

626
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,000
multiple generations of these little balls and the little balls become xenobots and continue the

627
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:00,160
cycle and keep doing it again and again. One interesting thing is that what's happened here

628
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,600
is that when we made it impossible for these cells to reproduce in their normal fashion,

629
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:12,560
within 48 hours, they have found a new way to pretty much do the same thing that has never

630
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,960
existed, as to our knowledge, never existed in evolution. No other, no other animal does this.

631
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:22,320
And so this is an amazing example, I think, an amazing example of problem solving and

632
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:27,120
plasticity. When you can't do things the original way, you can repurpose your existing hardware

633
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:33,360
to swim around to, and then to undergo behaviors that will actually do things that you can't do

634
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:38,800
the normal way. That's the first thing. The second thing to note here is that when we made these

635
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:44,400
xenobots, we, it was very much a collaboration between us and the cells themselves. We don't

636
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:51,680
know how to tell cells to assume a particular shape yet. All we were able to do was to remove some

637
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,600
constraints and put them in the new environment. The cells did all the rest after that, all the

638
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,840
heavy lifting. And we, and this is, this is very important because it's a new kind of

639
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:05,920
robotics and engineering where your material is not passive. It is not active. It's more than that.

640
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,720
It's an agential material, right? The new, I think the future of bioengineering is,

641
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:16,400
of engineering in general, is working with parts that are themselves some sort of simple,

642
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,320
or maybe not so simple, homeostatic agent. So that what you're doing is you're not engineering

643
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:24,320
the way we normally engineer. You micromanage every part. You have to know how to do everything.

644
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:32,320
You are actually signaling to, you know, you're trying to shift the way that your parts are

645
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:36,080
going to behave because they have their own behavior. And evolution does exactly that.

646
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:40,400
When these, when these bots make the next generation of bots, this only works because

647
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,800
the material they are working with, the cells that they are working with is itself an agential

648
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,400
material and is going to do the same things on its own. That's the only reason this works.

649
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:53,120
And that's, and the same is true of evolution. When you, when you try to change an organism,

650
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:59,120
you have to motivate and affect its guided self-assembly, the cells that you're working with.

651
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:03,360
They have their own, they have their own agendas. And so when you see these Xenobots,

652
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:07,760
they have a normal frog genome. And these Xenobots don't have a straightforward evolutionary

653
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:13,040
backstory. If you ask, why do Xenobots have a particular behavior and structure, the answer

654
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,880
is not because for millions of years they were selected to be good Xenobots. There's never

655
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:22,000
been any Xenobots. So the cells themselves were part of the evolutionary stream on Earth,

656
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,640
but they were selected for a completely different set of functions. So we really need to understand

657
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:32,640
how it is that evolution doesn't make, it doesn't find solutions to specific problems. It finds

658
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:37,760
machines that solve problems in novel ways. Right. So here's the, here's the unique developmental

659
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,000
sequence of a Xenobot. This is what normal frogs do. They are, they look like this and they look

660
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,080
like that. Then they run around like this. This is what Xenobots do. They make a, they make a body

661
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:50,560
like this. Eventually they will transition in, you know, two months later, they transition into

662
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:54,160
something that looks like that. Where does that come from? That's never existed before

663
01:01:54,160 --> 01:02:01,440
during evolution. So just to close up, here's, here's the, the, the summary of what I tried to

664
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:08,160
say is that there is a framework which is really focused on a continuum of agency, not binary

665
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:15,440
categories. It's very engineering focused in terms of finding the best most appropriate models

666
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:22,160
for, to explain the scaling of, of cognition. The materials don't matter. There is no privileged

667
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:28,160
substrate. One useful way to think about systems is as the scale of goals that they are capable of,

668
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,680
of, of pursuing, we can think of intelligence as problem solving and abstract spaces.

669
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:39,200
And developmental bio electricity is a great way to start to look at how competent individuals

670
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,520
can scale their goals. And I think that's exactly what, what evolution did. And we can certainly

671
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:49,360
do that. Evolution is hugely potentiated, sped up by this kind of multi-scale competency

672
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:53,840
architecture. And the biggest, to me, one of the biggest questions going forward is,

673
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:58,480
where do these goals come from? It's not going to be selection. Where else can they come from?

674
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:04,640
And I just want to remind people that now with the new technologies, everything that every, every

675
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,640
organism you've ever heard of, right? Everything that Darwin meant when he said, endless forms,

676
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:14,720
most beautiful, all of that is a tiny little corner of this incredibly large state space of,

677
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:21,440
of cyborgs and hybrids and, and chimeras and all, all possible combinations of evolved material,

678
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:28,000
engineered material and artificial intelligence. And we're going to have to be able to relate in

679
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,800
some way to these things when we're not able to say what it is and what it's capable of based

680
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:37,440
on what it looks like and where it came from. So lots of, lots of papers on all these things.

681
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:44,080
I'm happy to send, send things out. These are the, the people that did all of the, the hard work

682
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:48,800
of the things that I showed you today. So I thank them. I thank our collaborators, our funders,

683
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:54,240
of course, and the model systems, which, which always do the heavy lifting. And I will stop here

684
01:03:54,320 --> 01:04:04,080
and thank you. Okay.

685
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:21,120
Can you hear us, Michael? Yeah, yeah, okay. Well, amazing talk. What can I say? I'm, I'm really,

686
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:26,960
really impressed. I knew some of your research personally, but now that I see more, I want to

687
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:35,120
know more. Very, very nice attractor of topics. What we start with the question round. Anybody

688
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:46,480
has questions, comments? Yeah, Francis. Well, I think what this illustrates is that agency

689
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:53,920
is something very primitive in life. And agency is not just adaptation, as you say, to very specific

690
01:04:53,920 --> 01:05:01,760
selective pressures, but it's adaptation to a wide range of things. So it's the plasticity,

691
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:08,000
it's the flexibility, it's the adaptivity that has been selected. So I assume that these cells

692
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,200
have some general agential behaviors, which adapt to the circumstances and when the circumstances

693
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:19,680
are very different, like in the case of these Xenobots, I assume there is still enough agency

694
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:25,520
left that they can do things that look kind of intelligent, even though they are completely

695
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:33,120
different from what they normally do. So it reinforces a little bit my proposal in my talk

696
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:38,400
that I said that the first step is of the salt maintenance. It's a zillions where zillions means

697
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:44,320
expanding your basin of attraction, it means expanding the space in which you can solve problems.

698
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:49,600
So what these things probably have learned a valuable time ago before they were folks,

699
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:55,360
is to expand this space for problems they could solve so that now if you take them out of their

700
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:59,920
normal space where they are in the folks body, they can still do things in this completely

701
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:05,200
different space because they have most this kind of generic agency you might want.

702
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:13,200
Yeah, I think that's absolutely correct. Of course, one of the big mysteries that we

703
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:19,920
now have to address, and we're doing this in computational models and at the bench,

704
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:27,840
is to really understand how evolution is able to produce this because the standard story is

705
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:35,120
that evolution is supposed to always pick the immediate short-term benefit and how it is that

706
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:42,240
it maximizes this incredible ability to problem solve instead of a very hard wire, and certainly

707
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,920
there are animals that act hardwired in various ways, you know, C. elegans and things like that,

708
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:52,640
but the majority are exactly as you just said, and so how that arises from evolutionary dynamics

709
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:59,040
that we're always told are very kind of short-sighted and always taking the immediate benefit,

710
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:03,120
it's not clear and that represents a huge area for research.

711
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:08,880
Well, my hypothesis is that when we think about evolution, we're thinking about

712
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,920
organisms that are already very highly specialized and then they are already so well

713
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,720
optimized for certain things that they can't afford to take risks to make too many changes,

714
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,720
but if you think about the origin of life and you think about all the catalytic systems

715
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:29,120
where there are all kinds of molecules coming and going and temperatures changing and water

716
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:36,000
entering and drying out, these very first thoughts, they had to be extremely non-specialized,

717
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:42,960
they had to be extremely resilient, they had to be extremely adaptive and probably these properties

718
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:48,800
are just properties that define life to have to get to the first living cells, you had to have this

719
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:55,600
extreme adaptivity and then once you had this more specialized organism, you didn't need

720
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:59,920
all these functions anymore, but they are still there because they can be the essence of life.

721
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:17,520
More comments, questions? No? Well, I have a little question here, this hand has a little question.

722
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,280
Oh, it's frozen even better.

723
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:36,000
So, as I understand, you are using the electrical field on the cell,

724
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:43,280
or what electrical what is the voltage, you measure the voltages, but what would be like the

725
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:53,120
real object that is being measured there? Yeah, what we're measuring is the voltage difference

726
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:57,680
between the inside and the outside of the cell, so every cell has a membrane and there's an

727
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:02,960
electrical potential between zero and let's say 80 millivolts, that's between the inside and the

728
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:09,520
outside, so what we're looking at is if you think about a neural network or an artificial neural

729
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:16,720
network where every node has an activation level, and so what we're looking at is the electrical

730
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:23,840
state of every individual cell, but that's not actually where the information is, the information

731
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:31,120
is in the flow of electrical computations through the whole network, so what we're measuring is the

732
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:37,920
spatial pattern and then over time we would take videos of each individual activation weight, it's

733
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:46,080
exactly like neuroscience except that the time is greatly slowed down, so you can take almost

734
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:50,960
any neuroscience paper and just do a fine to replace and Microsoft Word replace the words

735
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:56,080
neuron with the word cell, replace millisecond with hour and everything else basically works,

736
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:03,280
it's the same kind of thing. Yeah, so these patterns that are across multiple cells then

737
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:08,720
it's not the, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no that's critical, that's critical, it's not individual cells, yeah.

738
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:16,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so okay, so yeah, yeah, okay, and I have, sorry, sorry, did it,

739
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:22,960
when, yeah, yeah, but continue first. It's the, it's the, it's where I'm getting to the question, so,

740
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:32,080
so you are using now, there is this genetic information that is kind of like the hardware

741
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:37,920
you were mentioning, then you have the electrical field which is the electrical component which

742
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:44,880
encodes an extra mechanism which has been kind of like overlooked by evolutionary morphogenesis or

743
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:53,280
like by the fields you were mentioning and then I wonder, like this is, my wonder is like

744
01:10:53,680 --> 01:11:01,440
might there be other forces at play? Have you have, have you studied or measured or why would

745
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:08,560
have to be only electrical? So, so that's the, since there are many other physical quantities

746
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:15,120
that might have similar dynamics and play a role in transmission and so on. Sure, sure, sure,

747
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:19,760
there, there are many others and many people study them, there's biomechanical forces,

748
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,480
there is ultra-weak photon emission, there are of course chemical gradients that everybody

749
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:29,840
studies, all of these exist. My claim is not that they're not important or that bioelectricity

750
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:35,600
does everything, no, but, but bioelectricity is where the only data that I know of has been

751
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:41,840
obtained where those bioelectrical dynamics are actually the memory medium of this collective

752
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,840
intelligence. It's possible that, you know, 10 years from now somebody will find out that the

753
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,240
biomechanical stress patterns are also storing the same thing, entirely possible, but it hasn't

754
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:54,560
been done. The only, you know, these other, these other forces have been treated as,

755
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:01,120
as pieces of physics at the lowest level that need to be tracked to, to understand the system

756
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:05,520
and their bioelectricity is exactly like all these others, but what we have shown, I think,

757
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:12,640
is that bioelectricity has a really important role as the, as the, as the actual medium of the

758
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,200
computation. So it's like, you know, you can look at a computer and okay, yep, there are stress

759
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:23,200
forces, there are vibrations, there are, you know, heat gradients, all kinds of things going on, but

760
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:28,880
if you want to really understand what computations they're doing, the bioelectric, the, you know,

761
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:35,520
the electric patterns through the circuits have a privileged status and maybe these other modalities

762
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:40,160
will have the same thing. It's entirely possible, maybe evolution uses them all, but it's, but it's

763
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:45,280
not known. It's only known at this point for the bioelectrics. Yeah, yeah, that was my, my question.

764
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:53,680
Please do it. Yeah, very amazing talk, first of all, and I knew your work already, so, but okay,

765
01:12:53,680 --> 01:13:01,600
it was nice to see all these little details explained carefully. No, I, I, I'm a counter

766
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:09,920
physicist. So electricity is, is thought over. So in a certain way, I wonder actually,

767
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:17,200
certainly because you have this memory effect. So there is something new being revealed here,

768
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:25,280
I think, that has not been really identified. And that is difficult to, to explain out of Darwinian

769
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:31,360
evolution, even in, in, in an easy way at least in a straightforward way. Well, that's also the

770
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:40,960
message which was a little bit in your talk, I think. So I wonder whether, because it would be too

771
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:46,560
long to, to, to tell you the details now, but I could send you some, some, some material there. But

772
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:51,760
let's say we are working on, on an integration of quantum physics where this would fit in in some

773
01:13:51,760 --> 01:14:00,160
way, you see, that would be things happening on the quantum level in, in, in, in, in photon clouds,

774
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:10,480
which, which, which were not, which not have been revealed yet, yet clearly that have to do with,

775
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:19,520
with meaning, meaning that would be stored in, in, in light in some way. And so, so it's amazing,

776
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:24,320
it's amazing, these experiments. Thank you. I knew them already. So it was not the first time that

777
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:30,880
I saw them. But let's say that. Yeah. Yeah, I'd be very happy to, yeah, please send me, yeah, send

778
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:36,160
me, send me what you have. I will send you an email because this would take too long to make

779
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:42,880
my own explanation. Exactly the kind of things that we want to, want to happen, that we connect

780
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:49,440
with each other and also the online audience can also bring, bring connections. And why not keep,

781
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:54,800
keep discussing. I'm totally interested in this. And I know some people who will be interested too.

782
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:01,040
So I'm kind of new to the topic, but it's extremely, extremely interesting as for me as well. Please,

783
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:07,040
Francis. Another thing that I find very interesting in your work I had heard about it is before this

784
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:12,880
idea of the cognitive boundary, where you use the metaphor of the light cone, but I'm not sure

785
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:19,280
that's a very good metaphor because the light kind of extends in this way while yours comes together

786
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:25,760
so maybe more something like a cognitive horizon, I would say the horizon is as far as you can see.

787
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:31,120
And I personally have been using the concept already for years of prospect, the prospect is

788
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:37,200
what you can see ahead of you and what you can imagine to be good or bad. So prospect is both

789
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:44,640
an anticipation and a notion of good or bad or value. The prospect is the things you see

790
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:50,320
potentially that you may go to or that you may want to avoid. And I think your notion of cognitive

791
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:55,760
bond is very similar to my notion of prospect. And indeed, the term in evolution, you might say,

792
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:02,400
is to extant the prospect because the larger the prospect, the easier it becomes to find something

793
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:08,480
valuable to go towards a goal that is worthwhile and the easier it also becomes to see the potential

794
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:17,360
dangers and to avoid them. So I just heard a commentary about Théâtre de Chardin, who had

795
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:23,040
a kind of a mystical philosophy, but he had very good intuitions. He had this law of complexity

796
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:28,240
consciousness where he says during evolution, complexity and consciousness increase at the

797
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:32,640
same time. And this notion of consciousness was a little bit like this notion of the cognitive

798
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:39,520
boundary. As evolution progresses, the systems can see farther and can see wider around them.

799
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:45,680
And that comes with the idea of the north here, by the internet. Now we can all in a sense see

800
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:51,200
what's happening all around the world. So it's this extension of the cognitive boundary. I think

801
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,880
all what I call prospect, I think that's a very important idea.

802
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:03,600
Yeah, I agree. Can I say something? Can you hear me? I can hear you. Yeah. Yeah. Great.

803
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:12,160
Thank you very much. Yes, for this amazing talk. I just want to make a make a make a notion in

804
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:19,920
terms of interdisciplinarity. Because what you said, I find super interesting and super

805
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:26,640
amazing where where is the shape defined or located in the first place? This is the one

806
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:34,560
question you put in the the other one was how does it the system knows when it is right,

807
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:39,920
the the the forming of the shape and these two questions are exactly the crucial crucial

808
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:45,680
questions in in design in the in the artistic process. So this did really strike me when you

809
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:50,880
were saying this. So where are these and is it possible to find these set points?

810
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:57,680
And so I think this this this this happens on on on on many different levels. These I think these

811
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:05,360
are two very, very deep and important questions. This is just what I want to to to say. Yeah.

812
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,880
Really, thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah, I took a bunch of notes during your talk. So I will

813
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:15,760
be I will be emailing you afterwards. I completely agree. There are some nice nice similarities

814
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:25,840
here. Yeah, great. Thank you. Okay, amazing. Then we will take a little break and have some coffee

815
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:32,240
on this side of the of the universe. And then we'll see you back for our last talk, where

816
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:39,920
Maximiliano Sanin will tell us about transport networks and why they modeling is the wrong way.

817
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:46,320
So I will stop the recording now and then stop the call so the videos can be

818
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:53,600
generated. So see you in nearly 15 minutes. Okay, thank you guys. Until soon. Thanks, Michael.
