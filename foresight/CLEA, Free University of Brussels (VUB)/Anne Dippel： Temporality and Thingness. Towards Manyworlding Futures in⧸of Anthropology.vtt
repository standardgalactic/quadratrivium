WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
So Anne, the floor is yours.

00:03.560 --> 00:05.100
We already see your slides.

00:05.100 --> 00:10.100
So put the spotlight on the floor, welcome.

00:13.140 --> 00:14.480
Yeah, thank you very much.

00:15.560 --> 00:19.240
Before I start my talk and dive into,

00:19.240 --> 00:21.320
I just would like to know

00:21.320 --> 00:25.080
what your personal academic background is.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.640
So you do not have to talk too much,

00:27.680 --> 00:31.200
just everybody who's from the STEM field

00:31.200 --> 00:34.760
should please raise her or his or their arms

00:34.760 --> 00:37.760
so that I know whether anybody, okay.

00:37.760 --> 00:41.040
So we have one STEM person, two STEM persons,

00:41.040 --> 00:45.040
three STEM persons, four STEM persons, thank you very much.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.000
And is there anybody of the humanities

00:47.000 --> 00:51.760
and social science background of philosophy also?

00:51.760 --> 00:53.880
Okay, wonderful, okay.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.200
So since there are more people who are

00:56.200 --> 00:59.360
in the STEM background than not,

00:59.360 --> 01:02.440
I will just briefly give in two sentences,

01:02.440 --> 01:05.480
I try to let you know what we are actually doing

01:05.480 --> 01:10.040
as anthropologists because as I once met a very old physicist

01:10.040 --> 01:13.320
who still has been raised in the tradition of

01:13.320 --> 01:15.560
Werner Heisenbach and others,

01:15.560 --> 01:17.840
many people think anthropology is something

01:17.840 --> 01:19.880
that everybody can do,

01:19.880 --> 01:23.360
but actually anthropology is involving also

01:23.360 --> 01:25.200
a huge set of methodology

01:25.200 --> 01:30.200
and is a year-long training of doing fieldwork amongst people.

01:30.560 --> 01:33.960
And some people do fieldwork in foreign cultures

01:33.960 --> 01:37.560
to themselves, other do fieldwork within their home cultures.

01:37.560 --> 01:41.320
And the third people do a fieldwork in knowledge cultures.

01:41.320 --> 01:44.560
And I'm an anthropologist of physics and computer science.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.480
That means that I'm actually living with

01:47.480 --> 01:49.400
and have been living with physicists

01:49.400 --> 01:53.000
and computer scientists for the past eight years.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.040
And I'm really diving into their world.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.960
I'm learning their language.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.360
I'm experiencing what they experience

01:59.360 --> 02:02.240
and experience is also the most central term

02:02.240 --> 02:04.760
of what we're doing as anthropologists.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.560
That means that we already know very much

02:07.560 --> 02:12.480
that what we see is biased by our own observations

02:12.480 --> 02:14.760
and that of course everything we observed

02:14.760 --> 02:17.080
within the real world can be just described

02:17.080 --> 02:20.240
as approximation by ourselves.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.400
So when we do fieldwork,

02:21.400 --> 02:24.080
we have developed over the past 150 years,

02:24.080 --> 02:27.080
a toolset that allows us to differentiate

02:27.080 --> 02:29.800
what is our own perceptual bias.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.880
And on the other hand, what we can see in the field

02:31.880 --> 02:34.440
and where we actually invent the field.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.600
And that's very much important

02:35.600 --> 02:38.800
because there's very often, especially from the STEM field,

02:38.800 --> 02:41.480
the question when we're not working with numbers

02:41.480 --> 02:44.040
and we stop working with statistics predominantly,

02:44.040 --> 02:46.600
we have been and do work with statistics.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.440
We call that mixed methods,

02:48.440 --> 02:51.240
but we predominantly work with interviews,

02:51.240 --> 02:53.640
with language, with listening to the people.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.880
With actually experiencing their lives.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.800
And anthropologists, therefore, is a training

02:59.800 --> 03:02.640
and since we are time-bound human deadly beings,

03:02.640 --> 03:05.840
it takes time to become an anthropologist.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.200
So that's what we actually do.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.560
And that allows us to live with the people

03:10.560 --> 03:13.360
and to understand what's their concern.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.480
And what I'm going to do today with you

03:15.480 --> 03:18.040
is to tell you out of my research

03:18.040 --> 03:19.480
that I did in the last years

03:20.760 --> 03:22.880
and dive into the question of future.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.600
And I think that's very much of importance,

03:24.600 --> 03:25.840
especially when you work with

03:25.840 --> 03:27.640
within the field of quantum mechanics,

03:27.640 --> 03:30.320
artificial intelligence and so on and so on,

03:30.320 --> 03:33.360
because these fields are really shaping the digital era

03:33.360 --> 03:35.280
and transforming the whole world

03:35.280 --> 03:37.200
and the whole communities we're living in.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.640
And that's something that's rather my turf.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.880
So I'm looking very much forward also

03:42.880 --> 03:47.560
to the discussions that we have and we will have.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.840
In the last years, I have been, for example,

03:49.840 --> 03:53.040
publishing last year, came out a book first in German,

03:53.040 --> 03:54.320
The Translations in Process,

03:54.320 --> 03:57.520
where I did an ethnography of the computer simulation

03:57.520 --> 04:00.040
of the quantum mechanical double slit experiment

04:00.040 --> 04:02.720
in a single event-based computer simulation

04:02.720 --> 04:05.000
at the research center in Jülich

04:05.000 --> 04:08.040
and compared it with the quantum mechanical double slit

04:08.040 --> 04:11.560
experiments conducted in Vienna today.

04:11.560 --> 04:14.560
And came out with a comparison, actually,

04:14.560 --> 04:17.040
but about the Schrödinger equation on the one hand

04:17.040 --> 04:19.160
and on the other hand, computer simulation.

04:19.160 --> 04:22.240
So different forms of approximating reality

04:22.240 --> 04:25.360
on the one hand based on first principles in mathematics,

04:25.360 --> 04:29.120
on the other hand based on the approximation to truth

04:29.120 --> 04:31.920
by a single event computer simulation.

04:31.920 --> 04:35.920
And these produce different forms of reality

04:35.920 --> 04:37.240
or interpretations of reality,

04:37.240 --> 04:39.760
which doesn't mean that there isn't any truth anymore,

04:39.760 --> 04:41.160
but the problem of course is,

04:41.160 --> 04:44.280
and you're more aware than I am that with simulation,

04:44.280 --> 04:47.600
you can actually show everything that you want to

04:47.600 --> 04:52.360
and then everything that could be considered as reality

04:52.360 --> 04:56.880
can be put into equality with what is actually

04:56.880 --> 04:58.920
the real reality itself.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.480
And that was quite a challenge and also a lot of fun

05:01.480 --> 05:05.960
because quantum mechanics is something that is posing

05:05.960 --> 05:07.960
all these questions and shattering

05:07.960 --> 05:11.100
the understanding of nature more than anything else.

05:12.160 --> 05:15.000
Something that wasn't so bizarre to us as anthropologists

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
because for us, the world is itself always either or,

05:20.280 --> 05:22.360
and not neither or, but neither nor

05:22.360 --> 05:24.680
and has these kinds of entanglements.

05:24.680 --> 05:27.600
So what we found out in the last years

05:27.600 --> 05:30.480
resonates very well with what quantum mechanics

05:30.480 --> 05:32.840
and other disciplines found out.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.800
And in the last years also I dealt a lot

05:34.800 --> 05:37.120
with anthropology of play and games,

05:37.120 --> 05:39.760
with the interrelations of facts and fictions

05:39.760 --> 05:41.840
and how cosmologies are made

05:41.840 --> 05:45.180
and what role science has these days

05:45.180 --> 05:50.180
where fictions are shattering the world of fact-making.

05:53.800 --> 05:58.720
In the next 45 minutes, so I will first of all

05:58.720 --> 06:00.720
bring you onto a journey

06:00.720 --> 06:04.000
and in the field of humanities and social sciences

06:04.000 --> 06:05.520
where I'm classically trained,

06:05.520 --> 06:08.460
we very often read written texts.

06:08.460 --> 06:12.500
We are text-based and written hermeneutical disciplines.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.900
We love writing and so please lay back

06:15.900 --> 06:20.900
and bear that it was important to me to write down for you

06:21.500 --> 06:24.900
and what I have been saying because it mattered so much

06:24.900 --> 06:26.580
to me what I wanted to tell you

06:26.580 --> 06:29.820
that I tried to put it into my rusty German English

06:29.820 --> 06:33.860
because more I'm not able to do than rusty German English.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.580
And in this journey, I will first tell you

06:36.620 --> 06:38.540
how I actually ended up at CERN,

06:38.540 --> 06:40.620
how I came to this field work that I did

06:40.620 --> 06:42.300
and that I'm going to present you.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.940
And then I will dive into the question of uncertainty

06:44.940 --> 06:49.940
that stem scientists encounter on all levels.

06:50.220 --> 06:53.260
And what we actually as anthropologists can see

06:53.260 --> 06:57.860
and observe how rhythms of mechanical technology

06:57.860 --> 07:01.580
and algorithmic and also human uncertainty

07:01.580 --> 07:03.740
are going into an interplay

07:03.740 --> 07:05.860
which transform each individual

07:05.860 --> 07:07.960
that is doing actually science

07:07.960 --> 07:10.460
within an experimental field

07:11.580 --> 07:13.340
turns it from an individual

07:13.340 --> 07:15.580
into something that I call intravisual

07:15.580 --> 07:17.380
and how I'm coming to that point

07:17.380 --> 07:19.860
and to describe how this collaboration

07:19.860 --> 07:22.500
of different people doing field work

07:22.500 --> 07:26.340
turning from individuals in entanglement with others

07:26.340 --> 07:28.740
to intravisuals to actually produce science

07:28.740 --> 07:30.060
and to make things happen.

07:30.060 --> 07:32.260
That's something I wanna take you onto a journey with

07:32.260 --> 07:33.380
in the next minutes.

07:35.100 --> 07:38.060
So far, any questions from your side?

07:40.820 --> 07:41.940
Wonderful.

07:41.940 --> 07:46.940
So, field work is a form of memoir making.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.620
Reminds us anthropologist Ruth Behr.

07:50.820 --> 07:54.100
From that perspective, it is a cultural fact-making

07:54.100 --> 07:56.480
of a future yet to come.

07:57.380 --> 07:59.580
Maybe that explains why anthropologists

07:59.580 --> 08:02.940
did not focus on future as a cultural fact

08:02.940 --> 08:06.300
until Arjun Apadurai reminded the discipline.

08:06.300 --> 08:10.020
We were blinded by our own deformation professionel

08:10.020 --> 08:13.300
by the obvious movement of our own way of knowledge production

08:13.300 --> 08:15.980
with field notes and recorded interviews

08:15.980 --> 08:18.260
and tempted by collective interests

08:18.260 --> 08:20.580
and individuals need to know where we

08:20.580 --> 08:22.540
or they are coming from.

08:22.540 --> 08:24.180
Because as already in Odysseys,

08:24.180 --> 08:26.020
people want to know where they're living

08:26.020 --> 08:27.540
and where they're coming from.

08:27.580 --> 08:29.580
But since the future is uncertain,

08:29.580 --> 08:32.860
that's something we do not actually investigate so much with

08:32.860 --> 08:35.100
because we are not fortune tellers.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.180
But it becomes more and more important

08:37.180 --> 08:38.700
in a time of computer simulation

08:38.700 --> 08:40.940
where you actually have to foresee and you can

08:40.940 --> 08:44.220
and you have tools to foresee and estimate futures

08:44.220 --> 08:46.340
quite precisely.

08:46.340 --> 08:48.540
And that is where anthropology becomes interesting

08:48.540 --> 08:50.980
when you think about the future

08:50.980 --> 08:52.500
and how the future is made.

08:53.580 --> 08:56.780
A long time ago, anthropology was a space bound

08:56.780 --> 08:59.740
and historiography a time bound discipline.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.940
Anthropology deals with futures and realities

09:02.940 --> 09:05.020
and what is happening in the now.

09:05.020 --> 09:08.340
And historiography is looking into the past.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.580
The first anthropology mistrusted by design

09:11.580 --> 09:14.180
how the past is made through archival sources

09:14.180 --> 09:16.620
because who chooses what is going into the archives?

09:16.620 --> 09:18.740
Who chooses the truth of the past?

09:18.740 --> 09:21.380
Why the latter, historiography,

09:21.380 --> 09:24.660
mistrusted any investigations of the contemporary

09:24.700 --> 09:28.620
as already the philosopher Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel summed it up,

09:28.620 --> 09:31.580
the flight of my nervous old is blind in the now.

09:31.580 --> 09:33.020
We cannot understand the now

09:33.020 --> 09:35.860
because we are part of the present.

09:35.860 --> 09:38.660
And it was this Hegel's challenge encountered

09:38.660 --> 09:40.700
by the ethnographers attempt to understand

09:40.700 --> 09:43.580
what is going on right now that turned me

09:43.580 --> 09:47.220
into an anthropologist from historiography coming.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.700
And it is this challenge that drives me from now on

09:49.700 --> 09:51.860
to the days that are coming.

09:51.860 --> 09:53.660
I always was drawn to understand

09:53.660 --> 09:55.780
what humans make out of this being in

09:55.780 --> 09:58.300
and beyond space, time and matter.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.060
And that is what I will talk about.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.100
In the following minutes, I want to contribute

10:03.100 --> 10:06.580
to the question how different futures are being practiced,

10:06.580 --> 10:11.140
narrated, placed and made tangible in everyday life worlds.

10:11.140 --> 10:14.420
I'm doing so by reflecting upon ethnographic insights.

10:14.420 --> 10:16.540
I gathered over the past eight years

10:16.540 --> 10:19.380
in the falling empire that discursively

10:19.380 --> 10:21.580
and technically reigned what Karen Barat,

10:21.580 --> 10:24.340
a philosopher and physicist called, I quote,

10:24.340 --> 10:27.660
imperialism of universal space and time.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.180
I'm talking about physics

10:29.180 --> 10:32.580
and to be more precise, high energy physics.

10:32.580 --> 10:35.260
Why I consider this a falling empire

10:35.260 --> 10:38.380
and not a reigning empire we can talk about later.

10:38.380 --> 10:40.660
I'm very curious about it.

10:40.660 --> 10:43.820
And I'm also taking up the challenge to discuss this.

10:45.180 --> 10:48.540
I'm telling tales how physicists deal with resistances

10:48.540 --> 10:51.980
of materiality and masculinity.

10:51.980 --> 10:54.220
I'm not aiming to explain to you again

10:54.220 --> 10:56.740
the cosmology and technologies of physics

10:56.740 --> 11:00.060
with the help of feminist science and technology studies

11:00.060 --> 11:02.940
or to retell you how physicists do their job.

11:02.940 --> 11:04.260
I did this elsewhere.

11:04.260 --> 11:06.100
And I think there are enough people in this room

11:06.100 --> 11:09.300
who know much better and more about this than I do.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.380
And others actually did this already,

11:11.380 --> 11:14.140
like Sharon Trawig, Karen Knott-Cetina

11:14.140 --> 11:17.580
or the Belgian philosopher Isabel Stengers.

11:17.580 --> 11:19.420
Rather, I try to give an account

11:19.420 --> 11:21.740
out of one of the centers of the ruined

11:21.740 --> 11:23.780
and ruinous places of Europe,

11:23.780 --> 11:27.020
this de-centered and misplaced territory of Gaia

11:27.020 --> 11:29.900
as Pernullatou and others would call it.

11:29.900 --> 11:34.220
It is an account of how people deal with uncertainty

11:34.220 --> 11:38.100
out of concern and care for what they love most,

11:38.100 --> 11:42.140
which is in this case, an experimental system of physics.

11:43.180 --> 11:46.180
I'm looking for what is a wondrous future to them,

11:46.180 --> 11:49.140
which is to understand what constitutes our cosmos,

11:49.140 --> 11:51.700
I quote, from a physical point of view

11:51.700 --> 11:54.580
and collaborate in a common universal enterprise

11:54.580 --> 11:59.260
that includes everything and excludes exclusivity in the end.

12:00.460 --> 12:03.260
My ethnography is the account of a most cis,

12:03.260 --> 12:06.340
hetero and male white dominant field.

12:06.340 --> 12:08.740
Its origins of organization and community

12:08.740 --> 12:11.620
are dating back to war, to the Second World War,

12:11.620 --> 12:15.060
the atom bomb plus alamos, physics people did learn

12:15.060 --> 12:18.740
to love the bomb when it just existed as a vague plan.

12:18.740 --> 12:20.460
In fact, they made it up.

12:21.540 --> 12:24.460
These people are Stanley Kubrick's blueprints

12:24.460 --> 12:26.420
and they are not.

12:26.420 --> 12:29.020
For where is normativity and power,

12:29.020 --> 12:31.940
there is resistance and subversion also

12:31.940 --> 12:34.220
and foremost amongst physicists.

12:35.300 --> 12:38.780
And even physicists' identities aren't either all

12:38.780 --> 12:42.300
or especially physicists' identities aren't dualist,

12:42.300 --> 12:44.860
but carefully monitored and risk-managed.

12:44.860 --> 12:49.820
Yes, these guys, as even women in the field often call themselves,

12:49.820 --> 12:52.340
are separating nature and culture.

12:52.340 --> 12:55.860
Yes, they seem to be hopeless platonics,

12:55.860 --> 12:58.780
believing and proving mathematics idealism

12:58.780 --> 13:02.500
and helpless Aristotelians observing and measuring nature,

13:02.500 --> 13:04.620
making up categories and models.

13:05.500 --> 13:09.820
They mistrust their data and falsify hypothesis.

13:09.820 --> 13:12.740
They pushed ethics into another department,

13:12.740 --> 13:16.140
but didn't we as anthropologists in Germany too,

13:16.140 --> 13:18.460
when we decided not to be a political discipline

13:18.460 --> 13:20.220
after the Second World War,

13:20.220 --> 13:23.620
and what we are actually doing is transforming again

13:23.620 --> 13:25.460
into a political discipline.

13:25.460 --> 13:26.900
And that's very fascinating,

13:26.900 --> 13:29.140
but from a decolonial perspective,

13:29.140 --> 13:32.340
in times of identity crisis of Europe all over Europe.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.580
You see, I will be talking from a West German

13:36.580 --> 13:39.460
wide middle upper class perspective,

13:39.460 --> 13:42.420
not of my choice, but of discursive attribution.

13:43.340 --> 13:46.460
I like to see from any other point of view,

13:46.460 --> 13:48.420
but I come from these privileged worlds

13:48.420 --> 13:50.380
and thus unlearn every day to look

13:50.380 --> 13:52.700
and loosen up conceptions I grew up with.

13:53.780 --> 13:56.740
Thus, addicts met us to me on many levels

13:56.740 --> 14:00.300
and rethinking the world from this ruined and ruinous place

14:00.300 --> 14:03.460
employed by the university of Jena

14:03.460 --> 14:06.100
that granted Karl Marx his PhD

14:06.100 --> 14:09.440
and allowed Hegel to write his phenomenology of perception,

14:09.440 --> 14:12.800
just pushes me to understand local specificities

14:12.800 --> 14:14.760
and global peculiarities

14:14.760 --> 14:17.680
in ever more solidarity-needing world

14:17.680 --> 14:19.960
that craves for togetherness

14:19.960 --> 14:22.520
and a sense of Guyon community,

14:22.520 --> 14:26.520
but fragments in small communities of indigenities

14:26.520 --> 14:29.160
that lose the big picture on the one hand,

14:29.160 --> 14:31.200
and in the meantime on the other,

14:31.200 --> 14:33.400
Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos battle

14:33.400 --> 14:35.200
for the shuttle service to the moon.

14:35.200 --> 14:39.840
Whatever we learned, no matter what we see,

14:39.840 --> 14:43.240
intraactions, and I'm deploying here the term of Karen Barat

14:43.240 --> 14:44.560
that she developed

14:44.560 --> 14:47.760
out of the Copenhagen interpretation of Nils Bohr,

14:47.760 --> 14:49.640
intraactions of realities,

14:49.640 --> 14:53.800
that means phenomena are emerging out of the interaction

14:53.800 --> 14:57.520
within the moment and aren't pre-disposed.

14:57.520 --> 14:58.920
Interactions of realities

14:58.920 --> 15:02.680
build the fundament of our disciplinary insights.

15:02.680 --> 15:05.600
Experiences are not human-made alone.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.640
And chance, as we all patients,

15:07.640 --> 15:10.280
as well as patients, are our most important assets

15:10.280 --> 15:14.320
for doing a good analysis of our own empirical insight.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.160
That's right.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.560
Yeah?

15:17.560 --> 15:19.560
They're not based on the truth.

15:21.400 --> 15:22.320
Excuse me.

15:25.680 --> 15:26.800
Should I continue?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Just for the...

15:33.680 --> 15:35.000
Are you still there?

15:38.320 --> 15:39.160
Yes, yes.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.480
Okay.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.480
So...

15:42.480 --> 15:43.800
All right.

15:43.800 --> 15:49.280
So, I rather prefer not to talk about humans anymore,

15:49.280 --> 15:50.960
and we as an anthropology,

15:50.960 --> 15:53.640
and that's also very interesting, our stop and reflect

15:53.640 --> 15:57.800
of how to call actually our new alliances within the world.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.360
And that makes it even more interesting

16:00.560 --> 16:04.640
because physics is dealing by definition with what is not living,

16:04.640 --> 16:08.000
while biology and so on is dealing with what is alive.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.280
And we are shattering these kind of conceptions

16:10.280 --> 16:11.280
out of different reasons.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.360
On the one hand, because there are many cosmologies

16:13.360 --> 16:15.920
like Southern American cosmologies

16:15.920 --> 16:20.640
or Antarctic cosmologies and people who live

16:20.640 --> 16:23.200
in these regions who would never distinct

16:23.200 --> 16:25.200
between living and un-living.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.200
And on the other hand, because...

16:27.920 --> 16:29.920
And on the other hand, because...

16:29.920 --> 16:34.520
And made the others after the Gaia development

16:34.520 --> 16:36.480
of James Lovelock and so on,

16:36.480 --> 16:38.880
come to another perception of understanding the Earth

16:38.880 --> 16:43.160
and humans within the Earth when they took the perspective

16:43.160 --> 16:46.080
out of the extraterrestrial perspective on Earth

16:46.080 --> 16:48.520
that emerged with the Kodak picture of 1972

16:48.520 --> 16:50.960
of the Apollo Kodak picture of Earth.

16:50.960 --> 16:55.280
So, I like the word Terence, which is a new term,

16:55.280 --> 16:56.680
a post-humanist term,

16:56.680 --> 16:59.320
deployed by Deborah Danowski, Bruno Latour

16:59.320 --> 17:01.440
and Eduardo Vivero Stikasto

17:01.440 --> 17:03.840
for those aware and grounded beings

17:03.840 --> 17:06.560
and things opposing modern just humans

17:06.560 --> 17:08.200
and their objectifications.

17:08.200 --> 17:12.000
And that allows me to understand anthropology in a new way.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.760
I study Anthropos and its ethnoi,

17:14.760 --> 17:17.760
so their people and communities on all scales,

17:17.760 --> 17:20.160
but I stopped to think this kind of kinship

17:20.160 --> 17:22.680
that we traditionally had just amongst humans.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.800
There are new modes of kin, kin with Earth,

17:24.800 --> 17:27.360
kin with trees, other forms of relations,

17:27.360 --> 17:29.160
and that makes it all interesting.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.000
And from an alien point of view,

17:31.000 --> 17:33.840
we are all Earthlings or Terence.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.520
And it seems to me that this message

17:35.520 --> 17:38.960
is the most important one one can share out of my field

17:38.960 --> 17:42.120
of studying the so-called reasonable physicists

17:42.120 --> 17:44.800
because physicists actually have quite a similar perception

17:44.800 --> 17:46.520
on these things.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.560
And they are, on the other hand,

17:48.560 --> 17:50.600
gatekeepers of modern humanism,

17:50.600 --> 17:53.000
inventors of the worldwide web protocol

17:53.000 --> 17:56.120
and main forces in the development of computer simulations.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.080
To dare to think from a futurist's perspective,

18:02.080 --> 18:05.840
to turn science fiction into contemporary every day

18:05.840 --> 18:08.520
was for me one of the most fascinating aspects

18:08.520 --> 18:10.760
I observed at CERN.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.840
CERN is a collaborative digital enterprise.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.760
Each individual is connected to various media

18:16.760 --> 18:19.000
and is transforming into something else,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.320
not only into a digital divideral,

18:21.320 --> 18:23.880
that's a concept that emerged by Marilyn's CERN

18:23.880 --> 18:26.240
to understand Papua New Guinea societies,

18:26.240 --> 18:27.720
which do not have people there,

18:27.720 --> 18:29.360
do not have an individualist concept

18:29.360 --> 18:31.960
as we do have here in Europe.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.800
But actually it seems to me into something

18:33.800 --> 18:37.360
what I want to call with the help of quantum mechanical

18:37.360 --> 18:40.040
natural philosophy, intra-vigral.

18:40.040 --> 18:44.080
So I'm connecting the intra and the inner of the individual

18:44.080 --> 18:46.320
on the one hand with the collectivity.

18:46.320 --> 18:49.920
And it turns that in these kind of scientific collaborations

18:49.920 --> 18:52.920
that are based on digital tools,

18:52.920 --> 18:56.920
the solitary of the single researcher

18:56.920 --> 18:58.960
becomes a solitary being

18:58.960 --> 19:02.480
with all its productive and destructive forces and dynamics.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.240
And what is really fascinating is that physicists

19:07.240 --> 19:10.080
are all the time not only trying to deal

19:10.080 --> 19:13.760
and resonate with science fiction as a fixtures metaphor,

19:13.760 --> 19:15.480
but really try to think the future

19:15.480 --> 19:16.520
and have to think the future

19:16.520 --> 19:18.800
because their experiments are happening in the future.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.840
I will come to this in the following.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.200
In order to make this point,

19:24.200 --> 19:25.720
I get down to Earth with you

19:25.720 --> 19:27.560
into the everyday of fictions of science

19:27.560 --> 19:30.800
or how bugs, Martin and screw and others

19:30.800 --> 19:32.240
are intervening everyday physics

19:32.240 --> 19:35.320
and how the biggest resistance is coming from materiality

19:35.320 --> 19:37.040
and also interestingly enough,

19:37.040 --> 19:39.280
a certain type of masculinity

19:39.280 --> 19:42.240
and discursive practice and rights.

19:42.240 --> 19:45.520
Physics can still teach us something about the future,

19:45.520 --> 19:48.760
especially how to deal with that, what we do not know,

19:48.760 --> 19:52.320
and yet how to deal with expectations and power relations.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.640
But first, I want to tell you how I ended up at CERN

19:57.640 --> 19:59.320
and what brought me into the situation

19:59.320 --> 20:01.520
where I'm in right now.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.560
In my first field, I was doing research in Vienna.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.760
I was discussing with local artists and writers in Austria

20:07.760 --> 20:10.240
about the relation of words and worlds

20:10.240 --> 20:11.160
and what to make of it

20:11.160 --> 20:14.120
when it comes to cultural identity politics.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.640
From a German speaking case, that's very fascinating

20:16.640 --> 20:19.400
because some of you might know that Hitler was Austrian,

20:19.400 --> 20:26.400
but he became the leader of the German Empire.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.400
And after the Second World War,

20:28.400 --> 20:31.480
the Austrians had to become actually an own nation state

20:31.480 --> 20:34.720
and they are a good example of successful nation building.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.200
So the successful creation of a collective identity

20:37.200 --> 20:39.960
and writers played in a very important role

20:39.960 --> 20:42.600
when it came up to deal with the atrocities committed

20:42.600 --> 20:44.120
in the name of the German people

20:44.160 --> 20:46.800
that Austrians tried to push away from themselves

20:46.800 --> 20:48.360
but had to made aware, of course,

20:48.360 --> 20:52.680
because anti-Semitism and everything that went along

20:52.680 --> 20:54.000
with the atrocities committed

20:54.000 --> 20:56.600
and the crimes committed in the name of the German people

20:56.600 --> 21:00.080
were also committed in and by Austrians and from Austrians, too.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.280
And that fascinated me a lot.

21:02.280 --> 21:05.080
And I came into this field and did this research

21:05.080 --> 21:06.880
and one wonders how do I end up at CERN

21:06.880 --> 21:09.040
and there are many, many different reasons why.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.800
But one of them was actually an epistemic problem.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.600
And the epistemic problem was the question

21:13.600 --> 21:17.240
how to deal and understand what I said in the beginning,

21:17.240 --> 21:20.560
how to understand in real time in the now something

21:20.560 --> 21:24.280
that is happening while I'm part of what is part of the system.

21:27.360 --> 21:30.160
And it was the hottest summer in Vienna,

21:30.160 --> 21:33.920
a steel melting heat near the New River.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.720
And one afternoon, the sky was filled with baroque clouds

21:36.720 --> 21:38.760
and rain was about to come.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.320
And the wind blew through the streets.

21:40.320 --> 21:43.440
I watched it from my window and it all sounds very poetic.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.920
But also I started to think.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.440
A tree just beneath the house waved its crown

21:48.440 --> 21:50.400
and I started to watch the leaves.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.040
And from the whole of the leaves,

21:52.040 --> 21:54.640
I tried to follow the movement of each one of the leaves,

21:54.640 --> 21:57.880
tried to perceive all different movements of each leaf

21:57.880 --> 22:01.160
of this one tree waving in the wind back and forth

22:01.160 --> 22:03.440
at the same time.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.120
I don't know whether the thought that we as humans

22:06.120 --> 22:08.720
are like these leaves on the Gaia tree

22:08.720 --> 22:10.920
or whether the thousand movements of the tree

22:10.920 --> 22:12.560
in the wind came first.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.480
But I understood in that moment why any observer,

22:15.480 --> 22:18.120
even the most unentangled sitting on a window

22:18.120 --> 22:21.120
and staring into the streets or onto this tree,

22:21.120 --> 22:23.920
is not able to capture historical time

22:23.920 --> 22:25.280
and its complexity.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.400
For this tree is moved by the wind,

22:28.400 --> 22:31.960
but the thermodynamics are transforming each micro area

22:31.960 --> 22:34.680
into another zone and each leaf is a leaf on its own

22:34.680 --> 22:38.760
and left alone while at the same time connected to the tree.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.480
You see where I'm going

22:40.480 --> 22:42.480
and maybe understand this allegory.

22:42.480 --> 22:45.720
Why I thought that I had to head into the world of physics

22:45.720 --> 22:49.040
to give the spatial concept of ethnographic fields

22:49.040 --> 22:52.640
and observer another temporal dimension.

22:52.640 --> 22:55.600
Since then, I wonder why Bronislav Malinovsky,

22:55.600 --> 22:58.120
one of the founding figures of anthropology

22:58.120 --> 23:00.640
who studied physics first in Kraków,

23:00.640 --> 23:02.400
did not follow quantum mechanics

23:02.400 --> 23:05.520
and did not include into his concepts of ethnography

23:05.520 --> 23:08.920
at that time the experimental insights

23:08.920 --> 23:11.280
that actually shattered the world of the 1920s

23:11.280 --> 23:12.800
and 1930s in physics.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.800
It was the tree in front

23:15.800 --> 23:17.680
of my first Viennese field department,

23:17.680 --> 23:20.080
Albert Gassevillon 20, Sieb der Bezirk,

23:20.080 --> 23:22.400
that led me to a fatal book choice

23:22.400 --> 23:26.280
in my favorite book shop of that time, Buchhandlung Posch.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.920
I was sitting on a wooden chair

23:27.920 --> 23:30.720
where many famous Austrian writers said before

23:30.720 --> 23:32.760
as the owner of the shop reminded me

23:32.760 --> 23:36.720
as part of his peculiar Viennese sales psychology,

23:36.720 --> 23:41.120
which always mixes a sense of clients' unwelcoming,

23:41.120 --> 23:44.280
owners' entitlement and traditionality

23:44.280 --> 23:46.720
disguised in ancienité

23:46.720 --> 23:49.960
to give things a value beyond its market price.

23:51.040 --> 23:54.640
I saw Lisa Randall's book, Theoretical Physicist,

23:54.640 --> 23:57.480
Warp Passages, unraveling the mysteries

23:57.480 --> 24:01.080
of the university's hidden dimensions.

24:01.080 --> 24:02.800
And back then I didn't know that I one day

24:02.800 --> 24:06.000
would become friends with Lisa Randall and climb with her,

24:06.000 --> 24:07.480
but I was really surprised

24:07.480 --> 24:10.240
because the way nature was made

24:10.240 --> 24:12.200
in her pop scientific account

24:12.200 --> 24:16.280
and how culture and cultural ideas were deployed

24:16.280 --> 24:21.200
in a, to me, very uncareful way really just puzzled me.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.280
And from that moment I knew I had to get

24:23.280 --> 24:26.640
to know physicists better because they shape the world

24:26.640 --> 24:28.880
and they have a very strong cosmology

24:28.880 --> 24:31.520
and they use cultural ideas in a way

24:31.520 --> 24:35.200
that really are surprising for me as a cultural scientist.

24:35.240 --> 24:38.160
And it was clear to me where I had to go after

24:38.160 --> 24:40.560
and to learn more about the culture

24:40.560 --> 24:42.920
after I was studying poets.

24:42.920 --> 24:44.560
It was the wind and the tree

24:44.560 --> 24:46.760
that led me into the world of physics.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.600
And then I went to CERN.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.200
At CERN though, I encountered different ways

24:54.200 --> 24:55.840
of dealing with space and time.

24:55.840 --> 24:58.160
And actually what time as such could be

24:58.160 --> 25:01.360
and was did not bother anybody near Lake Geneva.

25:01.360 --> 25:05.800
As Isabelle Stengers put it, I quote her,

25:05.800 --> 25:09.920
clearly a certain type of prophetic physics exists today,

25:09.920 --> 25:12.440
but if we must speak of physics,

25:12.440 --> 25:14.800
wouldn't it be preferable to approach it

25:14.800 --> 25:17.360
from the viewpoint of the new undertaking

25:17.360 --> 25:19.960
known as big science?

25:19.960 --> 25:21.640
International financing,

25:21.640 --> 25:24.280
the construction of large scale instruments,

25:24.280 --> 25:25.800
management of an experiment

25:25.800 --> 25:28.160
over a period of several years,

25:28.160 --> 25:30.960
the organization of large numbers of colleagues,

25:30.960 --> 25:32.440
the division of labor,

25:32.440 --> 25:34.800
these are the kind of practical questions

25:34.800 --> 25:38.800
that preoccupied cutting edge physicists today

25:38.800 --> 25:43.040
far more than the ideal questions of physicists vocation.

25:43.040 --> 25:46.440
And so today, I want to share with you

25:46.440 --> 25:48.960
what we can learn from contemporary physics

25:48.960 --> 25:50.520
when it comes to deal with the futures

25:50.520 --> 25:52.800
in our anthropology as well.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.960
And this encompasses foremost a way

25:54.960 --> 25:57.560
of dealing with uncertainties of all kinds,

25:57.560 --> 26:00.040
focusing on hardware, software

26:00.040 --> 26:04.840
and dealing with a certain type of practiced masculinity.

26:04.840 --> 26:07.840
It means of transformation of individualist perspective

26:07.840 --> 26:11.680
into an intra-visualist vision.

26:11.680 --> 26:14.280
I owe these insights to my field

26:14.280 --> 26:16.640
and especially to the women in physics.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.280
Some of them became friends of mine,

26:18.280 --> 26:21.640
male and female, and I'm very glad about that.

26:21.640 --> 26:23.480
Before I entered, people were warning me

26:23.480 --> 26:27.000
that I quote should not ask the gender question,

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
end of quotation, that it is the quote death question

26:30.000 --> 26:31.520
end of quotation.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.760
And I never had to ask it.

26:33.760 --> 26:37.920
It was always answered without asking me for it.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.200
Since it's such an important and dominant topic,

26:40.200 --> 26:42.480
people just started to talk about themselves

26:42.480 --> 26:45.560
without that I even put it up.

26:47.840 --> 26:51.680
But before I'm diving into the gender question,

26:51.680 --> 26:56.680
I want to show you some of those levels of uncertainty

26:57.440 --> 26:59.080
that exists at CERN

26:59.080 --> 27:01.360
and why actually thinking the future

27:01.360 --> 27:04.840
and rules are so important at this research site.

27:04.840 --> 27:08.240
The pictures that you see are either taken by myself

27:08.240 --> 27:12.160
or you find them on the website of the CERN collaboration.

27:14.520 --> 27:17.200
Multiple agents weave the fabric of uncertainty

27:17.200 --> 27:19.040
in a data-driven workspace,

27:19.040 --> 27:22.000
at the same time orchestrating the ubiquitous phantasma

27:22.000 --> 27:24.320
of certainty in an ever more unstable

27:24.320 --> 27:27.320
economical, political, global reality.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.600
In this talk, I will look at the current condition

27:29.600 --> 27:31.880
going beyond the entanglement of hardware,

27:31.880 --> 27:34.120
software, algorithm and infrastructure

27:34.120 --> 27:35.840
as it has been done already.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.640
What interests me is how humans interact with one another

27:38.640 --> 27:40.120
when interacting with machines

27:40.120 --> 27:42.040
in liberal structures of patriarchy,

27:42.040 --> 27:45.760
so fundamental in the shaping of the data-driven world.

27:45.760 --> 27:49.160
I put a particular emphasis on the rhythms of doing things

27:49.160 --> 27:52.640
by investigating the importance of cuts and ruptures,

27:52.640 --> 27:57.480
disturbing and destabilizing seemingly stable infrastructures.

27:57.480 --> 28:01.040
Because when actually the infrastructure falls apart,

28:01.040 --> 28:03.360
some hidden structures become visible

28:03.360 --> 28:05.040
and that is something that fascinates me

28:05.040 --> 28:08.520
when I talked about the subversion, for example, initially.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.760
I will briefly mention uncertainties of hardware

28:10.760 --> 28:13.000
and materialities as well as software

28:13.000 --> 28:14.640
to come to the main point of this talk

28:14.640 --> 28:17.120
dealing with reasonable humans and power.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.000
One of the most political ones in times

28:19.000 --> 28:21.320
of so-called gender wars

28:21.360 --> 28:23.600
and heated discussions about identity politics

28:23.600 --> 28:25.280
versus cultural dominations,

28:25.280 --> 28:29.040
where the realms of universality and exclusivity

28:29.040 --> 28:31.200
are renegotiated.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.560
I will end my talk with the introduction of another neologism,

28:34.560 --> 28:36.880
the individual that I already introduced to you

28:36.880 --> 28:38.600
and reflect upon anthropologists

28:38.600 --> 28:43.040
as trailblazing pathfinders of futures beyond the standard now,

28:43.040 --> 28:45.600
because that is what actually makes us so special

28:45.600 --> 28:47.520
amongst the humanities and social sciences.

28:47.520 --> 28:52.320
We're really able to take a little piece of the future

28:52.320 --> 28:56.680
and just talk about it and drag it into what's actually going on

28:56.680 --> 28:59.560
because we are listening carefully to the people.

28:59.560 --> 29:02.480
I'm interested today, especially in the questions of human relations

29:02.480 --> 29:05.160
to one another within such apparatuses

29:05.160 --> 29:08.080
regarding gender and race politics as dominant aspect

29:08.080 --> 29:10.000
of what is about to come.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.680
How does the servant manipulate the master to frame it he-like?

29:14.680 --> 29:18.000
In turning from an individual to something I call intravigil,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.440
a concerned being that foresees the future

29:20.440 --> 29:24.640
and plots in companionship with an agent multiplicity.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.280
This is where subaltern studies

29:26.280 --> 29:28.760
in complex flat hierarchies lead,

29:28.760 --> 29:32.280
for certain prides itself to have flat hierarchies,

29:32.280 --> 29:35.880
but in fact, no hierarchy is flat when white males

29:35.880 --> 29:39.720
and their tools are on the run to assert risk management.

29:39.720 --> 29:41.520
And why does this matter again?

29:41.520 --> 29:43.360
Why do I put up this whole question?

29:43.360 --> 29:47.560
Because high energy physics relies on big data interpreted

29:47.560 --> 29:50.680
and calculated using methods like those implemented

29:50.680 --> 29:53.160
in assessing stock market value.

29:53.160 --> 29:56.360
The constant flow of knowledge and human resources

29:56.360 --> 29:59.560
from the scientific institution to the financial sector

29:59.560 --> 30:03.560
is one of the arguments legitimizing the existence of CERN.

30:03.560 --> 30:07.680
And the big bank companies of Geneva, of course,

30:07.680 --> 30:11.280
are profiting from the flow of PhD grad students

30:11.280 --> 30:15.760
that are flowing from CERN directly into the banking system

30:15.760 --> 30:17.760
or to Google and so on and so on.

30:19.480 --> 30:21.680
The human factor is the most crucial element

30:21.680 --> 30:24.200
to understand uncertainty in a data-driven world.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.160
The future of our economic system

30:26.160 --> 30:29.160
is bound to research and sciences of many sorts.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.840
It does not only matter with whom we are thinking thoughts,

30:31.840 --> 30:35.360
but how we learn to responsibly use media and tools.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.160
When it comes to what will happen,

30:37.200 --> 30:42.000
uncertainty is the eternal constant of humanity's concern.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.040
Uncertainty is encountered on all levels of experimental research,

30:46.040 --> 30:49.960
from planning over construction and coding to measuring nature.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.480
A few questions remain.

30:51.480 --> 30:54.280
What and how do people learn to interact socially

30:54.280 --> 30:57.000
when dealing with data and computing environments?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.600
And what kind of uncertainties are they exposed to

30:59.600 --> 31:01.560
in data-driven spaces?

31:03.760 --> 31:06.880
The hardware is always uncertain.

31:06.880 --> 31:10.120
Those who follow the developments of grand scientific experiments

31:10.120 --> 31:14.800
might remember that the start of the Large Hadron Collider in 2008,

31:14.800 --> 31:16.600
the world's biggest physics experiment

31:16.600 --> 31:19.120
had been delayed by one year because of a loose screw.

31:19.120 --> 31:22.680
And here you see the picture of the explosion

31:22.680 --> 31:25.040
that was just happening

31:25.040 --> 31:28.200
because one screw wasn't tightened well enough.

31:28.200 --> 31:32.440
A tiny physical object caused a gargantuan obstacle to the machine,

31:32.440 --> 31:36.360
whose maintenance costs exceed one billion euros per year,

31:36.360 --> 31:38.760
and each citizen of the European Union, by the way,

31:38.760 --> 31:44.320
pays five euros per year to CERN when you take your tax money.

31:44.320 --> 31:48.400
Meanwhile, all the algorithms, when this happens, did still.

31:48.400 --> 31:51.640
And a tiny, seemingly unimportant object shattered magnets

31:51.640 --> 31:56.880
and within the dreams of the first data harvest of the Higgs boson.

31:56.880 --> 32:00.240
For those of you who are not champs in Big Bang Theory at school,

32:00.240 --> 32:03.200
the Higgs boson is a particle within the standard model

32:03.200 --> 32:05.680
which gives mass to other particles

32:05.680 --> 32:10.680
and helps to explain why our universe is not just made out of light and energy.

32:10.680 --> 32:13.120
The Higgs, of course, is much smaller than the screw,

32:13.120 --> 32:17.600
and unlike the screw, it is invisible to the human eye.

32:17.600 --> 32:23.200
Paradoxically, the screw was neither seen nor foreseen

32:23.200 --> 32:25.200
and that it would break,

32:25.200 --> 32:27.120
delaying the experiment by one year,

32:27.120 --> 32:29.600
while the Higgs, on the other hand, was foreseen,

32:29.600 --> 32:34.520
simulated and calculated long before the digital experimental system.

32:34.520 --> 32:37.480
Actually, the whole Large Hadron Collider is a big bet

32:37.480 --> 32:44.560
that was made up in the 1960s when Peter Higgs came up with this theory.

32:44.560 --> 32:48.280
With the help of pseudo-random Monte Carlo simulations

32:48.280 --> 32:53.000
and incorporating and unthinking and ontologically consolidating random

32:53.000 --> 32:56.840
to put it bluntly, physics is actually creating

32:56.840 --> 32:59.280
futurist imaginaries through its theories

32:59.280 --> 33:06.440
and physicists are serving as modern future tellers, fortune tellers.

33:06.440 --> 33:12.000
Like historians, physicists interpret temporal traces,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.880
but this is called a histogram, as most of you know.

33:14.880 --> 33:20.720
So, histogram, it is a grammatics of the history of the Higgs particle

33:20.720 --> 33:24.160
that you can see here and the events actually that were piling up

33:24.160 --> 33:26.240
to show the existence of the Higgs particle.

33:26.240 --> 33:29.280
That's something that physicists work with, not with the beautiful images

33:29.280 --> 33:32.680
we know from the Higgs boson, maybe.

33:32.680 --> 33:35.800
So, like historians, physicists interpret temporal traces,

33:35.800 --> 33:39.000
but unlike historians, they simulate the events beforehand

33:39.000 --> 33:42.040
and check afterwards what might have happened,

33:42.040 --> 33:44.160
to say it with Leopold Ranke.

33:44.160 --> 33:48.320
High energy physics is a security-driven world investigating nature,

33:48.320 --> 33:50.960
which on the one hand is determined by laws

33:50.960 --> 33:55.240
and on the other characterized by random behaviors, the uncertainty.

33:55.240 --> 33:58.440
The drive to make data on measurements as certain as possible

33:58.440 --> 34:02.160
exerts an influence on how information is perceived.

34:02.160 --> 34:05.120
This road to scientific certainty, however,

34:05.120 --> 34:08.520
is paved with present uncertainties of all kinds.

34:08.520 --> 34:11.840
I have written about incidents like the one of the screw elsewhere

34:11.840 --> 34:14.840
and if you're interested, I'm happy to send you a copy of this article,

34:14.840 --> 34:18.080
which deals not only with the screw screwed, the start of the Higgs,

34:18.080 --> 34:21.040
but also how a martin, a bird, bugs,

34:21.040 --> 34:24.120
and finally the physical resistance of materiality itself

34:24.120 --> 34:26.080
are constant factors to deal with

34:26.080 --> 34:29.960
when planning and dealing with an experiment that will run for decades.

34:32.040 --> 34:35.360
I came to the conclusion that physicists are unconsciously acting out

34:35.360 --> 34:38.480
like the most prolific historiographic theorists of,

34:38.480 --> 34:40.560
like, for example, Reinhard Kozellik,

34:40.560 --> 34:43.520
envisioning human beings in historicity on the one hand,

34:43.520 --> 34:47.920
hermeneutically tracing patterns of the past by simulating it beforehand,

34:47.920 --> 34:50.960
and on the other by constantly pushing the space of experience

34:50.960 --> 34:53.720
into horizons of expectation.

34:53.720 --> 34:56.600
Physicists love to think of the future.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.680
I sometimes wonder whether ever and if,

34:58.680 --> 35:03.320
but in addition of anthropology today in 2123,

35:03.320 --> 35:05.720
of, for example, anthropology would look like,

35:05.720 --> 35:08.880
but physics today exists and that is really fascinating.

35:08.880 --> 35:15.160
Physicists are giving up or writing journals

35:15.160 --> 35:18.480
and wonder how physics in 100 years' look would look like.

35:18.480 --> 35:23.200
Anthropologists, I couldn't imagine any of our discipline

35:23.280 --> 35:28.560
being that bold to actually envision anthropology in 100 years.

35:32.120 --> 35:34.680
The second degree of uncertainty after the materiality

35:34.680 --> 35:38.360
that I just presented to you with a screw may be found in software.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.960
Not only lose screws pose danger to the stability

35:40.960 --> 35:43.960
of experimental infrastructure, but also bugs,

35:43.960 --> 35:46.840
those of the digital kind needless to say.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.560
The software used at CERN needs to be programmed,

35:49.560 --> 35:52.520
but more importantly, constantly maintained.

35:52.520 --> 35:56.000
This daily care defines the work rhythms of high-energy physicists

35:56.000 --> 35:58.760
to spend most of their time hunting down bugs

35:58.760 --> 36:01.320
and keeping digital storage in order.

36:01.320 --> 36:05.760
Individual human visions need to be aligned to reach a common goal.

36:05.760 --> 36:09.200
The gathered data on particles stored on farms all over the world

36:09.200 --> 36:13.520
is analyzed by collaborations with the help of a network called GRID,

36:13.520 --> 36:15.360
which spans the globe.

36:15.360 --> 36:18.640
It guarantees that heaps of data can be processed.

36:18.640 --> 36:21.360
Since machine learning algorithms help to analyze

36:21.360 --> 36:23.800
the pattern recognition of physical events,

36:23.800 --> 36:27.720
feeding the nodes with the right input is crucial to the frame

36:27.720 --> 36:29.680
to the most surveilled uncertainty

36:29.680 --> 36:32.600
within current informatics apparatuses.

36:32.600 --> 36:35.000
The X4 factor brought out into the game

36:35.000 --> 36:37.680
through artificial intelligences of utmost importance

36:37.680 --> 36:40.800
and interest is something I think some of you are dealing with

36:40.800 --> 36:43.560
in person also in your work.

36:43.560 --> 36:47.680
Each human task is registered by the so-called ticket on GitHub,

36:47.680 --> 36:51.080
a software development and management platform.

36:51.080 --> 36:55.320
The memory of the task will be gone as soon as the ticket on GitHub

36:55.320 --> 36:58.320
is solved and resolved.

36:58.320 --> 37:02.040
If the code is working, computers do not need to keep the memory

37:02.040 --> 37:05.480
of human actions, do not need to have a trace of historicity

37:05.480 --> 37:09.280
how a failure came into being and was resolved.

37:09.280 --> 37:13.160
In that sense, bugs produce a certain form of casualty,

37:13.160 --> 37:18.320
which happens from case to case, casualité, not causality,

37:18.320 --> 37:21.560
from case to case, from one solve ticket to the other.

37:21.560 --> 37:23.200
Once the chain of problem is solved,

37:23.200 --> 37:25.720
however, there are no casual traces left

37:25.720 --> 37:28.800
and so the origins of the bug are forgotten.

37:28.800 --> 37:32.080
To keep the otherwise lost socio-technical memory,

37:32.080 --> 37:34.320
physicists keep personal lab books,

37:34.320 --> 37:38.000
make nodes not unlike anthropologists keep field diaries.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.320
Scheming capital M guy.

37:44.320 --> 37:47.320
While some people are great in solving bug problems,

37:47.320 --> 37:51.320
others seem to be much better in coding bugs into the system,

37:51.320 --> 37:54.320
often without being held accountable for their mistakes

37:54.320 --> 37:56.320
or causing a pile of additional work

37:56.320 --> 38:00.320
by misinterpreting the work schedule.

38:00.320 --> 38:05.320
The first ones are usually devoted graduate students

38:05.320 --> 38:08.320
who solve the problems and the latter ones,

38:08.320 --> 38:12.320
often long time ago grads, older, politically experienced,

38:12.320 --> 38:16.320
predominantly white male members of the collaboration.

38:16.320 --> 38:18.320
Even in the cosmopolitan experimental group

38:18.320 --> 38:20.320
such as the Large Hadron Collider of CERN,

38:20.320 --> 38:22.320
where hierarchies are allegedly flat,

38:22.320 --> 38:25.320
age, gender, experience and national allegiance matter

38:25.320 --> 38:29.320
and people reflect upon this all the time, as I will show now.

38:29.320 --> 38:32.320
In hierarchical environments of highly specialized

38:32.320 --> 38:34.320
and distributed work spheres,

38:34.320 --> 38:36.320
where complex problems need to be solved

38:36.320 --> 38:39.320
in short bursts of time and goals reached,

38:39.320 --> 38:43.320
human often need to plot, not only scientific diagrams,

38:43.320 --> 38:46.320
but also intrigues of all kinds, politics,

38:46.320 --> 38:50.320
as you all know who work at the university, matter most.

38:50.320 --> 38:53.320
This often happens because leading positions are occupied

38:53.320 --> 38:58.320
by older physicists, elderlies, who are politically experienced,

38:58.320 --> 39:01.320
but not anymore up to date with the most recent applied work,

39:01.320 --> 39:04.320
like programming itself.

39:04.320 --> 39:08.320
Anat Singh anthropologist refers to the representatives

39:08.320 --> 39:11.320
of these groups as the so-called capital man guy,

39:11.320 --> 39:13.320
capital M, big M guy.

39:13.320 --> 39:16.320
At CERN, the capital M guys are predominantly,

39:16.320 --> 39:19.320
I quote another Harvard professor of particle physics,

39:19.320 --> 39:23.320
a female, reasonable European man,

39:23.320 --> 39:25.320
adding that she could not breathe at CERN

39:25.320 --> 39:28.320
because of their omnipresence.

39:28.320 --> 39:32.320
The data-driven world is full of capital M guys.

39:32.320 --> 39:34.320
To deal with the amount of uncertainty,

39:34.320 --> 39:37.320
they create an armament of strategic tools

39:37.320 --> 39:39.320
that need to be brought in to manipulate

39:39.320 --> 39:42.320
those experienced power-driven manipulators.

39:42.320 --> 39:45.320
It would have even impressed military strategists

39:45.320 --> 39:49.320
such as Sun Tzu or Karl von Klausowitz.

39:49.320 --> 39:52.320
The trick is to play the game with closed cards,

39:52.320 --> 39:54.320
but along the rules at the same time,

39:54.320 --> 39:56.320
weaving alliances behind their back

39:56.320 --> 39:58.320
and winning the right authorities figures over.

39:58.320 --> 40:01.320
So I'm going to show you now how actually

40:01.320 --> 40:04.320
what kind of subversive strategies people,

40:04.320 --> 40:06.320
PhD students, grad students, deploy

40:07.320 --> 40:09.320
to come and reach their goals,

40:09.320 --> 40:12.320
although they are not in the power positions.

40:15.320 --> 40:18.320
The PhD students at CERN learn to play those double games

40:18.320 --> 40:21.320
along with the mastery of code at the same time.

40:21.320 --> 40:24.320
The social skills then they are wandering into,

40:24.320 --> 40:25.320
and these social skills,

40:25.320 --> 40:26.320
and that's fascinating,

40:26.320 --> 40:28.320
are wandering into the financially

40:28.320 --> 40:31.320
and into the financial and into the technical sectors.

40:31.320 --> 40:33.320
So they take what they learn at CERN

40:34.320 --> 40:36.320
and bring this kind of work culture

40:36.320 --> 40:37.320
into the other work cultures,

40:37.320 --> 40:41.320
which are not anymore in science and at the university.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.320
I assume each workspace

40:43.320 --> 40:46.320
generates its own terroir of scheming,

40:46.320 --> 40:48.320
but CERN can be, I quote,

40:48.320 --> 40:49.320
a true vipers nest,

40:49.320 --> 40:52.320
as physicists with years of experience

40:52.320 --> 40:53.320
once said to me,

40:53.320 --> 40:55.320
or a cog association,

40:55.320 --> 40:57.320
as a female grad student said to another

40:57.320 --> 40:59.320
when listening to her latest sister's

40:59.320 --> 41:00.320
truce meeting experience.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.320
I quote,

41:01.320 --> 41:04.320
Interestingly, when I'm talking to male grad students,

41:04.320 --> 41:06.320
they all seem not to experience such incidents,

41:06.320 --> 41:09.320
but all females have had the same experience.

41:09.320 --> 41:10.320
How can you measure something

41:10.320 --> 41:12.320
that can't be nailed through worlds?

41:12.320 --> 41:13.320
Asks Mia Ferrari,

41:13.320 --> 41:15.320
one of my closest interlocutors

41:15.320 --> 41:17.320
who turned into a friend of mine later.

41:19.320 --> 41:21.320
In supremacist environments,

41:21.320 --> 41:23.320
cunningness is the most important virtue.

41:23.320 --> 41:26.320
Documenting is documenting is key,

41:26.320 --> 41:29.320
and social engineering is an everyday common

41:29.320 --> 41:31.320
that starts even before the moments when the gates

41:31.320 --> 41:35.320
to the research sites are crossed.

41:35.320 --> 41:37.320
The case of Claire.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.320
I had the chance to record a small episode

41:40.320 --> 41:42.320
demonstrating this daily phenomenon

41:42.320 --> 41:43.320
with the help of Claire Covet,

41:43.320 --> 41:45.320
a grad student from North America.

41:45.320 --> 41:48.320
I promised her to be as vague as possible

41:48.320 --> 41:50.320
about the technicalities of her workgroup

41:50.320 --> 41:52.320
since the specific community is small,

41:52.320 --> 41:54.320
and Covet was, I quote,

41:54.320 --> 41:57.320
on the market this fall and graduating next year

41:57.320 --> 41:59.320
when I conducted the interview.

41:59.320 --> 42:01.320
Claire is working on the upgrade

42:01.320 --> 42:03.320
of one of the LHC detectors when I met her

42:03.320 --> 42:05.320
and had to guarantee its efficiency

42:05.320 --> 42:07.320
for the third season in the game of bosons,

42:07.320 --> 42:09.320
as some Cerenes love to call it,

42:09.320 --> 42:12.320
when energy and luminosity is about to be increased

42:12.320 --> 42:14.320
during the next run of the LHC,

42:14.320 --> 42:17.320
which started last year in 2022.

42:17.320 --> 42:19.320
In her work, Claire discovered

42:19.320 --> 42:22.320
that some calculations had not been made correctly

42:22.320 --> 42:25.320
under the guidance of the team leader of her group.

42:25.320 --> 42:27.320
He is known for losing his temper

42:27.320 --> 42:30.320
and not able to admit a mistake.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.320
As a result, she needs to prove

42:32.320 --> 42:34.320
the correctness of her calculations

42:34.320 --> 42:37.320
and falsify the statements of her peer.

42:37.320 --> 42:40.320
But she's not the one that makes the meeting schedules.

42:40.320 --> 42:42.320
Her main goal was therefore to make space

42:42.320 --> 42:45.320
for her cause during the precious online meetings

42:45.320 --> 42:47.320
because she wanted that the system is running,

42:47.320 --> 42:50.320
that the experimental system will work at the end.

42:50.320 --> 42:52.320
To discuss her case,

42:52.320 --> 42:54.320
I met Covet in the upper section

42:54.320 --> 42:56.320
of her community building at CERN,

42:56.320 --> 42:58.320
in an area that is quite enough

42:58.320 --> 43:00.320
for recording and interview

43:00.320 --> 43:03.320
and remote enough for not being overheard by anyone.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.320
She chose the spot,

43:05.320 --> 43:07.320
and whenever someone who looked familiar to her

43:07.320 --> 43:09.320
seemed to come closer, she would tone down.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.320
I quote.

43:13.320 --> 43:15.320
Usually, oh, that's the wrong.

43:15.320 --> 43:17.320
Usually you can do it privately.

43:17.320 --> 43:20.320
Usually you do not need to do this.

43:20.320 --> 43:23.320
This particular guy is known for being difficult.

43:23.320 --> 43:25.320
Even now, his strategy in the meeting

43:25.320 --> 43:27.320
was to essentially force the issue offline,

43:27.320 --> 43:29.320
which we knew would happen.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.320
I already talked to the coordinators

43:31.320 --> 43:33.320
to get the relevant data to the team in the US

43:33.320 --> 43:35.320
so that they could do the calculations

43:35.320 --> 43:37.320
and send them back as quickly as possible

43:37.320 --> 43:39.320
to this other guy.

43:39.320 --> 43:42.320
Solving problems informally and offline

43:42.320 --> 43:44.320
means that there are no official records

43:44.320 --> 43:46.320
of how and if things are done.

43:46.320 --> 43:49.320
The off record space is a dangerous

43:49.320 --> 43:51.320
and difficult territory for those

43:51.320 --> 43:53.320
who are not having a say.

43:53.320 --> 43:55.320
Without heavy weights in the collaboration,

43:55.320 --> 43:57.320
nothing can be moved.

43:57.320 --> 43:59.320
But it's certainly not less dangerous

43:59.320 --> 44:02.320
as any other on the record turf.

44:02.320 --> 44:04.320
Claire argues that her boss is someone

44:04.320 --> 44:06.320
who needs to be addressed indirectly

44:06.320 --> 44:08.320
in a way that she describes as, I quote,

44:08.320 --> 44:10.320
backstage work.

44:11.320 --> 44:14.320
I knew I had to call out this guy and his team.

44:14.320 --> 44:17.320
I had opinions on him from the various people

44:17.320 --> 44:20.320
I know from heart rate so they could say

44:20.320 --> 44:22.320
what kind of play we had to make.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.320
I made sure when to send the slides out

44:24.320 --> 44:26.320
and I did not invite him to the meeting

44:26.320 --> 44:29.320
but the authorities figures did.

44:29.320 --> 44:31.320
The activity coordinators made sure

44:31.320 --> 44:34.320
that he would come to the meeting.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.320
Claire describes precisely how she had

44:36.320 --> 44:39.320
to weave alliances, winning authority figures.

44:39.320 --> 44:41.320
The whole plotting took time in consideration

44:41.320 --> 44:43.320
that she might have used more effectively

44:43.320 --> 44:46.320
for technical problems.

44:46.320 --> 44:48.320
I quote, I spread it about a period

44:48.320 --> 44:50.320
over two weeks and it took me

44:50.320 --> 44:52.320
maybe five hours of work

44:52.320 --> 44:54.320
but it is built on something.

44:54.320 --> 44:56.320
We have been talking about the coordinate system

44:56.320 --> 44:58.320
problem actually a year.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.320
I went back into the stack of my notebooks.

45:00.320 --> 45:02.320
I flipped back to find the relative facts

45:02.320 --> 45:04.320
and I started tracking this problem

45:04.320 --> 45:06.320
explicitly in detail on February 14th,

45:06.320 --> 45:08.320
2017, presented it

45:08.320 --> 45:11.320
on February 14th, 2018.

45:11.320 --> 45:13.320
So one year today I made

45:13.320 --> 45:15.320
my first measurements of the problem

45:15.320 --> 45:17.320
in December 2016 and we had

45:17.320 --> 45:19.320
been talking about it since February 2017.

45:19.320 --> 45:21.320
So that's the period of time

45:21.320 --> 45:23.320
it actually takes

45:23.320 --> 45:25.320
to win over

45:25.320 --> 45:27.320
when you're coming from the other side.

45:27.320 --> 45:29.320
In a language that

45:29.320 --> 45:31.320
oscillates between theater,

45:31.320 --> 45:33.320
American football

45:33.320 --> 45:35.320
and computer game vernacular,

45:35.320 --> 45:37.320
Claire describes her social engineering

45:37.320 --> 45:39.320
in order to solve a technical problem.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.320
She ends the episode by emphasizing

45:41.320 --> 45:43.320
that the whole issue has been caused

45:43.320 --> 45:45.320
because everyone has so many things to do

45:45.320 --> 45:47.320
explaining not without pride

45:47.320 --> 45:49.320
how she attracted long-term attention

45:49.320 --> 45:51.320
becoming a respectable member of

45:51.320 --> 45:53.320
the team despite being a woman.

45:55.320 --> 45:57.320
It is less an issue of breakdown

45:57.320 --> 45:59.320
and communication and more an issue

45:59.320 --> 46:01.320
of priority. People

46:01.320 --> 46:03.320
have so many things to do all the time

46:03.320 --> 46:05.320
that unless you put something on top of their priority list

46:05.320 --> 46:07.320
things will not work. I caused a scene.

46:07.320 --> 46:09.320
Now it's in the meeting notes.

46:09.320 --> 46:11.320
It has memories.

46:11.320 --> 46:13.320
They will not forget a young female graduate

46:13.320 --> 46:15.320
student calling out a senior member

46:15.320 --> 46:17.320
of the community. That's ballsy.

46:17.320 --> 46:19.320
So in doing that I reminded

46:19.320 --> 46:21.320
people what happened and I gave

46:21.320 --> 46:23.320
the touchdowns.

46:23.320 --> 46:25.320
It got to people's memories

46:25.320 --> 46:27.320
and next time we will have the meeting.

46:27.320 --> 46:29.320
They will ask what has been done

46:29.320 --> 46:31.320
with this.

46:31.320 --> 46:33.320
That's her workplace.

46:33.320 --> 46:35.320
The place of Claire Kovetz

46:35.320 --> 46:37.320
chose for telling me the story.

46:39.320 --> 46:41.320
The constant control that exercised

46:41.320 --> 46:43.320
to check whether we were potentially spotted

46:43.320 --> 46:45.320
in the moment. Later on her cleaner

46:45.320 --> 46:47.320
to be too precise about her work

46:47.320 --> 46:49.320
environment shows in the first place

46:49.320 --> 46:51.320
the uncertainty young graduate students are living in

46:51.320 --> 46:53.320
when working for a wide reasonable European

46:53.320 --> 46:55.320
man and the pressure of high-end

46:55.320 --> 46:57.320
institutions such as CERN.

46:57.320 --> 46:59.320
It exemplifies the unpredictably

46:59.320 --> 47:01.320
and vanity of leading authority

47:01.320 --> 47:03.320
figures and how the second and also

47:03.320 --> 47:05.320
the thirst and the drive

47:05.320 --> 47:07.320
for power and also

47:07.320 --> 47:09.320
how the second and third

47:09.320 --> 47:11.320
row of workers stabilize the system

47:11.320 --> 47:13.320
preventing ruptures and

47:13.320 --> 47:15.320
failures caused by the self

47:15.320 --> 47:17.320
and tight uncertainty of the capital M guy.

47:17.320 --> 47:19.320
Uncertainty

47:19.320 --> 47:21.320
is augmented by potential infrastructural

47:21.320 --> 47:23.320
ruptures caused by human failed

47:23.320 --> 47:25.320
attempt to overcome technical, physical

47:25.320 --> 47:27.320
or social obstacles.

47:27.320 --> 47:29.320
Synchronization, prioritization

47:29.320 --> 47:31.320
and the right rhythm

47:31.320 --> 47:33.320
to cut and resume communication

47:33.320 --> 47:35.320
in order to install a memory

47:35.320 --> 47:37.320
of an action seem to be

47:37.320 --> 47:39.320
essential in securing position and

47:39.320 --> 47:41.320
balancing the common goal of the collaboration

47:41.320 --> 47:43.320
and that has nothing

47:43.320 --> 47:45.320
interestingly enough to do with the kind of

47:45.320 --> 47:47.320
rhythms and memories of the computer.

47:47.320 --> 47:49.320
Preventing ruptures

47:49.320 --> 47:51.320
means circumventing and uncertainties

47:51.320 --> 47:53.320
means to exchange individuality

47:53.320 --> 47:55.320
against what I call intraviguality.

47:55.320 --> 47:57.320
CERN's case

47:57.320 --> 47:59.320
in the end was solved successfully.

47:59.320 --> 48:01.320
In her little area

48:01.320 --> 48:03.320
of caring concern everything was fine

48:03.320 --> 48:05.320
and on time once the LHC

48:05.320 --> 48:07.320
started in the season

48:07.320 --> 48:09.320
last year in 2022.

48:09.320 --> 48:11.320
Since we had our conversation

48:11.320 --> 48:13.320
that I shared with you today

48:13.320 --> 48:15.320
Claire got a prestigious postdoc position

48:15.320 --> 48:17.320
at an American elite university

48:17.320 --> 48:19.320
and is now an assistant professor

48:19.320 --> 48:21.320
at a renowned university in Europe.

48:21.320 --> 48:23.320
Her ability to become an intravigual

48:23.320 --> 48:25.320
her cunningness and consistency

48:25.320 --> 48:27.320
her notes, calculations and devotion

48:27.320 --> 48:29.320
and a big portion of chance

48:29.320 --> 48:31.320
secured her a place in the future of high

48:31.320 --> 48:33.320
energy physics.

48:35.320 --> 48:37.320
Awards in anthropology in the future.

48:39.320 --> 48:41.320
Screws as hardware and bugs

48:41.320 --> 48:43.320
as software may be considered agents

48:43.320 --> 48:45.320
of ruptures, schemers of cuts.

48:45.320 --> 48:47.320
They may be seen as vital forces

48:47.320 --> 48:49.320
shaping human dynamics in a data

48:49.320 --> 48:51.320
driven work environment.

48:51.320 --> 48:53.320
Scheming intrigues, plots and weaving

48:53.320 --> 48:55.320
the future in the now by dealing

48:55.320 --> 48:57.320
cunningly with collective group memory

48:57.320 --> 48:59.320
and gaining attention for future

48:59.320 --> 49:01.320
actions turns into a political tool.

49:01.320 --> 49:03.320
Differentiating between cuts

49:03.320 --> 49:05.320
and ruptures helps to distinguish

49:05.320 --> 49:07.320
between different modes of action

49:07.320 --> 49:09.320
and physically different actors as

49:09.320 --> 49:11.320
I learned from and with my colleague

49:11.320 --> 49:13.320
Lucas Meyerhofer physicist himself.

49:13.320 --> 49:15.320
It visualizes that hardware, software

49:15.320 --> 49:17.320
and humans are in seemingly seamless

49:17.320 --> 49:19.320
spaces always on the verge of disruption.

49:19.320 --> 49:21.320
It shows how people care

49:21.320 --> 49:23.320
within and about data driven worlds

49:23.320 --> 49:25.320
and above all it exemplifies

49:25.320 --> 49:27.320
that actions are happening in the

49:27.320 --> 49:29.320
fields of social forces

49:29.320 --> 49:31.320
and how the discurface structures

49:31.320 --> 49:33.320
influence actions especially actions

49:33.320 --> 49:35.320
in the digital era.

49:35.320 --> 49:37.320
It shows how we evolved from individuals

49:37.320 --> 49:39.320
to individuals to

49:39.320 --> 49:41.320
intraviduals when living in our complex

49:41.320 --> 49:43.320
digital worlds.

49:43.320 --> 49:45.320
Anthropology as I understand

49:45.320 --> 49:47.320
our crafty discipline is bound

49:47.320 --> 49:49.320
to empirical insights

49:49.320 --> 49:51.320
but as well to theoretical concepts

49:51.320 --> 49:53.320
no matter how much we put empirical

49:53.320 --> 49:55.320
fields in our inventory powers at the

49:55.320 --> 49:57.320
center and it matters what thoughts

49:57.320 --> 49:59.320
I am thinking and with whom I am

49:59.320 --> 50:01.320
thinking my thoughts with as Donna

50:01.320 --> 50:03.320
Haraway reminds us.

50:03.320 --> 50:05.320
No matter how much we understand

50:05.320 --> 50:07.320
the discursive structures of truthful

50:07.320 --> 50:09.320
dispositions, no matter how much we

50:09.320 --> 50:11.320
are tricked by unconscious drives

50:11.320 --> 50:13.320
language is the trickster

50:13.320 --> 50:15.320
and sound can play with meaning.

50:15.320 --> 50:17.320
Alterity is key

50:17.320 --> 50:19.320
the rhythm changes everything

50:19.320 --> 50:21.320
communication is misunderstanding

50:21.320 --> 50:23.320
and eps cons from economies

50:23.320 --> 50:25.320
of growth. Alterity

50:25.320 --> 50:27.320
is key.

50:27.320 --> 50:29.320
Thinking about a future that does

50:29.320 --> 50:31.320
not forget where we are coming from

50:31.320 --> 50:33.320
but understands the horizons

50:33.320 --> 50:35.320
of our Indo-European spatiotemporal

50:35.320 --> 50:37.320
housings and movements.

50:37.320 --> 50:39.320
So where we and how we talk

50:39.320 --> 50:41.320
and how we frame things

50:41.320 --> 50:43.320
allows us to recalibrate our own

50:43.320 --> 50:45.320
being on the planet and asks

50:45.320 --> 50:47.320
how we transform from humans into

50:47.320 --> 50:49.320
something we could consider as Terrence.

50:49.320 --> 50:51.320
Since I am convinced that

50:51.320 --> 50:53.320
at the core of our problems within

50:53.320 --> 50:55.320
the Anthropocene lies our ways

50:55.320 --> 50:57.320
of how we perceive space, time and

50:57.320 --> 50:59.320
materiality and that is very closely

50:59.320 --> 51:01.320
tied to our Indo-European language

51:01.320 --> 51:03.320
system. There are other ways

51:03.320 --> 51:05.320
to be in the future and we

51:05.320 --> 51:07.320
as anthropologists are looking for

51:07.320 --> 51:09.320
traces that lead us there.

51:09.320 --> 51:11.320
I want to visualize this

51:11.320 --> 51:13.320
by sharing with you some diagrams

51:13.320 --> 51:15.320
I made. One inspired through

51:15.320 --> 51:17.320
re-reading Nikolai Sorin-Tchaikov's

51:17.320 --> 51:19.320
Two Lenins, a brief anthropology of time

51:19.320 --> 51:21.320
and the other contemporary

51:21.320 --> 51:23.320
works in anthropology that

51:23.320 --> 51:25.320
I try to engage with

51:25.320 --> 51:27.320
two

51:27.320 --> 51:29.320
philosophers that I really admire

51:29.320 --> 51:31.320
very much, Maurice Meloponte

51:31.320 --> 51:33.320
and Jacques Derrida.

51:33.320 --> 51:35.320
So in this you can actually

51:35.320 --> 51:37.320
see it's like a babushka model

51:37.320 --> 51:39.320
an onion model of how

51:39.320 --> 51:41.320
we are engaging

51:41.320 --> 51:43.320
with temporalities and there are different

51:43.320 --> 51:45.320
ideas of temporality. There's the geopolitical

51:45.320 --> 51:47.320
temporality or time that you see

51:47.320 --> 51:49.320
on the outside in the black

51:49.320 --> 51:51.320
frame and then there's the violet frame

51:51.320 --> 51:53.320
you could say it's a media technological

51:53.320 --> 51:55.320
dispositive or apparatus

51:55.320 --> 51:57.320
that is also creating a certain

51:57.320 --> 51:59.320
temporality and rhythm.

51:59.320 --> 52:01.320
These rhythms are going along with each other

52:01.320 --> 52:03.320
they create already a certain resonance

52:03.320 --> 52:05.320
a certain form of harmony. Then you have

52:05.320 --> 52:07.320
a certain temporality, the thought

52:07.320 --> 52:09.320
styles and the epistemic ways

52:09.320 --> 52:11.320
of being together so different thought

52:11.320 --> 52:13.320
collectives to put it with Ludwig Fleck

52:13.320 --> 52:15.320
who have again their own temporality

52:15.320 --> 52:17.320
and then you have the yellow

52:17.320 --> 52:19.320
frame which is the experimental time

52:19.320 --> 52:21.320
so time of the experiment of the Large Hadron Collider

52:21.320 --> 52:23.320
where a certain amount of data is taking

52:23.320 --> 52:25.320
within the time and the fourth

52:25.320 --> 52:27.320
is actually the knowledge that is

52:27.320 --> 52:29.320
coming out of this so the gift

52:29.320 --> 52:31.320
of nature that is appearing

52:31.320 --> 52:33.320
within the collision of the experiment

52:33.320 --> 52:35.320
itself. So all these different

52:35.320 --> 52:37.320
layers of temporality are intersecting

52:37.320 --> 52:39.320
and in between you have the materiality

52:39.320 --> 52:41.320
that maybe cuts and you have the

52:41.320 --> 52:43.320
politics that happening and that's the rhythm

52:43.320 --> 52:45.320
and that's the bead itself

52:45.320 --> 52:47.320
that actually is so interesting to

52:47.320 --> 52:49.320
understand and to describe in anthropology

52:49.320 --> 52:51.320
itself.

52:51.320 --> 52:53.320
And on the other hand

52:53.320 --> 52:55.320
you can see here that's a very classical

52:55.320 --> 52:57.320
imaginary actually

52:57.320 --> 52:59.320
how Maurice Maloponte tried to

52:59.320 --> 53:01.320
show how the past is an

53:01.320 --> 53:03.320
overlay, it's overlaid

53:03.320 --> 53:05.320
by different present times.

53:05.320 --> 53:07.320
So you have here

53:07.320 --> 53:09.320
the black

53:09.320 --> 53:11.320
and red line which is

53:11.320 --> 53:13.320
the timeline, the physical timeline

53:13.320 --> 53:15.320
and that we have in the Newtonian

53:15.320 --> 53:17.320
world and the blue

53:17.320 --> 53:19.320
lines are actually the cuts

53:19.320 --> 53:21.320
of the now when you go back

53:21.320 --> 53:23.320
and the black lines that go

53:23.320 --> 53:25.320
diagonal

53:25.320 --> 53:27.320
through the blue lines are showing that

53:27.320 --> 53:29.320
actually each spot when you would

53:29.320 --> 53:31.320
go into the past are an overlay

53:31.320 --> 53:33.320
of endlessly amounts of

53:33.320 --> 53:35.320
past time points of the now

53:35.320 --> 53:37.320
so that shows what I said initially

53:37.320 --> 53:39.320
how complex the capturing

53:39.320 --> 53:41.320
of the past actually is for historiography.

53:41.320 --> 53:43.320
And on the other hand

53:43.320 --> 53:45.320
when you do physics and we do this

53:45.320 --> 53:47.320
hermeneutical cuts as anthropologists

53:47.320 --> 53:49.320
and the historians when we are

53:49.320 --> 53:51.320
looking into the past.

53:51.320 --> 53:53.320
But on the other hand, physicists are trying

53:53.320 --> 53:55.320
to push this kind of

53:55.320 --> 53:57.320
experience, space of experience

53:57.320 --> 53:59.320
when they simulate experiments

53:59.320 --> 54:01.320
beforehand

54:01.320 --> 54:03.320
and push the experiential space

54:03.320 --> 54:05.320
of the experiment into the future

54:05.320 --> 54:07.320
and have these two

54:07.320 --> 54:09.320
horizons. On the one hand

54:09.320 --> 54:11.320
the horizon of theory and on the other hand

54:11.320 --> 54:13.320
the horizon of the experiment itself.

54:13.320 --> 54:15.320
And to see this kind of

54:15.320 --> 54:17.320
congruence with between thinking how

54:17.320 --> 54:19.320
physicists and computer science

54:19.320 --> 54:21.320
actually makes us and allows us to rethink

54:21.320 --> 54:23.320
the horizons of future is

54:23.320 --> 54:25.320
something that I find very fruitful for my own

54:25.320 --> 54:27.320
discipline and where I learned a lot of

54:27.320 --> 54:29.320
physics and computer science and such.

54:31.320 --> 54:33.320
I did this to remind at the end

54:33.320 --> 54:35.320
of this talk diagrammatically that it does not

54:35.320 --> 54:37.320
only matter with whom we are thinking

54:37.320 --> 54:39.320
thoughts with but also what kind of

54:39.320 --> 54:41.320
geometries, architectures, diagrams

54:41.320 --> 54:43.320
and compositions we build when we approach

54:43.320 --> 54:45.320
any phenomenon including the

54:45.320 --> 54:47.320
futures and futurities.

54:47.320 --> 54:49.320
And also in order to question whether some of

54:49.320 --> 54:51.320
the new materialist

54:51.320 --> 54:53.320
conceptions about future are actually

54:53.320 --> 54:55.320
that new.

54:55.320 --> 54:57.320
Karen Barad's quantum mechanically inspired

54:57.320 --> 54:59.320
concept of interaction harmonizes

54:59.320 --> 55:01.320
with historiographical theories

55:01.320 --> 55:03.320
very well who by definition

55:03.320 --> 55:05.320
aim to reconsider space, time, materiality

55:05.320 --> 55:07.320
humans and non-humans alike

55:07.320 --> 55:09.320
and how things come into being.

55:09.320 --> 55:11.320
When it comes to study futures

55:11.320 --> 55:13.320
we need to work with what we have now

55:13.320 --> 55:15.320
and what we find here.

55:15.320 --> 55:17.320
We are not living in eternal time-free

55:17.320 --> 55:19.320
space a place the Greeks called

55:19.320 --> 55:21.320
Koura filled with eternal

55:21.320 --> 55:23.320
Aion, the Ian, the eternal.

55:23.320 --> 55:25.320
We are mortals in this whole game

55:25.320 --> 55:27.320
depending on chance, kairos,

55:27.320 --> 55:29.320
luck. No matter how much we travel

55:29.320 --> 55:31.320
beyond space and time.

55:31.320 --> 55:33.320
At CERN I observed solitary beings of all

55:33.320 --> 55:35.320
kind interacting and becoming

55:35.320 --> 55:37.320
solitary beings which brings me

55:37.320 --> 55:39.320
back to the tree I observed 12 years ago

55:39.320 --> 55:41.320
in Vienna. The observer

55:41.320 --> 55:43.320
me in the window acknowledged exclusive

55:43.320 --> 55:45.320
moments of each leaf but

55:45.320 --> 55:47.320
the summer wind just as historical time

55:47.320 --> 55:49.320
touched all of us.

55:49.320 --> 55:51.320
As part of one tree these leaves

55:51.320 --> 55:53.320
are part of one universal.

55:53.320 --> 55:55.320
I as observer was audience.

55:55.320 --> 55:57.320
We together were a many world

55:57.320 --> 55:59.320
already. I listened

55:59.320 --> 56:01.320
to the sound of leaves

56:01.320 --> 56:03.320
they brought me to CERN

56:03.320 --> 56:05.320
and this place to understand what our task

56:05.320 --> 56:07.320
in virtue as anthropologists is

56:07.320 --> 56:09.320
when we are doing fieldwork.

56:09.320 --> 56:11.320
That we are sniffling futures.

56:11.320 --> 56:13.320
Our binding leaves through words and finding

56:13.320 --> 56:15.320
traces with forests by summoning

56:15.320 --> 56:17.320
space and time without

56:17.320 --> 56:19.320
imperial aims by piecing fragments

56:19.320 --> 56:21.320
together a part into a unitary

56:21.320 --> 56:23.320
multiplicity.

56:23.320 --> 56:25.320
The modernity, the individual, the

56:25.320 --> 56:27.320
digitality and the future

56:27.320 --> 56:29.320
is about individual individuality.

56:29.320 --> 56:31.320
Is the old blind

56:31.320 --> 56:33.320
in the anthropocene?

56:33.320 --> 56:35.320
Today, anthropology

56:35.320 --> 56:37.320
no matter what field it engage in

56:37.320 --> 56:39.320
is an historically aware discipline.

56:39.320 --> 56:41.320
That's why it's about

56:41.320 --> 56:43.320
when you think of current debates on

56:43.320 --> 56:45.320
restitution of artifacts

56:45.320 --> 56:47.320
stolen within colonial context maybe this

56:47.320 --> 56:49.320
happens also in Brussels. It matters

56:49.320 --> 56:51.320
how you gather your knowledge

56:51.320 --> 56:53.320
and I do not steal from people at CERN.

56:53.320 --> 56:55.320
They do exactly know what I'm doing there

56:55.320 --> 56:57.320
and they're sharing with me because

56:57.320 --> 56:59.320
they know I care for them and they care for me.

56:59.320 --> 57:01.320
And it's important

57:01.320 --> 57:03.320
to know who has a say or the right

57:03.320 --> 57:05.320
for a history of her own.

57:05.320 --> 57:07.320
For what has happened to the pyramids what will

57:07.320 --> 57:09.320
be. In times of

57:09.320 --> 57:11.320
reconsidering apocal cuts in historical

57:11.320 --> 57:13.320
rhythmizations due to the anthropocene

57:13.320 --> 57:15.320
anthropologists have to roam all fields

57:15.320 --> 57:17.320
as trailblazing tracers.

57:19.320 --> 57:21.320
I presented you scenes of vulnerability

57:21.320 --> 57:23.320
all of them physical, one

57:23.320 --> 57:25.320
material, the screw, the other virtual

57:25.320 --> 57:27.320
the bugs and the third a discursive one

57:27.320 --> 57:29.320
which I framed in the term of

57:29.320 --> 57:31.320
masculinity and subversive actions.

57:31.320 --> 57:33.320
I tell you ethnographic fictions

57:33.320 --> 57:35.320
of science based on empirical

57:35.320 --> 57:37.320
encounters to set your minds in places

57:37.320 --> 57:39.320
to open horizons of experience

57:39.320 --> 57:41.320
to take you along my

57:41.320 --> 57:43.320
storytelling and leave you

57:43.320 --> 57:45.320
to your own horizons of experience

57:45.320 --> 57:47.320
to engage in empathy and taking

57:47.320 --> 57:49.320
the others point of view. For that matters

57:49.320 --> 57:51.320
matters more than any

57:51.320 --> 57:53.320
property or appropriation

57:53.320 --> 57:55.320
in fights, any kind

57:55.320 --> 57:57.320
of neoliberal

57:57.320 --> 57:59.320
dispositive of existence we are actually

57:59.320 --> 58:01.320
all the time treadmilling in.

58:01.320 --> 58:03.320
We anthropologists are collaborators

58:03.320 --> 58:05.320
in exchanges, translators

58:05.320 --> 58:07.320
and voice gippers. We acknowledge

58:07.320 --> 58:09.320
respect and the value of the other

58:09.320 --> 58:11.320
as discipline a priori.

58:11.320 --> 58:13.320
We learned it the hard way

58:13.320 --> 58:15.320
for empathy is the evergreen

58:15.320 --> 58:17.320
of world of many worlds.

58:17.320 --> 58:19.320
Think like a stone long with

58:19.320 --> 58:21.320
Beth Provenelli or like a

58:21.320 --> 58:23.320
margulis.

58:23.320 --> 58:25.320
Think like a mushroom along with

58:25.320 --> 58:27.320
anatzin or like vertebrae

58:27.320 --> 58:29.320
in companionship with Donna Haraway.

58:29.320 --> 58:31.320
See the world from a quantum perspective

58:31.320 --> 58:33.320
together with Karen Barat

58:33.320 --> 58:35.320
but let those things in their

58:35.320 --> 58:37.320
thinness, those beings in their

58:37.320 --> 58:39.320
beingness be themselves and

58:39.320 --> 58:41.320
relate as Helen Verand does.

58:41.320 --> 58:43.320
Take the aliens point of view

58:43.320 --> 58:45.320
and acknowledge the own alien within

58:45.320 --> 58:47.320
yourself. Be an interdependent

58:47.320 --> 58:49.320
member of Arturo Escobar's

58:49.320 --> 58:51.320
pluriverse and acknowledge your

58:51.320 --> 58:53.320
individuality along with the

58:53.320 --> 58:55.320
physicists of my field.

58:55.320 --> 58:57.320
I finished this talk with the

58:57.320 --> 58:59.320
question I would love to discuss with you

58:59.320 --> 59:01.320
and hints of positivist

59:01.320 --> 59:03.320
teleology put aside and

59:03.320 --> 59:05.320
that I learned today to ask in

59:05.320 --> 59:07.320
and through physics. What could

59:07.320 --> 59:09.320
an interdisciplinary

59:09.320 --> 59:11.320
collaboration look like in 21-23

59:11.320 --> 59:13.320
and how would you

59:13.320 --> 59:15.320
folks think an interdisciplinary

59:15.320 --> 59:17.320
collaboration across cultures

59:17.320 --> 59:19.320
of knowledge would be useful

59:19.320 --> 59:21.320
and fruitful.

59:21.320 --> 59:23.320
Thank you very much.

59:25.320 --> 59:27.320
Thank you, Ann.

59:27.320 --> 59:29.320
Is it okay that we close this

59:29.320 --> 59:31.320
screen sure that we see each other?

59:31.320 --> 59:33.320
Everybody sees everybody?

59:33.320 --> 59:35.320
Will it make sense? Okay,

59:35.320 --> 59:37.320
that's nice. Just let me

59:37.320 --> 59:39.320
open this on the...

59:39.320 --> 59:41.320
How do I do that?

59:47.320 --> 59:49.320
Thank you

59:49.320 --> 59:51.320
for your patience.

59:51.320 --> 59:53.320
It was 10 minutes overdue

59:53.320 --> 59:55.320
but I hope you didn't lose the

59:55.320 --> 59:57.320
attention.

59:57.320 --> 59:59.320
We are all here. So who would like

59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.320
to start commenting question?

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.320
Francis. And let's use

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.320
the mic in the row.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.320
Well, I would like to

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.320
make a very provocative statement

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.320
but before I do so

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.320
I will introduce myself in order to make it

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.320
a little bit less provocative.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.320
I'm the director here

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.320
of the Centre-Layer Postal.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.320
I very much agree

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.320
with people like Karen Barat

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.320
about intra-action.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.320
I've been studying quantum mechanics.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.320
I've been developing an ontology

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.320
that I call relational agency

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.320
that can be used for post-humanism.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.320
So I all agree

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.320
about different agency,

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.320
about diversity, about

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.320
the fact that an institute

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.320
like a CERN should be

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.320
as diverse as possible.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.320
But now comes my provocative statement

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.320
that is that your analysis to me

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.320
sounds quite racist

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.320
and sexist

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.320
because you are analysing

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.320
an ordinary event

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.320
a younger junior person

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.320
who points out a mistake in some

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.320
senior person and the senior person

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.320
not immediately picking it up or not

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.320
being very happy to hear about that

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.320
to me that seems like

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.320
general anthropology

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.320
that would happen in any context

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.320
white or black, masculine

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.320
or feminine

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.320
science or non-science

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.320
if some younger member

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.320
of a tribe would question

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.320
an indigenous elder

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:27.320
that would also not be taken as seriously

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.320
what happened to Clare Covert

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.320
as far as I understood was nothing bad

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.320
she just was not immediately

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.320
listened to. I think

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.320
these kind of events happen all the time

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.320
in all circumstances

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.320
that this is a masculine

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.320
white European environment

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.320
is actually making

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.320
a racist and sexist assumption

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.320
namely that in non-white

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.320
non-European, non-masculine

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.320
environments this would not happen

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.320
imagine that you would have said

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.320
this is an environment

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.320
with mostly Jews

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.320
and this thing happened there

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.320
people would immediately tell you

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.320
that you are an anti-Semite

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.320
but if you say they are white European males

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.320
somehow it is considered to be

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.320
non-racist, non-sexist

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.320
well I think it is

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.320
yeah thank you very much

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.320
I think there must be a basic misunderstanding

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.320
because I have been quoting people

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.320
I have been quoting and framing

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.320
what people were saying

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.320
so it's not me who says that

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.320
but it's actually the statement of the people themselves

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.320
they were calling it

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.320
in these terms

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.320
I have been just quoting

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.320
and if you consider rightfully

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.320
this as racist and sexist

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.320
then you have to call out

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.320
these women who

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.320
perceive it that way

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.320
so it's not me, I am just here the modest witness

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.320
of their quotations

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:51.320
and what was of concern to them

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.320
you could

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.320
definitely push this back

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.320
and I perceive this also

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.320
as a pushback

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.320
but

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.320
I just can tell you

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.320
this is just one little piece

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.320
of data of many many many

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.320
and

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.320
if people from the US

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.320
would perceive a certain style

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.320
of reasoning in Europe predominant

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.320
and voice this in

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.320
records it's not me who came up with this

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.320
it's not me who

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:23.320
is bringing this into

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.320
so yes it is racist

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.320
yes it is sexist but that's

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.320
the data of the people

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.320
and not my own quotation

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.320
and if people are perceiving

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.320
what you were saying this is something

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.320
if you downplaying actually you are downplaying

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.320
Claire

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.320
because for Claire this was very traumatic

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.320
and she is a PhD student

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.320
and that really concerned her

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.320
and I have been spending time with her

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.320
sitting at the restaurant and many people have spent time

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.320
with her and she couldn't sleep

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.320
and she had heart race beating

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.320
very strongly

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.320
to meet this person

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.320
that she was frightened on because he would really scream

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.320
within the team meetings

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.320
and so

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.320
actually I just perceive

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.320
I don't think that you just simply got

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.320
the initial

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.320
thing I'm on your side

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.320
but actually that's the data

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.320
if you say this is not this is something very

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.320
common she has been hurt she had to plot

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.320
and if you're

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.320
then I have to say to you provocatively

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.320
that you actually take the master's perspective

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.320
of the head of an institution

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.320
who is not seeing how those

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.320
people who are servants behind your back

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.320
are actually playing you all the time

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.320
that would be my

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.320
provocative reply to you because

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.320
really that's not my data that's not my words

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.320
that's not my framing that's the framing of the people

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.320
I have been working with and that's not

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.320
a tribe

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.320
that is calling out in elderly

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.320
but these are physicists and that's

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.320
a quite a reductionist

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.320
comparison

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.320
and also playing down the complexities

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.320
of what we call and do not anymore

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.320
actually called tribal societies

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.320
sorry

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.320
well I

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.320
I believe that what you described

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.320
that I very much understand that

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:07.320
somebody would be traumatized I have

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.320
had similar experiences

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.320
both in the case of myself

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.320
not being listened to

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.320
by an elderly when I was younger

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.320
and vice versa

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.320
I think these things happen all the time

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.320
and they are traumatic but they are part

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.320
of human nature

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.320
implying that it's only

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.320
white males who do it I think is

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.320
very unrealistic

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.320
the white males it will be

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.320
we are on the same side

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.320
my dear I also do not think

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.320
that it's just like a male white thing

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.320
that's how these people perceive it

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.320
and that's interesting as a symptom

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.320
doesn't mean that it's the reality

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.320
that's how these people perceive it

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.320
and actually the question is

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.320
why do they perceive it that way

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.320
why do young women in physics

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.320
perceive it this way

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.320
why would they actually

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.320
be sexist and call it out

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.320
and we have

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.320
also at CERN there's something we call

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.320
the queen bee phenomenon

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.320
you maybe know it from physics or from any other field

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.320
so it's saying that there are few

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.320
women who have come up in leading positions

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.320
and they are queen bees

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.320
that means they can work very well together with

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.320
men but not so well with women

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:17.320
and they are killing other bee queens

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.320
and at CERN you could study

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.320
for example also very well the queen bee phenomenon

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.320
and

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.320
as I just said that's the death question

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.320
and I just provocatively

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.320
provocatively put it into you

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.320
but

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.320
as the so-called

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.320
diversity and

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.320
gender equality representative

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.320
of the philosophical faculty of my university

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.320
I can tell you women

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.320
and men play the same games and it doesn't matter

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.320
what kind of religion, race, class

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.320
ethnicity they have as a background

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:49.320
doesn't matter

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.320
but still that's the sources and CERN

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.320
has to deal with this

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.320
and also what I find

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.320
interesting and you know that's not what I want to talk about

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.320
what I find interesting is the more interesting part

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.320
is to put this

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.320
aside and get away

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.320
from this kind of how they perceive it

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.320
be it the capital M guy

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.320
and blaming men and blaming whiteness

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.320
whatever I don't care I just

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.320
don't think that's useful for us

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.320
what I found fascinating is how she actually

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.320
tries to solve a problem

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.320
and steps back from

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.320
her individual perspective

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.320
acknowledges there's a certain leading figure

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.320
who cannot step away

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.320
from his individual's narcissist needs

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.320
and becomes an

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.320
individual playing along

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.320
with other people together

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.320
to come to a common goal and to reach it

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.320
as you did when you were actually young

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.320
and that's something where I think

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.320
what you initially called the relational agency

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.320
and the post humanist

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.320
diversity that you're engaging with

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.320
is something that you actually embodied

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:49.320
as a sensitive young

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.320
man who did research and experienced

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:53.320
the same traumatic downplaying

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.320
as Claire in her case

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.320
gendered in your case not gendered

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.320
well in my case

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.320
actually I have been downplayed

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.320
by women professors when I was young

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.320
but so I don't mind

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.320
it doesn't matter the gender

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.320
is not relevant everybody plays these

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.320
political games as soon as they get in

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.320
a position of power

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.320
I really don't think that

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.320
whiteness, Europeaness

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.320
or gender plays a role

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.320
all situations where there is

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.320
an ability to move up in

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.320
a power hierarchy they play political games

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.320
which means that the ones at the higher level

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:31.320
of the hierarchy don't like to be

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.320
criticised by the ones lower on

01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.320
it's universal I don't think it needs

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.320
to be gendered or Europeanized

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.320
or muscularized or whatever

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:41.320
you have to say this

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.320
to the people I did research with

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.320
and not to me I mean like that's not my point

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:47.320
it's not I

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.320
I don't think that it has to be gendered

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.320
I just said to you I think

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.320
it doesn't matter who does this people love

01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:55.320
power plays no matter

01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.320
but then that's the

01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:59.320
data I just gathered

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.320
it's the data it's not me

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.320
I'm just

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:05.320
the modest witness here and that's the part

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.320
of the field that I didn't construct but I try

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:09.320
to show you as an anthropologist is actually

01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:10.320
how

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.320
individuality comes into being

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.320
how although hierarchy is

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.320
preventing a certain functioning

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.320
individual interacting

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.320
and engagement in your times

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.320
a relational agency

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:24.320
is allowing that things at the end work out

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.320
so

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.320
so we have 40s and then

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.320
Schema 40s

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.320
I cannot

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:48.320
40s you are muted

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:51.320
not connected to Mike

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.320
so

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.320
okay so maybe we move to Schema

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.320
and meanwhile you will figure it out okay

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.320
for this

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.320
can you hear me

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.320
yes yes

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.320
thank you very much for your

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.320
interesting presentation

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.320
I wonder if you

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.320
can elaborate a little bit on

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:20.320
some sort of like incentive models

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.320
that you think can be put into place

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.320
for promoting

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.320
this kind of like

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.320
intra individualization

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.320
especially in interdisciplinary research

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.320
because most of the problems we are facing right now

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.320
you rightly also mentioned

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.320
in your presentation

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.320
are so complex that I think

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.320
we need to move toward this kind of

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.320
perspective

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.320
though I also want to say like

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.320
some part of like this

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.320
profile of mail

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.320
I think it's kind of present

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.320
in some disciplines

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.320
especially like STEM sciences I'm coming from

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.320
that background

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.320
I can see why these women probably

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.320
would witness this kind of like incidents

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.320
do I want to move

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.320
toward this kind of incentive models

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.320
like what kind of environment

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.320
what kind of like

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.320
team or

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.320
arrangements

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.320
should be put into place from your research

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.320
that can kind of promote

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.320
this kind of

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.320
approach and at the same time

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.320
if this is

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.320
like power dynamic

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.320
dynamics emerge from

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.320
somebody having more experiences

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.320
or having a different socio

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.320
technological

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.320
social background

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.320
what kind of like mechanisms

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.320
needs to be in place to prevent

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.320
the

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.320
power dynamics taking over

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.320
positive

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.320
collaborations thank you very much

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.320
thank you Shima

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.320
for these very fundamental questions

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.320
and I have been dealing with these questions myself

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.320
I just I hope

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.320
I can give you some of those

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.320
my thoughts that I think that would be useful

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.320
but that's just like hypothetical

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.320
what I would wish

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.320
so the good thing and the good news

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.320
about CERN is that it works very well

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.320
and what they did actually that it works

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.320
is that they were implementing

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.320
game theory elements

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.320
so certain type of competitiveness

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.320
within the work collaborations

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.320
and there are different styles

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.320
the Atlas collaboration who is

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.320
flatter in its hierarchy

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.320
and there's the CMS collaboration

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.320
which is more competitive and more hierarchical

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.320
so even there there are differences of course

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.320
and there are more or less

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.320
hierarchical

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.320
correlations and situations

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.320
so one cannot give one solution to all

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.320
and this kind of specific

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.320
sample that you showed I showed to you

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.320
is an example of I don't like

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.320
the term but I use it of a toxic

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.320
work group so a work group that doesn't function well

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.320
but of course there are also

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.320
work groups that function well

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.320
and I studied these work groups where it functioned well

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.320
when did it function well

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.320
it functioned well when first

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.320
there was a good communication between

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.320
the authority figures

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.320
the so-called leaders of the teams

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.320
and the PhD students and the early postdocs

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.320
and that was always

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.320
the case when the team leaders were

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.320
still also being part

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.320
of the programming

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:14.320
and also engaged in the

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.320
updates and upgrades and constantly

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.320
tried to go

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.320
along with the time so not becoming

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.320
just older and experience in politics

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.320
but also still knowing what

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.320
actually the younger ones doing when programming

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.320
and solving the problems on the code

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.320
so it actually asks

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.320
from the authority figures to say close

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.320
to what the younger ones do

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.320
that's one side and the other side

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.320
what I think that would be really good

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.320
on the long run would be

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.320
actually

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.320
a certain form of

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.320
social

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.320
therapeutic work groups where people are able

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.320
to say what they actually feel like

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.320
because if you ask

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.320
the guy that Claire

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.320
is calling out who is

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.320
problematic and who is this

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.320
authority figure that she says

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.320
it's a white male guy of Europe

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.320
if you ask this guy

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.320
who I think by his origin is German

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.320
if you ask this guy why he's

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.320
so choleric and screaming all the time

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.320
and cannot allow mistakes

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.320
cannot admit mistakes

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.320
you might see if he would

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.320
have time that he would say oh I have so

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.320
much responsibility to take

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.320
nobody listens to me I feel

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.320
I'm lost here I'm overworked there

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.320
and so on and so on so actually

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.320
it's a certain mode of taking

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.320
back which I would think would be very

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.320
useful for everybody of us working in

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.320
science and at universities

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.320
in general and that's something that's

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.320
missing a certain form of

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.320
mediation a certain form of

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:42.320
acknowledging the others that's what I also said at the

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.320
end you know listening to the other person

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.320
taking the other one's point of view also

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.320
what now the director

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.320
of Claire was saying I mean like what

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.320
you're saying is exactly what I wish

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.320
would be something that would be

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.320
implemented so this kind of

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.320
contained groups where people

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.320
could work with each other

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.320
so I think that would be something

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.320
as a that

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.320
would need to be implemented because

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.320
the pressure is so high

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.320
and on the other hand

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.320
what's very interesting and I think what would

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.320
be very useful is if you talk to people at CERN

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.320
I did talk to the psychologists at CERN

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.320
and if and

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.320
they have records they do not get everybody

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.320
but they have statistics

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.320
of the amount of anxieties of sleeplessness

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.320
as a really like

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.320
psychological psychosomatic

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.320
symptoms that appear within

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.320
a certain

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.320
high level research

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.320
environment and

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.320
I think what would really help to just

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.320
use all the technologies we have

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.320
from psychological therapeutics

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.320
to just implement this as mandatory

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.320
way of self-care

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.320
and also group care and then it would

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.320
definitely work better

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.320
but when it comes to the

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.320
fundamental exclusion of

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.320
certain groups who are privileged

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.320
or less privileged

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.320
then it really needs at least in the

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.320
German case we would need definitely

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.320
to support more people from working class

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.320
environments and so on from early on

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:08.320
and to change the whole curriculum

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.320
from early on to have a different standpoint

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.320
of how

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.320
those STEM fields are

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.320
taught

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.320
I hope this answers a little bit Shima

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.320
could you give me a small feedback

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.320
whether this is a bit helpful

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.320
Yes, it's very interesting

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.320
thank you very much for

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.320
an elaborate answer

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.320
I think

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.320
what I see is that probably

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.320
the kind of mix of highly competitive

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.320
environments and

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.320
I think to some extent also

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.320
maybe so more men

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.320
are actually present in STEM fields

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.320
this is kind of like statistics are out there

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.320
nobody can basically

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.320
ignore them more men are actually

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.320
attracted to these fields

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.320
not just because the field

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.320
promotes men I think it's kind of

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.320
something that is there are so many

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.320
complex reasons that are happening

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.320
that are there that actually causing

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.320
women

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.320
choosing other fields rather than STEM

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.320
fields and I think

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.320
in any kind of field when you have

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.320
this proportionate gender representation

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.320
you can get into some sort of

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.320
like a maladaptive

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.320
dynamics so I think

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.320
this is kind of like

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.320
promoting more women and I think

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.320
what you mentioned I think listening is very

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:24.320
important I really liked what you mentioned

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.320
bringing more of these

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.320
critical skills like listening, empathy

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.320
and putting yourself in somebody

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.320
else's perspective is I think so fundamental

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.320
in technical fields

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.320
and thank you very much for your

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.320
very interesting presentation

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.320
thank you

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.320
Thank you Shima, just one little thing I want to add

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.320
I asked the leading also

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.320
the director general

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.320
back then at CERN and others

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.320
how they actually deal with this problem

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.320
and they are not very happy that they have just 20%

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.320
women at CERN

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.320
and the problem is that they also

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.320
have just 20% students

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.320
coming to physics

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.320
also it's like the problem

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.320
starts in school

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.320
and they say

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.320
they would love to have more

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.320
female and that's again

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.320
quite sexist as a statement when you think

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.320
about that in the backdrop

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.320
because they say women are

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.320
tending to care more

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.320
active and care more

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.320
about the experiment while males

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.320
are more interested in their own

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.320
success

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.320
so that's also a self description

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.320
which I found

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.320
super sexist and that's

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.320
what I found also very interesting

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.320
and I think that's the point where you nailed

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.320
it is so impressive

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.320
when you go to a place like CERN

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.320
where people really highly fight

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.320
to have a diverse

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.320
reality

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.320
at the end of the day

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.320
it becomes again

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.320
ethnicist, essentializing

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.320
and sexist and racist

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.320
and it even comes to the point

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.320
where Italians are cooking

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.320
their food and the Russians

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.320
are sticking together with

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.320
the Russians and the Bulgarians

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.320
are having their Bulgarian meeting

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.320
and so on and so on

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.320
it's really fascinating how people deal with this

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.320
in a cosmopolitan space

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.320
that has actually the goal

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.320
of a space gender

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.320
sex class

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.320
that do not matter

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.320
and I think that's

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.320
important because if you have

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.320
an ideal of relational

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.320
agency and of a post human

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.320
diversity

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.320
then in a way it's a universal

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:34.320
goal

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.320
it's a universal hope

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.320
and any universalist

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.320
approach

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.320
is fragmented

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.320
and it becomes a plurality

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.320
when you go to a certain

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.320
specific place and I think that's something

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.320
that I also try to make visible

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.320
and if you are producing these kind

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.320
of individual certain

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.320
communities then you actually could solve

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.320
these problems and I really hope

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.320
that we come to another solution

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.320
because we need different community models

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.320
we need different work models

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.320
because this kind of neoliberal work system

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.320
isn't healthy for anybody of us

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.320
and it will come, it has to come

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.320
at a certain point to end

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.320
maybe not in my lifetime but I hope

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.320
that I will still witness this

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.320
Thank you. For this, how is your sound now?

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.320
There is a message

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.320
Do you want to ask a question now?

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.320
You can hear me!

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.320
Oh, fantastic! I don't know what I have done

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.320
now I think it's already

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.320
past you

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.320
so I'm not going to ask

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.320
any question now, it's already been

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.320
addressed

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.320
No, please Hothis, you cannot

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.320
leave me that way, I feel like I'm sticking with you

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.320
I was wondering whether you have

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.320
ways of being of James Brittle

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.320
No

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.320
He's telling exactly the same thing you are

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.320
but

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.320
from another point of view he's also

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.320
read Barat

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.320
which I will receive

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.320
for Christmas on the tree

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.320
and

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.320
actually

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.320
he's trying to come to the same kind of

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.320
understanding but not on the academic level

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.320
but

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.320
at the post-human level

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.320
the world

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.320
with

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.320
not viewed from humans only

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.320
but to include everybody

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.320
everything

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.320
and to have

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.320
an idea of

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.320
how to find solutions to the fact that

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.320
everything is so binary

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.320
so that's also what's been

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.320
the point of this discussion

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.320
because it's very binary

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.320
it's male-female but you have

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.320
nobody is entirely male and entirely

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.320
female so you already have

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.320
different

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.320
ways of being

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.320
and he wants

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.320
he was talking about

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.320
having computers thinking

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.320
otherwise than binary

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.320
but he's not very concrete about it

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.320
so I don't know whether

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.320
at CERN there because I also

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.320
understood from his book that

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.320
also the computers

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.320
well the computer models they are using

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.320
at CERN are this carol

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.320
Monte Carlo

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:20.320
theory based so

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.320
actually they are based on

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.320
chance

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.320
and uncertainty so

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.320
I was wondering if they are thinking

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.320
about something else as computers

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.320
which might be more developed

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.320
than

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.320
whatever he points out in his book

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.320
no they don't

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.320
it works very well

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.320
and they are working very precisely

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:44.320
with their machine learning

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.320
algorithms and the Monte Carlo simulations

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:48.320
it's really astonishing what they are doing there actually

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.320
it's really amazing

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.320
what they are producing there

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.320
yeah but you are looking

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.320
again we are looking at uncertainty

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.320
yes they approximate

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:00.320
they approximate it

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:02.320
and that's where also the playfulness came into being

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.320
that's why I deal a lot with playing games

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.320
because they have lots of rules

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.320
and uncertainty and chance of playing along

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.320
but they are not looking for another

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.320
system beyond the binary model

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.320
they are not working on this

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.320
it's not their topic

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.320
would be maybe something they could engage with

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.320
but they are much more interested currently

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.320
in medical applications

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.320
of what they are doing because it's very useful

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.320
for example fighting cancer and so on

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.320
so that's something

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.320
they look into and also

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.320
saving energy

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.320
it's something they are really interested in

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.320
because CERN uses a lot of energy

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.320
but also has to deal with the energy problem

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.320
it tries to find solutions

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.320
so many people are engaging there thinking to solve that problem

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.320
also fighting fake news

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.320
it's something that is very important to them

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:48.320
and also what is a fun fact

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.320
is the Claire

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.320
that I interviewed later on

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.320
she came out as non-binary

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.320
I didn't say it in that moment

01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.320
because she has been read as female

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.320
and she has been talking a lot about this

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.320
but later on she came out as non-binary

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.320
so non-binary is more

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.320
exists at CERN

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.320
but

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.320
I was very much fascinated

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.320
when I entered the STEM field

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.320
how much all of this

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.320
matters still

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.320
even if I wish it wouldn't

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.320
and also I think that

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.320
what I try to

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.320
what is very clear from you

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.320
is that it really doesn't

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.320
that's why I talked about Terrence

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.320
instead of humans

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.320
it is that there are alliances

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.320
and I'm really putting aside

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:38.320
the humans along with the algorithms

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.320
with the computer

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.320
or with a bug and so on

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.320
and I think that's very interesting

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.320
also to think along that way

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:48.320
and to step out of this

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.320
and from a physicist's perspective

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.320
you can start us, right?

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.320
Well, yes

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.320
That's clear

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.320
Thank you, Rockwantum

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.320
Yeah

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.320
Anna, thank you for your presentation

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.320
I just missed a part of the

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.320
discussion before as my internet

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.320
went down

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.320
I also want to say

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.320
Centro Karsch from Thomas

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.320
because he had an urgent meeting

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.320
to make it

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.320
but I was just thinking that

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.320
you just mentioned about

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.320
sort of this both humanist

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.320
perspective or maybe transhumanist

01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:30.320
I don't know if you would call it

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.320
a sort of transhumanist perspective

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.320
like having also algorithms

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.320
and

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.320
hardware as an

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.320
equal being

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.320
Well, that's sometimes quite difficult

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.320
especially when talking about

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.320
AI or maybe advanced technologies

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.320
that sometimes these types

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.320
of human-made

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.320
artifacts are placed

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.320
above

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.320
or more there still

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:58.320
seems to be a hierarchy

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.320
that people are talking within these

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:02.320
sectors like

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.320
within STEM sectors

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.320
there seems to be a bit of a bias

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.320
between

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.320
technology and certain minorities

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:14.320
Do you sort of

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.320
what's your perspective on that?

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.320
My perspective on that

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:20.320
is now I give you a very fun

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:22.320
like please take this with a

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.320
big grain of irony

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:26.320
so in the 1970s

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.320
physics came

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.320
to a certain end

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.320
epistemically and technologically

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.320
and also as you might know

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.320
lots of

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.320
physicists were trained

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.320
and then there were many people who didn't have a job

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.320
but there was LSD

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.320
and there were other drugs

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.320
that allowed them to think further

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.320
and they really took these drugs and then Apple came

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.320
into being and many other funny things

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.320
like for example string theory

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.320
and I think what you describe right now is

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.320
a time where we are living in a

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.320
hyper realistic time

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.320
where these kind of mind expanding

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.320
experiences where you understand

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.320
as when people

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.320
who have taken LSD they would always describe

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.320
this kind of we are one world

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.320
and this postal humanist perspective is something

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.320
that they are really seeing when they

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.320
are taking these kind of

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.320
mushroom derivatives

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.320
that we are living

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.320
in a time where we're coming through technology

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.320
and that's fascinating to the same point

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.320
because the transhumanist perspective

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.320
and the post humanist terminology

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.320
emerged by Andrew Pickering and others

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:30.320
who studied in the 1990s physics

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.320
high energy physics

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:34.320
and what you describe in the hierarchy

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.320
I think is still a narcissist mirroring

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.320
so they look at the stuff they created

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:40.320
and since they want to be

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.320
big and taller than they are

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.320
actually they make what they

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.320
created bigger and taller as it

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.320
actually is and I think

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.320
this will all be played

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:52.320
unfortunately due to the climate

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.320
crisis we are experiencing

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.320
and all the augmenting crisis

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.320
this will be put into place

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.320
and I am at this point

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.320
very how should I say

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.320
guarded optimistic

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.320
that although we are undergoing

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.320
these kind of challenges and undergoing

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.320
these kind of crazy fights

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:12.320
of identity

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.320
politics that I personally do not like

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.320
at all and people who

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.320
would be racist and

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.320
would be sexist and would be techno

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.320
optimist and so on say yes

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.320
we go to the Mars and so on

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.320
that we are coming back to a

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.320
perspective where what you're

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.320
following at the clear

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:32.320
is actually the future and that's

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.320
something that I'm also working on that's why I'm very

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.320
grateful that you invited me because

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.320
we are working on the same

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.320
topic and people around the world

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.320
are doing what you do what I

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:44.320
do and that's something where we have

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.320
to stick together and sometimes

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.320
we might have to go into subversion

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:50.320
and we have to use it to play

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.320
like Claire played the dominant

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.320
ruling society we're living

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.320
in but I think that at the

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:58.320
end of the day we will come to that point

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.320
and I really hope

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.320
for that one of when the research

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.320
that you do will also contribute

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.320
to that bigger goal

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.320
Thanks Anne, I hope so

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.320
I hope so as well

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.320
it will be this interesting thing

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.320
to touch on, thank you

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.320
I also feel like

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.320
in education or sort of

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.320
this identity politics

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.320
that even like through education

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.320
or people choosing a certain

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.320
that also in education there should be

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:32.320
a lot more trans-disciplinarity and I think also

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.320
what you talked about during

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.320
your talk that

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.320
technical people also

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:42.320
need humanities

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.320
sort of this whole

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.320
being able to place

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:48.320
things in a bigger perspective

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:50.320
and perhaps that would, I don't know

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:52.320
if it would help like if you have a trans-disciplinarity

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.320
team of trans-disciplinary

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.320
people that would also maybe

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.320
or that they might

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.320
be more

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.320
able to place themselves in another person

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.320
like be able to sort of see

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.320
or be

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:08.320
sort of mindful about having a different

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.320
perspective or that they are

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.320
biased in a certain way

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.320
or is this something that people need to

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.320
learn or

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.320
become aware of?

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:22.320
Yeah, I totally agree

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:24.320
I think that will be the future and it's hard

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.320
to accept for some

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:28.320
but

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:30.320
and I'm very happy that for example

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:32.320
the Centadio Apostol exists and that you brought it

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:34.320
into being Mr. Director, please excuse me

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:36.320
that I was

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.320
challenging your challenge

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.320
but

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:42.320
I really think that we will have

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.320
these kinds of trends, we need it, we need

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.320
humanities, we need to survive these days

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:48.320
because we are

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.320
not from an economical

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.320
neoliberal perspective, we do not seem

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.320
to be useful but in

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.320
10 to 20 years many computer scientists

01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:58.320
will end up without

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.320
job because AI took their job

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:02.320
and then it comes back to interpretation

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:04.320
and then comes back to the

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:06.320
hermeneutics and then it comes back to the humanities

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.320
and social science because what

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.320
AI is producing is

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.320
boring, mediocre narratives

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:14.320
and when it comes out

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.320
comes to the point where it becomes

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.320
disturbing, where the human factor

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:20.320
plays into, that's something

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:22.320
where we come back into it

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.320
when resoric becomes again

01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:26.320
important and also hermeneutical understanding

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.320
We have one question from the room

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:32.320
and then 40 seconds, okay?

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.320
First of all, thank you for

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:40.320
this interesting talk

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:42.320
Dr. Anne

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.320
my name is Fabrizio

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:46.320
I'm a student

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:48.320
and a PhD student here in CLEA

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.320
and I would like to ask

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.320
the next question

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.320
in a

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.320
disruptive technology where we live

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.320
right now

01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:00.320
I think we could

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:02.320
use the

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:04.320
anthropology in order to

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.320
empower our workers

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.320
or workers

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.320
In your opinion

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.320
how would you use

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.320
the best of anthropology

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.320
in order to improve

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.320
the resilience

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:22.320
of

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.320
supply chains

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:26.320
as you know the supply chain

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:28.320
is a

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.320
group of business

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.320
excellence that are

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.320
integrated in a

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:36.320
network that works in a

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:38.320
like a one system

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:40.320
and that will be my question

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:42.320
how would you use the

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:44.320
best of anthropology

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:46.320
in order to improve the resilience

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.320
of the supply chain

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.320
thank you

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:52.320
Thank you very much again

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.320
the question is what kind of supply chains should be improved

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.320
some supply chains

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.320
I don't want to have improved

01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:00.320
where I think they are not serving any goals

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:02.320
so whenever it comes to

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:04.320
the logic of growth

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.320
we're coming to an end

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:08.320
and whenever it comes to exploiting the earth

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:10.320
and having this idea that we're taking more

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:12.320
and more out it also comes to an end

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:14.320
because that's what we do also to ourselves

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.320
to the world out

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:18.320
so I think one thing is really to show

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.320
that a certain idea of burnout doesn't work anymore

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.320
burning out the energy

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.320
of ourselves or taking

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:26.320
extracting everything what we could do

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.320
and that's what we should actually cut

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:30.320
or say as anthropologists here as a rupture

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:32.320
that's the end it doesn't work anymore

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.320
we cannot relate anymore to the world

01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.320
and the other would really bring us back

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:38.320
bring us back

01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.320
with technologies of embodiment

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:42.320
with technologies that we

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:44.320
anthropologists when we do field work

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.320
because when we go into another society

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:48.320
and we do

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:50.320
transform we are prepared

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:52.320
and we have technologies to

01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.320
to be resilient ourselves

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.320
to not fall or to survive

01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:58.320
what we call the culture shock

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:00.320
and we experience usually culture shocks

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:02.320
after two months we have the field diary

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.320
we have certain forms of supervision and so on

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:06.320
and we have all of this also

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:08.320
in Europe already developed

01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:10.320
we have a whole apparatus of care

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.320
and I think that's where

01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:14.320
that's where I see a future

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:16.320
and that would also not only

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.320
say in an essential way

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.320
anthropology shows are people

01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:22.320
from Belgium are that way

01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:24.320
and if you're coming from Mexico

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.320
then you have to deal with the Belgians

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:28.320
this way and please Belgians

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:30.320
please acknowledge that you do not understand

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.320
how it feels to lose

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.320
your environment when you're from a

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:36.320
Amazonian society or so something like that

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.320
I think that's

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.320
not something where we are there

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.320
to just mediate or be the

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:44.320
testimonies of other cultures

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:46.320
but what we could do is just really

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.320
relate between the different perspectives

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.320
and help others to see themselves

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.320
I think that would be one possible solution

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:54.320
that's also where art comes into being

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:56.320
and in an ever more

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:58.320
entangled world

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:00.320
where people are coming from

01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:02.320
all over the world to Europe

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.320
and Europe itself

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.320
is turning into deep

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.320
crisis one really has to ask also

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:10.320
what are the laws

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:12.320
the ideals

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.320
and the fights we in Europe have been fighting

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:16.320
and that's the good side also

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:18.320
that's also something I want to say

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.320
but this reasonable European man

01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:22.320
that the Americans criticized

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.320
in this

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:26.320
Fieldburg snippets I presented to you

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.320
on the other hand CERN

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:30.320
is

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:32.320
the outcome of the Second World War

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:34.320
where physicists

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.320
from different nations fought

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.320
against each other

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:40.320
but instead of producing a bomb

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:42.320
they really want to find knowledge

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.320
and they want to show how cosmopolitan

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:46.320
work

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.320
is possible

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:50.320
how you really can pursue a goal

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.320
and I showed you the destructive

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.320
side of this the ruptures the cuts

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:56.320
where it doesn't work

01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:58.320
but that doesn't mean that the ideas

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.320
and the goals that CERN produces

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.320
aren't something that I personally as a European think

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.320
I'm standing for democracy

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.320
the ideal of equality even

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.320
if it's not working criticizing

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:10.320
a certain non-democratic hierarchy

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.320
and so on and so on

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:14.320
so I think that's something that we also

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:16.320
have to do as anthropologists

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:18.320
to say okay that's a certain kind of

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:20.320
standard we have been working on

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.320
and even if we decolonize

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:24.320
everything we have to rethink

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:26.320
what kind of criticism

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:28.320
of colonial power relations

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:30.320
actually brought humanism into being

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:32.320
and where post-humanism

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:34.320
is a child of these kind

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.320
of developments as such

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.320
I hope that somehow

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.320
gives you a little bit of

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.320
an answer to this and I think that would

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:44.320
actually put a resilience to the

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:46.320
what you call supply chains

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.320
or the resilience to certain societies

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.320
that fight for the equality

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.320
of people and fight and have

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:54.320
also attained the equality

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.320
of for example women and men

01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:58.320
or the equality

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.320
of voting no matter what kind

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:02.320
and how much money you have

01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.320
or whether you are aristocrat or not

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.320
What is?

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.320
Yes, so I want to come back

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:12.320
to the question of trans-

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:14.320
trans-civil narrative

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:16.320
so I am doing a PhD

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.320
in philosophy on being

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:20.320
and becoming but it's

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.320
very much based on quantum

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.320
physics so I've been reaching

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.320
out to Rovalli and Tonnelli

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.320
at first

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.320
they

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.320
answered the questions I ask

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.320
and then when I asked

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.320
when they

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:38.320
and Rovalli even said

01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.320
I don't know any philosopher being

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.320
occupied with

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.320
quantum physics

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:46.320
well he doesn't know Barrett

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:48.320
I didn't know her then either

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:50.320
so I pointed into Whitehead

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:52.320
but at one point in time when I say

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:54.320
do you want to get involved with my

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.320
PhD they don't have time

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.320
so much for trans-discipline

01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:00.320
yeah

01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:02.320
Yeah, that's a good

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.320
point I have been collaborating

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:06.320
with physicists in a

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:08.320
class of excellence at Hommel University

01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.320
and it was very interesting

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:12.320
where you also would experience this hierarchy

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.320
of STEM versus humanities

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.320
philosophy and so on

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.320
and that comes back to what Flo

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.320
was actually saying and that's where I hope

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.320
for the future generation

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.320
and that's interesting I talked

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:26.320
to Lisa Randall

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.320
and she was very much open

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.320
and she waited for

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.320
news and wanted to engage

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:34.320
by Carlo Rovalli again

01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.320
I somehow

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.320
have encountered many of

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:40.320
these physicists who are not

01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.320
seeing that there is a ton of philosophy

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:44.320
engaging with this and what

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:46.320
I also tried to say

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.320
initially in my talk

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.320
nothing that quantum mechanics

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:52.320
has to give epistemologically

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.320
is new

01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.320
to history nor anthropology

01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:58.320
it is not

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:00.320
it's rather that actually

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.320
Schrödinger's cat

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:04.320
tried to prevent

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.320
to bring these two worlds together

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:08.320
for certain reasons of dominance

01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:10.320
of physics and then you have the new

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.320
age movement and so on which is making

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.320
this thing fall apart and then again

01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:16.320
people would say oh no we don't go into esoterics

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.320
but if you go today in science and

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:20.320
technology studies or if you go to

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:22.320
Hawaiian philosophers

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.320
and Hawaiian cosmologists as I just

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.320
have been last month at

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.320
a big 4S conference

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:30.320
you will find

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:32.320
the exact same idea

01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:34.320
that you as a philosophy

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.320
of healing that is

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.320
combining the people of Hawaii

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:40.320
of people of aboriginal societies

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:42.320
in Australia, in New Zealand

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.320
or people who do quantum mechanics

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:46.320
and take this series

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.320
and transfer it into the world

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:50.320
and it's sad that Ovelli insists

01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:52.320
on his position of power

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.320
but that relates again to the imperial

01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:56.320
power position of physics

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.320
as such that is falling

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.320
as much

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.320
as you can see also with

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:04.320
the falling

01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:06.320
part of believing in science as such

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:08.320
with the rise of all these

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.320
kind of destabilizations of fact

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.320
making through

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.320
all these people who believe in whatever

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:16.320
kind of piracies.

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:18.320
I suggest you

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.320
send me the email address of

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:22.320
the Lauren who is interested

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.320
and then another thing

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:26.320
is I do think

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.320
quantum physics

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.320
shakes ontology

01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:34.320
What kind of ontology?

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:36.320
The ontology as we see it

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.320
as the philosophy of being

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.320
it makes it

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.320
dynamic instead of static

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:44.320
oh yes it does

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.320
and so

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:48.320
I think the ontological

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:50.320
implications

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.320
of quantum physics are more

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.320
important and if

01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:56.320
you have an ontological

01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.320
problem

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.320
you cannot even have an epistemology

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.320
you don't have anything anymore

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.320
so you have to go to another kind

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.320
of thinking about

01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:08.320
life

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.320
which is no longer in being

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:12.320
but also in becoming

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.320
Yes

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:16.320
for example if you lead

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:18.320
Elizabeth Povinelli, geontologies of the

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:20.320
otherwise as anthropologists

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.320
would deal with this also Mackenzie

01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:24.320
Warke

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:26.320

01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:28.320
It's a beautiful book

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.320
I suggest that I

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:32.320
ask Marta for your email address

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:34.320
and then you

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.320
send me your references because this is

01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:38.320
not going to work here. Wonderful

01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.320
Okay no I totally agree with you

01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.320
it does and that's the beauty of it

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:44.320
I agree with you

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.320
Okay Francis

01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:48.320
Let me

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.320
take the position which I

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.320
not used to take of

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:54.320
defending the STEM sciences here

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:56.320
I'm personally

01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:58.320
with one foot in STEM one foot

01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.320
in the humanities I'm

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:02.320
officially a philosopher

01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:04.320
connected to the Department of Philosophy

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:06.320
my PhD is in physics

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.320
but it was actually more about the philosophy

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:10.320
of quantum mechanics

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.320
so I know the domain quite well

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.320
and I want to say that

01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:16.320
it's not sufficient to say there is some similarity

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:18.320
between Hawaiian philosophy

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.320
or Daoist philosophy

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:22.320
and quantum mechanics to say that

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.320
well they are equal there at the same level

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.320
Quantum mechanics

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:28.320
is a highly technical

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:30.320
domain with a lot of deep

01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:32.320
philosophical problems but the technical

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.320
domain means that there is quite a lot

01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:36.320
of very hard mathematics in there

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.320
you can't do without it

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.320
it's thanks to these mathematics that we can

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:42.320
build all these

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:44.320
transistors and lasers

01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:46.320
and all these incredible

01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:48.320
technological applications of quantum mechanics

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.320
this is

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.320
something there are no shortcuts for that

01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:54.320
it's not sufficient to say

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.320
I have heard

01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.320
Hawaiian philosophy they say the same as quantum mechanics

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:00.320
maybe at some level

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.320
they say the same but if you want

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:04.320
to study quantum mechanics you have to go to

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:06.320
all the work

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:08.320
and it is a lot of work

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:10.320
I have done part of it I have given it up

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:12.320
at a certain moment and moved my career in a different

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:14.320
direction

01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.320
Derek Arts who was the former director

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:18.320
of Claire is still working in quantum mechanics

01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:20.320
he's still coming

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.320
with new ideas and he still

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:24.320
has to admit that there are lots of things

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:26.320
he doesn't understand so

01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:28.320
it's not a question of saying yes but these people

01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:30.320
they just work from

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.320
a position of authority

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.320
so they don't listen to people

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:36.320
who have new age ideas or who have

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.320
whatever ideas

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:40.320
no these people know that

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:42.320
to go into the depth you really

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:44.320
need to go

01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:46.320
to all the hard

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:48.320
work all the mathematics

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:50.320
and at that level

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:52.320
you can't have a conversation just with a philosopher

01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:54.320
if the philosopher goes

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:56.320
to all the hard work and goes to all the mathematics

01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.320
then maybe you can go

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.320
more deeply into the

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:02.320
what quantum mechanics really means

01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:04.320
because as Feynman said

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.320
if you believe you understand quantum mechanics

01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.320
you haven't understood it

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:10.320
Yes Francis you are opening

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.320
many doors and I really think that

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:14.320
you're just listening half of what I'm

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.320
saying sometimes because

01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:18.320
that's exactly what I'm thinking

01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:20.320
I totally agree

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:22.320
and I cannot agree more after spending

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:24.320
eight years with physicists

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.320
studying at the university

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.320
sitting there

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:30.320
taking classes in the history of physics

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.320
taking classes in physics

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.320
of different levels

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.320
and also spending time with quantum mechanics

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.320
people with computer simulations

01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.320
people and high energy physics people

01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.320
and that's why I'm sometimes also very

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.320
careful when I see people

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.320
who are perceiving themselves as Hawaiian

01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.320
cosmologists as indigenous cosmologists

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.320
saying

01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:52.320
what people in quantum mechanics

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:54.320
say

01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:56.320
that's actually what we are also saying

01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.320
I wrote an article on ontological opportunism

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.320
where I

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:02.320
describe exactly that kind of communication

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.320
between a Lakuta Su

01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:06.320
cosmologist on the one hand

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:08.320
and a physicist at CERN

01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:10.320
where the Lakuta Su

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.320
would actually see in the exchange particle

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.320
Iktomi

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:16.320
the trickster god

01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:18.320
and would study

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:20.320
from his perspective

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:22.320
quantum mechanics

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:24.320
physicists try to translate and get into

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.320
resonance with this

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:28.320
and

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:30.320
there is no doubt

01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:32.320
that one thing is mathematics

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:34.320
and as you said also Feynman was saying

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:36.320
when you think you have understood it

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:38.320
you're not understanding quantum mechanics

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.320
that's one thing

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:42.320
and the second thing is that something I asked

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:44.320
always theoretical physicists

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:46.320
when I interviewed them was

01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:48.320
has mathematics been

01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:50.320
invented or found

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:52.320
and the most witty answer

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:54.320
to this question was by Lisa Randall

01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:56.320
because she wasn't sure about it

01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.320
whether it's invented or found

01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.320
and she said if we have

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.320
invented it then we found

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:04.320
a very good thing

01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:06.320
with mathematics

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.320
so I totally agree with you

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.320
and I think one has to be aware of this

01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:12.320
but now we are

01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.320
coming to strategic

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:16.320
alliances again

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.320
and the strategic alliance

01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:20.320
between the way

01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:22.320
quantum mechanics allows to understand

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:24.320
the world even if you do not get it

01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:26.320
on the basis of mathematics on the one hand

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:28.320
and those indigenous cosmologies

01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:30.320
are very useful and necessary

01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:32.320
to save Gaia

01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:34.320
so it's just a strategic alliance

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:36.320
discussing

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:38.320
who has here what kind of

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:40.320
you know deeper foundation

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:42.320
for me not my point

01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:44.320
I just want to have a strategic alliance to save this planet

01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:46.320
and to come to a better living together

01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:48.320
that's all what I want

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:50.320
so thank you Francis for pointing this out

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:52.320
because that's at most important

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:56.320
Zlatka

01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.320
Thank you

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:04.320
for your

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:06.320
interesting presentation

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:08.320
I first would like to

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.320
second one what

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:12.320
