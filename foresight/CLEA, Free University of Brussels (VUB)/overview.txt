 Thank you, Zlatka, for facilitating this conversation. I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts and agree with Fotis's points regarding the depth and complexity of quantum mechanics. It's important to acknowledge that the technical aspects of quantum mechanics require rigorous mathematical study and understanding, which is essential for the practical applications we benefit from today.

I also concur with Fotis that while there may be parallels or similarities between certain indigenous philosophies and quantum mechanics at a conceptual level, this does not replace the need for the hard work and technical knowledge required to fully comprehend and apply quantum mechanics.

The strategic alliance Fotis mentions is indeed crucial. The collaboration between those with deep mathematical understanding of quantum mechanics and those with insights from indigenous cosmologies can be highly beneficial in our collective effort to address environmental challenges and strive for a harmonious coexistence on this planet.

In essence, we should value both the technical expertise in quantum mechanics and the wisdom found in various cultural traditions, recognizing that each has its own contributions to make towards solving the complex issues we face today. It's through combining these perspectives that we can move forward effectively. Thank you for the stimulating discussion.

1. **Cognitive Boundary**: The discussion revolved around the concept of a cognitive boundary, which represents the limit of what an organism can comprehend or perceive at a given time. This idea was explored through the metaphor of a light cone in spacetime, but it was suggested that a more fitting metaphor might be a "cognitive horizon" akin to the concept of prospect, which encompasses both anticipation and notions of value or direction.

2. **Prospect Theory**: The notion of prospect as an important idea in evolution and consciousness development was discussed. Prospect refers to what one can see ahead—potential goals to strive towards or dangers to avoid. It is a concept that aligns with the cognitive boundary, as a larger prospect facilitates finding valuable goals and avoiding potential threats.

3. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The speaker highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of these concepts, drawing parallels between the formation of shapes in design and art processes, and the cognitive boundary in biological and philosophical contexts. The questions of how a system defines its shape and how it knows when it has formed the correct shape are crucial and relevant across various fields, including design, art, and cognitive science.

4. **Future Discussion**: After the talk, there was an agreement to continue the discussion via email, with the speaker expressing interest in further exploring these ideas and connections.

5. **Break and Continuation**: The participants were invited to take a break and have coffee before reconvening for the final talk of the event, where Maximiliano Sanin would discuss modeling transport networks. The recording was paused to allow for the generation of videos during the break.

The conversation underscored the importance of interdisciplinary dialogue and the potential for shared insights across different fields, with a particular focus on how these concepts relate to human cognition, perception, and the creative process.

 Throughout the discussion, several key points were made regarding reductionism, ontology, and the limitations of our understanding due to the complexity of reality and the tools we have for modeling it. Here's a summary of the main themes:

1. **Reductionism as a Simplification**: Reductionism is a way of understanding complex systems by breaking them down into simpler components. However, this simplification can be limiting because it often overlooks the interconnectedness and emergent properties of complex systems.

2. **Quantum Computing and Limitations**: The advent of quantum computing may challenge our current reductionist models, as these computers could potentially handle and process complex systems in ways that are currently beyond our comprehension.

3. **Models as Simplifications**: Models are inherently simplified representations of reality. It's crucial to be aware that they are not the reality itself but tools for prediction and understanding within certain contexts.

4. **Ontology and Processes**: The discussion touched on the nature of ontology—the branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being—and how our conceptual frameworks, including those on blackboards, are limited by our ability to imagine and represent the depth of reality.

5. **Evolving Understanding**: As our understanding evolves, so too must our models and reductionist approaches. This is evident throughout history, where each generation revisits and redefines what it means to be reductionist.

6. **Open-Ended Models**: The ontological approach discussed allows for an open underneath model that can adapt and change as new information emerges. This model does not fixate on specific particles or properties but rather focuses on the patterns, stability, and self-maintenance of conditions.

7. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: The emphasis on flexibility and adaptability in models is crucial for capturing the complexity of reality without becoming too rigid or confined by preconceived notions.

In essence, the conversation highlighted the importance of recognizing the limitations of our current understanding and models, while also embracing the need for flexibility and adaptability to accommodate new discoveries and perspectives.
