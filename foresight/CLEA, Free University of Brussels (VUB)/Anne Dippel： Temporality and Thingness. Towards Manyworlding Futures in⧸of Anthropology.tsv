0	2560	So Anne, the floor is yours.
3560	5100	We already see your slides.
5100	10100	So put the spotlight on the floor, welcome.
13140	14480	Yeah, thank you very much.
15560	19240	Before I start my talk and dive into,
19240	21320	I just would like to know
21320	25080	what your personal academic background is.
25080	27640	So you do not have to talk too much,
27680	31200	just everybody who's from the STEM field
31200	34760	should please raise her or his or their arms
34760	37760	so that I know whether anybody, okay.
37760	41040	So we have one STEM person, two STEM persons,
41040	45040	three STEM persons, four STEM persons, thank you very much.
45040	47000	And is there anybody of the humanities
47000	51760	and social science background of philosophy also?
51760	53880	Okay, wonderful, okay.
53880	56200	So since there are more people who are
56200	59360	in the STEM background than not,
59360	62440	I will just briefly give in two sentences,
62440	65480	I try to let you know what we are actually doing
65480	70040	as anthropologists because as I once met a very old physicist
70040	73320	who still has been raised in the tradition of
73320	75560	Werner Heisenbach and others,
75560	77840	many people think anthropology is something
77840	79880	that everybody can do,
79880	83360	but actually anthropology is involving also
83360	85200	a huge set of methodology
85200	90200	and is a year-long training of doing fieldwork amongst people.
90560	93960	And some people do fieldwork in foreign cultures
93960	97560	to themselves, other do fieldwork within their home cultures.
97560	101320	And the third people do a fieldwork in knowledge cultures.
101320	104560	And I'm an anthropologist of physics and computer science.
104560	107480	That means that I'm actually living with
107480	109400	and have been living with physicists
109400	113000	and computer scientists for the past eight years.
113000	115040	And I'm really diving into their world.
115040	116960	I'm learning their language.
116960	119360	I'm experiencing what they experience
119360	122240	and experience is also the most central term
122240	124760	of what we're doing as anthropologists.
124760	127560	That means that we already know very much
127560	132480	that what we see is biased by our own observations
132480	134760	and that of course everything we observed
134760	137080	within the real world can be just described
137080	140240	as approximation by ourselves.
140240	141400	So when we do fieldwork,
141400	144080	we have developed over the past 150 years,
144080	147080	a toolset that allows us to differentiate
147080	149800	what is our own perceptual bias.
149800	151880	And on the other hand, what we can see in the field
151880	154440	and where we actually invent the field.
154440	155600	And that's very much important
155600	158800	because there's very often, especially from the STEM field,
158800	161480	the question when we're not working with numbers
161480	164040	and we stop working with statistics predominantly,
164040	166600	we have been and do work with statistics.
166600	168440	We call that mixed methods,
168440	171240	but we predominantly work with interviews,
171240	173640	with language, with listening to the people.
174000	176880	With actually experiencing their lives.
176880	179800	And anthropologists, therefore, is a training
179800	182640	and since we are time-bound human deadly beings,
182640	185840	it takes time to become an anthropologist.
185840	188200	So that's what we actually do.
188200	190560	And that allows us to live with the people
190560	193360	and to understand what's their concern.
193360	195480	And what I'm going to do today with you
195480	198040	is to tell you out of my research
198040	199480	that I did in the last years
200760	202880	and dive into the question of future.
202880	204600	And I think that's very much of importance,
204600	205840	especially when you work with
205840	207640	within the field of quantum mechanics,
207640	210320	artificial intelligence and so on and so on,
210320	213360	because these fields are really shaping the digital era
213360	215280	and transforming the whole world
215280	217200	and the whole communities we're living in.
217200	219640	And that's something that's rather my turf.
219640	221880	So I'm looking very much forward also
222880	227560	to the discussions that we have and we will have.
227560	229840	In the last years, I have been, for example,
229840	233040	publishing last year, came out a book first in German,
233040	234320	The Translations in Process,
234320	237520	where I did an ethnography of the computer simulation
237520	240040	of the quantum mechanical double slit experiment
240040	242720	in a single event-based computer simulation
242720	245000	at the research center in Jülich
245000	248040	and compared it with the quantum mechanical double slit
248040	251560	experiments conducted in Vienna today.
251560	254560	And came out with a comparison, actually,
254560	257040	but about the Schrödinger equation on the one hand
257040	259160	and on the other hand, computer simulation.
259160	262240	So different forms of approximating reality
262240	265360	on the one hand based on first principles in mathematics,
265360	269120	on the other hand based on the approximation to truth
269120	271920	by a single event computer simulation.
271920	275920	And these produce different forms of reality
275920	277240	or interpretations of reality,
277240	279760	which doesn't mean that there isn't any truth anymore,
279760	281160	but the problem of course is,
281160	284280	and you're more aware than I am that with simulation,
284280	287600	you can actually show everything that you want to
287600	292360	and then everything that could be considered as reality
292360	296880	can be put into equality with what is actually
296880	298920	the real reality itself.
298920	301480	And that was quite a challenge and also a lot of fun
301480	305960	because quantum mechanics is something that is posing
305960	307960	all these questions and shattering
307960	311100	the understanding of nature more than anything else.
312160	315000	Something that wasn't so bizarre to us as anthropologists
315000	320000	because for us, the world is itself always either or,
320280	322360	and not neither or, but neither nor
322360	324680	and has these kinds of entanglements.
324680	327600	So what we found out in the last years
327600	330480	resonates very well with what quantum mechanics
330480	332840	and other disciplines found out.
332840	334800	And in the last years also I dealt a lot
334800	337120	with anthropology of play and games,
337120	339760	with the interrelations of facts and fictions
339760	341840	and how cosmologies are made
341840	345180	and what role science has these days
345180	350180	where fictions are shattering the world of fact-making.
353800	358720	In the next 45 minutes, so I will first of all
358720	360720	bring you onto a journey
360720	364000	and in the field of humanities and social sciences
364000	365520	where I'm classically trained,
365520	368460	we very often read written texts.
368460	372500	We are text-based and written hermeneutical disciplines.
372500	375900	We love writing and so please lay back
375900	380900	and bear that it was important to me to write down for you
381500	384900	and what I have been saying because it mattered so much
384900	386580	to me what I wanted to tell you
386580	389820	that I tried to put it into my rusty German English
389820	393860	because more I'm not able to do than rusty German English.
393860	396580	And in this journey, I will first tell you
396620	398540	how I actually ended up at CERN,
398540	400620	how I came to this field work that I did
400620	402300	and that I'm going to present you.
402300	404940	And then I will dive into the question of uncertainty
404940	409940	that stem scientists encounter on all levels.
410220	413260	And what we actually as anthropologists can see
413260	417860	and observe how rhythms of mechanical technology
417860	421580	and algorithmic and also human uncertainty
421580	423740	are going into an interplay
423740	425860	which transform each individual
425860	427960	that is doing actually science
427960	430460	within an experimental field
431580	433340	turns it from an individual
433340	435580	into something that I call intravisual
435580	437380	and how I'm coming to that point
437380	439860	and to describe how this collaboration
439860	442500	of different people doing field work
442500	446340	turning from individuals in entanglement with others
446340	448740	to intravisuals to actually produce science
448740	450060	and to make things happen.
450060	452260	That's something I wanna take you onto a journey with
452260	453380	in the next minutes.
455100	458060	So far, any questions from your side?
460820	461940	Wonderful.
461940	466940	So, field work is a form of memoir making.
467460	469620	Reminds us anthropologist Ruth Behr.
470820	474100	From that perspective, it is a cultural fact-making
474100	476480	of a future yet to come.
477380	479580	Maybe that explains why anthropologists
479580	482940	did not focus on future as a cultural fact
482940	486300	until Arjun Apadurai reminded the discipline.
486300	490020	We were blinded by our own deformation professionel
490020	493300	by the obvious movement of our own way of knowledge production
493300	495980	with field notes and recorded interviews
495980	498260	and tempted by collective interests
498260	500580	and individuals need to know where we
500580	502540	or they are coming from.
502540	504180	Because as already in Odysseys,
504180	506020	people want to know where they're living
506020	507540	and where they're coming from.
507580	509580	But since the future is uncertain,
509580	512860	that's something we do not actually investigate so much with
512860	515100	because we are not fortune tellers.
515100	517180	But it becomes more and more important
517180	518700	in a time of computer simulation
518700	520940	where you actually have to foresee and you can
520940	524220	and you have tools to foresee and estimate futures
524220	526340	quite precisely.
526340	528540	And that is where anthropology becomes interesting
528540	530980	when you think about the future
530980	532500	and how the future is made.
533580	536780	A long time ago, anthropology was a space bound
536780	539740	and historiography a time bound discipline.
539740	542940	Anthropology deals with futures and realities
542940	545020	and what is happening in the now.
545020	548340	And historiography is looking into the past.
548340	551580	The first anthropology mistrusted by design
551580	554180	how the past is made through archival sources
554180	556620	because who chooses what is going into the archives?
556620	558740	Who chooses the truth of the past?
558740	561380	Why the latter, historiography,
561380	564660	mistrusted any investigations of the contemporary
564700	568620	as already the philosopher Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel summed it up,
568620	571580	the flight of my nervous old is blind in the now.
571580	573020	We cannot understand the now
573020	575860	because we are part of the present.
575860	578660	And it was this Hegel's challenge encountered
578660	580700	by the ethnographers attempt to understand
580700	583580	what is going on right now that turned me
583580	587220	into an anthropologist from historiography coming.
587220	589700	And it is this challenge that drives me from now on
589700	591860	to the days that are coming.
591860	593660	I always was drawn to understand
593660	595780	what humans make out of this being in
595780	598300	and beyond space, time and matter.
598300	600060	And that is what I will talk about.
601300	603100	In the following minutes, I want to contribute
603100	606580	to the question how different futures are being practiced,
606580	611140	narrated, placed and made tangible in everyday life worlds.
611140	614420	I'm doing so by reflecting upon ethnographic insights.
614420	616540	I gathered over the past eight years
616540	619380	in the falling empire that discursively
619380	621580	and technically reigned what Karen Barat,
621580	624340	a philosopher and physicist called, I quote,
624340	627660	imperialism of universal space and time.
627660	629180	I'm talking about physics
629180	632580	and to be more precise, high energy physics.
632580	635260	Why I consider this a falling empire
635260	638380	and not a reigning empire we can talk about later.
638380	640660	I'm very curious about it.
640660	643820	And I'm also taking up the challenge to discuss this.
645180	648540	I'm telling tales how physicists deal with resistances
648540	651980	of materiality and masculinity.
651980	654220	I'm not aiming to explain to you again
654220	656740	the cosmology and technologies of physics
656740	660060	with the help of feminist science and technology studies
660060	662940	or to retell you how physicists do their job.
662940	664260	I did this elsewhere.
664260	666100	And I think there are enough people in this room
666100	669300	who know much better and more about this than I do.
669300	671380	And others actually did this already,
671380	674140	like Sharon Trawig, Karen Knott-Cetina
674140	677580	or the Belgian philosopher Isabel Stengers.
677580	679420	Rather, I try to give an account
679420	681740	out of one of the centers of the ruined
681740	683780	and ruinous places of Europe,
683780	687020	this de-centered and misplaced territory of Gaia
687020	689900	as Pernullatou and others would call it.
689900	694220	It is an account of how people deal with uncertainty
694220	698100	out of concern and care for what they love most,
698100	702140	which is in this case, an experimental system of physics.
703180	706180	I'm looking for what is a wondrous future to them,
706180	709140	which is to understand what constitutes our cosmos,
709140	711700	I quote, from a physical point of view
711700	714580	and collaborate in a common universal enterprise
714580	719260	that includes everything and excludes exclusivity in the end.
720460	723260	My ethnography is the account of a most cis,
723260	726340	hetero and male white dominant field.
726340	728740	Its origins of organization and community
728740	731620	are dating back to war, to the Second World War,
731620	735060	the atom bomb plus alamos, physics people did learn
735060	738740	to love the bomb when it just existed as a vague plan.
738740	740460	In fact, they made it up.
741540	744460	These people are Stanley Kubrick's blueprints
744460	746420	and they are not.
746420	749020	For where is normativity and power,
749020	751940	there is resistance and subversion also
751940	754220	and foremost amongst physicists.
755300	758780	And even physicists' identities aren't either all
758780	762300	or especially physicists' identities aren't dualist,
762300	764860	but carefully monitored and risk-managed.
764860	769820	Yes, these guys, as even women in the field often call themselves,
769820	772340	are separating nature and culture.
772340	775860	Yes, they seem to be hopeless platonics,
775860	778780	believing and proving mathematics idealism
778780	782500	and helpless Aristotelians observing and measuring nature,
782500	784620	making up categories and models.
785500	789820	They mistrust their data and falsify hypothesis.
789820	792740	They pushed ethics into another department,
792740	796140	but didn't we as anthropologists in Germany too,
796140	798460	when we decided not to be a political discipline
798460	800220	after the Second World War,
800220	803620	and what we are actually doing is transforming again
803620	805460	into a political discipline.
805460	806900	And that's very fascinating,
806900	809140	but from a decolonial perspective,
809140	812340	in times of identity crisis of Europe all over Europe.
813380	816580	You see, I will be talking from a West German
816580	819460	wide middle upper class perspective,
819460	822420	not of my choice, but of discursive attribution.
823340	826460	I like to see from any other point of view,
826460	828420	but I come from these privileged worlds
828420	830380	and thus unlearn every day to look
830380	832700	and loosen up conceptions I grew up with.
833780	836740	Thus, addicts met us to me on many levels
836740	840300	and rethinking the world from this ruined and ruinous place
840300	843460	employed by the university of Jena
843460	846100	that granted Karl Marx his PhD
846100	849440	and allowed Hegel to write his phenomenology of perception,
849440	852800	just pushes me to understand local specificities
852800	854760	and global peculiarities
854760	857680	in ever more solidarity-needing world
857680	859960	that craves for togetherness
859960	862520	and a sense of Guyon community,
862520	866520	but fragments in small communities of indigenities
866520	869160	that lose the big picture on the one hand,
869160	871200	and in the meantime on the other,
871200	873400	Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos battle
873400	875200	for the shuttle service to the moon.
875200	879840	Whatever we learned, no matter what we see,
879840	883240	intraactions, and I'm deploying here the term of Karen Barat
883240	884560	that she developed
884560	887760	out of the Copenhagen interpretation of Nils Bohr,
887760	889640	intraactions of realities,
889640	893800	that means phenomena are emerging out of the interaction
893800	897520	within the moment and aren't pre-disposed.
897520	898920	Interactions of realities
898920	902680	build the fundament of our disciplinary insights.
902680	905600	Experiences are not human-made alone.
905600	907640	And chance, as we all patients,
907640	910280	as well as patients, are our most important assets
910280	914320	for doing a good analysis of our own empirical insight.
915320	916160	That's right.
916160	917560	Yeah?
917560	919560	They're not based on the truth.
921400	922320	Excuse me.
925680	926800	Should I continue?
929000	930000	Just for the...
933680	935000	Are you still there?
938320	939160	Yes, yes.
939160	940480	Okay.
940480	941480	So...
942480	943800	All right.
943800	949280	So, I rather prefer not to talk about humans anymore,
949280	950960	and we as an anthropology,
950960	953640	and that's also very interesting, our stop and reflect
953640	957800	of how to call actually our new alliances within the world.
957800	960360	And that makes it even more interesting
960560	964640	because physics is dealing by definition with what is not living,
964640	968000	while biology and so on is dealing with what is alive.
968000	970280	And we are shattering these kind of conceptions
970280	971280	out of different reasons.
971280	973360	On the one hand, because there are many cosmologies
973360	975920	like Southern American cosmologies
975920	980640	or Antarctic cosmologies and people who live
980640	983200	in these regions who would never distinct
983200	985200	between living and un-living.
985200	987200	And on the other hand, because...
987920	989920	And on the other hand, because...
989920	994520	And made the others after the Gaia development
994520	996480	of James Lovelock and so on,
996480	998880	come to another perception of understanding the Earth
998880	1003160	and humans within the Earth when they took the perspective
1003160	1006080	out of the extraterrestrial perspective on Earth
1006080	1008520	that emerged with the Kodak picture of 1972
1008520	1010960	of the Apollo Kodak picture of Earth.
1010960	1015280	So, I like the word Terence, which is a new term,
1015280	1016680	a post-humanist term,
1016680	1019320	deployed by Deborah Danowski, Bruno Latour
1019320	1021440	and Eduardo Vivero Stikasto
1021440	1023840	for those aware and grounded beings
1023840	1026560	and things opposing modern just humans
1026560	1028200	and their objectifications.
1028200	1032000	And that allows me to understand anthropology in a new way.
1032000	1034760	I study Anthropos and its ethnoi,
1034760	1037760	so their people and communities on all scales,
1037760	1040160	but I stopped to think this kind of kinship
1040160	1042680	that we traditionally had just amongst humans.
1042680	1044800	There are new modes of kin, kin with Earth,
1044800	1047360	kin with trees, other forms of relations,
1047360	1049160	and that makes it all interesting.
1049160	1051000	And from an alien point of view,
1051000	1053840	we are all Earthlings or Terence.
1053840	1055520	And it seems to me that this message
1055520	1058960	is the most important one one can share out of my field
1058960	1062120	of studying the so-called reasonable physicists
1062120	1064800	because physicists actually have quite a similar perception
1064800	1066520	on these things.
1066520	1068560	And they are, on the other hand,
1068560	1070600	gatekeepers of modern humanism,
1070600	1073000	inventors of the worldwide web protocol
1073000	1076120	and main forces in the development of computer simulations.
1078960	1082080	To dare to think from a futurist's perspective,
1082080	1085840	to turn science fiction into contemporary every day
1085840	1088520	was for me one of the most fascinating aspects
1088520	1090760	I observed at CERN.
1090760	1093840	CERN is a collaborative digital enterprise.
1093840	1096760	Each individual is connected to various media
1096760	1099000	and is transforming into something else,
1099000	1101320	not only into a digital divideral,
1101320	1103880	that's a concept that emerged by Marilyn's CERN
1103880	1106240	to understand Papua New Guinea societies,
1106240	1107720	which do not have people there,
1107720	1109360	do not have an individualist concept
1109360	1111960	as we do have here in Europe.
1111960	1113800	But actually it seems to me into something
1113800	1117360	what I want to call with the help of quantum mechanical
1117360	1120040	natural philosophy, intra-vigral.
1120040	1124080	So I'm connecting the intra and the inner of the individual
1124080	1126320	on the one hand with the collectivity.
1126320	1129920	And it turns that in these kind of scientific collaborations
1129920	1132920	that are based on digital tools,
1132920	1136920	the solitary of the single researcher
1136920	1138960	becomes a solitary being
1138960	1142480	with all its productive and destructive forces and dynamics.
1145080	1147240	And what is really fascinating is that physicists
1147240	1150080	are all the time not only trying to deal
1150080	1153760	and resonate with science fiction as a fixtures metaphor,
1153760	1155480	but really try to think the future
1155480	1156520	and have to think the future
1156520	1158800	because their experiments are happening in the future.
1158800	1160840	I will come to this in the following.
1162840	1164200	In order to make this point,
1164200	1165720	I get down to Earth with you
1165720	1167560	into the everyday of fictions of science
1167560	1170800	or how bugs, Martin and screw and others
1170800	1172240	are intervening everyday physics
1172240	1175320	and how the biggest resistance is coming from materiality
1175320	1177040	and also interestingly enough,
1177040	1179280	a certain type of masculinity
1179280	1182240	and discursive practice and rights.
1182240	1185520	Physics can still teach us something about the future,
1185520	1188760	especially how to deal with that, what we do not know,
1188760	1192320	and yet how to deal with expectations and power relations.
1195360	1197640	But first, I want to tell you how I ended up at CERN
1197640	1199320	and what brought me into the situation
1199320	1201520	where I'm in right now.
1201520	1204560	In my first field, I was doing research in Vienna.
1204560	1207760	I was discussing with local artists and writers in Austria
1207760	1210240	about the relation of words and worlds
1210240	1211160	and what to make of it
1211160	1214120	when it comes to cultural identity politics.
1214120	1216640	From a German speaking case, that's very fascinating
1216640	1219400	because some of you might know that Hitler was Austrian,
1219400	1226400	but he became the leader of the German Empire.
1226400	1228400	And after the Second World War,
1228400	1231480	the Austrians had to become actually an own nation state
1231480	1234720	and they are a good example of successful nation building.
1234720	1237200	So the successful creation of a collective identity
1237200	1239960	and writers played in a very important role
1239960	1242600	when it came up to deal with the atrocities committed
1242600	1244120	in the name of the German people
1244160	1246800	that Austrians tried to push away from themselves
1246800	1248360	but had to made aware, of course,
1248360	1252680	because anti-Semitism and everything that went along
1252680	1254000	with the atrocities committed
1254000	1256600	and the crimes committed in the name of the German people
1256600	1260080	were also committed in and by Austrians and from Austrians, too.
1260080	1262280	And that fascinated me a lot.
1262280	1265080	And I came into this field and did this research
1265080	1266880	and one wonders how do I end up at CERN
1266880	1269040	and there are many, many different reasons why.
1269040	1271800	But one of them was actually an epistemic problem.
1271800	1273600	And the epistemic problem was the question
1273600	1277240	how to deal and understand what I said in the beginning,
1277240	1280560	how to understand in real time in the now something
1280560	1284280	that is happening while I'm part of what is part of the system.
1287360	1290160	And it was the hottest summer in Vienna,
1290160	1293920	a steel melting heat near the New River.
1293920	1296720	And one afternoon, the sky was filled with baroque clouds
1296720	1298760	and rain was about to come.
1298760	1300320	And the wind blew through the streets.
1300320	1303440	I watched it from my window and it all sounds very poetic.
1303680	1305920	But also I started to think.
1305920	1308440	A tree just beneath the house waved its crown
1308440	1310400	and I started to watch the leaves.
1310400	1312040	And from the whole of the leaves,
1312040	1314640	I tried to follow the movement of each one of the leaves,
1314640	1317880	tried to perceive all different movements of each leaf
1317880	1321160	of this one tree waving in the wind back and forth
1321160	1323440	at the same time.
1323440	1326120	I don't know whether the thought that we as humans
1326120	1328720	are like these leaves on the Gaia tree
1328720	1330920	or whether the thousand movements of the tree
1330920	1332560	in the wind came first.
1332600	1335480	But I understood in that moment why any observer,
1335480	1338120	even the most unentangled sitting on a window
1338120	1341120	and staring into the streets or onto this tree,
1341120	1343920	is not able to capture historical time
1343920	1345280	and its complexity.
1346640	1348400	For this tree is moved by the wind,
1348400	1351960	but the thermodynamics are transforming each micro area
1351960	1354680	into another zone and each leaf is a leaf on its own
1354680	1358760	and left alone while at the same time connected to the tree.
1358760	1360480	You see where I'm going
1360480	1362480	and maybe understand this allegory.
1362480	1365720	Why I thought that I had to head into the world of physics
1365720	1369040	to give the spatial concept of ethnographic fields
1369040	1372640	and observer another temporal dimension.
1372640	1375600	Since then, I wonder why Bronislav Malinovsky,
1375600	1378120	one of the founding figures of anthropology
1378120	1380640	who studied physics first in Kraków,
1380640	1382400	did not follow quantum mechanics
1382400	1385520	and did not include into his concepts of ethnography
1385520	1388920	at that time the experimental insights
1388920	1391280	that actually shattered the world of the 1920s
1391280	1392800	and 1930s in physics.
1394560	1395800	It was the tree in front
1395800	1397680	of my first Viennese field department,
1397680	1400080	Albert Gassevillon 20, Sieb der Bezirk,
1400080	1402400	that led me to a fatal book choice
1402400	1406280	in my favorite book shop of that time, Buchhandlung Posch.
1406280	1407920	I was sitting on a wooden chair
1407920	1410720	where many famous Austrian writers said before
1410720	1412760	as the owner of the shop reminded me
1412760	1416720	as part of his peculiar Viennese sales psychology,
1416720	1421120	which always mixes a sense of clients' unwelcoming,
1421120	1424280	owners' entitlement and traditionality
1424280	1426720	disguised in ancienité
1426720	1429960	to give things a value beyond its market price.
1431040	1434640	I saw Lisa Randall's book, Theoretical Physicist,
1434640	1437480	Warp Passages, unraveling the mysteries
1437480	1441080	of the university's hidden dimensions.
1441080	1442800	And back then I didn't know that I one day
1442800	1446000	would become friends with Lisa Randall and climb with her,
1446000	1447480	but I was really surprised
1447480	1450240	because the way nature was made
1450240	1452200	in her pop scientific account
1452200	1456280	and how culture and cultural ideas were deployed
1456280	1461200	in a, to me, very uncareful way really just puzzled me.
1461200	1463280	And from that moment I knew I had to get
1463280	1466640	to know physicists better because they shape the world
1466640	1468880	and they have a very strong cosmology
1468880	1471520	and they use cultural ideas in a way
1471520	1475200	that really are surprising for me as a cultural scientist.
1475240	1478160	And it was clear to me where I had to go after
1478160	1480560	and to learn more about the culture
1480560	1482920	after I was studying poets.
1482920	1484560	It was the wind and the tree
1484560	1486760	that led me into the world of physics.
1486760	1488600	And then I went to CERN.
1492280	1494200	At CERN though, I encountered different ways
1494200	1495840	of dealing with space and time.
1495840	1498160	And actually what time as such could be
1498160	1501360	and was did not bother anybody near Lake Geneva.
1501360	1505800	As Isabelle Stengers put it, I quote her,
1505800	1509920	clearly a certain type of prophetic physics exists today,
1509920	1512440	but if we must speak of physics,
1512440	1514800	wouldn't it be preferable to approach it
1514800	1517360	from the viewpoint of the new undertaking
1517360	1519960	known as big science?
1519960	1521640	International financing,
1521640	1524280	the construction of large scale instruments,
1524280	1525800	management of an experiment
1525800	1528160	over a period of several years,
1528160	1530960	the organization of large numbers of colleagues,
1530960	1532440	the division of labor,
1532440	1534800	these are the kind of practical questions
1534800	1538800	that preoccupied cutting edge physicists today
1538800	1543040	far more than the ideal questions of physicists vocation.
1543040	1546440	And so today, I want to share with you
1546440	1548960	what we can learn from contemporary physics
1548960	1550520	when it comes to deal with the futures
1550520	1552800	in our anthropology as well.
1552800	1554960	And this encompasses foremost a way
1554960	1557560	of dealing with uncertainties of all kinds,
1557560	1560040	focusing on hardware, software
1560040	1564840	and dealing with a certain type of practiced masculinity.
1564840	1567840	It means of transformation of individualist perspective
1567840	1571680	into an intra-visualist vision.
1571680	1574280	I owe these insights to my field
1574280	1576640	and especially to the women in physics.
1576640	1578280	Some of them became friends of mine,
1578280	1581640	male and female, and I'm very glad about that.
1581640	1583480	Before I entered, people were warning me
1583480	1587000	that I quote should not ask the gender question,
1587000	1590000	end of quotation, that it is the quote death question
1590000	1591520	end of quotation.
1591520	1593760	And I never had to ask it.
1593760	1597920	It was always answered without asking me for it.
1597920	1600200	Since it's such an important and dominant topic,
1600200	1602480	people just started to talk about themselves
1602480	1605560	without that I even put it up.
1607840	1611680	But before I'm diving into the gender question,
1611680	1616680	I want to show you some of those levels of uncertainty
1617440	1619080	that exists at CERN
1619080	1621360	and why actually thinking the future
1621360	1624840	and rules are so important at this research site.
1624840	1628240	The pictures that you see are either taken by myself
1628240	1632160	or you find them on the website of the CERN collaboration.
1634520	1637200	Multiple agents weave the fabric of uncertainty
1637200	1639040	in a data-driven workspace,
1639040	1642000	at the same time orchestrating the ubiquitous phantasma
1642000	1644320	of certainty in an ever more unstable
1644320	1647320	economical, political, global reality.
1647320	1649600	In this talk, I will look at the current condition
1649600	1651880	going beyond the entanglement of hardware,
1651880	1654120	software, algorithm and infrastructure
1654120	1655840	as it has been done already.
1655840	1658640	What interests me is how humans interact with one another
1658640	1660120	when interacting with machines
1660120	1662040	in liberal structures of patriarchy,
1662040	1665760	so fundamental in the shaping of the data-driven world.
1665760	1669160	I put a particular emphasis on the rhythms of doing things
1669160	1672640	by investigating the importance of cuts and ruptures,
1672640	1677480	disturbing and destabilizing seemingly stable infrastructures.
1677480	1681040	Because when actually the infrastructure falls apart,
1681040	1683360	some hidden structures become visible
1683360	1685040	and that is something that fascinates me
1685040	1688520	when I talked about the subversion, for example, initially.
1688520	1690760	I will briefly mention uncertainties of hardware
1690760	1693000	and materialities as well as software
1693000	1694640	to come to the main point of this talk
1694640	1697120	dealing with reasonable humans and power.
1697120	1699000	One of the most political ones in times
1699000	1701320	of so-called gender wars
1701360	1703600	and heated discussions about identity politics
1703600	1705280	versus cultural dominations,
1705280	1709040	where the realms of universality and exclusivity
1709040	1711200	are renegotiated.
1711200	1714560	I will end my talk with the introduction of another neologism,
1714560	1716880	the individual that I already introduced to you
1716880	1718600	and reflect upon anthropologists
1718600	1723040	as trailblazing pathfinders of futures beyond the standard now,
1723040	1725600	because that is what actually makes us so special
1725600	1727520	amongst the humanities and social sciences.
1727520	1732320	We're really able to take a little piece of the future
1732320	1736680	and just talk about it and drag it into what's actually going on
1736680	1739560	because we are listening carefully to the people.
1739560	1742480	I'm interested today, especially in the questions of human relations
1742480	1745160	to one another within such apparatuses
1745160	1748080	regarding gender and race politics as dominant aspect
1748080	1750000	of what is about to come.
1750000	1754680	How does the servant manipulate the master to frame it he-like?
1754680	1758000	In turning from an individual to something I call intravigil,
1758000	1760440	a concerned being that foresees the future
1760440	1764640	and plots in companionship with an agent multiplicity.
1764640	1766280	This is where subaltern studies
1766280	1768760	in complex flat hierarchies lead,
1768760	1772280	for certain prides itself to have flat hierarchies,
1772280	1775880	but in fact, no hierarchy is flat when white males
1775880	1779720	and their tools are on the run to assert risk management.
1779720	1781520	And why does this matter again?
1781520	1783360	Why do I put up this whole question?
1783360	1787560	Because high energy physics relies on big data interpreted
1787560	1790680	and calculated using methods like those implemented
1790680	1793160	in assessing stock market value.
1793160	1796360	The constant flow of knowledge and human resources
1796360	1799560	from the scientific institution to the financial sector
1799560	1803560	is one of the arguments legitimizing the existence of CERN.
1803560	1807680	And the big bank companies of Geneva, of course,
1807680	1811280	are profiting from the flow of PhD grad students
1811280	1815760	that are flowing from CERN directly into the banking system
1815760	1817760	or to Google and so on and so on.
1819480	1821680	The human factor is the most crucial element
1821680	1824200	to understand uncertainty in a data-driven world.
1824200	1826160	The future of our economic system
1826160	1829160	is bound to research and sciences of many sorts.
1829160	1831840	It does not only matter with whom we are thinking thoughts,
1831840	1835360	but how we learn to responsibly use media and tools.
1835360	1837160	When it comes to what will happen,
1837200	1842000	uncertainty is the eternal constant of humanity's concern.
1842000	1846040	Uncertainty is encountered on all levels of experimental research,
1846040	1849960	from planning over construction and coding to measuring nature.
1849960	1851480	A few questions remain.
1851480	1854280	What and how do people learn to interact socially
1854280	1857000	when dealing with data and computing environments?
1857000	1859600	And what kind of uncertainties are they exposed to
1859600	1861560	in data-driven spaces?
1863760	1866880	The hardware is always uncertain.
1866880	1870120	Those who follow the developments of grand scientific experiments
1870120	1874800	might remember that the start of the Large Hadron Collider in 2008,
1874800	1876600	the world's biggest physics experiment
1876600	1879120	had been delayed by one year because of a loose screw.
1879120	1882680	And here you see the picture of the explosion
1882680	1885040	that was just happening
1885040	1888200	because one screw wasn't tightened well enough.
1888200	1892440	A tiny physical object caused a gargantuan obstacle to the machine,
1892440	1896360	whose maintenance costs exceed one billion euros per year,
1896360	1898760	and each citizen of the European Union, by the way,
1898760	1904320	pays five euros per year to CERN when you take your tax money.
1904320	1908400	Meanwhile, all the algorithms, when this happens, did still.
1908400	1911640	And a tiny, seemingly unimportant object shattered magnets
1911640	1916880	and within the dreams of the first data harvest of the Higgs boson.
1916880	1920240	For those of you who are not champs in Big Bang Theory at school,
1920240	1923200	the Higgs boson is a particle within the standard model
1923200	1925680	which gives mass to other particles
1925680	1930680	and helps to explain why our universe is not just made out of light and energy.
1930680	1933120	The Higgs, of course, is much smaller than the screw,
1933120	1937600	and unlike the screw, it is invisible to the human eye.
1937600	1943200	Paradoxically, the screw was neither seen nor foreseen
1943200	1945200	and that it would break,
1945200	1947120	delaying the experiment by one year,
1947120	1949600	while the Higgs, on the other hand, was foreseen,
1949600	1954520	simulated and calculated long before the digital experimental system.
1954520	1957480	Actually, the whole Large Hadron Collider is a big bet
1957480	1964560	that was made up in the 1960s when Peter Higgs came up with this theory.
1964560	1968280	With the help of pseudo-random Monte Carlo simulations
1968280	1973000	and incorporating and unthinking and ontologically consolidating random
1973000	1976840	to put it bluntly, physics is actually creating
1976840	1979280	futurist imaginaries through its theories
1979280	1986440	and physicists are serving as modern future tellers, fortune tellers.
1986440	1992000	Like historians, physicists interpret temporal traces,
1992000	1994880	but this is called a histogram, as most of you know.
1994880	2000720	So, histogram, it is a grammatics of the history of the Higgs particle
2000720	2004160	that you can see here and the events actually that were piling up
2004160	2006240	to show the existence of the Higgs particle.
2006240	2009280	That's something that physicists work with, not with the beautiful images
2009280	2012680	we know from the Higgs boson, maybe.
2012680	2015800	So, like historians, physicists interpret temporal traces,
2015800	2019000	but unlike historians, they simulate the events beforehand
2019000	2022040	and check afterwards what might have happened,
2022040	2024160	to say it with Leopold Ranke.
2024160	2028320	High energy physics is a security-driven world investigating nature,
2028320	2030960	which on the one hand is determined by laws
2030960	2035240	and on the other characterized by random behaviors, the uncertainty.
2035240	2038440	The drive to make data on measurements as certain as possible
2038440	2042160	exerts an influence on how information is perceived.
2042160	2045120	This road to scientific certainty, however,
2045120	2048520	is paved with present uncertainties of all kinds.
2048520	2051840	I have written about incidents like the one of the screw elsewhere
2051840	2054840	and if you're interested, I'm happy to send you a copy of this article,
2054840	2058080	which deals not only with the screw screwed, the start of the Higgs,
2058080	2061040	but also how a martin, a bird, bugs,
2061040	2064120	and finally the physical resistance of materiality itself
2064120	2066080	are constant factors to deal with
2066080	2069960	when planning and dealing with an experiment that will run for decades.
2072040	2075360	I came to the conclusion that physicists are unconsciously acting out
2075360	2078480	like the most prolific historiographic theorists of,
2078480	2080560	like, for example, Reinhard Kozellik,
2080560	2083520	envisioning human beings in historicity on the one hand,
2083520	2087920	hermeneutically tracing patterns of the past by simulating it beforehand,
2087920	2090960	and on the other by constantly pushing the space of experience
2090960	2093720	into horizons of expectation.
2093720	2096600	Physicists love to think of the future.
2096600	2098680	I sometimes wonder whether ever and if,
2098680	2103320	but in addition of anthropology today in 2123,
2103320	2105720	of, for example, anthropology would look like,
2105720	2108880	but physics today exists and that is really fascinating.
2108880	2115160	Physicists are giving up or writing journals
2115160	2118480	and wonder how physics in 100 years' look would look like.
2118480	2123200	Anthropologists, I couldn't imagine any of our discipline
2123280	2128560	being that bold to actually envision anthropology in 100 years.
2132120	2134680	The second degree of uncertainty after the materiality
2134680	2138360	that I just presented to you with a screw may be found in software.
2138360	2140960	Not only lose screws pose danger to the stability
2140960	2143960	of experimental infrastructure, but also bugs,
2143960	2146840	those of the digital kind needless to say.
2146840	2149560	The software used at CERN needs to be programmed,
2149560	2152520	but more importantly, constantly maintained.
2152520	2156000	This daily care defines the work rhythms of high-energy physicists
2156000	2158760	to spend most of their time hunting down bugs
2158760	2161320	and keeping digital storage in order.
2161320	2165760	Individual human visions need to be aligned to reach a common goal.
2165760	2169200	The gathered data on particles stored on farms all over the world
2169200	2173520	is analyzed by collaborations with the help of a network called GRID,
2173520	2175360	which spans the globe.
2175360	2178640	It guarantees that heaps of data can be processed.
2178640	2181360	Since machine learning algorithms help to analyze
2181360	2183800	the pattern recognition of physical events,
2183800	2187720	feeding the nodes with the right input is crucial to the frame
2187720	2189680	to the most surveilled uncertainty
2189680	2192600	within current informatics apparatuses.
2192600	2195000	The X4 factor brought out into the game
2195000	2197680	through artificial intelligences of utmost importance
2197680	2200800	and interest is something I think some of you are dealing with
2200800	2203560	in person also in your work.
2203560	2207680	Each human task is registered by the so-called ticket on GitHub,
2207680	2211080	a software development and management platform.
2211080	2215320	The memory of the task will be gone as soon as the ticket on GitHub
2215320	2218320	is solved and resolved.
2218320	2222040	If the code is working, computers do not need to keep the memory
2222040	2225480	of human actions, do not need to have a trace of historicity
2225480	2229280	how a failure came into being and was resolved.
2229280	2233160	In that sense, bugs produce a certain form of casualty,
2233160	2238320	which happens from case to case, casualité, not causality,
2238320	2241560	from case to case, from one solve ticket to the other.
2241560	2243200	Once the chain of problem is solved,
2243200	2245720	however, there are no casual traces left
2245720	2248800	and so the origins of the bug are forgotten.
2248800	2252080	To keep the otherwise lost socio-technical memory,
2252080	2254320	physicists keep personal lab books,
2254320	2258000	make nodes not unlike anthropologists keep field diaries.
2261520	2263320	Scheming capital M guy.
2264320	2267320	While some people are great in solving bug problems,
2267320	2271320	others seem to be much better in coding bugs into the system,
2271320	2274320	often without being held accountable for their mistakes
2274320	2276320	or causing a pile of additional work
2276320	2280320	by misinterpreting the work schedule.
2280320	2285320	The first ones are usually devoted graduate students
2285320	2288320	who solve the problems and the latter ones,
2288320	2292320	often long time ago grads, older, politically experienced,
2292320	2296320	predominantly white male members of the collaboration.
2296320	2298320	Even in the cosmopolitan experimental group
2298320	2300320	such as the Large Hadron Collider of CERN,
2300320	2302320	where hierarchies are allegedly flat,
2302320	2305320	age, gender, experience and national allegiance matter
2305320	2309320	and people reflect upon this all the time, as I will show now.
2309320	2312320	In hierarchical environments of highly specialized
2312320	2314320	and distributed work spheres,
2314320	2316320	where complex problems need to be solved
2316320	2319320	in short bursts of time and goals reached,
2319320	2323320	human often need to plot, not only scientific diagrams,
2323320	2326320	but also intrigues of all kinds, politics,
2326320	2330320	as you all know who work at the university, matter most.
2330320	2333320	This often happens because leading positions are occupied
2333320	2338320	by older physicists, elderlies, who are politically experienced,
2338320	2341320	but not anymore up to date with the most recent applied work,
2341320	2344320	like programming itself.
2344320	2348320	Anat Singh anthropologist refers to the representatives
2348320	2351320	of these groups as the so-called capital man guy,
2351320	2353320	capital M, big M guy.
2353320	2356320	At CERN, the capital M guys are predominantly,
2356320	2359320	I quote another Harvard professor of particle physics,
2359320	2363320	a female, reasonable European man,
2363320	2365320	adding that she could not breathe at CERN
2365320	2368320	because of their omnipresence.
2368320	2372320	The data-driven world is full of capital M guys.
2372320	2374320	To deal with the amount of uncertainty,
2374320	2377320	they create an armament of strategic tools
2377320	2379320	that need to be brought in to manipulate
2379320	2382320	those experienced power-driven manipulators.
2382320	2385320	It would have even impressed military strategists
2385320	2389320	such as Sun Tzu or Karl von Klausowitz.
2389320	2392320	The trick is to play the game with closed cards,
2392320	2394320	but along the rules at the same time,
2394320	2396320	weaving alliances behind their back
2396320	2398320	and winning the right authorities figures over.
2398320	2401320	So I'm going to show you now how actually
2401320	2404320	what kind of subversive strategies people,
2404320	2406320	PhD students, grad students, deploy
2407320	2409320	to come and reach their goals,
2409320	2412320	although they are not in the power positions.
2415320	2418320	The PhD students at CERN learn to play those double games
2418320	2421320	along with the mastery of code at the same time.
2421320	2424320	The social skills then they are wandering into,
2424320	2425320	and these social skills,
2425320	2426320	and that's fascinating,
2426320	2428320	are wandering into the financially
2428320	2431320	and into the financial and into the technical sectors.
2431320	2433320	So they take what they learn at CERN
2434320	2436320	and bring this kind of work culture
2436320	2437320	into the other work cultures,
2437320	2441320	which are not anymore in science and at the university.
2441320	2443320	I assume each workspace
2443320	2446320	generates its own terroir of scheming,
2446320	2448320	but CERN can be, I quote,
2448320	2449320	a true vipers nest,
2449320	2452320	as physicists with years of experience
2452320	2453320	once said to me,
2453320	2455320	or a cog association,
2455320	2457320	as a female grad student said to another
2457320	2459320	when listening to her latest sister's
2459320	2460320	truce meeting experience.
2460320	2461320	I quote,
2461320	2464320	Interestingly, when I'm talking to male grad students,
2464320	2466320	they all seem not to experience such incidents,
2466320	2469320	but all females have had the same experience.
2469320	2470320	How can you measure something
2470320	2472320	that can't be nailed through worlds?
2472320	2473320	Asks Mia Ferrari,
2473320	2475320	one of my closest interlocutors
2475320	2477320	who turned into a friend of mine later.
2479320	2481320	In supremacist environments,
2481320	2483320	cunningness is the most important virtue.
2483320	2486320	Documenting is documenting is key,
2486320	2489320	and social engineering is an everyday common
2489320	2491320	that starts even before the moments when the gates
2491320	2495320	to the research sites are crossed.
2495320	2497320	The case of Claire.
2497320	2500320	I had the chance to record a small episode
2500320	2502320	demonstrating this daily phenomenon
2502320	2503320	with the help of Claire Covet,
2503320	2505320	a grad student from North America.
2505320	2508320	I promised her to be as vague as possible
2508320	2510320	about the technicalities of her workgroup
2510320	2512320	since the specific community is small,
2512320	2514320	and Covet was, I quote,
2514320	2517320	on the market this fall and graduating next year
2517320	2519320	when I conducted the interview.
2519320	2521320	Claire is working on the upgrade
2521320	2523320	of one of the LHC detectors when I met her
2523320	2525320	and had to guarantee its efficiency
2525320	2527320	for the third season in the game of bosons,
2527320	2529320	as some Cerenes love to call it,
2529320	2532320	when energy and luminosity is about to be increased
2532320	2534320	during the next run of the LHC,
2534320	2537320	which started last year in 2022.
2537320	2539320	In her work, Claire discovered
2539320	2542320	that some calculations had not been made correctly
2542320	2545320	under the guidance of the team leader of her group.
2545320	2547320	He is known for losing his temper
2547320	2550320	and not able to admit a mistake.
2550320	2552320	As a result, she needs to prove
2552320	2554320	the correctness of her calculations
2554320	2557320	and falsify the statements of her peer.
2557320	2560320	But she's not the one that makes the meeting schedules.
2560320	2562320	Her main goal was therefore to make space
2562320	2565320	for her cause during the precious online meetings
2565320	2567320	because she wanted that the system is running,
2567320	2570320	that the experimental system will work at the end.
2570320	2572320	To discuss her case,
2572320	2574320	I met Covet in the upper section
2574320	2576320	of her community building at CERN,
2576320	2578320	in an area that is quite enough
2578320	2580320	for recording and interview
2580320	2583320	and remote enough for not being overheard by anyone.
2583320	2585320	She chose the spot,
2585320	2587320	and whenever someone who looked familiar to her
2587320	2589320	seemed to come closer, she would tone down.
2589320	2591320	I quote.
2593320	2595320	Usually, oh, that's the wrong.
2595320	2597320	Usually you can do it privately.
2597320	2600320	Usually you do not need to do this.
2600320	2603320	This particular guy is known for being difficult.
2603320	2605320	Even now, his strategy in the meeting
2605320	2607320	was to essentially force the issue offline,
2607320	2609320	which we knew would happen.
2609320	2611320	I already talked to the coordinators
2611320	2613320	to get the relevant data to the team in the US
2613320	2615320	so that they could do the calculations
2615320	2617320	and send them back as quickly as possible
2617320	2619320	to this other guy.
2619320	2622320	Solving problems informally and offline
2622320	2624320	means that there are no official records
2624320	2626320	of how and if things are done.
2626320	2629320	The off record space is a dangerous
2629320	2631320	and difficult territory for those
2631320	2633320	who are not having a say.
2633320	2635320	Without heavy weights in the collaboration,
2635320	2637320	nothing can be moved.
2637320	2639320	But it's certainly not less dangerous
2639320	2642320	as any other on the record turf.
2642320	2644320	Claire argues that her boss is someone
2644320	2646320	who needs to be addressed indirectly
2646320	2648320	in a way that she describes as, I quote,
2648320	2650320	backstage work.
2651320	2654320	I knew I had to call out this guy and his team.
2654320	2657320	I had opinions on him from the various people
2657320	2660320	I know from heart rate so they could say
2660320	2662320	what kind of play we had to make.
2662320	2664320	I made sure when to send the slides out
2664320	2666320	and I did not invite him to the meeting
2666320	2669320	but the authorities figures did.
2669320	2671320	The activity coordinators made sure
2671320	2674320	that he would come to the meeting.
2674320	2676320	Claire describes precisely how she had
2676320	2679320	to weave alliances, winning authority figures.
2679320	2681320	The whole plotting took time in consideration
2681320	2683320	that she might have used more effectively
2683320	2686320	for technical problems.
2686320	2688320	I quote, I spread it about a period
2688320	2690320	over two weeks and it took me
2690320	2692320	maybe five hours of work
2692320	2694320	but it is built on something.
2694320	2696320	We have been talking about the coordinate system
2696320	2698320	problem actually a year.
2698320	2700320	I went back into the stack of my notebooks.
2700320	2702320	I flipped back to find the relative facts
2702320	2704320	and I started tracking this problem
2704320	2706320	explicitly in detail on February 14th,
2706320	2708320	2017, presented it
2708320	2711320	on February 14th, 2018.
2711320	2713320	So one year today I made
2713320	2715320	my first measurements of the problem
2715320	2717320	in December 2016 and we had
2717320	2719320	been talking about it since February 2017.
2719320	2721320	So that's the period of time
2721320	2723320	it actually takes
2723320	2725320	to win over
2725320	2727320	when you're coming from the other side.
2727320	2729320	In a language that
2729320	2731320	oscillates between theater,
2731320	2733320	American football
2733320	2735320	and computer game vernacular,
2735320	2737320	Claire describes her social engineering
2737320	2739320	in order to solve a technical problem.
2739320	2741320	She ends the episode by emphasizing
2741320	2743320	that the whole issue has been caused
2743320	2745320	because everyone has so many things to do
2745320	2747320	explaining not without pride
2747320	2749320	how she attracted long-term attention
2749320	2751320	becoming a respectable member of
2751320	2753320	the team despite being a woman.
2755320	2757320	It is less an issue of breakdown
2757320	2759320	and communication and more an issue
2759320	2761320	of priority. People
2761320	2763320	have so many things to do all the time
2763320	2765320	that unless you put something on top of their priority list
2765320	2767320	things will not work. I caused a scene.
2767320	2769320	Now it's in the meeting notes.
2769320	2771320	It has memories.
2771320	2773320	They will not forget a young female graduate
2773320	2775320	student calling out a senior member
2775320	2777320	of the community. That's ballsy.
2777320	2779320	So in doing that I reminded
2779320	2781320	people what happened and I gave
2781320	2783320	the touchdowns.
2783320	2785320	It got to people's memories
2785320	2787320	and next time we will have the meeting.
2787320	2789320	They will ask what has been done
2789320	2791320	with this.
2791320	2793320	That's her workplace.
2793320	2795320	The place of Claire Kovetz
2795320	2797320	chose for telling me the story.
2799320	2801320	The constant control that exercised
2801320	2803320	to check whether we were potentially spotted
2803320	2805320	in the moment. Later on her cleaner
2805320	2807320	to be too precise about her work
2807320	2809320	environment shows in the first place
2809320	2811320	the uncertainty young graduate students are living in
2811320	2813320	when working for a wide reasonable European
2813320	2815320	man and the pressure of high-end
2815320	2817320	institutions such as CERN.
2817320	2819320	It exemplifies the unpredictably
2819320	2821320	and vanity of leading authority
2821320	2823320	figures and how the second and also
2823320	2825320	the thirst and the drive
2825320	2827320	for power and also
2827320	2829320	how the second and third
2829320	2831320	row of workers stabilize the system
2831320	2833320	preventing ruptures and
2833320	2835320	failures caused by the self
2835320	2837320	and tight uncertainty of the capital M guy.
2837320	2839320	Uncertainty
2839320	2841320	is augmented by potential infrastructural
2841320	2843320	ruptures caused by human failed
2843320	2845320	attempt to overcome technical, physical
2845320	2847320	or social obstacles.
2847320	2849320	Synchronization, prioritization
2849320	2851320	and the right rhythm
2851320	2853320	to cut and resume communication
2853320	2855320	in order to install a memory
2855320	2857320	of an action seem to be
2857320	2859320	essential in securing position and
2859320	2861320	balancing the common goal of the collaboration
2861320	2863320	and that has nothing
2863320	2865320	interestingly enough to do with the kind of
2865320	2867320	rhythms and memories of the computer.
2867320	2869320	Preventing ruptures
2869320	2871320	means circumventing and uncertainties
2871320	2873320	means to exchange individuality
2873320	2875320	against what I call intraviguality.
2875320	2877320	CERN's case
2877320	2879320	in the end was solved successfully.
2879320	2881320	In her little area
2881320	2883320	of caring concern everything was fine
2883320	2885320	and on time once the LHC
2885320	2887320	started in the season
2887320	2889320	last year in 2022.
2889320	2891320	Since we had our conversation
2891320	2893320	that I shared with you today
2893320	2895320	Claire got a prestigious postdoc position
2895320	2897320	at an American elite university
2897320	2899320	and is now an assistant professor
2899320	2901320	at a renowned university in Europe.
2901320	2903320	Her ability to become an intravigual
2903320	2905320	her cunningness and consistency
2905320	2907320	her notes, calculations and devotion
2907320	2909320	and a big portion of chance
2909320	2911320	secured her a place in the future of high
2911320	2913320	energy physics.
2915320	2917320	Awards in anthropology in the future.
2919320	2921320	Screws as hardware and bugs
2921320	2923320	as software may be considered agents
2923320	2925320	of ruptures, schemers of cuts.
2925320	2927320	They may be seen as vital forces
2927320	2929320	shaping human dynamics in a data
2929320	2931320	driven work environment.
2931320	2933320	Scheming intrigues, plots and weaving
2933320	2935320	the future in the now by dealing
2935320	2937320	cunningly with collective group memory
2937320	2939320	and gaining attention for future
2939320	2941320	actions turns into a political tool.
2941320	2943320	Differentiating between cuts
2943320	2945320	and ruptures helps to distinguish
2945320	2947320	between different modes of action
2947320	2949320	and physically different actors as
2949320	2951320	I learned from and with my colleague
2951320	2953320	Lucas Meyerhofer physicist himself.
2953320	2955320	It visualizes that hardware, software
2955320	2957320	and humans are in seemingly seamless
2957320	2959320	spaces always on the verge of disruption.
2959320	2961320	It shows how people care
2961320	2963320	within and about data driven worlds
2963320	2965320	and above all it exemplifies
2965320	2967320	that actions are happening in the
2967320	2969320	fields of social forces
2969320	2971320	and how the discurface structures
2971320	2973320	influence actions especially actions
2973320	2975320	in the digital era.
2975320	2977320	It shows how we evolved from individuals
2977320	2979320	to individuals to
2979320	2981320	intraviduals when living in our complex
2981320	2983320	digital worlds.
2983320	2985320	Anthropology as I understand
2985320	2987320	our crafty discipline is bound
2987320	2989320	to empirical insights
2989320	2991320	but as well to theoretical concepts
2991320	2993320	no matter how much we put empirical
2993320	2995320	fields in our inventory powers at the
2995320	2997320	center and it matters what thoughts
2997320	2999320	I am thinking and with whom I am
2999320	3001320	thinking my thoughts with as Donna
3001320	3003320	Haraway reminds us.
3003320	3005320	No matter how much we understand
3005320	3007320	the discursive structures of truthful
3007320	3009320	dispositions, no matter how much we
3009320	3011320	are tricked by unconscious drives
3011320	3013320	language is the trickster
3013320	3015320	and sound can play with meaning.
3015320	3017320	Alterity is key
3017320	3019320	the rhythm changes everything
3019320	3021320	communication is misunderstanding
3021320	3023320	and eps cons from economies
3023320	3025320	of growth. Alterity
3025320	3027320	is key.
3027320	3029320	Thinking about a future that does
3029320	3031320	not forget where we are coming from
3031320	3033320	but understands the horizons
3033320	3035320	of our Indo-European spatiotemporal
3035320	3037320	housings and movements.
3037320	3039320	So where we and how we talk
3039320	3041320	and how we frame things
3041320	3043320	allows us to recalibrate our own
3043320	3045320	being on the planet and asks
3045320	3047320	how we transform from humans into
3047320	3049320	something we could consider as Terrence.
3049320	3051320	Since I am convinced that
3051320	3053320	at the core of our problems within
3053320	3055320	the Anthropocene lies our ways
3055320	3057320	of how we perceive space, time and
3057320	3059320	materiality and that is very closely
3059320	3061320	tied to our Indo-European language
3061320	3063320	system. There are other ways
3063320	3065320	to be in the future and we
3065320	3067320	as anthropologists are looking for
3067320	3069320	traces that lead us there.
3069320	3071320	I want to visualize this
3071320	3073320	by sharing with you some diagrams
3073320	3075320	I made. One inspired through
3075320	3077320	re-reading Nikolai Sorin-Tchaikov's
3077320	3079320	Two Lenins, a brief anthropology of time
3079320	3081320	and the other contemporary
3081320	3083320	works in anthropology that
3083320	3085320	I try to engage with
3085320	3087320	two
3087320	3089320	philosophers that I really admire
3089320	3091320	very much, Maurice Meloponte
3091320	3093320	and Jacques Derrida.
3093320	3095320	So in this you can actually
3095320	3097320	see it's like a babushka model
3097320	3099320	an onion model of how
3099320	3101320	we are engaging
3101320	3103320	with temporalities and there are different
3103320	3105320	ideas of temporality. There's the geopolitical
3105320	3107320	temporality or time that you see
3107320	3109320	on the outside in the black
3109320	3111320	frame and then there's the violet frame
3111320	3113320	you could say it's a media technological
3113320	3115320	dispositive or apparatus
3115320	3117320	that is also creating a certain
3117320	3119320	temporality and rhythm.
3119320	3121320	These rhythms are going along with each other
3121320	3123320	they create already a certain resonance
3123320	3125320	a certain form of harmony. Then you have
3125320	3127320	a certain temporality, the thought
3127320	3129320	styles and the epistemic ways
3129320	3131320	of being together so different thought
3131320	3133320	collectives to put it with Ludwig Fleck
3133320	3135320	who have again their own temporality
3135320	3137320	and then you have the yellow
3137320	3139320	frame which is the experimental time
3139320	3141320	so time of the experiment of the Large Hadron Collider
3141320	3143320	where a certain amount of data is taking
3143320	3145320	within the time and the fourth
3145320	3147320	is actually the knowledge that is
3147320	3149320	coming out of this so the gift
3149320	3151320	of nature that is appearing
3151320	3153320	within the collision of the experiment
3153320	3155320	itself. So all these different
3155320	3157320	layers of temporality are intersecting
3157320	3159320	and in between you have the materiality
3159320	3161320	that maybe cuts and you have the
3161320	3163320	politics that happening and that's the rhythm
3163320	3165320	and that's the bead itself
3165320	3167320	that actually is so interesting to
3167320	3169320	understand and to describe in anthropology
3169320	3171320	itself.
3171320	3173320	And on the other hand
3173320	3175320	you can see here that's a very classical
3175320	3177320	imaginary actually
3177320	3179320	how Maurice Maloponte tried to
3179320	3181320	show how the past is an
3181320	3183320	overlay, it's overlaid
3183320	3185320	by different present times.
3185320	3187320	So you have here
3187320	3189320	the black
3189320	3191320	and red line which is
3191320	3193320	the timeline, the physical timeline
3193320	3195320	and that we have in the Newtonian
3195320	3197320	world and the blue
3197320	3199320	lines are actually the cuts
3199320	3201320	of the now when you go back
3201320	3203320	and the black lines that go
3203320	3205320	diagonal
3205320	3207320	through the blue lines are showing that
3207320	3209320	actually each spot when you would
3209320	3211320	go into the past are an overlay
3211320	3213320	of endlessly amounts of
3213320	3215320	past time points of the now
3215320	3217320	so that shows what I said initially
3217320	3219320	how complex the capturing
3219320	3221320	of the past actually is for historiography.
3221320	3223320	And on the other hand
3223320	3225320	when you do physics and we do this
3225320	3227320	hermeneutical cuts as anthropologists
3227320	3229320	and the historians when we are
3229320	3231320	looking into the past.
3231320	3233320	But on the other hand, physicists are trying
3233320	3235320	to push this kind of
3235320	3237320	experience, space of experience
3237320	3239320	when they simulate experiments
3239320	3241320	beforehand
3241320	3243320	and push the experiential space
3243320	3245320	of the experiment into the future
3245320	3247320	and have these two
3247320	3249320	horizons. On the one hand
3249320	3251320	the horizon of theory and on the other hand
3251320	3253320	the horizon of the experiment itself.
3253320	3255320	And to see this kind of
3255320	3257320	congruence with between thinking how
3257320	3259320	physicists and computer science
3259320	3261320	actually makes us and allows us to rethink
3261320	3263320	the horizons of future is
3263320	3265320	something that I find very fruitful for my own
3265320	3267320	discipline and where I learned a lot of
3267320	3269320	physics and computer science and such.
3271320	3273320	I did this to remind at the end
3273320	3275320	of this talk diagrammatically that it does not
3275320	3277320	only matter with whom we are thinking
3277320	3279320	thoughts with but also what kind of
3279320	3281320	geometries, architectures, diagrams
3281320	3283320	and compositions we build when we approach
3283320	3285320	any phenomenon including the
3285320	3287320	futures and futurities.
3287320	3289320	And also in order to question whether some of
3289320	3291320	the new materialist
3291320	3293320	conceptions about future are actually
3293320	3295320	that new.
3295320	3297320	Karen Barad's quantum mechanically inspired
3297320	3299320	concept of interaction harmonizes
3299320	3301320	with historiographical theories
3301320	3303320	very well who by definition
3303320	3305320	aim to reconsider space, time, materiality
3305320	3307320	humans and non-humans alike
3307320	3309320	and how things come into being.
3309320	3311320	When it comes to study futures
3311320	3313320	we need to work with what we have now
3313320	3315320	and what we find here.
3315320	3317320	We are not living in eternal time-free
3317320	3319320	space a place the Greeks called
3319320	3321320	Koura filled with eternal
3321320	3323320	Aion, the Ian, the eternal.
3323320	3325320	We are mortals in this whole game
3325320	3327320	depending on chance, kairos,
3327320	3329320	luck. No matter how much we travel
3329320	3331320	beyond space and time.
3331320	3333320	At CERN I observed solitary beings of all
3333320	3335320	kind interacting and becoming
3335320	3337320	solitary beings which brings me
3337320	3339320	back to the tree I observed 12 years ago
3339320	3341320	in Vienna. The observer
3341320	3343320	me in the window acknowledged exclusive
3343320	3345320	moments of each leaf but
3345320	3347320	the summer wind just as historical time
3347320	3349320	touched all of us.
3349320	3351320	As part of one tree these leaves
3351320	3353320	are part of one universal.
3353320	3355320	I as observer was audience.
3355320	3357320	We together were a many world
3357320	3359320	already. I listened
3359320	3361320	to the sound of leaves
3361320	3363320	they brought me to CERN
3363320	3365320	and this place to understand what our task
3365320	3367320	in virtue as anthropologists is
3367320	3369320	when we are doing fieldwork.
3369320	3371320	That we are sniffling futures.
3371320	3373320	Our binding leaves through words and finding
3373320	3375320	traces with forests by summoning
3375320	3377320	space and time without
3377320	3379320	imperial aims by piecing fragments
3379320	3381320	together a part into a unitary
3381320	3383320	multiplicity.
3383320	3385320	The modernity, the individual, the
3385320	3387320	digitality and the future
3387320	3389320	is about individual individuality.
3389320	3391320	Is the old blind
3391320	3393320	in the anthropocene?
3393320	3395320	Today, anthropology
3395320	3397320	no matter what field it engage in
3397320	3399320	is an historically aware discipline.
3399320	3401320	That's why it's about
3401320	3403320	when you think of current debates on
3403320	3405320	restitution of artifacts
3405320	3407320	stolen within colonial context maybe this
3407320	3409320	happens also in Brussels. It matters
3409320	3411320	how you gather your knowledge
3411320	3413320	and I do not steal from people at CERN.
3413320	3415320	They do exactly know what I'm doing there
3415320	3417320	and they're sharing with me because
3417320	3419320	they know I care for them and they care for me.
3419320	3421320	And it's important
3421320	3423320	to know who has a say or the right
3423320	3425320	for a history of her own.
3425320	3427320	For what has happened to the pyramids what will
3427320	3429320	be. In times of
3429320	3431320	reconsidering apocal cuts in historical
3431320	3433320	rhythmizations due to the anthropocene
3433320	3435320	anthropologists have to roam all fields
3435320	3437320	as trailblazing tracers.
3439320	3441320	I presented you scenes of vulnerability
3441320	3443320	all of them physical, one
3443320	3445320	material, the screw, the other virtual
3445320	3447320	the bugs and the third a discursive one
3447320	3449320	which I framed in the term of
3449320	3451320	masculinity and subversive actions.
3451320	3453320	I tell you ethnographic fictions
3453320	3455320	of science based on empirical
3455320	3457320	encounters to set your minds in places
3457320	3459320	to open horizons of experience
3459320	3461320	to take you along my
3461320	3463320	storytelling and leave you
3463320	3465320	to your own horizons of experience
3465320	3467320	to engage in empathy and taking
3467320	3469320	the others point of view. For that matters
3469320	3471320	matters more than any
3471320	3473320	property or appropriation
3473320	3475320	in fights, any kind
3475320	3477320	of neoliberal
3477320	3479320	dispositive of existence we are actually
3479320	3481320	all the time treadmilling in.
3481320	3483320	We anthropologists are collaborators
3483320	3485320	in exchanges, translators
3485320	3487320	and voice gippers. We acknowledge
3487320	3489320	respect and the value of the other
3489320	3491320	as discipline a priori.
3491320	3493320	We learned it the hard way
3493320	3495320	for empathy is the evergreen
3495320	3497320	of world of many worlds.
3497320	3499320	Think like a stone long with
3499320	3501320	Beth Provenelli or like a
3501320	3503320	margulis.
3503320	3505320	Think like a mushroom along with
3505320	3507320	anatzin or like vertebrae
3507320	3509320	in companionship with Donna Haraway.
3509320	3511320	See the world from a quantum perspective
3511320	3513320	together with Karen Barat
3513320	3515320	but let those things in their
3515320	3517320	thinness, those beings in their
3517320	3519320	beingness be themselves and
3519320	3521320	relate as Helen Verand does.
3521320	3523320	Take the aliens point of view
3523320	3525320	and acknowledge the own alien within
3525320	3527320	yourself. Be an interdependent
3527320	3529320	member of Arturo Escobar's
3529320	3531320	pluriverse and acknowledge your
3531320	3533320	individuality along with the
3533320	3535320	physicists of my field.
3535320	3537320	I finished this talk with the
3537320	3539320	question I would love to discuss with you
3539320	3541320	and hints of positivist
3541320	3543320	teleology put aside and
3543320	3545320	that I learned today to ask in
3545320	3547320	and through physics. What could
3547320	3549320	an interdisciplinary
3549320	3551320	collaboration look like in 21-23
3551320	3553320	and how would you
3553320	3555320	folks think an interdisciplinary
3555320	3557320	collaboration across cultures
3557320	3559320	of knowledge would be useful
3559320	3561320	and fruitful.
3561320	3563320	Thank you very much.
3565320	3567320	Thank you, Ann.
3567320	3569320	Is it okay that we close this
3569320	3571320	screen sure that we see each other?
3571320	3573320	Everybody sees everybody?
3573320	3575320	Will it make sense? Okay,
3575320	3577320	that's nice. Just let me
3577320	3579320	open this on the...
3579320	3581320	How do I do that?
3587320	3589320	Thank you
3589320	3591320	for your patience.
3591320	3593320	It was 10 minutes overdue
3593320	3595320	but I hope you didn't lose the
3595320	3597320	attention.
3597320	3599320	We are all here. So who would like
3599320	3601320	to start commenting question?
3601320	3603320	Francis. And let's use
3603320	3605320	the mic in the row.
3605320	3607320	Well, I would like to
3607320	3609320	make a very provocative statement
3609320	3611320	but before I do so
3611320	3613320	I will introduce myself in order to make it
3613320	3615320	a little bit less provocative.
3615320	3617320	I'm the director here
3617320	3619320	of the Centre-Layer Postal.
3619320	3621320	I very much agree
3621320	3623320	with people like Karen Barat
3623320	3625320	about intra-action.
3625320	3627320	I've been studying quantum mechanics.
3627320	3629320	I've been developing an ontology
3629320	3631320	that I call relational agency
3631320	3633320	that can be used for post-humanism.
3633320	3635320	So I all agree
3635320	3637320	about different agency,
3637320	3639320	about diversity, about
3639320	3641320	the fact that an institute
3641320	3643320	like a CERN should be
3643320	3645320	as diverse as possible.
3645320	3647320	But now comes my provocative statement
3647320	3649320	that is that your analysis to me
3649320	3651320	sounds quite racist
3651320	3653320	and sexist
3653320	3655320	because you are analysing
3655320	3657320	an ordinary event
3657320	3659320	a younger junior person
3659320	3661320	who points out a mistake in some
3661320	3663320	senior person and the senior person
3663320	3665320	not immediately picking it up or not
3665320	3667320	being very happy to hear about that
3667320	3669320	to me that seems like
3669320	3671320	general anthropology
3671320	3673320	that would happen in any context
3673320	3675320	white or black, masculine
3675320	3677320	or feminine
3677320	3679320	science or non-science
3679320	3681320	if some younger member
3681320	3683320	of a tribe would question
3683320	3685320	an indigenous elder
3685320	3687320	that would also not be taken as seriously
3687320	3689320	what happened to Clare Covert
3689320	3691320	as far as I understood was nothing bad
3691320	3693320	she just was not immediately
3693320	3695320	listened to. I think
3695320	3697320	these kind of events happen all the time
3697320	3699320	in all circumstances
3699320	3701320	that this is a masculine
3701320	3703320	white European environment
3703320	3705320	is actually making
3705320	3707320	a racist and sexist assumption
3707320	3709320	namely that in non-white
3709320	3711320	non-European, non-masculine
3711320	3713320	environments this would not happen
3713320	3715320	imagine that you would have said
3715320	3717320	this is an environment
3717320	3719320	with mostly Jews
3719320	3721320	and this thing happened there
3721320	3723320	people would immediately tell you
3723320	3725320	that you are an anti-Semite
3725320	3727320	but if you say they are white European males
3727320	3729320	somehow it is considered to be
3729320	3731320	non-racist, non-sexist
3731320	3733320	well I think it is
3735320	3737320	yeah thank you very much
3737320	3739320	I think there must be a basic misunderstanding
3739320	3741320	because I have been quoting people
3741320	3743320	I have been quoting and framing
3743320	3745320	what people were saying
3745320	3747320	so it's not me who says that
3747320	3749320	but it's actually the statement of the people themselves
3749320	3751320	they were calling it
3751320	3753320	in these terms
3753320	3755320	I have been just quoting
3755320	3757320	and if you consider rightfully
3757320	3759320	this as racist and sexist
3759320	3761320	then you have to call out
3761320	3763320	these women who
3763320	3765320	perceive it that way
3765320	3767320	so it's not me, I am just here the modest witness
3767320	3769320	of their quotations
3769320	3771320	and what was of concern to them
3771320	3773320	you could
3773320	3775320	definitely push this back
3775320	3777320	and I perceive this also
3777320	3779320	as a pushback
3779320	3781320	but
3781320	3783320	I just can tell you
3783320	3785320	this is just one little piece
3785320	3787320	of data of many many many
3787320	3789320	and
3789320	3791320	if people from the US
3791320	3793320	would perceive a certain style
3793320	3795320	of reasoning in Europe predominant
3795320	3797320	and voice this in
3797320	3799320	records it's not me who came up with this
3799320	3801320	it's not me who
3801320	3803320	is bringing this into
3803320	3805320	so yes it is racist
3805320	3807320	yes it is sexist but that's
3807320	3809320	the data of the people
3809320	3811320	and not my own quotation
3811320	3813320	and if people are perceiving
3813320	3815320	what you were saying this is something
3815320	3817320	if you downplaying actually you are downplaying
3817320	3819320	Claire
3819320	3821320	because for Claire this was very traumatic
3821320	3823320	and she is a PhD student
3823320	3825320	and that really concerned her
3825320	3827320	and I have been spending time with her
3827320	3829320	sitting at the restaurant and many people have spent time
3829320	3831320	with her and she couldn't sleep
3831320	3833320	and she had heart race beating
3833320	3835320	very strongly
3835320	3837320	to meet this person
3837320	3839320	that she was frightened on because he would really scream
3839320	3841320	within the team meetings
3841320	3843320	and so
3843320	3845320	actually I just perceive
3845320	3847320	I don't think that you just simply got
3847320	3849320	the initial
3849320	3851320	thing I'm on your side
3851320	3853320	but actually that's the data
3853320	3855320	if you say this is not this is something very
3855320	3857320	common she has been hurt she had to plot
3857320	3859320	and if you're
3859320	3861320	then I have to say to you provocatively
3861320	3863320	that you actually take the master's perspective
3863320	3865320	of the head of an institution
3865320	3867320	who is not seeing how those
3867320	3869320	people who are servants behind your back
3869320	3871320	are actually playing you all the time
3871320	3873320	that would be my
3873320	3875320	provocative reply to you because
3875320	3877320	really that's not my data that's not my words
3877320	3879320	that's not my framing that's the framing of the people
3879320	3881320	I have been working with and that's not
3881320	3883320	a tribe
3883320	3885320	that is calling out in elderly
3885320	3887320	but these are physicists and that's
3887320	3889320	a quite a reductionist
3889320	3891320	comparison
3891320	3893320	and also playing down the complexities
3893320	3895320	of what we call and do not anymore
3895320	3897320	actually called tribal societies
3897320	3899320	sorry
3899320	3901320	well I
3901320	3903320	I believe that what you described
3903320	3905320	that I very much understand that
3905320	3907320	somebody would be traumatized I have
3907320	3909320	had similar experiences
3909320	3911320	both in the case of myself
3911320	3913320	not being listened to
3913320	3915320	by an elderly when I was younger
3915320	3917320	and vice versa
3917320	3919320	I think these things happen all the time
3919320	3921320	and they are traumatic but they are part
3921320	3923320	of human nature
3923320	3925320	implying that it's only
3925320	3927320	white males who do it I think is
3927320	3929320	very unrealistic
3929320	3931320	the white males it will be
3931320	3933320	we are on the same side
3933320	3935320	my dear I also do not think
3935320	3937320	that it's just like a male white thing
3937320	3939320	that's how these people perceive it
3939320	3941320	and that's interesting as a symptom
3941320	3943320	doesn't mean that it's the reality
3943320	3945320	that's how these people perceive it
3945320	3947320	and actually the question is
3947320	3949320	why do they perceive it that way
3949320	3951320	why do young women in physics
3951320	3953320	perceive it this way
3953320	3955320	why would they actually
3955320	3957320	be sexist and call it out
3957320	3959320	and we have
3959320	3961320	also at CERN there's something we call
3961320	3963320	the queen bee phenomenon
3963320	3965320	you maybe know it from physics or from any other field
3965320	3967320	so it's saying that there are few
3967320	3969320	women who have come up in leading positions
3969320	3971320	and they are queen bees
3971320	3973320	that means they can work very well together with
3973320	3975320	men but not so well with women
3975320	3977320	and they are killing other bee queens
3977320	3979320	and at CERN you could study
3979320	3981320	for example also very well the queen bee phenomenon
3981320	3983320	and
3983320	3985320	as I just said that's the death question
3985320	3987320	and I just provocatively
3987320	3989320	provocatively put it into you
3989320	3991320	but
3991320	3993320	as the so-called
3993320	3995320	diversity and
3995320	3997320	gender equality representative
3997320	3999320	of the philosophical faculty of my university
3999320	4001320	I can tell you women
4001320	4003320	and men play the same games and it doesn't matter
4003320	4005320	what kind of religion, race, class
4005320	4007320	ethnicity they have as a background
4007320	4009320	doesn't matter
4009320	4011320	but still that's the sources and CERN
4011320	4013320	has to deal with this
4013320	4015320	and also what I find
4015320	4017320	interesting and you know that's not what I want to talk about
4017320	4019320	what I find interesting is the more interesting part
4019320	4021320	is to put this
4021320	4023320	aside and get away
4023320	4025320	from this kind of how they perceive it
4025320	4027320	be it the capital M guy
4027320	4029320	and blaming men and blaming whiteness
4029320	4031320	whatever I don't care I just
4031320	4033320	don't think that's useful for us
4033320	4035320	what I found fascinating is how she actually
4035320	4037320	tries to solve a problem
4037320	4039320	and steps back from
4039320	4041320	her individual perspective
4041320	4043320	acknowledges there's a certain leading figure
4043320	4045320	who cannot step away
4045320	4047320	from his individual's narcissist needs
4047320	4049320	and becomes an
4049320	4051320	individual playing along
4051320	4053320	with other people together
4053320	4055320	to come to a common goal and to reach it
4055320	4057320	as you did when you were actually young
4057320	4059320	and that's something where I think
4059320	4061320	what you initially called the relational agency
4061320	4063320	and the post humanist
4063320	4065320	diversity that you're engaging with
4065320	4067320	is something that you actually embodied
4067320	4069320	as a sensitive young
4069320	4071320	man who did research and experienced
4071320	4073320	the same traumatic downplaying
4073320	4075320	as Claire in her case
4075320	4077320	gendered in your case not gendered
4079320	4081320	well in my case
4081320	4083320	actually I have been downplayed
4083320	4085320	by women professors when I was young
4085320	4087320	but so I don't mind
4087320	4089320	it doesn't matter the gender
4089320	4091320	is not relevant everybody plays these
4091320	4093320	political games as soon as they get in
4093320	4095320	a position of power
4095320	4097320	I really don't think that
4097320	4099320	whiteness, Europeaness
4099320	4101320	or gender plays a role
4101320	4103320	all situations where there is
4103320	4105320	an ability to move up in
4105320	4107320	a power hierarchy they play political games
4107320	4109320	which means that the ones at the higher level
4109320	4111320	of the hierarchy don't like to be
4111320	4113320	criticised by the ones lower on
4113320	4115320	it's universal I don't think it needs
4115320	4117320	to be gendered or Europeanized
4117320	4119320	or muscularized or whatever
4119320	4121320	you have to say this
4121320	4123320	to the people I did research with
4123320	4125320	and not to me I mean like that's not my point
4125320	4127320	it's not I
4127320	4129320	I don't think that it has to be gendered
4129320	4131320	I just said to you I think
4131320	4133320	it doesn't matter who does this people love
4133320	4135320	power plays no matter
4135320	4137320	but then that's the
4137320	4139320	data I just gathered
4139320	4141320	it's the data it's not me
4141320	4143320	I'm just
4143320	4145320	the modest witness here and that's the part
4145320	4147320	of the field that I didn't construct but I try
4147320	4149320	to show you as an anthropologist is actually
4149320	4150320	how
4150320	4152320	individuality comes into being
4152320	4154320	how although hierarchy is
4154320	4156320	preventing a certain functioning
4156320	4158320	individual interacting
4158320	4160320	and engagement in your times
4160320	4162320	a relational agency
4162320	4164320	is allowing that things at the end work out
4164320	4166320	so
4176320	4178320	so we have 40s and then
4178320	4180320	Schema 40s
4182320	4184320	I cannot
4186320	4188320	40s you are muted
4189320	4191320	not connected to Mike
4194320	4196320	so
4200320	4202320	okay so maybe we move to Schema
4202320	4204320	and meanwhile you will figure it out okay
4204320	4206320	for this
4206320	4208320	can you hear me
4208320	4210320	yes yes
4210320	4212320	thank you very much for your
4212320	4214320	interesting presentation
4214320	4216320	I wonder if you
4216320	4218320	can elaborate a little bit on
4218320	4220320	some sort of like incentive models
4220320	4222320	that you think can be put into place
4222320	4224320	for promoting
4224320	4226320	this kind of like
4226320	4228320	intra individualization
4228320	4230320	especially in interdisciplinary research
4230320	4232320	because most of the problems we are facing right now
4232320	4234320	you rightly also mentioned
4234320	4236320	in your presentation
4236320	4238320	are so complex that I think
4238320	4240320	we need to move toward this kind of
4240320	4242320	perspective
4242320	4244320	though I also want to say like
4244320	4246320	some part of like this
4246320	4248320	profile of mail
4248320	4250320	I think it's kind of present
4250320	4252320	in some disciplines
4252320	4254320	especially like STEM sciences I'm coming from
4254320	4256320	that background
4256320	4258320	I can see why these women probably
4258320	4260320	would witness this kind of like incidents
4260320	4262320	do I want to move
4262320	4264320	toward this kind of incentive models
4264320	4266320	like what kind of environment
4266320	4268320	what kind of like
4268320	4270320	team or
4270320	4272320	arrangements
4272320	4274320	should be put into place from your research
4274320	4276320	that can kind of promote
4276320	4278320	this kind of
4278320	4280320	approach and at the same time
4280320	4282320	if this is
4282320	4284320	like power dynamic
4284320	4286320	dynamics emerge from
4286320	4288320	somebody having more experiences
4288320	4290320	or having a different socio
4290320	4292320	technological
4292320	4294320	social background
4294320	4296320	what kind of like mechanisms
4296320	4298320	needs to be in place to prevent
4298320	4300320	the
4300320	4302320	power dynamics taking over
4302320	4304320	positive
4304320	4306320	collaborations thank you very much
4306320	4308320	thank you Shima
4308320	4310320	for these very fundamental questions
4310320	4312320	and I have been dealing with these questions myself
4312320	4314320	I just I hope
4314320	4316320	I can give you some of those
4316320	4318320	my thoughts that I think that would be useful
4318320	4320320	but that's just like hypothetical
4320320	4322320	what I would wish
4322320	4324320	so the good thing and the good news
4324320	4326320	about CERN is that it works very well
4326320	4328320	and what they did actually that it works
4328320	4330320	is that they were implementing
4330320	4332320	game theory elements
4332320	4334320	so certain type of competitiveness
4334320	4336320	within the work collaborations
4336320	4338320	and there are different styles
4338320	4340320	the Atlas collaboration who is
4340320	4342320	flatter in its hierarchy
4342320	4344320	and there's the CMS collaboration
4344320	4346320	which is more competitive and more hierarchical
4346320	4348320	so even there there are differences of course
4348320	4350320	and there are more or less
4350320	4352320	hierarchical
4352320	4354320	correlations and situations
4354320	4356320	so one cannot give one solution to all
4356320	4358320	and this kind of specific
4358320	4360320	sample that you showed I showed to you
4360320	4362320	is an example of I don't like
4362320	4364320	the term but I use it of a toxic
4364320	4366320	work group so a work group that doesn't function well
4366320	4368320	but of course there are also
4368320	4370320	work groups that function well
4370320	4372320	and I studied these work groups where it functioned well
4372320	4374320	when did it function well
4374320	4376320	it functioned well when first
4376320	4378320	there was a good communication between
4378320	4380320	the authority figures
4380320	4382320	the so-called leaders of the teams
4382320	4384320	and the PhD students and the early postdocs
4384320	4386320	and that was always
4386320	4388320	the case when the team leaders were
4388320	4390320	still also being part
4390320	4392320	of the programming
4392320	4394320	and also engaged in the
4394320	4396320	updates and upgrades and constantly
4396320	4398320	tried to go
4398320	4400320	along with the time so not becoming
4400320	4402320	just older and experience in politics
4402320	4404320	but also still knowing what
4404320	4406320	actually the younger ones doing when programming
4406320	4408320	and solving the problems on the code
4408320	4410320	so it actually asks
4410320	4412320	from the authority figures to say close
4412320	4414320	to what the younger ones do
4414320	4416320	that's one side and the other side
4416320	4418320	what I think that would be really good
4418320	4420320	on the long run would be
4420320	4422320	actually
4422320	4424320	a certain form of
4424320	4426320	social
4426320	4428320	therapeutic work groups where people are able
4428320	4430320	to say what they actually feel like
4430320	4432320	because if you ask
4432320	4434320	the guy that Claire
4434320	4436320	is calling out who is
4436320	4438320	problematic and who is this
4438320	4440320	authority figure that she says
4440320	4442320	it's a white male guy of Europe
4442320	4444320	if you ask this guy
4444320	4446320	who I think by his origin is German
4446320	4448320	if you ask this guy why he's
4448320	4450320	so choleric and screaming all the time
4450320	4452320	and cannot allow mistakes
4452320	4454320	cannot admit mistakes
4454320	4456320	you might see if he would
4456320	4458320	have time that he would say oh I have so
4458320	4460320	much responsibility to take
4460320	4462320	nobody listens to me I feel
4462320	4464320	I'm lost here I'm overworked there
4464320	4466320	and so on and so on so actually
4466320	4468320	it's a certain mode of taking
4468320	4470320	back which I would think would be very
4470320	4472320	useful for everybody of us working in
4472320	4474320	science and at universities
4474320	4476320	in general and that's something that's
4476320	4478320	missing a certain form of
4478320	4480320	mediation a certain form of
4480320	4482320	acknowledging the others that's what I also said at the
4482320	4484320	end you know listening to the other person
4484320	4486320	taking the other one's point of view also
4486320	4488320	what now the director
4488320	4490320	of Claire was saying I mean like what
4490320	4492320	you're saying is exactly what I wish
4492320	4494320	would be something that would be
4494320	4496320	implemented so this kind of
4496320	4498320	contained groups where people
4498320	4500320	could work with each other
4500320	4502320	so I think that would be something
4502320	4504320	as a that
4504320	4506320	would need to be implemented because
4506320	4508320	the pressure is so high
4508320	4510320	and on the other hand
4510320	4512320	what's very interesting and I think what would
4512320	4514320	be very useful is if you talk to people at CERN
4514320	4516320	I did talk to the psychologists at CERN
4516320	4518320	and if and
4518320	4520320	they have records they do not get everybody
4520320	4522320	but they have statistics
4522320	4524320	of the amount of anxieties of sleeplessness
4524320	4526320	as a really like
4526320	4528320	psychological psychosomatic
4528320	4530320	symptoms that appear within
4530320	4532320	a certain
4532320	4534320	high level research
4534320	4536320	environment and
4536320	4538320	I think what would really help to just
4538320	4540320	use all the technologies we have
4540320	4542320	from psychological therapeutics
4542320	4544320	to just implement this as mandatory
4544320	4546320	way of self-care
4546320	4548320	and also group care and then it would
4548320	4550320	definitely work better
4550320	4552320	but when it comes to the
4552320	4554320	fundamental exclusion of
4554320	4556320	certain groups who are privileged
4556320	4558320	or less privileged
4558320	4560320	then it really needs at least in the
4560320	4562320	German case we would need definitely
4562320	4564320	to support more people from working class
4564320	4566320	environments and so on from early on
4566320	4568320	and to change the whole curriculum
4568320	4570320	from early on to have a different standpoint
4570320	4572320	of how
4572320	4574320	those STEM fields are
4574320	4576320	taught
4576320	4578320	I hope this answers a little bit Shima
4578320	4580320	could you give me a small feedback
4580320	4582320	whether this is a bit helpful
4582320	4584320	Yes, it's very interesting
4584320	4586320	thank you very much for
4586320	4588320	an elaborate answer
4588320	4590320	I think
4590320	4592320	what I see is that probably
4592320	4594320	the kind of mix of highly competitive
4594320	4596320	environments and
4596320	4598320	I think to some extent also
4598320	4600320	maybe so more men
4600320	4602320	are actually present in STEM fields
4602320	4604320	this is kind of like statistics are out there
4604320	4606320	nobody can basically
4606320	4608320	ignore them more men are actually
4608320	4610320	attracted to these fields
4610320	4612320	not just because the field
4612320	4614320	promotes men I think it's kind of
4614320	4616320	something that is there are so many
4616320	4618320	complex reasons that are happening
4618320	4620320	that are there that actually causing
4620320	4622320	women
4622320	4624320	choosing other fields rather than STEM
4624320	4626320	fields and I think
4626320	4628320	in any kind of field when you have
4628320	4630320	this proportionate gender representation
4630320	4632320	you can get into some sort of
4632320	4634320	like a maladaptive
4634320	4636320	dynamics so I think
4636320	4638320	this is kind of like
4638320	4640320	promoting more women and I think
4640320	4642320	what you mentioned I think listening is very
4642320	4644320	important I really liked what you mentioned
4644320	4646320	bringing more of these
4646320	4648320	critical skills like listening, empathy
4648320	4650320	and putting yourself in somebody
4650320	4652320	else's perspective is I think so fundamental
4652320	4654320	in technical fields
4654320	4656320	and thank you very much for your
4656320	4658320	very interesting presentation
4658320	4660320	thank you
4660320	4662320	Thank you Shima, just one little thing I want to add
4662320	4664320	I asked the leading also
4664320	4666320	the director general
4666320	4668320	back then at CERN and others
4668320	4670320	how they actually deal with this problem
4670320	4672320	and they are not very happy that they have just 20%
4672320	4674320	women at CERN
4674320	4676320	and the problem is that they also
4676320	4678320	have just 20% students
4678320	4680320	coming to physics
4680320	4682320	also it's like the problem
4682320	4684320	starts in school
4684320	4686320	and they say
4686320	4688320	they would love to have more
4688320	4690320	female and that's again
4690320	4692320	quite sexist as a statement when you think
4692320	4694320	about that in the backdrop
4694320	4696320	because they say women are
4696320	4698320	tending to care more
4698320	4700320	active and care more
4700320	4702320	about the experiment while males
4702320	4704320	are more interested in their own
4704320	4706320	success
4706320	4708320	so that's also a self description
4708320	4710320	which I found
4710320	4712320	super sexist and that's
4712320	4714320	what I found also very interesting
4714320	4716320	and I think that's the point where you nailed
4716320	4718320	it is so impressive
4718320	4720320	when you go to a place like CERN
4720320	4722320	where people really highly fight
4722320	4724320	to have a diverse
4724320	4726320	reality
4726320	4728320	at the end of the day
4728320	4730320	it becomes again
4730320	4732320	ethnicist, essentializing
4732320	4734320	and sexist and racist
4734320	4736320	and it even comes to the point
4736320	4738320	where Italians are cooking
4738320	4740320	their food and the Russians
4740320	4742320	are sticking together with
4742320	4744320	the Russians and the Bulgarians
4744320	4746320	are having their Bulgarian meeting
4746320	4748320	and so on and so on
4748320	4750320	it's really fascinating how people deal with this
4750320	4752320	in a cosmopolitan space
4752320	4754320	that has actually the goal
4754320	4756320	of a space gender
4756320	4758320	sex class
4758320	4760320	that do not matter
4760320	4762320	and I think that's
4762320	4764320	important because if you have
4764320	4766320	an ideal of relational
4766320	4768320	agency and of a post human
4768320	4770320	diversity
4770320	4772320	then in a way it's a universal
4772320	4774320	goal
4774320	4776320	it's a universal hope
4776320	4778320	and any universalist
4778320	4780320	approach
4780320	4782320	is fragmented
4782320	4784320	and it becomes a plurality
4784320	4786320	when you go to a certain
4786320	4788320	specific place and I think that's something
4788320	4790320	that I also try to make visible
4790320	4792320	and if you are producing these kind
4792320	4794320	of individual certain
4794320	4796320	communities then you actually could solve
4796320	4798320	these problems and I really hope
4798320	4800320	that we come to another solution
4800320	4802320	because we need different community models
4802320	4804320	we need different work models
4804320	4806320	because this kind of neoliberal work system
4806320	4808320	isn't healthy for anybody of us
4808320	4810320	and it will come, it has to come
4810320	4812320	at a certain point to end
4812320	4814320	maybe not in my lifetime but I hope
4814320	4816320	that I will still witness this
4820320	4822320	Thank you. For this, how is your sound now?
4826320	4828320	There is a message
4830320	4832320	Do you want to ask a question now?
4832320	4834320	You can hear me!
4834320	4836320	Oh, fantastic! I don't know what I have done
4836320	4838320	now I think it's already
4838320	4840320	past you
4840320	4842320	so I'm not going to ask
4842320	4844320	any question now, it's already been
4844320	4846320	addressed
4846320	4848320	No, please Hothis, you cannot
4848320	4850320	leave me that way, I feel like I'm sticking with you
4850320	4852320	I was wondering whether you have
4852320	4854320	ways of being of James Brittle
4854320	4856320	No
4856320	4858320	He's telling exactly the same thing you are
4858320	4860320	but
4860320	4862320	from another point of view he's also
4862320	4864320	read Barat
4864320	4866320	which I will receive
4866320	4868320	for Christmas on the tree
4868320	4870320	and
4870320	4872320	actually
4872320	4874320	he's trying to come to the same kind of
4874320	4876320	understanding but not on the academic level
4876320	4878320	but
4878320	4880320	at the post-human level
4880320	4882320	the world
4882320	4884320	with
4884320	4886320	not viewed from humans only
4886320	4888320	but to include everybody
4888320	4890320	everything
4890320	4892320	and to have
4892320	4894320	an idea of
4894320	4896320	how to find solutions to the fact that
4896320	4898320	everything is so binary
4898320	4900320	so that's also what's been
4900320	4902320	the point of this discussion
4902320	4904320	because it's very binary
4904320	4906320	it's male-female but you have
4906320	4908320	nobody is entirely male and entirely
4908320	4910320	female so you already have
4910320	4912320	different
4912320	4914320	ways of being
4914320	4916320	and he wants
4916320	4918320	he was talking about
4918320	4920320	having computers thinking
4920320	4922320	otherwise than binary
4922320	4924320	but he's not very concrete about it
4924320	4926320	so I don't know whether
4926320	4928320	at CERN there because I also
4928320	4930320	understood from his book that
4930320	4932320	also the computers
4932320	4934320	well the computer models they are using
4934320	4936320	at CERN are this carol
4936320	4938320	Monte Carlo
4938320	4940320	theory based so
4940320	4942320	actually they are based on
4942320	4944320	chance
4944320	4946320	and uncertainty so
4946320	4948320	I was wondering if they are thinking
4948320	4950320	about something else as computers
4950320	4952320	which might be more developed
4952320	4954320	than
4954320	4956320	whatever he points out in his book
4956320	4958320	no they don't
4958320	4960320	it works very well
4960320	4962320	and they are working very precisely
4962320	4964320	with their machine learning
4964320	4966320	algorithms and the Monte Carlo simulations
4966320	4968320	it's really astonishing what they are doing there actually
4968320	4970320	it's really amazing
4970320	4972320	what they are producing there
4972320	4974320	yeah but you are looking
4974320	4976320	again we are looking at uncertainty
4976320	4978320	yes they approximate
4978320	4980320	they approximate it
4980320	4982320	and that's where also the playfulness came into being
4982320	4984320	that's why I deal a lot with playing games
4984320	4986320	because they have lots of rules
4986320	4988320	and uncertainty and chance of playing along
4988320	4990320	but they are not looking for another
4990320	4992320	system beyond the binary model
4992320	4994320	they are not working on this
4994320	4996320	it's not their topic
4996320	4998320	would be maybe something they could engage with
4998320	5000320	but they are much more interested currently
5000320	5002320	in medical applications
5002320	5004320	of what they are doing because it's very useful
5004320	5006320	for example fighting cancer and so on
5006320	5008320	so that's something
5008320	5010320	they look into and also
5010320	5012320	saving energy
5012320	5014320	it's something they are really interested in
5014320	5016320	because CERN uses a lot of energy
5016320	5018320	but also has to deal with the energy problem
5018320	5020320	it tries to find solutions
5020320	5022320	so many people are engaging there thinking to solve that problem
5022320	5024320	also fighting fake news
5024320	5026320	it's something that is very important to them
5026320	5028320	and also what is a fun fact
5028320	5030320	is the Claire
5030320	5032320	that I interviewed later on
5032320	5034320	she came out as non-binary
5034320	5036320	I didn't say it in that moment
5036320	5038320	because she has been read as female
5038320	5040320	and she has been talking a lot about this
5040320	5042320	but later on she came out as non-binary
5042320	5044320	so non-binary is more
5044320	5046320	exists at CERN
5046320	5048320	but
5048320	5050320	I was very much fascinated
5050320	5052320	when I entered the STEM field
5052320	5054320	how much all of this
5054320	5056320	matters still
5056320	5058320	even if I wish it wouldn't
5060320	5062320	and also I think that
5062320	5064320	what I try to
5064320	5066320	what is very clear from you
5066320	5068320	is that it really doesn't
5068320	5070320	that's why I talked about Terrence
5070320	5072320	instead of humans
5072320	5074320	it is that there are alliances
5074320	5076320	and I'm really putting aside
5076320	5078320	the humans along with the algorithms
5078320	5080320	with the computer
5080320	5082320	or with a bug and so on
5082320	5084320	and I think that's very interesting
5084320	5086320	also to think along that way
5086320	5088320	and to step out of this
5088320	5090320	and from a physicist's perspective
5090320	5092320	you can start us, right?
5092320	5094320	Well, yes
5096320	5098320	That's clear
5098320	5100320	Thank you, Rockwantum
5100320	5102320	Yeah
5104320	5106320	Anna, thank you for your presentation
5106320	5108320	I just missed a part of the
5108320	5110320	discussion before as my internet
5110320	5112320	went down
5112320	5114320	I also want to say
5114320	5116320	Centro Karsch from Thomas
5116320	5118320	because he had an urgent meeting
5118320	5120320	to make it
5120320	5122320	but I was just thinking that
5122320	5124320	you just mentioned about
5124320	5126320	sort of this both humanist
5126320	5128320	perspective or maybe transhumanist
5128320	5130320	I don't know if you would call it
5130320	5132320	a sort of transhumanist perspective
5132320	5134320	like having also algorithms
5134320	5136320	and
5136320	5138320	hardware as an
5138320	5140320	equal being
5140320	5142320	Well, that's sometimes quite difficult
5142320	5144320	especially when talking about
5144320	5146320	AI or maybe advanced technologies
5146320	5148320	that sometimes these types
5148320	5150320	of human-made
5150320	5152320	artifacts are placed
5152320	5154320	above
5154320	5156320	or more there still
5156320	5158320	seems to be a hierarchy
5158320	5160320	that people are talking within these
5160320	5162320	sectors like
5162320	5164320	within STEM sectors
5164320	5166320	there seems to be a bit of a bias
5166320	5168320	between
5168320	5170320	technology and certain minorities
5172320	5174320	Do you sort of
5174320	5176320	what's your perspective on that?
5176320	5178320	My perspective on that
5178320	5180320	is now I give you a very fun
5180320	5182320	like please take this with a
5182320	5184320	big grain of irony
5184320	5186320	so in the 1970s
5186320	5188320	physics came
5188320	5190320	to a certain end
5190320	5192320	epistemically and technologically
5192320	5194320	and also as you might know
5194320	5196320	lots of
5196320	5198320	physicists were trained
5198320	5200320	and then there were many people who didn't have a job
5200320	5202320	but there was LSD
5202320	5204320	and there were other drugs
5204320	5206320	that allowed them to think further
5206320	5208320	and they really took these drugs and then Apple came
5208320	5210320	into being and many other funny things
5210320	5212320	like for example string theory
5212320	5214320	and I think what you describe right now is
5214320	5216320	a time where we are living in a
5216320	5218320	hyper realistic time
5218320	5220320	where these kind of mind expanding
5220320	5222320	experiences where you understand
5222320	5224320	as when people
5224320	5226320	who have taken LSD they would always describe
5226320	5228320	this kind of we are one world
5228320	5230320	and this postal humanist perspective is something
5230320	5232320	that they are really seeing when they
5232320	5234320	are taking these kind of
5234320	5236320	mushroom derivatives
5236320	5238320	that we are living
5238320	5240320	in a time where we're coming through technology
5240320	5242320	and that's fascinating to the same point
5242320	5244320	because the transhumanist perspective
5244320	5246320	and the post humanist terminology
5246320	5248320	emerged by Andrew Pickering and others
5248320	5250320	who studied in the 1990s physics
5250320	5252320	high energy physics
5252320	5254320	and what you describe in the hierarchy
5254320	5256320	I think is still a narcissist mirroring
5256320	5258320	so they look at the stuff they created
5258320	5260320	and since they want to be
5260320	5262320	big and taller than they are
5262320	5264320	actually they make what they
5264320	5266320	created bigger and taller as it
5266320	5268320	actually is and I think
5268320	5270320	this will all be played
5270320	5272320	unfortunately due to the climate
5272320	5274320	crisis we are experiencing
5274320	5276320	and all the augmenting crisis
5276320	5278320	this will be put into place
5278320	5280320	and I am at this point
5280320	5282320	very how should I say
5282320	5284320	guarded optimistic
5284320	5286320	that although we are undergoing
5286320	5288320	these kind of challenges and undergoing
5288320	5290320	these kind of crazy fights
5290320	5292320	of identity
5292320	5294320	politics that I personally do not like
5294320	5296320	at all and people who
5296320	5298320	would be racist and
5298320	5300320	would be sexist and would be techno
5300320	5302320	optimist and so on say yes
5302320	5304320	we go to the Mars and so on
5304320	5306320	that we are coming back to a
5306320	5308320	perspective where what you're
5308320	5310320	following at the clear
5310320	5312320	is actually the future and that's
5312320	5314320	something that I'm also working on that's why I'm very
5314320	5316320	grateful that you invited me because
5316320	5318320	we are working on the same
5318320	5320320	topic and people around the world
5320320	5322320	are doing what you do what I
5322320	5324320	do and that's something where we have
5324320	5326320	to stick together and sometimes
5326320	5328320	we might have to go into subversion
5328320	5330320	and we have to use it to play
5330320	5332320	like Claire played the dominant
5332320	5334320	ruling society we're living
5334320	5336320	in but I think that at the
5336320	5338320	end of the day we will come to that point
5338320	5340320	and I really hope
5340320	5342320	for that one of when the research
5342320	5344320	that you do will also contribute
5344320	5346320	to that bigger goal
5348320	5350320	Thanks Anne, I hope so
5350320	5352320	I hope so as well
5352320	5354320	it will be this interesting thing
5354320	5356320	to touch on, thank you
5356320	5358320	I also feel like
5358320	5360320	in education or sort of
5360320	5362320	this identity politics
5362320	5364320	that even like through education
5364320	5366320	or people choosing a certain
5368320	5370320	that also in education there should be
5370320	5372320	a lot more trans-disciplinarity and I think also
5372320	5374320	what you talked about during
5374320	5376320	your talk that
5378320	5380320	technical people also
5380320	5382320	need humanities
5382320	5384320	sort of this whole
5384320	5386320	being able to place
5386320	5388320	things in a bigger perspective
5388320	5390320	and perhaps that would, I don't know
5390320	5392320	if it would help like if you have a trans-disciplinarity
5392320	5394320	team of trans-disciplinary
5394320	5396320	people that would also maybe
5396320	5398320	or that they might
5398320	5400320	be more
5400320	5402320	able to place themselves in another person
5402320	5404320	like be able to sort of see
5404320	5406320	or be
5406320	5408320	sort of mindful about having a different
5408320	5410320	perspective or that they are
5410320	5412320	biased in a certain way
5414320	5416320	or is this something that people need to
5416320	5418320	learn or
5418320	5420320	become aware of?
5420320	5422320	Yeah, I totally agree
5422320	5424320	I think that will be the future and it's hard
5424320	5426320	to accept for some
5426320	5428320	but
5428320	5430320	and I'm very happy that for example
5430320	5432320	the Centadio Apostol exists and that you brought it
5432320	5434320	into being Mr. Director, please excuse me
5434320	5436320	that I was
5436320	5438320	challenging your challenge
5438320	5440320	but
5440320	5442320	I really think that we will have
5442320	5444320	these kinds of trends, we need it, we need
5444320	5446320	humanities, we need to survive these days
5446320	5448320	because we are
5448320	5450320	not from an economical
5450320	5452320	neoliberal perspective, we do not seem
5452320	5454320	to be useful but in
5454320	5456320	10 to 20 years many computer scientists
5456320	5458320	will end up without
5458320	5460320	job because AI took their job
5460320	5462320	and then it comes back to interpretation
5462320	5464320	and then comes back to the
5464320	5466320	hermeneutics and then it comes back to the humanities
5466320	5468320	and social science because what
5468320	5470320	AI is producing is
5470320	5472320	boring, mediocre narratives
5472320	5474320	and when it comes out
5474320	5476320	comes to the point where it becomes
5476320	5478320	disturbing, where the human factor
5478320	5480320	plays into, that's something
5480320	5482320	where we come back into it
5482320	5484320	when resoric becomes again
5484320	5486320	important and also hermeneutical understanding
5488320	5490320	We have one question from the room
5490320	5492320	and then 40 seconds, okay?
5496320	5498320	First of all, thank you for
5498320	5500320	this interesting talk
5500320	5502320	Dr. Anne
5502320	5504320	my name is Fabrizio
5504320	5506320	I'm a student
5506320	5508320	and a PhD student here in CLEA
5508320	5510320	and I would like to ask
5510320	5512320	the next question
5512320	5514320	in a
5514320	5516320	disruptive technology where we live
5516320	5518320	right now
5518320	5520320	I think we could
5520320	5522320	use the
5522320	5524320	anthropology in order to
5524320	5526320	empower our workers
5526320	5528320	or workers
5528320	5530320	In your opinion
5532320	5534320	how would you use
5534320	5536320	the best of anthropology
5536320	5538320	in order to improve
5538320	5540320	the resilience
5540320	5542320	of
5542320	5544320	supply chains
5544320	5546320	as you know the supply chain
5546320	5548320	is a
5548320	5550320	group of business
5550320	5552320	excellence that are
5552320	5554320	integrated in a
5554320	5556320	network that works in a
5556320	5558320	like a one system
5558320	5560320	and that will be my question
5560320	5562320	how would you use the
5562320	5564320	best of anthropology
5564320	5566320	in order to improve the resilience
5566320	5568320	of the supply chain
5568320	5570320	thank you
5570320	5572320	Thank you very much again
5572320	5574320	the question is what kind of supply chains should be improved
5574320	5576320	some supply chains
5576320	5578320	I don't want to have improved
5578320	5580320	where I think they are not serving any goals
5580320	5582320	so whenever it comes to
5582320	5584320	the logic of growth
5584320	5586320	we're coming to an end
5586320	5588320	and whenever it comes to exploiting the earth
5588320	5590320	and having this idea that we're taking more
5590320	5592320	and more out it also comes to an end
5592320	5594320	because that's what we do also to ourselves
5594320	5596320	to the world out
5596320	5598320	so I think one thing is really to show
5598320	5600320	that a certain idea of burnout doesn't work anymore
5600320	5602320	burning out the energy
5602320	5604320	of ourselves or taking
5604320	5606320	extracting everything what we could do
5606320	5608320	and that's what we should actually cut
5608320	5610320	or say as anthropologists here as a rupture
5610320	5612320	that's the end it doesn't work anymore
5612320	5614320	we cannot relate anymore to the world
5614320	5616320	and the other would really bring us back
5616320	5618320	bring us back
5618320	5620320	with technologies of embodiment
5620320	5622320	with technologies that we
5622320	5624320	anthropologists when we do field work
5624320	5626320	because when we go into another society
5626320	5628320	and we do
5628320	5630320	transform we are prepared
5630320	5632320	and we have technologies to
5632320	5634320	to be resilient ourselves
5634320	5636320	to not fall or to survive
5636320	5638320	what we call the culture shock
5638320	5640320	and we experience usually culture shocks
5640320	5642320	after two months we have the field diary
5642320	5644320	we have certain forms of supervision and so on
5644320	5646320	and we have all of this also
5646320	5648320	in Europe already developed
5648320	5650320	we have a whole apparatus of care
5650320	5652320	and I think that's where
5652320	5654320	that's where I see a future
5654320	5656320	and that would also not only
5656320	5658320	say in an essential way
5658320	5660320	anthropology shows are people
5660320	5662320	from Belgium are that way
5662320	5664320	and if you're coming from Mexico
5664320	5666320	then you have to deal with the Belgians
5666320	5668320	this way and please Belgians
5668320	5670320	please acknowledge that you do not understand
5670320	5672320	how it feels to lose
5672320	5674320	your environment when you're from a
5674320	5676320	Amazonian society or so something like that
5676320	5678320	I think that's
5678320	5680320	not something where we are there
5680320	5682320	to just mediate or be the
5682320	5684320	testimonies of other cultures
5684320	5686320	but what we could do is just really
5686320	5688320	relate between the different perspectives
5688320	5690320	and help others to see themselves
5690320	5692320	I think that would be one possible solution
5692320	5694320	that's also where art comes into being
5694320	5696320	and in an ever more
5696320	5698320	entangled world
5698320	5700320	where people are coming from
5700320	5702320	all over the world to Europe
5702320	5704320	and Europe itself
5704320	5706320	is turning into deep
5706320	5708320	crisis one really has to ask also
5708320	5710320	what are the laws
5710320	5712320	the ideals
5712320	5714320	and the fights we in Europe have been fighting
5714320	5716320	and that's the good side also
5716320	5718320	that's also something I want to say
5718320	5720320	but this reasonable European man
5720320	5722320	that the Americans criticized
5722320	5724320	in this
5724320	5726320	Fieldburg snippets I presented to you
5726320	5728320	on the other hand CERN
5728320	5730320	is
5730320	5732320	the outcome of the Second World War
5732320	5734320	where physicists
5734320	5736320	from different nations fought
5736320	5738320	against each other
5738320	5740320	but instead of producing a bomb
5740320	5742320	they really want to find knowledge
5742320	5744320	and they want to show how cosmopolitan
5744320	5746320	work
5746320	5748320	is possible
5748320	5750320	how you really can pursue a goal
5750320	5752320	and I showed you the destructive
5752320	5754320	side of this the ruptures the cuts
5754320	5756320	where it doesn't work
5756320	5758320	but that doesn't mean that the ideas
5758320	5760320	and the goals that CERN produces
5760320	5762320	aren't something that I personally as a European think
5762320	5764320	I'm standing for democracy
5764320	5766320	the ideal of equality even
5766320	5768320	if it's not working criticizing
5768320	5770320	a certain non-democratic hierarchy
5770320	5772320	and so on and so on
5772320	5774320	so I think that's something that we also
5774320	5776320	have to do as anthropologists
5776320	5778320	to say okay that's a certain kind of
5778320	5780320	standard we have been working on
5780320	5782320	and even if we decolonize
5782320	5784320	everything we have to rethink
5784320	5786320	what kind of criticism
5786320	5788320	of colonial power relations
5788320	5790320	actually brought humanism into being
5790320	5792320	and where post-humanism
5792320	5794320	is a child of these kind
5794320	5796320	of developments as such
5796320	5798320	I hope that somehow
5798320	5800320	gives you a little bit of
5800320	5802320	an answer to this and I think that would
5802320	5804320	actually put a resilience to the
5804320	5806320	what you call supply chains
5806320	5808320	or the resilience to certain societies
5808320	5810320	that fight for the equality
5810320	5812320	of people and fight and have
5812320	5814320	also attained the equality
5814320	5816320	of for example women and men
5816320	5818320	or the equality
5818320	5820320	of voting no matter what kind
5820320	5822320	and how much money you have
5822320	5824320	or whether you are aristocrat or not
5826320	5828320	What is?
5828320	5830320	Yes, so I want to come back
5830320	5832320	to the question of trans-
5832320	5834320	trans-civil narrative
5834320	5836320	so I am doing a PhD
5836320	5838320	in philosophy on being
5838320	5840320	and becoming but it's
5840320	5842320	very much based on quantum
5842320	5844320	physics so I've been reaching
5844320	5846320	out to Rovalli and Tonnelli
5846320	5848320	at first
5848320	5850320	they
5850320	5852320	answered the questions I ask
5852320	5854320	and then when I asked
5854320	5856320	when they
5856320	5858320	and Rovalli even said
5858320	5860320	I don't know any philosopher being
5860320	5862320	occupied with
5862320	5864320	quantum physics
5864320	5866320	well he doesn't know Barrett
5866320	5868320	I didn't know her then either
5868320	5870320	so I pointed into Whitehead
5870320	5872320	but at one point in time when I say
5872320	5874320	do you want to get involved with my
5874320	5876320	PhD they don't have time
5876320	5878320	so much for trans-discipline
5878320	5880320	yeah
5880320	5882320	Yeah, that's a good
5882320	5884320	point I have been collaborating
5884320	5886320	with physicists in a
5886320	5888320	class of excellence at Hommel University
5888320	5890320	and it was very interesting
5890320	5892320	where you also would experience this hierarchy
5892320	5894320	of STEM versus humanities
5894320	5896320	philosophy and so on
5896320	5898320	and that comes back to what Flo
5898320	5900320	was actually saying and that's where I hope
5900320	5902320	for the future generation
5902320	5904320	and that's interesting I talked
5904320	5906320	to Lisa Randall
5906320	5908320	and she was very much open
5908320	5910320	and she waited for
5910320	5912320	news and wanted to engage
5912320	5914320	by Carlo Rovalli again
5914320	5916320	I somehow
5916320	5918320	have encountered many of
5918320	5920320	these physicists who are not
5920320	5922320	seeing that there is a ton of philosophy
5922320	5924320	engaging with this and what
5924320	5926320	I also tried to say
5926320	5928320	initially in my talk
5928320	5930320	nothing that quantum mechanics
5930320	5932320	has to give epistemologically
5932320	5934320	is new
5934320	5936320	to history nor anthropology
5936320	5938320	it is not
5938320	5940320	it's rather that actually
5940320	5942320	Schrödinger's cat
5942320	5944320	tried to prevent
5944320	5946320	to bring these two worlds together
5946320	5948320	for certain reasons of dominance
5948320	5950320	of physics and then you have the new
5950320	5952320	age movement and so on which is making
5952320	5954320	this thing fall apart and then again
5954320	5956320	people would say oh no we don't go into esoterics
5956320	5958320	but if you go today in science and
5958320	5960320	technology studies or if you go to
5960320	5962320	Hawaiian philosophers
5962320	5964320	and Hawaiian cosmologists as I just
5964320	5966320	have been last month at
5966320	5968320	a big 4S conference
5968320	5970320	you will find
5970320	5972320	the exact same idea
5972320	5974320	that you as a philosophy
5974320	5976320	of healing that is
5976320	5978320	combining the people of Hawaii
5978320	5980320	of people of aboriginal societies
5980320	5982320	in Australia, in New Zealand
5982320	5984320	or people who do quantum mechanics
5984320	5986320	and take this series
5986320	5988320	and transfer it into the world
5988320	5990320	and it's sad that Ovelli insists
5990320	5992320	on his position of power
5992320	5994320	but that relates again to the imperial
5994320	5996320	power position of physics
5996320	5998320	as such that is falling
5998320	6000320	as much
6000320	6002320	as you can see also with
6002320	6004320	the falling
6004320	6006320	part of believing in science as such
6006320	6008320	with the rise of all these
6008320	6010320	kind of destabilizations of fact
6010320	6012320	making through
6012320	6014320	all these people who believe in whatever
6014320	6016320	kind of piracies.
6016320	6018320	I suggest you
6018320	6020320	send me the email address of
6020320	6022320	the Lauren who is interested
6022320	6024320	and then another thing
6024320	6026320	is I do think
6026320	6028320	quantum physics
6028320	6030320	shakes ontology
6032320	6034320	What kind of ontology?
6034320	6036320	The ontology as we see it
6036320	6038320	as the philosophy of being
6038320	6040320	it makes it
6040320	6042320	dynamic instead of static
6042320	6044320	oh yes it does
6044320	6046320	and so
6046320	6048320	I think the ontological
6048320	6050320	implications
6050320	6052320	of quantum physics are more
6052320	6054320	important and if
6054320	6056320	you have an ontological
6056320	6058320	problem
6058320	6060320	you cannot even have an epistemology
6060320	6062320	you don't have anything anymore
6062320	6064320	so you have to go to another kind
6064320	6066320	of thinking about
6066320	6068320	life
6068320	6070320	which is no longer in being
6070320	6072320	but also in becoming
6072320	6074320	Yes
6074320	6076320	for example if you lead
6076320	6078320	Elizabeth Povinelli, geontologies of the
6078320	6080320	otherwise as anthropologists
6080320	6082320	would deal with this also Mackenzie
6082320	6084320	Warke
6084320	6086320	Molecular Red
6086320	6088320	It's a beautiful book
6088320	6090320	I suggest that I
6090320	6092320	ask Marta for your email address
6092320	6094320	and then you
6094320	6096320	send me your references because this is
6096320	6098320	not going to work here. Wonderful
6098320	6100320	Okay no I totally agree with you
6100320	6102320	it does and that's the beauty of it
6102320	6104320	I agree with you
6104320	6106320	Okay Francis
6106320	6108320	Let me
6108320	6110320	take the position which I
6110320	6112320	not used to take of
6112320	6114320	defending the STEM sciences here
6114320	6116320	I'm personally
6116320	6118320	with one foot in STEM one foot
6118320	6120320	in the humanities I'm
6120320	6122320	officially a philosopher
6122320	6124320	connected to the Department of Philosophy
6124320	6126320	my PhD is in physics
6126320	6128320	but it was actually more about the philosophy
6128320	6130320	of quantum mechanics
6130320	6132320	so I know the domain quite well
6132320	6134320	and I want to say that
6134320	6136320	it's not sufficient to say there is some similarity
6136320	6138320	between Hawaiian philosophy
6138320	6140320	or Daoist philosophy
6140320	6142320	and quantum mechanics to say that
6142320	6144320	well they are equal there at the same level
6144320	6146320	Quantum mechanics
6146320	6148320	is a highly technical
6148320	6150320	domain with a lot of deep
6150320	6152320	philosophical problems but the technical
6152320	6154320	domain means that there is quite a lot
6154320	6156320	of very hard mathematics in there
6156320	6158320	you can't do without it
6158320	6160320	it's thanks to these mathematics that we can
6160320	6162320	build all these
6162320	6164320	transistors and lasers
6164320	6166320	and all these incredible
6166320	6168320	technological applications of quantum mechanics
6168320	6170320	this is
6170320	6172320	something there are no shortcuts for that
6172320	6174320	it's not sufficient to say
6174320	6176320	I have heard
6176320	6178320	Hawaiian philosophy they say the same as quantum mechanics
6178320	6180320	maybe at some level
6180320	6182320	they say the same but if you want
6182320	6184320	to study quantum mechanics you have to go to
6184320	6186320	all the work
6186320	6188320	and it is a lot of work
6188320	6190320	I have done part of it I have given it up
6190320	6192320	at a certain moment and moved my career in a different
6192320	6194320	direction
6194320	6196320	Derek Arts who was the former director
6196320	6198320	of Claire is still working in quantum mechanics
6198320	6200320	he's still coming
6200320	6202320	with new ideas and he still
6202320	6204320	has to admit that there are lots of things
6204320	6206320	he doesn't understand so
6206320	6208320	it's not a question of saying yes but these people
6208320	6210320	they just work from
6210320	6212320	a position of authority
6212320	6214320	so they don't listen to people
6214320	6216320	who have new age ideas or who have
6216320	6218320	whatever ideas
6218320	6220320	no these people know that
6220320	6222320	to go into the depth you really
6222320	6224320	need to go
6224320	6226320	to all the hard
6226320	6228320	work all the mathematics
6228320	6230320	and at that level
6230320	6232320	you can't have a conversation just with a philosopher
6232320	6234320	if the philosopher goes
6234320	6236320	to all the hard work and goes to all the mathematics
6236320	6238320	then maybe you can go
6238320	6240320	more deeply into the
6240320	6242320	what quantum mechanics really means
6242320	6244320	because as Feynman said
6244320	6246320	if you believe you understand quantum mechanics
6246320	6248320	you haven't understood it
6248320	6250320	Yes Francis you are opening
6250320	6252320	many doors and I really think that
6252320	6254320	you're just listening half of what I'm
6254320	6256320	saying sometimes because
6256320	6258320	that's exactly what I'm thinking
6258320	6260320	I totally agree
6260320	6262320	and I cannot agree more after spending
6262320	6264320	eight years with physicists
6264320	6266320	studying at the university
6266320	6268320	sitting there
6268320	6270320	taking classes in the history of physics
6270320	6272320	taking classes in physics
6272320	6274320	of different levels
6274320	6276320	and also spending time with quantum mechanics
6276320	6278320	people with computer simulations
6278320	6280320	people and high energy physics people
6280320	6282320	and that's why I'm sometimes also very
6282320	6284320	careful when I see people
6284320	6286320	who are perceiving themselves as Hawaiian
6286320	6288320	cosmologists as indigenous cosmologists
6288320	6290320	saying
6290320	6292320	what people in quantum mechanics
6292320	6294320	say
6294320	6296320	that's actually what we are also saying
6296320	6298320	I wrote an article on ontological opportunism
6298320	6300320	where I
6300320	6302320	describe exactly that kind of communication
6302320	6304320	between a Lakuta Su
6304320	6306320	cosmologist on the one hand
6306320	6308320	and a physicist at CERN
6308320	6310320	where the Lakuta Su
6310320	6312320	would actually see in the exchange particle
6312320	6314320	Iktomi
6314320	6316320	the trickster god
6316320	6318320	and would study
6318320	6320320	from his perspective
6320320	6322320	quantum mechanics
6322320	6324320	physicists try to translate and get into
6324320	6326320	resonance with this
6326320	6328320	and
6328320	6330320	there is no doubt
6330320	6332320	that one thing is mathematics
6332320	6334320	and as you said also Feynman was saying
6334320	6336320	when you think you have understood it
6336320	6338320	you're not understanding quantum mechanics
6338320	6340320	that's one thing
6340320	6342320	and the second thing is that something I asked
6342320	6344320	always theoretical physicists
6344320	6346320	when I interviewed them was
6346320	6348320	has mathematics been
6348320	6350320	invented or found
6350320	6352320	and the most witty answer
6352320	6354320	to this question was by Lisa Randall
6354320	6356320	because she wasn't sure about it
6356320	6358320	whether it's invented or found
6358320	6360320	and she said if we have
6360320	6362320	invented it then we found
6362320	6364320	a very good thing
6364320	6366320	with mathematics
6366320	6368320	so I totally agree with you
6368320	6370320	and I think one has to be aware of this
6370320	6372320	but now we are
6372320	6374320	coming to strategic
6374320	6376320	alliances again
6376320	6378320	and the strategic alliance
6378320	6380320	between the way
6380320	6382320	quantum mechanics allows to understand
6382320	6384320	the world even if you do not get it
6384320	6386320	on the basis of mathematics on the one hand
6386320	6388320	and those indigenous cosmologies
6388320	6390320	are very useful and necessary
6390320	6392320	to save Gaia
6392320	6394320	so it's just a strategic alliance
6394320	6396320	discussing
6396320	6398320	who has here what kind of
6398320	6400320	you know deeper foundation
6400320	6402320	for me not my point
6402320	6404320	I just want to have a strategic alliance to save this planet
6404320	6406320	and to come to a better living together
6406320	6408320	that's all what I want
6408320	6410320	so thank you Francis for pointing this out
6410320	6412320	because that's at most important
6414320	6416320	Zlatka
6420320	6422320	Thank you
6422320	6424320	for your
6424320	6426320	interesting presentation
6426320	6428320	I first would like to
6428320	6430320	second one what
6430320	6432320	Fotis
