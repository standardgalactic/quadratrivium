1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
So Anne, the floor is yours.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,100
We already see your slides.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,100
So put the spotlight on the floor, welcome.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,480
Yeah, thank you very much.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,240
Before I start my talk and dive into,

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,320
I just would like to know

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,080
what your personal academic background is.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,640
So you do not have to talk too much,

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,200
just everybody who's from the STEM field

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,760
should please raise her or his or their arms

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,760
so that I know whether anybody, okay.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,040
So we have one STEM person, two STEM persons,

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,040
three STEM persons, four STEM persons, thank you very much.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,000
And is there anybody of the humanities

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,760
and social science background of philosophy also?

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,880
Okay, wonderful, okay.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,200
So since there are more people who are

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,360
in the STEM background than not,

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,440
I will just briefly give in two sentences,

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,480
I try to let you know what we are actually doing

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,040
as anthropologists because as I once met a very old physicist

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,320
who still has been raised in the tradition of

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,560
Werner Heisenbach and others,

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,840
many people think anthropology is something

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,880
that everybody can do,

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,360
but actually anthropology is involving also

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,200
a huge set of methodology

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,200
and is a year-long training of doing fieldwork amongst people.

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,960
And some people do fieldwork in foreign cultures

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,560
to themselves, other do fieldwork within their home cultures.

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,320
And the third people do a fieldwork in knowledge cultures.

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,560
And I'm an anthropologist of physics and computer science.

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,480
That means that I'm actually living with

34
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,400
and have been living with physicists

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,000
and computer scientists for the past eight years.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,040
And I'm really diving into their world.

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,960
I'm learning their language.

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,360
I'm experiencing what they experience

39
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,240
and experience is also the most central term

40
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,760
of what we're doing as anthropologists.

41
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,560
That means that we already know very much

42
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,480
that what we see is biased by our own observations

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,760
and that of course everything we observed

44
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,080
within the real world can be just described

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,240
as approximation by ourselves.

46
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,400
So when we do fieldwork,

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,080
we have developed over the past 150 years,

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,080
a toolset that allows us to differentiate

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,800
what is our own perceptual bias.

50
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,880
And on the other hand, what we can see in the field

51
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,440
and where we actually invent the field.

52
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,600
And that's very much important

53
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,800
because there's very often, especially from the STEM field,

54
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,480
the question when we're not working with numbers

55
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,040
and we stop working with statistics predominantly,

56
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,600
we have been and do work with statistics.

57
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,440
We call that mixed methods,

58
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,240
but we predominantly work with interviews,

59
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,640
with language, with listening to the people.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,880
With actually experiencing their lives.

61
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,800
And anthropologists, therefore, is a training

62
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,640
and since we are time-bound human deadly beings,

63
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,840
it takes time to become an anthropologist.

64
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,200
So that's what we actually do.

65
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,560
And that allows us to live with the people

66
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,360
and to understand what's their concern.

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,480
And what I'm going to do today with you

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,040
is to tell you out of my research

69
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,480
that I did in the last years

70
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,880
and dive into the question of future.

71
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,600
And I think that's very much of importance,

72
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,840
especially when you work with

73
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,640
within the field of quantum mechanics,

74
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,320
artificial intelligence and so on and so on,

75
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,360
because these fields are really shaping the digital era

76
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,280
and transforming the whole world

77
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,200
and the whole communities we're living in.

78
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,640
And that's something that's rather my turf.

79
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,880
So I'm looking very much forward also

80
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,560
to the discussions that we have and we will have.

81
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,840
In the last years, I have been, for example,

82
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,040
publishing last year, came out a book first in German,

83
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,320
The Translations in Process,

84
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,520
where I did an ethnography of the computer simulation

85
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,040
of the quantum mechanical double slit experiment

86
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,720
in a single event-based computer simulation

87
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,000
at the research center in Jülich

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,040
and compared it with the quantum mechanical double slit

89
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,560
experiments conducted in Vienna today.

90
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,560
And came out with a comparison, actually,

91
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,040
but about the Schrödinger equation on the one hand

92
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,160
and on the other hand, computer simulation.

93
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,240
So different forms of approximating reality

94
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,360
on the one hand based on first principles in mathematics,

95
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,120
on the other hand based on the approximation to truth

96
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,920
by a single event computer simulation.

97
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,920
And these produce different forms of reality

98
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,240
or interpretations of reality,

99
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,760
which doesn't mean that there isn't any truth anymore,

100
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,160
but the problem of course is,

101
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,280
and you're more aware than I am that with simulation,

102
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,600
you can actually show everything that you want to

103
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,360
and then everything that could be considered as reality

104
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,880
can be put into equality with what is actually

105
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,920
the real reality itself.

106
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,480
And that was quite a challenge and also a lot of fun

107
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,960
because quantum mechanics is something that is posing

108
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,960
all these questions and shattering

109
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,100
the understanding of nature more than anything else.

110
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,000
Something that wasn't so bizarre to us as anthropologists

111
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
because for us, the world is itself always either or,

112
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,360
and not neither or, but neither nor

113
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,680
and has these kinds of entanglements.

114
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,600
So what we found out in the last years

115
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,480
resonates very well with what quantum mechanics

116
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,840
and other disciplines found out.

117
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,800
And in the last years also I dealt a lot

118
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,120
with anthropology of play and games,

119
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,760
with the interrelations of facts and fictions

120
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,840
and how cosmologies are made

121
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,180
and what role science has these days

122
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,180
where fictions are shattering the world of fact-making.

123
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,720
In the next 45 minutes, so I will first of all

124
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
bring you onto a journey

125
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,000
and in the field of humanities and social sciences

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,520
where I'm classically trained,

127
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,460
we very often read written texts.

128
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,500
We are text-based and written hermeneutical disciplines.

129
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,900
We love writing and so please lay back

130
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,900
and bear that it was important to me to write down for you

131
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,900
and what I have been saying because it mattered so much

132
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,580
to me what I wanted to tell you

133
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,820
that I tried to put it into my rusty German English

134
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,860
because more I'm not able to do than rusty German English.

135
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,580
And in this journey, I will first tell you

136
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,540
how I actually ended up at CERN,

137
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,620
how I came to this field work that I did

138
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,300
and that I'm going to present you.

139
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,940
And then I will dive into the question of uncertainty

140
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,940
that stem scientists encounter on all levels.

141
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,260
And what we actually as anthropologists can see

142
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,860
and observe how rhythms of mechanical technology

143
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,580
and algorithmic and also human uncertainty

144
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,740
are going into an interplay

145
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,860
which transform each individual

146
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,960
that is doing actually science

147
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,460
within an experimental field

148
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,340
turns it from an individual

149
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,580
into something that I call intravisual

150
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,380
and how I'm coming to that point

151
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,860
and to describe how this collaboration

152
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,500
of different people doing field work

153
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,340
turning from individuals in entanglement with others

154
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,740
to intravisuals to actually produce science

155
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,060
and to make things happen.

156
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,260
That's something I wanna take you onto a journey with

157
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,380
in the next minutes.

158
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,060
So far, any questions from your side?

159
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,940
Wonderful.

160
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,940
So, field work is a form of memoir making.

161
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,620
Reminds us anthropologist Ruth Behr.

162
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,100
From that perspective, it is a cultural fact-making

163
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,480
of a future yet to come.

164
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,580
Maybe that explains why anthropologists

165
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,940
did not focus on future as a cultural fact

166
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,300
until Arjun Apadurai reminded the discipline.

167
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,020
We were blinded by our own deformation professionel

168
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,300
by the obvious movement of our own way of knowledge production

169
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,980
with field notes and recorded interviews

170
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,260
and tempted by collective interests

171
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,580
and individuals need to know where we

172
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,540
or they are coming from.

173
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,180
Because as already in Odysseys,

174
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,020
people want to know where they're living

175
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,540
and where they're coming from.

176
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,580
But since the future is uncertain,

177
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,860
that's something we do not actually investigate so much with

178
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,100
because we are not fortune tellers.

179
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,180
But it becomes more and more important

180
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,700
in a time of computer simulation

181
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,940
where you actually have to foresee and you can

182
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,220
and you have tools to foresee and estimate futures

183
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,340
quite precisely.

184
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,540
And that is where anthropology becomes interesting

185
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,980
when you think about the future

186
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,500
and how the future is made.

187
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,780
A long time ago, anthropology was a space bound

188
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,740
and historiography a time bound discipline.

189
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,940
Anthropology deals with futures and realities

190
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,020
and what is happening in the now.

191
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,340
And historiography is looking into the past.

192
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,580
The first anthropology mistrusted by design

193
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,180
how the past is made through archival sources

194
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,620
because who chooses what is going into the archives?

195
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,740
Who chooses the truth of the past?

196
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,380
Why the latter, historiography,

197
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,660
mistrusted any investigations of the contemporary

198
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,620
as already the philosopher Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel summed it up,

199
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,580
the flight of my nervous old is blind in the now.

200
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,020
We cannot understand the now

201
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,860
because we are part of the present.

202
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,660
And it was this Hegel's challenge encountered

203
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,700
by the ethnographers attempt to understand

204
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,580
what is going on right now that turned me

205
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,220
into an anthropologist from historiography coming.

206
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,700
And it is this challenge that drives me from now on

207
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,860
to the days that are coming.

208
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,660
I always was drawn to understand

209
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,780
what humans make out of this being in

210
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,300
and beyond space, time and matter.

211
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,060
And that is what I will talk about.

212
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,100
In the following minutes, I want to contribute

213
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,580
to the question how different futures are being practiced,

214
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,140
narrated, placed and made tangible in everyday life worlds.

215
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,420
I'm doing so by reflecting upon ethnographic insights.

216
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,540
I gathered over the past eight years

217
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,380
in the falling empire that discursively

218
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,580
and technically reigned what Karen Barat,

219
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,340
a philosopher and physicist called, I quote,

220
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,660
imperialism of universal space and time.

221
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,180
I'm talking about physics

222
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,580
and to be more precise, high energy physics.

223
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,260
Why I consider this a falling empire

224
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,380
and not a reigning empire we can talk about later.

225
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,660
I'm very curious about it.

226
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,820
And I'm also taking up the challenge to discuss this.

227
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,540
I'm telling tales how physicists deal with resistances

228
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,980
of materiality and masculinity.

229
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,220
I'm not aiming to explain to you again

230
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,740
the cosmology and technologies of physics

231
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,060
with the help of feminist science and technology studies

232
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,940
or to retell you how physicists do their job.

233
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,260
I did this elsewhere.

234
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,100
And I think there are enough people in this room

235
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,300
who know much better and more about this than I do.

236
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,380
And others actually did this already,

237
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,140
like Sharon Trawig, Karen Knott-Cetina

238
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,580
or the Belgian philosopher Isabel Stengers.

239
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,420
Rather, I try to give an account

240
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,740
out of one of the centers of the ruined

241
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,780
and ruinous places of Europe,

242
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,020
this de-centered and misplaced territory of Gaia

243
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,900
as Pernullatou and others would call it.

244
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,220
It is an account of how people deal with uncertainty

245
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,100
out of concern and care for what they love most,

246
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,140
which is in this case, an experimental system of physics.

247
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,180
I'm looking for what is a wondrous future to them,

248
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,140
which is to understand what constitutes our cosmos,

249
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,700
I quote, from a physical point of view

250
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,580
and collaborate in a common universal enterprise

251
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,260
that includes everything and excludes exclusivity in the end.

252
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,260
My ethnography is the account of a most cis,

253
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,340
hetero and male white dominant field.

254
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,740
Its origins of organization and community

255
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,620
are dating back to war, to the Second World War,

256
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,060
the atom bomb plus alamos, physics people did learn

257
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,740
to love the bomb when it just existed as a vague plan.

258
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,460
In fact, they made it up.

259
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,460
These people are Stanley Kubrick's blueprints

260
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,420
and they are not.

261
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,020
For where is normativity and power,

262
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,940
there is resistance and subversion also

263
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,220
and foremost amongst physicists.

264
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,780
And even physicists' identities aren't either all

265
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,300
or especially physicists' identities aren't dualist,

266
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,860
but carefully monitored and risk-managed.

267
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,820
Yes, these guys, as even women in the field often call themselves,

268
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,340
are separating nature and culture.

269
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,860
Yes, they seem to be hopeless platonics,

270
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,780
believing and proving mathematics idealism

271
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,500
and helpless Aristotelians observing and measuring nature,

272
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,620
making up categories and models.

273
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,820
They mistrust their data and falsify hypothesis.

274
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,740
They pushed ethics into another department,

275
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,140
but didn't we as anthropologists in Germany too,

276
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,460
when we decided not to be a political discipline

277
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,220
after the Second World War,

278
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,620
and what we are actually doing is transforming again

279
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,460
into a political discipline.

280
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,900
And that's very fascinating,

281
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,140
but from a decolonial perspective,

282
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,340
in times of identity crisis of Europe all over Europe.

283
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,580
You see, I will be talking from a West German

284
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,460
wide middle upper class perspective,

285
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,420
not of my choice, but of discursive attribution.

286
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,460
I like to see from any other point of view,

287
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,420
but I come from these privileged worlds

288
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,380
and thus unlearn every day to look

289
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,700
and loosen up conceptions I grew up with.

290
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,740
Thus, addicts met us to me on many levels

291
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,300
and rethinking the world from this ruined and ruinous place

292
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,460
employed by the university of Jena

293
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,100
that granted Karl Marx his PhD

294
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,440
and allowed Hegel to write his phenomenology of perception,

295
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,800
just pushes me to understand local specificities

296
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,760
and global peculiarities

297
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,680
in ever more solidarity-needing world

298
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,960
that craves for togetherness

299
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,520
and a sense of Guyon community,

300
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,520
but fragments in small communities of indigenities

301
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,160
that lose the big picture on the one hand,

302
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,200
and in the meantime on the other,

303
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,400
Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos battle

304
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,200
for the shuttle service to the moon.

305
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,840
Whatever we learned, no matter what we see,

306
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,240
intraactions, and I'm deploying here the term of Karen Barat

307
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,560
that she developed

308
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,760
out of the Copenhagen interpretation of Nils Bohr,

309
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,640
intraactions of realities,

310
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,800
that means phenomena are emerging out of the interaction

311
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,520
within the moment and aren't pre-disposed.

312
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,920
Interactions of realities

313
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,680
build the fundament of our disciplinary insights.

314
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,600
Experiences are not human-made alone.

315
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,640
And chance, as we all patients,

316
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,280
as well as patients, are our most important assets

317
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,320
for doing a good analysis of our own empirical insight.

318
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,160
That's right.

319
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,560
Yeah?

320
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
They're not based on the truth.

321
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,320
Excuse me.

322
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,800
Should I continue?

323
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Just for the...

324
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,000
Are you still there?

325
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,160
Yes, yes.

326
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,480
Okay.

327
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
So...

328
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,800
All right.

329
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,280
So, I rather prefer not to talk about humans anymore,

330
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,960
and we as an anthropology,

331
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,640
and that's also very interesting, our stop and reflect

332
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,800
of how to call actually our new alliances within the world.

333
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,360
And that makes it even more interesting

334
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,640
because physics is dealing by definition with what is not living,

335
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,000
while biology and so on is dealing with what is alive.

336
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,280
And we are shattering these kind of conceptions

337
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
out of different reasons.

338
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,360
On the one hand, because there are many cosmologies

339
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,920
like Southern American cosmologies

340
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,640
or Antarctic cosmologies and people who live

341
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,200
in these regions who would never distinct

342
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
between living and un-living.

343
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
And on the other hand, because...

344
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
And on the other hand, because...

345
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,520
And made the others after the Gaia development

346
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,480
of James Lovelock and so on,

347
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,880
come to another perception of understanding the Earth

348
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,160
and humans within the Earth when they took the perspective

349
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,080
out of the extraterrestrial perspective on Earth

350
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,520
that emerged with the Kodak picture of 1972

351
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,960
of the Apollo Kodak picture of Earth.

352
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,280
So, I like the word Terence, which is a new term,

353
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,680
a post-humanist term,

354
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,320
deployed by Deborah Danowski, Bruno Latour

355
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,440
and Eduardo Vivero Stikasto

356
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,840
for those aware and grounded beings

357
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,560
and things opposing modern just humans

358
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,200
and their objectifications.

359
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,000
And that allows me to understand anthropology in a new way.

360
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,760
I study Anthropos and its ethnoi,

361
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,760
so their people and communities on all scales,

362
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,160
but I stopped to think this kind of kinship

363
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,680
that we traditionally had just amongst humans.

364
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,800
There are new modes of kin, kin with Earth,

365
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,360
kin with trees, other forms of relations,

366
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,160
and that makes it all interesting.

367
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,000
And from an alien point of view,

368
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,840
we are all Earthlings or Terence.

369
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,520
And it seems to me that this message

370
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,960
is the most important one one can share out of my field

371
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,120
of studying the so-called reasonable physicists

372
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,800
because physicists actually have quite a similar perception

373
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,520
on these things.

374
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,560
And they are, on the other hand,

375
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,600
gatekeepers of modern humanism,

376
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,000
inventors of the worldwide web protocol

377
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,120
and main forces in the development of computer simulations.

378
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,080
To dare to think from a futurist's perspective,

379
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,840
to turn science fiction into contemporary every day

380
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,520
was for me one of the most fascinating aspects

381
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,760
I observed at CERN.

382
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,840
CERN is a collaborative digital enterprise.

383
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,760
Each individual is connected to various media

384
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,000
and is transforming into something else,

385
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,320
not only into a digital divideral,

386
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,880
that's a concept that emerged by Marilyn's CERN

387
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,240
to understand Papua New Guinea societies,

388
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,720
which do not have people there,

389
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,360
do not have an individualist concept

390
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,960
as we do have here in Europe.

391
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,800
But actually it seems to me into something

392
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,360
what I want to call with the help of quantum mechanical

393
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,040
natural philosophy, intra-vigral.

394
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,080
So I'm connecting the intra and the inner of the individual

395
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,320
on the one hand with the collectivity.

396
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,920
And it turns that in these kind of scientific collaborations

397
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,920
that are based on digital tools,

398
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,920
the solitary of the single researcher

399
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,960
becomes a solitary being

400
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,480
with all its productive and destructive forces and dynamics.

401
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,240
And what is really fascinating is that physicists

402
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,080
are all the time not only trying to deal

403
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,760
and resonate with science fiction as a fixtures metaphor,

404
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,480
but really try to think the future

405
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,520
and have to think the future

406
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,800
because their experiments are happening in the future.

407
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,840
I will come to this in the following.

408
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,200
In order to make this point,

409
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,720
I get down to Earth with you

410
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,560
into the everyday of fictions of science

411
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,800
or how bugs, Martin and screw and others

412
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,240
are intervening everyday physics

413
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,320
and how the biggest resistance is coming from materiality

414
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,040
and also interestingly enough,

415
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,280
a certain type of masculinity

416
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,240
and discursive practice and rights.

417
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,520
Physics can still teach us something about the future,

418
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,760
especially how to deal with that, what we do not know,

419
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,320
and yet how to deal with expectations and power relations.

420
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,640
But first, I want to tell you how I ended up at CERN

421
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,320
and what brought me into the situation

422
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,520
where I'm in right now.

423
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,560
In my first field, I was doing research in Vienna.

424
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,760
I was discussing with local artists and writers in Austria

425
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,240
about the relation of words and worlds

426
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,160
and what to make of it

427
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,120
when it comes to cultural identity politics.

428
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,640
From a German speaking case, that's very fascinating

429
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,400
because some of you might know that Hitler was Austrian,

430
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:26,400
but he became the leader of the German Empire.

431
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
And after the Second World War,

432
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,480
the Austrians had to become actually an own nation state

433
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,720
and they are a good example of successful nation building.

434
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,200
So the successful creation of a collective identity

435
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,960
and writers played in a very important role

436
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,600
when it came up to deal with the atrocities committed

437
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,120
in the name of the German people

438
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,800
that Austrians tried to push away from themselves

439
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,360
but had to made aware, of course,

440
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,680
because anti-Semitism and everything that went along

441
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,000
with the atrocities committed

442
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,600
and the crimes committed in the name of the German people

443
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,080
were also committed in and by Austrians and from Austrians, too.

444
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,280
And that fascinated me a lot.

445
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,080
And I came into this field and did this research

446
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,880
and one wonders how do I end up at CERN

447
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,040
and there are many, many different reasons why.

448
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,800
But one of them was actually an epistemic problem.

449
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,600
And the epistemic problem was the question

450
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,240
how to deal and understand what I said in the beginning,

451
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,560
how to understand in real time in the now something

452
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,280
that is happening while I'm part of what is part of the system.

453
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,160
And it was the hottest summer in Vienna,

454
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,920
a steel melting heat near the New River.

455
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,720
And one afternoon, the sky was filled with baroque clouds

456
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,760
and rain was about to come.

457
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,320
And the wind blew through the streets.

458
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,440
I watched it from my window and it all sounds very poetic.

459
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,920
But also I started to think.

460
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,440
A tree just beneath the house waved its crown

461
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,400
and I started to watch the leaves.

462
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,040
And from the whole of the leaves,

463
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,640
I tried to follow the movement of each one of the leaves,

464
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,880
tried to perceive all different movements of each leaf

465
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,160
of this one tree waving in the wind back and forth

466
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,440
at the same time.

467
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,120
I don't know whether the thought that we as humans

468
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,720
are like these leaves on the Gaia tree

469
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,920
or whether the thousand movements of the tree

470
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,560
in the wind came first.

471
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,480
But I understood in that moment why any observer,

472
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,120
even the most unentangled sitting on a window

473
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,120
and staring into the streets or onto this tree,

474
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,920
is not able to capture historical time

475
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,280
and its complexity.

476
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,400
For this tree is moved by the wind,

477
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,960
but the thermodynamics are transforming each micro area

478
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,680
into another zone and each leaf is a leaf on its own

479
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,760
and left alone while at the same time connected to the tree.

480
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,480
You see where I'm going

481
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
and maybe understand this allegory.

482
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,720
Why I thought that I had to head into the world of physics

483
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,040
to give the spatial concept of ethnographic fields

484
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,640
and observer another temporal dimension.

485
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,600
Since then, I wonder why Bronislav Malinovsky,

486
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,120
one of the founding figures of anthropology

487
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,640
who studied physics first in Kraków,

488
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,400
did not follow quantum mechanics

489
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,520
and did not include into his concepts of ethnography

490
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,920
at that time the experimental insights

491
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,280
that actually shattered the world of the 1920s

492
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,800
and 1930s in physics.

493
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,800
It was the tree in front

494
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,680
of my first Viennese field department,

495
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,080
Albert Gassevillon 20, Sieb der Bezirk,

496
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,400
that led me to a fatal book choice

497
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,280
in my favorite book shop of that time, Buchhandlung Posch.

498
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,920
I was sitting on a wooden chair

499
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,720
where many famous Austrian writers said before

500
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,760
as the owner of the shop reminded me

501
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,720
as part of his peculiar Viennese sales psychology,

502
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,120
which always mixes a sense of clients' unwelcoming,

503
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,280
owners' entitlement and traditionality

504
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,720
disguised in ancienité

505
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,960
to give things a value beyond its market price.

506
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,640
I saw Lisa Randall's book, Theoretical Physicist,

507
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,480
Warp Passages, unraveling the mysteries

508
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,080
of the university's hidden dimensions.

509
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,800
And back then I didn't know that I one day

510
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,000
would become friends with Lisa Randall and climb with her,

511
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,480
but I was really surprised

512
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,240
because the way nature was made

513
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,200
in her pop scientific account

514
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,280
and how culture and cultural ideas were deployed

515
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,200
in a, to me, very uncareful way really just puzzled me.

516
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,280
And from that moment I knew I had to get

517
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,640
to know physicists better because they shape the world

518
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,880
and they have a very strong cosmology

519
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,520
and they use cultural ideas in a way

520
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,200
that really are surprising for me as a cultural scientist.

521
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,160
And it was clear to me where I had to go after

522
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,560
and to learn more about the culture

523
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,920
after I was studying poets.

524
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,560
It was the wind and the tree

525
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,760
that led me into the world of physics.

526
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,600
And then I went to CERN.

527
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,200
At CERN though, I encountered different ways

528
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,840
of dealing with space and time.

529
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,160
And actually what time as such could be

530
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,360
and was did not bother anybody near Lake Geneva.

531
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,800
As Isabelle Stengers put it, I quote her,

532
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,920
clearly a certain type of prophetic physics exists today,

533
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,440
but if we must speak of physics,

534
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,800
wouldn't it be preferable to approach it

535
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,360
from the viewpoint of the new undertaking

536
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,960
known as big science?

537
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,640
International financing,

538
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,280
the construction of large scale instruments,

539
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,800
management of an experiment

540
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,160
over a period of several years,

541
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,960
the organization of large numbers of colleagues,

542
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,440
the division of labor,

543
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,800
these are the kind of practical questions

544
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,800
that preoccupied cutting edge physicists today

545
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,040
far more than the ideal questions of physicists vocation.

546
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,440
And so today, I want to share with you

547
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,960
what we can learn from contemporary physics

548
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,520
when it comes to deal with the futures

549
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,800
in our anthropology as well.

550
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,960
And this encompasses foremost a way

551
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,560
of dealing with uncertainties of all kinds,

552
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,040
focusing on hardware, software

553
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,840
and dealing with a certain type of practiced masculinity.

554
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,840
It means of transformation of individualist perspective

555
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,680
into an intra-visualist vision.

556
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,280
I owe these insights to my field

557
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,640
and especially to the women in physics.

558
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,280
Some of them became friends of mine,

559
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,640
male and female, and I'm very glad about that.

560
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,480
Before I entered, people were warning me

561
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,000
that I quote should not ask the gender question,

562
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
end of quotation, that it is the quote death question

563
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,520
end of quotation.

564
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,760
And I never had to ask it.

565
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,920
It was always answered without asking me for it.

566
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,200
Since it's such an important and dominant topic,

567
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,480
people just started to talk about themselves

568
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,560
without that I even put it up.

569
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,680
But before I'm diving into the gender question,

570
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,680
I want to show you some of those levels of uncertainty

571
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,080
that exists at CERN

572
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,360
and why actually thinking the future

573
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,840
and rules are so important at this research site.

574
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,240
The pictures that you see are either taken by myself

575
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,160
or you find them on the website of the CERN collaboration.

576
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,200
Multiple agents weave the fabric of uncertainty

577
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,040
in a data-driven workspace,

578
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,000
at the same time orchestrating the ubiquitous phantasma

579
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,320
of certainty in an ever more unstable

580
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,320
economical, political, global reality.

581
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,600
In this talk, I will look at the current condition

582
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,880
going beyond the entanglement of hardware,

583
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,120
software, algorithm and infrastructure

584
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,840
as it has been done already.

585
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,640
What interests me is how humans interact with one another

586
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,120
when interacting with machines

587
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,040
in liberal structures of patriarchy,

588
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,760
so fundamental in the shaping of the data-driven world.

589
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,160
I put a particular emphasis on the rhythms of doing things

590
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,640
by investigating the importance of cuts and ruptures,

591
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,480
disturbing and destabilizing seemingly stable infrastructures.

592
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,040
Because when actually the infrastructure falls apart,

593
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,360
some hidden structures become visible

594
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,040
and that is something that fascinates me

595
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,520
when I talked about the subversion, for example, initially.

596
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,760
I will briefly mention uncertainties of hardware

597
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,000
and materialities as well as software

598
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,640
to come to the main point of this talk

599
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,120
dealing with reasonable humans and power.

600
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,000
One of the most political ones in times

601
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,320
of so-called gender wars

602
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,600
and heated discussions about identity politics

603
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,280
versus cultural dominations,

604
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,040
where the realms of universality and exclusivity

605
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,200
are renegotiated.

606
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,560
I will end my talk with the introduction of another neologism,

607
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,880
the individual that I already introduced to you

608
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,600
and reflect upon anthropologists

609
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,040
as trailblazing pathfinders of futures beyond the standard now,

610
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,600
because that is what actually makes us so special

611
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,520
amongst the humanities and social sciences.

612
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,320
We're really able to take a little piece of the future

613
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,680
and just talk about it and drag it into what's actually going on

614
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,560
because we are listening carefully to the people.

615
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,480
I'm interested today, especially in the questions of human relations

616
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,160
to one another within such apparatuses

617
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,080
regarding gender and race politics as dominant aspect

618
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,000
of what is about to come.

619
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,680
How does the servant manipulate the master to frame it he-like?

620
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,000
In turning from an individual to something I call intravigil,

621
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,440
a concerned being that foresees the future

622
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,640
and plots in companionship with an agent multiplicity.

623
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,280
This is where subaltern studies

624
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,760
in complex flat hierarchies lead,

625
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,280
for certain prides itself to have flat hierarchies,

626
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,880
but in fact, no hierarchy is flat when white males

627
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,720
and their tools are on the run to assert risk management.

628
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,520
And why does this matter again?

629
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,360
Why do I put up this whole question?

630
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,560
Because high energy physics relies on big data interpreted

631
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,680
and calculated using methods like those implemented

632
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,160
in assessing stock market value.

633
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,360
The constant flow of knowledge and human resources

634
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,560
from the scientific institution to the financial sector

635
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,560
is one of the arguments legitimizing the existence of CERN.

636
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,680
And the big bank companies of Geneva, of course,

637
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,280
are profiting from the flow of PhD grad students

638
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,760
that are flowing from CERN directly into the banking system

639
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
or to Google and so on and so on.

640
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,680
The human factor is the most crucial element

641
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,200
to understand uncertainty in a data-driven world.

642
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,160
The future of our economic system

643
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,160
is bound to research and sciences of many sorts.

644
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,840
It does not only matter with whom we are thinking thoughts,

645
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,360
but how we learn to responsibly use media and tools.

646
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,160
When it comes to what will happen,

647
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,000
uncertainty is the eternal constant of humanity's concern.

648
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,040
Uncertainty is encountered on all levels of experimental research,

649
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,960
from planning over construction and coding to measuring nature.

650
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,480
A few questions remain.

651
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,280
What and how do people learn to interact socially

652
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,000
when dealing with data and computing environments?

653
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,600
And what kind of uncertainties are they exposed to

654
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,560
in data-driven spaces?

655
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,880
The hardware is always uncertain.

656
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,120
Those who follow the developments of grand scientific experiments

657
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,800
might remember that the start of the Large Hadron Collider in 2008,

658
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,600
the world's biggest physics experiment

659
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,120
had been delayed by one year because of a loose screw.

660
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,680
And here you see the picture of the explosion

661
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,040
that was just happening

662
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,200
because one screw wasn't tightened well enough.

663
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,440
A tiny physical object caused a gargantuan obstacle to the machine,

664
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,360
whose maintenance costs exceed one billion euros per year,

665
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,760
and each citizen of the European Union, by the way,

666
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:44,320
pays five euros per year to CERN when you take your tax money.

667
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,400
Meanwhile, all the algorithms, when this happens, did still.

668
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,640
And a tiny, seemingly unimportant object shattered magnets

669
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,880
and within the dreams of the first data harvest of the Higgs boson.

670
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,240
For those of you who are not champs in Big Bang Theory at school,

671
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,200
the Higgs boson is a particle within the standard model

672
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,680
which gives mass to other particles

673
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,680
and helps to explain why our universe is not just made out of light and energy.

674
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,120
The Higgs, of course, is much smaller than the screw,

675
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,600
and unlike the screw, it is invisible to the human eye.

676
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,200
Paradoxically, the screw was neither seen nor foreseen

677
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
and that it would break,

678
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,120
delaying the experiment by one year,

679
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,600
while the Higgs, on the other hand, was foreseen,

680
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,520
simulated and calculated long before the digital experimental system.

681
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,480
Actually, the whole Large Hadron Collider is a big bet

682
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:44,560
that was made up in the 1960s when Peter Higgs came up with this theory.

683
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,280
With the help of pseudo-random Monte Carlo simulations

684
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:53,000
and incorporating and unthinking and ontologically consolidating random

685
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,840
to put it bluntly, physics is actually creating

686
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,280
futurist imaginaries through its theories

687
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:06,440
and physicists are serving as modern future tellers, fortune tellers.

688
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,000
Like historians, physicists interpret temporal traces,

689
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,880
but this is called a histogram, as most of you know.

690
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,720
So, histogram, it is a grammatics of the history of the Higgs particle

691
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,160
that you can see here and the events actually that were piling up

692
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,240
to show the existence of the Higgs particle.

693
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,280
That's something that physicists work with, not with the beautiful images

694
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,680
we know from the Higgs boson, maybe.

695
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,800
So, like historians, physicists interpret temporal traces,

696
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,000
but unlike historians, they simulate the events beforehand

697
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,040
and check afterwards what might have happened,

698
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,160
to say it with Leopold Ranke.

699
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,320
High energy physics is a security-driven world investigating nature,

700
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,960
which on the one hand is determined by laws

701
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,240
and on the other characterized by random behaviors, the uncertainty.

702
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,440
The drive to make data on measurements as certain as possible

703
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,160
exerts an influence on how information is perceived.

704
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,120
This road to scientific certainty, however,

705
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,520
is paved with present uncertainties of all kinds.

706
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,840
I have written about incidents like the one of the screw elsewhere

707
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,840
and if you're interested, I'm happy to send you a copy of this article,

708
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,080
which deals not only with the screw screwed, the start of the Higgs,

709
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,040
but also how a martin, a bird, bugs,

710
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,120
and finally the physical resistance of materiality itself

711
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,080
are constant factors to deal with

712
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,960
when planning and dealing with an experiment that will run for decades.

713
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,360
I came to the conclusion that physicists are unconsciously acting out

714
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,480
like the most prolific historiographic theorists of,

715
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,560
like, for example, Reinhard Kozellik,

716
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,520
envisioning human beings in historicity on the one hand,

717
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,920
hermeneutically tracing patterns of the past by simulating it beforehand,

718
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,960
and on the other by constantly pushing the space of experience

719
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,720
into horizons of expectation.

720
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,600
Physicists love to think of the future.

721
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,680
I sometimes wonder whether ever and if,

722
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,320
but in addition of anthropology today in 2123,

723
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,720
of, for example, anthropology would look like,

724
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,880
but physics today exists and that is really fascinating.

725
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,160
Physicists are giving up or writing journals

726
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,480
and wonder how physics in 100 years' look would look like.

727
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,200
Anthropologists, I couldn't imagine any of our discipline

728
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,560
being that bold to actually envision anthropology in 100 years.

729
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,680
The second degree of uncertainty after the materiality

730
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,360
that I just presented to you with a screw may be found in software.

731
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,960
Not only lose screws pose danger to the stability

732
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,960
of experimental infrastructure, but also bugs,

733
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,840
those of the digital kind needless to say.

734
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,560
The software used at CERN needs to be programmed,

735
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,520
but more importantly, constantly maintained.

736
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,000
This daily care defines the work rhythms of high-energy physicists

737
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,760
to spend most of their time hunting down bugs

738
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,320
and keeping digital storage in order.

739
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,760
Individual human visions need to be aligned to reach a common goal.

740
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,200
The gathered data on particles stored on farms all over the world

741
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,520
is analyzed by collaborations with the help of a network called GRID,

742
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,360
which spans the globe.

743
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,640
It guarantees that heaps of data can be processed.

744
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,360
Since machine learning algorithms help to analyze

745
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,800
the pattern recognition of physical events,

746
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,720
feeding the nodes with the right input is crucial to the frame

747
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,680
to the most surveilled uncertainty

748
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,600
within current informatics apparatuses.

749
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,000
The X4 factor brought out into the game

750
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,680
through artificial intelligences of utmost importance

751
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,800
and interest is something I think some of you are dealing with

752
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,560
in person also in your work.

753
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,680
Each human task is registered by the so-called ticket on GitHub,

754
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,080
a software development and management platform.

755
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,320
The memory of the task will be gone as soon as the ticket on GitHub

756
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,320
is solved and resolved.

757
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,040
If the code is working, computers do not need to keep the memory

758
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,480
of human actions, do not need to have a trace of historicity

759
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,280
how a failure came into being and was resolved.

760
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,160
In that sense, bugs produce a certain form of casualty,

761
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,320
which happens from case to case, casualité, not causality,

762
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,560
from case to case, from one solve ticket to the other.

763
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,200
Once the chain of problem is solved,

764
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,720
however, there are no casual traces left

765
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,800
and so the origins of the bug are forgotten.

766
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,080
To keep the otherwise lost socio-technical memory,

767
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,320
physicists keep personal lab books,

768
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,000
make nodes not unlike anthropologists keep field diaries.

769
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,320
Scheming capital M guy.

770
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,320
While some people are great in solving bug problems,

771
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,320
others seem to be much better in coding bugs into the system,

772
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,320
often without being held accountable for their mistakes

773
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,320
or causing a pile of additional work

774
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,320
by misinterpreting the work schedule.

775
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,320
The first ones are usually devoted graduate students

776
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,320
who solve the problems and the latter ones,

777
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,320
often long time ago grads, older, politically experienced,

778
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,320
predominantly white male members of the collaboration.

779
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
Even in the cosmopolitan experimental group

780
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,320
such as the Large Hadron Collider of CERN,

781
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
where hierarchies are allegedly flat,

782
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,320
age, gender, experience and national allegiance matter

783
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,320
and people reflect upon this all the time, as I will show now.

784
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,320
In hierarchical environments of highly specialized

785
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
and distributed work spheres,

786
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
where complex problems need to be solved

787
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,320
in short bursts of time and goals reached,

788
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,320
human often need to plot, not only scientific diagrams,

789
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,320
but also intrigues of all kinds, politics,

790
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,320
as you all know who work at the university, matter most.

791
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,320
This often happens because leading positions are occupied

792
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:58,320
by older physicists, elderlies, who are politically experienced,

793
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,320
but not anymore up to date with the most recent applied work,

794
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,320
like programming itself.

795
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,320
Anat Singh anthropologist refers to the representatives

796
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,320
of these groups as the so-called capital man guy,

797
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,320
capital M, big M guy.

798
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,320
At CERN, the capital M guys are predominantly,

799
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,320
I quote another Harvard professor of particle physics,

800
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,320
a female, reasonable European man,

801
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,320
adding that she could not breathe at CERN

802
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,320
because of their omnipresence.

803
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,320
The data-driven world is full of capital M guys.

804
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
To deal with the amount of uncertainty,

805
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,320
they create an armament of strategic tools

806
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,320
that need to be brought in to manipulate

807
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,320
those experienced power-driven manipulators.

808
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,320
It would have even impressed military strategists

809
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,320
such as Sun Tzu or Karl von Klausowitz.

810
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,320
The trick is to play the game with closed cards,

811
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
but along the rules at the same time,

812
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,320
weaving alliances behind their back

813
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
and winning the right authorities figures over.

814
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,320
So I'm going to show you now how actually

815
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,320
what kind of subversive strategies people,

816
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
PhD students, grad students, deploy

817
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,320
to come and reach their goals,

818
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,320
although they are not in the power positions.

819
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,320
The PhD students at CERN learn to play those double games

820
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,320
along with the mastery of code at the same time.

821
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,320
The social skills then they are wandering into,

822
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
and these social skills,

823
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,320
and that's fascinating,

824
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
are wandering into the financially

825
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,320
and into the financial and into the technical sectors.

826
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,320
So they take what they learn at CERN

827
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
and bring this kind of work culture

828
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
into the other work cultures,

829
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,320
which are not anymore in science and at the university.

830
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,320
I assume each workspace

831
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,320
generates its own terroir of scheming,

832
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
but CERN can be, I quote,

833
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
a true vipers nest,

834
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,320
as physicists with years of experience

835
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,320
once said to me,

836
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,320
or a cog association,

837
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,320
as a female grad student said to another

838
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
when listening to her latest sister's

839
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,320
truce meeting experience.

840
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,320
I quote,

841
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Interestingly, when I'm talking to male grad students,

842
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
they all seem not to experience such incidents,

843
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,320
but all females have had the same experience.

844
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
How can you measure something

845
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
that can't be nailed through worlds?

846
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
Asks Mia Ferrari,

847
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,320
one of my closest interlocutors

848
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,320
who turned into a friend of mine later.

849
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,320
In supremacist environments,

850
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,320
cunningness is the most important virtue.

851
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,320
Documenting is documenting is key,

852
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,320
and social engineering is an everyday common

853
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,320
that starts even before the moments when the gates

854
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,320
to the research sites are crossed.

855
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,320
The case of Claire.

856
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,320
I had the chance to record a small episode

857
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
demonstrating this daily phenomenon

858
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
with the help of Claire Covet,

859
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,320
a grad student from North America.

860
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,320
I promised her to be as vague as possible

861
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
about the technicalities of her workgroup

862
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
since the specific community is small,

863
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,320
and Covet was, I quote,

864
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,320
on the market this fall and graduating next year

865
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,320
when I conducted the interview.

866
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,320
Claire is working on the upgrade

867
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,320
of one of the LHC detectors when I met her

868
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,320
and had to guarantee its efficiency

869
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,320
for the third season in the game of bosons,

870
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,320
as some Cerenes love to call it,

871
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,320
when energy and luminosity is about to be increased

872
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
during the next run of the LHC,

873
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,320
which started last year in 2022.

874
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,320
In her work, Claire discovered

875
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,320
that some calculations had not been made correctly

876
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,320
under the guidance of the team leader of her group.

877
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,320
He is known for losing his temper

878
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,320
and not able to admit a mistake.

879
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
As a result, she needs to prove

880
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
the correctness of her calculations

881
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,320
and falsify the statements of her peer.

882
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,320
But she's not the one that makes the meeting schedules.

883
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
Her main goal was therefore to make space

884
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,320
for her cause during the precious online meetings

885
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,320
because she wanted that the system is running,

886
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,320
that the experimental system will work at the end.

887
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,320
To discuss her case,

888
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
I met Covet in the upper section

889
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,320
of her community building at CERN,

890
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,320
in an area that is quite enough

891
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,320
for recording and interview

892
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,320
and remote enough for not being overheard by anyone.

893
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,320
She chose the spot,

894
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,320
and whenever someone who looked familiar to her

895
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,320
seemed to come closer, she would tone down.

896
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,320
I quote.

897
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,320
Usually, oh, that's the wrong.

898
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,320
Usually you can do it privately.

899
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,320
Usually you do not need to do this.

900
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,320
This particular guy is known for being difficult.

901
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,320
Even now, his strategy in the meeting

902
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,320
was to essentially force the issue offline,

903
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,320
which we knew would happen.

904
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,320
I already talked to the coordinators

905
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,320
to get the relevant data to the team in the US

906
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,320
so that they could do the calculations

907
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,320
and send them back as quickly as possible

908
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,320
to this other guy.

909
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,320
Solving problems informally and offline

910
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,320
means that there are no official records

911
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,320
of how and if things are done.

912
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,320
The off record space is a dangerous

913
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,320
and difficult territory for those

914
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,320
who are not having a say.

915
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,320
Without heavy weights in the collaboration,

916
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,320
nothing can be moved.

917
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,320
But it's certainly not less dangerous

918
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,320
as any other on the record turf.

919
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,320
Claire argues that her boss is someone

920
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,320
who needs to be addressed indirectly

921
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,320
in a way that she describes as, I quote,

922
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,320
backstage work.

923
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,320
I knew I had to call out this guy and his team.

924
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,320
I had opinions on him from the various people

925
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,320
I know from heart rate so they could say

926
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,320
what kind of play we had to make.

927
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,320
I made sure when to send the slides out

928
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,320
and I did not invite him to the meeting

929
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,320
but the authorities figures did.

930
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,320
The activity coordinators made sure

931
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,320
that he would come to the meeting.

932
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,320
Claire describes precisely how she had

933
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,320
to weave alliances, winning authority figures.

934
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,320
The whole plotting took time in consideration

935
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,320
that she might have used more effectively

936
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,320
for technical problems.

937
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
I quote, I spread it about a period

938
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
over two weeks and it took me

939
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,320
maybe five hours of work

940
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
but it is built on something.

941
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,320
We have been talking about the coordinate system

942
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,320
problem actually a year.

943
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
I went back into the stack of my notebooks.

944
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,320
I flipped back to find the relative facts

945
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,320
and I started tracking this problem

946
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,320
explicitly in detail on February 14th,

947
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,320
2017, presented it

948
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,320
on February 14th, 2018.

949
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,320
So one year today I made

950
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,320
my first measurements of the problem

951
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,320
in December 2016 and we had

952
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,320
been talking about it since February 2017.

953
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,320
So that's the period of time

954
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,320
it actually takes

955
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,320
to win over

956
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,320
when you're coming from the other side.

957
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,320
In a language that

958
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,320
oscillates between theater,

959
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,320
American football

960
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,320
and computer game vernacular,

961
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,320
Claire describes her social engineering

962
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,320
in order to solve a technical problem.

963
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,320
She ends the episode by emphasizing

964
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,320
that the whole issue has been caused

965
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,320
because everyone has so many things to do

966
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,320
explaining not without pride

967
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,320
how she attracted long-term attention

968
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,320
becoming a respectable member of

969
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,320
the team despite being a woman.

970
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,320
It is less an issue of breakdown

971
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,320
and communication and more an issue

972
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,320
of priority. People

973
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,320
have so many things to do all the time

974
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,320
that unless you put something on top of their priority list

975
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,320
things will not work. I caused a scene.

976
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,320
Now it's in the meeting notes.

977
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,320
It has memories.

978
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,320
They will not forget a young female graduate

979
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,320
student calling out a senior member

980
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,320
of the community. That's ballsy.

981
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,320
So in doing that I reminded

982
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,320
people what happened and I gave

983
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,320
the touchdowns.

984
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,320
It got to people's memories

985
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,320
and next time we will have the meeting.

986
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,320
They will ask what has been done

987
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,320
with this.

988
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,320
That's her workplace.

989
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,320
The place of Claire Kovetz

990
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,320
chose for telling me the story.

991
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,320
The constant control that exercised

992
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,320
to check whether we were potentially spotted

993
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,320
in the moment. Later on her cleaner

994
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,320
to be too precise about her work

995
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,320
environment shows in the first place

996
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,320
the uncertainty young graduate students are living in

997
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,320
when working for a wide reasonable European

998
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,320
man and the pressure of high-end

999
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,320
institutions such as CERN.

1000
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,320
It exemplifies the unpredictably

1001
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,320
and vanity of leading authority

1002
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,320
figures and how the second and also

1003
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,320
the thirst and the drive

1004
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,320
for power and also

1005
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,320
how the second and third

1006
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,320
row of workers stabilize the system

1007
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,320
preventing ruptures and

1008
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,320
failures caused by the self

1009
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,320
and tight uncertainty of the capital M guy.

1010
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,320
Uncertainty

1011
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,320
is augmented by potential infrastructural

1012
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,320
ruptures caused by human failed

1013
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,320
attempt to overcome technical, physical

1014
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,320
or social obstacles.

1015
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,320
Synchronization, prioritization

1016
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,320
and the right rhythm

1017
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,320
to cut and resume communication

1018
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,320
in order to install a memory

1019
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,320
of an action seem to be

1020
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,320
essential in securing position and

1021
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,320
balancing the common goal of the collaboration

1022
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,320
and that has nothing

1023
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,320
interestingly enough to do with the kind of

1024
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,320
rhythms and memories of the computer.

1025
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,320
Preventing ruptures

1026
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,320
means circumventing and uncertainties

1027
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,320
means to exchange individuality

1028
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,320
against what I call intraviguality.

1029
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,320
CERN's case

1030
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,320
in the end was solved successfully.

1031
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,320
In her little area

1032
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,320
of caring concern everything was fine

1033
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,320
and on time once the LHC

1034
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,320
started in the season

1035
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,320
last year in 2022.

1036
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,320
Since we had our conversation

1037
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,320
that I shared with you today

1038
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,320
Claire got a prestigious postdoc position

1039
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,320
at an American elite university

1040
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,320
and is now an assistant professor

1041
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,320
at a renowned university in Europe.

1042
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,320
Her ability to become an intravigual

1043
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,320
her cunningness and consistency

1044
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,320
her notes, calculations and devotion

1045
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,320
and a big portion of chance

1046
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,320
secured her a place in the future of high

1047
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,320
energy physics.

1048
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,320
Awards in anthropology in the future.

1049
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,320
Screws as hardware and bugs

1050
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,320
as software may be considered agents

1051
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,320
of ruptures, schemers of cuts.

1052
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,320
They may be seen as vital forces

1053
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,320
shaping human dynamics in a data

1054
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,320
driven work environment.

1055
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,320
Scheming intrigues, plots and weaving

1056
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,320
the future in the now by dealing

1057
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,320
cunningly with collective group memory

1058
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,320
and gaining attention for future

1059
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,320
actions turns into a political tool.

1060
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,320
Differentiating between cuts

1061
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,320
and ruptures helps to distinguish

1062
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,320
between different modes of action

1063
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,320
and physically different actors as

1064
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,320
I learned from and with my colleague

1065
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,320
Lucas Meyerhofer physicist himself.

1066
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,320
It visualizes that hardware, software

1067
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,320
and humans are in seemingly seamless

1068
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,320
spaces always on the verge of disruption.

1069
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,320
It shows how people care

1070
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,320
within and about data driven worlds

1071
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,320
and above all it exemplifies

1072
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,320
that actions are happening in the

1073
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,320
fields of social forces

1074
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,320
and how the discurface structures

1075
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,320
influence actions especially actions

1076
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,320
in the digital era.

1077
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,320
It shows how we evolved from individuals

1078
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,320
to individuals to

1079
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,320
intraviduals when living in our complex

1080
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,320
digital worlds.

1081
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,320
Anthropology as I understand

1082
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,320
our crafty discipline is bound

1083
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,320
to empirical insights

1084
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,320
but as well to theoretical concepts

1085
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,320
no matter how much we put empirical

1086
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,320
fields in our inventory powers at the

1087
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,320
center and it matters what thoughts

1088
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,320
I am thinking and with whom I am

1089
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,320
thinking my thoughts with as Donna

1090
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,320
Haraway reminds us.

1091
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,320
No matter how much we understand

1092
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,320
the discursive structures of truthful

1093
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,320
dispositions, no matter how much we

1094
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,320
are tricked by unconscious drives

1095
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,320
language is the trickster

1096
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,320
and sound can play with meaning.

1097
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,320
Alterity is key

1098
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,320
the rhythm changes everything

1099
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,320
communication is misunderstanding

1100
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,320
and eps cons from economies

1101
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,320
of growth. Alterity

1102
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,320
is key.

1103
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,320
Thinking about a future that does

1104
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,320
not forget where we are coming from

1105
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,320
but understands the horizons

1106
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,320
of our Indo-European spatiotemporal

1107
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,320
housings and movements.

1108
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,320
So where we and how we talk

1109
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,320
and how we frame things

1110
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,320
allows us to recalibrate our own

1111
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,320
being on the planet and asks

1112
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,320
how we transform from humans into

1113
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,320
something we could consider as Terrence.

1114
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,320
Since I am convinced that

1115
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,320
at the core of our problems within

1116
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,320
the Anthropocene lies our ways

1117
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,320
of how we perceive space, time and

1118
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,320
materiality and that is very closely

1119
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,320
tied to our Indo-European language

1120
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,320
system. There are other ways

1121
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,320
to be in the future and we

1122
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,320
as anthropologists are looking for

1123
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,320
traces that lead us there.

1124
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,320
I want to visualize this

1125
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,320
by sharing with you some diagrams

1126
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,320
I made. One inspired through

1127
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,320
re-reading Nikolai Sorin-Tchaikov's

1128
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,320
Two Lenins, a brief anthropology of time

1129
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,320
and the other contemporary

1130
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,320
works in anthropology that

1131
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,320
I try to engage with

1132
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,320
two

1133
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,320
philosophers that I really admire

1134
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,320
very much, Maurice Meloponte

1135
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,320
and Jacques Derrida.

1136
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,320
So in this you can actually

1137
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,320
see it's like a babushka model

1138
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,320
an onion model of how

1139
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,320
we are engaging

1140
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,320
with temporalities and there are different

1141
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,320
ideas of temporality. There's the geopolitical

1142
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,320
temporality or time that you see

1143
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,320
on the outside in the black

1144
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,320
frame and then there's the violet frame

1145
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,320
you could say it's a media technological

1146
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,320
dispositive or apparatus

1147
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,320
that is also creating a certain

1148
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,320
temporality and rhythm.

1149
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,320
These rhythms are going along with each other

1150
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,320
they create already a certain resonance

1151
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,320
a certain form of harmony. Then you have

1152
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,320
a certain temporality, the thought

1153
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,320
styles and the epistemic ways

1154
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,320
of being together so different thought

1155
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,320
collectives to put it with Ludwig Fleck

1156
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,320
who have again their own temporality

1157
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,320
and then you have the yellow

1158
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,320
frame which is the experimental time

1159
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,320
so time of the experiment of the Large Hadron Collider

1160
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,320
where a certain amount of data is taking

1161
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,320
within the time and the fourth

1162
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,320
is actually the knowledge that is

1163
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,320
coming out of this so the gift

1164
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,320
of nature that is appearing

1165
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,320
within the collision of the experiment

1166
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,320
itself. So all these different

1167
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,320
layers of temporality are intersecting

1168
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,320
and in between you have the materiality

1169
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,320
that maybe cuts and you have the

1170
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,320
politics that happening and that's the rhythm

1171
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,320
and that's the bead itself

1172
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,320
that actually is so interesting to

1173
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,320
understand and to describe in anthropology

1174
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,320
itself.

1175
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,320
And on the other hand

1176
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,320
you can see here that's a very classical

1177
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,320
imaginary actually

1178
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,320
how Maurice Maloponte tried to

1179
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,320
show how the past is an

1180
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,320
overlay, it's overlaid

1181
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,320
by different present times.

1182
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,320
So you have here

1183
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,320
the black

1184
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,320
and red line which is

1185
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,320
the timeline, the physical timeline

1186
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,320
and that we have in the Newtonian

1187
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,320
world and the blue

1188
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,320
lines are actually the cuts

1189
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,320
of the now when you go back

1190
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,320
and the black lines that go

1191
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,320
diagonal

1192
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,320
through the blue lines are showing that

1193
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,320
actually each spot when you would

1194
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,320
go into the past are an overlay

1195
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,320
of endlessly amounts of

1196
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,320
past time points of the now

1197
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,320
so that shows what I said initially

1198
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,320
how complex the capturing

1199
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,320
of the past actually is for historiography.

1200
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,320
And on the other hand

1201
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,320
when you do physics and we do this

1202
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,320
hermeneutical cuts as anthropologists

1203
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,320
and the historians when we are

1204
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,320
looking into the past.

1205
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,320
But on the other hand, physicists are trying

1206
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,320
to push this kind of

1207
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,320
experience, space of experience

1208
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,320
when they simulate experiments

1209
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,320
beforehand

1210
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,320
and push the experiential space

1211
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,320
of the experiment into the future

1212
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,320
and have these two

1213
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,320
horizons. On the one hand

1214
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,320
the horizon of theory and on the other hand

1215
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,320
the horizon of the experiment itself.

1216
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,320
And to see this kind of

1217
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,320
congruence with between thinking how

1218
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,320
physicists and computer science

1219
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,320
actually makes us and allows us to rethink

1220
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,320
the horizons of future is

1221
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,320
something that I find very fruitful for my own

1222
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,320
discipline and where I learned a lot of

1223
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,320
physics and computer science and such.

1224
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,320
I did this to remind at the end

1225
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,320
of this talk diagrammatically that it does not

1226
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,320
only matter with whom we are thinking

1227
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,320
thoughts with but also what kind of

1228
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,320
geometries, architectures, diagrams

1229
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,320
and compositions we build when we approach

1230
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,320
any phenomenon including the

1231
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,320
futures and futurities.

1232
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,320
And also in order to question whether some of

1233
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,320
the new materialist

1234
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,320
conceptions about future are actually

1235
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,320
that new.

1236
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,320
Karen Barad's quantum mechanically inspired

1237
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,320
concept of interaction harmonizes

1238
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,320
with historiographical theories

1239
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,320
very well who by definition

1240
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,320
aim to reconsider space, time, materiality

1241
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,320
humans and non-humans alike

1242
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,320
and how things come into being.

1243
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,320
When it comes to study futures

1244
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,320
we need to work with what we have now

1245
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,320
and what we find here.

1246
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,320
We are not living in eternal time-free

1247
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,320
space a place the Greeks called

1248
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,320
Koura filled with eternal

1249
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,320
Aion, the Ian, the eternal.

1250
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,320
We are mortals in this whole game

1251
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,320
depending on chance, kairos,

1252
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,320
luck. No matter how much we travel

1253
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,320
beyond space and time.

1254
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,320
At CERN I observed solitary beings of all

1255
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,320
kind interacting and becoming

1256
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,320
solitary beings which brings me

1257
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,320
back to the tree I observed 12 years ago

1258
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,320
in Vienna. The observer

1259
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,320
me in the window acknowledged exclusive

1260
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,320
moments of each leaf but

1261
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,320
the summer wind just as historical time

1262
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,320
touched all of us.

1263
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,320
As part of one tree these leaves

1264
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,320
are part of one universal.

1265
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,320
I as observer was audience.

1266
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,320
We together were a many world

1267
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,320
already. I listened

1268
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,320
to the sound of leaves

1269
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,320
they brought me to CERN

1270
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,320
and this place to understand what our task

1271
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,320
in virtue as anthropologists is

1272
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,320
when we are doing fieldwork.

1273
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,320
That we are sniffling futures.

1274
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,320
Our binding leaves through words and finding

1275
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,320
traces with forests by summoning

1276
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,320
space and time without

1277
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,320
imperial aims by piecing fragments

1278
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,320
together a part into a unitary

1279
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,320
multiplicity.

1280
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,320
The modernity, the individual, the

1281
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,320
digitality and the future

1282
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,320
is about individual individuality.

1283
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,320
Is the old blind

1284
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,320
in the anthropocene?

1285
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,320
Today, anthropology

1286
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,320
no matter what field it engage in

1287
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,320
is an historically aware discipline.

1288
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,320
That's why it's about

1289
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,320
when you think of current debates on

1290
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,320
restitution of artifacts

1291
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,320
stolen within colonial context maybe this

1292
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,320
happens also in Brussels. It matters

1293
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,320
how you gather your knowledge

1294
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,320
and I do not steal from people at CERN.

1295
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,320
They do exactly know what I'm doing there

1296
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,320
and they're sharing with me because

1297
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,320
they know I care for them and they care for me.

1298
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,320
And it's important

1299
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,320
to know who has a say or the right

1300
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,320
for a history of her own.

1301
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,320
For what has happened to the pyramids what will

1302
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,320
be. In times of

1303
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,320
reconsidering apocal cuts in historical

1304
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,320
rhythmizations due to the anthropocene

1305
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,320
anthropologists have to roam all fields

1306
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,320
as trailblazing tracers.

1307
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,320
I presented you scenes of vulnerability

1308
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,320
all of them physical, one

1309
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,320
material, the screw, the other virtual

1310
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,320
the bugs and the third a discursive one

1311
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,320
which I framed in the term of

1312
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,320
masculinity and subversive actions.

1313
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,320
I tell you ethnographic fictions

1314
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,320
of science based on empirical

1315
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,320
encounters to set your minds in places

1316
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,320
to open horizons of experience

1317
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,320
to take you along my

1318
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,320
storytelling and leave you

1319
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,320
to your own horizons of experience

1320
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,320
to engage in empathy and taking

1321
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,320
the others point of view. For that matters

1322
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,320
matters more than any

1323
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,320
property or appropriation

1324
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,320
in fights, any kind

1325
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,320
of neoliberal

1326
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,320
dispositive of existence we are actually

1327
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,320
all the time treadmilling in.

1328
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,320
We anthropologists are collaborators

1329
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,320
in exchanges, translators

1330
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,320
and voice gippers. We acknowledge

1331
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,320
respect and the value of the other

1332
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,320
as discipline a priori.

1333
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,320
We learned it the hard way

1334
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,320
for empathy is the evergreen

1335
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,320
of world of many worlds.

1336
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,320
Think like a stone long with

1337
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,320
Beth Provenelli or like a

1338
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,320
margulis.

1339
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,320
Think like a mushroom along with

1340
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,320
anatzin or like vertebrae

1341
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,320
in companionship with Donna Haraway.

1342
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,320
See the world from a quantum perspective

1343
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,320
together with Karen Barat

1344
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,320
but let those things in their

1345
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,320
thinness, those beings in their

1346
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,320
beingness be themselves and

1347
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,320
relate as Helen Verand does.

1348
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,320
Take the aliens point of view

1349
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,320
and acknowledge the own alien within

1350
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,320
yourself. Be an interdependent

1351
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,320
member of Arturo Escobar's

1352
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,320
pluriverse and acknowledge your

1353
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,320
individuality along with the

1354
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,320
physicists of my field.

1355
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,320
I finished this talk with the

1356
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,320
question I would love to discuss with you

1357
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,320
and hints of positivist

1358
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,320
teleology put aside and

1359
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,320
that I learned today to ask in

1360
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,320
and through physics. What could

1361
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,320
an interdisciplinary

1362
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,320
collaboration look like in 21-23

1363
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,320
and how would you

1364
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,320
folks think an interdisciplinary

1365
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,320
collaboration across cultures

1366
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,320
of knowledge would be useful

1367
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,320
and fruitful.

1368
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,320
Thank you very much.

1369
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,320
Thank you, Ann.

1370
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,320
Is it okay that we close this

1371
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,320
screen sure that we see each other?

1372
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,320
Everybody sees everybody?

1373
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,320
Will it make sense? Okay,

1374
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,320
that's nice. Just let me

1375
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,320
open this on the...

1376
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,320
How do I do that?

1377
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,320
Thank you

1378
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,320
for your patience.

1379
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,320
It was 10 minutes overdue

1380
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,320
but I hope you didn't lose the

1381
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,320
attention.

1382
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,320
We are all here. So who would like

1383
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,320
to start commenting question?

1384
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,320
Francis. And let's use

1385
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,320
the mic in the row.

1386
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,320
Well, I would like to

1387
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,320
make a very provocative statement

1388
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,320
but before I do so

1389
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,320
I will introduce myself in order to make it

1390
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,320
a little bit less provocative.

1391
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,320
I'm the director here

1392
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,320
of the Centre-Layer Postal.

1393
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,320
I very much agree

1394
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,320
with people like Karen Barat

1395
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,320
about intra-action.

1396
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,320
I've been studying quantum mechanics.

1397
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,320
I've been developing an ontology

1398
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,320
that I call relational agency

1399
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,320
that can be used for post-humanism.

1400
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,320
So I all agree

1401
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,320
about different agency,

1402
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,320
about diversity, about

1403
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,320
the fact that an institute

1404
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,320
like a CERN should be

1405
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,320
as diverse as possible.

1406
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,320
But now comes my provocative statement

1407
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,320
that is that your analysis to me

1408
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,320
sounds quite racist

1409
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,320
and sexist

1410
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,320
because you are analysing

1411
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,320
an ordinary event

1412
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,320
a younger junior person

1413
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,320
who points out a mistake in some

1414
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,320
senior person and the senior person

1415
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,320
not immediately picking it up or not

1416
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,320
being very happy to hear about that

1417
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,320
to me that seems like

1418
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,320
general anthropology

1419
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,320
that would happen in any context

1420
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,320
white or black, masculine

1421
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,320
or feminine

1422
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,320
science or non-science

1423
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,320
if some younger member

1424
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,320
of a tribe would question

1425
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,320
an indigenous elder

1426
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,320
that would also not be taken as seriously

1427
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,320
what happened to Clare Covert

1428
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,320
as far as I understood was nothing bad

1429
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,320
she just was not immediately

1430
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,320
listened to. I think

1431
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,320
these kind of events happen all the time

1432
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,320
in all circumstances

1433
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,320
that this is a masculine

1434
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,320
white European environment

1435
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,320
is actually making

1436
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,320
a racist and sexist assumption

1437
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,320
namely that in non-white

1438
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,320
non-European, non-masculine

1439
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,320
environments this would not happen

1440
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,320
imagine that you would have said

1441
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,320
this is an environment

1442
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,320
with mostly Jews

1443
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,320
and this thing happened there

1444
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,320
people would immediately tell you

1445
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,320
that you are an anti-Semite

1446
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,320
but if you say they are white European males

1447
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,320
somehow it is considered to be

1448
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,320
non-racist, non-sexist

1449
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,320
well I think it is

1450
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,320
yeah thank you very much

1451
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,320
I think there must be a basic misunderstanding

1452
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,320
because I have been quoting people

1453
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,320
I have been quoting and framing

1454
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,320
what people were saying

1455
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,320
so it's not me who says that

1456
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,320
but it's actually the statement of the people themselves

1457
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,320
they were calling it

1458
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,320
in these terms

1459
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,320
I have been just quoting

1460
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,320
and if you consider rightfully

1461
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,320
this as racist and sexist

1462
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,320
then you have to call out

1463
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,320
these women who

1464
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,320
perceive it that way

1465
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,320
so it's not me, I am just here the modest witness

1466
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,320
of their quotations

1467
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,320
and what was of concern to them

1468
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,320
you could

1469
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,320
definitely push this back

1470
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,320
and I perceive this also

1471
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,320
as a pushback

1472
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,320
but

1473
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,320
I just can tell you

1474
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,320
this is just one little piece

1475
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,320
of data of many many many

1476
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,320
and

1477
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,320
if people from the US

1478
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,320
would perceive a certain style

1479
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,320
of reasoning in Europe predominant

1480
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,320
and voice this in

1481
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,320
records it's not me who came up with this

1482
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,320
it's not me who

1483
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,320
is bringing this into

1484
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,320
so yes it is racist

1485
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,320
yes it is sexist but that's

1486
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,320
the data of the people

1487
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,320
and not my own quotation

1488
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,320
and if people are perceiving

1489
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,320
what you were saying this is something

1490
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,320
if you downplaying actually you are downplaying

1491
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,320
Claire

1492
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,320
because for Claire this was very traumatic

1493
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,320
and she is a PhD student

1494
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,320
and that really concerned her

1495
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,320
and I have been spending time with her

1496
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,320
sitting at the restaurant and many people have spent time

1497
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,320
with her and she couldn't sleep

1498
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,320
and she had heart race beating

1499
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,320
very strongly

1500
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,320
to meet this person

1501
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,320
that she was frightened on because he would really scream

1502
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,320
within the team meetings

1503
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,320
and so

1504
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,320
actually I just perceive

1505
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,320
I don't think that you just simply got

1506
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,320
the initial

1507
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,320
thing I'm on your side

1508
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,320
but actually that's the data

1509
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,320
if you say this is not this is something very

1510
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,320
common she has been hurt she had to plot

1511
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,320
and if you're

1512
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,320
then I have to say to you provocatively

1513
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,320
that you actually take the master's perspective

1514
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,320
of the head of an institution

1515
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,320
who is not seeing how those

1516
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,320
people who are servants behind your back

1517
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,320
are actually playing you all the time

1518
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,320
that would be my

1519
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,320
provocative reply to you because

1520
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,320
really that's not my data that's not my words

1521
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,320
that's not my framing that's the framing of the people

1522
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,320
I have been working with and that's not

1523
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,320
a tribe

1524
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,320
that is calling out in elderly

1525
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,320
but these are physicists and that's

1526
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,320
a quite a reductionist

1527
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,320
comparison

1528
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,320
and also playing down the complexities

1529
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,320
of what we call and do not anymore

1530
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,320
actually called tribal societies

1531
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,320
sorry

1532
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,320
well I

1533
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,320
I believe that what you described

1534
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,320
that I very much understand that

1535
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,320
somebody would be traumatized I have

1536
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,320
had similar experiences

1537
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,320
both in the case of myself

1538
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,320
not being listened to

1539
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,320
by an elderly when I was younger

1540
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,320
and vice versa

1541
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,320
I think these things happen all the time

1542
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,320
and they are traumatic but they are part

1543
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,320
of human nature

1544
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,320
implying that it's only

1545
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,320
white males who do it I think is

1546
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,320
very unrealistic

1547
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,320
the white males it will be

1548
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,320
we are on the same side

1549
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,320
my dear I also do not think

1550
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,320
that it's just like a male white thing

1551
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,320
that's how these people perceive it

1552
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,320
and that's interesting as a symptom

1553
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,320
doesn't mean that it's the reality

1554
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,320
that's how these people perceive it

1555
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,320
and actually the question is

1556
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,320
why do they perceive it that way

1557
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,320
why do young women in physics

1558
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,320
perceive it this way

1559
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,320
why would they actually

1560
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,320
be sexist and call it out

1561
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,320
and we have

1562
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,320
also at CERN there's something we call

1563
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,320
the queen bee phenomenon

1564
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,320
you maybe know it from physics or from any other field

1565
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,320
so it's saying that there are few

1566
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,320
women who have come up in leading positions

1567
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,320
and they are queen bees

1568
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,320
that means they can work very well together with

1569
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,320
men but not so well with women

1570
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,320
and they are killing other bee queens

1571
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,320
and at CERN you could study

1572
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,320
for example also very well the queen bee phenomenon

1573
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,320
and

1574
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,320
as I just said that's the death question

1575
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,320
and I just provocatively

1576
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,320
provocatively put it into you

1577
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,320
but

1578
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,320
as the so-called

1579
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,320
diversity and

1580
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,320
gender equality representative

1581
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,320
of the philosophical faculty of my university

1582
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,320
I can tell you women

1583
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,320
and men play the same games and it doesn't matter

1584
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,320
what kind of religion, race, class

1585
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,320
ethnicity they have as a background

1586
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,320
doesn't matter

1587
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,320
but still that's the sources and CERN

1588
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,320
has to deal with this

1589
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,320
and also what I find

1590
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,320
interesting and you know that's not what I want to talk about

1591
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,320
what I find interesting is the more interesting part

1592
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,320
is to put this

1593
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,320
aside and get away

1594
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,320
from this kind of how they perceive it

1595
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,320
be it the capital M guy

1596
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,320
and blaming men and blaming whiteness

1597
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,320
whatever I don't care I just

1598
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,320
don't think that's useful for us

1599
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,320
what I found fascinating is how she actually

1600
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,320
tries to solve a problem

1601
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,320
and steps back from

1602
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,320
her individual perspective

1603
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,320
acknowledges there's a certain leading figure

1604
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,320
who cannot step away

1605
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,320
from his individual's narcissist needs

1606
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,320
and becomes an

1607
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,320
individual playing along

1608
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,320
with other people together

1609
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,320
to come to a common goal and to reach it

1610
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,320
as you did when you were actually young

1611
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,320
and that's something where I think

1612
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,320
what you initially called the relational agency

1613
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,320
and the post humanist

1614
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,320
diversity that you're engaging with

1615
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,320
is something that you actually embodied

1616
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,320
as a sensitive young

1617
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,320
man who did research and experienced

1618
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,320
the same traumatic downplaying

1619
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,320
as Claire in her case

1620
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,320
gendered in your case not gendered

1621
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,320
well in my case

1622
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,320
actually I have been downplayed

1623
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,320
by women professors when I was young

1624
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,320
but so I don't mind

1625
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,320
it doesn't matter the gender

1626
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,320
is not relevant everybody plays these

1627
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,320
political games as soon as they get in

1628
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,320
a position of power

1629
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,320
I really don't think that

1630
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,320
whiteness, Europeaness

1631
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,320
or gender plays a role

1632
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,320
all situations where there is

1633
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,320
an ability to move up in

1634
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,320
a power hierarchy they play political games

1635
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,320
which means that the ones at the higher level

1636
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,320
of the hierarchy don't like to be

1637
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,320
criticised by the ones lower on

1638
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,320
it's universal I don't think it needs

1639
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,320
to be gendered or Europeanized

1640
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,320
or muscularized or whatever

1641
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,320
you have to say this

1642
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,320
to the people I did research with

1643
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,320
and not to me I mean like that's not my point

1644
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,320
it's not I

1645
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,320
I don't think that it has to be gendered

1646
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,320
I just said to you I think

1647
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,320
it doesn't matter who does this people love

1648
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,320
power plays no matter

1649
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,320
but then that's the

1650
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,320
data I just gathered

1651
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,320
it's the data it's not me

1652
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,320
I'm just

1653
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,320
the modest witness here and that's the part

1654
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,320
of the field that I didn't construct but I try

1655
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,320
to show you as an anthropologist is actually

1656
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,320
how

1657
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,320
individuality comes into being

1658
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,320
how although hierarchy is

1659
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,320
preventing a certain functioning

1660
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,320
individual interacting

1661
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,320
and engagement in your times

1662
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,320
a relational agency

1663
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,320
is allowing that things at the end work out

1664
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,320
so

1665
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,320
so we have 40s and then

1666
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,320
Schema 40s

1667
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,320
I cannot

1668
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,320
40s you are muted

1669
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,320
not connected to Mike

1670
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,320
so

1671
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,320
okay so maybe we move to Schema

1672
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,320
and meanwhile you will figure it out okay

1673
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,320
for this

1674
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,320
can you hear me

1675
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,320
yes yes

1676
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,320
thank you very much for your

1677
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,320
interesting presentation

1678
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,320
I wonder if you

1679
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,320
can elaborate a little bit on

1680
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,320
some sort of like incentive models

1681
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,320
that you think can be put into place

1682
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,320
for promoting

1683
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,320
this kind of like

1684
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,320
intra individualization

1685
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,320
especially in interdisciplinary research

1686
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,320
because most of the problems we are facing right now

1687
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,320
you rightly also mentioned

1688
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,320
in your presentation

1689
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,320
are so complex that I think

1690
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,320
we need to move toward this kind of

1691
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,320
perspective

1692
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,320
though I also want to say like

1693
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,320
some part of like this

1694
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,320
profile of mail

1695
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,320
I think it's kind of present

1696
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,320
in some disciplines

1697
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,320
especially like STEM sciences I'm coming from

1698
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,320
that background

1699
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,320
I can see why these women probably

1700
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,320
would witness this kind of like incidents

1701
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,320
do I want to move

1702
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,320
toward this kind of incentive models

1703
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,320
like what kind of environment

1704
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,320
what kind of like

1705
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,320
team or

1706
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,320
arrangements

1707
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,320
should be put into place from your research

1708
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,320
that can kind of promote

1709
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,320
this kind of

1710
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,320
approach and at the same time

1711
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,320
if this is

1712
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,320
like power dynamic

1713
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,320
dynamics emerge from

1714
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,320
somebody having more experiences

1715
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,320
or having a different socio

1716
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,320
technological

1717
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,320
social background

1718
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,320
what kind of like mechanisms

1719
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,320
needs to be in place to prevent

1720
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,320
the

1721
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,320
power dynamics taking over

1722
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,320
positive

1723
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,320
collaborations thank you very much

1724
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,320
thank you Shima

1725
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,320
for these very fundamental questions

1726
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,320
and I have been dealing with these questions myself

1727
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,320
I just I hope

1728
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,320
I can give you some of those

1729
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,320
my thoughts that I think that would be useful

1730
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,320
but that's just like hypothetical

1731
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,320
what I would wish

1732
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,320
so the good thing and the good news

1733
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,320
about CERN is that it works very well

1734
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,320
and what they did actually that it works

1735
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,320
is that they were implementing

1736
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,320
game theory elements

1737
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,320
so certain type of competitiveness

1738
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,320
within the work collaborations

1739
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,320
and there are different styles

1740
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,320
the Atlas collaboration who is

1741
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,320
flatter in its hierarchy

1742
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,320
and there's the CMS collaboration

1743
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,320
which is more competitive and more hierarchical

1744
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,320
so even there there are differences of course

1745
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,320
and there are more or less

1746
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,320
hierarchical

1747
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,320
correlations and situations

1748
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,320
so one cannot give one solution to all

1749
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,320
and this kind of specific

1750
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,320
sample that you showed I showed to you

1751
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,320
is an example of I don't like

1752
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,320
the term but I use it of a toxic

1753
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,320
work group so a work group that doesn't function well

1754
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,320
but of course there are also

1755
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,320
work groups that function well

1756
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,320
and I studied these work groups where it functioned well

1757
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,320
when did it function well

1758
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,320
it functioned well when first

1759
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,320
there was a good communication between

1760
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,320
the authority figures

1761
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,320
the so-called leaders of the teams

1762
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,320
and the PhD students and the early postdocs

1763
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,320
and that was always

1764
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,320
the case when the team leaders were

1765
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,320
still also being part

1766
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,320
of the programming

1767
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,320
and also engaged in the

1768
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,320
updates and upgrades and constantly

1769
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,320
tried to go

1770
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,320
along with the time so not becoming

1771
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,320
just older and experience in politics

1772
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,320
but also still knowing what

1773
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,320
actually the younger ones doing when programming

1774
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,320
and solving the problems on the code

1775
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,320
so it actually asks

1776
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,320
from the authority figures to say close

1777
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,320
to what the younger ones do

1778
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,320
that's one side and the other side

1779
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,320
what I think that would be really good

1780
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,320
on the long run would be

1781
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,320
actually

1782
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,320
a certain form of

1783
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,320
social

1784
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,320
therapeutic work groups where people are able

1785
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,320
to say what they actually feel like

1786
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,320
because if you ask

1787
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,320
the guy that Claire

1788
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,320
is calling out who is

1789
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,320
problematic and who is this

1790
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,320
authority figure that she says

1791
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,320
it's a white male guy of Europe

1792
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,320
if you ask this guy

1793
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,320
who I think by his origin is German

1794
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,320
if you ask this guy why he's

1795
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,320
so choleric and screaming all the time

1796
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,320
and cannot allow mistakes

1797
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,320
cannot admit mistakes

1798
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,320
you might see if he would

1799
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,320
have time that he would say oh I have so

1800
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,320
much responsibility to take

1801
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,320
nobody listens to me I feel

1802
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,320
I'm lost here I'm overworked there

1803
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,320
and so on and so on so actually

1804
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,320
it's a certain mode of taking

1805
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,320
back which I would think would be very

1806
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,320
useful for everybody of us working in

1807
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,320
science and at universities

1808
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,320
in general and that's something that's

1809
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,320
missing a certain form of

1810
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,320
mediation a certain form of

1811
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,320
acknowledging the others that's what I also said at the

1812
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,320
end you know listening to the other person

1813
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,320
taking the other one's point of view also

1814
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,320
what now the director

1815
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,320
of Claire was saying I mean like what

1816
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,320
you're saying is exactly what I wish

1817
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,320
would be something that would be

1818
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,320
implemented so this kind of

1819
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,320
contained groups where people

1820
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,320
could work with each other

1821
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,320
so I think that would be something

1822
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,320
as a that

1823
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,320
would need to be implemented because

1824
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,320
the pressure is so high

1825
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,320
and on the other hand

1826
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,320
what's very interesting and I think what would

1827
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,320
be very useful is if you talk to people at CERN

1828
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,320
I did talk to the psychologists at CERN

1829
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,320
and if and

1830
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,320
they have records they do not get everybody

1831
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,320
but they have statistics

1832
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,320
of the amount of anxieties of sleeplessness

1833
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,320
as a really like

1834
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,320
psychological psychosomatic

1835
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,320
symptoms that appear within

1836
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,320
a certain

1837
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,320
high level research

1838
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,320
environment and

1839
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,320
I think what would really help to just

1840
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,320
use all the technologies we have

1841
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,320
from psychological therapeutics

1842
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,320
to just implement this as mandatory

1843
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,320
way of self-care

1844
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,320
and also group care and then it would

1845
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,320
definitely work better

1846
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,320
but when it comes to the

1847
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,320
fundamental exclusion of

1848
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,320
certain groups who are privileged

1849
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,320
or less privileged

1850
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,320
then it really needs at least in the

1851
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,320
German case we would need definitely

1852
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,320
to support more people from working class

1853
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,320
environments and so on from early on

1854
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,320
and to change the whole curriculum

1855
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,320
from early on to have a different standpoint

1856
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,320
of how

1857
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,320
those STEM fields are

1858
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,320
taught

1859
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,320
I hope this answers a little bit Shima

1860
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,320
could you give me a small feedback

1861
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,320
whether this is a bit helpful

1862
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,320
Yes, it's very interesting

1863
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,320
thank you very much for

1864
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,320
an elaborate answer

1865
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,320
I think

1866
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,320
what I see is that probably

1867
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,320
the kind of mix of highly competitive

1868
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,320
environments and

1869
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,320
I think to some extent also

1870
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,320
maybe so more men

1871
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,320
are actually present in STEM fields

1872
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,320
this is kind of like statistics are out there

1873
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,320
nobody can basically

1874
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,320
ignore them more men are actually

1875
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,320
attracted to these fields

1876
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,320
not just because the field

1877
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,320
promotes men I think it's kind of

1878
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,320
something that is there are so many

1879
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,320
complex reasons that are happening

1880
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,320
that are there that actually causing

1881
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,320
women

1882
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,320
choosing other fields rather than STEM

1883
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,320
fields and I think

1884
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,320
in any kind of field when you have

1885
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,320
this proportionate gender representation

1886
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,320
you can get into some sort of

1887
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,320
like a maladaptive

1888
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,320
dynamics so I think

1889
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,320
this is kind of like

1890
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,320
promoting more women and I think

1891
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,320
what you mentioned I think listening is very

1892
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,320
important I really liked what you mentioned

1893
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,320
bringing more of these

1894
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,320
critical skills like listening, empathy

1895
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,320
and putting yourself in somebody

1896
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,320
else's perspective is I think so fundamental

1897
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,320
in technical fields

1898
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,320
and thank you very much for your

1899
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,320
very interesting presentation

1900
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,320
thank you

1901
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,320
Thank you Shima, just one little thing I want to add

1902
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,320
I asked the leading also

1903
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,320
the director general

1904
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,320
back then at CERN and others

1905
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,320
how they actually deal with this problem

1906
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,320
and they are not very happy that they have just 20%

1907
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,320
women at CERN

1908
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,320
and the problem is that they also

1909
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,320
have just 20% students

1910
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,320
coming to physics

1911
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,320
also it's like the problem

1912
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,320
starts in school

1913
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,320
and they say

1914
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,320
they would love to have more

1915
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,320
female and that's again

1916
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,320
quite sexist as a statement when you think

1917
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,320
about that in the backdrop

1918
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,320
because they say women are

1919
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,320
tending to care more

1920
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,320
active and care more

1921
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,320
about the experiment while males

1922
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,320
are more interested in their own

1923
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,320
success

1924
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,320
so that's also a self description

1925
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,320
which I found

1926
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,320
super sexist and that's

1927
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,320
what I found also very interesting

1928
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,320
and I think that's the point where you nailed

1929
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,320
it is so impressive

1930
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,320
when you go to a place like CERN

1931
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,320
where people really highly fight

1932
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,320
to have a diverse

1933
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,320
reality

1934
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,320
at the end of the day

1935
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,320
it becomes again

1936
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,320
ethnicist, essentializing

1937
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,320
and sexist and racist

1938
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,320
and it even comes to the point

1939
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,320
where Italians are cooking

1940
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,320
their food and the Russians

1941
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,320
are sticking together with

1942
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,320
the Russians and the Bulgarians

1943
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,320
are having their Bulgarian meeting

1944
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,320
and so on and so on

1945
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,320
it's really fascinating how people deal with this

1946
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,320
in a cosmopolitan space

1947
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,320
that has actually the goal

1948
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,320
of a space gender

1949
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,320
sex class

1950
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,320
that do not matter

1951
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,320
and I think that's

1952
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,320
important because if you have

1953
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,320
an ideal of relational

1954
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,320
agency and of a post human

1955
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,320
diversity

1956
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,320
then in a way it's a universal

1957
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,320
goal

1958
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,320
it's a universal hope

1959
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,320
and any universalist

1960
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,320
approach

1961
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,320
is fragmented

1962
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,320
and it becomes a plurality

1963
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,320
when you go to a certain

1964
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,320
specific place and I think that's something

1965
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,320
that I also try to make visible

1966
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,320
and if you are producing these kind

1967
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,320
of individual certain

1968
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,320
communities then you actually could solve

1969
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,320
these problems and I really hope

1970
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,320
that we come to another solution

1971
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,320
because we need different community models

1972
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,320
we need different work models

1973
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,320
because this kind of neoliberal work system

1974
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,320
isn't healthy for anybody of us

1975
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,320
and it will come, it has to come

1976
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,320
at a certain point to end

1977
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,320
maybe not in my lifetime but I hope

1978
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,320
that I will still witness this

1979
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,320
Thank you. For this, how is your sound now?

1980
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,320
There is a message

1981
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,320
Do you want to ask a question now?

1982
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,320
You can hear me!

1983
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,320
Oh, fantastic! I don't know what I have done

1984
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,320
now I think it's already

1985
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,320
past you

1986
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,320
so I'm not going to ask

1987
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,320
any question now, it's already been

1988
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,320
addressed

1989
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,320
No, please Hothis, you cannot

1990
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,320
leave me that way, I feel like I'm sticking with you

1991
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,320
I was wondering whether you have

1992
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,320
ways of being of James Brittle

1993
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,320
No

1994
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,320
He's telling exactly the same thing you are

1995
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,320
but

1996
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,320
from another point of view he's also

1997
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,320
read Barat

1998
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,320
which I will receive

1999
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,320
for Christmas on the tree

2000
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,320
and

2001
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,320
actually

2002
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,320
he's trying to come to the same kind of

2003
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,320
understanding but not on the academic level

2004
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,320
but

2005
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,320
at the post-human level

2006
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,320
the world

2007
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,320
with

2008
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,320
not viewed from humans only

2009
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,320
but to include everybody

2010
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,320
everything

2011
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,320
and to have

2012
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,320
an idea of

2013
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,320
how to find solutions to the fact that

2014
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,320
everything is so binary

2015
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,320
so that's also what's been

2016
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,320
the point of this discussion

2017
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,320
because it's very binary

2018
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,320
it's male-female but you have

2019
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,320
nobody is entirely male and entirely

2020
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,320
female so you already have

2021
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,320
different

2022
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,320
ways of being

2023
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,320
and he wants

2024
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,320
he was talking about

2025
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,320
having computers thinking

2026
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,320
otherwise than binary

2027
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,320
but he's not very concrete about it

2028
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,320
so I don't know whether

2029
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,320
at CERN there because I also

2030
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,320
understood from his book that

2031
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,320
also the computers

2032
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,320
well the computer models they are using

2033
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,320
at CERN are this carol

2034
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,320
Monte Carlo

2035
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,320
theory based so

2036
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,320
actually they are based on

2037
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,320
chance

2038
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,320
and uncertainty so

2039
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,320
I was wondering if they are thinking

2040
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,320
about something else as computers

2041
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,320
which might be more developed

2042
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,320
than

2043
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,320
whatever he points out in his book

2044
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,320
no they don't

2045
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,320
it works very well

2046
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,320
and they are working very precisely

2047
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,320
with their machine learning

2048
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,320
algorithms and the Monte Carlo simulations

2049
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,320
it's really astonishing what they are doing there actually

2050
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,320
it's really amazing

2051
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,320
what they are producing there

2052
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,320
yeah but you are looking

2053
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,320
again we are looking at uncertainty

2054
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,320
yes they approximate

2055
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,320
they approximate it

2056
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,320
and that's where also the playfulness came into being

2057
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,320
that's why I deal a lot with playing games

2058
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,320
because they have lots of rules

2059
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,320
and uncertainty and chance of playing along

2060
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,320
but they are not looking for another

2061
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,320
system beyond the binary model

2062
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,320
they are not working on this

2063
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,320
it's not their topic

2064
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,320
would be maybe something they could engage with

2065
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,320
but they are much more interested currently

2066
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,320
in medical applications

2067
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,320
of what they are doing because it's very useful

2068
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,320
for example fighting cancer and so on

2069
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,320
so that's something

2070
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,320
they look into and also

2071
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,320
saving energy

2072
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,320
it's something they are really interested in

2073
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,320
because CERN uses a lot of energy

2074
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,320
but also has to deal with the energy problem

2075
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,320
it tries to find solutions

2076
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,320
so many people are engaging there thinking to solve that problem

2077
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,320
also fighting fake news

2078
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,320
it's something that is very important to them

2079
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,320
and also what is a fun fact

2080
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,320
is the Claire

2081
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,320
that I interviewed later on

2082
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,320
she came out as non-binary

2083
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,320
I didn't say it in that moment

2084
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,320
because she has been read as female

2085
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,320
and she has been talking a lot about this

2086
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,320
but later on she came out as non-binary

2087
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,320
so non-binary is more

2088
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,320
exists at CERN

2089
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,320
but

2090
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,320
I was very much fascinated

2091
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,320
when I entered the STEM field

2092
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,320
how much all of this

2093
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,320
matters still

2094
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,320
even if I wish it wouldn't

2095
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,320
and also I think that

2096
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,320
what I try to

2097
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,320
what is very clear from you

2098
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,320
is that it really doesn't

2099
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,320
that's why I talked about Terrence

2100
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,320
instead of humans

2101
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,320
it is that there are alliances

2102
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,320
and I'm really putting aside

2103
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,320
the humans along with the algorithms

2104
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,320
with the computer

2105
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,320
or with a bug and so on

2106
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,320
and I think that's very interesting

2107
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,320
also to think along that way

2108
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,320
and to step out of this

2109
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,320
and from a physicist's perspective

2110
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,320
you can start us, right?

2111
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,320
Well, yes

2112
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,320
That's clear

2113
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,320
Thank you, Rockwantum

2114
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,320
Yeah

2115
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,320
Anna, thank you for your presentation

2116
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,320
I just missed a part of the

2117
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,320
discussion before as my internet

2118
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,320
went down

2119
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,320
I also want to say

2120
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,320
Centro Karsch from Thomas

2121
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,320
because he had an urgent meeting

2122
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,320
to make it

2123
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,320
but I was just thinking that

2124
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,320
you just mentioned about

2125
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,320
sort of this both humanist

2126
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,320
perspective or maybe transhumanist

2127
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,320
I don't know if you would call it

2128
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,320
a sort of transhumanist perspective

2129
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,320
like having also algorithms

2130
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,320
and

2131
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,320
hardware as an

2132
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,320
equal being

2133
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,320
Well, that's sometimes quite difficult

2134
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,320
especially when talking about

2135
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,320
AI or maybe advanced technologies

2136
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,320
that sometimes these types

2137
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,320
of human-made

2138
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,320
artifacts are placed

2139
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,320
above

2140
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,320
or more there still

2141
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,320
seems to be a hierarchy

2142
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,320
that people are talking within these

2143
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,320
sectors like

2144
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,320
within STEM sectors

2145
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,320
there seems to be a bit of a bias

2146
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,320
between

2147
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,320
technology and certain minorities

2148
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,320
Do you sort of

2149
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,320
what's your perspective on that?

2150
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,320
My perspective on that

2151
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,320
is now I give you a very fun

2152
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,320
like please take this with a

2153
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,320
big grain of irony

2154
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,320
so in the 1970s

2155
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,320
physics came

2156
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,320
to a certain end

2157
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,320
epistemically and technologically

2158
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,320
and also as you might know

2159
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,320
lots of

2160
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,320
physicists were trained

2161
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,320
and then there were many people who didn't have a job

2162
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,320
but there was LSD

2163
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,320
and there were other drugs

2164
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,320
that allowed them to think further

2165
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,320
and they really took these drugs and then Apple came

2166
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,320
into being and many other funny things

2167
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,320
like for example string theory

2168
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,320
and I think what you describe right now is

2169
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,320
a time where we are living in a

2170
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,320
hyper realistic time

2171
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,320
where these kind of mind expanding

2172
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,320
experiences where you understand

2173
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,320
as when people

2174
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,320
who have taken LSD they would always describe

2175
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,320
this kind of we are one world

2176
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,320
and this postal humanist perspective is something

2177
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,320
that they are really seeing when they

2178
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,320
are taking these kind of

2179
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,320
mushroom derivatives

2180
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,320
that we are living

2181
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,320
in a time where we're coming through technology

2182
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,320
and that's fascinating to the same point

2183
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,320
because the transhumanist perspective

2184
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,320
and the post humanist terminology

2185
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,320
emerged by Andrew Pickering and others

2186
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,320
who studied in the 1990s physics

2187
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,320
high energy physics

2188
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,320
and what you describe in the hierarchy

2189
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,320
I think is still a narcissist mirroring

2190
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,320
so they look at the stuff they created

2191
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,320
and since they want to be

2192
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,320
big and taller than they are

2193
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,320
actually they make what they

2194
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,320
created bigger and taller as it

2195
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,320
actually is and I think

2196
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,320
this will all be played

2197
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,320
unfortunately due to the climate

2198
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,320
crisis we are experiencing

2199
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,320
and all the augmenting crisis

2200
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,320
this will be put into place

2201
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,320
and I am at this point

2202
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,320
very how should I say

2203
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,320
guarded optimistic

2204
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,320
that although we are undergoing

2205
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,320
these kind of challenges and undergoing

2206
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,320
these kind of crazy fights

2207
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,320
of identity

2208
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,320
politics that I personally do not like

2209
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,320
at all and people who

2210
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,320
would be racist and

2211
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,320
would be sexist and would be techno

2212
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,320
optimist and so on say yes

2213
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,320
we go to the Mars and so on

2214
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,320
that we are coming back to a

2215
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,320
perspective where what you're

2216
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,320
following at the clear

2217
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,320
is actually the future and that's

2218
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,320
something that I'm also working on that's why I'm very

2219
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,320
grateful that you invited me because

2220
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,320
we are working on the same

2221
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,320
topic and people around the world

2222
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,320
are doing what you do what I

2223
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,320
do and that's something where we have

2224
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,320
to stick together and sometimes

2225
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,320
we might have to go into subversion

2226
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,320
and we have to use it to play

2227
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,320
like Claire played the dominant

2228
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,320
ruling society we're living

2229
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,320
in but I think that at the

2230
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,320
end of the day we will come to that point

2231
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,320
and I really hope

2232
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,320
for that one of when the research

2233
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,320
that you do will also contribute

2234
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,320
to that bigger goal

2235
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,320
Thanks Anne, I hope so

2236
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,320
I hope so as well

2237
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,320
it will be this interesting thing

2238
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,320
to touch on, thank you

2239
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,320
I also feel like

2240
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,320
in education or sort of

2241
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,320
this identity politics

2242
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,320
that even like through education

2243
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,320
or people choosing a certain

2244
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,320
that also in education there should be

2245
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,320
a lot more trans-disciplinarity and I think also

2246
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,320
what you talked about during

2247
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,320
your talk that

2248
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,320
technical people also

2249
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,320
need humanities

2250
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,320
sort of this whole

2251
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,320
being able to place

2252
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,320
things in a bigger perspective

2253
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,320
and perhaps that would, I don't know

2254
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,320
if it would help like if you have a trans-disciplinarity

2255
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,320
team of trans-disciplinary

2256
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,320
people that would also maybe

2257
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,320
or that they might

2258
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,320
be more

2259
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,320
able to place themselves in another person

2260
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,320
like be able to sort of see

2261
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,320
or be

2262
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,320
sort of mindful about having a different

2263
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,320
perspective or that they are

2264
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,320
biased in a certain way

2265
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,320
or is this something that people need to

2266
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,320
learn or

2267
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,320
become aware of?

2268
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,320
Yeah, I totally agree

2269
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,320
I think that will be the future and it's hard

2270
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,320
to accept for some

2271
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,320
but

2272
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,320
and I'm very happy that for example

2273
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,320
the Centadio Apostol exists and that you brought it

2274
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,320
into being Mr. Director, please excuse me

2275
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,320
that I was

2276
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,320
challenging your challenge

2277
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,320
but

2278
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,320
I really think that we will have

2279
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,320
these kinds of trends, we need it, we need

2280
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,320
humanities, we need to survive these days

2281
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,320
because we are

2282
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,320
not from an economical

2283
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,320
neoliberal perspective, we do not seem

2284
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,320
to be useful but in

2285
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,320
10 to 20 years many computer scientists

2286
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,320
will end up without

2287
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,320
job because AI took their job

2288
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,320
and then it comes back to interpretation

2289
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,320
and then comes back to the

2290
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,320
hermeneutics and then it comes back to the humanities

2291
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,320
and social science because what

2292
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,320
AI is producing is

2293
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,320
boring, mediocre narratives

2294
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,320
and when it comes out

2295
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,320
comes to the point where it becomes

2296
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,320
disturbing, where the human factor

2297
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,320
plays into, that's something

2298
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,320
where we come back into it

2299
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,320
when resoric becomes again

2300
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,320
important and also hermeneutical understanding

2301
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,320
We have one question from the room

2302
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,320
and then 40 seconds, okay?

2303
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,320
First of all, thank you for

2304
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,320
this interesting talk

2305
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,320
Dr. Anne

2306
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,320
my name is Fabrizio

2307
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,320
I'm a student

2308
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,320
and a PhD student here in CLEA

2309
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,320
and I would like to ask

2310
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,320
the next question

2311
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,320
in a

2312
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,320
disruptive technology where we live

2313
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,320
right now

2314
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,320
I think we could

2315
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,320
use the

2316
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,320
anthropology in order to

2317
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,320
empower our workers

2318
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,320
or workers

2319
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,320
In your opinion

2320
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,320
how would you use

2321
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,320
the best of anthropology

2322
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,320
in order to improve

2323
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,320
the resilience

2324
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,320
of

2325
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,320
supply chains

2326
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:26,320
as you know the supply chain

2327
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,320
is a

2328
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,320
group of business

2329
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,320
excellence that are

2330
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,320
integrated in a

2331
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,320
network that works in a

2332
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,320
like a one system

2333
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,320
and that will be my question

2334
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,320
how would you use the

2335
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,320
best of anthropology

2336
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,320
in order to improve the resilience

2337
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,320
of the supply chain

2338
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,320
thank you

2339
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,320
Thank you very much again

2340
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,320
the question is what kind of supply chains should be improved

2341
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,320
some supply chains

2342
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,320
I don't want to have improved

2343
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,320
where I think they are not serving any goals

2344
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,320
so whenever it comes to

2345
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,320
the logic of growth

2346
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,320
we're coming to an end

2347
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,320
and whenever it comes to exploiting the earth

2348
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,320
and having this idea that we're taking more

2349
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,320
and more out it also comes to an end

2350
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,320
because that's what we do also to ourselves

2351
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,320
to the world out

2352
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,320
so I think one thing is really to show

2353
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,320
that a certain idea of burnout doesn't work anymore

2354
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,320
burning out the energy

2355
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,320
of ourselves or taking

2356
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,320
extracting everything what we could do

2357
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,320
and that's what we should actually cut

2358
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,320
or say as anthropologists here as a rupture

2359
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,320
that's the end it doesn't work anymore

2360
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,320
we cannot relate anymore to the world

2361
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,320
and the other would really bring us back

2362
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,320
bring us back

2363
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,320
with technologies of embodiment

2364
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,320
with technologies that we

2365
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,320
anthropologists when we do field work

2366
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,320
because when we go into another society

2367
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,320
and we do

2368
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,320
transform we are prepared

2369
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,320
and we have technologies to

2370
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,320
to be resilient ourselves

2371
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,320
to not fall or to survive

2372
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,320
what we call the culture shock

2373
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,320
and we experience usually culture shocks

2374
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,320
after two months we have the field diary

2375
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,320
we have certain forms of supervision and so on

2376
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,320
and we have all of this also

2377
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,320
in Europe already developed

2378
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:10,320
we have a whole apparatus of care

2379
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,320
and I think that's where

2380
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,320
that's where I see a future

2381
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,320
and that would also not only

2382
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,320
say in an essential way

2383
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,320
anthropology shows are people

2384
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,320
from Belgium are that way

2385
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,320
and if you're coming from Mexico

2386
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,320
then you have to deal with the Belgians

2387
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,320
this way and please Belgians

2388
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,320
please acknowledge that you do not understand

2389
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,320
how it feels to lose

2390
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,320
your environment when you're from a

2391
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,320
Amazonian society or so something like that

2392
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,320
I think that's

2393
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,320
not something where we are there

2394
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,320
to just mediate or be the

2395
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,320
testimonies of other cultures

2396
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,320
but what we could do is just really

2397
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,320
relate between the different perspectives

2398
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,320
and help others to see themselves

2399
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,320
I think that would be one possible solution

2400
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,320
that's also where art comes into being

2401
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,320
and in an ever more

2402
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,320
entangled world

2403
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,320
where people are coming from

2404
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,320
all over the world to Europe

2405
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,320
and Europe itself

2406
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,320
is turning into deep

2407
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,320
crisis one really has to ask also

2408
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:10,320
what are the laws

2409
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,320
the ideals

2410
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,320
and the fights we in Europe have been fighting

2411
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,320
and that's the good side also

2412
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,320
that's also something I want to say

2413
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,320
but this reasonable European man

2414
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,320
that the Americans criticized

2415
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,320
in this

2416
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,320
Fieldburg snippets I presented to you

2417
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,320
on the other hand CERN

2418
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,320
is

2419
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,320
the outcome of the Second World War

2420
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,320
where physicists

2421
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,320
from different nations fought

2422
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,320
against each other

2423
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,320
but instead of producing a bomb

2424
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,320
they really want to find knowledge

2425
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,320
and they want to show how cosmopolitan

2426
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,320
work

2427
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,320
is possible

2428
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,320
how you really can pursue a goal

2429
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,320
and I showed you the destructive

2430
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,320
side of this the ruptures the cuts

2431
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,320
where it doesn't work

2432
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,320
but that doesn't mean that the ideas

2433
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,320
and the goals that CERN produces

2434
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,320
aren't something that I personally as a European think

2435
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,320
I'm standing for democracy

2436
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,320
the ideal of equality even

2437
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,320
if it's not working criticizing

2438
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,320
a certain non-democratic hierarchy

2439
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,320
and so on and so on

2440
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,320
so I think that's something that we also

2441
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,320
have to do as anthropologists

2442
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,320
to say okay that's a certain kind of

2443
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,320
standard we have been working on

2444
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,320
and even if we decolonize

2445
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,320
everything we have to rethink

2446
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,320
what kind of criticism

2447
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,320
of colonial power relations

2448
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,320
actually brought humanism into being

2449
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,320
and where post-humanism

2450
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,320
is a child of these kind

2451
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,320
of developments as such

2452
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,320
I hope that somehow

2453
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,320
gives you a little bit of

2454
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,320
an answer to this and I think that would

2455
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,320
actually put a resilience to the

2456
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,320
what you call supply chains

2457
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,320
or the resilience to certain societies

2458
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,320
that fight for the equality

2459
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,320
of people and fight and have

2460
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,320
also attained the equality

2461
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,320
of for example women and men

2462
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,320
or the equality

2463
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,320
of voting no matter what kind

2464
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,320
and how much money you have

2465
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,320
or whether you are aristocrat or not

2466
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,320
What is?

2467
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,320
Yes, so I want to come back

2468
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,320
to the question of trans-

2469
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,320
trans-civil narrative

2470
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,320
so I am doing a PhD

2471
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,320
in philosophy on being

2472
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,320
and becoming but it's

2473
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,320
very much based on quantum

2474
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:24,320
physics so I've been reaching

2475
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,320
out to Rovalli and Tonnelli

2476
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,320
at first

2477
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,320
they

2478
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,320
answered the questions I ask

2479
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,320
and then when I asked

2480
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,320
when they

2481
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,320
and Rovalli even said

2482
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,320
I don't know any philosopher being

2483
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,320
occupied with

2484
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,320
quantum physics

2485
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,320
well he doesn't know Barrett

2486
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,320
I didn't know her then either

2487
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,320
so I pointed into Whitehead

2488
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,320
but at one point in time when I say

2489
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,320
do you want to get involved with my

2490
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,320
PhD they don't have time

2491
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,320
so much for trans-discipline

2492
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,320
yeah

2493
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,320
Yeah, that's a good

2494
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,320
point I have been collaborating

2495
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,320
with physicists in a

2496
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,320
class of excellence at Hommel University

2497
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,320
and it was very interesting

2498
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,320
where you also would experience this hierarchy

2499
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,320
of STEM versus humanities

2500
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,320
philosophy and so on

2501
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,320
and that comes back to what Flo

2502
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,320
was actually saying and that's where I hope

2503
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,320
for the future generation

2504
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,320
and that's interesting I talked

2505
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,320
to Lisa Randall

2506
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,320
and she was very much open

2507
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,320
and she waited for

2508
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,320
news and wanted to engage

2509
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,320
by Carlo Rovalli again

2510
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,320
I somehow

2511
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,320
have encountered many of

2512
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,320
these physicists who are not

2513
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,320
seeing that there is a ton of philosophy

2514
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,320
engaging with this and what

2515
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,320
I also tried to say

2516
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,320
initially in my talk

2517
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,320
nothing that quantum mechanics

2518
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,320
has to give epistemologically

2519
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,320
is new

2520
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,320
to history nor anthropology

2521
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,320
it is not

2522
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,320
it's rather that actually

2523
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,320
Schrödinger's cat

2524
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,320
tried to prevent

2525
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,320
to bring these two worlds together

2526
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,320
for certain reasons of dominance

2527
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,320
of physics and then you have the new

2528
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,320
age movement and so on which is making

2529
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,320
this thing fall apart and then again

2530
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,320
people would say oh no we don't go into esoterics

2531
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,320
but if you go today in science and

2532
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,320
technology studies or if you go to

2533
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,320
Hawaiian philosophers

2534
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,320
and Hawaiian cosmologists as I just

2535
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,320
have been last month at

2536
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,320
a big 4S conference

2537
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,320
you will find

2538
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,320
the exact same idea

2539
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,320
that you as a philosophy

2540
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,320
of healing that is

2541
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,320
combining the people of Hawaii

2542
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,320
of people of aboriginal societies

2543
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,320
in Australia, in New Zealand

2544
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,320
or people who do quantum mechanics

2545
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,320
and take this series

2546
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,320
and transfer it into the world

2547
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,320
and it's sad that Ovelli insists

2548
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,320
on his position of power

2549
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,320
but that relates again to the imperial

2550
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,320
power position of physics

2551
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,320
as such that is falling

2552
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,320
as much

2553
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,320
as you can see also with

2554
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,320
the falling

2555
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,320
part of believing in science as such

2556
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,320
with the rise of all these

2557
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,320
kind of destabilizations of fact

2558
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,320
making through

2559
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:14,320
all these people who believe in whatever

2560
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,320
kind of piracies.

2561
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,320
I suggest you

2562
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,320
send me the email address of

2563
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,320
the Lauren who is interested

2564
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,320
and then another thing

2565
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,320
is I do think

2566
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,320
quantum physics

2567
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,320
shakes ontology

2568
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,320
What kind of ontology?

2569
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,320
The ontology as we see it

2570
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,320
as the philosophy of being

2571
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,320
it makes it

2572
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,320
dynamic instead of static

2573
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,320
oh yes it does

2574
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,320
and so

2575
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,320
I think the ontological

2576
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,320
implications

2577
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,320
of quantum physics are more

2578
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,320
important and if

2579
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,320
you have an ontological

2580
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,320
problem

2581
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,320
you cannot even have an epistemology

2582
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,320
you don't have anything anymore

2583
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,320
so you have to go to another kind

2584
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,320
of thinking about

2585
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,320
life

2586
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,320
which is no longer in being

2587
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,320
but also in becoming

2588
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,320
Yes

2589
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,320
for example if you lead

2590
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,320
Elizabeth Povinelli, geontologies of the

2591
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,320
otherwise as anthropologists

2592
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:22,320
would deal with this also Mackenzie

2593
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,320
Warke

2594
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,320
Molecular Red

2595
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,320
It's a beautiful book

2596
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,320
I suggest that I

2597
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:32,320
ask Marta for your email address

2598
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,320
and then you

2599
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,320
send me your references because this is

2600
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,320
not going to work here. Wonderful

2601
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,320
Okay no I totally agree with you

2602
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,320
it does and that's the beauty of it

2603
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,320
I agree with you

2604
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,320
Okay Francis

2605
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,320
Let me

2606
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,320
take the position which I

2607
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,320
not used to take of

2608
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,320
defending the STEM sciences here

2609
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,320
I'm personally

2610
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,320
with one foot in STEM one foot

2611
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,320
in the humanities I'm

2612
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,320
officially a philosopher

2613
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,320
connected to the Department of Philosophy

2614
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,320
my PhD is in physics

2615
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,320
but it was actually more about the philosophy

2616
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,320
of quantum mechanics

2617
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,320
so I know the domain quite well

2618
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,320
and I want to say that

2619
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:16,320
it's not sufficient to say there is some similarity

2620
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,320
between Hawaiian philosophy

2621
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,320
or Daoist philosophy

2622
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,320
and quantum mechanics to say that

2623
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,320
well they are equal there at the same level

2624
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,320
Quantum mechanics

2625
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,320
is a highly technical

2626
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,320
domain with a lot of deep

2627
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,320
philosophical problems but the technical

2628
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,320
domain means that there is quite a lot

2629
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,320
of very hard mathematics in there

2630
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,320
you can't do without it

2631
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,320
it's thanks to these mathematics that we can

2632
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:42,320
build all these

2633
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,320
transistors and lasers

2634
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,320
and all these incredible

2635
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,320
technological applications of quantum mechanics

2636
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,320
this is

2637
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,320
something there are no shortcuts for that

2638
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,320
it's not sufficient to say

2639
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,320
I have heard

2640
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,320
Hawaiian philosophy they say the same as quantum mechanics

2641
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,320
maybe at some level

2642
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,320
they say the same but if you want

2643
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,320
to study quantum mechanics you have to go to

2644
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,320
all the work

2645
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,320
and it is a lot of work

2646
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,320
I have done part of it I have given it up

2647
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,320
at a certain moment and moved my career in a different

2648
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,320
direction

2649
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,320
Derek Arts who was the former director

2650
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,320
of Claire is still working in quantum mechanics

2651
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,320
he's still coming

2652
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,320
with new ideas and he still

2653
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,320
has to admit that there are lots of things

2654
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,320
he doesn't understand so

2655
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,320
it's not a question of saying yes but these people

2656
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,320
they just work from

2657
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,320
a position of authority

2658
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,320
so they don't listen to people

2659
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,320
who have new age ideas or who have

2660
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,320
whatever ideas

2661
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:40,320
no these people know that

2662
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:42,320
to go into the depth you really

2663
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,320
need to go

2664
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,320
to all the hard

2665
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,320
work all the mathematics

2666
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,320
and at that level

2667
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,320
you can't have a conversation just with a philosopher

2668
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,320
if the philosopher goes

2669
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,320
to all the hard work and goes to all the mathematics

2670
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,320
then maybe you can go

2671
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,320
more deeply into the

2672
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,320
what quantum mechanics really means

2673
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,320
because as Feynman said

2674
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,320
if you believe you understand quantum mechanics

2675
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,320
you haven't understood it

2676
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:10,320
Yes Francis you are opening

2677
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,320
many doors and I really think that

2678
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,320
you're just listening half of what I'm

2679
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,320
saying sometimes because

2680
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,320
that's exactly what I'm thinking

2681
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,320
I totally agree

2682
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:22,320
and I cannot agree more after spending

2683
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,320
eight years with physicists

2684
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,320
studying at the university

2685
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,320
sitting there

2686
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,320
taking classes in the history of physics

2687
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,320
taking classes in physics

2688
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,320
of different levels

2689
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,320
and also spending time with quantum mechanics

2690
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,320
people with computer simulations

2691
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,320
people and high energy physics people

2692
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,320
and that's why I'm sometimes also very

2693
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,320
careful when I see people

2694
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,320
who are perceiving themselves as Hawaiian

2695
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,320
cosmologists as indigenous cosmologists

2696
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,320
saying

2697
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,320
what people in quantum mechanics

2698
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,320
say

2699
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:56,320
that's actually what we are also saying

2700
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,320
I wrote an article on ontological opportunism

2701
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,320
where I

2702
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,320
describe exactly that kind of communication

2703
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,320
between a Lakuta Su

2704
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,320
cosmologist on the one hand

2705
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,320
and a physicist at CERN

2706
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:10,320
where the Lakuta Su

2707
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,320
would actually see in the exchange particle

2708
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,320
Iktomi

2709
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,320
the trickster god

2710
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,320
and would study

2711
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,320
from his perspective

2712
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,320
quantum mechanics

2713
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,320
physicists try to translate and get into

2714
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,320
resonance with this

2715
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,320
and

2716
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,320
there is no doubt

2717
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:32,320
that one thing is mathematics

2718
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,320
and as you said also Feynman was saying

2719
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,320
when you think you have understood it

2720
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,320
you're not understanding quantum mechanics

2721
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,320
that's one thing

2722
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,320
and the second thing is that something I asked

2723
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,320
always theoretical physicists

2724
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:46,320
when I interviewed them was

2725
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,320
has mathematics been

2726
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,320
invented or found

2727
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:52,320
and the most witty answer

2728
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:54,320
to this question was by Lisa Randall

2729
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,320
because she wasn't sure about it

2730
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,320
whether it's invented or found

2731
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,320
and she said if we have

2732
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,320
invented it then we found

2733
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:04,320
a very good thing

2734
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,320
with mathematics

2735
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,320
so I totally agree with you

2736
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,320
and I think one has to be aware of this

2737
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:12,320
but now we are

2738
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,320
coming to strategic

2739
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,320
alliances again

2740
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,320
and the strategic alliance

2741
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,320
between the way

2742
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,320
quantum mechanics allows to understand

2743
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,320
the world even if you do not get it

2744
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,320
on the basis of mathematics on the one hand

2745
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,320
and those indigenous cosmologies

2746
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,320
are very useful and necessary

2747
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,320
to save Gaia

2748
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,320
so it's just a strategic alliance

2749
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:36,320
discussing

2750
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:38,320
who has here what kind of

2751
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,320
you know deeper foundation

2752
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,320
for me not my point

2753
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,320
I just want to have a strategic alliance to save this planet

2754
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,320
and to come to a better living together

2755
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,320
that's all what I want

2756
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:50,320
so thank you Francis for pointing this out

2757
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,320
because that's at most important

2758
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,320
Zlatka

2759
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,320
Thank you

2760
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:04,320
for your

2761
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,320
interesting presentation

2762
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:08,320
I first would like to

2763
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,320
second one what

2764
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,320
