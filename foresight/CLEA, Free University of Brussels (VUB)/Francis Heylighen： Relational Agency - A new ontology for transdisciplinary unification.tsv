0	11000	We will start the seminar. I think most people know me here. I'm Francis Heligand. I'm presently the director of the Centre-LÃ©on Apostle.
11000	24000	And I'm going to talk about a topic which I consider to be very important. Of course, you would like to believe that all the topics you speak about are important, but this one for me is more important than other talks I have given in the centre.
24000	39000	I think it's a kind of a unification of a very large number of things I have been doing and not only a unification of things I have been doing, but as I hope to argue, a unification actually potentially for the whole of science.
39000	45000	That's why I call it a new ontology for a transdisciplinary unification.
45000	59000	So relational agency, it's a recent term. I'm not 100% sure that I will stick to that term. There may be better terms, but I think it captures very well what this new ontology is about.
59000	65000	So let me start by saying what is an ontology.
65000	69000	Okay.
69000	76000	So, starting with the term ontology, which may not be common to everybody.
76000	84000	So an ontology originally was a term in philosophy that was speaking about being on the things that exist.
84000	104000	More practically an ontology is a theory about the fundamental constituents of reality. Whatever world you have, you assume that reality is constituted at the basis of something extremely fundamental, the essential, the elements or the building blocks of the things that exist.
104000	113000	So any kind of a worldview or metaphysics must have an ontology at its foundations and often the ontology is implicit.
113000	123000	But lately, more and more people are interested in looking explicitly at ontology because changing the ontology changes your whole worldview.
123000	137000	So there are some classical ontologies, for example, materialism is that the idea that at the bottom everything consists of matter, but then there is idealism that says no in the end everything consists of ideas.
137000	144000	And there are some other versions like social constructivism where everything after all is a social construction.
144000	157000	I'm not going to detail the different ontologies that exist, but go to the ontology which is kind of the most standard, the most default one, the most classical Western ontology.
157000	161000	Not that I claim that this is purely Western.
161000	170000	This ontology I'm pretty sure also in other world views, but it's the one that we associate it most with the scientific Western world view.
170000	181000	And more specifically by what I have called in my research, the Newtonian world view, the Newtonian world view that meets the world view of classical mechanics.
181000	195000	And this ontology is implicitly since most scientific theories later developed on the basis of this Newtonian world view, most scientific theories kind of implicitly assume this ontology.
195000	207000	And this ontology why is it so widespread, because it's simple, because it's concrete, because it's intuitive, and because you can express it very nicely in mathematical ways.
207000	211000	And that's what I call the ontology of objects.
211000	219000	So, we can say that as the whole Western world view originated really with the ancient Greeks.
219000	235000	These two come from ancient Greek philosophy, and one philosopher there was Parmenides, who had something against change, who was saying that change is an illusion, the only thing that exists are eternal permanent things.
235000	246000	Prater was looking at these eternal permanent things as what he called absolute forms, IDs, so the IDs are there eternally.
246000	254000	And finally you had Aristotle, who was a student of Prater and Aristotle was more practical was more empirically minded.
254000	267000	He of course was not going to deny that objects could change, but he still kept his idea of the absolute essential form by speaking about objects having essential properties.
267000	272000	So the essential properties, the essences are what define the object.
272000	281000	So this is the ontology of objects, you have objects that have certain essences that are in there.
281000	290000	So let's look at it more concretely, I have chosen here a picture of a break as kind of a default prototypical object.
290000	303000	What is this prototypical object, it's a thing that is this thing that means we can very clearly see where it begins and where it ends, it's located in space there is a border around it.
303000	308000	And it is inert, it just sits there.
308000	313000	It's independent, it's absolute, it just is.
313000	318000	It doesn't do anything or less some force moves it.
318000	327000	So what is standard object have as property is they just remain the way they are they have these essential properties.
327000	331000	They remain identical to themselves they keep these properties.
331000	344000	And of course we want to describe change and not all things are static in the world. So, what Aristotle did to solve that problem is that he distinguished between the essential properties the ones that do not change.
344000	359000	And what he called the accidental properties. And with accidental properties we think about things like the position of that break, or the speed with which you throw it so you can imagine that that break is moved in different orientations.
359000	367000	The position or the position with the witness, it's accidental, it's not essential, it does not define the break.
367000	378000	And if those accidental properties change, that is because something else, namely some outside force such as gravity has made the big move from one position to the own.
378000	385000	So the ontology of objects assume that objects are just their passive, they do not change on their own.
385000	404000	So, after Aristotle this ontology has developed further in the direction of materialism, and that is the ID objects are made from an inner substance a substance is kind of what carries the object, what shapes the object.
404000	413000	Substances can be remodelled or rearranged but the substances are assumed to be eternal to be always the same.
413000	420000	So a substance is something that just is there, it can't be created, can't be destroyed, it can't be transformed.
420000	429000	In our modern scientific world we assume that the fundamental substance of the world is what we call matter, so it's a materialistic world view.
429000	439000	And we assume that matter ultimately consists of particles which are kind of the smallest objects, the elementary units, the smallest possible objects.
439000	444000	So that's the basis of our traditional world view.
444000	457000	In this world view also entails this what we know as reductionism which does that, yeah, if everything consists of objects and objects themselves consist of smaller objects and these smaller objects, eventually consist of particles.
457000	459000	Well, actually that's all there is.
459000	462000	If you want to understand something.
462000	478000	You can get it as some arrangement or assembly of particles. And if you want to know what happens to that object, you just need to look at what these particles are doing, meaning how they are moving in space and time.
478000	492000	Why do they move, because there are forces, and there we have the essence of the Newtonian world view, you have massive objects that move under the influence of forces, such as gravity.
492000	499000	So in such a world view, yeah, actually you can't really have anything new.
499000	512000	Everything exists just out of these bits of matter, which are essentially identical, you may be rearranging them but nothing novel can emerge, there can be no evolution, there can be no creativity.
512000	528000	And moreover, in the Newtonian world view, you assume that all these changes, that's to say the forces acting on these objects, they are deterministic so there is no uncertainty, there is no indeterminacy, there is no freedom, and therefore there also cannot be
528000	540000	something like autonomy, free will or agency, objects cannot decide how they will react, they just are passively subjected to these forces.
540000	556000	So there the logical structure is consistent, we have all these objects subjected to forces, we can explain lots of things in terms of objects and particles, but then there is one thing which we clearly cannot explain.
556000	573000	Namely, if we assume that there are human observers who are looking at those objects and doing things with those objects, then we need to assume that these humans have something that the objects don't have, namely that these humans have agency that they are autonomous free
573000	589000	who can decide, consciously decide what they are going to do, so the brick may be subjective passively to the force of gravity, but I as a human can decide whether or not I will throw the brick or put the brick here or there.
589000	607000	So then we get that, that was the solution of the cat to that problem that humans must have something else, something that is not that matter, they must have some kind of a substance that he called mind, which led to the philosophy of mind,
607000	624000	whether dualism or mind body dualism, there is the mind which is something not material, and then there are the material objects, but immediately that creates a problem which is known as the mind body problem, if we assume that the body is material.
624000	645000	The material particles in the body are subjected to deterministic forces, while the mind has a free will and can interact with the body, then how can that be, it's a contradiction, either the matter is subjected to deterministic forces, or it's subjected to the free will of the mind it
645000	655000	is not about, so we have a problem there which is an unsolvable paradox that lots of philosophers have been lamented about.
655000	671000	So, for me, this paradox the only way to solve this is that you really need a different ontology, you should not make the distinction between passive objects, and active, a gentle minds that nobody understands quite what they are.
671000	678000	And that brings me to a different ontology that is also pretty old, that is the process ontology.
678000	688000	The process ontology against primal illness, we said that change is an illusion, process ontology on the contrary says change is the most basic thing.
688000	709000	The reality is not constituted out of static object, but out of things that change out of processes. And that is an old philosophy, it actually dates from before the Socratic philosophers before Pyramidus, and the best representative in Greek philosophy is Heraclitus,
709000	725000	who is famous with his statement that you can never step in the same river twice, a river is not a thing, it's not an object, a river is a flow, every time you step into the river, it's a different water that you're stepping in, but there is still this river.
725000	738000	And we see similar philosophies in Eastern philosophy, for example in Taoism, where you have this idea of the Tao as a kind of a flow that describes reality.
739000	757000	These ideas have been picked up in 20th century philosophy by a number of philosophers like Whitehead, ThÃ©Ã¢tre de Chardin and Bergson, but they have never really made much impact on science and I will later explain why that is.
757000	767000	So, rather than immediately going into this abstract process philosophy, I first want to come back to something that's even earlier than the Socratic philosophers.
767000	786000	And that is animism, animism is not an official philosophy, it's a way of describing how hunter-gatherers look at the world, it's a concept that was produced by anthropologists who were studying hunter-gatherers and who noticed that they tended to see
786000	794000	all the phenomena around them, the plants, the animals, the trees, the clouds, the rivers as animated.
794000	815000	That means they saw them as agents, not as passive objects, but as agents that have some spirit of their own and therefore the hunter-gatherers live, you might say, in harmony with nature in the sense that they see themselves as being imaged in this network of relationships.
815000	819000	They have relationships with all these natural agents.
819000	842000	Now, there are different attitudes towards animism and the traditional view in anthropology is that while animism is just some very primitive, naive view, a pre-scientific view where people attribute supernatural characteristics to these material objects.
842000	855000	They kind of tend to think that there is some kind of a spirit living in the tree and it's all very naive, it's just a projection of the internal theory of mind on those external things.
855000	873000	But since recently, since about 20 years, there's a new view developing in anthropology by anthropologists such as Noyd, Burt, David, Tim Ingold and Gavin Gehm-Harvey, who look at animism in a much more pragmatic manner.
873000	881000	That's to say, for them, animism is a natural way of adapting to the ecosystem in which you live.
881000	900000	That means understanding the ecosystem as indeed a network of agents and in which you as a human are just one of the agents among many, and you try to form good positive relationship with those agents.
900000	912000	And this is kind of a little bit of a symbolic depiction of animism. It's the idea that the tree is not just a piece of wood, but it has some kind of a spirit.
912000	929000	But we need to understand spirit here as that what animates it, not so much as some supernatural soul-like entity, the way it is depicted in dualistic philosophies, where there is the mind of the tree and there is the material of the tree,
929000	944000	where the two are separable, that dualism isn't there in animism. The spirit of the tree is in the tree, it's not something that you can take out of it and that you can see in some kind of a supernatural realm.
944000	957000	If animism is indeed this kind of very natural, intuitive way of relating to the world, then a good question to ask is, why are we no longer animists?
957000	973000	And many people nowadays, especially with ecological movement, have kind of lamented that we have lost our connection with nature, that people no longer have this kind of intuitive empathy with trees and with clouds and with rivers.
973000	999000	And that affects a lot of our modern problems of scarcity, exhaustion, pollution, can be explained by that because we treat nature no longer as a collection of agents with whom we are interrelated, we are treating it just as a bunch of raw materials of objects that are just there to be consumed and to be transformed whatever way we see fit.
999000	1019000	Now I have discovered an extremely interesting author who is not that well known, that's why I want to emphasize that it's worth reading him, who is called David Abram, who is an anthropologist who has done some field studies in different countries.
1019000	1041000	Yeah, he's not a very traditional scientific anthropologist, he's more kind of what you might call an eco-philosophy, that means he tries to get into the mindset of these people he has been observing and he himself tries to recreate that kind of animistic consciousness.
1041000	1056000	He has published two books that are both written, which I made lots of different markings so that it gives you kind of a sign of how much they inspired me, and the titles kind of speak for themselves.
1056000	1071000	This first book is The Spell of the Sun, so he speaks about this sensuous, this embodied sensation of being in the world in nature and participating, feeling the wind, feeling the trees, hearing the birds.
1071000	1090000	And the other one he calls an becoming animal, yeah, it's recovering this sensitivity that animals have where animals walk to the woods and they will notice the slightest changes and noises that we westerners when we walk to the woods we will just ignore.
1091000	1103000	Now what's also interesting about Abram is that not only he gives you a sense of what this original animistic consciousness was, but he also has a hypothesis of why we lost that.
1103000	1128000	So his hypothesis, I'm not sure it explains everything but it's definitely words looking at is that we lost this consciousness when the invention of alphabetic writing, something that we get from the Hebrews and the Greeks and why is that by writing what you do is you describe something with a word but the word is disconnected from the thing.
1128000	1140000	The word just stays there, it's in a book, it goes into a library, it loses completely the connection with the context and a word by definition is something static.
1140000	1150000	Words do not change when you open your book it's still the same words in there, while the tree that the word refers to the tree will have changed in the meantime.
1150000	1170000	His idea is that when Plato started thinking in terms of essences, Plato was one of the first philosophers who was really using littered material was really using texts, that Plato kind of had this idea of eternal forms essences by looking at words.
1170000	1186000	And then when you go further and you start expressing these things not only in words but in mathematical formulas and you completely cut out the context, which means you make kind of a static abstract representation of it that is unchanging.
1186000	1205000	Now another aspect that is definitely very important also is that since Plato and even more since the hunter gathers, we are living in an artificial environment that means an environment mostly consists of artifacts, artifacts like cups and cups are passive objects.
1205000	1224000	There is nothing animated or a gentle in a cup, while in a piece of wood, you may say okay it's just a piece of wood, but if you come back two months later that piece of wood may have been eaten by alz or it may have eroded or it may have changed color.
1224000	1238000	There are differences between natural materials that are constantly adapting to circumstances and things like cups and all kind of artifacts. And if you look at this room here, there's nothing animated in here except people.
1238000	1254000	This dualistic worldview, it's logical that we make a distinction between material objects that are just passive like this, this table and animated people, which are all the rest, and there's nothing in between.
1254000	1262000	But if you look outside the window then you see the trees and then you see other things except objects and people.
1262000	1281000	So, I'm not the only person and Abraham is not the only person who has been thinking in this direction, and I might even say that there is a tendency now in science and philosophy to have a certain innocence of animism.
1281000	1295000	I will first look at the domain that I know best, the scientific models of agency and what is now very common are so called agent based models, what's an agent based model.
1295000	1319000	The computer simulation of some complex system could be a market could be a society could be an ecosystem. And you do that by defining agents where agents are entities that follow certain rules, and they interact with each other and with the environment to these rules.
1319000	1334000	The dimensions of course are abstractions, but because each agent acts on its own, and then interacts with the other. What you see is that the whole tends to develop very complex dynamics.
1334000	1345000	And then we come into the domain that has been called complex adaptive systems you see that these networks of agents start to self organize, and they develop all kind of emergent properties.
1345000	1364000	And this is an attempt that has been going on I would say at least for 30 years in the physical sciences in the computer sciences, but also in the social sciences and the humanities there is a certain revival of this, what I would call animistics spirit.
1364000	1381000	Also, there we see models of agents in networks and probably the most famous one is the actor network theory that was developed among others by the sociologist Bruno Latour, and I don't remember his first name Albert Cuyol.
1381000	1393000	What they do is they analyze complex social evolution as an interplay between many different what they call actors, but the actors are not just humans.
1393000	1400000	The actors can be institutions they can be technologies they can be even physical resources like uranium.
1400000	1413000	All of these are actors in the sense that their actions will have an effect on how this network develops, and what is coming out of it.
1413000	1424000	And this is not really my specialty but he has been here in the audience has worked on that the idea of the parliament of things.
1424000	1444000	There is not reason in that thing. In this reason you start to say well all these non human actors, maybe they also have some say maybe they should, we should give them some rights, and they have for example be attempts to give legal rights to rivers that has been a case like that that I know in New Zealand.
1444000	1464000	And that's one part of the influences of this new paradigm. And then there is a paradigm more in the humanities and in the so called cultural and critical studies that is called post humanism, which some of the authors are the famous Donna Haraway and Karen Barrett.
1464000	1478000	And here the idea that humanism puts humans central is the old idea of the cat, you have the humans that are rational, and that have this mind, and they are different from everything else.
1478000	1483000	They're different from the animals they're different from technologies, they are unique.
1483000	1498000	So post humanism says we should no longer take humans as the central part of everything humans are just one among many, and the border, the bond is between what is human and what is not human are often fuzzy.
1498000	1508000	And I think, for example, at technologies that support us, we become like cyborgs. And also if you think about symbiosis between humans and animals.
1508000	1525000	We can't just say that the human is a separate individual. So, what you need to do is to blur these boundaries between humans and the rest of the world and see humans as just one among many agents that are all living symbiotically.
1526000	1539000	So, all these movements they're going in the same direction but at the moment, you can't say that there is a really an integrated theory.
1539000	1554000	Each of these have different terminologies have different concept they have different assumptions they come from different traditions, like for example very simple idea that you speak about agents in the one and you speak about actors in the other.
1554000	1559000	You speak about individuals.
1559000	1573000	Obviously, there is a lot of incoherence still. So, what I'm trying to propose here is to unify the different approaches by developing a common ontology.
1573000	1580000	So we said that an ontology is a set of building blocks conceptual building blocks.
1580000	1597000	And we don't want to lose the ability of science to make mathematical models so we should ideally have buildings books conceptual building books that can also be formalize at least can be put into mathematical formulas that can be used for computer simulation.
1597000	1608000	So that is why I propose my new ontology which I call relational agency, and which is an extension of the process ontology.
1608000	1628000	Why do we need an extension of the process ontology. Well, if we look at the process metaphysics in the work of people like Whitehead and Berg so we see lots of inspiring ideas but we don't see very clearly, concretely applicable things.
1628000	1635000	These existing theories, they tend to be quite obscure, complicated, fake abstract.
1635000	1654000	They're also not, they also don't have a very clear definition, they say that everything is a process but then what is the process, then typical examples are kind of a process of evolution or process of development but these are incredibly complex processes where you can't really say where they begin or answer.
1654000	1670000	It's very difficult to model. So that is, I think why this process philosophies have not yet had much impact in science, because you can't, you don't know very well how to implement them, how to model them, how to analyze them.
1670000	1683000	And I propose an instance of starting from guns processes without borders. Let's start from the equivalent of elementary particles that we will call this elementary processes.
1683000	1688000	And these processes is elementary processes I call reactions.
1688000	1700000	These are our building blocks, and then when we need to go to more complex things and we will just build up more complex things as networks of such reactions.
1700000	1707000	So, a little bit for the people maybe with a background in physics.
1707000	1716000	When you go to quantum to you you see that actually these kind of elementary processes of these elementary actions are really the basis of everything.
1716000	1729000	So already the traditional quantum mechanics tells you that particles are not objects, the way we imagine them. They don't have essential properties that just are there.
1729000	1738000	Properties of particles, you, they get their properties to observations and what's an observation, it's an interaction.
1738000	1754000	And do not interact or do not act in quantum mechanics, they don't really have properties they don't even have a position in space in quantum mechanics you can't say that an electron is located in a particular position, it's only after you make an observation
1754000	1762000	you can't say, ah, it's there. But the moment after the observation, it has again diffuse and it's no longer there.
1762000	1771000	So that's already quantum mechanics we tells you that the properties of objects are not stable they're not permanent they're not absolute.
1771000	1786000	But the quantum field theory you come to the conclusion that even the objects themselves are not stable because particles are merely instantiations of fields and fields are descriptions of potential interactions.
1786000	1794000	The particles in quantum field theory, they are being destroyed by being created, they're being transformed.
1794000	1806000	So, if people need convincing that elementary processes are more fundamental than particles, I think quantum filter is the good reason.
1806000	1821000	Because quantum filter is the most fundamental theory we have in physics, and it's also the most accurate one because there are attempts to make more fundamental theories like string theory but these theories simply don't make any predictions whatsoever.
1821000	1828000	Or quantum filter makes very precise prediction that turned out to be very precisely correct.
1828000	1840000	So by defining these elementary reactions and this elementary reactions, I will use a formalism that is so simple that really, I mean a child could learn it.
1840000	1849000	So I want to have a formalism or language which is transdisciplinary can be applied to all possible cases.
1849000	1866000	So some of my languages of my language are what I call conditions, sometimes they also use other names like components or molecules, and the reactions that change conditions so what is the condition a condition is something that you can distinguish.
1866000	1876000	A condition could be its light or its dark and a reaction then is something that changes that condition.
1876000	1881000	You can see here the reaction.
1881000	1888000	L a that means something brings a into existence a appears.
1888000	1895000	I could, for example, say, I'm in the dark, and suddenly there is light a appears.
1895000	1904000	It's kind of like the simplest possible process you could imagine something distinguishable emerges appears.
1904000	1918000	So if something appears you can also disappear. That's the second case here a followed by an arrow a goes into emptiness a disappears if there was light and suddenly the light is switched off then the light is gone.
1918000	1925000	Of course that's not very interesting if you want to describe networks, you will need to have some relations between conditions.
1925000	1936000	So the next simplest reaction is a leads to be, which means I start in condition a and I go to condition be.
1936000	1950000	Maybe I go to form a situation where there is a little bit of light and then I go to a situation with a lot of light or maybe I go from a situation where there is yellow light and then the light changes into blue.
1950000	1955000	It's all very simple to get to the full power of the formalism.
1955000	1975000	You need to do to use a notation that is used in chemistry and in physics to describe elementary actions that is the A plus big if C plus the A plus B means a and B are both there, a conjunction of a and B, there are two conditions.
1975000	1993000	If these two conditions are there at the same time, then some other conditions will appear, for example, a leads to be could be the condition is dark clouds are gathering the process is, it starts raining.
1993000	2004000	So if I have two conditions if I have dark clouds are gathering and people are in the street, then it starts to rain and people will seek shelter.
2004000	2009000	So the process are just saying that you have two conditions.
2009000	2020000	And this level of formalism already allows me to define elementary agent, an agent is something that makes a process happen.
2020000	2032000	So the agent is the one that performs an action if you wish, that means that makes the process happen, and I can describe it here in this formalism I use see as an agent.
2032000	2039000	So A plus C turns into B plus C, that means the C still is there.
2039000	2060000	But the A is transformed into B, the C is a necessary condition to turn the A into a B, so C enables the reaction in the language of chemistry, C is a catalyst, a catalyst in chemistry is a molecule that makes a reaction happen, but that is not itself affected by the reaction.
2060000	2075000	So this catalyst C can be seen as the agent turning a into B, and the reaction that it performs can be interpreted as what in artificial intelligence is sometimes called a condition action rule.
2075000	2089000	That means the agent is sensitive to particular condition namely sensitive to the condition a, and when it never it is confronted with condition a, it will perform an action that turns this a into B.
2089000	2105000	So one agent can catalyze a reaction turning a into B, but it would also turn C into F, E into F, F and G together into H, B into E.
2105000	2115000	So generally an agent will catalyze different reaction that means an agent can perform different actions, and which action it will perform will depend on the initial conditions.
2115000	2131000	So if there is A, the agent will produce B, if there is B, the agent will produce E, if there is E, the agent will produce F, if there is F and there is also G, then the agent will produce H.
2131000	2149000	Agents have these kind of properties. It's particles, molecules are agents in that sense. Agents will react with certain things, and depending on what kind of agent it is, it will perform certain reactions and not others.
2149000	2168000	So agents have this kind of identity of being able to perform certain actions. Now, if you take all the reactions that an agent can perform together, they form what they form what in physics or mathematics is called a dynamical system.
2168000	2182000	The dynamical system is the equivalence of a force that means something that pushes things in a particular direction. It takes the A's turns them into B's, it takes the B's turns them into E's etc.
2182000	2188000	So it is pushing things. A dynamical system is something that pushes things in a certain direction.
2188000	2201000	Since we know that dynamical systems typically have attractors, that means that they push things into a region, but they don't push them out of that region, so they kind of accumulate in this attractor region.
2201000	2215000	And we can interpret that very simply that attractor is like the agent goal. The goal of the agent is to move whatever is there into this region.
2215000	2234000	Now, catalyst agent in that sense they play a little bit the role of the objects or the forces in the old ontology objects in the sense that they don't change during the reactions forces in the sense that they have an effect on the things they react with, but
2234000	2241000	they're not assumed to be eternal. They're not assumed to have these essential properties that remain forever.
2241000	2251000	Agents are just conditions like all the others which mean that there are certain reactions that destroy agents that consume agents that build agents.
2251000	2267000	Agents can play the role of objects and forces in the old ontology but they have this inbuilt dynamism they can change into something else they are not given you don't need to make this assumption that objects always need to be there.
2267000	2279000	Now if you reason in terms of natural selection you see this network of all kinds of reactions and reactions are constantly turning things into other things.
2280000	2290000	What remains after a while well all these things that are turned into other things are no longer there, but some things are not being turned into other things.
2290000	2299000	And so after a while, the ones that will remain are the ones where the available reactions are not turning them into other things.
2299000	2305000	So, the existence of things like stable particles.
2305000	2319000	So that's an effect of natural selection. In elementary particle physics you have lots, you have a zoo of hundreds of different particles and most of these particles are very unstable.
2319000	2328000	That mean they react with some other particle turning to two new particles which in turn fall apart or turn into new particles.
2328000	2334000	But from time to time you could produce a very stable particle like a proton.
2334000	2347000	And then, yeah, then the whole universe gets filled up with protons and gets filled up with neutrons, and these protons and neutrons from atoms and these atoms are also quite stable.
2347000	2362000	You just let the reaction soon after a while you stick typically with the most stable was there's a natural selection of the most stable one that explains why even though the world is at core a big process.
2362000	2371000	This process tends to produce locally stable entities that we call elementary agents.
2371000	2390000	In elementary agents like stable particles, they're not very interesting. When we think about agency more in the style of human agency we're thinking about something that we make all auto poetic agent so an auto poetic agent for music kind of a generalization of a living agent,
2390000	2405000	a living organism. Now what's the difference between a living agent and one of these physical agents like particles that is that a living agent is constituted out of processes.
2405000	2418000	The processes are going on. It's not a stable particle. It's particles that are being transformed into other particles are being transformed into other particles, but the whole is stable.
2418000	2432000	And here I have kind of thought of the simplest possible instantiation of such an auto poetic agent is an a turns into a B and a B turns into an a so they are forming each other.
2432000	2444000	And typically because there is always some losses because of thermodynamics some of the bees get lost some of the bees disappear and to replenish that you need to have some input of ace.
2444000	2451000	So, if you imagine this cycle a B as a simple living system.
2451000	2461000	The incoming ace is the food and the outgoing bees is the waste, but the two are constantly rebuilding each other.
2461000	2466000	Now, this is of course an extremely simple cycle.
2466000	2479000	To make it more realistic, you will need a bit of more sophisticated mathematics and the mathematics here that turns out to be extremely useful is called chemical organization theory.
2479000	2489000	This is because the inspirations come from chemical reactions but actually does not speak specifically about chemistry it speaks about all kind of reactions.
2489000	2502000	And it is a very simple and elegant mathematical model of these kind of auto poetic system that means system that are producing themselves that are in a constant flow of self maintenance.
2502000	2518000	The definition of an organization or a chemical organization is a set of components or conditions and the actions that is has two properties close that means the reactions working on the components produced new components.
2518000	2529000	But after a while the new components are the same component that were already there so the system is close in the sense that it's only producing things that are already there.
2529000	2537000	And it's also self maintaining that means that whatever is consumed by reaction must be produced again.
2537000	2543000	So whatever disappears appears again, and nothing new is added.
2543000	2552000	So, an organization is something that reproduces all its components, it keeps the process alive.
2553000	2561000	Just to give you a little bit of a graphical depiction, this is a bit of a more complex organization and the one I had.
2561000	2566000	The triangles here are the reactions are three.
2566000	2572000	The letters here are the components that are being consumed and transformed.
2572000	2575000	I'm not going to go into any details here.
2575000	2588000	I want to give you a much more intuitive example. And this is a very nice kind of thing that you can actually buy over the weapon I'm considering buying what it's called an eco sphere.
2588000	2597000	It is an aquarium that is completely closed so it's a glass sphere where nothing enters except light.
2597000	2603000	No air that can escape, there is no water that goes in or goes out.
2603000	2610000	And in that eco sphere there are a number of organisms that stay alive and the organism we will look at here are the shrimps.
2610000	2621000	You see these little red things are shrimps, the green things are algae, and then the third one which you can't see because they are too small bacteria.
2621000	2629000	And how come that these things can stay alive in a completely closed atmosphere.
2629000	2644000	That is because they have reactions that are self maintaining they form an auto poetic system. This is a kind of an ecosystem at a very small scale that is producing itself and what is the production.
2644000	2650000	You have an input of light because the plants need energy to go.
2650000	2662000	So, then you will have the shrimps that will consume the algae and also consume the oxygen that's there.
2662000	2671000	And they do that basically to survive so the shrimps don't change in the process, but they produce waste.
2671000	2676000	They have carbon dioxide, and they produce a little bit of heat.
2676000	2683000	So if they would just be shrimps, well after a while all the algae would be eaten, all the oxygen would be taken up.
2683000	2689000	There would be an accumulation of waste and CO2, the shrimps would die, the whole thing would stop.
2689000	2701000	But at least for the waste, we see the bacteria will take the waste and they will also use a little bit of oxygen and they change these waste into nutrients.
2701000	2711000	They also produce a little bit of carbon dioxide so if they would be just shrimps and bacteria, the system would also not be able to survive.
2711000	2725000	But then we see that the algae, when they get light as an input, they can turn the CO2 and the nutrients which were produced by the bacteria into more algae.
2725000	2738000	So the algae multiply themselves through this process and because there are now more algae, the shrimps can again eat the additional algae and the whole cycle starts anew.
2738000	2746000	So what you see here is that the system is self-maintaining and at the same time it's a process, so it's a self-maintaining process.
2746000	2754000	Everything changes, everything is being consumed, everything is being produced, but the whole survives.
2754000	2762000	Now this is a commercial thing that you can buy in a shop, but you can also make one yourself and I have already done that.
2762000	2781000	So what do you do? You take a big glass jar, you go to a pond, you collect all kinds of things from the pond, a little bit of dirty water, some mud, some plants, some animals typically will be snails, insects, maybe tadpoles, some worms.
2781000	2796000	You put it all together and then you see what happens and well, initially it may not go very well, I'm pretty sure that some of your organisms will die because they are not adapted to this particular ecosystem.
2796000	2810000	But after a while, you see that it comes to some equilibrium, that means there will be some species that will survive and it will go, so there will be fit, that means there will be adapted to this closed ecosystem.
2810000	2822000	And it is a dynamical system that means things go up and down, there will be fluctuations, sometimes there will be more algae and sometimes there will be more snails.
2822000	2833000	But if there are more algae and not enough snails, then the snails will have more to eat, they will eat more of the algae, so the number of algae will diminish, the number of snails will increase.
2833000	2841000	If there are too many snails, there would not be enough algae left to feed all the snails, so some of the snails will die.
2841000	2856000	So there will be kind of a negative feedback that whenever some species grows too much, the feedback will be that it again diminishes or vice versa, whenever one diminishes, there will be a feedback so that in the next state it will again grow.
2856000	2861000	So these systems tend to self-organize.
2861000	2869000	Now we can use the same principle by zooming out to the very large scale, namely the scale of the whole planet.
2869000	2878000	And if we look at the whole planet, the whole planet is kind of like an ecosphere, it is a closed system.
2878000	2888000	The only thing that enters is light from the sun, the only thing that goes off is heat that is radiated in space, but all this is in the planet.
2888000	2894000	And yeah, it has adapted the planet as a whole is stable.
2894000	2904000	Of course there are fluctuations, there are occasional darts, there are sometimes species that get extinguished, there are sometimes new species that arise.
2904000	2909000	But as a whole, the system is stable, is self-maintaining.
2909000	2925000	And if you would write down the reactions, you will see that the reactions are actually the way I wrote them down are almost the same as the actions with the shrimps, except that now I have replaced shrimps, specifically by animals in general.
2925000	2938000	I have replaced algae specifically by plants in general. I have replaced bacteria specifically by decomposes all these kinds of animals, bacteria and other decompose organic stuff.
2938000	2947000	And basically the same system, it just at a much larger scale, much more complex.
2947000	2952000	So what you see in there, yes?
2978000	3001000	So I was wondering if we can make it a little bit more abstract, thinking that the role of what an animal is for us is not the same role that it plays there, because even ways could turn to be as animal as the animal in this view.
3001000	3006000	So what you see at the point?
3006000	3012000	In this particular model.
3012000	3027000	In this particular model, the animals are agents because animals appear both in the beginning and in the input and in the output of the reaction, while the waste is not.
3027000	3036000	I'm going to show that if you would make a more detailed model at some level, waste may be an agent as well.
3036000	3048000	So the agent in my definition is the one that participates in the action without being consumed by that reaction. So in this case, the animals are agents, the plants are agents.
3048000	3056000	Not because the waste is just for the for the oxygen is just being consumed and produced. It does not stay.
3056000	3078000	I mean, that since you were doing examples of different spatial, time spatial levels, or less the same structure is kept. So that doesn't cause my attention that then the dynamical growth in the process, being an agent for being playing the role of what we understand normally its waste,
3078000	3085000	would be more like a process forward than a way of being an object.
3085000	3090000	So it's going to be more abstract.
3090000	3103000	Yeah, like, like, we are the ways of another process, besides being an agent we are and that relates to what you never think you were saying.
3103000	3119000	It's a good question that I'm wondering whether there is a fundamental distinction, always between agents and the other side sometimes costs resources resources are things that are being transformed into other resources.
3119000	3130000	While agents are the ones that perform the transformation but are not themselves affected by the transformation. Don't the other agents also will be transformed by other agents.
3130000	3139000	But they, it could be that there are resources are just resources that do not do anything active. I don't know.
3139000	3151000	Yeah, I have a question. So considering that like an idea can exist before the reaction and exist after the reaction. So can an idea also be an agent. Yes.
3151000	3158000	And so, and so also then an archetype can be an agent.
3158000	3163000	It's like a kind of governing idea for culture that persists through time.
3163000	3167000	And that could be there.
3167000	3174000	The first thing should persist during the reaction and it should be necessary for the reaction.
3174000	3188000	So if certain things would only happen if the architect is there and the architect itself is not affected, then you would say that the architect is the agent of that process.
3189000	3197000	Basically, yeah. So like for a religious culture like the ultimate agent, we got to be the most persistent.
3197000	3207000	Except that gods have not always existed that people at some moment invented gotten at other moments have forgotten God. So, yeah.
3207000	3218000	All they know agents are immortal and I D agents, I think they're very strongly culture dependent. So they come and they go.
3218000	3220000	But yes, they are agents.
3220000	3228000	But are you not making a distinction between like individual people in general, because because people show we persisted for 10,000 years.
3228000	3233000	But individual human beings don't persist.
3233000	3235000	Yeah, yeah.
3235000	3239000	It's that important that it's like, is there a difference between like an individual and for.
3239000	3252000	Yes, in my paper, I have an agent and an agency where the agency is the more general but also distributed agents.
3252000	3260000	I would imply that you have to enter some property to say that they are agents that are localized by humans.
3260000	3265000	There are agencies that are distributed such as legends.
3265000	3273000	On the other hand, the agency is still localized in the sense that it's on this planet.
3273000	3279000	I'm not yet out of this of how to make a distinction in a short way.
3279000	3291000	And why do you choose like a specialist and like goes back and over and it's like autonomy where it's something that can create itself during the time.
3291000	3294000	It's like an overview. So why do you.
3294000	3303000	No, no, the so the so the self producing things are agents agents of a more of a more sophisticated.
3303000	3308000	Yeah, but why do you store agencies for something like that?
3308000	3311000	It's like no you're not.
3311000	3324000	No, precisely because I want to get rid of the dualism which says that you have the passive object like things and then you have the active agent like things that have a mind.
3324000	3332000	What I claim is that the difference between the two is much as big.
3332000	3337000	Well, there's a difference, but there's a different between all the poetic.
3337000	3344000	I make a different between all the poetic agents and what I might call stable or rigid agents.
3344000	3355000	I think that in many cases, you may look at an agent as stable or rigid at one level of of granularity.
3355000	3360000	But if then you look at it at the deeper level, you will see that actually it is a process.
3360000	3374000	It's, I think even this cup, if you would look at the level of quantum fields in between the atoms of this cup, you might find that actually it's some kind of an auto poetic agent.
3374000	3384000	There are models of quantum fields that say that a bolt between atoms is actually a continuous exchange of virtual photons.
3384000	3396000	So maybe what these things that we consider a static agents, maybe they are really auto poetic but at the level where we would never consider them.
3396000	3399000	Yes.
3399000	3408000	I'm very new to this, so this might be a very strange question, but I tried to understand what is new and what I'm seeing.
3408000	3425000	When you were setting it up, I was like, desiring and anticipating on a model which process seems to be central and the idea of entity would have disappeared.
3425000	3437000	And when I see this described, I try to wrap my head around like I see actually entities that do processes with each other.
3437000	3443000	So what is new and chemistry?
3443000	3446000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have a good question.
3446000	3454000	That is why it's, I mean, intuitively we see these things as entities, but that is why I started by calling them conditions.
3454000	3457000	A condition is something that you can distinguish.
3457000	3463000	And condition is something you can distinguish and distinction by the finishes for any process.
3463000	3475000	So the distinction is in a sense the most basic elements, and you can distinguish something and in our nervous system basically our brain can only distinguish things that change in some way.
3475000	3479000	Things that do not change, you can't really distinguish.
3479000	3486000	The implicit in the notion of distinguishable is already that it appears at a certain moment, but it's not always there.
3486000	3497000	The typical examples of conditions are CO2, so we tend to think of CO2 as an entity, but CO2 an entity.
3497000	3512000	It's a particular state of atoms of carbon and oxygen that is sometimes formed and then again dissolved and the CO2 that's now in the atmosphere will not be the same CO2 that is tomorrow in the atmosphere.
3512000	3524000	So it's a short-term and we tend to use this short-term and to re-refine and to turn them into entities, but actually there are distinctions.
3524000	3534000	And then the question is which distinctions are stable and the whole process, the whole idea is if you make a network of reactions you can start to see which things are more stable, which things are less stable.
3534000	3543000	Nothing is absolutely stable. All of them are changes. The basis is changed.
3543000	3548000	It's a concept that it's young.
3548000	3553000	I have two questions.
3553000	3558000	One question.
3558000	3566000	The second one, I don't know if you will elaborate later on.
3566000	3573000	I was thinking about luck. How can luck be defined in this relational agency?
3573000	3595000	What is a lucky agent? If I was an agent in this worldview that we're defining, how does a lot of randomness and spontaneity and all this can be defined with this model?
3595000	3607000	Yeah, that is also a good question. The way I discovered the reactions at the moment, they look deterministic, but you don't need to make the assumption that there is deterministic.
3607000	3620000	You could, for example, have two reactions.
3620000	3626000	Two reactions, A turns into B and B turns into C.
3626000	3637000	There are different ways to interpret that. You could say part of A turns into B, part of A turns into C, or you could say A needs to make a choice in the final turning to B or it turns into C.
3637000	3651000	If you think statistically as A being a concentration of particles of type A, then maybe you can say 75% of the A is turning to B, 25% of the A is turning to C.
3651000	3660000	But if A is a single particle, it cannot both turn into B and to C, sometimes it turns into B, sometimes it turns into C.
3660000	3676000	If you're getting one in field theory, you have possible reactions, but it's intrinsically indeterministic. You can calculate probabilities generally, but there's typically more than one reaction possible.
3676000	3687000	And statistically, then you can say 75% of A is turning to B, but an individual reaction is one.
3687000	3702000	Is there a way to talk about this using like sticking more closely to the kind of like the language process and relationships rather than talking about particles?
3702000	3711000	Because even though I know you're trying to talk about process, when we keep using these language of particles, it keeps sounding like the old language.
3711000	3716000	No, I know, but if I wouldn't use that language, most people probably would see the other stuff that I'm talking about.
3716000	3723000	But I would be very curious to know what that language sounds like. And I think it's also partly like that our language isn't set up for...
3723000	3724000	Yeah, no, no.
3724000	3731000	I think the best term up to now that I found is conditions.
3731000	3739000	So A is a distinguishable condition, but the distinguishable condition is another distinguishable condition.
3739000	3748000	So, I need to describe that very good term.
3748000	3758000	I'm angry, and then somebody tells me a joke and suddenly I get very happy.
3758000	3762000	So A was angry, and B was happy.
3762000	3764000	So A turned into B.
3764000	3767000	Not a particle, it's not a thing.
3767000	3774000	My anger turned into happiness, but anger is not a thing, it's a state, it's a condition.
3774000	3777000	Which you can make sure that that's the point.
3777000	3781000	I think that's the same thing that is necessarily...
3781000	3792000	More fundamental in my ontology, which I haven't discussed at this moment because I wanted to put the end of this on a higher level agency,
3792000	3795000	is the difference that makes a difference.
3795000	3800000	Something is distinguishable if it's a difference that makes a difference.
3800000	3807000	And making a difference means that if I have an A that doesn't react in anything that A doesn't exist,
3807000	3813000	or A could make any sense, there should be at least some reaction where it turned into B
3813000	3816000	and some reaction that produces an A.
3816000	3820000	If the difference doesn't make a difference, then it doesn't make this.
3820000	3824000	So everything is only defined by its reactions.
3824000	3830000	And that is, at the most fundamental level, I call it a good stuff in axiom.
3830000	3835000	The things get the meaning by their relations with others.
3835000	3840000	Nothing exists on its own. A on its own doesn't have any meaning.
3840000	3844000	It only gets a meaning by participating in these reactions.
3844000	3851000	How is the difference from the empirical maximum of science, like if we cannot observe it, then it doesn't exist?
3851000	3855000	It's a metaphysical view of this.
3855000	3861000	Another version is the life and its principle of the identity of the distinguishable.
3861000	3870000	There isn't any way in which I can say that A leads to B and A5 leads to B, but I don't know.
3870000	3879000	If I say that all A5 leads to B, and there isn't any reaction in which A and A5 have different reactions.
3879000	3883000	When I say A5, they're the same.
3883000	3885000	There is no difference. It makes a difference.
3885000	3888000	Therefore, A and A5 are one and the same thing.
3888000	3892000	If they participate in exactly the same reaction, they are the same thing.
3892000	3898000	And that is a problem that many people in philosophy do not understand.
3898000	3905000	They kind of tend to assume that the example I always give is the health problem of consciousness.
3905000	3908000	You probably have all heard about the famous zombie problem.
3908000	3916000	So you imagine that there is a zombie and the zombie behaves exactly like a normal person, but the zombie does not have consciousness.
3916000	3925000	For me, a zombie must be a real person, because if there is no way in which you can distinguish a zombie from a person, there is no difference.
3925000	3935000	And then all people have consciousness, or all people are zombies, but there is no sense in postulating something that is indistinguishable.
3935000	3942000	So things exist because they have relationships with other things, which in turn have relationships with other things.
3942000	3945000	That is why it's good, something that is no bottom level.
3945000	3948000	I will not start from elementary particles.
3948000	3952000	These particles exist, and everything else is reduced.
3952000	3961000	And I know I say there is this network of reactions, and whenever something appears in the network of reactions, it's there only because of the network of reactions.
3961000	3964000	If there is a network of reactions, then it doesn't exist.
3964000	3965000	Sorry.
3965000	3971000	Being able to distinguish a zombie, we can pass through different things yet to the market.
3971000	3977000	So how do you know that you didn't skip one kind of every end?
3977000	3980000	Yeah, that can happen, and that's how we learn.
3980000	3983000	You can't conclude that some of them are the same then.
3983000	3995000	No, no, the thought experiment of Thomas about the zombies is that he says explicitly that is not where you can explain it.
3995000	4003000	If you state that as an assumption, then you create a meaningless thought experiment.
4003000	4007000	But I wonder if I have some kind of intuition.
4008000	4020000	Even by replacing things by relationships, it's like going back to this, trying to start from this idea of elementary relationships.
4020000	4025000	Yeah, I'm not sure if it's really like a solution to kind of productionism or not.
4025000	4028000	Maybe it's just productionism by another name.
4028000	4038000	It's like, it's still this idea that you can come back to something elementary, some basic building block that you can then put together to explain the world.
4038000	4043000	There's another aspect about this form of this.
4043000	4065000	It can be anything as big or small as small, it can be being angry, it can be being happy, it can be the world having a COVID epidemic versus the COVID epidemic being finished.
4065000	4076000	Nothing says how big or how small this case is. The only thing is this is the distinguishable condition that leads to a different distinguishable condition.
4076000	4086000	So it's elementary in notation, it's not elementary in the sense of what it represents, it does not claim that what it represents is something elementary.
4086000	4094000	I can use this formula to speak about COVID and COVID is something extremely complicated.
4095000	4107000	But, and couldn't it be that a way to express the relational agency model is to express that objects and subjects can switch position?
4107000	4116000	Because if you can show that sometimes an animal is eaten, sometimes he gets eaten, so sometimes he's a subject, sometimes the object.
4116000	4126000	This kind of illustrates the relational agency idea more than just summing up reactions, you know what I mean?
4126000	4144000	You certainly have the two types of reactions, you have the reaction, human was called as human, the human eats the cow, was wasted.
4144000	4157000	The cow is being eaten, and then you have the cow was lost, the cow was wasted, and the cow is the agent.
4157000	4165000	So they are interested in the cow becoming a subject and human object in the same reaction.
4165000	4180000	There's an example of when you try to transfer potatoes in the garden, you think you're the subject and the potato is the object because you choose the potato, but actually you can say that the potato breed chose you because he seduced you to choose him.
4180000	4185000	So he actually is also the subject and you're the object listening to the potato. You see what I mean?
4186000	4190000	There's no problem, no problem.
4190000	4195000	There's two types after that.
4195000	4203000	There are two humans.
4203000	4208000	There are both, both of them are agents.
4208000	4219000	I always suggest that we move with the discussion to later part maybe the anthology gets more clear.
4219000	4229000	I don't have that many more slides but there are a few slides that I would like to show which to some degree speak about these things.
4229000	4238000	I think that important concept here is that you can have transitions in levels of complexity.
4238000	4246000	Whenever you have agents, they interact, they tend to adapt to each other until they become mutually adapted.
4246000	4258000	That means they form a network of synergistic relationships, mutually dependent, and that network when it becomes self-maintaining, it can develop sufficient autonomy so that we will look at it as an agent.
4259000	4271000	An agent itself means that it will transform certain things into other things without being affected by the transformation, not affected in the sense that it loses its autonomy.
4271000	4283000	A super agent in this form is easy to express as a sub-network of agents.
4283000	4290000	I'm going to make drawings here to make it quickly get complicated.
4291000	4294000	That's an old idea of system theory.
4294000	4308000	System theory says you can zoom in and supply your system into a network of subsystems or you can zoom out and look at your system as just one part of a super system.
4308000	4312000	You can do this perfectly with this formalism.
4312000	4320000	At a certain moment you see a certain organization of needs, a self-maintaining network of relationships.
4320000	4323000	You draw a boundary around it and you say that's a system.
4323000	4336000	That system might interpret as a super agent and now I can look at the relation between that super agent and other super agents and then I can put them together in an even bigger level and like that I can build.
4336000	4344000	Some of the examples, these are what we used to call metasystem transitions in the Wikipedia cybernetica project.
4344000	4353000	The origin of life starting from the reaction between molecules is what we are now working on in our double-comp projects trying to simulate that.
4353000	4362000	Symbiogenesis is also a classic example where you have organisms of different types that start living together and form one bigger organism.
4362000	4371000	You can see in multicellularity cells that live together and start differentiating, performing different roles.
4371000	4386000	So each cell is an agent but all the cells together, the multicellular organ also form an agent and of course the emergence of social systems organizations from individuals.
4386000	4393000	A little more example, the cell can be also understood as an orthopedic agent.
4393000	4403000	A cell is something actually that looks very much like this ecosphere, this glass ball that I showed that has an input of light.
4403000	4406000	What are the agents inside the cell?
4406000	4414000	Well actually the genes, the genes are the ones that produce the enzymes and the enzymes are the catalysts of the reactions.
4414000	4424000	So in a sense you could say the genes are the agents inside the cell but it's not like in the old idea that the genes control the cell.
4424000	4438000	No, the genes are individual agents that form a society and the different genes need to mutually agree and coordinate their actions and that's together with the input and output of the cell.
4438000	4441000	The cell is constantly adapting to its environment.
4441000	4449000	So genes, inputs and outputs all together form this one super agent that is this very complex symbiotic network.
4449000	4452000	And what would be the process description of that?
4452000	4457000	Instead of the genes as entities?
4458000	4477000	Well the genes are catalysts which specifically for genes are very stable because the cell wants to store its information in genes so the genes are highly protected between DNA which is difficult to change.
4477000	4497000	Yeah, when you multiply a cell you need to multiply DNA, when you have a sexual recombination you do need to change your DNA so every agent however stable it is within a certain context there will be context in which an agent is formed or distorted.
4497000	4512000	I was thinking more, I hope you will say that the processes start about because in the process ontology, I mean radical process ontology, we will expect that the originary process is not for agents.
4512000	4518000	It's an originary pathway for processes involved.
4518000	4528000	So agents are processes involved and they are embodied and observed through the distinctions we make and this we call the agents but what it works for really is the process.
4528000	4535000	The agents are a kind of local concentrations of processes.
4535000	4541000	So you might say an agent is kind of like a concentrated bunch of processes.
4541000	4554000	That's why I define an agent as a bunch of processes. An agent is really a collection of reactions of processes. An agent is an embodiment of reactions.
4555000	4566000	So from what you said, an agent is simply that which persists through the process. It's this idea of the catalyst.
4566000	4575000	It's the pattern which remains in a sense. All these processes are happening and there's one pattern, there's one thing that's stable the catalyst which kind of goes through.
4575000	4584000	It's the thing which in the end undergoes no difference through the process. Everything else undergoes change and difference and this agent remains the same.
4584000	4588000	Locally during certain processes, not during other processes.
4588000	4598000	So why, I think my question is also like why in trying to construct a kind of in some sense like a process ontology or a relational ontology.
4598000	4601000	The relation is another way of a difference, right?
4601000	4608000	Which I think, I think all of us have basically agreed that it's super important idea, right?
4608000	4618000	But why in constructing a process ontology would you then again put in the central piece the thing which doesn't undergo change?
4618000	4628000	If the whole point of the ontology is the difference is the most important thing, why could, as the central point, exactly the thing which undergoes no difference?
4628000	4629000	For two reasons.
4629000	4638000	The first is to connect with our standard traditional intuitive ontology which sees objects and agents.
4638000	4648000	The second, because evolution has this principle of natural selection, which means that those that are stable survived.
4648000	4652000	Evolution has a tendency to produce things that are more stable.
4652000	4661000	If that wasn't the case, then all this would be one big chaos, like let's say immediately after the big bang.
4661000	4665000	Immediately after the big bang, there wasn't agents, there wasn't stability.
4665000	4672000	There was just one sea of particles reacting with other particles turning into other particles.
4672000	4675000	Happily we're no longer in that state.
4675000	4682000	We are in a state where things have coalesced and stabilized, but the stability is always a stability.
4682000	4685000	But without that stability, we wouldn't be here.
4685000	4687000	We wouldn't be able to sit on this bench.
4687000	4689000	We wouldn't be able to talk.
4689000	4692000	We need to explain why the stability there is...
4692000	4696000	I mean, ontologically there are two big problems.
4696000	4700000	If you start from an ontology of objects, the problem is to explain change.
4700000	4702000	And in my view, you can't.
4702000	4710000	If you start from invariant things or the fundamental building blocks of the world, you cannot explain change.
4710000	4714000	Because if these building blocks are always there, why should they start changing?
4714000	4716000	What causes them to change?
4716000	4721000	If you start from versus ontology, then your problem is to explain stability.
4721000	4725000	We all agree that in the world there is both stability and change.
4725000	4728000	So if you start from the one, you need to explain the other.
4728000	4734000	And it's much easier to explain stability from change than the vice versa.
4734000	4736000	You can't explain change from stability.
4736000	4738000	You can explain stability from change.
4738000	4743000	But stability remains relative. It's not absolute.
4743000	4753000	The concept of time and the special place in your ontology is probably the idea of what is the essence of the process.
4753000	4756000	It rests on the concept of time.
4756000	4760000	So it seems like the whole ontology builds on this concept.
4760000	4771000	I think time, people tend to give time more from the month over the year because I have been working on mathematical models
4771000	4775000	for the emergence of space-time out of processes.
4775000	4779000	So for me, a process is something more fundamental than time.
4779000	4784000	Time assumes that there is someone somewhere, someone with a block,
4784000	4789000	and that all these blocks are synchronized and then where the process happens.
4790000	4797000	So A is turned into, there is someone,
4797000	4800000	what happens at time D2?
4800000	4803000	And that happens at time D1.
4803000	4809000	This is already a very complex construction.
4811000	4816000	At the level of this underneath, it turns into,
4817000	4819000	where is the problem?
4819000	4821000	Where is the time?
4821000	4824000	Time emerges if you have loads of these things.
4824000	4829000	And then you can see that there are something like the space-time concept is in there.
4829000	4836000	And then you can start to look at time, maybe as some way of describing this thing.
4836000	4839000	But we know from the relativity theory that time also is relative.
4839000	4843000	Time for this part is the same as the time for that process.
4843000	4848000	So the idea of time as an absolute thing,
4848000	4851000	time and space,
4851000	4856000	time and space, that's a Newtonian framework.
4856000	4859000	All processes happen in space and time.
4859000	4861000	No, processes happen.
4861000	4866000	And then we look at the arrangement to say,
4866000	4871000	well, we can organize and bundle by putting the space-time code in its own one.
4871000	4875000	But space and time are the same.
4875000	4882000	Quantum mechanics is another example where you see that space doesn't actually play any role,
4882000	4884000	because things can be entangled.
4884000	4886000	It's millions of light years apart.
4886000	4890000	And then how do you define change?
4890000	4892000	The change is primitive.
4892000	4894000	So you don't define change.
4894000	4895000	Change is your primitive.
4895000	4897000	That's an autology.
4897000	4904000	Each autology needs to have a rudimentary, primitive element that is not defined.
4904000	4908000	So the process is the fundamental element.
4908000	4912000	Everything else is built out of the process.
4912000	4913000	Even space and time.
4913000	4917000	And I must admit that the parts that still first stage we mostly,
4917000	4920000	the first thing I did in my PhDs in physics,
4920000	4924000	is make a process of space-time out of processes.
4924000	4929000	It worked, except that I needed to make one assumption,
4929000	4931000	which I'm not happy with.
4931000	4934000	And I still haven't found an alternative for that one assumption.
4934000	4938000	Maybe the assumption is that processes don't go back in time,
4938000	4940000	because if they go back in time,
4940000	4943000	then you lose the whole idea of time order.
4943000	4947000	Why don't you like it?
4947000	4949000	Open possibility.
4950000	4955000	No?
4955000	4959000	Like, these reactions have certain properties, no?
4959000	4962000	Because like, just put, if you have like,
4962000	4964000	opening we have like one reaction happening in the process,
4964000	4966000	and the other reaction will be less difficult.
4966000	4968000	Because we're not moving in time.
4968000	4974000	We only need to suppose and save kind of the same which one going in the process.
4974000	4977000	No, if you go to the lowest level we found.
4977000	4983000	The kind of formalism that we use at the kinetic and the dynamic level,
4983000	4988000	they kind of assume that there is a speed of reaction.
4988000	4993000	At the ontological level, I don't want to assume that.
4993000	4997000	Let's say there is a difference between the ontology and the formalism.
4997000	5000000	In the formalism, you may want to add some parameters
5000000	5006000	and make it easier to model that are not necessarily fundamental in the ontology.
5006000	5016000	I don't yet know whether these processes should have some quantitative speed parameter in there.
5016000	5019000	That's one way to do it. It's an easy way to do it.
5019000	5025000	But I don't like it because it makes an additional assumption
5025000	5028000	which I don't think I will justify.
5028000	5035000	I think that there is something adding to what you were asking.
5035000	5041000	Even though we might not have a measurable or scalar version of time,
5041000	5049000	I think it will be reasonable to assume that if we have a meta-system transition,
5049000	5053000	so we get one level, then we get the emergent level.
5053000	5057000	And then out of this, in this emergent level, there is a new emergent level,
5057000	5060000	like from cells to tissues to tissues to organisms.
5060000	5062000	We have three levels there, for example.
5062000	5067000	We might expect that the processes that make up the voyette in the organism
5067000	5071000	take more time than the processes that make up the voyette in the cell.
5071000	5077000	So still, even if we might not have a time scale, we still have an ordering of time,
5077000	5081000	like an organ. This takes more time than that.
5082000	5087000	I think we at least can kind of make it orderly and critical.
5087000	5092000	And the second thing that maybe has to be following the same point
5092000	5097000	is that every time you make a model representation with a reaction network,
5097000	5106000	you have to make, implicitly, a choice on the level of this time order time scale
5106000	5109000	you're making for the distinctions you want to work with.
5109000	5113000	So now when you say, okay, this A is the COVID model,
5113000	5115000	this is the COVID pandemic in a certain city,
5115000	5118000	and this other B is no pandemic in the city,
5118000	5123000	then you are implicitly assuming a time scale where this reaction,
5123000	5127000	I mean, in the regular physical authority, you're implicitly assuming a time scale
5127000	5130000	and a way of making distinctions in time space.
5130000	5134000	But perfectly, you could change this model into a fine-grainer model
5134000	5139000	where A now is an auto-biotic system of multiple things that embody
5139000	5146000	like our maybe more mesoscale human daily life view of a pandemic.
5146000	5149000	And then the transition, instead of being seen as A goes to B,
5149000	5152000	it might be like a very long process in this other view
5152000	5155000	and even seen as a meta-system transition,
5155000	5162000	that in this other level, you look at it as a fundamental reaction to say,
5162000	5167000	so maybe this choice of basic level of representation
5167000	5172000	and timescales induced by that, which is actually the scientific connection,
5172000	5174000	because you make distinctions somehow,
5174000	5180000	and you have to measure them for the sake of doing a represent scientific
5180000	5183000	driven at this representation of reality.
5183000	5188000	So this part maybe wasn't that explicit in the talk,
5188000	5199000	because it's very kind of not easy to imagine that A is actually a complex,
5199000	5203000	that is auto-biotic somehow, it's defining its own time scale.
5203000	5205000	So, yeah.
5205000	5209000	But it's exactly that confusion that's why I...
5209000	5211000	And then you go back then.
5211000	5215000	I would love to hear it expressed in another language,
5215000	5218000	whereas really we stick to this language of process,
5218000	5224000	because the goal, after all, is to try to make this unification somehow,
5224000	5229000	to try to bring all these different ideas together in this new ontology
5229000	5231000	that can be usable.
5231000	5236000	And it's hard to use because it slips into this other kind of thinking,
5236000	5240000	it slips into thinking that these processes are things.
5241000	5244000	But also, I think what gets lost is a little bit this...
5244000	5249000	Well, I feel as if it's lost is also this coming back to this animism.
5249000	5255000	I think that was also such an intriguing part of the talk,
5255000	5257000	of the word of ideas.
5257000	5261000	And I don't feel like this is how our kind of...
5261000	5266000	My instinct is that I don't feel like this is how our hunter-gatherer nature,
5266000	5272000	of worshipping cousins and four parents thought of this.
5272000	5276000	I think that there's something more about story that's being lost.
5276000	5280000	I think that the idea of story could be really important,
5280000	5284000	because a story is, after all, the most persistent thing in this.
5284000	5288000	I suspect, I would like to experiment it.
5288000	5291000	I think this, in general, has been experimenting with it,
5291000	5295000	that you put up with stories as reactions like that.
5295000	5298000	I mean, I made this human simulation piece,
5298000	5302000	a long time ago, which was played based on reaction networks.
5302000	5306000	But it's also the other thing to think about.
5306000	5310000	If it's about thinking about what's the most persistent agent in all this,
5310000	5312000	well, the most persistent agent is also story,
5312000	5314000	because this is all stories.
5314000	5317000	This is all different ways of telling a story about ontology,
5317000	5320000	about how the world works, and so on and so forth.
5320000	5324000	In a sense, story itself is the most persistent agent,
5324000	5328000	but it's also a process, right?
5328000	5330000	It's persistent, but it's also a process.
5330000	5332000	And I think if you're a hunter-gatherer going through the forest,
5332000	5335000	that's how you perceive things.
5335000	5338000	You perceive yourself as a story in relationship to other stories,
5338000	5341000	and there's also an emotional relationship.
5341000	5344000	The condition of both of our stories is that the story is sequential,
5344000	5346000	because the language is sequential,
5346000	5349000	we can only speak about what's happening at the time,
5349000	5351000	or what this just explains,
5351000	5353000	and this is something that happened in parallel.
5353000	5355000	And if you want something like an altruistic procedure,
5355000	5357000	you see that lots of things are happening in parallel,
5357000	5359000	and that's what the story cannot catch.
5359000	5361000	No, but I think with the mythology, it's different.
5361000	5364000	With the mythology, you have multiple stories in parallel,
5364000	5366000	and you understand intuitively where you're at,
5366000	5368000	and you give the mythology a story.
5368000	5370000	Yeah, but that's not enough to explain something
5370000	5373000	like how the metabolism of a soul works.
5373000	5378000	I don't think any mythological story will capture all that complexity.
5378000	5381000	I don't think even our brain can capture it.
5381000	5384000	I think you will really need a computer model to capture that.
5384000	5387000	But these are stories, though, anyway.
5387000	5390000	I would like to come back to this complaint,
5390000	5395000	which I see the same way.
5395000	5400000	We are looking at a bunch of objects,
5400000	5402000	and how this effect is produced,
5402000	5405000	because you say you would like to hear this language,
5405000	5412000	and I wonder if language is ever able to give you the sound you want to hear,
5412000	5415000	because whatever we will be doing,
5415000	5419000	we are using language which has nouns,
5419000	5423000	which are the basic protocol that we are using,
5423000	5426000	and then it's translated into this.
5426000	5431000	Okay, let's drop nouns, let's pick verbs, and adjectives.
5431000	5434000	Let's do that. You will hear processes.
5434000	5440000	But as long as he can put A is chaos,
5440000	5443000	B is changeability of feelings,
5443000	5446000	and C is wind,
5446000	5449000	and you will say, but why are you speaking about those objects?
5449000	5452000	Because they are named and put there,
5452000	5454000	and they are interacting and so on.
5454000	5456000	So I think this is one contributing factor,
5456000	5458000	which is the major one,
5458000	5462000	that we will not get out of objects if we don't change the language
5462000	5464000	by which we are referring to,
5464000	5468000	which is an underlying method for modeling,
5468000	5470000	the natural language.
5470000	5472000	And another contributing factor,
5472000	5474000	which has to do with this particular formula,
5474000	5479000	is that when you say process ontology,
5479000	5483000	or relational agency,
5483000	5488000	to me, not necessarily some thing changing into something,
5488000	5491000	is the basic relationship.
5492000	5495000	Forget the things, changing into, yes?
5495000	5499000	So of course, I know it's a kernel of your model, yes?
5499000	5501000	But I think relationship,
5501000	5506000	relation, process, doesn't have to be this changing into,
5506000	5510000	and a lot of agencies of relationships
5510000	5514000	are not this changing thing,
5514000	5516000	but exactly persisting of a relationship,
5516000	5518000	which is the agency.
5518000	5522000	A consistent relationship for me is a repeated process,
5522000	5524000	a self-maintaining process.
5524000	5527000	I am done with you,
5527000	5530000	that assumes that from time to time we talk to each other,
5530000	5533000	we exchange information, we help each other,
5533000	5539000	there is a self-maintaining dual person between you and me.
5539000	5543000	Fine, but you could think, yes,
5543000	5549000	that the process or the agency of a relationship,
5549000	5551000	you could approach in modeling,
5551000	5555000	not by arrows, but let's say lines or whatever,
5555000	5559000	that the existence of this friendship is the agent in your life,
5559000	5562000	in my life, in community, and so on.
5562000	5568000	And it's more like an almost like a gravitational field
5568000	5570000	that acts, yes?
5570000	5573000	And then it would be a different model, I know.
5573000	5575000	It's the same model.
5575000	5577000	It's the same model.
5577000	5579000	It's to change the reactions to be suspicious,
5579000	5581000	and suspicious to be reactions.
5581000	5584000	It's actually in the block, it's the same,
5584000	5587000	but you change the, who is who,
5587000	5589000	but it's actually the same model.
5589000	5592000	You mean you can, what I say, you can model with this,
5592000	5594000	this I know, yes?
5594000	5596000	I think one of the problems.
5596000	5599000	Understanding of the relationship as a basic unit.
5599000	5601000	I think one of the problems with the formalism,
5601000	5604000	it's so simple, and the examples are so intuitive,
5604000	5606000	that people immediately assume that,
5606000	5608000	yeah, but it's too simple.
5608000	5611000	They don't see how flexible it is.
5611000	5615000	It is flexible, like A, B, C, and like it's maximum flexibility,
5615000	5618000	because anything can be, like it's a maximum.
5618000	5622000	Except, yeah, I'm now speaking about this,
5622000	5625000	like the ontology of the turning into, yes,
5625000	5627000	that there could be like an ontology of,
5628000	5630000	yeah, just different types of relationships,
5630000	5633000	depending on the situation.
5633000	5636000	It's like, when you define agents,
5636000	5641000	why not defining, like getting rid of agents,
5641000	5644000	and defining it as shared agent disease?
5644000	5645000	Because at the beginning you said,
5645000	5648000	everything is about relationships,
5648000	5651000	and this ontology is based on relationships.
5651000	5653000	So if we have, for example,
5653000	5657000	someone who has that formula, human plus cow,
5657000	5661000	human takes something else on that person's mind.
5661000	5664000	So, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
5664000	5669000	So, probably, I'm thinking of how much of a human is a cow,
5669000	5673000	and how much of a cow is inside a human already,
5673000	5675000	as a potentiality.
5675000	5678000	So, could it be, I suggest,
5678000	5681000	defining as some form of every person,
5681000	5686000	and every entity or thing is a shared agency already?
5686000	5689000	It's kind of like a precondition, defining as everything.
5689000	5692000	What do you define as a shared agency?
5692000	5696000	Meaning that you are, by nature,
5696000	5699000	you are of a relationship nature,
5699000	5701000	rather than that agent.
5701000	5703000	Because when you say an agent,
5703000	5704000	an agent has a boundary,
5704000	5706000	and has its own internal dynamics,
5706000	5708000	based on complex adaptive systems.
5708000	5710000	Yeah, but it also has the relationship.
5710000	5712000	The whole thing is a network.
5712000	5714000	The whole thing is a network.
5714000	5716000	There are no independent things in there.
5716000	5718000	There are no things that are not that work.
5718000	5721000	I mean, if I were to do it...
5731000	5734000	If now I would do one here,
5734000	5736000	that's not possible.
5737000	5740000	Everything needs to be part of the one network.
5740000	5744000	There are no pages that do not interact with other entities.
5744000	5747000	Because if they don't interact, they won't interact.
5747000	5749000	They don't exist.
5754000	5757000	You could call it like that, a field of agencies, yes?
5757000	5760000	Actually, the field metaphor is quite nice,
5760000	5763000	because fields are typically seen as these kind of arrows,
5763000	5766000	but they are like the point in all kind of directions.
5766000	5768000	And what the field does is it creates a flow,
5768000	5770000	it makes things move.
5772000	5774000	That's another way.
5774000	5777000	I mean, there are different metaphors to try to explain this.
5777000	5782000	What I have been emphasizing here is agency and relationality.
5782000	5784000	The basis is process.
5784000	5786000	Why do I define agency?
5786000	5789000	Because of these new approaches.
5789000	5792000	I spoke about multi-agent systems
5792000	5794000	and actual network theory,
5794000	5797000	where people are more and more starting to think in terms of agencies.
5797000	5799000	And why relational?
5799000	5803000	Because the agents do not exist on the whole point of the agency.
5803000	5807000	Everything is one big network of interactions,
5807000	5812000	in which locally you can distinguish agencies,
5812000	5815000	but they are only locally autonomous and stable.
5815000	5817000	They are still part of this larger whole,
5817000	5820000	and this larger whole will change them.
5820000	5822000	But you need local stability,
5822000	5824000	because otherwise you have a world that is like,
5824000	5826000	as I said just after the big bang,
5826000	5829000	a world that is pure, chaos, pure change.
5829000	5832000	You need to explain why this table is stable,
5832000	5834000	and why this thing is stable,
5834000	5836000	and why I'm less stable than the table,
5836000	5840000	but still I will still be there when you talk to me tomorrow.
5840000	5842000	You need to explain that.
5842000	5845000	So you need to explain why in this chaos,
5845000	5848000	this field of actions and interactions,
5848000	5851000	there are islands of stability, which are relative.
5851000	5853000	I mean, they are like floating islands.
5853000	5855000	They don't stay in the same place,
5855000	5857000	but there are kind of islands where you know
5857000	5860000	if you go on the island, you won't sink to the floor.
5860000	5862000	There's stability there.
5862000	5865000	What if you didn't need to explain it?
5865000	5867000	I'm being a little provocative,
5867000	5869000	but what if you just...
5870000	5873000	But you don't need to explain why the table is stable.
5873000	5876000	It's a version of the plan.
5876000	5879000	It seems to be getting in the way.
5879000	5882000	I don't really care about it.
5882000	5884000	You don't really care about it.
5884000	5886000	We're talking to some other people
5886000	5888000	who still believe in internal mechanics,
5888000	5891000	and somehow we want to convince them of our way of thinking.
5891000	5894000	But what if we just left them to their own devices for a while
5894000	5896000	and just go on with thinking about the process
5896000	5898000	without trying to convince them
5898000	5900000	that the table exists?
5900000	5903000	No, as a mystic or as an artist,
5903000	5905000	you might take that attitude,
5905000	5907000	but as somebody who wants to change the world,
5907000	5910000	who wants to be pragmatic, who wants to develop technologies,
5910000	5912000	who wants to do science,
5912000	5914000	you need to look at stable things.
5914000	5916000	You need to make sure that the vaccine you have developed
5916000	5919000	against COVID will still work
5919000	5921000	in five hours from now.
5921000	5924000	If it's just the process and the vaccine changes every minute,
5924000	5926000	then you cancel COVID.
5926000	5929000	I think stability is not about not changing,
5929000	5932000	but about not having an effect on something.
5932000	5935000	And when you look at the table, it's not stable always,
5935000	5938000	because if you fall over a table, it has had an effect on you,
5938000	5940000	so it's not always a stable thing.
5940000	5943000	So it depends how you define stability.
5943000	5946000	If something has even an object as an effect on you,
5946000	5950000	it has agency because it changes your life.
5950000	5953000	So some of these agents are static.
5953000	5955000	There are theories that say,
5955000	5958000	like Vibrant matter that all objects have agency as well,
5958000	5962000	because they can have an effect on other objects or agents.
5962000	5964000	You see what I mean?
5969000	5972000	I'm wondering about the more pragmatic goal, let's say,
5972000	5974000	with regard to what science does,
5974000	5978000	how science does things.
5978000	5982000	And I'm thinking about what is the
5982000	5986000	epistemic value of this ontology
5986000	5989000	opposed to the Italian classical ontology.
5989000	5992000	Because at the end of the day, the collection data
5992000	5996000	and the ontology we have, the metadata we have there,
5996000	6003000	basically, you could call it like stable processes
6003000	6005000	or a stable condition,
6005000	6007000	but at the end of the day,
6007000	6010000	it goes back to the same way of viewing the world,
6010000	6014000	which is just some entities we call it process.
6014000	6018000	I mean, it's just like things like the change of terminology,
6018000	6020000	but at the end of the day, we're doing the same thing.
6020000	6023000	We're going to go back to doing the same thing.
6023000	6026000	No, can I compliment you a little bit?
6026000	6028000	Because it's very much related to your question,
6028000	6030000	and you can answer both at the same time.
6030000	6033000	Which is how, where would you position this?
6033000	6037000	Because it's philosophical standpoint,
6037000	6041000	but also it's kind of linking to science.
6041000	6044000	So where would you put it in the philosophy of science,
6044000	6048000	let's say, traditional groups?
6048000	6051000	I'm not sure I want to put it in the philosophy of science,
6051000	6054000	but what I want to say is, as I said it here,
6054000	6057000	it's an extension of the Newtonian world,
6057000	6061000	which means it does not say Newton was wrong,
6061000	6063000	objects don't exist.
6063000	6067000	It says, in some cases, it is useful to think
6067000	6071000	in terms of objects following the laws of motion of Newton,
6071000	6076000	but if you want to go deeper and especially if you want to look at processes
6076000	6080000	like I say here, life, mind, society, culture,
6080000	6084000	then the thinking in terms of objects is not useful.
6084000	6088000	It's like in classical scientific revolutions
6088000	6091000	like relativity theory of quantum mechanics,
6091000	6096000	relativity theory did not negate Newtonian mechanics.
6096000	6101000	It says Newtonian mechanics is a limit case for low speeds of life,
6101000	6106000	or quantum mechanics will not say Newtonian mechanics is incorrect.
6106000	6110000	Newtonian mechanics is, let's say, Newtonian mechanics
6110000	6114000	is an approximation for macroscopic objects.
6114000	6119000	So in that sense, Newtonian mechanics and all the existing theories of science
6119000	6123000	are not negated by this, but they are seen as a limit case
6123000	6130000	for more specific situations where the processes are very simple
6130000	6134000	and you don't have to take into account all these complex
6134000	6137000	anthropometric self-maintaining interactions.
6137000	6141000	So what this does is expand the field of things you can describe
6141000	6145000	to things like life, mind, consciousness, etc.
6145000	6149000	But without giving up the old stuff which we know works,
6149000	6153000	it's just that we don't take it as literally anymore.
6153000	6157000	We're not going to say that atoms are like billion balls, we know that,
6157000	6163000	but still sometimes it can be useful to think of an atom like a billion ball.
6163000	6166000	You mentioned the measurement of a model,
6166000	6169000	to make it really concrete.
6169000	6173000	I'd be interested in seeing a very simple application.
6173000	6177000	You mentioned I want to do research on humans around societies
6177000	6180000	and I'm going to do that using mathematical models.
6180000	6183000	So in what way will I do it different than I did before
6183000	6186000	because of this ontology?
6186000	6189000	Well, we have a number of mathematical models like that.
6189000	6192000	Two people in the audience are doing that.
6192000	6197000	In the online models, the last two are starting today.
6197000	6200000	But I would like to compliment on your answer,
6200000	6205000	because the title I think is extremely clear on that,
6205000	6210000	but maybe since it's the title, it's also kind of overseen.
6210000	6213000	Is the ontology for transdisciplinary?
6213000	6217000	Do you call it transdisciplinary in science?
6217000	6223000	Yeah, so the point is that in traditional science,
6223000	6228000	the act of identifying the objects is kind of immediate.
6228000	6230000	You want to study in ecology.
6230000	6232000	What do you have? Species, resources?
6232000	6236000	It's kind of like the ontology that we can equip with
6236000	6238000	from natural language is already given us.
6238000	6241000	The entities we want to observe and it's all kind of,
6241000	6243000	culturally, you know, constructed.
6243000	6244000	It's easy to say,
6244000	6247000	ah, we're going to study these things that already have a language on.
6247000	6250000	When it comes to transdisciplinary research,
6250000	6252000	the problem of identifying the objects,
6252000	6255000	it's already like, what are your guys?
6255000	6257000	What are the guys that we will be studying with?
6257000	6259000	That's already a problem.
6259000	6263000	And that's why the traditional approaches in V6 and so on,
6263000	6265000	might, for sure.
6265000	6267000	Because you don't want to study the entities themselves.
6267000	6271000	You want to study the meta-guys that seem to be more representative
6271000	6277000	of the phenomenon than the entities that are composing this phenomenon.
6277000	6282000	Like in COVID, me being sick, neighbor of someone not sick,
6282000	6285000	it's like, it's not the phenomenon of COVID.
6285000	6287000	But that's how in agent-based models,
6287000	6289000	and you saw, like, all the data that you were doing in the pandemic
6289000	6293000	was focusing on the basic entities doing models
6293000	6295000	and seeing how this thing works.
6295000	6299000	But another perspective is to look at the whole of the situation,
6299000	6300000	of course, composed by parts,
6300000	6304000	but looking at the potential states of this global situation.
6304000	6308000	And there is something called the top-down interactions,
6308000	6310000	that maybe Francis, you can explain better than me,
6310000	6312000	which is also interesting,
6312000	6315000	but because when you don't know what this big guy,
6315000	6317000	this major transition guys are,
6317000	6320000	and then you identify them, you can see that this meta-system
6320000	6325000	is also making the influences of the individuals.
6325000	6329000	And that's, like, in social science, it's very common.
6329000	6331000	Maybe you mark an example.
6331000	6333000	So, top-down.
6333000	6338000	How is it different than just a very complex system?
6339000	6343000	So using, like, if you look at standard psychological research,
6343000	6346000	they use also observable objects,
6346000	6348000	like intelligence and personality.
6348000	6351000	And then you could just build the top of those
6351000	6353000	becomes very complex stuff,
6353000	6356000	which I get in society with multiple people
6356000	6359000	and directing in very complex ways also with objects.
6359000	6363000	Yeah, the point is that this provides, I mean, in my view,
6363000	6365000	Francis, you can say, no, she's wrong,
6365000	6368000	but in my view, this provides a conceptual framework
6368000	6371000	to start understanding the levels of representation.
6371000	6373000	And it's not just from scratch,
6373000	6376000	and then I look at statistical macro properties
6376000	6378000	and then I say, this is happening.
6378000	6381000	Because this is the typical complex systems thinking
6381000	6386000	that the guys approach any big question from the model.
6386000	6389000	And there is no conceptual framework to think about
6389000	6391000	the different levels that start appearing
6391000	6395000	and the meta-level interactions that can happen.
6395000	6398000	So if you start from this perspective,
6398000	6402000	you have like a set of principles that you want to look at
6402000	6404000	before saying, ah, this is the phenomenon.
6404000	6407000	You want to build the story of the complex system
6407000	6409000	level by level, let's say.
6409000	6412000	And I think this is an important game,
6412000	6416000	and particularly we have been doing models
6416000	6419000	or trying to conceptualize better notions
6419000	6423000	that are typically intermediate like sustainability
6423000	6427000	or resilience or concepts or notions of that kind,
6427000	6432000	that kind of when you look from the very bottom part of the system,
6432000	6435000	you kind of fall short of explaining,
6435000	6438000	but if you look at these different layers.
6438000	6440000	I would like to add something.
6440000	6445000	I made my PhD in physics of the structure of physical models,
6445000	6448000	and I came to the conclusion that my analysis
6448000	6451000	in Newton and Feynman, that there are always a number
6451000	6454000	of ontological elements that are kind of assumed.
6454000	6456000	You first assume that there are your objects.
6456000	6460000	In your case, might be people or organizations.
6460000	6462000	These objects have properties.
6462000	6466000	These properties can take on different values.
6466000	6468000	These different values define states.
6468000	6471000	These different states define a state space.
6471000	6474000	And then you assume some kind of a dynamics
6474000	6477000	of how the properties change over time
6477000	6479000	under the influence of different forces.
6479000	6482000	And like that, you build layer on top of layer,
6482000	6485000	and then you get typically a very complicated model.
6485000	6488000	But actually all your ontological assumptions
6488000	6490000	are already fixed in the model.
6490000	6494000	So afterwards, you can maybe fine tune a little bit
6494000	6497000	by changing this parameter or that.
6497000	6501000	You can no longer change the model while you're working on it.
6501000	6506000	Or with this kind of modeling, I just add a few reactions.
6506000	6508000	And the whole model changes.
6508000	6511000	But not in a way that you lose what you had.
6511000	6513000	You can put it in your simulation,
6513000	6516000	and you see that if I add two or three reactions,
6516000	6518000	or I move two or three reactions,
6518000	6520000	well, the dynamics changes.
6520000	6522000	But you don't have to throw away everything.
6522000	6525000	You don't have to start from scratch.
6525000	6527000	Then that's what makes it so easy.
6527000	6528000	You add a few things.
6528000	6530000	You take away a few things.
6530000	6533000	And each time you have a working model,
6533000	6535000	and some of those will be better,
6535000	6537000	some of those will be worse,
6537000	6539000	you don't need to start from scratch.
6542000	6548000	With this micro-macro level of reactions to the emergence,
6548000	6551000	we also defined a process
6551000	6555000	because it seemed to be happening in parallel
6555000	6557000	between the two.
6557000	6562000	So, for example,
6562000	6568000	the relationship between the two
6568000	6571000	to one is intermingled on the other.
6571000	6574000	So, is this also a process?
6574000	6579000	I don't like the subject of super-medium.
6579000	6582000	I speak by the shape of emotions
6582000	6584000	to what I love at home,
6584000	6588000	because properties that don't are not properties of the form.
6588000	6590000	And how do you get growth?
6593000	6595000	Because it's here,
6595000	6598000	if I have more or less growth,
6598000	6602000	I'll make a lot.
6602000	6603000	I don't think there's a hope,
6603000	6605000	but of course, there are still things
6605000	6606000	that you can't go out,
6606000	6610000	because nothing is isolated.
6610000	6613000	And now I can look at this as a whole,
6613000	6615000	and this as a whole will have properties,
6615000	6617000	because what comes in here
6617000	6620000	undergoes all kinds of nonlinear interactions,
6620000	6623000	whatever comes out here.
6623000	6625000	It's not what went in here.
6625000	6628000	It's not one of the things in there.
6628000	6630000	It's the whole self-maintaining thing
6630000	6632000	that has produced this output.
6632000	6636000	And yeah, so I say this thing as a whole
6636000	6639000	reacts in a different way than any of it from God.
6639000	6642000	It has emergent properties.
6642000	6644000	But in this case,
6644000	6648000	I can say how I'll see things like this.
6648000	6651000	I don't need to know all these details inside
6651000	6653000	to simplify my model
6653000	6655000	or just to get what comes in and what goes out.
6655000	6656000	In other cases,
6656000	6658000	I might want to look inside
6658000	6659000	and look at all these things
6659000	6660000	and then notice that actually
6660000	6665000	there are still small ones in there.
6665000	6667000	And then I can make my model as detailed
6667000	6671000	or as close as I want.
6671000	6673000	That's what you want of models.
6673000	6675000	There are always simplifications,
6675000	6677000	but the question is to leave out the things
6677000	6679000	that you find less important
6679000	6682000	and to get in the things that are most important.
6682000	6685000	And then by experimenting with this language,
6685000	6689000	I think it's much easier to make good models.
6689000	6690000	Yeah.
6690000	6692000	I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more
6692000	6695000	how the mind fits into the smaller part
6696000	6697000	of this model,
6697000	6702000	particularly with respect to the mind.
6702000	6703000	Actually, the mind is,
6703000	6706000	you might say, the most obvious application
6706000	6708000	of which I started by saying
6708000	6711000	that the character is a matter
6711000	6713000	that follows these deterministic rules,
6713000	6714000	these deterministic rules,
6714000	6716000	and that is the mind
6716000	6718000	that can think of its own free,
6718000	6720000	that has free will and accessionality.
6720000	6723000	What I say is agency is something
6723000	6726000	that's in between the passive object
6726000	6729000	and the free will in mind.
6729000	6732000	And depending on how much agency there is,
6732000	6734000	it will have more of these properties
6734000	6737000	that we associate with mind, intelligence, emotions,
6737000	6740000	memories, values, goals,
6740000	6742000	and agency as I have developed it
6742000	6744000	in a couple of other papers.
6744000	6746000	And what we are doing now in our project is,
6746000	6748000	as this network,
6748000	6750000	this anthropogenic network becomes
6750000	6752000	what we call more resilient,
6752000	6754000	which means more adaptive,
6754000	6758000	more able to deal with more difference outside situations,
6758000	6759000	it becomes smarter,
6759000	6761000	it becomes more autonomous,
6761000	6765000	it becomes less dependent on the external conditions.
6765000	6766000	And at a certain moment,
6766000	6768000	people say it has a mind,
6768000	6771000	and for me, there is no such thing as mind or no mind.
6771000	6773000	It's a continuum.
6773000	6774000	I call it agency,
6774000	6776000	and there is low levels of agency.
6776000	6779000	The particle has a very low level of agency,
6779000	6781000	and my brain has a very high level of agency,
6781000	6784000	and in between you have bacteria,
6784000	6786000	and trees, and rocks,
6786000	6788000	and they all have agency,
6788000	6791000	which means they all have some degree of mind.
6791000	6794000	That's also implied in some of your consciousness,
6794000	6796000	or what is consciousness?
6796000	6799000	Consciousness, I interpret as sensation.
6799000	6801000	This thing is sensitive,
6801000	6806000	because if there is an impulse, it changes.
6806000	6814000	So, the example I gave with the a and the b,
6814000	6816000	a produces b,
6816000	6819000	b produces a,
6819000	6823000	not suppose that there is also a reaction,
6823000	6826000	a plus c is d,
6826000	6830000	the moment I bring d into the system,
6830000	6833000	d plus c into the system,
6833000	6836000	c plus a will produce b,
6836000	6839000	which means there will be less a available.
6839000	6841000	The system feels,
6841000	6844000	it senses that something is not the way it should be.
6844000	6846000	What is the way it should be?
6846000	6848000	Self-maintenance.
6848000	6851000	Natural selection leads to systems that are self-maintaining.
6851000	6853000	The moment something happens
6853000	6855000	that affects the self-maintenance,
6855000	6857000	they sense it, they feel it,
6857000	6859000	and they will react to it.
6859000	6861000	That's the other point,
6861000	6865000	you become sensitive to the perturbations,
6865000	6868000	and then you act to compensate the perturbations.
6868000	6870000	The self is consciousness.
6870000	6872000	It's a consciousness,
6872000	6874000	but at a very, very limited level.
6874000	6876000	At a very primitive level,
6876000	6879000	just the bacterium is conscious of the fact
6879000	6882000	that it is moving in an environment where there is toxins,
6882000	6884000	because it has certain rules that says that
6884000	6886000	if toxins concentration increase,
6886000	6888000	then it should move,
6888000	6890000	change direction,
6890000	6892000	and move in a different direction.
6892000	6895000	The bacterium is sensitive to toxins.
6895000	6898000	It feels that there are toxins,
6898000	6900000	and it performs the action
6900000	6902000	to move away from these toxins.
6902000	6904000	So it's a kind of a consciousness
6904000	6906000	if you want to pull it like that.
6908000	6911000	Some people call this panpsychism,
6911000	6913000	that even environmental biologists
6913000	6915000	have this sensation.
6915000	6917000	If you want to pull it like that,
6917000	6919000	I don't object,
6919000	6921000	but I just wouldn't use the term
6921000	6923000	to call it unmindedly.
6923000	6926000	It's a question of more of a taste
6926000	6930000	in terminology than in a conceptual difference.
6930000	6932000	For me, mind is a continuum
6932000	6935000	from a lot of particles to the human brain,
6935000	6937000	and...
6942000	6944000	I don't know if you have seen
6944000	6946000	the magic work of David
6946000	6948000	from this notion of intelligence,
6948000	6950000	and it's very similar to what you...
6950000	6952000	Have you seen that?
6952000	6954000	Because you kind of have gotten...
6954000	6956000	I have had a couple of papers of Levin,
6956000	6958000	and he has a very similar...
6958000	6960000	I was with you for an article on that.
6960000	6962000	Michael Levin has a very similar...
6962000	6964000	It's Levin,
6964000	6966000	he speaks of this...
6966000	6968000	well, like,
6968000	6970000	similar kind of relativity,
6970000	6972000	we rely on it,
6972000	6974000	the whole of intelligence.
6974000	6976000	It's like this planet we can reach
6976000	6978000	with no consciousness
6978000	6980000	in the process, like sense,
6980000	6982000	and then he says,
6982000	6984000	okay, where is David now, humans,
6984000	6986000	and then a group of humans
6986000	6988000	has a higher goal,
6988000	6990000	so a higher intelligence,
6990000	6992000	and then he controls
6992000	6994000	things and planets and stuff.
6994000	6996000	So he goes all the way up to...
6996000	6998000	Yeah, I think his model
6998000	7000000	is simple and mind,
7000000	7002000	a little bit too simplistic,
7002000	7004000	he kind of imagined that
7004000	7006000	if this is me,
7008000	7010000	and this is space,
7010000	7012000	and this is time,
7012000	7014000	then I'm aware of a certain region
7014000	7016000	in space-time.
7016000	7018000	That's my memory of what has happened.
7018000	7020000	This is my idea
7020000	7022000	of what's going on in other places
7022000	7024000	in the universe,
7024000	7026000	and this is my anticipation of what might happen.
7026000	7028000	And then he says, for a human,
7028000	7030000	it will be big,
7030000	7032000	but for a dog, it will be small,
7032000	7034000	and for a bacteria,
7034000	7036000	it will be tiny.
7036000	7038000	So he says it's the wider the range,
7038000	7040000	it's the higher your consciousness
7040000	7042000	or your agency.
7042000	7044000	It's one way
7044000	7046000	to do it.
7046000	7048000	Time is up.
7048000	7050000	Thank you very much.
7050000	7052000	Close here.
7054000	7056000	Are there any questions from the group?
7056000	7058000	Yeah, we didn't even ask
7058000	7060000	because there were so many questions
7060000	7062000	in the room, and now it's time
7062000	7064000	it's up, so we want to extend it
7064000	7066000	for a bit.
7066000	7068000	For me, can we extend it a bit?
7068000	7070000	Yeah, so
7070000	7072000	if there are any questions
7072000	7074000	from the audience online,
7074000	7076000	because soon we will be moving
7076000	7078000	to a more informal part
7078000	7080000	of the meeting
7080000	7082000	and leaving this room, so
7082000	7084000	I think we can take
7084000	7086000	one or two questions from
7086000	7088000	from the online audience
7088000	7090000	if there's any
7090000	7092000	questions there.
7092000	7094000	Guys?
7094000	7096000	Look.
7096000	7098000	Here it is.
7098000	7100000	Here it is.
7100000	7102000	Anyone?
7102000	7104000	Anyone?
7104000	7106000	I have perhaps
7106000	7108000	a small comment
7108000	7110000	only.
7110000	7112000	Is it clear?
7112000	7114000	Can everybody hear me?
7114000	7116000	No, just to comment a little bit
7116000	7118000	first of all, very interesting
7118000	7120000	talk. Francis, I enjoyed a lot
7120000	7122000	and
7122000	7124000	I would like to comment a little bit
7124000	7126000	on the observation that Orion
7126000	7128000	and Marta were making also.
7128000	7130000	Why starting
7130000	7132000	from
7132000	7134000	this kind of ontology?
7134000	7136000	It could
7136000	7138000	be that we will have
7138000	7140000	some more surprises, of course
7140000	7142000	if science develops more
7142000	7144000	and there could be some hints
7144000	7146000	already
7146000	7148000	and the comment I want to make
7148000	7150000	is a little story
7150000	7152000	that Feynman once
7152000	7154000	said
7154000	7156000	in the beginning of the quantum
7156000	7158000	computer idea
7158000	7160000	there was then a whole theory
7160000	7162000	in computer science
7162000	7164000	the Turing machine
7164000	7166000	a kind of a fundamental theory
7166000	7168000	the Turing machine would be the
7168000	7170000	fundamental entity of
7170000	7172000	computation
7172000	7174000	and still many many computer
7174000	7176000	scientists work with this as a
7176000	7178000	fundamental entity of
7178000	7180000	computation and then the quantum
7180000	7182000	computer came
7182000	7184000	and Feynman once said
7184000	7186000	the problem with Turing is that
7186000	7188000	he didn't know what paper was
7188000	7190000	what a strip of paper was you see
7190000	7192000	and so
7192000	7194000	the Turing machine
7194000	7196000	you need a strip of paper
7196000	7198000	for the material world
7198000	7200000	and so quantum computer
7200000	7202000	doesn't
7202000	7204000	work with strips of paper
7204000	7206000	things are not on paper anymore
7206000	7208000	and I think we will stumble
7208000	7210000	at a certain moment and that might
7210000	7212000	when I hear
7212000	7214000	Orion say why not
7214000	7216000	start with stories
7216000	7218000	of course you can see as a scientist
7218000	7220000	very difficult to have a grasp on a story
7220000	7222000	but we might
7222000	7224000	stumble on the foundations
7224000	7226000	I think where even
7226000	7228000	writing on a blackboard
7228000	7230000	or what we can do mathematically
7230000	7232000	will be too limited
7232000	7234000	to really go deep into
7234000	7236000	reality because if you write
7236000	7238000	on a blackboard a, b, c
7238000	7240000	it's of course
7240000	7242000	something specific you do
7242000	7244000	a gives
7244000	7246000	b, b gives c
7246000	7248000	you cannot
7248000	7250000	do what eventually a quantum computer
7250000	7252000	could do you know on a blackboard
7252000	7254000	so
7254000	7256000	just my comment
7256000	7258000	would be that
7258000	7260000	in an amazing way
7260000	7262000	we might
7262000	7264000	be repeating parochial things
7264000	7266000	in some way like the old
7266000	7268000	reductionist
7268000	7270000	like the old reductionist
7270000	7272000	in the time of
7272000	7274000	and not be completely aware of it
7278000	7280000	that is a little bit what could
7280000	7282000	be
7282000	7284000	the future of
7284000	7286000	and then of course we will have to change again
7286000	7288000	we will have to adapt
7288000	7290000	to new findings and stuff like that
7292000	7294000	and I think that is a little bit
7294000	7296000	what sometimes is felt also
7296000	7298000	yeah processes but
7298000	7300000	processes okay you can
7300000	7302000	you can make it say
7302000	7304000	it's perhaps not in time
7304000	7306000	but there is something also
7306000	7308000	that limits our self
7308000	7310000	being on a blackboard to imagine
7310000	7312000	with our material mind
7312000	7314000	what can happen
7314000	7316000	so even there I think
7316000	7318000	there are some limitations
7318000	7320000	if you really go to the depth
7320000	7322000	of what an ontology is
7324000	7326000	I don't know
7326000	7328000	I don't know what the limitations are
7328000	7330000	there are some hints here and there
7330000	7332000	I think
7332000	7334000	so
7334000	7336000	does it mean that
7336000	7338000	every
7338000	7340000	every century
7340000	7342000	or every generation
7342000	7344000	every kind of dancing
7344000	7346000	around the sun in reality
7346000	7348000	we remake the reductionism
7348000	7350000	it's got like a new
7350000	7352000	there will be new reductionism
7354000	7356000	does it
7356000	7358000	I think every form of knowledge
7358000	7360000	is a simplification of reality
7360000	7362000	a model is a reduction
7362000	7364000	you should be aware that it is a reduction
7364000	7366000	as long as you're aware of that
7366000	7368000	I don't think there is much danger
7368000	7370000	in the moment you start taking
7370000	7372000	your model for reality that's when it
7372000	7374000	becomes dangerous because then you are
7374000	7376000	reductionist then you think that what your model
7376000	7378000	says is what the real world is
7378000	7380000	a model is something that helps
7380000	7382000	you to predict and to understand certain
7382000	7384000	things and if it turns out
7384000	7386000	that something that doesn't predict
7386000	7388000	doesn't understand that well then you may change
7388000	7390000	your model but you should not take the model
7390000	7392000	for reality model is by definition
7392000	7394000	simplification that means a reduction
7394000	7396000	reductionism
7396000	7398000	reductionism is to me
7398000	7400000	means that you
7400000	7402000	it's a world view where you
7402000	7404000	take the relationships into account
7404000	7406000	so you think that somehow the world can be
7406000	7408000	explained by things
7408000	7410000	but not really
7410000	7412000	their relationships are the interest
7412000	7414000	there is no reductionism is like that
7414000	7416000	but I think the reductionism that Derek
7416000	7418000	and Sima are talking about is the fact
7418000	7420000	that you reduce things to
7420000	7422000	some marks of a rightful
7422000	7424000	and of course
7424000	7426000	reality is more
7426000	7428000	comparing than those agencies
7428000	7430000	and of course it is more complex
7430000	7432000	of course this is a simplification
7432000	7434000	it's a simplification which no longer
7434000	7436000	assumes objects
7436000	7438000	it assumes process is an interrelationship
7438000	7440000	but still
7440000	7442000	when I try to represent it on the rightful
7442000	7444000	it's a simplification that's unavoidable
7444000	7446000	if I
7446000	7448000	the only way
7448000	7450000	to communicate the whole
7450000	7452000	of reality is to
7452000	7454000	experience the whole of reality
7454000	7456000	I can't transfer the whole of reality
7456000	7458000	to you, to your mind
7458000	7460000	I have to put it into language
7460000	7462000	and to Simba that is also simplification
7462000	7464000	the reductionism
7464000	7466000	can also take a different context and reactions
7466000	7468000	you just start from the most
7468000	7470000	basic particles
7470000	7472000	and then you can make it very complex
7472000	7474000	that is the advantage of this thing
7474000	7476000	it's what I would call an open underneath model
7476000	7478000	it's a model where you can
7478000	7480000	add and change things as much as you want
7480000	7482000	you don't have to make
7482000	7484000	certain assumptions that there are these particles
7484000	7486000	and they have these properties and no other copies
7486000	7488000	and they obey these flows
7488000	7490000	and no other goals
7490000	7492000	let's say reductionism you
7492000	7494000	make this ontological assumption
7494000	7496000	and they absolutely can't be changed
7496000	7498000	well here the only assumption that I make
7498000	7500000	is that there are conditions
7500000	7502000	that sometimes transform into other conditions
7502000	7504000	and if
7504000	7506000	these transformations
7506000	7508000	appear in a certain pattern
7508000	7510000	and I see that there is stability
7510000	7512000	and there is self-maintenance
7512000	7514000	and then I can start saying non-trivial things about them
7516000	7518000	but I don't
7518000	7520000	say what those ABCs
7520000	7522000	are and what the arrows
7522000	7524000	precisely are, I don't say when they happen
7524000	7526000	or how long they happen
7526000	7528000	that makes it open
7528000	7530000	it makes it flexible
7542000	7544000	time to finish
7544000	7546000	no it was
7552000	7554000	was that
7554000	7556000	so we move it to the bar
7556000	7558000	okay and thank you
7566000	7568000	thank you everybody online
7568000	7570000	I'm closing the results
