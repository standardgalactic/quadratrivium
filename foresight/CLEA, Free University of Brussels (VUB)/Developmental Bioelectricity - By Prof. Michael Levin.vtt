WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.800
Yeah, I hear some echoes of people could. Yeah, I think we have to mute. It's us probably.

00:16.800 --> 00:23.280
So I will mute myself before once you start. So, okay, we were having now like Michael

00:23.600 --> 00:32.000
talk. And I think, where is your screen share? Are you sharing a screen?

00:33.200 --> 00:35.040
Correct. I'm already sharing the screen. Yeah.

00:36.400 --> 00:41.600
Can people not see my screen? We don't we don't see your screen, but it might be.

00:41.600 --> 00:54.240
You don't see this? Are people not seeing the slides? It's us. It's us that we are not

00:55.280 --> 01:02.640
swap video. There you go. Okay. So now we have you. And let's confirm with the other. Yeah,

01:02.640 --> 01:07.760
the audience can see it. So we are fine. Okay. Welcome, Michael. Thank you for participating

01:07.760 --> 01:14.960
in our conference and workshop and the stage is yours. Very good. Thank you so much for inviting

01:14.960 --> 01:20.800
me. This has been an extremely interesting workshop. Lots of new ideas. And I look forward to sharing

01:20.800 --> 01:26.960
some more information with you and some thoughts. All of the primary papers and if you need to get

01:26.960 --> 01:31.040
in touch with me, these two websites, you can reach me all the papers, the data, the software,

01:31.040 --> 01:36.960
everything is there. What I'm going to tell you about today is a framework that I've been developing

01:36.960 --> 01:44.480
based on our empirical data. So probably about 15 years of work at the intersection of developmental

01:44.480 --> 01:52.480
biology and computer science that has driven my attempt to pull together some deep ideas

01:52.480 --> 01:58.400
for how to understand this and how to move it forward. And I call this TAME, T-A-M-E, that

01:58.400 --> 02:03.040
stands for technological approach to mind everywhere. And basically it's a framework for

02:03.040 --> 02:09.200
understanding truly diverse intelligences. You'll see what I mean by that based on fundamentals

02:09.200 --> 02:14.480
of a kind of goal directed behavior in unconventional agents. So the main points

02:14.480 --> 02:20.880
that I would like to transmit today are these. First, that the question of how much agency

02:20.880 --> 02:26.720
or cognition is to be attributed to a particular system has to be treated as an engineering

02:26.720 --> 02:31.440
problem, not philosophical pronouncements of what various systems can and can't have,

02:31.440 --> 02:40.080
but actually an empirical approach to find the optimum level of description to enable control

02:40.080 --> 02:47.040
and prediction of that system. And I'm going to talk about the fact that very diverse intelligences

02:47.040 --> 02:52.160
can actually be directly compared with each other and placed in a sort of the same space.

02:52.160 --> 02:57.760
If we think about the spatiotemporal scale of the goals that these systems are capable of working

02:57.760 --> 03:02.480
towards. So this gives rise to a kind of a model of what I call the cognitive light cone

03:02.480 --> 03:06.720
based on the types of goals that these systems are able to represent and pursue.

03:07.360 --> 03:12.000
And I'm going to show you that synthetic bioengineering and some advances in biology

03:12.000 --> 03:19.120
provide an incredibly large option space for new bodies and new minds. These new creatures don't

03:19.120 --> 03:26.000
have standard evolutionary backstories in this. They are a very important set of systems for

03:26.000 --> 03:31.120
impacting our understanding of evolution of what the genome actually does and so on.

03:31.840 --> 03:37.680
And I'm going to show you some very specific examples from developmental biology looking at

03:38.400 --> 03:43.200
morphogenesis as a kind of unconventional collective intelligence, meaning the collective

03:43.200 --> 03:48.240
intelligence of cells, solving problems in morpho space. That will be the example in which I'm

03:48.240 --> 03:51.680
going to illustrate some of these concepts, but I think they're much, much broader than that.

03:52.160 --> 03:57.680
And I'm going to show you some data showing that developmental bioelectricity provides

03:57.680 --> 04:02.400
an interesting window on the scaling of cognition both during development and during evolution.

04:03.040 --> 04:09.760
So I started this framework prompted by a really interesting conference at the

04:11.040 --> 04:14.960
Diverse Intelligence Summer Institute that Templeton Foundation put on

04:15.680 --> 04:20.800
where we were asked to come up with a way to compare truly diverse intelligences. And this

04:20.800 --> 04:26.800
isn't just humans, apes, birds, and maybe octopus, things like that, but it's actually,

04:26.800 --> 04:32.800
it needs to, a good framework is going to enable us to compare and contrast really unusual creatures,

04:32.800 --> 04:39.440
colonial organisms, swarms like ants and bees and so on, but also synthetic biology, so engineered

04:39.440 --> 04:44.320
novel life forms that never existed before, both unicellular and multicellular. We should be able

04:44.320 --> 04:51.040
to use the same framework with AI, so artificial intelligences, whether embodied or purely software

04:51.040 --> 04:58.640
or whatever. And of course, exobiological agents that we may find during exploration of off the

04:58.640 --> 05:03.680
planet if that ever happens. And the key to this framework is that it has to move experiments

05:03.680 --> 05:08.960
forward. It cannot be pure philosophy, it has to actually suggest, make predictions and suggest

05:08.960 --> 05:14.160
novel capabilities. So the outline for today's talk, I'm going to, isn't basically in three parts.

05:14.160 --> 05:21.520
First, I'm just going to talk about some examples and some, some, some, some ways in which we should

05:21.520 --> 05:27.440
broaden typical cognitive science approaches. Then I will talk about this, this framework,

05:27.440 --> 05:32.640
the philosophical principles, and then some very specific hypotheses for how we can define

05:32.640 --> 05:37.600
selves and how cognition can scale. And then I'm going to show you the vast majority of the talk

05:37.600 --> 05:43.120
is data. So I'm going to show you how we've been using these ideas to understand and control

05:43.120 --> 05:47.920
morphogenesis as a collective intelligence. And then I'm going to show you some novel synthetic

05:47.920 --> 05:53.280
organisms that, that have never existed before. And these are called xenobots. So the first thing

05:53.280 --> 05:59.040
I want to think about is the fact that when we usually think about intelligence and, and, and

05:59.040 --> 06:04.640
cognition and agency, we think about the subject of all of those things, the self. So the self is

06:04.640 --> 06:11.040
this construct that is the owner of complex memories of credit assignment among the individual parts

06:11.040 --> 06:17.200
that function together to, to provide positive and negative outcomes. It's the, it's the owner

06:17.200 --> 06:22.160
of goals and, and preferences and things like that. And the interesting thing about this is that

06:22.160 --> 06:27.920
biology shows us that these, these selves are extremely malleable. They change over time,

06:27.920 --> 06:32.720
not just evolutionary time, but actually during the time of the, the time of the organism.

06:32.720 --> 06:37.600
So for example, here's, here's one example. So this is a caterpillar. And it's a creature,

06:37.600 --> 06:43.520
it's a soft bodied kind of creature that crawls and chews plants. And it needs to turn into this

06:43.520 --> 06:48.240
very different type of creature that flies and drinks nectar. And because of that, the brain

06:48.240 --> 06:52.400
is completely different. So the caterpillar brain is quite different from the, from the,

06:52.400 --> 06:58.640
of butterfly or moth brain. And during this process of metamorphosis, that brain is largely

06:58.720 --> 07:03.280
liquefied, the cells, many of the cells die, most of the synaptic connections are broken.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.440
And a completely new brain is rearranged. This is all during the lifetime of the agent. So if,

07:09.440 --> 07:13.120
you know, if you're philosophically minded, you can ask yourself what it's like to be an agent

07:13.840 --> 07:18.640
during, during the time that your brain is completely reorganized. One of the most amazing

07:18.640 --> 07:23.600
things about this is that the memories, which caterpillars have, in fact, persist through

07:23.600 --> 07:29.360
this process. So the butterfly remembers training that the caterpillars underwent and there's,

07:29.360 --> 07:35.600
there's some nice data on this, you can see reviews of that here. But this is, this is in

07:35.600 --> 07:40.560
fact, not just for, for unusual metamorphosing creatures, all of us made the journey of the

07:40.560 --> 07:45.920
Cartesian cut from a single cell. So we all started life as a single fertilized egg. This is

07:45.920 --> 07:50.400
something that molecular biologists would look and say, this is a machine, this is, you know,

07:50.400 --> 07:54.720
it's a molecular machine. It has lots of biochemical components functioning according to

07:54.720 --> 08:01.120
rules. It's a very nice, you know, it's a very nice piece of physics. And then at some point,

08:01.120 --> 08:07.040
this, this self assembled into one of many creatures in some of which, at least or

08:07.040 --> 08:12.000
possibly all of them have what we consider to be cognition, let's say human in the case of a human

08:12.000 --> 08:17.920
embryo. So all of us went from undertook this journey. And so, so one thing that is clear in

08:17.920 --> 08:24.160
biology is that there is no sharp line that is supportable, where you can say this was just

08:24.160 --> 08:28.240
physics and then something happened and now you have a cognitive being. So, so we have to understand

08:28.240 --> 08:35.680
how, how cognition scales gradually across these kind of scales and it modifies gradually, both

08:35.680 --> 08:42.240
during evolutionary time scales and the animals own development. So this is another way in which

08:42.240 --> 08:47.200
ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny because we all take this, take this journey. So in fact,

08:48.080 --> 08:53.280
we like to think of ourselves as integrated beings, true intelligences, and then maybe

08:53.840 --> 08:58.400
ants and bees have some sort of collective intelligence. But actually, we are all collective

08:58.400 --> 09:04.400
intelligences. We are all made of parts. We are, in particular, we have collections of neurons

09:04.400 --> 09:10.160
and various other cells. And so when you look through, through life forms, you see that they

09:10.160 --> 09:16.560
are made of nested subunits, not only structurally, we all know that we are made of organs made of

09:16.640 --> 09:22.480
tissues, which are made of cells and so on, not just structurally, but actually functionally and

09:23.200 --> 09:29.280
cognitively because there's this evolution uses this multi scale competency architecture,

09:29.280 --> 09:34.960
where every layer solves problems. So from the swarm to the individual animal to the organs to the

09:35.600 --> 09:42.320
cells in the subcellular components, all of these systems solve various kinds of problems in

09:42.320 --> 09:48.880
diverse spaces. Now, what evolution does is reuse some of the same problem solving tricks

09:48.880 --> 09:55.440
in different spaces. Now, we are all very familiar with understanding intelligence when we see it as

09:56.240 --> 10:00.560
operating in three dimensional space, behavioral space. So we see these birds, they know how to

10:00.560 --> 10:04.560
pick up cigarette butts and receive a reward. And we say, okay, that's pretty intelligent,

10:04.560 --> 10:11.120
the bird has learned something. All of our sense organs point outwards. And so we are very familiar

10:11.120 --> 10:16.320
and many animals are very good at detecting agency in the outside world. But if we had

10:16.320 --> 10:23.280
sense organs pointing inwards, let's say a kind of biofeedback where at every step of your life

10:23.280 --> 10:28.960
from childhood, you knew exactly what your liver or your pancreas was doing with respect to what are

10:28.960 --> 10:34.720
the physiological states, what are the actions that it takes, we would then have no problem

10:34.720 --> 10:39.520
recognizing some of their behavior as intelligence. And what I mean by intelligence is simply problem

10:39.520 --> 10:46.320
solving and to move to better regions of some state space. And these spaces might be the space of

10:46.320 --> 10:50.160
all gene expression, of course, these are all very high dimensional spaces, I sort of collapse

10:50.160 --> 10:55.440
everything into two spaces here. But the space of all possible gene expression, morpheus space,

10:55.440 --> 11:01.600
which we'll spend the most of the talk about, which is the space of possible configurations

11:01.600 --> 11:07.280
of the body. So anatomy, anatomical space, and physiological space. There are many examples,

11:07.440 --> 11:10.960
your organs and your cells are solving problems in these spaces all the time.

11:11.600 --> 11:16.800
And we should be humble about the fact that when we look at a system and try to understand

11:16.800 --> 11:23.440
how much and what kind of intelligence it has, we are ourselves taking an IQ test because recognizing

11:23.440 --> 11:29.520
goal directed problem solving behavior in a system requires us to be smart enough to notice it,

11:29.520 --> 11:33.920
to notice the appropriate space, and to understand what is the system doing. And many times when we

11:33.920 --> 11:38.880
don't see that, we need to ask ourselves if we're in fact missing something important.

11:39.680 --> 11:45.040
So one of the things we can say about intelligence in all these spaces is basically that a kind of

11:45.040 --> 11:50.960
a generic statement is basically that it's proportional to the ability to stay out of

11:50.960 --> 11:58.080
local minima, to have a kind of a wider view of what actions you should take. So that, for example,

11:58.080 --> 12:02.960
you know, this from here to here is the most direct path where this dog can get to where it

12:02.960 --> 12:07.520
wants to go. But actually, if it was willing to have some patience and walk away from it for a while,

12:07.520 --> 12:13.200
it could then do much better. And so there's this sort of local energy barrier that the more

12:13.200 --> 12:17.920
intelligent you are, the more you're able to overcome these kinds of things. And one of the

12:17.920 --> 12:24.640
things that we now are able to do with chimeric and bioengineering technologies is take this

12:24.640 --> 12:32.160
multi-scale biological system and replace any, at any level, replace components of this with

12:32.160 --> 12:37.680
new components that might be engineered, and they might be other cells or molecules of other

12:37.680 --> 12:44.480
creatures. And so we can build these composite beings that are not standard issue evolved creatures.

12:44.480 --> 12:52.880
So we can replace any level of organization, we can replace with components that are somewhere

12:52.960 --> 12:57.920
on this scale somewhere between evolved and designed. So maybe they're natural, maybe they're

12:57.920 --> 13:02.720
modified, maybe they're completely engineered, and they will have some degree of intelligence,

13:02.720 --> 13:07.760
maybe they're just pure mechanism in the sense of the very passive mechanisms, or maybe they will

13:07.760 --> 13:14.000
be quite intelligent problem solving components. And already we start to see this, right? So you

13:14.000 --> 13:20.800
have humans with various appliances, so basically early stage cyborgs, we have bioengineered animals,

13:20.800 --> 13:26.080
we have synthetic machines like hybrids, which are brains driving robotic bodies and so on.

13:26.800 --> 13:33.440
And so you can see this at every portion, we can start to replace these components, right,

13:33.440 --> 13:39.200
whether with DNA or with tissues and so on. And all of these are going to be somewhere

13:39.200 --> 13:44.720
on this hierarchy. See, what's important about this is once we start changing all of these things,

13:44.720 --> 13:49.600
we can no longer use the familiar touchstones of phylogeny. We can't say, well, this kind of looks

13:49.600 --> 13:56.000
like a fish, so therefore I expect fish level sophistication of cognition, because all of these

13:56.000 --> 14:02.240
synthetic and we'll come back to this, these synthetic creations are not going to have

14:03.040 --> 14:08.560
origins or components that make it very easy to say what's going on. So we need a kind of

14:08.560 --> 14:14.880
cybernetic understanding of cognition that isn't based on what you're made of or how you got here,

14:14.880 --> 14:19.840
but it's actually based on much deeper principles of what your cognition is like.

14:20.400 --> 14:28.400
And so that is the beginning of how we started thinking about this approach. And

14:29.680 --> 14:33.680
let's talk a little bit about some of the theory now and then we'll get to the data.

14:33.680 --> 14:38.880
So the foundations, and I only say this because I like to make this explicit, you're going to see

14:38.880 --> 14:44.080
all of this in the next sections, but I'd like to make the philosophical

14:44.560 --> 14:49.680
underpinnings of all this completely explicit, so we all know what's going on. Nothing is hidden here.

14:49.680 --> 14:55.360
The first thing is that I think we need to take evolution and developmental biology very seriously,

14:55.360 --> 15:01.920
and that means doing away with binary categories. When we talk, is it really cognitive? Is it just

15:01.920 --> 15:08.240
physics or does it have real memories? There are no sharp categories here. Everything is very

15:08.240 --> 15:14.960
gradual and we'll talk about that. The point here is that we're not trying to anthropomorphize

15:14.960 --> 15:20.880
simple systems. In fact, nowadays, now that we understand evolution and bioengineering,

15:20.880 --> 15:26.080
I'm not sure there's any such thing as anthropomorphizing in the sense that humans have some sort

15:26.080 --> 15:30.880
of magical properties that can be incorrectly attributed to other types of beings. I don't

15:30.880 --> 15:37.280
think that exists. I think as long as you're appropriately scaling your model to whatever

15:37.280 --> 15:42.880
system you're working with and it's giving you empirical advantages, that's how we have to do

15:42.880 --> 15:49.600
this because there's no other way to do it. I'm going to stick very closely to an engineering

15:49.600 --> 15:56.400
approach where I'm not worried about talking about goals in the cybernetic sense. I'm not

15:56.400 --> 16:03.680
talking about trying to avoid attributing too much agency to things because attributing too much

16:03.680 --> 16:09.280
agency is just as bad as not attributing enough to an engineer. These are identical errors.

16:10.560 --> 16:16.000
We'll talk about the fact that agents are a patchwork of multiple unconventional intelligences

16:16.000 --> 16:19.760
at different levels. I don't believe there's any magic in the material. There's nothing really

16:19.760 --> 16:25.040
magic about synapses or protoplasm or anything else. We're going to be material independent

16:25.040 --> 16:31.680
here. I really want to understand biology, which Chris Langton refers to as life as it can be.

16:32.240 --> 16:35.920
Not zoology, not just the types of plants and animals we have here now, but actually

16:39.360 --> 16:44.560
what's unique and important about all cognitive systems. One of the things that

16:46.000 --> 16:53.120
this framework does from an engineering perspective is simply say that there's a

16:53.120 --> 17:01.200
continuum, a smooth continuum with some waypoints along this journey, where the way that you

17:01.920 --> 17:08.640
understand the cognitive capacity of whatever system you're dealing with is really defined by

17:08.640 --> 17:15.040
what is the most efficient, most optimal way to interact with that system, the way to

17:15.040 --> 17:20.560
change the way the system functions. If you're dealing with a certain class of hardware systems,

17:20.560 --> 17:25.760
like clocks, for example, your only option is modification of the hardware at the lowest level.

17:25.760 --> 17:29.600
You're not going to teach it anything. You're not going to convince it of anything. Hardware

17:29.600 --> 17:35.280
modification is your only option. Then there's a more interesting class of devices like

17:35.280 --> 17:43.280
thermostats, which are a little further along because they have an encoded setpoint. They spend

17:43.280 --> 17:49.760
energy to maintain a specific goal state, and you can interact with them in a very interesting way.

17:49.760 --> 17:55.440
You can rewrite or alter the goal state, and then the machine will now pursue that goal,

17:55.440 --> 17:59.440
let's say a different temperature range, without you having to rewire the hardware. You don't have

17:59.440 --> 18:02.800
to change the hardware of the system. In fact, you don't even have to know about the hardware.

18:02.800 --> 18:06.560
You don't have to know how it works. As long as you know what the setpoint is,

18:06.560 --> 18:12.640
you can recognize where it's encoded and so on. Then there's a whole other class of systems

18:13.600 --> 18:19.360
like this, where you actually need to know even less about what's going on because you can train

18:19.360 --> 18:24.480
them. Human beings have been training animals for thousands of years without knowing any neuroscience,

18:24.560 --> 18:31.280
because they appreciated the important fact that systems like this can be modified based on

18:31.280 --> 18:35.600
stimuli, based on rewards and punishments, and you can actually rely on the system itself to

18:35.600 --> 18:41.840
reconfigure its own internal mechanisms in terms of plasticity and various other things,

18:41.840 --> 18:44.640
and you don't need to do that. You don't need to micromanage it. You don't even need to know

18:44.640 --> 18:48.640
how it works. You just need to understand how to motivate the system, how to communicate with the

18:48.640 --> 18:53.760
system. Then we get to some very advanced creatures here, where you can actually communicate not

18:53.760 --> 18:59.360
simply with rewards and punishments but actually with cogent reasons for doing things. This is a

18:59.360 --> 19:04.720
very engineering approach because the idea is not to have philosophical feelings about whether

19:04.720 --> 19:09.520
thermostats do or do not have real desires. The point is actually for any given system,

19:09.520 --> 19:17.680
well in any given let's say novel biological or novel engineered system, the task is very simple.

19:17.680 --> 19:22.720
Which kind of model gives you the best prediction of control? Using these kind of models on these

19:22.720 --> 19:30.400
systems will give you nothing of use, but actually using these kind of models on sophisticated systems

19:30.400 --> 19:34.320
actually leaves a lot on the table as far as capabilities, and this is one of the limitations

19:34.320 --> 19:41.200
of modern molecular medicine, is that the assumption is that everything is a piece of passive

19:41.200 --> 19:45.360
hardware like this and must be dealt with at the hardware level. Genomic editing,

19:47.120 --> 19:51.600
rewiring, pathways, protein engineering, everything is focused on the hardware. We've

19:51.600 --> 19:56.480
actually done a lot of work showing that some of these other approaches are much more powerful

19:56.480 --> 20:01.520
in medical kinds of circumstances where you're trying to get the system to do something complex.

20:05.840 --> 20:12.240
One way to think about how all of these different very diverse types of systems can be related to

20:12.240 --> 20:17.520
each other is simply to try to map, and again I've collapsed space into one dimension. This is

20:17.520 --> 20:24.160
almost like an Minkowski kind of diagram where we can plot on a diagram of space and time what is

20:24.160 --> 20:30.320
the scale of the goals that a given system is able to pursue. Now remember this is not a diagram of

20:30.320 --> 20:36.160
how far a system can sense or how far away it can act, but actually the size of the goals that a

20:36.160 --> 20:40.640
system is able to pursue. So if you're a bacterium or something or a tick or something like that,

20:40.640 --> 20:45.840
you are only interested in very local concentrations of certain compounds. You may have a little bit

20:45.840 --> 20:49.360
of memory going backwards, you may have a little predictive capacity going forwards,

20:49.360 --> 20:56.240
but everything you're doing is in a very small radius of goal-directed activity. You're only

20:56.240 --> 21:01.440
interested in very local things, and in fact you're not capable of caring about things that are very

21:01.440 --> 21:06.800
far away. So it forms a kind of cognitive light cone of the things that your cognitive system is

21:06.800 --> 21:12.400
capable of doing, and so we can think about other animals that may have some pretty good memory going

21:12.400 --> 21:18.560
backwards, a little bit of predictive capacity going forwards, but still unable to really care

21:18.560 --> 21:22.560
about things that are going to happen two months from now in the next town. It's just impossible

21:22.560 --> 21:26.960
for some of these, but if you're a human, for example, you might have an enormous light cone.

21:26.960 --> 21:32.240
In fact, uniquely among animals, you might care about things that will for sure take longer than

21:32.240 --> 21:38.080
your lifespan. Some of your goals are actually not achievable because your lifespan is not as

21:38.080 --> 21:43.760
big as your goal space, and then we can imagine all sorts of other shapes for possible alien or

21:43.760 --> 21:48.880
synthetic kinds of creatures, and of course, all of this is nested. So we are a patchwork of

21:49.520 --> 21:54.880
modules within modules, each of which is capable, whether in physiological space or anatomical space

21:54.880 --> 22:00.480
or behavioral space, contain various sizes of goals, very large, very small, and so on.

22:00.480 --> 22:06.960
Now, what's really interesting is that the scale of these cells can change quite rapidly.

22:06.960 --> 22:12.000
So here, this is one cell. This is a lacrimaria. There's no brain. There's no nervous system.

22:12.000 --> 22:18.160
This is one cell that is handling all of its anatomical, physiological, behavioral, metabolic

22:18.160 --> 22:24.720
needs at the level of a single cell. Now, these cells, you know, relatives of these single cells

22:24.720 --> 22:30.960
can collaborate together to work on very large things. Here, you see a multicellular body.

22:30.960 --> 22:36.000
This is a salamander. If you amputate the limb, the cells immediately begin to grow. They will

22:36.000 --> 22:41.120
continue to grow and shape a new limb until it's complete, and then they stop. So we'll talk in

22:41.120 --> 22:46.880
a minute about what this is. This is an anatomical homeostasis where the setpoint is very large. All

22:46.880 --> 22:53.840
of these cells are solving a problem in anatomical space. They start out in a region of anatomical

22:53.840 --> 22:57.200
space that's not good. They want to get to the much better region. That is their goal,

22:57.200 --> 23:02.400
and they know how to, the collective is able to get there. So that's the scaling of goals that

23:02.480 --> 23:06.880
occurs during evolution, but there's actually a reduction that takes place, and we call that cancer.

23:06.880 --> 23:12.800
So what happens is when individual cells, and this is a human glioblastoma, when individual cells

23:12.800 --> 23:16.880
become disconnected, functionally disconnected, I'll show you how this works, functionally

23:16.880 --> 23:22.720
disconnected from these large-scale goals, they revert back to an ancient unicellular amoeba-like

23:22.720 --> 23:28.000
lifestyle where their only goals are to reproduce and to optimize certain metabolic functions,

23:28.000 --> 23:33.200
which means migrate wherever life is good. So the boundary between self and world,

23:33.760 --> 23:38.080
in this case, these cells basically treat the rest of the body as just an external environment.

23:38.080 --> 23:43.840
They're not more selfish than any other biological construct. They're equally selfish,

23:43.840 --> 23:48.480
just that the self is not very small. So that boundary between self and world can grow and

23:48.480 --> 23:54.320
shrink. And so the way you can schematize it is simply this, that you have individual cells,

23:54.320 --> 23:59.360
and this takes place at many layers. I'm just going to introduce this with this example of cells.

23:59.360 --> 24:09.440
So individual cells have some degree of being able to compute and remember and make predictions about

24:09.440 --> 24:15.760
states of their local environment. But when they join into networks, these, and in particular,

24:15.760 --> 24:20.480
I'm going to talk about electrical networks, these networks are actually have a lot, have higher IQ.

24:20.480 --> 24:26.720
They're not only measuring information from wider spatial areas, meaning they're

24:26.720 --> 24:31.840
integrating lots of signal spatially, but they actually have higher computational capacity,

24:31.840 --> 24:38.080
and they're able to have larger scale goals. And so this is what we see. You can sort of

24:38.080 --> 24:45.840
track the width and space and time of what these cells are concerned with. And here's a very important

24:46.800 --> 24:56.160
component of this, which is stress, this idea that what stresses different kind of agents

24:56.160 --> 25:02.400
is basically a delta between your goal states and the state you're in now. Stress is what drives you

25:02.400 --> 25:06.880
to make changes, whether it be through gene expression or physiology or behavior, to get

25:06.880 --> 25:11.600
closer to your goals. So stress is a kind of metric. But what's very interesting about stress

25:12.320 --> 25:18.000
isn't just that delta, stress is the ability to export that delta to your neighbors.

25:18.000 --> 25:24.800
So the idea is that all of these cells are able to measure states much larger than what

25:24.800 --> 25:32.080
individual cells can care about, and thus reduce the delta for much more complex states.

25:32.080 --> 25:37.520
So one can say that if you tell me what you're stressed about, I can make a pretty good guess

25:37.520 --> 25:43.040
about your cognitive sophistication. So if the most complicated thing that could possibly stress

25:43.040 --> 25:48.000
you is local glucose level, then you're probably something like a bacterium. If you're stressed

25:48.000 --> 25:55.120
about the state of the economy on earth, then you're probably a human level or above. Being able

25:55.120 --> 26:01.920
to be stressed by complex large scales of events is a very strong driver of sophistication. And so

26:01.920 --> 26:08.640
what you can see, now let's look at some data here. What you can do is you can introduce oncogenes,

26:08.640 --> 26:14.000
in particular human oncogenes, into normal cells in this frog embryo. This is a tadpole. So here's

26:14.000 --> 26:19.520
the eye, here's the gut, the spinal cord is back here. So we can introduce these oncogenes.

26:19.520 --> 26:24.080
And what you can see, the first thing that happens when these oncogenes are active is they

26:24.080 --> 26:29.040
cause the cells to detach electrically from their neighbors and to enter an aberrant bioelectrical

26:29.040 --> 26:33.600
state. This is a voltage map, and I'll show you in a minute, we use this a lot. We map the electrical

26:33.600 --> 26:40.240
state of these cells. And here they are, you can actually catch them converting to this kind of

26:40.240 --> 26:46.800
ancient amoeba-like state. And the most important thing is that you can actually suppress this

26:46.800 --> 26:51.760
process, despite the fact that the oncogene is there. If you grab control of the bioelectric

26:51.760 --> 26:57.280
state of the cell by co-injecting an ion channel, that's going to, even though the oncogene is very

26:57.280 --> 27:03.840
strongly expressed, there may be no tumor because you're managing the goals that these cells are

27:03.840 --> 27:08.000
going to follow. They are now connected to their neighbors, and they're all working towards making

27:08.000 --> 27:15.680
a nice skin muscle and everything else. One of the most important things that evolution discovered

27:15.680 --> 27:23.600
to do that is this thing called a gap junction. So gap junction is this, it's a primitive synapse,

27:23.600 --> 27:30.320
it's an electrical synapse used throughout the body that enables cells to directly communicate

27:30.320 --> 27:37.760
with each other to directly connect their intercellular miliars. And what that means is that

27:38.640 --> 27:43.440
traditional signaling like this, you have one cell and it produces some kind of signaling factor,

27:43.440 --> 27:51.440
and it diffuses and this cell can feel it. It's very easy for these cells to remain separate

27:51.440 --> 27:55.200
and keep their identity because once you receive a signal like this, you know it came from the

27:55.200 --> 28:01.600
outside. And so you can ignore it, you can remember it or you can not remember it. This

28:01.600 --> 28:05.920
cell has its set of memories and this cell has its set of memories about past events that have

28:05.920 --> 28:10.720
happened, and it's very easy for them to be separate. But once cells become coupled by these

28:10.720 --> 28:15.760
gap junctions, something very interesting happens, the information that comes across does not have

28:15.760 --> 28:21.040
any metadata about the owner. So anything that happens to this cell that triggers some kind of

28:21.440 --> 28:26.080
second messenger response that serves as a memory engram of that experience,

28:26.080 --> 28:32.000
once that propagates into this cell, this cell now has no way to tell whether that information

28:32.000 --> 28:39.440
originated related to this cell or in fact it came from this cell. So all of the experiences

28:39.440 --> 28:45.840
and prior history of this cell are now shared by them both. They cannot separate who's who,

28:45.840 --> 28:51.760
it's a kind of mind meld, so to speak, because their internal miliures are linked in an important

28:51.760 --> 28:57.760
way. And so now a lot of their individuality is really stripped, right? You now get this one

28:58.400 --> 29:04.400
system with a larger network, larger IQ, lots of memory of what happened to both cells,

29:04.400 --> 29:09.920
but it's no longer possible to keep that very strict separation and this is how goals scale.

29:09.920 --> 29:16.800
So what you can do, and we're making some very rigorous models of this, is you can start with

29:16.800 --> 29:21.600
very simple homeostatic loops, single cells, all they do, let's say pH, right? All they do is they

29:21.600 --> 29:26.240
sort of, they measure the pH, they compare to set point, and then they either load, acid load,

29:26.240 --> 29:30.960
or efflux, that's it. And so these very small, very humble goals, once you start connecting

29:30.960 --> 29:36.000
these cells by gap junctions, you have a bioelectrical medium, you have this excitable medium

29:36.000 --> 29:41.920
that's able to store and process very large states as goals. And this is something that's

29:41.920 --> 29:47.120
been worked a lot in Hopfield Networks and other kinds of systems. So we are making those kind

29:47.120 --> 29:53.920
of models to understand large scale memories, in particular pattern memories, as a scaling of

29:53.920 --> 29:59.360
simple homeostatic units in electrical networks, right? It's a kind of a connectionist approach.

29:59.360 --> 30:03.760
So let's look at some real data and let's see what you can do with all this.

30:03.760 --> 30:08.560
And so we'll do two things. We'll talk about morphogenesis as a collective intelligence,

30:08.560 --> 30:13.680
and then we'll look at this novel proto-organism, okay? And we're going to try to understand

30:13.680 --> 30:18.080
how these goal memories are actually stored and processed, so the mechanisms

30:18.080 --> 30:24.000
by which collective intelligences of cells store set point information. So the first thing

30:24.800 --> 30:30.240
I just want to mention is that there are, there's huge plasticity in living things,

30:30.240 --> 30:36.320
which has really important implications for evolution. This is a tadpole that we've made.

30:36.320 --> 30:40.080
There are no eyes in the primary where they're supposed to go. So these are nostrils, here's

30:40.080 --> 30:44.640
the brain, here's the gut. So what we've done is we suppressed the primary eyes, but we've,

30:44.640 --> 30:48.320
we induced an eye on the tail, and we can have a separate discussion about how we do that,

30:48.320 --> 30:54.080
we do that through the techniques that I'm talking about today. We induce the eye on the tail,

30:54.080 --> 30:58.160
and we have this machine that tests these animals for visual learning and basically trains them for

30:58.160 --> 31:03.040
certain behaviors and visual cues. We find out that these animals can see perfectly well.

31:04.240 --> 31:09.360
This eye synapses onto the spinal cord, not the brain, and their behavior is quite normal.

31:09.360 --> 31:13.760
They can learn, they can see, they have very nice, very nice visual behaviors,

31:13.760 --> 31:26.960
and so what this means is that the ability of evolution to explore the various configurations

31:27.040 --> 31:31.600
is greatly potentiated by the fact that if things happen, let's say there's a mutation that moves

31:31.600 --> 31:37.600
the eye, no problem, your behavioral repertoire doesn't automatically fall apart such that now

31:37.600 --> 31:42.480
your fitness is very low. In fact, the animal can, the animal can still function, and then you can

31:42.480 --> 31:50.160
explore other consequences of that mutation. So this is really important, and this ability,

31:50.160 --> 31:54.640
this plasticity, and this ability to handle novel circumstances, that's the key here,

31:54.640 --> 31:59.680
is the novelty. This animal evolved for millions of years to process visual input from the eye

31:59.680 --> 32:06.400
fields, but one changed and it can handle this. This is another example of problem solving in

32:06.400 --> 32:11.600
physiological space. So here's a flatworm, these are plenarium, I'm going to show you much more

32:11.600 --> 32:17.440
of this. These flatworms have this amazing property of regeneration. So if you cut off their heads,

32:17.440 --> 32:22.000
for example, they will regrow a new head. In fact, they regrow everything. So what we found is that

32:22.000 --> 32:27.920
if you take one of these plenarians and you expose them to barium chloride, so barium is a non-specific

32:27.920 --> 32:33.520
potassium channel blocker, it's a really bad problem because now these cells can't pass potassium.

32:33.520 --> 32:39.200
So the heads of these plenaria literally explode. Overnight they just go head deep

32:39.200 --> 32:43.840
progression, they literally explode. But what's incredible is that over the next couple of weeks,

32:43.840 --> 32:49.200
if you leave the animal in the barium, they will regrow brand new heads that are completely normal,

32:49.200 --> 32:54.400
that are barium adapted. They have no problem with barium whatsoever. So what we did was we

32:54.400 --> 33:00.400
did some transcriptomic analysis to simply ask the question, what new genes are expressed in

33:00.400 --> 33:05.120
these animals that are not expressed in these animals? How is it that they're barium adapted?

33:05.120 --> 33:10.000
What happened? And it turns out it's actually a very small number of genes that was changed

33:10.000 --> 33:16.320
in order to do this. So now think about the critical part here is two things. One is that

33:16.320 --> 33:21.040
barium is not anything that plenaria find in nature. So there's never been evolutionary selection

33:22.320 --> 33:26.960
to put up with barium. That's a completely novel. And the other thing is that cells in the system

33:26.960 --> 33:32.160
don't reproduce quickly the way bacteria do. So you can't use some sort of a selectionist

33:32.160 --> 33:36.800
explanation that basically everybody tries random sets of gene expression and whoever survives,

33:36.800 --> 33:40.400
repopulates the head. There's no time for that. These cells don't turn over that fast.

33:40.400 --> 33:45.120
So it's almost a problem here. Think about this problem. You have tens of thousands of different

33:45.120 --> 33:51.040
genes that you can turn on and off. I visualize this as a nuclear reactor control room. Your cells

33:51.040 --> 33:56.000
are poisoned. You have this physiological stressor. The cells are poisoned. Everything's melting down.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.320
You have to find a very small number of genes that you're going to up and down regulate to solve

34:00.320 --> 34:05.440
this problem. You've never seen this problem before. How do you know which genes you're going

34:05.440 --> 34:09.920
to turn on and off? And so part of that might be some sort of generalization from other problems

34:09.920 --> 34:14.720
you've had that may have been similar. For example, excitotoxicity, epilepsy, things like

34:14.800 --> 34:21.040
that may be similar to this, but it requires an incredible amount of problem-solving ability to

34:21.040 --> 34:26.880
navigate that transcriptional space, that space of all gene expression, to find exactly what you're

34:26.880 --> 34:34.960
looking for. So that's an example in physiology. Now let's look at examples in anatomy. So this

34:34.960 --> 34:42.720
here is a cross-section through the kidney tubule of a nut of a salamander. And if you look, the

34:42.720 --> 34:50.880
normal tubule has eight to 10 cells or so that work together to build a lumen of a particular

34:50.880 --> 34:56.640
size. These tubules have a particular diameter. What you can do is you can make these nuts with

34:56.640 --> 35:01.520
progressively larger cells. And you do that by inducing extra copy numbers of their chromosomes.

35:02.240 --> 35:05.920
Amazingly, the cells put up with it and they just simply get bigger. The cells get bigger.

35:05.920 --> 35:10.800
As the cells get bigger, what you will see, and this isn't our work. This goes back to the 40s,

35:10.880 --> 35:17.600
what you will see is that fewer and fewer cells are now working together to make basically the

35:17.600 --> 35:22.880
same size lumen. So they're adjusting the number of cells based on this really novel and unexpected

35:22.880 --> 35:29.600
outcome of having to build a salamander with much larger bricks. So if we had robotics building

35:29.600 --> 35:33.840
something, you could give it a completely different size of brick and it would make adjustments and

35:33.840 --> 35:37.680
things would still work. We don't have anything like that. The most amazing part of this is that

35:38.400 --> 35:43.440
if you make cells that are truly enormous, what will happen is just one cell will bend

35:43.440 --> 35:49.440
around itself and achieve the same outcome. So completely different molecular mechanisms,

35:49.440 --> 35:56.400
not cell-to-cell communication, but now cytoskeletal bending that gets you to the same place using a

35:56.400 --> 36:03.840
different set of molecular components in service of a large-scale anatomical feature. So this is

36:03.840 --> 36:12.080
very much looks like a kind of top-down control where the goal of making a tubule can be implemented

36:12.080 --> 36:17.360
with diverse, it's got that degeneracy, it can be implemented with diverse molecular mechanisms

36:17.360 --> 36:25.360
and the system executes whatever it needs at the lower levels to maintain the correct region of

36:25.360 --> 36:30.080
anatomical space at the higher levels. We don't understand how this works, but it fits nicely

36:30.160 --> 36:35.440
William James' definition of intelligence, which is same goal through different means,

36:35.440 --> 36:40.640
the ability to reach your goal when things are changing, including in this case, not just changes

36:40.640 --> 36:45.840
of external environment, but changes of your own components. Your cells are now way bigger than

36:45.840 --> 36:50.320
evolution prepared you for and you can still do what you need to do. Here's another example,

36:50.320 --> 36:56.000
this is a frog. Frogs, unlike salamanders, normally do not regenerate their legs and so

36:56.800 --> 37:02.880
what we've done is in some of our work that aims towards regenerative medicine, we've figured out

37:02.880 --> 37:06.720
how to make them regenerate their legs. When you do that, something very interesting happens. This

37:06.720 --> 37:13.040
is an early leg. Here's a toenail, here's some toes. These early legs don't look anything like

37:13.040 --> 37:18.480
the way that legs normally develop. Eventually, they get to the same place and they make a very

37:18.480 --> 37:24.080
nice frog leg at the end, but the intermediate paths are not like developmental strategies at

37:24.160 --> 37:28.720
all. In fact, they look kind of like a plant really. It's just a different way to navigate

37:28.720 --> 37:33.440
morpho space to get to the same outcome. What you see here is the biology has this incredible

37:33.440 --> 37:40.480
plasticity of behavior, of physiology, and of anatomical construction to get to the same goals

37:41.440 --> 37:46.480
via very different paths and as I'm going to show you in a minute, also from diverse starting

37:46.480 --> 37:52.160
positions. That plasticity, that intelligence of these systems is really important to understand

37:52.160 --> 37:57.680
and as we think about shape, we have a very basic question. Where is anatomy specified in the first

37:57.680 --> 38:04.160
place? You start life as a collection of blastomeres, your bunch of cells descended from the egg and

38:05.280 --> 38:10.320
this is a cross-section of a human torso. This is amazing. Look at this incredible and variant

38:10.320 --> 38:15.680
order. All of the cells, the organs, everything is in the right position, the right orientation,

38:16.240 --> 38:30.560
the right location relative to each other. How does it know where these things should actually go?

38:30.560 --> 38:37.200
People naturally say the genome, but of course, we know how to read genomes now and what's in

38:37.200 --> 38:42.480
the genome is the specification of the micro-level hardware. DNA specifies the proteins. There's

38:42.480 --> 38:47.680
nothing in the genome that directly talks about anatomical size, shape, symmetry type. It's all

38:47.680 --> 38:53.680
about the micro-level hardware. We need to understand how does this order arise? We need to understand

38:53.680 --> 39:02.480
if part of it is missing. How do we repair or edit this? How do we get the cells to rebuild?

39:02.480 --> 39:07.440
And then as engineers, we want to go one step further and ask, well, what else could these cells

39:07.440 --> 39:11.280
build and how could we convince them to build something completely different than their default

39:11.280 --> 39:16.880
outcome? And so I've already shown you this, that these individual cells are very competent

39:16.880 --> 39:23.760
on their individual cell scale, but it gets much more interesting in examples like this.

39:24.480 --> 39:28.560
This here, what you're seeing here is that this is a normal tappel. So here are the eyes, here's

39:28.560 --> 39:33.520
the brain, here's the gut, and these tappels need to become a frog. In order for a tappel to become

39:33.520 --> 39:38.400
a frog, they have to rearrange their face. So this means that they have to move their jaws,

39:38.480 --> 39:42.720
have to move forward, their eyes have to move inward, everything has to move. And it was thought

39:42.720 --> 39:49.280
previously that somehow the genetics basically tells each organ the direction and the amount to

39:49.280 --> 39:54.400
move because then you can always go from a standard tappel to a standard frog. So what we did was we

39:54.400 --> 39:59.040
made these, we call them Picasso frogs. They are completely mixed up. Everything is in the wrong

39:59.040 --> 40:04.560
place. The jaws are off to the side. The eyes are on the back of the head. Everything is moved

40:04.560 --> 40:09.200
around. And when you do this, what you find out is that they still make largely quite normal

40:09.200 --> 40:14.400
frogs because all of these organs will move around in unnatural paths. In fact, sometimes

40:14.400 --> 40:18.960
they go too far and they actually have to have to come back. They will keep moving until a correct

40:18.960 --> 40:24.960
frog face is built. So what the system actually does is the genetics doesn't specify the movements.

40:24.960 --> 40:33.760
The genetics specifies the seed that constructs a machine that minimizes error. It's able to,

40:33.760 --> 40:38.240
from novel starting configurations, it's progressively able to minimize the delta

40:38.240 --> 40:41.920
between where we are now and what the correct face is, which obviously raises some important

40:41.920 --> 40:47.920
questions. How does it know what the correct frog face looks like? So in my group, what we've been

40:47.920 --> 40:54.000
doing is this is kind of the standard model of developmental biology where you have gene

40:54.560 --> 40:59.440
regulatory networks that turn each other on and off. Some of these genes make proteins that are

40:59.440 --> 41:03.360
sticky or they diffuse or they're doing various things. So then there's this parallel physics

41:03.360 --> 41:09.040
that goes on and then there's this process of emergence where if lots of individual pieces

41:09.040 --> 41:14.160
do execute these local rules, then eventually something very complex happens like this nice

41:14.160 --> 41:19.200
style manner. So this is all true. This is all happens. Of course, there is a feed forward,

41:19.200 --> 41:24.960
a emergent component to this, but there's actually also a very important set of feedbacks

41:24.960 --> 41:28.880
that occur both at the level of physics and genetics and we're going to talk about the

41:28.880 --> 41:36.160
physical one here today that basically executes a loop of anatomical homeostasis

41:36.160 --> 41:41.200
when the system is perturbed from its normal target morphology and this might be with injury,

41:41.200 --> 41:49.440
with pre-cancerous conversions, with teratogens, mutation, anything that takes the system away

41:49.440 --> 41:56.960
from that's correct shape kick starts cascades that will try to get back to the correct location

41:57.520 --> 42:04.400
in morpho space. So what we needed to know was can we find the storage mechanism for the set

42:04.400 --> 42:08.560
point, right? Every homeostatic process has a set point and so what you want to do is you want to

42:08.560 --> 42:13.200
find the storage mechanism of the set point and you want to know how to change it. Can we learn

42:13.200 --> 42:18.160
to read and write these set points and this is very important for the kind of biomedical approaches

42:18.160 --> 42:24.480
that we're really focused on in my group because making changes here, which is what all of molecular

42:24.480 --> 42:30.560
medicine tries to do is to make changes somewhere down here is incredibly difficult as a means of

42:30.560 --> 42:35.040
changing what we really care about which is anatomy, which is solving birth defects and

42:35.040 --> 42:40.800
traumatic injury and aging and things like this because reversing this to be able to decide what

42:40.800 --> 42:44.720
changes do you need to make is incredibly hard. This is an inverse problem that's probably

42:44.720 --> 42:51.600
unsolvable to try to in general to try to reverse this highly non-linear highly recursive process

42:51.600 --> 42:56.800
to say what do I need to do at the micro level to get me to a desired system level state.

42:57.520 --> 43:01.040
So what we would like to do is we'd like to change the set point, leave all of this intact. The cells

43:01.040 --> 43:05.520
are very good at implementing different set points. We just like to change the set points. So where is

43:05.520 --> 43:12.080
it encoded? So we took our inspiration from the brain. We know how this works in brain brains are

43:12.080 --> 43:18.000
an excellent system for maintaining behavioral set points and being intelligent about getting to

43:18.080 --> 43:23.360
those set points. So we said, how does this work in the brain? Well, in the brain, you've got some

43:23.360 --> 43:30.000
cellular hardware that basically is a set of electrical networks that is the home of the

43:30.880 --> 43:35.200
interesting electrical dynamics, which you might call the software because it's able to be changed

43:35.200 --> 43:40.160
by experience and so on. And what people in neuroscience are doing is this project called

43:40.160 --> 43:46.000
neural decoding. So the commitment is that if you were to read and be able to decode all of the

43:46.000 --> 43:51.440
electrical activity in the brain, you could infer the the memories, the preferences, the

43:51.440 --> 43:55.360
goal states, you know, that's where it's all encoded. It's all encoded in the electrochemical

43:55.360 --> 44:00.160
dynamics of what this hardware is doing. And what the nervous system is using all this for is to

44:00.160 --> 44:04.160
coordinate muscles in three dimensional space so that you can move around and do various things.

44:04.880 --> 44:08.720
What did evolution, where did this come from? You know, in evolution, this is a brain didn't

44:08.720 --> 44:12.800
just appear out of nowhere. These electrical systems are actually ancient, even bacterial

44:12.800 --> 44:17.600
biofilms have all of this stuff. So what did this look like before we had brains before we had

44:17.600 --> 44:26.000
muscles for large scale behavior? It looked actually surprisingly similar. It we have the

44:26.000 --> 44:31.280
exact same scheme. So you have all cells in the body are actually producing these these electrical

44:31.280 --> 44:36.880
dynamics through the network. And what you can do and this is a video of a early frog embryo,

44:36.880 --> 44:40.400
we're tracking the voltage, this is not a model or a simulation, this is real data,

44:40.400 --> 44:44.720
you're looking at all the electrical dynamics, as you might when you look at a brain,

44:44.720 --> 44:49.600
that we could try to read and we could test the hypothesis that these electrical dynamics

44:49.600 --> 44:53.840
are the medium in which the collective intelligence of these cells is making decisions,

44:53.840 --> 44:57.680
who's going to be anterior, posterior, left, right, how many heads do we have and things like

44:57.680 --> 45:02.720
that. So it's a very parallel project to what neuroscience is doing, but taken away from sort

45:02.720 --> 45:08.880
of generalized away from neurons and asked about all cells. So just again, to nail this down,

45:08.880 --> 45:12.880
all cells, this is developmental bio electricity, all cells have ion channels,

45:12.880 --> 45:18.000
all cells set electrical resting potentials, they communicate those through gap junctions,

45:18.000 --> 45:23.920
which we met a few slides ago, that can communicate them through to their to their neighbors using

45:23.920 --> 45:31.840
the exact same mechanisms. And here you can you can read about how we think that that that

45:31.840 --> 45:38.400
coordinating problems in morphospace was the basis of intelligence in behavior when evolution

45:38.400 --> 45:44.880
pivoted from just coordinating the body shape to actually running around in three dimensional

45:44.880 --> 45:51.840
space by using muscles and sense organs and things like that. So let's let's think about

45:52.480 --> 45:58.800
how then if I'm making the claim that that these bio electrical patterns are a kind of cognitive

45:58.800 --> 46:03.520
proto cognitive medium for making decisions in anatomical space and I'm just going to show you

46:03.520 --> 46:07.920
want some examples of that. So here's our planarian, here's the flatworm, here are the eyes, the head,

46:07.920 --> 46:12.960
here's the tail. What we can do is we can first ask, let's look at gene expression, which of these

46:12.960 --> 46:16.800
cells think they're part of the head? Well, it's this one, these blue cells here, right? So there's

46:16.800 --> 46:20.640
anterior gene expression in the head, there's none in the tail, that's very good. So it's supposed

46:20.640 --> 46:26.400
to be when you cut off the head and the tail, this middle fragment remembers exactly what goes at

46:26.400 --> 46:32.240
each end and pretty soon you have a new planarian, one head, one tail, fine. Now here's another planarian,

46:32.240 --> 46:37.760
again, one head, one tail, again, anterior gene expression in the in the head, that's fine.

46:37.760 --> 46:42.800
When you cut this guy, you get something amazing, which is a two headed form. Now this is not photoshop,

46:42.800 --> 46:48.160
these are these are real animals. Now, why would this animal with normal gene expression and normal

46:48.160 --> 46:53.600
anatomy, why would this animal suddenly, by the way, this process is 100% of fidelity, you know,

46:53.600 --> 46:58.480
it's habit, it's very hard to make them make a mistake, they always basically do this correctly.

46:58.480 --> 47:04.160
Why would they suddenly make a two headed animal? Because in the meantime, what we did was we looked

47:04.160 --> 47:11.120
at a bioelectrical circuit that, oops, that we looked at this, this bioelectrical circuit,

47:11.120 --> 47:17.520
and we realized that there might be some, there might be a gradient, some electrical communication

47:17.520 --> 47:23.760
that allows these cells to remember how many heads they're supposed to have and where the heads go.

47:23.760 --> 47:28.560
And so what we did was we learned to, to, to suppress this, and this is not with applied

47:28.560 --> 47:34.960
electric fields or magnets or anything like that, this is by using RNA interference and specific

47:34.960 --> 47:42.000
drugs to target ion channels, target the native machinery by which these cells produce the voltage

47:42.000 --> 47:50.640
gradients. And what we found is that these animals actually make two headed to these,

47:50.640 --> 47:54.640
these, what, once, once the electric circuit is perturbed in a very specific way,

47:54.640 --> 47:59.040
actually make two headed animals. And one of the most amazing aspects of these,

47:59.760 --> 48:03.520
of these two headed animals is that, and I keep calling this a memory, here's why,

48:03.520 --> 48:08.560
if you were to recut this animal again, in plain water, no more manipulations of any kind. So

48:09.600 --> 48:14.640
you chop off the primary head, you get rid of this ectopic secondary head, if you thought some of

48:14.640 --> 48:19.200
these cells were, you know, epigenetically reprogrammed to be ahead, fine, they, we throw them away,

48:19.200 --> 48:23.680
all we leave is this nice normal gut fragment. And that was nothing weird about that, about

48:23.680 --> 48:28.240
this gut fragment that the genetics are unchanged. And so you might think that it should just

48:28.240 --> 48:33.040
regenerate a normal planarian, but that's not what happens. They regenerate these two headed

48:33.040 --> 48:37.600
forms. And if you cut those, they still regenerate as two headed forms. And this is basically

48:37.600 --> 48:43.040
permanent. And we now know how to change that circuit back with a, with another brief, bi-electrical

48:44.000 --> 48:50.000
drug stimulation, change it back to being one headed. So the question of how many heads a

48:50.000 --> 48:56.000
planarian has, or is supposed to have, is quite interesting. The default that, that the hardware

48:56.000 --> 49:00.720
specified by the genome will make is one, but that's not really where the information is stored.

49:00.720 --> 49:06.000
The information is stored, as I'll show you momentarily, in the real time electrical state of a

49:06.000 --> 49:11.040
circuit that tells these cells what the target morphology of a correct planarian is. It is the

49:11.040 --> 49:15.040
set point. And that set point is not genetic. The genetics here are untouched. We didn't edit

49:15.040 --> 49:22.160
the genome or anything like that. We, we changed the encoding of what the correct state is

49:23.280 --> 49:28.000
considered by these cells when they are injured. And so this meets all the properties of memory.

49:28.000 --> 49:33.680
It's long-term stable. It's rewritable. It has conditional recall, which looks like this. So

49:34.480 --> 49:39.360
the reason that, that this guy made a two headed animal is that we looked at the bi-electrical

49:39.360 --> 49:44.560
circuit. Here's what a normal one state looks like. The voltage here just tells you one head.

49:44.560 --> 49:48.560
And what we did was we altered it. And it's a little messy. The technology is still being worked

49:48.560 --> 49:54.880
out. But basically what we did was we induced a different pattern memory in the exact same kind

49:54.880 --> 50:00.880
of body. So this says when you are injured, you will build to the target morphology. And this

50:00.880 --> 50:05.920
is what the correct planarian target morphology looks like. Make two heads. And that's what it does.

50:05.920 --> 50:12.720
So to be super clear, this electrical map is not the memory of this existing animal.

50:12.720 --> 50:18.800
This is a memory of this one headed animal. So a one headed body, a normal, a normal body can

50:18.800 --> 50:24.000
store at least one of two different representations of what a correct planarian should look like.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.480
So this is what I mean when I say the bi-electrical state is the

50:27.200 --> 50:31.840
protocognitive medium of this collective intelligence. The cells are literally keeping

50:31.840 --> 50:35.600
a representation, a visible, I mean, we can read this now and we can rewrite it,

50:35.600 --> 50:40.880
a visible bi-electric representation of what they should do if they get injured. Until they get

50:40.880 --> 50:45.120
injured, this pattern is ignored. It's a latent memory. It doesn't do anything. Once it gets injured,

50:45.120 --> 50:49.680
then you see what it is because it guides them to make this two headed one. Now,

50:50.320 --> 50:55.840
this kind of approach can make ectopic heads of the same species. And that's kind of

50:56.720 --> 51:01.040
sufficiently surprising. But we can go further than this. And it turns out that what you can

51:01.040 --> 51:08.320
also do is push the tissue to recall memories that belong to different species. So here is

51:08.320 --> 51:14.640
one planarian species that has a triangular head. You chop off the head. You perturb the electrical

51:14.640 --> 51:18.400
network in a particular way where you basically prevent the cells from communicating with each

51:18.400 --> 51:24.480
other very well for 48 hours. During that time, everything gets kind of confused. You withdraw

51:24.480 --> 51:29.360
the drug, the network settles back down to a stable attractor. When it does, that attractor

51:29.360 --> 51:34.080
sometimes is the correct one. So sometimes you get a nice triangular head. Other times it lands

51:34.080 --> 51:40.080
in the wrong attractor that actually belongs to other species of worms. So you can get round heads

51:40.080 --> 51:47.920
like this S-Mediterrania. You can get flat heads like this Pifelina. And it's not just the shape

51:47.920 --> 51:53.840
of the head, but actually the shape of the brain is changed to be just like these other species.

51:53.840 --> 51:59.040
And the distribution of the stem cells is changed. And again, no genetic change here. We didn't do

51:59.040 --> 52:05.680
anything to alter the hardware. We altered the ability of this electrical network to remember

52:05.680 --> 52:15.200
what the correct pattern is during regeneration. And the idea here is not just to make weird-looking

52:15.200 --> 52:20.800
worms and frogs. There's a lot of biomedical implications to all of this, where we're looking

52:20.800 --> 52:28.000
for optimal control of these kinds of outcomes in a way that doesn't require us to try to micromanage

52:28.080 --> 52:31.920
gene expression and so on, which I don't think will be doable in our lifetime. So

52:33.440 --> 52:37.920
there's applications here for cancer, obviously, both diagnostics and for normalization strategy,

52:37.920 --> 52:43.200
so not chemotherapy, but normalization. And of course, for regeneration, using triggers to

52:44.240 --> 52:48.720
regenerate complex organs such as limbs. And so in the last few minutes, I just want to show you

52:49.680 --> 52:59.600
a step away from natural bodies to show you the real plasticity of cells and how remarkable this is.

53:00.720 --> 53:07.600
So evolution provides standard animals with a set of instincts that operate in anatomical

53:07.600 --> 53:12.640
morpho space. These are default outcomes. This is why acorns make oak trees and zebrafish

53:12.640 --> 53:17.440
eggs make zebrafish, right? There's a default outcome. But much like in the nervous system,

53:17.440 --> 53:24.080
there is a lot of reprogrammability here. And so we wanted to understand how much plasticity there is.

53:24.960 --> 53:30.240
And so we wanted these new pattern memories. We wanted to see if they could form very rapidly,

53:30.240 --> 53:34.880
and we want to understand where they come from. So this is the work of a staff scientist in my

53:34.880 --> 53:40.000
group, Doug Blackiston. We have a collaboration through this new institute with Josh Bongard's lab

53:40.000 --> 53:44.880
at the University of Vermont. And his student, Sam Kriegman, now a postdoc in my group.

53:45.680 --> 53:50.240
And what they were doing is computational analysis of the following situation.

53:50.240 --> 53:55.120
If you take cells and you liberate them from their normal environment, right, from the normal

53:55.120 --> 53:59.200
set of instructive interactions that the other cells are telling them to do,

53:59.200 --> 54:03.520
this larger network that has these bigger goals, would they reboot their multicellularity?

54:03.520 --> 54:08.160
What would they do? Would they cooperate? And if so, what is it that they would build?

54:08.160 --> 54:14.240
So we did this simple experiment. Here's a frog embryo. We take some skin cells off of the top

54:14.240 --> 54:18.640
of this early embryo. So these are these are ectodermal cells. We dissociate them. And then we

54:18.640 --> 54:22.720
put them in a little, in a little depression, you can, you can see that here. So basically,

54:22.720 --> 54:27.040
we just dissociate them, and then we just pipet them down into this little hole. And so over the

54:27.040 --> 54:31.920
next, over the next 24 hours, they will simply compact like this. Okay, you can see them,

54:31.920 --> 54:36.400
they compact together, right? And then here, this is actually the flashing you see is actually

54:36.400 --> 54:40.800
calcium signaling. It's some very interesting signaling dynamics, but they make this, this,

54:40.800 --> 54:44.880
this round sort of thing. Now, they could have made lots of, they could have done lots of

54:44.880 --> 54:47.360
different things. They could have crawled away from each other, they could have died,

54:47.360 --> 54:50.960
they could have formed a monolayer, like you see in cell culture, could have done lots of things.

54:50.960 --> 54:56.080
Instead, what they do is they form something we call a xenobot. Xenobot for Xenopus lavis,

54:56.080 --> 55:00.880
that's the name of the frog, and it's a bio bot platform. So first of all, what you see here

55:00.880 --> 55:04.720
is that they are self motile. So here it is swimming along, they have cilia the way the

55:04.720 --> 55:10.400
reason they move is they have little, little hairs known as known as cilia that that they use to,

55:11.360 --> 55:16.960
to, to, to row against, against the medium. And so, and so they, they, they swim along,

55:16.960 --> 55:22.880
the cilia are normally used on the skin to, to move pathogens and mucus off of the, off of the

55:22.880 --> 55:26.960
surface of the frog. And you can see here that, that they have all kinds of behaviors. This one

55:26.960 --> 55:32.400
goes in the circle, this one sort of patrols back and forth, right? Here is some tracking data on

55:32.400 --> 55:36.640
a group of them. This one's going on kind of a longer journey. This one is going in circles,

55:36.640 --> 55:43.280
these two are interacting with each other. These skin cells normally are restricted to a very

55:43.280 --> 55:48.240
boring two dimensional life sitting on the outside of a tackle by the rest, by the instructive

55:48.800 --> 55:53.280
signals from the rest of the animal. When liberated from this, they, it turns out,

55:53.280 --> 55:58.080
they have a completely different capacity to cooperate and make a new sort of little proto

55:58.080 --> 56:03.840
animal. We didn't add anything, we didn't edit the genome, this is, we didn't induce, we didn't

56:03.840 --> 56:10.400
put any, any trans genes, there are no nanomaterials. All we did was take something away. We took away

56:10.400 --> 56:15.840
the restrictive instructive signals that the rest of the cells impose and we asked these

56:15.840 --> 56:19.760
cells, what do they want to do? So now you're starting to see this, this, this multi-scale,

56:21.200 --> 56:25.600
multi-scale competency architecture where the plasticities that, that I've been showing you

56:25.600 --> 56:29.920
about being able to correct for all sorts of defects and so on is because all of the components

56:30.000 --> 56:34.880
have their own agendas, which can be modified by the larger scale network that they're a part of,

56:34.880 --> 56:40.560
but you can start to see this when, when some of those are lifted. Now here is, here it is in a

56:40.560 --> 56:45.600
maze. This is filled with still water. So there's no water flow, it's completely closed. So you can

56:45.600 --> 56:51.040
see it, it, it takes the corner without bumping into the edge. It then decides to turn around and

56:51.040 --> 56:56.400
come back where it came from. Okay. So some sort of internal dynamic. So here it is, I'm swimming

56:56.400 --> 57:01.120
along. It can, it can take this corner without having to bump into the opposite edge. So it

57:01.120 --> 57:06.320
somehow knows that there's a possibility to take a corner here and then, and then it turns around.

57:06.320 --> 57:10.000
We don't know why it turns around. They have all sorts of spontaneous behaviors, right, in this

57:10.000 --> 57:16.080
system. They have the interesting capacity to regenerate themselves. So if you cut them in

57:16.080 --> 57:20.320
half, this one was basically like pinched in half, you can see here over this 180 degree,

57:20.960 --> 57:26.640
that hinge right there, right over that, that 180 degree, the forces, the forces must be, must be

57:26.640 --> 57:32.160
really strong, but was able to do is able to try and fold itself back up into its new shape, into

57:32.160 --> 57:36.960
its new xenobot shape. And if you actually pay attention to the calcium dynamics, you can see

57:36.960 --> 57:41.120
it's very brain-like. They have, this is, you know, this is basically what, what calcium looks like

57:41.840 --> 57:46.480
in, in, in brains. When you image living, living animals, there are no neurons here. This is just

57:46.480 --> 57:51.760
skin. Everything that you've seen was just skin cells cooperating towards a new kind of morphology,

57:51.760 --> 57:57.120
right? They have another very interesting behavior that we first saw. That's a kind of herding behavior

57:57.120 --> 58:02.800
where they operate in groups like this and they, they, they do these kind of circular, these kind

58:02.800 --> 58:09.040
of circular behaviors to make little piles. And, and why do they make little piles? Well, the most

58:09.040 --> 58:15.920
amazing thing is that these little piles, if these little piles are themselves skin cells,

58:16.000 --> 58:20.320
then what they will do is they will push them together into these little piles. Guess what the

58:20.320 --> 58:25.520
little piles become? The little piles become the next generation of xenobots. So there's,

58:25.520 --> 58:28.000
there's a couple of interesting things going on here. First of all,

58:29.440 --> 58:34.240
this is a kind of replication. It's not a real lineage. They don't have strong heredity yet,

58:34.240 --> 58:41.760
but it's a kind of replication because given components in the environment, they will make copies

58:41.760 --> 58:46.720
of themselves. This is much closer to Von Neumann's idea of reproducing machines than to the way that

58:46.720 --> 58:50.320
any other organism reproduces, right? So they will, they will go around, they will make, you know,

58:50.320 --> 58:54.000
multiple generations of these little balls and the little balls become xenobots and continue the

58:54.000 --> 59:00.160
cycle and keep doing it again and again. One interesting thing is that what's happened here

59:00.160 --> 59:05.600
is that when we made it impossible for these cells to reproduce in their normal fashion,

59:05.600 --> 59:12.560
within 48 hours, they have found a new way to pretty much do the same thing that has never

59:12.560 --> 59:16.960
existed, as to our knowledge, never existed in evolution. No other, no other animal does this.

59:16.960 --> 59:22.320
And so this is an amazing example, I think, an amazing example of problem solving and

59:22.320 --> 59:27.120
plasticity. When you can't do things the original way, you can repurpose your existing hardware

59:27.120 --> 59:33.360
to swim around to, and then to undergo behaviors that will actually do things that you can't do

59:33.360 --> 59:38.800
the normal way. That's the first thing. The second thing to note here is that when we made these

59:38.800 --> 59:44.400
xenobots, we, it was very much a collaboration between us and the cells themselves. We don't

59:44.400 --> 59:51.680
know how to tell cells to assume a particular shape yet. All we were able to do was to remove some

59:51.680 --> 59:55.600
constraints and put them in the new environment. The cells did all the rest after that, all the

59:55.600 --> 59:59.840
heavy lifting. And we, and this is, this is very important because it's a new kind of

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:05.920
robotics and engineering where your material is not passive. It is not active. It's more than that.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:10.720
It's an agential material, right? The new, I think the future of bioengineering is,

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:16.400
of engineering in general, is working with parts that are themselves some sort of simple,

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:20.320
or maybe not so simple, homeostatic agent. So that what you're doing is you're not engineering

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.320
the way we normally engineer. You micromanage every part. You have to know how to do everything.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:32.320
You are actually signaling to, you know, you're trying to shift the way that your parts are

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.080
going to behave because they have their own behavior. And evolution does exactly that.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:40.400
When these, when these bots make the next generation of bots, this only works because

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.800
the material they are working with, the cells that they are working with is itself an agential

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.400
material and is going to do the same things on its own. That's the only reason this works.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.120
And that's, and the same is true of evolution. When you, when you try to change an organism,

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:59.120
you have to motivate and affect its guided self-assembly, the cells that you're working with.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:03.360
They have their own, they have their own agendas. And so when you see these Xenobots,

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.760
they have a normal frog genome. And these Xenobots don't have a straightforward evolutionary

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:13.040
backstory. If you ask, why do Xenobots have a particular behavior and structure, the answer

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.880
is not because for millions of years they were selected to be good Xenobots. There's never

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:22.000
been any Xenobots. So the cells themselves were part of the evolutionary stream on Earth,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.640
but they were selected for a completely different set of functions. So we really need to understand

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:32.640
how it is that evolution doesn't make, it doesn't find solutions to specific problems. It finds

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.760
machines that solve problems in novel ways. Right. So here's the, here's the unique developmental

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:42.000
sequence of a Xenobot. This is what normal frogs do. They are, they look like this and they look

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.080
like that. Then they run around like this. This is what Xenobots do. They make a, they make a body

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.560
like this. Eventually they will transition in, you know, two months later, they transition into

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.160
something that looks like that. Where does that come from? That's never existed before

01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:01.440
during evolution. So just to close up, here's, here's the, the, the summary of what I tried to

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:08.160
say is that there is a framework which is really focused on a continuum of agency, not binary

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:15.440
categories. It's very engineering focused in terms of finding the best most appropriate models

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:22.160
for, to explain the scaling of, of cognition. The materials don't matter. There is no privileged

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:28.160
substrate. One useful way to think about systems is as the scale of goals that they are capable of,

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:33.680
of, of pursuing, we can think of intelligence as problem solving and abstract spaces.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:39.200
And developmental bio electricity is a great way to start to look at how competent individuals

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:43.520
can scale their goals. And I think that's exactly what, what evolution did. And we can certainly

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:49.360
do that. Evolution is hugely potentiated, sped up by this kind of multi-scale competency

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.840
architecture. And the biggest, to me, one of the biggest questions going forward is,

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.480
where do these goals come from? It's not going to be selection. Where else can they come from?

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:04.640
And I just want to remind people that now with the new technologies, everything that every, every

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:08.640
organism you've ever heard of, right? Everything that Darwin meant when he said, endless forms,

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:14.720
most beautiful, all of that is a tiny little corner of this incredibly large state space of,

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:21.440
of cyborgs and hybrids and, and chimeras and all, all possible combinations of evolved material,

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:28.000
engineered material and artificial intelligence. And we're going to have to be able to relate in

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.800
some way to these things when we're not able to say what it is and what it's capable of based

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:37.440
on what it looks like and where it came from. So lots of, lots of papers on all these things.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:44.080
I'm happy to send, send things out. These are the, the people that did all of the, the hard work

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.800
of the things that I showed you today. So I thank them. I thank our collaborators, our funders,

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:54.240
of course, and the model systems, which, which always do the heavy lifting. And I will stop here

01:03:54.320 --> 01:04:04.080
and thank you. Okay.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:21.120
Can you hear us, Michael? Yeah, yeah, okay. Well, amazing talk. What can I say? I'm, I'm really,

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.960
really impressed. I knew some of your research personally, but now that I see more, I want to

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:35.120
know more. Very, very nice attractor of topics. What we start with the question round. Anybody

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:46.480
has questions, comments? Yeah, Francis. Well, I think what this illustrates is that agency

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:53.920
is something very primitive in life. And agency is not just adaptation, as you say, to very specific

01:04:53.920 --> 01:05:01.760
selective pressures, but it's adaptation to a wide range of things. So it's the plasticity,

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:08.000
it's the flexibility, it's the adaptivity that has been selected. So I assume that these cells

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.200
have some general agential behaviors, which adapt to the circumstances and when the circumstances

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:19.680
are very different, like in the case of these Xenobots, I assume there is still enough agency

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:25.520
left that they can do things that look kind of intelligent, even though they are completely

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:33.120
different from what they normally do. So it reinforces a little bit my proposal in my talk

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:38.400
that I said that the first step is of the salt maintenance. It's a zillions where zillions means

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:44.320
expanding your basin of attraction, it means expanding the space in which you can solve problems.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:49.600
So what these things probably have learned a valuable time ago before they were folks,

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:55.360
is to expand this space for problems they could solve so that now if you take them out of their

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:59.920
normal space where they are in the folks body, they can still do things in this completely

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:05.200
different space because they have most this kind of generic agency you might want.

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:13.200
Yeah, I think that's absolutely correct. Of course, one of the big mysteries that we

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:19.920
now have to address, and we're doing this in computational models and at the bench,

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:27.840
is to really understand how evolution is able to produce this because the standard story is

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:35.120
that evolution is supposed to always pick the immediate short-term benefit and how it is that

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:42.240
it maximizes this incredible ability to problem solve instead of a very hard wire, and certainly

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.920
there are animals that act hardwired in various ways, you know, C. elegans and things like that,

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:52.640
but the majority are exactly as you just said, and so how that arises from evolutionary dynamics

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:59.040
that we're always told are very kind of short-sighted and always taking the immediate benefit,

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:03.120
it's not clear and that represents a huge area for research.

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:08.880
Well, my hypothesis is that when we think about evolution, we're thinking about

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:13.920
organisms that are already very highly specialized and then they are already so well

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:18.720
optimized for certain things that they can't afford to take risks to make too many changes,

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:22.720
but if you think about the origin of life and you think about all the catalytic systems

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:29.120
where there are all kinds of molecules coming and going and temperatures changing and water

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:36.000
entering and drying out, these very first thoughts, they had to be extremely non-specialized,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:42.960
they had to be extremely resilient, they had to be extremely adaptive and probably these properties

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:48.800
are just properties that define life to have to get to the first living cells, you had to have this

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:55.600
extreme adaptivity and then once you had this more specialized organism, you didn't need

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:59.920
all these functions anymore, but they are still there because they can be the essence of life.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:17.520
More comments, questions? No? Well, I have a little question here, this hand has a little question.

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:21.280
Oh, it's frozen even better.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:36.000
So, as I understand, you are using the electrical field on the cell,

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:43.280
or what electrical what is the voltage, you measure the voltages, but what would be like the

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:53.120
real object that is being measured there? Yeah, what we're measuring is the voltage difference

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:57.680
between the inside and the outside of the cell, so every cell has a membrane and there's an

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:02.960
electrical potential between zero and let's say 80 millivolts, that's between the inside and the

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:09.520
outside, so what we're looking at is if you think about a neural network or an artificial neural

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:16.720
network where every node has an activation level, and so what we're looking at is the electrical

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:23.840
state of every individual cell, but that's not actually where the information is, the information

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:31.120
is in the flow of electrical computations through the whole network, so what we're measuring is the

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:37.920
spatial pattern and then over time we would take videos of each individual activation weight, it's

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:46.080
exactly like neuroscience except that the time is greatly slowed down, so you can take almost

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.960
any neuroscience paper and just do a fine to replace and Microsoft Word replace the words

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:56.080
neuron with the word cell, replace millisecond with hour and everything else basically works,

01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:03.280
it's the same kind of thing. Yeah, so these patterns that are across multiple cells then

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:08.720
it's not the, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no that's critical, that's critical, it's not individual cells, yeah.

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:16.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so okay, so yeah, yeah, okay, and I have, sorry, sorry, did it,

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:22.960
when, yeah, yeah, but continue first. It's the, it's the, it's where I'm getting to the question, so,

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:32.080
so you are using now, there is this genetic information that is kind of like the hardware

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:37.920
you were mentioning, then you have the electrical field which is the electrical component which

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:44.880
encodes an extra mechanism which has been kind of like overlooked by evolutionary morphogenesis or

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:53.280
like by the fields you were mentioning and then I wonder, like this is, my wonder is like

01:10:53.680 --> 01:11:01.440
might there be other forces at play? Have you have, have you studied or measured or why would

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:08.560
have to be only electrical? So, so that's the, since there are many other physical quantities

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:15.120
that might have similar dynamics and play a role in transmission and so on. Sure, sure, sure,

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:19.760
there, there are many others and many people study them, there's biomechanical forces,

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:24.480
there is ultra-weak photon emission, there are of course chemical gradients that everybody

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.840
studies, all of these exist. My claim is not that they're not important or that bioelectricity

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.600
does everything, no, but, but bioelectricity is where the only data that I know of has been

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:41.840
obtained where those bioelectrical dynamics are actually the memory medium of this collective

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.840
intelligence. It's possible that, you know, 10 years from now somebody will find out that the

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:50.240
biomechanical stress patterns are also storing the same thing, entirely possible, but it hasn't

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:54.560
been done. The only, you know, these other, these other forces have been treated as,

01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:01.120
as pieces of physics at the lowest level that need to be tracked to, to understand the system

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.520
and their bioelectricity is exactly like all these others, but what we have shown, I think,

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:12.640
is that bioelectricity has a really important role as the, as the, as the actual medium of the

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:17.200
computation. So it's like, you know, you can look at a computer and okay, yep, there are stress

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:23.200
forces, there are vibrations, there are, you know, heat gradients, all kinds of things going on, but

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:28.880
if you want to really understand what computations they're doing, the bioelectric, the, you know,

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:35.520
the electric patterns through the circuits have a privileged status and maybe these other modalities

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:40.160
will have the same thing. It's entirely possible, maybe evolution uses them all, but it's, but it's

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:45.280
not known. It's only known at this point for the bioelectrics. Yeah, yeah, that was my, my question.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:53.680
Please do it. Yeah, very amazing talk, first of all, and I knew your work already, so, but okay,

01:12:53.680 --> 01:13:01.600
it was nice to see all these little details explained carefully. No, I, I, I'm a counter

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:09.920
physicist. So electricity is, is thought over. So in a certain way, I wonder actually,

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:17.200
certainly because you have this memory effect. So there is something new being revealed here,

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:25.280
I think, that has not been really identified. And that is difficult to, to explain out of Darwinian

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:31.360
evolution, even in, in, in an easy way at least in a straightforward way. Well, that's also the

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:40.960
message which was a little bit in your talk, I think. So I wonder whether, because it would be too

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:46.560
long to, to, to tell you the details now, but I could send you some, some, some material there. But

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:51.760
let's say we are working on, on an integration of quantum physics where this would fit in in some

01:13:51.760 --> 01:14:00.160
way, you see, that would be things happening on the quantum level in, in, in, in, in photon clouds,

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:10.480
which, which, which were not, which not have been revealed yet, yet clearly that have to do with,

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:19.520
with meaning, meaning that would be stored in, in, in light in some way. And so, so it's amazing,

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:24.320
it's amazing, these experiments. Thank you. I knew them already. So it was not the first time that

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:30.880
I saw them. But let's say that. Yeah. Yeah, I'd be very happy to, yeah, please send me, yeah, send

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:36.160
me, send me what you have. I will send you an email because this would take too long to make

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:42.880
my own explanation. Exactly the kind of things that we want to, want to happen, that we connect

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:49.440
with each other and also the online audience can also bring, bring connections. And why not keep,

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:54.800
keep discussing. I'm totally interested in this. And I know some people who will be interested too.

01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:01.040
So I'm kind of new to the topic, but it's extremely, extremely interesting as for me as well. Please,

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:07.040
Francis. Another thing that I find very interesting in your work I had heard about it is before this

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:12.880
idea of the cognitive boundary, where you use the metaphor of the light cone, but I'm not sure

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:19.280
that's a very good metaphor because the light kind of extends in this way while yours comes together

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:25.760
so maybe more something like a cognitive horizon, I would say the horizon is as far as you can see.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:31.120
And I personally have been using the concept already for years of prospect, the prospect is

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:37.200
what you can see ahead of you and what you can imagine to be good or bad. So prospect is both

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:44.640
an anticipation and a notion of good or bad or value. The prospect is the things you see

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:50.320
potentially that you may go to or that you may want to avoid. And I think your notion of cognitive

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:55.760
bond is very similar to my notion of prospect. And indeed, the term in evolution, you might say,

01:15:55.760 --> 01:16:02.400
is to extant the prospect because the larger the prospect, the easier it becomes to find something

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:08.480
valuable to go towards a goal that is worthwhile and the easier it also becomes to see the potential

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:17.360
dangers and to avoid them. So I just heard a commentary about Théâtre de Chardin, who had

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:23.040
a kind of a mystical philosophy, but he had very good intuitions. He had this law of complexity

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:28.240
consciousness where he says during evolution, complexity and consciousness increase at the

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:32.640
same time. And this notion of consciousness was a little bit like this notion of the cognitive

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:39.520
boundary. As evolution progresses, the systems can see farther and can see wider around them.

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:45.680
And that comes with the idea of the north here, by the internet. Now we can all in a sense see

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:51.200
what's happening all around the world. So it's this extension of the cognitive boundary. I think

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.880
all what I call prospect, I think that's a very important idea.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:03.600
Yeah, I agree. Can I say something? Can you hear me? I can hear you. Yeah. Yeah. Great.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:12.160
Thank you very much. Yes, for this amazing talk. I just want to make a make a make a notion in

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:19.920
terms of interdisciplinarity. Because what you said, I find super interesting and super

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:26.640
amazing where where is the shape defined or located in the first place? This is the one

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:34.560
question you put in the the other one was how does it the system knows when it is right,

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:39.920
the the the forming of the shape and these two questions are exactly the crucial crucial

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:45.680
questions in in design in the in the artistic process. So this did really strike me when you

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.880
were saying this. So where are these and is it possible to find these set points?

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:57.680
And so I think this this this this happens on on on on many different levels. These I think these

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:05.360
are two very, very deep and important questions. This is just what I want to to to say. Yeah.

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:10.880
Really, thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah, I took a bunch of notes during your talk. So I will

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:15.760
be I will be emailing you afterwards. I completely agree. There are some nice nice similarities

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:25.840
here. Yeah, great. Thank you. Okay, amazing. Then we will take a little break and have some coffee

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:32.240
on this side of the of the universe. And then we'll see you back for our last talk, where

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:39.920
Maximiliano Sanin will tell us about transport networks and why they modeling is the wrong way.

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:46.320
So I will stop the recording now and then stop the call so the videos can be

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:53.600
generated. So see you in nearly 15 minutes. Okay, thank you guys. Until soon. Thanks, Michael.
