0	16800	Yeah, I hear some echoes of people could. Yeah, I think we have to mute. It's us probably.
16800	23280	So I will mute myself before once you start. So, okay, we were having now like Michael
23600	32000	talk. And I think, where is your screen share? Are you sharing a screen?
33200	35040	Correct. I'm already sharing the screen. Yeah.
36400	41600	Can people not see my screen? We don't we don't see your screen, but it might be.
41600	54240	You don't see this? Are people not seeing the slides? It's us. It's us that we are not
55280	62640	swap video. There you go. Okay. So now we have you. And let's confirm with the other. Yeah,
62640	67760	the audience can see it. So we are fine. Okay. Welcome, Michael. Thank you for participating
67760	74960	in our conference and workshop and the stage is yours. Very good. Thank you so much for inviting
74960	80800	me. This has been an extremely interesting workshop. Lots of new ideas. And I look forward to sharing
80800	86960	some more information with you and some thoughts. All of the primary papers and if you need to get
86960	91040	in touch with me, these two websites, you can reach me all the papers, the data, the software,
91040	96960	everything is there. What I'm going to tell you about today is a framework that I've been developing
96960	104480	based on our empirical data. So probably about 15 years of work at the intersection of developmental
104480	112480	biology and computer science that has driven my attempt to pull together some deep ideas
112480	118400	for how to understand this and how to move it forward. And I call this TAME, T-A-M-E, that
118400	123040	stands for technological approach to mind everywhere. And basically it's a framework for
123040	129200	understanding truly diverse intelligences. You'll see what I mean by that based on fundamentals
129200	134480	of a kind of goal directed behavior in unconventional agents. So the main points
134480	140880	that I would like to transmit today are these. First, that the question of how much agency
140880	146720	or cognition is to be attributed to a particular system has to be treated as an engineering
146720	151440	problem, not philosophical pronouncements of what various systems can and can't have,
151440	160080	but actually an empirical approach to find the optimum level of description to enable control
160080	167040	and prediction of that system. And I'm going to talk about the fact that very diverse intelligences
167040	172160	can actually be directly compared with each other and placed in a sort of the same space.
172160	177760	If we think about the spatiotemporal scale of the goals that these systems are capable of working
177760	182480	towards. So this gives rise to a kind of a model of what I call the cognitive light cone
182480	186720	based on the types of goals that these systems are able to represent and pursue.
187360	192000	And I'm going to show you that synthetic bioengineering and some advances in biology
192000	199120	provide an incredibly large option space for new bodies and new minds. These new creatures don't
199120	206000	have standard evolutionary backstories in this. They are a very important set of systems for
206000	211120	impacting our understanding of evolution of what the genome actually does and so on.
211840	217680	And I'm going to show you some very specific examples from developmental biology looking at
218400	223200	morphogenesis as a kind of unconventional collective intelligence, meaning the collective
223200	228240	intelligence of cells, solving problems in morpho space. That will be the example in which I'm
228240	231680	going to illustrate some of these concepts, but I think they're much, much broader than that.
232160	237680	And I'm going to show you some data showing that developmental bioelectricity provides
237680	242400	an interesting window on the scaling of cognition both during development and during evolution.
243040	249760	So I started this framework prompted by a really interesting conference at the
251040	254960	Diverse Intelligence Summer Institute that Templeton Foundation put on
255680	260800	where we were asked to come up with a way to compare truly diverse intelligences. And this
260800	266800	isn't just humans, apes, birds, and maybe octopus, things like that, but it's actually,
266800	272800	it needs to, a good framework is going to enable us to compare and contrast really unusual creatures,
272800	279440	colonial organisms, swarms like ants and bees and so on, but also synthetic biology, so engineered
279440	284320	novel life forms that never existed before, both unicellular and multicellular. We should be able
284320	291040	to use the same framework with AI, so artificial intelligences, whether embodied or purely software
291040	298640	or whatever. And of course, exobiological agents that we may find during exploration of off the
298640	303680	planet if that ever happens. And the key to this framework is that it has to move experiments
303680	308960	forward. It cannot be pure philosophy, it has to actually suggest, make predictions and suggest
308960	314160	novel capabilities. So the outline for today's talk, I'm going to, isn't basically in three parts.
314160	321520	First, I'm just going to talk about some examples and some, some, some, some ways in which we should
321520	327440	broaden typical cognitive science approaches. Then I will talk about this, this framework,
327440	332640	the philosophical principles, and then some very specific hypotheses for how we can define
332640	337600	selves and how cognition can scale. And then I'm going to show you the vast majority of the talk
337600	343120	is data. So I'm going to show you how we've been using these ideas to understand and control
343120	347920	morphogenesis as a collective intelligence. And then I'm going to show you some novel synthetic
347920	353280	organisms that, that have never existed before. And these are called xenobots. So the first thing
353280	359040	I want to think about is the fact that when we usually think about intelligence and, and, and
359040	364640	cognition and agency, we think about the subject of all of those things, the self. So the self is
364640	371040	this construct that is the owner of complex memories of credit assignment among the individual parts
371040	377200	that function together to, to provide positive and negative outcomes. It's the, it's the owner
377200	382160	of goals and, and preferences and things like that. And the interesting thing about this is that
382160	387920	biology shows us that these, these selves are extremely malleable. They change over time,
387920	392720	not just evolutionary time, but actually during the time of the, the time of the organism.
392720	397600	So for example, here's, here's one example. So this is a caterpillar. And it's a creature,
397600	403520	it's a soft bodied kind of creature that crawls and chews plants. And it needs to turn into this
403520	408240	very different type of creature that flies and drinks nectar. And because of that, the brain
408240	412400	is completely different. So the caterpillar brain is quite different from the, from the,
412400	418640	of butterfly or moth brain. And during this process of metamorphosis, that brain is largely
418720	423280	liquefied, the cells, many of the cells die, most of the synaptic connections are broken.
424000	429440	And a completely new brain is rearranged. This is all during the lifetime of the agent. So if,
429440	433120	you know, if you're philosophically minded, you can ask yourself what it's like to be an agent
433840	438640	during, during the time that your brain is completely reorganized. One of the most amazing
438640	443600	things about this is that the memories, which caterpillars have, in fact, persist through
443600	449360	this process. So the butterfly remembers training that the caterpillars underwent and there's,
449360	455600	there's some nice data on this, you can see reviews of that here. But this is, this is in
455600	460560	fact, not just for, for unusual metamorphosing creatures, all of us made the journey of the
460560	465920	Cartesian cut from a single cell. So we all started life as a single fertilized egg. This is
465920	470400	something that molecular biologists would look and say, this is a machine, this is, you know,
470400	474720	it's a molecular machine. It has lots of biochemical components functioning according to
474720	481120	rules. It's a very nice, you know, it's a very nice piece of physics. And then at some point,
481120	487040	this, this self assembled into one of many creatures in some of which, at least or
487040	492000	possibly all of them have what we consider to be cognition, let's say human in the case of a human
492000	497920	embryo. So all of us went from undertook this journey. And so, so one thing that is clear in
497920	504160	biology is that there is no sharp line that is supportable, where you can say this was just
504160	508240	physics and then something happened and now you have a cognitive being. So, so we have to understand
508240	515680	how, how cognition scales gradually across these kind of scales and it modifies gradually, both
515680	522240	during evolutionary time scales and the animals own development. So this is another way in which
522240	527200	ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny because we all take this, take this journey. So in fact,
528080	533280	we like to think of ourselves as integrated beings, true intelligences, and then maybe
533840	538400	ants and bees have some sort of collective intelligence. But actually, we are all collective
538400	544400	intelligences. We are all made of parts. We are, in particular, we have collections of neurons
544400	550160	and various other cells. And so when you look through, through life forms, you see that they
550160	556560	are made of nested subunits, not only structurally, we all know that we are made of organs made of
556640	562480	tissues, which are made of cells and so on, not just structurally, but actually functionally and
563200	569280	cognitively because there's this evolution uses this multi scale competency architecture,
569280	574960	where every layer solves problems. So from the swarm to the individual animal to the organs to the
575600	582320	cells in the subcellular components, all of these systems solve various kinds of problems in
582320	588880	diverse spaces. Now, what evolution does is reuse some of the same problem solving tricks
588880	595440	in different spaces. Now, we are all very familiar with understanding intelligence when we see it as
596240	600560	operating in three dimensional space, behavioral space. So we see these birds, they know how to
600560	604560	pick up cigarette butts and receive a reward. And we say, okay, that's pretty intelligent,
604560	611120	the bird has learned something. All of our sense organs point outwards. And so we are very familiar
611120	616320	and many animals are very good at detecting agency in the outside world. But if we had
616320	623280	sense organs pointing inwards, let's say a kind of biofeedback where at every step of your life
623280	628960	from childhood, you knew exactly what your liver or your pancreas was doing with respect to what are
628960	634720	the physiological states, what are the actions that it takes, we would then have no problem
634720	639520	recognizing some of their behavior as intelligence. And what I mean by intelligence is simply problem
639520	646320	solving and to move to better regions of some state space. And these spaces might be the space of
646320	650160	all gene expression, of course, these are all very high dimensional spaces, I sort of collapse
650160	655440	everything into two spaces here. But the space of all possible gene expression, morpheus space,
655440	661600	which we'll spend the most of the talk about, which is the space of possible configurations
661600	667280	of the body. So anatomy, anatomical space, and physiological space. There are many examples,
667440	670960	your organs and your cells are solving problems in these spaces all the time.
671600	676800	And we should be humble about the fact that when we look at a system and try to understand
676800	683440	how much and what kind of intelligence it has, we are ourselves taking an IQ test because recognizing
683440	689520	goal directed problem solving behavior in a system requires us to be smart enough to notice it,
689520	693920	to notice the appropriate space, and to understand what is the system doing. And many times when we
693920	698880	don't see that, we need to ask ourselves if we're in fact missing something important.
699680	705040	So one of the things we can say about intelligence in all these spaces is basically that a kind of
705040	710960	a generic statement is basically that it's proportional to the ability to stay out of
710960	718080	local minima, to have a kind of a wider view of what actions you should take. So that, for example,
718080	722960	you know, this from here to here is the most direct path where this dog can get to where it
722960	727520	wants to go. But actually, if it was willing to have some patience and walk away from it for a while,
727520	733200	it could then do much better. And so there's this sort of local energy barrier that the more
733200	737920	intelligent you are, the more you're able to overcome these kinds of things. And one of the
737920	744640	things that we now are able to do with chimeric and bioengineering technologies is take this
744640	752160	multi-scale biological system and replace any, at any level, replace components of this with
752160	757680	new components that might be engineered, and they might be other cells or molecules of other
757680	764480	creatures. And so we can build these composite beings that are not standard issue evolved creatures.
764480	772880	So we can replace any level of organization, we can replace with components that are somewhere
772960	777920	on this scale somewhere between evolved and designed. So maybe they're natural, maybe they're
777920	782720	modified, maybe they're completely engineered, and they will have some degree of intelligence,
782720	787760	maybe they're just pure mechanism in the sense of the very passive mechanisms, or maybe they will
787760	794000	be quite intelligent problem solving components. And already we start to see this, right? So you
794000	800800	have humans with various appliances, so basically early stage cyborgs, we have bioengineered animals,
800800	806080	we have synthetic machines like hybrids, which are brains driving robotic bodies and so on.
806800	813440	And so you can see this at every portion, we can start to replace these components, right,
813440	819200	whether with DNA or with tissues and so on. And all of these are going to be somewhere
819200	824720	on this hierarchy. See, what's important about this is once we start changing all of these things,
824720	829600	we can no longer use the familiar touchstones of phylogeny. We can't say, well, this kind of looks
829600	836000	like a fish, so therefore I expect fish level sophistication of cognition, because all of these
836000	842240	synthetic and we'll come back to this, these synthetic creations are not going to have
843040	848560	origins or components that make it very easy to say what's going on. So we need a kind of
848560	854880	cybernetic understanding of cognition that isn't based on what you're made of or how you got here,
854880	859840	but it's actually based on much deeper principles of what your cognition is like.
860400	868400	And so that is the beginning of how we started thinking about this approach. And
869680	873680	let's talk a little bit about some of the theory now and then we'll get to the data.
873680	878880	So the foundations, and I only say this because I like to make this explicit, you're going to see
878880	884080	all of this in the next sections, but I'd like to make the philosophical
884560	889680	underpinnings of all this completely explicit, so we all know what's going on. Nothing is hidden here.
889680	895360	The first thing is that I think we need to take evolution and developmental biology very seriously,
895360	901920	and that means doing away with binary categories. When we talk, is it really cognitive? Is it just
901920	908240	physics or does it have real memories? There are no sharp categories here. Everything is very
908240	914960	gradual and we'll talk about that. The point here is that we're not trying to anthropomorphize
914960	920880	simple systems. In fact, nowadays, now that we understand evolution and bioengineering,
920880	926080	I'm not sure there's any such thing as anthropomorphizing in the sense that humans have some sort
926080	930880	of magical properties that can be incorrectly attributed to other types of beings. I don't
930880	937280	think that exists. I think as long as you're appropriately scaling your model to whatever
937280	942880	system you're working with and it's giving you empirical advantages, that's how we have to do
942880	949600	this because there's no other way to do it. I'm going to stick very closely to an engineering
949600	956400	approach where I'm not worried about talking about goals in the cybernetic sense. I'm not
956400	963680	talking about trying to avoid attributing too much agency to things because attributing too much
963680	969280	agency is just as bad as not attributing enough to an engineer. These are identical errors.
970560	976000	We'll talk about the fact that agents are a patchwork of multiple unconventional intelligences
976000	979760	at different levels. I don't believe there's any magic in the material. There's nothing really
979760	985040	magic about synapses or protoplasm or anything else. We're going to be material independent
985040	991680	here. I really want to understand biology, which Chris Langton refers to as life as it can be.
992240	995920	Not zoology, not just the types of plants and animals we have here now, but actually
999360	1004560	what's unique and important about all cognitive systems. One of the things that
1006000	1013120	this framework does from an engineering perspective is simply say that there's a
1013120	1021200	continuum, a smooth continuum with some waypoints along this journey, where the way that you
1021920	1028640	understand the cognitive capacity of whatever system you're dealing with is really defined by
1028640	1035040	what is the most efficient, most optimal way to interact with that system, the way to
1035040	1040560	change the way the system functions. If you're dealing with a certain class of hardware systems,
1040560	1045760	like clocks, for example, your only option is modification of the hardware at the lowest level.
1045760	1049600	You're not going to teach it anything. You're not going to convince it of anything. Hardware
1049600	1055280	modification is your only option. Then there's a more interesting class of devices like
1055280	1063280	thermostats, which are a little further along because they have an encoded setpoint. They spend
1063280	1069760	energy to maintain a specific goal state, and you can interact with them in a very interesting way.
1069760	1075440	You can rewrite or alter the goal state, and then the machine will now pursue that goal,
1075440	1079440	let's say a different temperature range, without you having to rewire the hardware. You don't have
1079440	1082800	to change the hardware of the system. In fact, you don't even have to know about the hardware.
1082800	1086560	You don't have to know how it works. As long as you know what the setpoint is,
1086560	1092640	you can recognize where it's encoded and so on. Then there's a whole other class of systems
1093600	1099360	like this, where you actually need to know even less about what's going on because you can train
1099360	1104480	them. Human beings have been training animals for thousands of years without knowing any neuroscience,
1104560	1111280	because they appreciated the important fact that systems like this can be modified based on
1111280	1115600	stimuli, based on rewards and punishments, and you can actually rely on the system itself to
1115600	1121840	reconfigure its own internal mechanisms in terms of plasticity and various other things,
1121840	1124640	and you don't need to do that. You don't need to micromanage it. You don't even need to know
1124640	1128640	how it works. You just need to understand how to motivate the system, how to communicate with the
1128640	1133760	system. Then we get to some very advanced creatures here, where you can actually communicate not
1133760	1139360	simply with rewards and punishments but actually with cogent reasons for doing things. This is a
1139360	1144720	very engineering approach because the idea is not to have philosophical feelings about whether
1144720	1149520	thermostats do or do not have real desires. The point is actually for any given system,
1149520	1157680	well in any given let's say novel biological or novel engineered system, the task is very simple.
1157680	1162720	Which kind of model gives you the best prediction of control? Using these kind of models on these
1162720	1170400	systems will give you nothing of use, but actually using these kind of models on sophisticated systems
1170400	1174320	actually leaves a lot on the table as far as capabilities, and this is one of the limitations
1174320	1181200	of modern molecular medicine, is that the assumption is that everything is a piece of passive
1181200	1185360	hardware like this and must be dealt with at the hardware level. Genomic editing,
1187120	1191600	rewiring, pathways, protein engineering, everything is focused on the hardware. We've
1191600	1196480	actually done a lot of work showing that some of these other approaches are much more powerful
1196480	1201520	in medical kinds of circumstances where you're trying to get the system to do something complex.
1205840	1212240	One way to think about how all of these different very diverse types of systems can be related to
1212240	1217520	each other is simply to try to map, and again I've collapsed space into one dimension. This is
1217520	1224160	almost like an Minkowski kind of diagram where we can plot on a diagram of space and time what is
1224160	1230320	the scale of the goals that a given system is able to pursue. Now remember this is not a diagram of
1230320	1236160	how far a system can sense or how far away it can act, but actually the size of the goals that a
1236160	1240640	system is able to pursue. So if you're a bacterium or something or a tick or something like that,
1240640	1245840	you are only interested in very local concentrations of certain compounds. You may have a little bit
1245840	1249360	of memory going backwards, you may have a little predictive capacity going forwards,
1249360	1256240	but everything you're doing is in a very small radius of goal-directed activity. You're only
1256240	1261440	interested in very local things, and in fact you're not capable of caring about things that are very
1261440	1266800	far away. So it forms a kind of cognitive light cone of the things that your cognitive system is
1266800	1272400	capable of doing, and so we can think about other animals that may have some pretty good memory going
1272400	1278560	backwards, a little bit of predictive capacity going forwards, but still unable to really care
1278560	1282560	about things that are going to happen two months from now in the next town. It's just impossible
1282560	1286960	for some of these, but if you're a human, for example, you might have an enormous light cone.
1286960	1292240	In fact, uniquely among animals, you might care about things that will for sure take longer than
1292240	1298080	your lifespan. Some of your goals are actually not achievable because your lifespan is not as
1298080	1303760	big as your goal space, and then we can imagine all sorts of other shapes for possible alien or
1303760	1308880	synthetic kinds of creatures, and of course, all of this is nested. So we are a patchwork of
1309520	1314880	modules within modules, each of which is capable, whether in physiological space or anatomical space
1314880	1320480	or behavioral space, contain various sizes of goals, very large, very small, and so on.
1320480	1326960	Now, what's really interesting is that the scale of these cells can change quite rapidly.
1326960	1332000	So here, this is one cell. This is a lacrimaria. There's no brain. There's no nervous system.
1332000	1338160	This is one cell that is handling all of its anatomical, physiological, behavioral, metabolic
1338160	1344720	needs at the level of a single cell. Now, these cells, you know, relatives of these single cells
1344720	1350960	can collaborate together to work on very large things. Here, you see a multicellular body.
1350960	1356000	This is a salamander. If you amputate the limb, the cells immediately begin to grow. They will
1356000	1361120	continue to grow and shape a new limb until it's complete, and then they stop. So we'll talk in
1361120	1366880	a minute about what this is. This is an anatomical homeostasis where the setpoint is very large. All
1366880	1373840	of these cells are solving a problem in anatomical space. They start out in a region of anatomical
1373840	1377200	space that's not good. They want to get to the much better region. That is their goal,
1377200	1382400	and they know how to, the collective is able to get there. So that's the scaling of goals that
1382480	1386880	occurs during evolution, but there's actually a reduction that takes place, and we call that cancer.
1386880	1392800	So what happens is when individual cells, and this is a human glioblastoma, when individual cells
1392800	1396880	become disconnected, functionally disconnected, I'll show you how this works, functionally
1396880	1402720	disconnected from these large-scale goals, they revert back to an ancient unicellular amoeba-like
1402720	1408000	lifestyle where their only goals are to reproduce and to optimize certain metabolic functions,
1408000	1413200	which means migrate wherever life is good. So the boundary between self and world,
1413760	1418080	in this case, these cells basically treat the rest of the body as just an external environment.
1418080	1423840	They're not more selfish than any other biological construct. They're equally selfish,
1423840	1428480	just that the self is not very small. So that boundary between self and world can grow and
1428480	1434320	shrink. And so the way you can schematize it is simply this, that you have individual cells,
1434320	1439360	and this takes place at many layers. I'm just going to introduce this with this example of cells.
1439360	1449440	So individual cells have some degree of being able to compute and remember and make predictions about
1449440	1455760	states of their local environment. But when they join into networks, these, and in particular,
1455760	1460480	I'm going to talk about electrical networks, these networks are actually have a lot, have higher IQ.
1460480	1466720	They're not only measuring information from wider spatial areas, meaning they're
1466720	1471840	integrating lots of signal spatially, but they actually have higher computational capacity,
1471840	1478080	and they're able to have larger scale goals. And so this is what we see. You can sort of
1478080	1485840	track the width and space and time of what these cells are concerned with. And here's a very important
1486800	1496160	component of this, which is stress, this idea that what stresses different kind of agents
1496160	1502400	is basically a delta between your goal states and the state you're in now. Stress is what drives you
1502400	1506880	to make changes, whether it be through gene expression or physiology or behavior, to get
1506880	1511600	closer to your goals. So stress is a kind of metric. But what's very interesting about stress
1512320	1518000	isn't just that delta, stress is the ability to export that delta to your neighbors.
1518000	1524800	So the idea is that all of these cells are able to measure states much larger than what
1524800	1532080	individual cells can care about, and thus reduce the delta for much more complex states.
1532080	1537520	So one can say that if you tell me what you're stressed about, I can make a pretty good guess
1537520	1543040	about your cognitive sophistication. So if the most complicated thing that could possibly stress
1543040	1548000	you is local glucose level, then you're probably something like a bacterium. If you're stressed
1548000	1555120	about the state of the economy on earth, then you're probably a human level or above. Being able
1555120	1561920	to be stressed by complex large scales of events is a very strong driver of sophistication. And so
1561920	1568640	what you can see, now let's look at some data here. What you can do is you can introduce oncogenes,
1568640	1574000	in particular human oncogenes, into normal cells in this frog embryo. This is a tadpole. So here's
1574000	1579520	the eye, here's the gut, the spinal cord is back here. So we can introduce these oncogenes.
1579520	1584080	And what you can see, the first thing that happens when these oncogenes are active is they
1584080	1589040	cause the cells to detach electrically from their neighbors and to enter an aberrant bioelectrical
1589040	1593600	state. This is a voltage map, and I'll show you in a minute, we use this a lot. We map the electrical
1593600	1600240	state of these cells. And here they are, you can actually catch them converting to this kind of
1600240	1606800	ancient amoeba-like state. And the most important thing is that you can actually suppress this
1606800	1611760	process, despite the fact that the oncogene is there. If you grab control of the bioelectric
1611760	1617280	state of the cell by co-injecting an ion channel, that's going to, even though the oncogene is very
1617280	1623840	strongly expressed, there may be no tumor because you're managing the goals that these cells are
1623840	1628000	going to follow. They are now connected to their neighbors, and they're all working towards making
1628000	1635680	a nice skin muscle and everything else. One of the most important things that evolution discovered
1635680	1643600	to do that is this thing called a gap junction. So gap junction is this, it's a primitive synapse,
1643600	1650320	it's an electrical synapse used throughout the body that enables cells to directly communicate
1650320	1657760	with each other to directly connect their intercellular miliars. And what that means is that
1658640	1663440	traditional signaling like this, you have one cell and it produces some kind of signaling factor,
1663440	1671440	and it diffuses and this cell can feel it. It's very easy for these cells to remain separate
1671440	1675200	and keep their identity because once you receive a signal like this, you know it came from the
1675200	1681600	outside. And so you can ignore it, you can remember it or you can not remember it. This
1681600	1685920	cell has its set of memories and this cell has its set of memories about past events that have
1685920	1690720	happened, and it's very easy for them to be separate. But once cells become coupled by these
1690720	1695760	gap junctions, something very interesting happens, the information that comes across does not have
1695760	1701040	any metadata about the owner. So anything that happens to this cell that triggers some kind of
1701440	1706080	second messenger response that serves as a memory engram of that experience,
1706080	1712000	once that propagates into this cell, this cell now has no way to tell whether that information
1712000	1719440	originated related to this cell or in fact it came from this cell. So all of the experiences
1719440	1725840	and prior history of this cell are now shared by them both. They cannot separate who's who,
1725840	1731760	it's a kind of mind meld, so to speak, because their internal miliures are linked in an important
1731760	1737760	way. And so now a lot of their individuality is really stripped, right? You now get this one
1738400	1744400	system with a larger network, larger IQ, lots of memory of what happened to both cells,
1744400	1749920	but it's no longer possible to keep that very strict separation and this is how goals scale.
1749920	1756800	So what you can do, and we're making some very rigorous models of this, is you can start with
1756800	1761600	very simple homeostatic loops, single cells, all they do, let's say pH, right? All they do is they
1761600	1766240	sort of, they measure the pH, they compare to set point, and then they either load, acid load,
1766240	1770960	or efflux, that's it. And so these very small, very humble goals, once you start connecting
1770960	1776000	these cells by gap junctions, you have a bioelectrical medium, you have this excitable medium
1776000	1781920	that's able to store and process very large states as goals. And this is something that's
1781920	1787120	been worked a lot in Hopfield Networks and other kinds of systems. So we are making those kind
1787120	1793920	of models to understand large scale memories, in particular pattern memories, as a scaling of
1793920	1799360	simple homeostatic units in electrical networks, right? It's a kind of a connectionist approach.
1799360	1803760	So let's look at some real data and let's see what you can do with all this.
1803760	1808560	And so we'll do two things. We'll talk about morphogenesis as a collective intelligence,
1808560	1813680	and then we'll look at this novel proto-organism, okay? And we're going to try to understand
1813680	1818080	how these goal memories are actually stored and processed, so the mechanisms
1818080	1824000	by which collective intelligences of cells store set point information. So the first thing
1824800	1830240	I just want to mention is that there are, there's huge plasticity in living things,
1830240	1836320	which has really important implications for evolution. This is a tadpole that we've made.
1836320	1840080	There are no eyes in the primary where they're supposed to go. So these are nostrils, here's
1840080	1844640	the brain, here's the gut. So what we've done is we suppressed the primary eyes, but we've,
1844640	1848320	we induced an eye on the tail, and we can have a separate discussion about how we do that,
1848320	1854080	we do that through the techniques that I'm talking about today. We induce the eye on the tail,
1854080	1858160	and we have this machine that tests these animals for visual learning and basically trains them for
1858160	1863040	certain behaviors and visual cues. We find out that these animals can see perfectly well.
1864240	1869360	This eye synapses onto the spinal cord, not the brain, and their behavior is quite normal.
1869360	1873760	They can learn, they can see, they have very nice, very nice visual behaviors,
1873760	1886960	and so what this means is that the ability of evolution to explore the various configurations
1887040	1891600	is greatly potentiated by the fact that if things happen, let's say there's a mutation that moves
1891600	1897600	the eye, no problem, your behavioral repertoire doesn't automatically fall apart such that now
1897600	1902480	your fitness is very low. In fact, the animal can, the animal can still function, and then you can
1902480	1910160	explore other consequences of that mutation. So this is really important, and this ability,
1910160	1914640	this plasticity, and this ability to handle novel circumstances, that's the key here,
1914640	1919680	is the novelty. This animal evolved for millions of years to process visual input from the eye
1919680	1926400	fields, but one changed and it can handle this. This is another example of problem solving in
1926400	1931600	physiological space. So here's a flatworm, these are plenarium, I'm going to show you much more
1931600	1937440	of this. These flatworms have this amazing property of regeneration. So if you cut off their heads,
1937440	1942000	for example, they will regrow a new head. In fact, they regrow everything. So what we found is that
1942000	1947920	if you take one of these plenarians and you expose them to barium chloride, so barium is a non-specific
1947920	1953520	potassium channel blocker, it's a really bad problem because now these cells can't pass potassium.
1953520	1959200	So the heads of these plenaria literally explode. Overnight they just go head deep
1959200	1963840	progression, they literally explode. But what's incredible is that over the next couple of weeks,
1963840	1969200	if you leave the animal in the barium, they will regrow brand new heads that are completely normal,
1969200	1974400	that are barium adapted. They have no problem with barium whatsoever. So what we did was we
1974400	1980400	did some transcriptomic analysis to simply ask the question, what new genes are expressed in
1980400	1985120	these animals that are not expressed in these animals? How is it that they're barium adapted?
1985120	1990000	What happened? And it turns out it's actually a very small number of genes that was changed
1990000	1996320	in order to do this. So now think about the critical part here is two things. One is that
1996320	2001040	barium is not anything that plenaria find in nature. So there's never been evolutionary selection
2002320	2006960	to put up with barium. That's a completely novel. And the other thing is that cells in the system
2006960	2012160	don't reproduce quickly the way bacteria do. So you can't use some sort of a selectionist
2012160	2016800	explanation that basically everybody tries random sets of gene expression and whoever survives,
2016800	2020400	repopulates the head. There's no time for that. These cells don't turn over that fast.
2020400	2025120	So it's almost a problem here. Think about this problem. You have tens of thousands of different
2025120	2031040	genes that you can turn on and off. I visualize this as a nuclear reactor control room. Your cells
2031040	2036000	are poisoned. You have this physiological stressor. The cells are poisoned. Everything's melting down.
2036000	2040320	You have to find a very small number of genes that you're going to up and down regulate to solve
2040320	2045440	this problem. You've never seen this problem before. How do you know which genes you're going
2045440	2049920	to turn on and off? And so part of that might be some sort of generalization from other problems
2049920	2054720	you've had that may have been similar. For example, excitotoxicity, epilepsy, things like
2054800	2061040	that may be similar to this, but it requires an incredible amount of problem-solving ability to
2061040	2066880	navigate that transcriptional space, that space of all gene expression, to find exactly what you're
2066880	2074960	looking for. So that's an example in physiology. Now let's look at examples in anatomy. So this
2074960	2082720	here is a cross-section through the kidney tubule of a nut of a salamander. And if you look, the
2082720	2090880	normal tubule has eight to 10 cells or so that work together to build a lumen of a particular
2090880	2096640	size. These tubules have a particular diameter. What you can do is you can make these nuts with
2096640	2101520	progressively larger cells. And you do that by inducing extra copy numbers of their chromosomes.
2102240	2105920	Amazingly, the cells put up with it and they just simply get bigger. The cells get bigger.
2105920	2110800	As the cells get bigger, what you will see, and this isn't our work. This goes back to the 40s,
2110880	2117600	what you will see is that fewer and fewer cells are now working together to make basically the
2117600	2122880	same size lumen. So they're adjusting the number of cells based on this really novel and unexpected
2122880	2129600	outcome of having to build a salamander with much larger bricks. So if we had robotics building
2129600	2133840	something, you could give it a completely different size of brick and it would make adjustments and
2133840	2137680	things would still work. We don't have anything like that. The most amazing part of this is that
2138400	2143440	if you make cells that are truly enormous, what will happen is just one cell will bend
2143440	2149440	around itself and achieve the same outcome. So completely different molecular mechanisms,
2149440	2156400	not cell-to-cell communication, but now cytoskeletal bending that gets you to the same place using a
2156400	2163840	different set of molecular components in service of a large-scale anatomical feature. So this is
2163840	2172080	very much looks like a kind of top-down control where the goal of making a tubule can be implemented
2172080	2177360	with diverse, it's got that degeneracy, it can be implemented with diverse molecular mechanisms
2177360	2185360	and the system executes whatever it needs at the lower levels to maintain the correct region of
2185360	2190080	anatomical space at the higher levels. We don't understand how this works, but it fits nicely
2190160	2195440	William James' definition of intelligence, which is same goal through different means,
2195440	2200640	the ability to reach your goal when things are changing, including in this case, not just changes
2200640	2205840	of external environment, but changes of your own components. Your cells are now way bigger than
2205840	2210320	evolution prepared you for and you can still do what you need to do. Here's another example,
2210320	2216000	this is a frog. Frogs, unlike salamanders, normally do not regenerate their legs and so
2216800	2222880	what we've done is in some of our work that aims towards regenerative medicine, we've figured out
2222880	2226720	how to make them regenerate their legs. When you do that, something very interesting happens. This
2226720	2233040	is an early leg. Here's a toenail, here's some toes. These early legs don't look anything like
2233040	2238480	the way that legs normally develop. Eventually, they get to the same place and they make a very
2238480	2244080	nice frog leg at the end, but the intermediate paths are not like developmental strategies at
2244160	2248720	all. In fact, they look kind of like a plant really. It's just a different way to navigate
2248720	2253440	morpho space to get to the same outcome. What you see here is the biology has this incredible
2253440	2260480	plasticity of behavior, of physiology, and of anatomical construction to get to the same goals
2261440	2266480	via very different paths and as I'm going to show you in a minute, also from diverse starting
2266480	2272160	positions. That plasticity, that intelligence of these systems is really important to understand
2272160	2277680	and as we think about shape, we have a very basic question. Where is anatomy specified in the first
2277680	2284160	place? You start life as a collection of blastomeres, your bunch of cells descended from the egg and
2285280	2290320	this is a cross-section of a human torso. This is amazing. Look at this incredible and variant
2290320	2295680	order. All of the cells, the organs, everything is in the right position, the right orientation,
2296240	2310560	the right location relative to each other. How does it know where these things should actually go?
2310560	2317200	People naturally say the genome, but of course, we know how to read genomes now and what's in
2317200	2322480	the genome is the specification of the micro-level hardware. DNA specifies the proteins. There's
2322480	2327680	nothing in the genome that directly talks about anatomical size, shape, symmetry type. It's all
2327680	2333680	about the micro-level hardware. We need to understand how does this order arise? We need to understand
2333680	2342480	if part of it is missing. How do we repair or edit this? How do we get the cells to rebuild?
2342480	2347440	And then as engineers, we want to go one step further and ask, well, what else could these cells
2347440	2351280	build and how could we convince them to build something completely different than their default
2351280	2356880	outcome? And so I've already shown you this, that these individual cells are very competent
2356880	2363760	on their individual cell scale, but it gets much more interesting in examples like this.
2364480	2368560	This here, what you're seeing here is that this is a normal tappel. So here are the eyes, here's
2368560	2373520	the brain, here's the gut, and these tappels need to become a frog. In order for a tappel to become
2373520	2378400	a frog, they have to rearrange their face. So this means that they have to move their jaws,
2378480	2382720	have to move forward, their eyes have to move inward, everything has to move. And it was thought
2382720	2389280	previously that somehow the genetics basically tells each organ the direction and the amount to
2389280	2394400	move because then you can always go from a standard tappel to a standard frog. So what we did was we
2394400	2399040	made these, we call them Picasso frogs. They are completely mixed up. Everything is in the wrong
2399040	2404560	place. The jaws are off to the side. The eyes are on the back of the head. Everything is moved
2404560	2409200	around. And when you do this, what you find out is that they still make largely quite normal
2409200	2414400	frogs because all of these organs will move around in unnatural paths. In fact, sometimes
2414400	2418960	they go too far and they actually have to have to come back. They will keep moving until a correct
2418960	2424960	frog face is built. So what the system actually does is the genetics doesn't specify the movements.
2424960	2433760	The genetics specifies the seed that constructs a machine that minimizes error. It's able to,
2433760	2438240	from novel starting configurations, it's progressively able to minimize the delta
2438240	2441920	between where we are now and what the correct face is, which obviously raises some important
2441920	2447920	questions. How does it know what the correct frog face looks like? So in my group, what we've been
2447920	2454000	doing is this is kind of the standard model of developmental biology where you have gene
2454560	2459440	regulatory networks that turn each other on and off. Some of these genes make proteins that are
2459440	2463360	sticky or they diffuse or they're doing various things. So then there's this parallel physics
2463360	2469040	that goes on and then there's this process of emergence where if lots of individual pieces
2469040	2474160	do execute these local rules, then eventually something very complex happens like this nice
2474160	2479200	style manner. So this is all true. This is all happens. Of course, there is a feed forward,
2479200	2484960	a emergent component to this, but there's actually also a very important set of feedbacks
2484960	2488880	that occur both at the level of physics and genetics and we're going to talk about the
2488880	2496160	physical one here today that basically executes a loop of anatomical homeostasis
2496160	2501200	when the system is perturbed from its normal target morphology and this might be with injury,
2501200	2509440	with pre-cancerous conversions, with teratogens, mutation, anything that takes the system away
2509440	2516960	from that's correct shape kick starts cascades that will try to get back to the correct location
2517520	2524400	in morpho space. So what we needed to know was can we find the storage mechanism for the set
2524400	2528560	point, right? Every homeostatic process has a set point and so what you want to do is you want to
2528560	2533200	find the storage mechanism of the set point and you want to know how to change it. Can we learn
2533200	2538160	to read and write these set points and this is very important for the kind of biomedical approaches
2538160	2544480	that we're really focused on in my group because making changes here, which is what all of molecular
2544480	2550560	medicine tries to do is to make changes somewhere down here is incredibly difficult as a means of
2550560	2555040	changing what we really care about which is anatomy, which is solving birth defects and
2555040	2560800	traumatic injury and aging and things like this because reversing this to be able to decide what
2560800	2564720	changes do you need to make is incredibly hard. This is an inverse problem that's probably
2564720	2571600	unsolvable to try to in general to try to reverse this highly non-linear highly recursive process
2571600	2576800	to say what do I need to do at the micro level to get me to a desired system level state.
2577520	2581040	So what we would like to do is we'd like to change the set point, leave all of this intact. The cells
2581040	2585520	are very good at implementing different set points. We just like to change the set points. So where is
2585520	2592080	it encoded? So we took our inspiration from the brain. We know how this works in brain brains are
2592080	2598000	an excellent system for maintaining behavioral set points and being intelligent about getting to
2598080	2603360	those set points. So we said, how does this work in the brain? Well, in the brain, you've got some
2603360	2610000	cellular hardware that basically is a set of electrical networks that is the home of the
2610880	2615200	interesting electrical dynamics, which you might call the software because it's able to be changed
2615200	2620160	by experience and so on. And what people in neuroscience are doing is this project called
2620160	2626000	neural decoding. So the commitment is that if you were to read and be able to decode all of the
2626000	2631440	electrical activity in the brain, you could infer the the memories, the preferences, the
2631440	2635360	goal states, you know, that's where it's all encoded. It's all encoded in the electrochemical
2635360	2640160	dynamics of what this hardware is doing. And what the nervous system is using all this for is to
2640160	2644160	coordinate muscles in three dimensional space so that you can move around and do various things.
2644880	2648720	What did evolution, where did this come from? You know, in evolution, this is a brain didn't
2648720	2652800	just appear out of nowhere. These electrical systems are actually ancient, even bacterial
2652800	2657600	biofilms have all of this stuff. So what did this look like before we had brains before we had
2657600	2666000	muscles for large scale behavior? It looked actually surprisingly similar. It we have the
2666000	2671280	exact same scheme. So you have all cells in the body are actually producing these these electrical
2671280	2676880	dynamics through the network. And what you can do and this is a video of a early frog embryo,
2676880	2680400	we're tracking the voltage, this is not a model or a simulation, this is real data,
2680400	2684720	you're looking at all the electrical dynamics, as you might when you look at a brain,
2684720	2689600	that we could try to read and we could test the hypothesis that these electrical dynamics
2689600	2693840	are the medium in which the collective intelligence of these cells is making decisions,
2693840	2697680	who's going to be anterior, posterior, left, right, how many heads do we have and things like
2697680	2702720	that. So it's a very parallel project to what neuroscience is doing, but taken away from sort
2702720	2708880	of generalized away from neurons and asked about all cells. So just again, to nail this down,
2708880	2712880	all cells, this is developmental bio electricity, all cells have ion channels,
2712880	2718000	all cells set electrical resting potentials, they communicate those through gap junctions,
2718000	2723920	which we met a few slides ago, that can communicate them through to their to their neighbors using
2723920	2731840	the exact same mechanisms. And here you can you can read about how we think that that that
2731840	2738400	coordinating problems in morphospace was the basis of intelligence in behavior when evolution
2738400	2744880	pivoted from just coordinating the body shape to actually running around in three dimensional
2744880	2751840	space by using muscles and sense organs and things like that. So let's let's think about
2752480	2758800	how then if I'm making the claim that that these bio electrical patterns are a kind of cognitive
2758800	2763520	proto cognitive medium for making decisions in anatomical space and I'm just going to show you
2763520	2767920	want some examples of that. So here's our planarian, here's the flatworm, here are the eyes, the head,
2767920	2772960	here's the tail. What we can do is we can first ask, let's look at gene expression, which of these
2772960	2776800	cells think they're part of the head? Well, it's this one, these blue cells here, right? So there's
2776800	2780640	anterior gene expression in the head, there's none in the tail, that's very good. So it's supposed
2780640	2786400	to be when you cut off the head and the tail, this middle fragment remembers exactly what goes at
2786400	2792240	each end and pretty soon you have a new planarian, one head, one tail, fine. Now here's another planarian,
2792240	2797760	again, one head, one tail, again, anterior gene expression in the in the head, that's fine.
2797760	2802800	When you cut this guy, you get something amazing, which is a two headed form. Now this is not photoshop,
2802800	2808160	these are these are real animals. Now, why would this animal with normal gene expression and normal
2808160	2813600	anatomy, why would this animal suddenly, by the way, this process is 100% of fidelity, you know,
2813600	2818480	it's habit, it's very hard to make them make a mistake, they always basically do this correctly.
2818480	2824160	Why would they suddenly make a two headed animal? Because in the meantime, what we did was we looked
2824160	2831120	at a bioelectrical circuit that, oops, that we looked at this, this bioelectrical circuit,
2831120	2837520	and we realized that there might be some, there might be a gradient, some electrical communication
2837520	2843760	that allows these cells to remember how many heads they're supposed to have and where the heads go.
2843760	2848560	And so what we did was we learned to, to, to suppress this, and this is not with applied
2848560	2854960	electric fields or magnets or anything like that, this is by using RNA interference and specific
2854960	2862000	drugs to target ion channels, target the native machinery by which these cells produce the voltage
2862000	2870640	gradients. And what we found is that these animals actually make two headed to these,
2870640	2874640	these, what, once, once the electric circuit is perturbed in a very specific way,
2874640	2879040	actually make two headed animals. And one of the most amazing aspects of these,
2879760	2883520	of these two headed animals is that, and I keep calling this a memory, here's why,
2883520	2888560	if you were to recut this animal again, in plain water, no more manipulations of any kind. So
2889600	2894640	you chop off the primary head, you get rid of this ectopic secondary head, if you thought some of
2894640	2899200	these cells were, you know, epigenetically reprogrammed to be ahead, fine, they, we throw them away,
2899200	2903680	all we leave is this nice normal gut fragment. And that was nothing weird about that, about
2903680	2908240	this gut fragment that the genetics are unchanged. And so you might think that it should just
2908240	2913040	regenerate a normal planarian, but that's not what happens. They regenerate these two headed
2913040	2917600	forms. And if you cut those, they still regenerate as two headed forms. And this is basically
2917600	2923040	permanent. And we now know how to change that circuit back with a, with another brief, bi-electrical
2924000	2930000	drug stimulation, change it back to being one headed. So the question of how many heads a
2930000	2936000	planarian has, or is supposed to have, is quite interesting. The default that, that the hardware
2936000	2940720	specified by the genome will make is one, but that's not really where the information is stored.
2940720	2946000	The information is stored, as I'll show you momentarily, in the real time electrical state of a
2946000	2951040	circuit that tells these cells what the target morphology of a correct planarian is. It is the
2951040	2955040	set point. And that set point is not genetic. The genetics here are untouched. We didn't edit
2955040	2962160	the genome or anything like that. We, we changed the encoding of what the correct state is
2963280	2968000	considered by these cells when they are injured. And so this meets all the properties of memory.
2968000	2973680	It's long-term stable. It's rewritable. It has conditional recall, which looks like this. So
2974480	2979360	the reason that, that this guy made a two headed animal is that we looked at the bi-electrical
2979360	2984560	circuit. Here's what a normal one state looks like. The voltage here just tells you one head.
2984560	2988560	And what we did was we altered it. And it's a little messy. The technology is still being worked
2988560	2994880	out. But basically what we did was we induced a different pattern memory in the exact same kind
2994880	3000880	of body. So this says when you are injured, you will build to the target morphology. And this
3000880	3005920	is what the correct planarian target morphology looks like. Make two heads. And that's what it does.
3005920	3012720	So to be super clear, this electrical map is not the memory of this existing animal.
3012720	3018800	This is a memory of this one headed animal. So a one headed body, a normal, a normal body can
3018800	3024000	store at least one of two different representations of what a correct planarian should look like.
3024000	3026480	So this is what I mean when I say the bi-electrical state is the
3027200	3031840	protocognitive medium of this collective intelligence. The cells are literally keeping
3031840	3035600	a representation, a visible, I mean, we can read this now and we can rewrite it,
3035600	3040880	a visible bi-electric representation of what they should do if they get injured. Until they get
3040880	3045120	injured, this pattern is ignored. It's a latent memory. It doesn't do anything. Once it gets injured,
3045120	3049680	then you see what it is because it guides them to make this two headed one. Now,
3050320	3055840	this kind of approach can make ectopic heads of the same species. And that's kind of
3056720	3061040	sufficiently surprising. But we can go further than this. And it turns out that what you can
3061040	3068320	also do is push the tissue to recall memories that belong to different species. So here is
3068320	3074640	one planarian species that has a triangular head. You chop off the head. You perturb the electrical
3074640	3078400	network in a particular way where you basically prevent the cells from communicating with each
3078400	3084480	other very well for 48 hours. During that time, everything gets kind of confused. You withdraw
3084480	3089360	the drug, the network settles back down to a stable attractor. When it does, that attractor
3089360	3094080	sometimes is the correct one. So sometimes you get a nice triangular head. Other times it lands
3094080	3100080	in the wrong attractor that actually belongs to other species of worms. So you can get round heads
3100080	3107920	like this S-Mediterrania. You can get flat heads like this Pifelina. And it's not just the shape
3107920	3113840	of the head, but actually the shape of the brain is changed to be just like these other species.
3113840	3119040	And the distribution of the stem cells is changed. And again, no genetic change here. We didn't do
3119040	3125680	anything to alter the hardware. We altered the ability of this electrical network to remember
3125680	3135200	what the correct pattern is during regeneration. And the idea here is not just to make weird-looking
3135200	3140800	worms and frogs. There's a lot of biomedical implications to all of this, where we're looking
3140800	3148000	for optimal control of these kinds of outcomes in a way that doesn't require us to try to micromanage
3148080	3151920	gene expression and so on, which I don't think will be doable in our lifetime. So
3153440	3157920	there's applications here for cancer, obviously, both diagnostics and for normalization strategy,
3157920	3163200	so not chemotherapy, but normalization. And of course, for regeneration, using triggers to
3164240	3168720	regenerate complex organs such as limbs. And so in the last few minutes, I just want to show you
3169680	3179600	a step away from natural bodies to show you the real plasticity of cells and how remarkable this is.
3180720	3187600	So evolution provides standard animals with a set of instincts that operate in anatomical
3187600	3192640	morpho space. These are default outcomes. This is why acorns make oak trees and zebrafish
3192640	3197440	eggs make zebrafish, right? There's a default outcome. But much like in the nervous system,
3197440	3204080	there is a lot of reprogrammability here. And so we wanted to understand how much plasticity there is.
3204960	3210240	And so we wanted these new pattern memories. We wanted to see if they could form very rapidly,
3210240	3214880	and we want to understand where they come from. So this is the work of a staff scientist in my
3214880	3220000	group, Doug Blackiston. We have a collaboration through this new institute with Josh Bongard's lab
3220000	3224880	at the University of Vermont. And his student, Sam Kriegman, now a postdoc in my group.
3225680	3230240	And what they were doing is computational analysis of the following situation.
3230240	3235120	If you take cells and you liberate them from their normal environment, right, from the normal
3235120	3239200	set of instructive interactions that the other cells are telling them to do,
3239200	3243520	this larger network that has these bigger goals, would they reboot their multicellularity?
3243520	3248160	What would they do? Would they cooperate? And if so, what is it that they would build?
3248160	3254240	So we did this simple experiment. Here's a frog embryo. We take some skin cells off of the top
3254240	3258640	of this early embryo. So these are these are ectodermal cells. We dissociate them. And then we
3258640	3262720	put them in a little, in a little depression, you can, you can see that here. So basically,
3262720	3267040	we just dissociate them, and then we just pipet them down into this little hole. And so over the
3267040	3271920	next, over the next 24 hours, they will simply compact like this. Okay, you can see them,
3271920	3276400	they compact together, right? And then here, this is actually the flashing you see is actually
3276400	3280800	calcium signaling. It's some very interesting signaling dynamics, but they make this, this,
3280800	3284880	this round sort of thing. Now, they could have made lots of, they could have done lots of
3284880	3287360	different things. They could have crawled away from each other, they could have died,
3287360	3290960	they could have formed a monolayer, like you see in cell culture, could have done lots of things.
3290960	3296080	Instead, what they do is they form something we call a xenobot. Xenobot for Xenopus lavis,
3296080	3300880	that's the name of the frog, and it's a bio bot platform. So first of all, what you see here
3300880	3304720	is that they are self motile. So here it is swimming along, they have cilia the way the
3304720	3310400	reason they move is they have little, little hairs known as known as cilia that that they use to,
3311360	3316960	to, to, to row against, against the medium. And so, and so they, they, they swim along,
3316960	3322880	the cilia are normally used on the skin to, to move pathogens and mucus off of the, off of the
3322880	3326960	surface of the frog. And you can see here that, that they have all kinds of behaviors. This one
3326960	3332400	goes in the circle, this one sort of patrols back and forth, right? Here is some tracking data on
3332400	3336640	a group of them. This one's going on kind of a longer journey. This one is going in circles,
3336640	3343280	these two are interacting with each other. These skin cells normally are restricted to a very
3343280	3348240	boring two dimensional life sitting on the outside of a tackle by the rest, by the instructive
3348800	3353280	signals from the rest of the animal. When liberated from this, they, it turns out,
3353280	3358080	they have a completely different capacity to cooperate and make a new sort of little proto
3358080	3363840	animal. We didn't add anything, we didn't edit the genome, this is, we didn't induce, we didn't
3363840	3370400	put any, any trans genes, there are no nanomaterials. All we did was take something away. We took away
3370400	3375840	the restrictive instructive signals that the rest of the cells impose and we asked these
3375840	3379760	cells, what do they want to do? So now you're starting to see this, this, this multi-scale,
3381200	3385600	multi-scale competency architecture where the plasticities that, that I've been showing you
3385600	3389920	about being able to correct for all sorts of defects and so on is because all of the components
3390000	3394880	have their own agendas, which can be modified by the larger scale network that they're a part of,
3394880	3400560	but you can start to see this when, when some of those are lifted. Now here is, here it is in a
3400560	3405600	maze. This is filled with still water. So there's no water flow, it's completely closed. So you can
3405600	3411040	see it, it, it takes the corner without bumping into the edge. It then decides to turn around and
3411040	3416400	come back where it came from. Okay. So some sort of internal dynamic. So here it is, I'm swimming
3416400	3421120	along. It can, it can take this corner without having to bump into the opposite edge. So it
3421120	3426320	somehow knows that there's a possibility to take a corner here and then, and then it turns around.
3426320	3430000	We don't know why it turns around. They have all sorts of spontaneous behaviors, right, in this
3430000	3436080	system. They have the interesting capacity to regenerate themselves. So if you cut them in
3436080	3440320	half, this one was basically like pinched in half, you can see here over this 180 degree,
3440960	3446640	that hinge right there, right over that, that 180 degree, the forces, the forces must be, must be
3446640	3452160	really strong, but was able to do is able to try and fold itself back up into its new shape, into
3452160	3456960	its new xenobot shape. And if you actually pay attention to the calcium dynamics, you can see
3456960	3461120	it's very brain-like. They have, this is, you know, this is basically what, what calcium looks like
3461840	3466480	in, in, in brains. When you image living, living animals, there are no neurons here. This is just
3466480	3471760	skin. Everything that you've seen was just skin cells cooperating towards a new kind of morphology,
3471760	3477120	right? They have another very interesting behavior that we first saw. That's a kind of herding behavior
3477120	3482800	where they operate in groups like this and they, they, they do these kind of circular, these kind
3482800	3489040	of circular behaviors to make little piles. And, and why do they make little piles? Well, the most
3489040	3495920	amazing thing is that these little piles, if these little piles are themselves skin cells,
3496000	3500320	then what they will do is they will push them together into these little piles. Guess what the
3500320	3505520	little piles become? The little piles become the next generation of xenobots. So there's,
3505520	3508000	there's a couple of interesting things going on here. First of all,
3509440	3514240	this is a kind of replication. It's not a real lineage. They don't have strong heredity yet,
3514240	3521760	but it's a kind of replication because given components in the environment, they will make copies
3521760	3526720	of themselves. This is much closer to Von Neumann's idea of reproducing machines than to the way that
3526720	3530320	any other organism reproduces, right? So they will, they will go around, they will make, you know,
3530320	3534000	multiple generations of these little balls and the little balls become xenobots and continue the
3534000	3540160	cycle and keep doing it again and again. One interesting thing is that what's happened here
3540160	3545600	is that when we made it impossible for these cells to reproduce in their normal fashion,
3545600	3552560	within 48 hours, they have found a new way to pretty much do the same thing that has never
3552560	3556960	existed, as to our knowledge, never existed in evolution. No other, no other animal does this.
3556960	3562320	And so this is an amazing example, I think, an amazing example of problem solving and
3562320	3567120	plasticity. When you can't do things the original way, you can repurpose your existing hardware
3567120	3573360	to swim around to, and then to undergo behaviors that will actually do things that you can't do
3573360	3578800	the normal way. That's the first thing. The second thing to note here is that when we made these
3578800	3584400	xenobots, we, it was very much a collaboration between us and the cells themselves. We don't
3584400	3591680	know how to tell cells to assume a particular shape yet. All we were able to do was to remove some
3591680	3595600	constraints and put them in the new environment. The cells did all the rest after that, all the
3595600	3599840	heavy lifting. And we, and this is, this is very important because it's a new kind of
3600800	3605920	robotics and engineering where your material is not passive. It is not active. It's more than that.
3605920	3610720	It's an agential material, right? The new, I think the future of bioengineering is,
3610720	3616400	of engineering in general, is working with parts that are themselves some sort of simple,
3616400	3620320	or maybe not so simple, homeostatic agent. So that what you're doing is you're not engineering
3620320	3624320	the way we normally engineer. You micromanage every part. You have to know how to do everything.
3624320	3632320	You are actually signaling to, you know, you're trying to shift the way that your parts are
3632320	3636080	going to behave because they have their own behavior. And evolution does exactly that.
3636080	3640400	When these, when these bots make the next generation of bots, this only works because
3640400	3644800	the material they are working with, the cells that they are working with is itself an agential
3644800	3648400	material and is going to do the same things on its own. That's the only reason this works.
3649120	3653120	And that's, and the same is true of evolution. When you, when you try to change an organism,
3653120	3659120	you have to motivate and affect its guided self-assembly, the cells that you're working with.
3659120	3663360	They have their own, they have their own agendas. And so when you see these Xenobots,
3663360	3667760	they have a normal frog genome. And these Xenobots don't have a straightforward evolutionary
3667760	3673040	backstory. If you ask, why do Xenobots have a particular behavior and structure, the answer
3673040	3676880	is not because for millions of years they were selected to be good Xenobots. There's never
3676880	3682000	been any Xenobots. So the cells themselves were part of the evolutionary stream on Earth,
3682000	3686640	but they were selected for a completely different set of functions. So we really need to understand
3686640	3692640	how it is that evolution doesn't make, it doesn't find solutions to specific problems. It finds
3692640	3697760	machines that solve problems in novel ways. Right. So here's the, here's the unique developmental
3697760	3702000	sequence of a Xenobot. This is what normal frogs do. They are, they look like this and they look
3702000	3706080	like that. Then they run around like this. This is what Xenobots do. They make a, they make a body
3706080	3710560	like this. Eventually they will transition in, you know, two months later, they transition into
3710560	3714160	something that looks like that. Where does that come from? That's never existed before
3714160	3721440	during evolution. So just to close up, here's, here's the, the, the summary of what I tried to
3721440	3728160	say is that there is a framework which is really focused on a continuum of agency, not binary
3728160	3735440	categories. It's very engineering focused in terms of finding the best most appropriate models
3735440	3742160	for, to explain the scaling of, of cognition. The materials don't matter. There is no privileged
3742160	3748160	substrate. One useful way to think about systems is as the scale of goals that they are capable of,
3748960	3753680	of, of pursuing, we can think of intelligence as problem solving and abstract spaces.
3753680	3759200	And developmental bio electricity is a great way to start to look at how competent individuals
3759200	3763520	can scale their goals. And I think that's exactly what, what evolution did. And we can certainly
3763600	3769360	do that. Evolution is hugely potentiated, sped up by this kind of multi-scale competency
3769360	3773840	architecture. And the biggest, to me, one of the biggest questions going forward is,
3773840	3778480	where do these goals come from? It's not going to be selection. Where else can they come from?
3779120	3784640	And I just want to remind people that now with the new technologies, everything that every, every
3784640	3788640	organism you've ever heard of, right? Everything that Darwin meant when he said, endless forms,
3788640	3794720	most beautiful, all of that is a tiny little corner of this incredibly large state space of,
3794720	3801440	of cyborgs and hybrids and, and chimeras and all, all possible combinations of evolved material,
3802080	3808000	engineered material and artificial intelligence. And we're going to have to be able to relate in
3808000	3812800	some way to these things when we're not able to say what it is and what it's capable of based
3812800	3817440	on what it looks like and where it came from. So lots of, lots of papers on all these things.
3817440	3824080	I'm happy to send, send things out. These are the, the people that did all of the, the hard work
3824080	3828800	of the things that I showed you today. So I thank them. I thank our collaborators, our funders,
3828800	3834240	of course, and the model systems, which, which always do the heavy lifting. And I will stop here
3834320	3844080	and thank you. Okay.
3853600	3861120	Can you hear us, Michael? Yeah, yeah, okay. Well, amazing talk. What can I say? I'm, I'm really,
3861120	3866960	really impressed. I knew some of your research personally, but now that I see more, I want to
3866960	3875120	know more. Very, very nice attractor of topics. What we start with the question round. Anybody
3875120	3886480	has questions, comments? Yeah, Francis. Well, I think what this illustrates is that agency
3886480	3893920	is something very primitive in life. And agency is not just adaptation, as you say, to very specific
3893920	3901760	selective pressures, but it's adaptation to a wide range of things. So it's the plasticity,
3901760	3908000	it's the flexibility, it's the adaptivity that has been selected. So I assume that these cells
3908000	3913200	have some general agential behaviors, which adapt to the circumstances and when the circumstances
3913280	3919680	are very different, like in the case of these Xenobots, I assume there is still enough agency
3919680	3925520	left that they can do things that look kind of intelligent, even though they are completely
3925520	3933120	different from what they normally do. So it reinforces a little bit my proposal in my talk
3933120	3938400	that I said that the first step is of the salt maintenance. It's a zillions where zillions means
3938480	3944320	expanding your basin of attraction, it means expanding the space in which you can solve problems.
3944320	3949600	So what these things probably have learned a valuable time ago before they were folks,
3949600	3955360	is to expand this space for problems they could solve so that now if you take them out of their
3955360	3959920	normal space where they are in the folks body, they can still do things in this completely
3959920	3965200	different space because they have most this kind of generic agency you might want.
3965760	3973200	Yeah, I think that's absolutely correct. Of course, one of the big mysteries that we
3973200	3979920	now have to address, and we're doing this in computational models and at the bench,
3979920	3987840	is to really understand how evolution is able to produce this because the standard story is
3987840	3995120	that evolution is supposed to always pick the immediate short-term benefit and how it is that
3995600	4002240	it maximizes this incredible ability to problem solve instead of a very hard wire, and certainly
4002240	4005920	there are animals that act hardwired in various ways, you know, C. elegans and things like that,
4005920	4012640	but the majority are exactly as you just said, and so how that arises from evolutionary dynamics
4012640	4019040	that we're always told are very kind of short-sighted and always taking the immediate benefit,
4019040	4023120	it's not clear and that represents a huge area for research.
4024080	4028880	Well, my hypothesis is that when we think about evolution, we're thinking about
4028880	4033920	organisms that are already very highly specialized and then they are already so well
4033920	4038720	optimized for certain things that they can't afford to take risks to make too many changes,
4038720	4042720	but if you think about the origin of life and you think about all the catalytic systems
4042720	4049120	where there are all kinds of molecules coming and going and temperatures changing and water
4049120	4056000	entering and drying out, these very first thoughts, they had to be extremely non-specialized,
4056000	4062960	they had to be extremely resilient, they had to be extremely adaptive and probably these properties
4062960	4068800	are just properties that define life to have to get to the first living cells, you had to have this
4068800	4075600	extreme adaptivity and then once you had this more specialized organism, you didn't need
4075600	4079920	all these functions anymore, but they are still there because they can be the essence of life.
4085440	4097520	More comments, questions? No? Well, I have a little question here, this hand has a little question.
4098480	4101280	Oh, it's frozen even better.
4105760	4116000	So, as I understand, you are using the electrical field on the cell,
4117440	4123280	or what electrical what is the voltage, you measure the voltages, but what would be like the
4123280	4133120	real object that is being measured there? Yeah, what we're measuring is the voltage difference
4133120	4137680	between the inside and the outside of the cell, so every cell has a membrane and there's an
4137680	4142960	electrical potential between zero and let's say 80 millivolts, that's between the inside and the
4142960	4149520	outside, so what we're looking at is if you think about a neural network or an artificial neural
4149520	4156720	network where every node has an activation level, and so what we're looking at is the electrical
4156720	4163840	state of every individual cell, but that's not actually where the information is, the information
4163840	4171120	is in the flow of electrical computations through the whole network, so what we're measuring is the
4171120	4177920	spatial pattern and then over time we would take videos of each individual activation weight, it's
4177920	4186080	exactly like neuroscience except that the time is greatly slowed down, so you can take almost
4186080	4190960	any neuroscience paper and just do a fine to replace and Microsoft Word replace the words
4190960	4196080	neuron with the word cell, replace millisecond with hour and everything else basically works,
4196080	4203280	it's the same kind of thing. Yeah, so these patterns that are across multiple cells then
4203280	4208720	it's not the, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no that's critical, that's critical, it's not individual cells, yeah.
4208720	4216960	Yeah, yeah, yeah, so okay, so yeah, yeah, okay, and I have, sorry, sorry, did it,
4216960	4222960	when, yeah, yeah, but continue first. It's the, it's the, it's where I'm getting to the question, so,
4225520	4232080	so you are using now, there is this genetic information that is kind of like the hardware
4232080	4237920	you were mentioning, then you have the electrical field which is the electrical component which
4237920	4244880	encodes an extra mechanism which has been kind of like overlooked by evolutionary morphogenesis or
4244880	4253280	like by the fields you were mentioning and then I wonder, like this is, my wonder is like
4253680	4261440	might there be other forces at play? Have you have, have you studied or measured or why would
4261440	4268560	have to be only electrical? So, so that's the, since there are many other physical quantities
4268560	4275120	that might have similar dynamics and play a role in transmission and so on. Sure, sure, sure,
4275120	4279760	there, there are many others and many people study them, there's biomechanical forces,
4280480	4284480	there is ultra-weak photon emission, there are of course chemical gradients that everybody
4284480	4289840	studies, all of these exist. My claim is not that they're not important or that bioelectricity
4289840	4295600	does everything, no, but, but bioelectricity is where the only data that I know of has been
4296400	4301840	obtained where those bioelectrical dynamics are actually the memory medium of this collective
4301840	4305840	intelligence. It's possible that, you know, 10 years from now somebody will find out that the
4305840	4310240	biomechanical stress patterns are also storing the same thing, entirely possible, but it hasn't
4310240	4314560	been done. The only, you know, these other, these other forces have been treated as,
4315600	4321120	as pieces of physics at the lowest level that need to be tracked to, to understand the system
4321120	4325520	and their bioelectricity is exactly like all these others, but what we have shown, I think,
4325520	4332640	is that bioelectricity has a really important role as the, as the, as the actual medium of the
4332640	4337200	computation. So it's like, you know, you can look at a computer and okay, yep, there are stress
4337200	4343200	forces, there are vibrations, there are, you know, heat gradients, all kinds of things going on, but
4343200	4348880	if you want to really understand what computations they're doing, the bioelectric, the, you know,
4348880	4355520	the electric patterns through the circuits have a privileged status and maybe these other modalities
4355520	4360160	will have the same thing. It's entirely possible, maybe evolution uses them all, but it's, but it's
4360160	4365280	not known. It's only known at this point for the bioelectrics. Yeah, yeah, that was my, my question.
4365280	4373680	Please do it. Yeah, very amazing talk, first of all, and I knew your work already, so, but okay,
4373680	4381600	it was nice to see all these little details explained carefully. No, I, I, I'm a counter
4381600	4389920	physicist. So electricity is, is thought over. So in a certain way, I wonder actually,
4391120	4397200	certainly because you have this memory effect. So there is something new being revealed here,
4397200	4405280	I think, that has not been really identified. And that is difficult to, to explain out of Darwinian
4405280	4411360	evolution, even in, in, in an easy way at least in a straightforward way. Well, that's also the
4411360	4420960	message which was a little bit in your talk, I think. So I wonder whether, because it would be too
4420960	4426560	long to, to, to tell you the details now, but I could send you some, some, some material there. But
4426560	4431760	let's say we are working on, on an integration of quantum physics where this would fit in in some
4431760	4440160	way, you see, that would be things happening on the quantum level in, in, in, in, in photon clouds,
4440720	4450480	which, which, which were not, which not have been revealed yet, yet clearly that have to do with,
4450480	4459520	with meaning, meaning that would be stored in, in, in light in some way. And so, so it's amazing,
4459520	4464320	it's amazing, these experiments. Thank you. I knew them already. So it was not the first time that
4464320	4470880	I saw them. But let's say that. Yeah. Yeah, I'd be very happy to, yeah, please send me, yeah, send
4470880	4476160	me, send me what you have. I will send you an email because this would take too long to make
4476160	4482880	my own explanation. Exactly the kind of things that we want to, want to happen, that we connect
4482880	4489440	with each other and also the online audience can also bring, bring connections. And why not keep,
4489440	4494800	keep discussing. I'm totally interested in this. And I know some people who will be interested too.
4494800	4501040	So I'm kind of new to the topic, but it's extremely, extremely interesting as for me as well. Please,
4501040	4507040	Francis. Another thing that I find very interesting in your work I had heard about it is before this
4507040	4512880	idea of the cognitive boundary, where you use the metaphor of the light cone, but I'm not sure
4512880	4519280	that's a very good metaphor because the light kind of extends in this way while yours comes together
4519280	4525760	so maybe more something like a cognitive horizon, I would say the horizon is as far as you can see.
4525760	4531120	And I personally have been using the concept already for years of prospect, the prospect is
4531120	4537200	what you can see ahead of you and what you can imagine to be good or bad. So prospect is both
4537200	4544640	an anticipation and a notion of good or bad or value. The prospect is the things you see
4544640	4550320	potentially that you may go to or that you may want to avoid. And I think your notion of cognitive
4550320	4555760	bond is very similar to my notion of prospect. And indeed, the term in evolution, you might say,
4555760	4562400	is to extant the prospect because the larger the prospect, the easier it becomes to find something
4562400	4568480	valuable to go towards a goal that is worthwhile and the easier it also becomes to see the potential
4568480	4577360	dangers and to avoid them. So I just heard a commentary about Théâtre de Chardin, who had
4577360	4583040	a kind of a mystical philosophy, but he had very good intuitions. He had this law of complexity
4583040	4588240	consciousness where he says during evolution, complexity and consciousness increase at the
4588240	4592640	same time. And this notion of consciousness was a little bit like this notion of the cognitive
4592640	4599520	boundary. As evolution progresses, the systems can see farther and can see wider around them.
4599520	4605680	And that comes with the idea of the north here, by the internet. Now we can all in a sense see
4605680	4611200	what's happening all around the world. So it's this extension of the cognitive boundary. I think
4611200	4614880	all what I call prospect, I think that's a very important idea.
4615600	4623600	Yeah, I agree. Can I say something? Can you hear me? I can hear you. Yeah. Yeah. Great.
4624720	4632160	Thank you very much. Yes, for this amazing talk. I just want to make a make a make a notion in
4632160	4639920	terms of interdisciplinarity. Because what you said, I find super interesting and super
4639920	4646640	amazing where where is the shape defined or located in the first place? This is the one
4647280	4654560	question you put in the the other one was how does it the system knows when it is right,
4654560	4659920	the the the forming of the shape and these two questions are exactly the crucial crucial
4659920	4665680	questions in in design in the in the artistic process. So this did really strike me when you
4666640	4670880	were saying this. So where are these and is it possible to find these set points?
4671680	4677680	And so I think this this this this happens on on on on many different levels. These I think these
4677680	4685360	are two very, very deep and important questions. This is just what I want to to to say. Yeah.
4686560	4690880	Really, thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah, I took a bunch of notes during your talk. So I will
4690880	4695760	be I will be emailing you afterwards. I completely agree. There are some nice nice similarities
4695760	4705840	here. Yeah, great. Thank you. Okay, amazing. Then we will take a little break and have some coffee
4705840	4712240	on this side of the of the universe. And then we'll see you back for our last talk, where
4712320	4719920	Maximiliano Sanin will tell us about transport networks and why they modeling is the wrong way.
4721200	4726320	So I will stop the recording now and then stop the call so the videos can be
4726320	4733600	generated. So see you in nearly 15 minutes. Okay, thank you guys. Until soon. Thanks, Michael.
