00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
We will start the seminar. I think most people know me here. I'm Francis Heligand. I'm presently the director of the Centre-LÃ©on Apostle.

00:11.000 --> 00:24.000
And I'm going to talk about a topic which I consider to be very important. Of course, you would like to believe that all the topics you speak about are important, but this one for me is more important than other talks I have given in the centre.

00:24.000 --> 00:39.000
I think it's a kind of a unification of a very large number of things I have been doing and not only a unification of things I have been doing, but as I hope to argue, a unification actually potentially for the whole of science.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
That's why I call it a new ontology for a transdisciplinary unification.

00:45.000 --> 00:59.000
So relational agency, it's a recent term. I'm not 100% sure that I will stick to that term. There may be better terms, but I think it captures very well what this new ontology is about.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
So let me start by saying what is an ontology.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Okay.

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
So, starting with the term ontology, which may not be common to everybody.

01:16.000 --> 01:24.000
So an ontology originally was a term in philosophy that was speaking about being on the things that exist.

01:24.000 --> 01:44.000
More practically an ontology is a theory about the fundamental constituents of reality. Whatever world you have, you assume that reality is constituted at the basis of something extremely fundamental, the essential, the elements or the building blocks of the things that exist.

01:44.000 --> 01:53.000
So any kind of a worldview or metaphysics must have an ontology at its foundations and often the ontology is implicit.

01:53.000 --> 02:03.000
But lately, more and more people are interested in looking explicitly at ontology because changing the ontology changes your whole worldview.

02:03.000 --> 02:17.000
So there are some classical ontologies, for example, materialism is that the idea that at the bottom everything consists of matter, but then there is idealism that says no in the end everything consists of ideas.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
And there are some other versions like social constructivism where everything after all is a social construction.

02:24.000 --> 02:37.000
I'm not going to detail the different ontologies that exist, but go to the ontology which is kind of the most standard, the most default one, the most classical Western ontology.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Not that I claim that this is purely Western.

02:41.000 --> 02:50.000
This ontology I'm pretty sure also in other world views, but it's the one that we associate it most with the scientific Western world view.

02:50.000 --> 03:01.000
And more specifically by what I have called in my research, the Newtonian world view, the Newtonian world view that meets the world view of classical mechanics.

03:01.000 --> 03:15.000
And this ontology is implicitly since most scientific theories later developed on the basis of this Newtonian world view, most scientific theories kind of implicitly assume this ontology.

03:15.000 --> 03:27.000
And this ontology why is it so widespread, because it's simple, because it's concrete, because it's intuitive, and because you can express it very nicely in mathematical ways.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
And that's what I call the ontology of objects.

03:31.000 --> 03:39.000
So, we can say that as the whole Western world view originated really with the ancient Greeks.

03:39.000 --> 03:55.000
These two come from ancient Greek philosophy, and one philosopher there was Parmenides, who had something against change, who was saying that change is an illusion, the only thing that exists are eternal permanent things.

03:55.000 --> 04:06.000
Prater was looking at these eternal permanent things as what he called absolute forms, IDs, so the IDs are there eternally.

04:06.000 --> 04:14.000
And finally you had Aristotle, who was a student of Prater and Aristotle was more practical was more empirically minded.

04:14.000 --> 04:27.000
He of course was not going to deny that objects could change, but he still kept his idea of the absolute essential form by speaking about objects having essential properties.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
So the essential properties, the essences are what define the object.

04:32.000 --> 04:41.000
So this is the ontology of objects, you have objects that have certain essences that are in there.

04:41.000 --> 04:50.000
So let's look at it more concretely, I have chosen here a picture of a break as kind of a default prototypical object.

04:50.000 --> 05:03.000
What is this prototypical object, it's a thing that is this thing that means we can very clearly see where it begins and where it ends, it's located in space there is a border around it.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
And it is inert, it just sits there.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
It's independent, it's absolute, it just is.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
It doesn't do anything or less some force moves it.

05:18.000 --> 05:27.000
So what is standard object have as property is they just remain the way they are they have these essential properties.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
They remain identical to themselves they keep these properties.

05:31.000 --> 05:44.000
And of course we want to describe change and not all things are static in the world. So, what Aristotle did to solve that problem is that he distinguished between the essential properties the ones that do not change.

05:44.000 --> 05:59.000
And what he called the accidental properties. And with accidental properties we think about things like the position of that break, or the speed with which you throw it so you can imagine that that break is moved in different orientations.

05:59.000 --> 06:07.000
The position or the position with the witness, it's accidental, it's not essential, it does not define the break.

06:07.000 --> 06:18.000
And if those accidental properties change, that is because something else, namely some outside force such as gravity has made the big move from one position to the own.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
So the ontology of objects assume that objects are just their passive, they do not change on their own.

06:25.000 --> 06:44.000
So, after Aristotle this ontology has developed further in the direction of materialism, and that is the ID objects are made from an inner substance a substance is kind of what carries the object, what shapes the object.

06:44.000 --> 06:53.000
Substances can be remodelled or rearranged but the substances are assumed to be eternal to be always the same.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
So a substance is something that just is there, it can't be created, can't be destroyed, it can't be transformed.

07:00.000 --> 07:09.000
In our modern scientific world we assume that the fundamental substance of the world is what we call matter, so it's a materialistic world view.

07:09.000 --> 07:19.000
And we assume that matter ultimately consists of particles which are kind of the smallest objects, the elementary units, the smallest possible objects.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
So that's the basis of our traditional world view.

07:24.000 --> 07:37.000
In this world view also entails this what we know as reductionism which does that, yeah, if everything consists of objects and objects themselves consist of smaller objects and these smaller objects, eventually consist of particles.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Well, actually that's all there is.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
If you want to understand something.

07:42.000 --> 07:58.000
You can get it as some arrangement or assembly of particles. And if you want to know what happens to that object, you just need to look at what these particles are doing, meaning how they are moving in space and time.

07:58.000 --> 08:12.000
Why do they move, because there are forces, and there we have the essence of the Newtonian world view, you have massive objects that move under the influence of forces, such as gravity.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
So in such a world view, yeah, actually you can't really have anything new.

08:19.000 --> 08:32.000
Everything exists just out of these bits of matter, which are essentially identical, you may be rearranging them but nothing novel can emerge, there can be no evolution, there can be no creativity.

08:32.000 --> 08:48.000
And moreover, in the Newtonian world view, you assume that all these changes, that's to say the forces acting on these objects, they are deterministic so there is no uncertainty, there is no indeterminacy, there is no freedom, and therefore there also cannot be

08:48.000 --> 09:00.000
something like autonomy, free will or agency, objects cannot decide how they will react, they just are passively subjected to these forces.

09:00.000 --> 09:16.000
So there the logical structure is consistent, we have all these objects subjected to forces, we can explain lots of things in terms of objects and particles, but then there is one thing which we clearly cannot explain.

09:16.000 --> 09:33.000
Namely, if we assume that there are human observers who are looking at those objects and doing things with those objects, then we need to assume that these humans have something that the objects don't have, namely that these humans have agency that they are autonomous free

09:33.000 --> 09:49.000
who can decide, consciously decide what they are going to do, so the brick may be subjective passively to the force of gravity, but I as a human can decide whether or not I will throw the brick or put the brick here or there.

09:49.000 --> 10:07.000
So then we get that, that was the solution of the cat to that problem that humans must have something else, something that is not that matter, they must have some kind of a substance that he called mind, which led to the philosophy of mind,

10:07.000 --> 10:24.000
whether dualism or mind body dualism, there is the mind which is something not material, and then there are the material objects, but immediately that creates a problem which is known as the mind body problem, if we assume that the body is material.

10:24.000 --> 10:45.000
The material particles in the body are subjected to deterministic forces, while the mind has a free will and can interact with the body, then how can that be, it's a contradiction, either the matter is subjected to deterministic forces, or it's subjected to the free will of the mind it

10:45.000 --> 10:55.000
is not about, so we have a problem there which is an unsolvable paradox that lots of philosophers have been lamented about.

10:55.000 --> 11:11.000
So, for me, this paradox the only way to solve this is that you really need a different ontology, you should not make the distinction between passive objects, and active, a gentle minds that nobody understands quite what they are.

11:11.000 --> 11:18.000
And that brings me to a different ontology that is also pretty old, that is the process ontology.

11:18.000 --> 11:28.000
The process ontology against primal illness, we said that change is an illusion, process ontology on the contrary says change is the most basic thing.

11:28.000 --> 11:49.000
The reality is not constituted out of static object, but out of things that change out of processes. And that is an old philosophy, it actually dates from before the Socratic philosophers before Pyramidus, and the best representative in Greek philosophy is Heraclitus,

11:49.000 --> 12:05.000
who is famous with his statement that you can never step in the same river twice, a river is not a thing, it's not an object, a river is a flow, every time you step into the river, it's a different water that you're stepping in, but there is still this river.

12:05.000 --> 12:18.000
And we see similar philosophies in Eastern philosophy, for example in Taoism, where you have this idea of the Tao as a kind of a flow that describes reality.

12:19.000 --> 12:37.000
These ideas have been picked up in 20th century philosophy by a number of philosophers like Whitehead, ThÃ©Ã¢tre de Chardin and Bergson, but they have never really made much impact on science and I will later explain why that is.

12:37.000 --> 12:47.000
So, rather than immediately going into this abstract process philosophy, I first want to come back to something that's even earlier than the Socratic philosophers.

12:47.000 --> 13:06.000
And that is animism, animism is not an official philosophy, it's a way of describing how hunter-gatherers look at the world, it's a concept that was produced by anthropologists who were studying hunter-gatherers and who noticed that they tended to see

13:06.000 --> 13:14.000
all the phenomena around them, the plants, the animals, the trees, the clouds, the rivers as animated.

13:14.000 --> 13:35.000
That means they saw them as agents, not as passive objects, but as agents that have some spirit of their own and therefore the hunter-gatherers live, you might say, in harmony with nature in the sense that they see themselves as being imaged in this network of relationships.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
They have relationships with all these natural agents.

13:39.000 --> 14:02.000
Now, there are different attitudes towards animism and the traditional view in anthropology is that while animism is just some very primitive, naive view, a pre-scientific view where people attribute supernatural characteristics to these material objects.

14:02.000 --> 14:15.000
They kind of tend to think that there is some kind of a spirit living in the tree and it's all very naive, it's just a projection of the internal theory of mind on those external things.

14:15.000 --> 14:33.000
But since recently, since about 20 years, there's a new view developing in anthropology by anthropologists such as Noyd, Burt, David, Tim Ingold and Gavin Gehm-Harvey, who look at animism in a much more pragmatic manner.

14:33.000 --> 14:41.000
That's to say, for them, animism is a natural way of adapting to the ecosystem in which you live.

14:41.000 --> 15:00.000
That means understanding the ecosystem as indeed a network of agents and in which you as a human are just one of the agents among many, and you try to form good positive relationship with those agents.

15:00.000 --> 15:12.000
And this is kind of a little bit of a symbolic depiction of animism. It's the idea that the tree is not just a piece of wood, but it has some kind of a spirit.

15:12.000 --> 15:29.000
But we need to understand spirit here as that what animates it, not so much as some supernatural soul-like entity, the way it is depicted in dualistic philosophies, where there is the mind of the tree and there is the material of the tree,

15:29.000 --> 15:44.000
where the two are separable, that dualism isn't there in animism. The spirit of the tree is in the tree, it's not something that you can take out of it and that you can see in some kind of a supernatural realm.

15:44.000 --> 15:57.000
If animism is indeed this kind of very natural, intuitive way of relating to the world, then a good question to ask is, why are we no longer animists?

15:57.000 --> 16:13.000
And many people nowadays, especially with ecological movement, have kind of lamented that we have lost our connection with nature, that people no longer have this kind of intuitive empathy with trees and with clouds and with rivers.

16:13.000 --> 16:39.000
And that affects a lot of our modern problems of scarcity, exhaustion, pollution, can be explained by that because we treat nature no longer as a collection of agents with whom we are interrelated, we are treating it just as a bunch of raw materials of objects that are just there to be consumed and to be transformed whatever way we see fit.

16:39.000 --> 16:59.000
Now I have discovered an extremely interesting author who is not that well known, that's why I want to emphasize that it's worth reading him, who is called David Abram, who is an anthropologist who has done some field studies in different countries.

16:59.000 --> 17:21.000
Yeah, he's not a very traditional scientific anthropologist, he's more kind of what you might call an eco-philosophy, that means he tries to get into the mindset of these people he has been observing and he himself tries to recreate that kind of animistic consciousness.

17:21.000 --> 17:36.000
He has published two books that are both written, which I made lots of different markings so that it gives you kind of a sign of how much they inspired me, and the titles kind of speak for themselves.

17:36.000 --> 17:51.000
This first book is The Spell of the Sun, so he speaks about this sensuous, this embodied sensation of being in the world in nature and participating, feeling the wind, feeling the trees, hearing the birds.

17:51.000 --> 18:10.000
And the other one he calls an becoming animal, yeah, it's recovering this sensitivity that animals have where animals walk to the woods and they will notice the slightest changes and noises that we westerners when we walk to the woods we will just ignore.

18:11.000 --> 18:23.000
Now what's also interesting about Abram is that not only he gives you a sense of what this original animistic consciousness was, but he also has a hypothesis of why we lost that.

18:23.000 --> 18:48.000
So his hypothesis, I'm not sure it explains everything but it's definitely words looking at is that we lost this consciousness when the invention of alphabetic writing, something that we get from the Hebrews and the Greeks and why is that by writing what you do is you describe something with a word but the word is disconnected from the thing.

18:48.000 --> 19:00.000
The word just stays there, it's in a book, it goes into a library, it loses completely the connection with the context and a word by definition is something static.

19:00.000 --> 19:10.000
Words do not change when you open your book it's still the same words in there, while the tree that the word refers to the tree will have changed in the meantime.

19:10.000 --> 19:30.000
His idea is that when Plato started thinking in terms of essences, Plato was one of the first philosophers who was really using littered material was really using texts, that Plato kind of had this idea of eternal forms essences by looking at words.

19:30.000 --> 19:46.000
And then when you go further and you start expressing these things not only in words but in mathematical formulas and you completely cut out the context, which means you make kind of a static abstract representation of it that is unchanging.

19:46.000 --> 20:05.000
Now another aspect that is definitely very important also is that since Plato and even more since the hunter gathers, we are living in an artificial environment that means an environment mostly consists of artifacts, artifacts like cups and cups are passive objects.

20:05.000 --> 20:24.000
There is nothing animated or a gentle in a cup, while in a piece of wood, you may say okay it's just a piece of wood, but if you come back two months later that piece of wood may have been eaten by alz or it may have eroded or it may have changed color.

20:24.000 --> 20:38.000
There are differences between natural materials that are constantly adapting to circumstances and things like cups and all kind of artifacts. And if you look at this room here, there's nothing animated in here except people.

20:38.000 --> 20:54.000
This dualistic worldview, it's logical that we make a distinction between material objects that are just passive like this, this table and animated people, which are all the rest, and there's nothing in between.

20:54.000 --> 21:02.000
But if you look outside the window then you see the trees and then you see other things except objects and people.

21:02.000 --> 21:21.000
So, I'm not the only person and Abraham is not the only person who has been thinking in this direction, and I might even say that there is a tendency now in science and philosophy to have a certain innocence of animism.

21:21.000 --> 21:35.000
I will first look at the domain that I know best, the scientific models of agency and what is now very common are so called agent based models, what's an agent based model.

21:35.000 --> 21:59.000
The computer simulation of some complex system could be a market could be a society could be an ecosystem. And you do that by defining agents where agents are entities that follow certain rules, and they interact with each other and with the environment to these rules.

21:59.000 --> 22:14.000
The dimensions of course are abstractions, but because each agent acts on its own, and then interacts with the other. What you see is that the whole tends to develop very complex dynamics.

22:14.000 --> 22:25.000
And then we come into the domain that has been called complex adaptive systems you see that these networks of agents start to self organize, and they develop all kind of emergent properties.

22:25.000 --> 22:44.000
And this is an attempt that has been going on I would say at least for 30 years in the physical sciences in the computer sciences, but also in the social sciences and the humanities there is a certain revival of this, what I would call animistics spirit.

22:44.000 --> 23:01.000
Also, there we see models of agents in networks and probably the most famous one is the actor network theory that was developed among others by the sociologist Bruno Latour, and I don't remember his first name Albert Cuyol.

23:01.000 --> 23:13.000
What they do is they analyze complex social evolution as an interplay between many different what they call actors, but the actors are not just humans.

23:13.000 --> 23:20.000
The actors can be institutions they can be technologies they can be even physical resources like uranium.

23:20.000 --> 23:33.000
All of these are actors in the sense that their actions will have an effect on how this network develops, and what is coming out of it.

23:33.000 --> 23:44.000
And this is not really my specialty but he has been here in the audience has worked on that the idea of the parliament of things.

23:44.000 --> 24:04.000
There is not reason in that thing. In this reason you start to say well all these non human actors, maybe they also have some say maybe they should, we should give them some rights, and they have for example be attempts to give legal rights to rivers that has been a case like that that I know in New Zealand.

24:04.000 --> 24:24.000
And that's one part of the influences of this new paradigm. And then there is a paradigm more in the humanities and in the so called cultural and critical studies that is called post humanism, which some of the authors are the famous Donna Haraway and Karen Barrett.

24:24.000 --> 24:38.000
And here the idea that humanism puts humans central is the old idea of the cat, you have the humans that are rational, and that have this mind, and they are different from everything else.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
They're different from the animals they're different from technologies, they are unique.

24:43.000 --> 24:58.000
So post humanism says we should no longer take humans as the central part of everything humans are just one among many, and the border, the bond is between what is human and what is not human are often fuzzy.

24:58.000 --> 25:08.000
And I think, for example, at technologies that support us, we become like cyborgs. And also if you think about symbiosis between humans and animals.

25:08.000 --> 25:25.000
We can't just say that the human is a separate individual. So, what you need to do is to blur these boundaries between humans and the rest of the world and see humans as just one among many agents that are all living symbiotically.

25:26.000 --> 25:39.000
So, all these movements they're going in the same direction but at the moment, you can't say that there is a really an integrated theory.

25:39.000 --> 25:54.000
Each of these have different terminologies have different concept they have different assumptions they come from different traditions, like for example very simple idea that you speak about agents in the one and you speak about actors in the other.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
You speak about individuals.

25:59.000 --> 26:13.000
Obviously, there is a lot of incoherence still. So, what I'm trying to propose here is to unify the different approaches by developing a common ontology.

26:13.000 --> 26:20.000
So we said that an ontology is a set of building blocks conceptual building blocks.

26:20.000 --> 26:37.000
And we don't want to lose the ability of science to make mathematical models so we should ideally have buildings books conceptual building books that can also be formalize at least can be put into mathematical formulas that can be used for computer simulation.

26:37.000 --> 26:48.000
So that is why I propose my new ontology which I call relational agency, and which is an extension of the process ontology.

26:48.000 --> 27:08.000
Why do we need an extension of the process ontology. Well, if we look at the process metaphysics in the work of people like Whitehead and Berg so we see lots of inspiring ideas but we don't see very clearly, concretely applicable things.

27:08.000 --> 27:15.000
These existing theories, they tend to be quite obscure, complicated, fake abstract.

27:15.000 --> 27:34.000
They're also not, they also don't have a very clear definition, they say that everything is a process but then what is the process, then typical examples are kind of a process of evolution or process of development but these are incredibly complex processes where you can't really say where they begin or answer.

27:34.000 --> 27:50.000
It's very difficult to model. So that is, I think why this process philosophies have not yet had much impact in science, because you can't, you don't know very well how to implement them, how to model them, how to analyze them.

27:50.000 --> 28:03.000
And I propose an instance of starting from guns processes without borders. Let's start from the equivalent of elementary particles that we will call this elementary processes.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
And these processes is elementary processes I call reactions.

28:08.000 --> 28:20.000
These are our building blocks, and then when we need to go to more complex things and we will just build up more complex things as networks of such reactions.

28:20.000 --> 28:27.000
So, a little bit for the people maybe with a background in physics.

28:27.000 --> 28:36.000
When you go to quantum to you you see that actually these kind of elementary processes of these elementary actions are really the basis of everything.

28:36.000 --> 28:49.000
So already the traditional quantum mechanics tells you that particles are not objects, the way we imagine them. They don't have essential properties that just are there.

28:49.000 --> 28:58.000
Properties of particles, you, they get their properties to observations and what's an observation, it's an interaction.

28:58.000 --> 29:14.000
And do not interact or do not act in quantum mechanics, they don't really have properties they don't even have a position in space in quantum mechanics you can't say that an electron is located in a particular position, it's only after you make an observation

29:14.000 --> 29:22.000
you can't say, ah, it's there. But the moment after the observation, it has again diffuse and it's no longer there.

29:22.000 --> 29:31.000
So that's already quantum mechanics we tells you that the properties of objects are not stable they're not permanent they're not absolute.

29:31.000 --> 29:46.000
But the quantum field theory you come to the conclusion that even the objects themselves are not stable because particles are merely instantiations of fields and fields are descriptions of potential interactions.

29:46.000 --> 29:54.000
The particles in quantum field theory, they are being destroyed by being created, they're being transformed.

29:54.000 --> 30:06.000
So, if people need convincing that elementary processes are more fundamental than particles, I think quantum filter is the good reason.

30:06.000 --> 30:21.000
Because quantum filter is the most fundamental theory we have in physics, and it's also the most accurate one because there are attempts to make more fundamental theories like string theory but these theories simply don't make any predictions whatsoever.

30:21.000 --> 30:28.000
Or quantum filter makes very precise prediction that turned out to be very precisely correct.

30:28.000 --> 30:40.000
So by defining these elementary reactions and this elementary reactions, I will use a formalism that is so simple that really, I mean a child could learn it.

30:40.000 --> 30:49.000
So I want to have a formalism or language which is transdisciplinary can be applied to all possible cases.

30:49.000 --> 31:06.000
So some of my languages of my language are what I call conditions, sometimes they also use other names like components or molecules, and the reactions that change conditions so what is the condition a condition is something that you can distinguish.

31:06.000 --> 31:16.000
A condition could be its light or its dark and a reaction then is something that changes that condition.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
You can see here the reaction.

31:21.000 --> 31:28.000
L a that means something brings a into existence a appears.

31:28.000 --> 31:35.000
I could, for example, say, I'm in the dark, and suddenly there is light a appears.

31:35.000 --> 31:44.000
It's kind of like the simplest possible process you could imagine something distinguishable emerges appears.

31:44.000 --> 31:58.000
So if something appears you can also disappear. That's the second case here a followed by an arrow a goes into emptiness a disappears if there was light and suddenly the light is switched off then the light is gone.

31:58.000 --> 32:05.000
Of course that's not very interesting if you want to describe networks, you will need to have some relations between conditions.

32:05.000 --> 32:16.000
So the next simplest reaction is a leads to be, which means I start in condition a and I go to condition be.

32:16.000 --> 32:30.000
Maybe I go to form a situation where there is a little bit of light and then I go to a situation with a lot of light or maybe I go from a situation where there is yellow light and then the light changes into blue.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
It's all very simple to get to the full power of the formalism.

32:35.000 --> 32:55.000
You need to do to use a notation that is used in chemistry and in physics to describe elementary actions that is the A plus big if C plus the A plus B means a and B are both there, a conjunction of a and B, there are two conditions.

32:55.000 --> 33:13.000
If these two conditions are there at the same time, then some other conditions will appear, for example, a leads to be could be the condition is dark clouds are gathering the process is, it starts raining.

33:13.000 --> 33:24.000
So if I have two conditions if I have dark clouds are gathering and people are in the street, then it starts to rain and people will seek shelter.

33:24.000 --> 33:29.000
So the process are just saying that you have two conditions.

33:29.000 --> 33:40.000
And this level of formalism already allows me to define elementary agent, an agent is something that makes a process happen.

33:40.000 --> 33:52.000
So the agent is the one that performs an action if you wish, that means that makes the process happen, and I can describe it here in this formalism I use see as an agent.

33:52.000 --> 33:59.000
So A plus C turns into B plus C, that means the C still is there.

33:59.000 --> 34:20.000
But the A is transformed into B, the C is a necessary condition to turn the A into a B, so C enables the reaction in the language of chemistry, C is a catalyst, a catalyst in chemistry is a molecule that makes a reaction happen, but that is not itself affected by the reaction.

34:20.000 --> 34:35.000
So this catalyst C can be seen as the agent turning a into B, and the reaction that it performs can be interpreted as what in artificial intelligence is sometimes called a condition action rule.

34:35.000 --> 34:49.000
That means the agent is sensitive to particular condition namely sensitive to the condition a, and when it never it is confronted with condition a, it will perform an action that turns this a into B.

34:49.000 --> 35:05.000
So one agent can catalyze a reaction turning a into B, but it would also turn C into F, E into F, F and G together into H, B into E.

35:05.000 --> 35:15.000
So generally an agent will catalyze different reaction that means an agent can perform different actions, and which action it will perform will depend on the initial conditions.

35:15.000 --> 35:31.000
So if there is A, the agent will produce B, if there is B, the agent will produce E, if there is E, the agent will produce F, if there is F and there is also G, then the agent will produce H.

35:31.000 --> 35:49.000
Agents have these kind of properties. It's particles, molecules are agents in that sense. Agents will react with certain things, and depending on what kind of agent it is, it will perform certain reactions and not others.

35:49.000 --> 36:08.000
So agents have this kind of identity of being able to perform certain actions. Now, if you take all the reactions that an agent can perform together, they form what they form what in physics or mathematics is called a dynamical system.

36:08.000 --> 36:22.000
The dynamical system is the equivalence of a force that means something that pushes things in a particular direction. It takes the A's turns them into B's, it takes the B's turns them into E's etc.

36:22.000 --> 36:28.000
So it is pushing things. A dynamical system is something that pushes things in a certain direction.

36:28.000 --> 36:41.000
Since we know that dynamical systems typically have attractors, that means that they push things into a region, but they don't push them out of that region, so they kind of accumulate in this attractor region.

36:41.000 --> 36:55.000
And we can interpret that very simply that attractor is like the agent goal. The goal of the agent is to move whatever is there into this region.

36:55.000 --> 37:14.000
Now, catalyst agent in that sense they play a little bit the role of the objects or the forces in the old ontology objects in the sense that they don't change during the reactions forces in the sense that they have an effect on the things they react with, but

37:14.000 --> 37:21.000
they're not assumed to be eternal. They're not assumed to have these essential properties that remain forever.

37:21.000 --> 37:31.000
Agents are just conditions like all the others which mean that there are certain reactions that destroy agents that consume agents that build agents.

37:31.000 --> 37:47.000
Agents can play the role of objects and forces in the old ontology but they have this inbuilt dynamism they can change into something else they are not given you don't need to make this assumption that objects always need to be there.

37:47.000 --> 37:59.000
Now if you reason in terms of natural selection you see this network of all kinds of reactions and reactions are constantly turning things into other things.

38:00.000 --> 38:10.000
What remains after a while well all these things that are turned into other things are no longer there, but some things are not being turned into other things.

38:10.000 --> 38:19.000
And so after a while, the ones that will remain are the ones where the available reactions are not turning them into other things.

38:19.000 --> 38:25.000
So, the existence of things like stable particles.

38:25.000 --> 38:39.000
So that's an effect of natural selection. In elementary particle physics you have lots, you have a zoo of hundreds of different particles and most of these particles are very unstable.

38:39.000 --> 38:48.000
That mean they react with some other particle turning to two new particles which in turn fall apart or turn into new particles.

38:48.000 --> 38:54.000
But from time to time you could produce a very stable particle like a proton.

38:54.000 --> 39:07.000
And then, yeah, then the whole universe gets filled up with protons and gets filled up with neutrons, and these protons and neutrons from atoms and these atoms are also quite stable.

39:07.000 --> 39:22.000
You just let the reaction soon after a while you stick typically with the most stable was there's a natural selection of the most stable one that explains why even though the world is at core a big process.

39:22.000 --> 39:31.000
This process tends to produce locally stable entities that we call elementary agents.

39:31.000 --> 39:50.000
In elementary agents like stable particles, they're not very interesting. When we think about agency more in the style of human agency we're thinking about something that we make all auto poetic agent so an auto poetic agent for music kind of a generalization of a living agent,

39:50.000 --> 40:05.000
a living organism. Now what's the difference between a living agent and one of these physical agents like particles that is that a living agent is constituted out of processes.

40:05.000 --> 40:18.000
The processes are going on. It's not a stable particle. It's particles that are being transformed into other particles are being transformed into other particles, but the whole is stable.

40:18.000 --> 40:32.000
And here I have kind of thought of the simplest possible instantiation of such an auto poetic agent is an a turns into a B and a B turns into an a so they are forming each other.

40:32.000 --> 40:44.000
And typically because there is always some losses because of thermodynamics some of the bees get lost some of the bees disappear and to replenish that you need to have some input of ace.

40:44.000 --> 40:51.000
So, if you imagine this cycle a B as a simple living system.

40:51.000 --> 41:01.000
The incoming ace is the food and the outgoing bees is the waste, but the two are constantly rebuilding each other.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
Now, this is of course an extremely simple cycle.

41:06.000 --> 41:19.000
To make it more realistic, you will need a bit of more sophisticated mathematics and the mathematics here that turns out to be extremely useful is called chemical organization theory.

41:19.000 --> 41:29.000
This is because the inspirations come from chemical reactions but actually does not speak specifically about chemistry it speaks about all kind of reactions.

41:29.000 --> 41:42.000
And it is a very simple and elegant mathematical model of these kind of auto poetic system that means system that are producing themselves that are in a constant flow of self maintenance.

41:42.000 --> 41:58.000
The definition of an organization or a chemical organization is a set of components or conditions and the actions that is has two properties close that means the reactions working on the components produced new components.

41:58.000 --> 42:09.000
But after a while the new components are the same component that were already there so the system is close in the sense that it's only producing things that are already there.

42:09.000 --> 42:17.000
And it's also self maintaining that means that whatever is consumed by reaction must be produced again.

42:17.000 --> 42:23.000
So whatever disappears appears again, and nothing new is added.

42:23.000 --> 42:32.000
So, an organization is something that reproduces all its components, it keeps the process alive.

42:33.000 --> 42:41.000
Just to give you a little bit of a graphical depiction, this is a bit of a more complex organization and the one I had.

42:41.000 --> 42:46.000
The triangles here are the reactions are three.

42:46.000 --> 42:52.000
The letters here are the components that are being consumed and transformed.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
I'm not going to go into any details here.

42:55.000 --> 43:08.000
I want to give you a much more intuitive example. And this is a very nice kind of thing that you can actually buy over the weapon I'm considering buying what it's called an eco sphere.

43:08.000 --> 43:17.000
It is an aquarium that is completely closed so it's a glass sphere where nothing enters except light.

43:17.000 --> 43:23.000
No air that can escape, there is no water that goes in or goes out.

43:23.000 --> 43:30.000
And in that eco sphere there are a number of organisms that stay alive and the organism we will look at here are the shrimps.

43:30.000 --> 43:41.000
You see these little red things are shrimps, the green things are algae, and then the third one which you can't see because they are too small bacteria.

43:41.000 --> 43:49.000
And how come that these things can stay alive in a completely closed atmosphere.

43:49.000 --> 44:04.000
That is because they have reactions that are self maintaining they form an auto poetic system. This is a kind of an ecosystem at a very small scale that is producing itself and what is the production.

44:04.000 --> 44:10.000
You have an input of light because the plants need energy to go.

44:10.000 --> 44:22.000
So, then you will have the shrimps that will consume the algae and also consume the oxygen that's there.

44:22.000 --> 44:31.000
And they do that basically to survive so the shrimps don't change in the process, but they produce waste.

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
They have carbon dioxide, and they produce a little bit of heat.

44:36.000 --> 44:43.000
So if they would just be shrimps, well after a while all the algae would be eaten, all the oxygen would be taken up.

44:43.000 --> 44:49.000
There would be an accumulation of waste and CO2, the shrimps would die, the whole thing would stop.

44:49.000 --> 45:01.000
But at least for the waste, we see the bacteria will take the waste and they will also use a little bit of oxygen and they change these waste into nutrients.

45:01.000 --> 45:11.000
They also produce a little bit of carbon dioxide so if they would be just shrimps and bacteria, the system would also not be able to survive.

45:11.000 --> 45:25.000
But then we see that the algae, when they get light as an input, they can turn the CO2 and the nutrients which were produced by the bacteria into more algae.

45:25.000 --> 45:38.000
So the algae multiply themselves through this process and because there are now more algae, the shrimps can again eat the additional algae and the whole cycle starts anew.

45:38.000 --> 45:46.000
So what you see here is that the system is self-maintaining and at the same time it's a process, so it's a self-maintaining process.

45:46.000 --> 45:54.000
Everything changes, everything is being consumed, everything is being produced, but the whole survives.

45:54.000 --> 46:02.000
Now this is a commercial thing that you can buy in a shop, but you can also make one yourself and I have already done that.

46:02.000 --> 46:21.000
So what do you do? You take a big glass jar, you go to a pond, you collect all kinds of things from the pond, a little bit of dirty water, some mud, some plants, some animals typically will be snails, insects, maybe tadpoles, some worms.

46:21.000 --> 46:36.000
You put it all together and then you see what happens and well, initially it may not go very well, I'm pretty sure that some of your organisms will die because they are not adapted to this particular ecosystem.

46:36.000 --> 46:50.000
But after a while, you see that it comes to some equilibrium, that means there will be some species that will survive and it will go, so there will be fit, that means there will be adapted to this closed ecosystem.

46:50.000 --> 47:02.000
And it is a dynamical system that means things go up and down, there will be fluctuations, sometimes there will be more algae and sometimes there will be more snails.

47:02.000 --> 47:13.000
But if there are more algae and not enough snails, then the snails will have more to eat, they will eat more of the algae, so the number of algae will diminish, the number of snails will increase.

47:13.000 --> 47:21.000
If there are too many snails, there would not be enough algae left to feed all the snails, so some of the snails will die.

47:21.000 --> 47:36.000
So there will be kind of a negative feedback that whenever some species grows too much, the feedback will be that it again diminishes or vice versa, whenever one diminishes, there will be a feedback so that in the next state it will again grow.

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
So these systems tend to self-organize.

47:41.000 --> 47:49.000
Now we can use the same principle by zooming out to the very large scale, namely the scale of the whole planet.

47:49.000 --> 47:58.000
And if we look at the whole planet, the whole planet is kind of like an ecosphere, it is a closed system.

47:58.000 --> 48:08.000
The only thing that enters is light from the sun, the only thing that goes off is heat that is radiated in space, but all this is in the planet.

48:08.000 --> 48:14.000
And yeah, it has adapted the planet as a whole is stable.

48:14.000 --> 48:24.000
Of course there are fluctuations, there are occasional darts, there are sometimes species that get extinguished, there are sometimes new species that arise.

48:24.000 --> 48:29.000
But as a whole, the system is stable, is self-maintaining.

48:29.000 --> 48:45.000
And if you would write down the reactions, you will see that the reactions are actually the way I wrote them down are almost the same as the actions with the shrimps, except that now I have replaced shrimps, specifically by animals in general.

48:45.000 --> 48:58.000
I have replaced algae specifically by plants in general. I have replaced bacteria specifically by decomposes all these kinds of animals, bacteria and other decompose organic stuff.

48:58.000 --> 49:07.000
And basically the same system, it just at a much larger scale, much more complex.

49:07.000 --> 49:12.000
So what you see in there, yes?

49:38.000 --> 50:01.000
So I was wondering if we can make it a little bit more abstract, thinking that the role of what an animal is for us is not the same role that it plays there, because even ways could turn to be as animal as the animal in this view.

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
So what you see at the point?

50:06.000 --> 50:12.000
In this particular model.

50:12.000 --> 50:27.000
In this particular model, the animals are agents because animals appear both in the beginning and in the input and in the output of the reaction, while the waste is not.

50:27.000 --> 50:36.000
I'm going to show that if you would make a more detailed model at some level, waste may be an agent as well.

50:36.000 --> 50:48.000
So the agent in my definition is the one that participates in the action without being consumed by that reaction. So in this case, the animals are agents, the plants are agents.

50:48.000 --> 50:56.000
Not because the waste is just for the for the oxygen is just being consumed and produced. It does not stay.

50:56.000 --> 51:18.000
I mean, that since you were doing examples of different spatial, time spatial levels, or less the same structure is kept. So that doesn't cause my attention that then the dynamical growth in the process, being an agent for being playing the role of what we understand normally its waste,

51:18.000 --> 51:25.000
would be more like a process forward than a way of being an object.

51:25.000 --> 51:30.000
So it's going to be more abstract.

51:30.000 --> 51:43.000
Yeah, like, like, we are the ways of another process, besides being an agent we are and that relates to what you never think you were saying.

51:43.000 --> 51:59.000
It's a good question that I'm wondering whether there is a fundamental distinction, always between agents and the other side sometimes costs resources resources are things that are being transformed into other resources.

51:59.000 --> 52:10.000
While agents are the ones that perform the transformation but are not themselves affected by the transformation. Don't the other agents also will be transformed by other agents.

52:10.000 --> 52:19.000
But they, it could be that there are resources are just resources that do not do anything active. I don't know.

52:19.000 --> 52:31.000
Yeah, I have a question. So considering that like an idea can exist before the reaction and exist after the reaction. So can an idea also be an agent. Yes.

52:31.000 --> 52:38.000
And so, and so also then an archetype can be an agent.

52:38.000 --> 52:43.000
It's like a kind of governing idea for culture that persists through time.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
And that could be there.

52:47.000 --> 52:54.000
The first thing should persist during the reaction and it should be necessary for the reaction.

52:54.000 --> 53:08.000
So if certain things would only happen if the architect is there and the architect itself is not affected, then you would say that the architect is the agent of that process.

53:09.000 --> 53:17.000
Basically, yeah. So like for a religious culture like the ultimate agent, we got to be the most persistent.

53:17.000 --> 53:27.000
Except that gods have not always existed that people at some moment invented gotten at other moments have forgotten God. So, yeah.

53:27.000 --> 53:38.000
All they know agents are immortal and I D agents, I think they're very strongly culture dependent. So they come and they go.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
But yes, they are agents.

53:40.000 --> 53:48.000
But are you not making a distinction between like individual people in general, because because people show we persisted for 10,000 years.

53:48.000 --> 53:53.000
But individual human beings don't persist.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
It's that important that it's like, is there a difference between like an individual and for.

53:59.000 --> 54:12.000
Yes, in my paper, I have an agent and an agency where the agency is the more general but also distributed agents.

54:12.000 --> 54:20.000
I would imply that you have to enter some property to say that they are agents that are localized by humans.

54:20.000 --> 54:25.000
There are agencies that are distributed such as legends.

54:25.000 --> 54:33.000
On the other hand, the agency is still localized in the sense that it's on this planet.

54:33.000 --> 54:39.000
I'm not yet out of this of how to make a distinction in a short way.

54:39.000 --> 54:51.000
And why do you choose like a specialist and like goes back and over and it's like autonomy where it's something that can create itself during the time.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
It's like an overview. So why do you.

54:54.000 --> 55:03.000
No, no, the so the so the self producing things are agents agents of a more of a more sophisticated.

55:03.000 --> 55:08.000
Yeah, but why do you store agencies for something like that?

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
It's like no you're not.

55:11.000 --> 55:24.000
No, precisely because I want to get rid of the dualism which says that you have the passive object like things and then you have the active agent like things that have a mind.

55:24.000 --> 55:32.000
What I claim is that the difference between the two is much as big.

55:32.000 --> 55:37.000
Well, there's a difference, but there's a different between all the poetic.

55:37.000 --> 55:44.000
I make a different between all the poetic agents and what I might call stable or rigid agents.

55:44.000 --> 55:55.000
I think that in many cases, you may look at an agent as stable or rigid at one level of of granularity.

55:55.000 --> 56:00.000
But if then you look at it at the deeper level, you will see that actually it is a process.

56:00.000 --> 56:14.000
It's, I think even this cup, if you would look at the level of quantum fields in between the atoms of this cup, you might find that actually it's some kind of an auto poetic agent.

56:14.000 --> 56:24.000
There are models of quantum fields that say that a bolt between atoms is actually a continuous exchange of virtual photons.

56:24.000 --> 56:36.000
So maybe what these things that we consider a static agents, maybe they are really auto poetic but at the level where we would never consider them.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
Yes.

56:39.000 --> 56:48.000
I'm very new to this, so this might be a very strange question, but I tried to understand what is new and what I'm seeing.

56:48.000 --> 57:05.000
When you were setting it up, I was like, desiring and anticipating on a model which process seems to be central and the idea of entity would have disappeared.

57:05.000 --> 57:17.000
And when I see this described, I try to wrap my head around like I see actually entities that do processes with each other.

57:17.000 --> 57:23.000
So what is new and chemistry?

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have a good question.

57:26.000 --> 57:34.000
That is why it's, I mean, intuitively we see these things as entities, but that is why I started by calling them conditions.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
A condition is something that you can distinguish.

57:37.000 --> 57:43.000
And condition is something you can distinguish and distinction by the finishes for any process.

57:43.000 --> 57:55.000
So the distinction is in a sense the most basic elements, and you can distinguish something and in our nervous system basically our brain can only distinguish things that change in some way.

57:55.000 --> 57:59.000
Things that do not change, you can't really distinguish.

57:59.000 --> 58:06.000
The implicit in the notion of distinguishable is already that it appears at a certain moment, but it's not always there.

58:06.000 --> 58:17.000
The typical examples of conditions are CO2, so we tend to think of CO2 as an entity, but CO2 an entity.

58:17.000 --> 58:32.000
It's a particular state of atoms of carbon and oxygen that is sometimes formed and then again dissolved and the CO2 that's now in the atmosphere will not be the same CO2 that is tomorrow in the atmosphere.

58:32.000 --> 58:44.000
So it's a short-term and we tend to use this short-term and to re-refine and to turn them into entities, but actually there are distinctions.

58:44.000 --> 58:54.000
And then the question is which distinctions are stable and the whole process, the whole idea is if you make a network of reactions you can start to see which things are more stable, which things are less stable.

58:54.000 --> 59:03.000
Nothing is absolutely stable. All of them are changes. The basis is changed.

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
It's a concept that it's young.

59:08.000 --> 59:13.000
I have two questions.

59:13.000 --> 59:18.000
One question.

59:18.000 --> 59:26.000
The second one, I don't know if you will elaborate later on.

59:26.000 --> 59:33.000
I was thinking about luck. How can luck be defined in this relational agency?

59:33.000 --> 59:55.000
What is a lucky agent? If I was an agent in this worldview that we're defining, how does a lot of randomness and spontaneity and all this can be defined with this model?

59:55.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Yeah, that is also a good question. The way I discovered the reactions at the moment, they look deterministic, but you don't need to make the assumption that there is deterministic.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:20.000
You could, for example, have two reactions.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Two reactions, A turns into B and B turns into C.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:37.000
There are different ways to interpret that. You could say part of A turns into B, part of A turns into C, or you could say A needs to make a choice in the final turning to B or it turns into C.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:51.000
If you think statistically as A being a concentration of particles of type A, then maybe you can say 75% of the A is turning to B, 25% of the A is turning to C.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:00.000
But if A is a single particle, it cannot both turn into B and to C, sometimes it turns into B, sometimes it turns into C.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:16.000
If you're getting one in field theory, you have possible reactions, but it's intrinsically indeterministic. You can calculate probabilities generally, but there's typically more than one reaction possible.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:27.000
And statistically, then you can say 75% of A is turning to B, but an individual reaction is one.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Is there a way to talk about this using like sticking more closely to the kind of like the language process and relationships rather than talking about particles?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Because even though I know you're trying to talk about process, when we keep using these language of particles, it keeps sounding like the old language.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000
No, I know, but if I wouldn't use that language, most people probably would see the other stuff that I'm talking about.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.000
But I would be very curious to know what that language sounds like. And I think it's also partly like that our language isn't set up for...

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Yeah, no, no.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I think the best term up to now that I found is conditions.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:19.000
So A is a distinguishable condition, but the distinguishable condition is another distinguishable condition.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:28.000
So, I need to describe that very good term.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I'm angry, and then somebody tells me a joke and suddenly I get very happy.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
So A was angry, and B was happy.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
So A turned into B.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Not a particle, it's not a thing.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.000
My anger turned into happiness, but anger is not a thing, it's a state, it's a condition.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Which you can make sure that that's the point.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I think that's the same thing that is necessarily...

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:12.000
More fundamental in my ontology, which I haven't discussed at this moment because I wanted to put the end of this on a higher level agency,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
is the difference that makes a difference.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Something is distinguishable if it's a difference that makes a difference.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And making a difference means that if I have an A that doesn't react in anything that A doesn't exist,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.000
or A could make any sense, there should be at least some reaction where it turned into B

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
and some reaction that produces an A.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
If the difference doesn't make a difference, then it doesn't make this.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
So everything is only defined by its reactions.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.000
And that is, at the most fundamental level, I call it a good stuff in axiom.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000
The things get the meaning by their relations with others.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Nothing exists on its own. A on its own doesn't have any meaning.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
It only gets a meaning by participating in these reactions.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000
How is the difference from the empirical maximum of science, like if we cannot observe it, then it doesn't exist?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
It's a metaphysical view of this.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Another version is the life and its principle of the identity of the distinguishable.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:30.000
There isn't any way in which I can say that A leads to B and A5 leads to B, but I don't know.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:39.000
If I say that all A5 leads to B, and there isn't any reaction in which A and A5 have different reactions.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
When I say A5, they're the same.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
There is no difference. It makes a difference.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Therefore, A and A5 are one and the same thing.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
If they participate in exactly the same reaction, they are the same thing.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.000
And that is a problem that many people in philosophy do not understand.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:05.000
They kind of tend to assume that the example I always give is the health problem of consciousness.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
You probably have all heard about the famous zombie problem.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:16.000
So you imagine that there is a zombie and the zombie behaves exactly like a normal person, but the zombie does not have consciousness.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:25.000
For me, a zombie must be a real person, because if there is no way in which you can distinguish a zombie from a person, there is no difference.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:35.000
And then all people have consciousness, or all people are zombies, but there is no sense in postulating something that is indistinguishable.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:42.000
So things exist because they have relationships with other things, which in turn have relationships with other things.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
That is why it's good, something that is no bottom level.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I will not start from elementary particles.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
These particles exist, and everything else is reduced.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And I know I say there is this network of reactions, and whenever something appears in the network of reactions, it's there only because of the network of reactions.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
If there is a network of reactions, then it doesn't exist.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Sorry.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Being able to distinguish a zombie, we can pass through different things yet to the market.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:17.000
So how do you know that you didn't skip one kind of every end?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Yeah, that can happen, and that's how we learn.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
You can't conclude that some of them are the same then.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:35.000
No, no, the thought experiment of Thomas about the zombies is that he says explicitly that is not where you can explain it.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:43.000
If you state that as an assumption, then you create a meaningless thought experiment.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
But I wonder if I have some kind of intuition.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Even by replacing things by relationships, it's like going back to this, trying to start from this idea of elementary relationships.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's really like a solution to kind of productionism or not.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Maybe it's just productionism by another name.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:18.000
It's like, it's still this idea that you can come back to something elementary, some basic building block that you can then put together to explain the world.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
There's another aspect about this form of this.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:45.000
It can be anything as big or small as small, it can be being angry, it can be being happy, it can be the world having a COVID epidemic versus the COVID epidemic being finished.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Nothing says how big or how small this case is. The only thing is this is the distinguishable condition that leads to a different distinguishable condition.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:06.000
So it's elementary in notation, it's not elementary in the sense of what it represents, it does not claim that what it represents is something elementary.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I can use this formula to speak about COVID and COVID is something extremely complicated.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:27.000
But, and couldn't it be that a way to express the relational agency model is to express that objects and subjects can switch position?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Because if you can show that sometimes an animal is eaten, sometimes he gets eaten, so sometimes he's a subject, sometimes the object.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:46.000
This kind of illustrates the relational agency idea more than just summing up reactions, you know what I mean?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:09:04.000
You certainly have the two types of reactions, you have the reaction, human was called as human, the human eats the cow, was wasted.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:17.000
The cow is being eaten, and then you have the cow was lost, the cow was wasted, and the cow is the agent.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:25.000
So they are interested in the cow becoming a subject and human object in the same reaction.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:40.000
There's an example of when you try to transfer potatoes in the garden, you think you're the subject and the potato is the object because you choose the potato, but actually you can say that the potato breed chose you because he seduced you to choose him.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
So he actually is also the subject and you're the object listening to the potato. You see what I mean?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
There's no problem, no problem.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000
There's two types after that.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:03.000
There are two humans.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
There are both, both of them are agents.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I always suggest that we move with the discussion to later part maybe the anthology gets more clear.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I don't have that many more slides but there are a few slides that I would like to show which to some degree speak about these things.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I think that important concept here is that you can have transitions in levels of complexity.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Whenever you have agents, they interact, they tend to adapt to each other until they become mutually adapted.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:58.000
That means they form a network of synergistic relationships, mutually dependent, and that network when it becomes self-maintaining, it can develop sufficient autonomy so that we will look at it as an agent.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:11.000
An agent itself means that it will transform certain things into other things without being affected by the transformation, not affected in the sense that it loses its autonomy.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:23.000
A super agent in this form is easy to express as a sub-network of agents.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I'm going to make drawings here to make it quickly get complicated.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
That's an old idea of system theory.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:48.000
System theory says you can zoom in and supply your system into a network of subsystems or you can zoom out and look at your system as just one part of a super system.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
You can do this perfectly with this formalism.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:00.000
At a certain moment you see a certain organization of needs, a self-maintaining network of relationships.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
You draw a boundary around it and you say that's a system.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:16.000
That system might interpret as a super agent and now I can look at the relation between that super agent and other super agents and then I can put them together in an even bigger level and like that I can build.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Some of the examples, these are what we used to call metasystem transitions in the Wikipedia cybernetica project.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:33.000
The origin of life starting from the reaction between molecules is what we are now working on in our double-comp projects trying to simulate that.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Symbiogenesis is also a classic example where you have organisms of different types that start living together and form one bigger organism.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:51.000
You can see in multicellularity cells that live together and start differentiating, performing different roles.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:06.000
So each cell is an agent but all the cells together, the multicellular organ also form an agent and of course the emergence of social systems organizations from individuals.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.000
A little more example, the cell can be also understood as an orthopedic agent.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:23.000
A cell is something actually that looks very much like this ecosphere, this glass ball that I showed that has an input of light.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
What are the agents inside the cell?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Well actually the genes, the genes are the ones that produce the enzymes and the enzymes are the catalysts of the reactions.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:44.000
So in a sense you could say the genes are the agents inside the cell but it's not like in the old idea that the genes control the cell.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:58.000
No, the genes are individual agents that form a society and the different genes need to mutually agree and coordinate their actions and that's together with the input and output of the cell.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
The cell is constantly adapting to its environment.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:09.000
So genes, inputs and outputs all together form this one super agent that is this very complex symbiotic network.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And what would be the process description of that?

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Instead of the genes as entities?

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Well the genes are catalysts which specifically for genes are very stable because the cell wants to store its information in genes so the genes are highly protected between DNA which is difficult to change.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Yeah, when you multiply a cell you need to multiply DNA, when you have a sexual recombination you do need to change your DNA so every agent however stable it is within a certain context there will be context in which an agent is formed or distorted.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I was thinking more, I hope you will say that the processes start about because in the process ontology, I mean radical process ontology, we will expect that the originary process is not for agents.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:18.000
It's an originary pathway for processes involved.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:28.000
So agents are processes involved and they are embodied and observed through the distinctions we make and this we call the agents but what it works for really is the process.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:35.000
The agents are a kind of local concentrations of processes.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:41.000
So you might say an agent is kind of like a concentrated bunch of processes.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:54.000
That's why I define an agent as a bunch of processes. An agent is really a collection of reactions of processes. An agent is an embodiment of reactions.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:06.000
So from what you said, an agent is simply that which persists through the process. It's this idea of the catalyst.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:15.000
It's the pattern which remains in a sense. All these processes are happening and there's one pattern, there's one thing that's stable the catalyst which kind of goes through.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:24.000
It's the thing which in the end undergoes no difference through the process. Everything else undergoes change and difference and this agent remains the same.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Locally during certain processes, not during other processes.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:38.000
So why, I think my question is also like why in trying to construct a kind of in some sense like a process ontology or a relational ontology.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
The relation is another way of a difference, right?

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Which I think, I think all of us have basically agreed that it's super important idea, right?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:58.000
But why in constructing a process ontology would you then again put in the central piece the thing which doesn't undergo change?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:08.000
If the whole point of the ontology is the difference is the most important thing, why could, as the central point, exactly the thing which undergoes no difference?

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000
For two reasons.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:18.000
The first is to connect with our standard traditional intuitive ontology which sees objects and agents.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:28.000
The second, because evolution has this principle of natural selection, which means that those that are stable survived.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Evolution has a tendency to produce things that are more stable.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:41.000
If that wasn't the case, then all this would be one big chaos, like let's say immediately after the big bang.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Immediately after the big bang, there wasn't agents, there wasn't stability.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:52.000
There was just one sea of particles reacting with other particles turning into other particles.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Happily we're no longer in that state.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:02.000
We are in a state where things have coalesced and stabilized, but the stability is always a stability.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
But without that stability, we wouldn't be here.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
We wouldn't be able to sit on this bench.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
We wouldn't be able to talk.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
We need to explain why the stability there is...

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
I mean, ontologically there are two big problems.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
If you start from an ontology of objects, the problem is to explain change.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
And in my view, you can't.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:30.000
If you start from invariant things or the fundamental building blocks of the world, you cannot explain change.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Because if these building blocks are always there, why should they start changing?

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
What causes them to change?

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000
If you start from versus ontology, then your problem is to explain stability.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
We all agree that in the world there is both stability and change.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000
So if you start from the one, you need to explain the other.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000
And it's much easier to explain stability from change than the vice versa.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
You can't explain change from stability.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
You can explain stability from change.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000
But stability remains relative. It's not absolute.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:13.000
The concept of time and the special place in your ontology is probably the idea of what is the essence of the process.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
It rests on the concept of time.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
So it seems like the whole ontology builds on this concept.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:31.000
I think time, people tend to give time more from the month over the year because I have been working on mathematical models

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
for the emergence of space-time out of processes.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
So for me, a process is something more fundamental than time.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Time assumes that there is someone somewhere, someone with a block,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000
and that all these blocks are synchronized and then where the process happens.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:57.000
So A is turned into, there is someone,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
what happens at time D2?

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
And that happens at time D1.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:09.000
This is already a very complex construction.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:16.000
At the level of this underneath, it turns into,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
where is the problem?

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Where is the time?

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Time emerges if you have loads of these things.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.000
And then you can see that there are something like the space-time concept is in there.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:36.000
And then you can start to look at time, maybe as some way of describing this thing.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
But we know from the relativity theory that time also is relative.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Time for this part is the same as the time for that process.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:48.000
So the idea of time as an absolute thing,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
time and space,

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.000
time and space, that's a Newtonian framework.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
All processes happen in space and time.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
No, processes happen.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000
And then we look at the arrangement to say,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:11.000
well, we can organize and bundle by putting the space-time code in its own one.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.000
But space and time are the same.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Quantum mechanics is another example where you see that space doesn't actually play any role,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
because things can be entangled.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
It's millions of light years apart.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000
And then how do you define change?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
The change is primitive.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
So you don't define change.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Change is your primitive.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
That's an autology.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Each autology needs to have a rudimentary, primitive element that is not defined.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
So the process is the fundamental element.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Everything else is built out of the process.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Even space and time.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
And I must admit that the parts that still first stage we mostly,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
the first thing I did in my PhDs in physics,

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000
is make a process of space-time out of processes.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000
It worked, except that I needed to make one assumption,

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
which I'm not happy with.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
And I still haven't found an alternative for that one assumption.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Maybe the assumption is that processes don't go back in time,

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
because if they go back in time,

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
then you lose the whole idea of time order.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Why don't you like it?

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Open possibility.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
No?

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Like, these reactions have certain properties, no?

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Because like, just put, if you have like,

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
opening we have like one reaction happening in the process,

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
and the other reaction will be less difficult.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Because we're not moving in time.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000
We only need to suppose and save kind of the same which one going in the process.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
No, if you go to the lowest level we found.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:03.000
The kind of formalism that we use at the kinetic and the dynamic level,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.000
they kind of assume that there is a speed of reaction.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000
At the ontological level, I don't want to assume that.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Let's say there is a difference between the ontology and the formalism.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
In the formalism, you may want to add some parameters

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:26.000
and make it easier to model that are not necessarily fundamental in the ontology.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I don't yet know whether these processes should have some quantitative speed parameter in there.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000
That's one way to do it. It's an easy way to do it.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:45.000
But I don't like it because it makes an additional assumption

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
which I don't think I will justify.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I think that there is something adding to what you were asking.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Even though we might not have a measurable or scalar version of time,

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I think it will be reasonable to assume that if we have a meta-system transition,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000
so we get one level, then we get the emergent level.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And then out of this, in this emergent level, there is a new emergent level,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000
like from cells to tissues to tissues to organisms.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
We have three levels there, for example.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000
We might expect that the processes that make up the voyette in the organism

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
take more time than the processes that make up the voyette in the cell.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:37.000
So still, even if we might not have a time scale, we still have an ordering of time,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000
like an organ. This takes more time than that.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I think we at least can kind of make it orderly and critical.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000
And the second thing that maybe has to be following the same point

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.000
is that every time you make a model representation with a reaction network,

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:06.000
you have to make, implicitly, a choice on the level of this time order time scale

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
you're making for the distinctions you want to work with.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000
So now when you say, okay, this A is the COVID model,

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
this is the COVID pandemic in a certain city,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
and this other B is no pandemic in the city,

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.000
then you are implicitly assuming a time scale where this reaction,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I mean, in the regular physical authority, you're implicitly assuming a time scale

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
and a way of making distinctions in time space.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
But perfectly, you could change this model into a fine-grainer model

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000
where A now is an auto-biotic system of multiple things that embody

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:46.000
like our maybe more mesoscale human daily life view of a pandemic.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
And then the transition, instead of being seen as A goes to B,

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000
it might be like a very long process in this other view

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000
and even seen as a meta-system transition,

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:02.000
that in this other level, you look at it as a fundamental reaction to say,

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
so maybe this choice of basic level of representation

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000
and timescales induced by that, which is actually the scientific connection,

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
because you make distinctions somehow,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:20.000
and you have to measure them for the sake of doing a represent scientific

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
driven at this representation of reality.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.000
So this part maybe wasn't that explicit in the talk,

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:39.000
because it's very kind of not easy to imagine that A is actually a complex,

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000
that is auto-biotic somehow, it's defining its own time scale.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
So, yeah.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
But it's exactly that confusion that's why I...

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
And then you go back then.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000
I would love to hear it expressed in another language,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000
whereas really we stick to this language of process,

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.000
because the goal, after all, is to try to make this unification somehow,

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000
to try to bring all these different ideas together in this new ontology

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
that can be usable.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000
And it's hard to use because it slips into this other kind of thinking,

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
it slips into thinking that these processes are things.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
But also, I think what gets lost is a little bit this...

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Well, I feel as if it's lost is also this coming back to this animism.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:35.000
I think that was also such an intriguing part of the talk,

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
of the word of ideas.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
And I don't feel like this is how our kind of...

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.000
My instinct is that I don't feel like this is how our hunter-gatherer nature,

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:52.000
of worshipping cousins and four parents thought of this.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I think that there's something more about story that's being lost.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
I think that the idea of story could be really important,

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
because a story is, after all, the most persistent thing in this.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I suspect, I would like to experiment it.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I think this, in general, has been experimenting with it,

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
that you put up with stories as reactions like that.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I mean, I made this human simulation piece,

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
a long time ago, which was played based on reaction networks.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000
But it's also the other thing to think about.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
If it's about thinking about what's the most persistent agent in all this,

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
well, the most persistent agent is also story,

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
because this is all stories.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
This is all different ways of telling a story about ontology,

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
about how the world works, and so on and so forth.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
In a sense, story itself is the most persistent agent,

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
but it's also a process, right?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
It's persistent, but it's also a process.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
And I think if you're a hunter-gatherer going through the forest,

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
that's how you perceive things.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
You perceive yourself as a story in relationship to other stories,

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
and there's also an emotional relationship.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
The condition of both of our stories is that the story is sequential,

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
because the language is sequential,

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000
we can only speak about what's happening at the time,

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
or what this just explains,

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
and this is something that happened in parallel.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
And if you want something like an altruistic procedure,

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
you see that lots of things are happening in parallel,

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
and that's what the story cannot catch.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
No, but I think with the mythology, it's different.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000
With the mythology, you have multiple stories in parallel,

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
and you understand intuitively where you're at,

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
and you give the mythology a story.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Yeah, but that's not enough to explain something

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
like how the metabolism of a soul works.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I don't think any mythological story will capture all that complexity.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000
I don't think even our brain can capture it.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
I think you will really need a computer model to capture that.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
But these are stories, though, anyway.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
I would like to come back to this complaint,

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:55.000
which I see the same way.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.000
We are looking at a bunch of objects,

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
and how this effect is produced,

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
because you say you would like to hear this language,

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:12.000
and I wonder if language is ever able to give you the sound you want to hear,

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
because whatever we will be doing,

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000
we are using language which has nouns,

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.000
which are the basic protocol that we are using,

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
and then it's translated into this.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Okay, let's drop nouns, let's pick verbs, and adjectives.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Let's do that. You will hear processes.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:40.000
But as long as he can put A is chaos,

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.000
B is changeability of feelings,

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
and C is wind,

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000
and you will say, but why are you speaking about those objects?

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Because they are named and put there,

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
and they are interacting and so on.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
So I think this is one contributing factor,

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
which is the major one,

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
that we will not get out of objects if we don't change the language

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
by which we are referring to,

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000
which is an underlying method for modeling,

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
the natural language.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
And another contributing factor,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
which has to do with this particular formula,

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.000
is that when you say process ontology,

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.000
or relational agency,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000
to me, not necessarily some thing changing into something,

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
is the basic relationship.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Forget the things, changing into, yes?

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000
So of course, I know it's a kernel of your model, yes?

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
But I think relationship,

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.000
relation, process, doesn't have to be this changing into,

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.000
and a lot of agencies of relationships

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.000
are not this changing thing,

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
but exactly persisting of a relationship,

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
which is the agency.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.000
A consistent relationship for me is a repeated process,

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
a self-maintaining process.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
I am done with you,

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
that assumes that from time to time we talk to each other,

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
we exchange information, we help each other,

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:19.000
there is a self-maintaining dual person between you and me.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Fine, but you could think, yes,

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:29.000
that the process or the agency of a relationship,

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
you could approach in modeling,

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000
not by arrows, but let's say lines or whatever,

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.000
that the existence of this friendship is the agent in your life,

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
in my life, in community, and so on.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:48.000
And it's more like an almost like a gravitational field

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
that acts, yes?

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000
And then it would be a different model, I know.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
It's the same model.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
It's the same model.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
It's to change the reactions to be suspicious,

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
and suspicious to be reactions.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000
It's actually in the block, it's the same,

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
but you change the, who is who,

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
but it's actually the same model.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000
You mean you can, what I say, you can model with this,

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
this I know, yes?

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
I think one of the problems.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Understanding of the relationship as a basic unit.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
I think one of the problems with the formalism,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000
it's so simple, and the examples are so intuitive,

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
that people immediately assume that,

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
yeah, but it's too simple.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000
They don't see how flexible it is.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.000
It is flexible, like A, B, C, and like it's maximum flexibility,

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
because anything can be, like it's a maximum.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Except, yeah, I'm now speaking about this,

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000
like the ontology of the turning into, yes,

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
that there could be like an ontology of,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
yeah, just different types of relationships,

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000
depending on the situation.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000
It's like, when you define agents,

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.000
why not defining, like getting rid of agents,

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
and defining it as shared agent disease?

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Because at the beginning you said,

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
everything is about relationships,

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000
and this ontology is based on relationships.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
So if we have, for example,

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000
someone who has that formula, human plus cow,

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000
human takes something else on that person's mind.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
So, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000
So, probably, I'm thinking of how much of a human is a cow,

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000
and how much of a cow is inside a human already,

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
as a potentiality.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
So, could it be, I suggest,

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000
defining as some form of every person,

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000
and every entity or thing is a shared agency already?

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
It's kind of like a precondition, defining as everything.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
What do you define as a shared agency?

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Meaning that you are, by nature,

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000
you are of a relationship nature,

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
rather than that agent.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Because when you say an agent,

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
an agent has a boundary,

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
and has its own internal dynamics,

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
based on complex adaptive systems.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Yeah, but it also has the relationship.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
The whole thing is a network.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
The whole thing is a network.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
There are no independent things in there.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
There are no things that are not that work.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000
I mean, if I were to do it...

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000
If now I would do one here,

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
that's not possible.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Everything needs to be part of the one network.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000
There are no pages that do not interact with other entities.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Because if they don't interact, they won't interact.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
They don't exist.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000
You could call it like that, a field of agencies, yes?

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Actually, the field metaphor is quite nice,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
because fields are typically seen as these kind of arrows,

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000
but they are like the point in all kind of directions.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
And what the field does is it creates a flow,

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
it makes things move.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
That's another way.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I mean, there are different metaphors to try to explain this.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:22.000
What I have been emphasizing here is agency and relationality.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
The basis is process.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Why do I define agency?

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Because of these new approaches.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I spoke about multi-agent systems

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
and actual network theory,

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
where people are more and more starting to think in terms of agencies.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
And why relational?

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Because the agents do not exist on the whole point of the agency.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Everything is one big network of interactions,

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000
in which locally you can distinguish agencies,

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000
but they are only locally autonomous and stable.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
They are still part of this larger whole,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
and this larger whole will change them.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
But you need local stability,

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
because otherwise you have a world that is like,

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
as I said just after the big bang,

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
a world that is pure, chaos, pure change.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000
You need to explain why this table is stable,

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
and why this thing is stable,

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
and why I'm less stable than the table,

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000
but still I will still be there when you talk to me tomorrow.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
You need to explain that.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000
So you need to explain why in this chaos,

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
this field of actions and interactions,

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
there are islands of stability, which are relative.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I mean, they are like floating islands.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
They don't stay in the same place,

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
but there are kind of islands where you know

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
if you go on the island, you won't sink to the floor.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
There's stability there.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000
What if you didn't need to explain it?

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I'm being a little provocative,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
but what if you just...

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
But you don't need to explain why the table is stable.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000
It's a version of the plan.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
It seems to be getting in the way.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
I don't really care about it.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
You don't really care about it.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
We're talking to some other people

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
who still believe in internal mechanics,

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000
and somehow we want to convince them of our way of thinking.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
But what if we just left them to their own devices for a while

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
and just go on with thinking about the process

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
without trying to convince them

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
that the table exists?

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000
No, as a mystic or as an artist,

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
you might take that attitude,

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
but as somebody who wants to change the world,

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
who wants to be pragmatic, who wants to develop technologies,

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
who wants to do science,

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
you need to look at stable things.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
You need to make sure that the vaccine you have developed

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
against COVID will still work

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
in five hours from now.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.000
If it's just the process and the vaccine changes every minute,

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
then you cancel COVID.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I think stability is not about not changing,

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000
but about not having an effect on something.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000
And when you look at the table, it's not stable always,

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000
because if you fall over a table, it has had an effect on you,

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
so it's not always a stable thing.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000
So it depends how you define stability.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000
If something has even an object as an effect on you,

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000
it has agency because it changes your life.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000
So some of these agents are static.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
There are theories that say,

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.000
like Vibrant matter that all objects have agency as well,

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.000
because they can have an effect on other objects or agents.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
You see what I mean?

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
I'm wondering about the more pragmatic goal, let's say,

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
with regard to what science does,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000
how science does things.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000
And I'm thinking about what is the

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000
epistemic value of this ontology

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.000
opposed to the Italian classical ontology.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Because at the end of the day, the collection data

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000
and the ontology we have, the metadata we have there,

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:03.000
basically, you could call it like stable processes

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
or a stable condition,

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
but at the end of the day,

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
it goes back to the same way of viewing the world,

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000
which is just some entities we call it process.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.000
I mean, it's just like things like the change of terminology,

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
but at the end of the day, we're doing the same thing.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.000
We're going to go back to doing the same thing.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000
No, can I compliment you a little bit?

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Because it's very much related to your question,

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
and you can answer both at the same time.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Which is how, where would you position this?

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Because it's philosophical standpoint,

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000
but also it's kind of linking to science.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000
So where would you put it in the philosophy of science,

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000
let's say, traditional groups?

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I'm not sure I want to put it in the philosophy of science,

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
but what I want to say is, as I said it here,

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000
it's an extension of the Newtonian world,

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000
which means it does not say Newton was wrong,

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
objects don't exist.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000
It says, in some cases, it is useful to think

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000
in terms of objects following the laws of motion of Newton,

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.000
but if you want to go deeper and especially if you want to look at processes

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000
like I say here, life, mind, society, culture,

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000
then the thinking in terms of objects is not useful.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000
It's like in classical scientific revolutions

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.000
like relativity theory of quantum mechanics,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.000
relativity theory did not negate Newtonian mechanics.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:41.000
It says Newtonian mechanics is a limit case for low speeds of life,

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:46.000
or quantum mechanics will not say Newtonian mechanics is incorrect.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Newtonian mechanics is, let's say, Newtonian mechanics

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000
is an approximation for macroscopic objects.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:59.000
So in that sense, Newtonian mechanics and all the existing theories of science

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.000
are not negated by this, but they are seen as a limit case

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:10.000
for more specific situations where the processes are very simple

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000
and you don't have to take into account all these complex

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000
anthropometric self-maintaining interactions.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000
So what this does is expand the field of things you can describe

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000
to things like life, mind, consciousness, etc.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.000
But without giving up the old stuff which we know works,

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.000
it's just that we don't take it as literally anymore.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000
We're not going to say that atoms are like billion balls, we know that,

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:43.000
but still sometimes it can be useful to think of an atom like a billion ball.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.000
You mentioned the measurement of a model,

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
to make it really concrete.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
I'd be interested in seeing a very simple application.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.000
You mentioned I want to do research on humans around societies

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000
and I'm going to do that using mathematical models.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000
So in what way will I do it different than I did before

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
because of this ontology?

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Well, we have a number of mathematical models like that.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Two people in the audience are doing that.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:17.000
In the online models, the last two are starting today.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000
But I would like to compliment on your answer,

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.000
because the title I think is extremely clear on that,

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:30.000
but maybe since it's the title, it's also kind of overseen.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Is the ontology for transdisciplinary?

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Do you call it transdisciplinary in science?

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Yeah, so the point is that in traditional science,

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:48.000
the act of identifying the objects is kind of immediate.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
You want to study in ecology.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
What do you have? Species, resources?

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.000
It's kind of like the ontology that we can equip with

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
from natural language is already given us.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.000
The entities we want to observe and it's all kind of,

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
culturally, you know, constructed.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000
It's easy to say,

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
ah, we're going to study these things that already have a language on.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000
When it comes to transdisciplinary research,

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
the problem of identifying the objects,

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000
it's already like, what are your guys?

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
What are the guys that we will be studying with?

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
That's already a problem.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.000
And that's why the traditional approaches in V6 and so on,

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
might, for sure.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Because you don't want to study the entities themselves.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000
You want to study the meta-guys that seem to be more representative

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:37.000
of the phenomenon than the entities that are composing this phenomenon.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Like in COVID, me being sick, neighbor of someone not sick,

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.000
it's like, it's not the phenomenon of COVID.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
But that's how in agent-based models,

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
and you saw, like, all the data that you were doing in the pandemic

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000
was focusing on the basic entities doing models

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
and seeing how this thing works.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
But another perspective is to look at the whole of the situation,

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.000
of course, composed by parts,

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.000
but looking at the potential states of this global situation.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.000
And there is something called the top-down interactions,

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
that maybe Francis, you can explain better than me,

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
which is also interesting,

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.000
but because when you don't know what this big guy,

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
this major transition guys are,

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
and then you identify them, you can see that this meta-system

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:25.000
is also making the influences of the individuals.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
And that's, like, in social science, it's very common.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Maybe you mark an example.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
So, top-down.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:38.000
How is it different than just a very complex system?

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
So using, like, if you look at standard psychological research,

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000
they use also observable objects,

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
like intelligence and personality.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
And then you could just build the top of those

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
becomes very complex stuff,

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.000
which I get in society with multiple people

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000
and directing in very complex ways also with objects.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Yeah, the point is that this provides, I mean, in my view,

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Francis, you can say, no, she's wrong,

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.000
but in my view, this provides a conceptual framework

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.000
to start understanding the levels of representation.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
And it's not just from scratch,

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.000
and then I look at statistical macro properties

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
and then I say, this is happening.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Because this is the typical complex systems thinking

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.000
that the guys approach any big question from the model.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000
And there is no conceptual framework to think about

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
the different levels that start appearing

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000
and the meta-level interactions that can happen.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000
So if you start from this perspective,

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.000
you have like a set of principles that you want to look at

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
before saying, ah, this is the phenomenon.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000
You want to build the story of the complex system

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
level by level, let's say.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000
And I think this is an important game,

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000
and particularly we have been doing models

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
or trying to conceptualize better notions

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.000
that are typically intermediate like sustainability

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000
or resilience or concepts or notions of that kind,

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:12.000
that kind of when you look from the very bottom part of the system,

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000
you kind of fall short of explaining,

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.000
but if you look at these different layers.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
I would like to add something.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.000
I made my PhD in physics of the structure of physical models,

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
and I came to the conclusion that my analysis

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
in Newton and Feynman, that there are always a number

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
of ontological elements that are kind of assumed.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
You first assume that there are your objects.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.000
In your case, might be people or organizations.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
These objects have properties.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.000
These properties can take on different values.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
These different values define states.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000
These different states define a state space.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000
And then you assume some kind of a dynamics

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.000
of how the properties change over time

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
under the influence of different forces.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000
And like that, you build layer on top of layer,

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.000
and then you get typically a very complicated model.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000
But actually all your ontological assumptions

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
are already fixed in the model.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.000
So afterwards, you can maybe fine tune a little bit

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
by changing this parameter or that.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000
You can no longer change the model while you're working on it.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Or with this kind of modeling, I just add a few reactions.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
And the whole model changes.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
But not in a way that you lose what you had.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
You can put it in your simulation,

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000
and you see that if I add two or three reactions,

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
or I move two or three reactions,

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
well, the dynamics changes.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
But you don't have to throw away everything.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
You don't have to start from scratch.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Then that's what makes it so easy.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.000
You add a few things.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
You take away a few things.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
And each time you have a working model,

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
and some of those will be better,

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
some of those will be worse,

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
you don't need to start from scratch.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:08.000
With this micro-macro level of reactions to the emergence,

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000
we also defined a process

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.000
because it seemed to be happening in parallel

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
between the two.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:22.000
So, for example,

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:28.000
the relationship between the two

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
to one is intermingled on the other.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.000
So, is this also a process?

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I don't like the subject of super-medium.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I speak by the shape of emotions

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
to what I love at home,

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000
because properties that don't are not properties of the form.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
And how do you get growth?

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Because it's here,

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
if I have more or less growth,

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000
I'll make a lot.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000
I don't think there's a hope,

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
but of course, there are still things

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000
that you can't go out,

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.000
because nothing is isolated.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.000
And now I can look at this as a whole,

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
and this as a whole will have properties,

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
because what comes in here

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000
undergoes all kinds of nonlinear interactions,

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000
whatever comes out here.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
It's not what went in here.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.000
It's not one of the things in there.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
It's the whole self-maintaining thing

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
that has produced this output.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000
And yeah, so I say this thing as a whole

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000
reacts in a different way than any of it from God.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000
It has emergent properties.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
But in this case,

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000
I can say how I'll see things like this.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.000
I don't need to know all these details inside

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
to simplify my model

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
or just to get what comes in and what goes out.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000
In other cases,

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
I might want to look inside

01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.000
and look at all these things

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.000
and then notice that actually

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:05.000
there are still small ones in there.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
And then I can make my model as detailed

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.000
or as close as I want.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
That's what you want of models.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
There are always simplifications,

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
but the question is to leave out the things

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
that you find less important

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
and to get in the things that are most important.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
And then by experimenting with this language,

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.000
I think it's much easier to make good models.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Yeah.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.000
how the mind fits into the smaller part

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000
of this model,

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:42.000
particularly with respect to the mind.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Actually, the mind is,

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.000
you might say, the most obvious application

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
of which I started by saying

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.000
that the character is a matter

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
that follows these deterministic rules,

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000
these deterministic rules,

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
and that is the mind

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
that can think of its own free,

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
that has free will and accessionality.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.000
What I say is agency is something

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
that's in between the passive object

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000
and the free will in mind.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000
And depending on how much agency there is,

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
it will have more of these properties

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.000
that we associate with mind, intelligence, emotions,

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000
memories, values, goals,

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
and agency as I have developed it

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
in a couple of other papers.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
And what we are doing now in our project is,

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
as this network,

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
this anthropogenic network becomes

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
what we call more resilient,

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
which means more adaptive,

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000
more able to deal with more difference outside situations,

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000
it becomes smarter,

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
it becomes more autonomous,

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.000
it becomes less dependent on the external conditions.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
And at a certain moment,

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
people say it has a mind,

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.000
and for me, there is no such thing as mind or no mind.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
It's a continuum.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000
I call it agency,

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
and there is low levels of agency.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
The particle has a very low level of agency,

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
and my brain has a very high level of agency,

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.000
and in between you have bacteria,

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
and trees, and rocks,

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
and they all have agency,

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.000
which means they all have some degree of mind.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.000
That's also implied in some of your consciousness,

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
or what is consciousness?

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Consciousness, I interpret as sensation.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
This thing is sensitive,

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:26.000
because if there is an impulse, it changes.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:34.000
So, the example I gave with the a and the b,

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
a produces b,

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.000
b produces a,

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:43.000
not suppose that there is also a reaction,

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000
a plus c is d,

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.000
the moment I bring d into the system,

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:53.000
d plus c into the system,

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:56.000
c plus a will produce b,

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000
which means there will be less a available.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
The system feels,

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000
it senses that something is not the way it should be.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
What is the way it should be?

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Self-maintenance.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Natural selection leads to systems that are self-maintaining.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
The moment something happens

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
that affects the self-maintenance,

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
they sense it, they feel it,

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
and they will react to it.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
That's the other point,

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.000
you become sensitive to the perturbations,

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000
and then you act to compensate the perturbations.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
The self is consciousness.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
It's a consciousness,

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
but at a very, very limited level.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
At a very primitive level,

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.000
just the bacterium is conscious of the fact

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000
that it is moving in an environment where there is toxins,

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
because it has certain rules that says that

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
if toxins concentration increase,

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
then it should move,

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
change direction,

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
and move in a different direction.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000
The bacterium is sensitive to toxins.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:58.000
It feels that there are toxins,

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
and it performs the action

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
to move away from these toxins.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
So it's a kind of a consciousness

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
if you want to pull it like that.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Some people call this panpsychism,

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
that even environmental biologists

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
have this sensation.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
If you want to pull it like that,

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
I don't object,

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
but I just wouldn't use the term

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
to call it unmindedly.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000
It's a question of more of a taste

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.000
in terminology than in a conceptual difference.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
For me, mind is a continuum

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000
from a lot of particles to the human brain,

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
and...

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
I don't know if you have seen

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
the magic work of David

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
from this notion of intelligence,

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
and it's very similar to what you...

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Have you seen that?

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Because you kind of have gotten...

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I have had a couple of papers of Levin,

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
and he has a very similar...

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
I was with you for an article on that.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Michael Levin has a very similar...

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
It's Levin,

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
he speaks of this...

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
well, like,

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
similar kind of relativity,

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
we rely on it,

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
the whole of intelligence.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
It's like this planet we can reach

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
with no consciousness

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
in the process, like sense,

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
and then he says,

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
okay, where is David now, humans,

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
and then a group of humans

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
has a higher goal,

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
so a higher intelligence,

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
and then he controls

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
things and planets and stuff.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
So he goes all the way up to...

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Yeah, I think his model

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
is simple and mind,

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
a little bit too simplistic,

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
he kind of imagined that

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
if this is me,

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
and this is space,

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
and this is time,

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
then I'm aware of a certain region

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
in space-time.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
That's my memory of what has happened.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
This is my idea

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
of what's going on in other places

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
in the universe,

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
and this is my anticipation of what might happen.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
And then he says, for a human,

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
it will be big,

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
but for a dog, it will be small,

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
and for a bacteria,

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
it will be tiny.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
So he says it's the wider the range,

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
it's the higher your consciousness

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
or your agency.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
It's one way

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
to do it.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Time is up.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Thank you very much.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Close here.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Are there any questions from the group?

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Yeah, we didn't even ask

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
because there were so many questions

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
in the room, and now it's time

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
it's up, so we want to extend it

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
for a bit.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
For me, can we extend it a bit?

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Yeah, so

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
if there are any questions

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
from the audience online,

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
because soon we will be moving

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
to a more informal part

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
of the meeting

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
and leaving this room, so

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
I think we can take

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
one or two questions from

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
from the online audience

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
if there's any

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
questions there.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Guys?

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Look.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Here it is.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Here it is.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Anyone?

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Anyone?

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
I have perhaps

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
a small comment

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
only.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Is it clear?

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Can everybody hear me?

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
No, just to comment a little bit

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
first of all, very interesting

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
talk. Francis, I enjoyed a lot

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
and

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
I would like to comment a little bit

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
on the observation that Orion

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
and Marta were making also.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Why starting

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
from

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
this kind of ontology?

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
It could

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
be that we will have

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
some more surprises, of course

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
if science develops more

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
and there could be some hints

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
already

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
and the comment I want to make

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
is a little story

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
that Feynman once

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
said

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
in the beginning of the quantum

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
computer idea

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
there was then a whole theory

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
in computer science

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
the Turing machine

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
a kind of a fundamental theory

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
the Turing machine would be the

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
fundamental entity of

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
computation

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
and still many many computer

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
scientists work with this as a

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
fundamental entity of

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
computation and then the quantum

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
computer came

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
and Feynman once said

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
the problem with Turing is that

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
he didn't know what paper was

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
what a strip of paper was you see

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
and so

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
the Turing machine

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
you need a strip of paper

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
for the material world

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
and so quantum computer

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
doesn't

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
work with strips of paper

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
things are not on paper anymore

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
and I think we will stumble

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
at a certain moment and that might

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
when I hear

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Orion say why not

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
start with stories

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
of course you can see as a scientist

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
very difficult to have a grasp on a story

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
but we might

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
stumble on the foundations

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
I think where even

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
writing on a blackboard

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
or what we can do mathematically

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
will be too limited

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
to really go deep into

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
reality because if you write

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
on a blackboard a, b, c

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
it's of course

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
something specific you do

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
a gives

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
b, b gives c

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
you cannot

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
do what eventually a quantum computer

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
could do you know on a blackboard

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
so

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
just my comment

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
would be that

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
in an amazing way

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
we might

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
be repeating parochial things

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
in some way like the old

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
reductionist

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
like the old reductionist

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
in the time of

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
and not be completely aware of it

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
that is a little bit what could

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
be

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
the future of

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
and then of course we will have to change again

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
we will have to adapt

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
to new findings and stuff like that

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
and I think that is a little bit

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
what sometimes is felt also

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
yeah processes but

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
processes okay you can

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
you can make it say

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
it's perhaps not in time

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
but there is something also

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
that limits our self

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
being on a blackboard to imagine

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
with our material mind

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
what can happen

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
so even there I think

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
there are some limitations

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
if you really go to the depth

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
of what an ontology is

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
I don't know

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
I don't know what the limitations are

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
there are some hints here and there

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
I think

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
so

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
does it mean that

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
every

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
every century

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
or every generation

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
every kind of dancing

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
around the sun in reality

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
we remake the reductionism

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
it's got like a new

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
there will be new reductionism

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
does it

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
I think every form of knowledge

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
is a simplification of reality

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
a model is a reduction

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
you should be aware that it is a reduction

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
as long as you're aware of that

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
I don't think there is much danger

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
in the moment you start taking

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
your model for reality that's when it

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
becomes dangerous because then you are

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
reductionist then you think that what your model

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
says is what the real world is

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
a model is something that helps

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
you to predict and to understand certain

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
things and if it turns out

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
that something that doesn't predict

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
doesn't understand that well then you may change

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
your model but you should not take the model

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
for reality model is by definition

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
simplification that means a reduction

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
reductionism

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
reductionism is to me

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
means that you

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
it's a world view where you

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
take the relationships into account

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
so you think that somehow the world can be

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
explained by things

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
but not really

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
their relationships are the interest

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
there is no reductionism is like that

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
but I think the reductionism that Derek

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
and Sima are talking about is the fact

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
that you reduce things to

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
some marks of a rightful

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
and of course

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
reality is more

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
comparing than those agencies

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
and of course it is more complex

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
of course this is a simplification

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
it's a simplification which no longer

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
assumes objects

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
it assumes process is an interrelationship

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
but still

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
when I try to represent it on the rightful

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
it's a simplification that's unavoidable

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
if I

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
the only way

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
to communicate the whole

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
of reality is to

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
experience the whole of reality

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
I can't transfer the whole of reality

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
to you, to your mind

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
I have to put it into language

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
and to Simba that is also simplification

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
the reductionism

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
can also take a different context and reactions

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
you just start from the most

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
basic particles

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
and then you can make it very complex

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
that is the advantage of this thing

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
it's what I would call an open underneath model

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
it's a model where you can

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
add and change things as much as you want

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
you don't have to make

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
certain assumptions that there are these particles

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
and they have these properties and no other copies

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
and they obey these flows

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
and no other goals

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
let's say reductionism you

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
make this ontological assumption

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
and they absolutely can't be changed

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
well here the only assumption that I make

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
is that there are conditions

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
that sometimes transform into other conditions

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
and if

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
these transformations

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
appear in a certain pattern

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
and I see that there is stability

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
and there is self-maintenance

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
and then I can start saying non-trivial things about them

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
but I don't

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
say what those ABCs

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
are and what the arrows

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
precisely are, I don't say when they happen

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
or how long they happen

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
that makes it open

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
it makes it flexible

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
time to finish

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
no it was

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
was that

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
so we move it to the bar

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
okay and thank you

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
thank you everybody online

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
I'm closing the results
