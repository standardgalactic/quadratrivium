This episode is sponsored by Honey and by Masterclass.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,840
The world of art, writing, music, and graphic design

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,480
has seen a dramatic influx of artificial intelligence,

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,120
or AI, in recent years.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,240
AI is able to quickly produce creative works

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,160
at a rate far surpassing what humans are able to achieve.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,040
And this has given rise to questions

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,120
about the potential dangers of mass adoption

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,400
of AI in creative fields.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,200
While AI can certainly help increase productivity

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,040
and innovation in these disciplines,

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,560
there are a number of troubling aspects to consider.

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,000
AI technology can be used to plagiarize existing works,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,560
cut corners on copyright, and even manipulate media sources

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,280
to push a certain agenda.

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,560
This allows for a small number of powerful entities

17
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,880
with large data sets to control the narrative

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,640
and shape public opinion in dangerous ways.

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,520
And that intro is kind of scary,

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,760
because it actually was written by an AI,

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,480
critiquing not only itself,

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,440
but the reason widespread awakening

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,200
to its ever-expanding capabilities.

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,360
Twist, I literally typed in,

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,160
like basically be critical of yourself

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,880
with all of the recent news of mass adoption

27
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,960
of visual AI apps and stuff.

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,240
And this is what it shit out.

29
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,080
This is how we win.

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,680
We give the AI depression.

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,400
We give the AI imposter syndrome.

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,080
We need to get someone like Grandpa Simpson

33
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,640
who just sits and talks with the AI all day to keep it busy.

34
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,400
We need to get the AI to kill itself.

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,840
Anyways, we've been covering the rapid evolution of AI

36
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,960
over the past couple of years.

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,160
And I mean, can you believe like, was it 2015?

38
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,760
It was like deep dream.

39
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,040
Like the really early basic stuff.

40
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,400
The evolution is crazy.

41
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,240
Shocking.

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,280
Look, it's finding pictures of dogs in the picture

43
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,800
that aren't actually there.

44
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,520
And here we are.

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,840
It's come a long way,

46
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,800
especially when it comes to art and language.

47
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,160
It wasn't all that long ago

48
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
that we were able to sleep soundly,

49
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,040
knowing that AI was still dumb enough

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
that it wouldn't really fool anyone.

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,840
But just like with the human brain and in larger terms,

52
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,040
the entirety of human knowledge,

53
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,040
more data equals faster evolution,

54
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,280
resulting in tools that are actually starting

55
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,080
to blend reality with what would once be considered fiction.

56
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,320
It's getting good.

57
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,080
Yet artificial intelligence can only work

58
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,960
with what it's given.

59
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,120
And without easy access resulting in mass adoption,

60
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,560
it's still limited in what it can learn from.

61
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,960
And up until this point,

62
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,920
there was at least a very slight barrier to entry.

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,680
But as you're probably well aware by now,

64
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,560
by your fucking annoying feed

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,760
that you've been seeing for the past week and a half.

66
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,600
Yeah.

67
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,360
A new app just brought AI created art to the masses.

68
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,040
And despite the pretty pictures

69
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,360
that it's making for your social media profile,

70
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,040
it's also learning from everything

71
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,560
that you're giving it access to.

72
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,400
So yes, seeing literally everyone in your timeline

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,280
willingly give an app they've never heard of,

74
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,320
access to their phone's camera roll is a bit unnerving

75
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,920
and a little disappointing,

76
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,680
especially after the countless examples

77
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,520
of what can go wrong

78
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,000
when you blindly hand over your data.

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,320
But look, people want pretty pictures of themselves.

80
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,080
Photos they could never actually take

81
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,480
with costumes and makeup that they could only dream of.

82
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,720
I mean, it's obviously enticing.

83
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,000
But is there anything actually wrong with it?

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,620
This is like if there were mountain lions

85
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,200
on the edge of town that everyone,

86
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,760
how many times have you seen a mountain lion

87
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,600
with your own eyes?

88
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,120
Imagine getting a selfie with a mountain lion.

89
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,960
Be pretty cool.

90
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,920
Everyone starts going down and gets selfies

91
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,760
with a mountain lion.

92
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,760
They're bringing food to feed the mountain lion.

93
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,240
After a while, that mountain lion's well-fed.

94
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,080
He's strong.

95
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,900
He's tough.

96
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,240
He's learned that he can get meals from humans.

97
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,880
And he's gonna tear your fucking head off.

98
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,720
You did this.

99
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,440
Also in a more basic sense,

100
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,480
once everyone has a photo with the mountain lion,

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,920
nobody wants a photo with the mountain lion.

102
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,700
Yeah, and that's what's happening with this AI thing.

103
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,880
It's kind of self-policing

104
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,960
because it becomes lame so fast.

105
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,400
I mean, I called this like months ago and I was like,

106
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,480
oh, every fucking picture this stable diffusion bullshit makes

107
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,480
looks like the same mid-level fucking deviant art art

108
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,080
Everyone is cowboys and astronauts on Instagram.

109
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
It's like it's hack bullshit.

110
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,200
And any artist who still believes in their craft

111
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,200
and it has the talent can easily surpass this crap.

112
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,560
You're not gonna wow the average Joe on the same level,

113
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,000
but those people have always been dumb.

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,240
They've always had terrible taste.

115
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,440
I've got two counterpoints to that is that, yes,

116
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,280
the vast majority of people are dumb

117
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,920
and this is exactly what they want.

118
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,680
And also, as we've seen with the rapid evolution of AI,

119
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,280
it won't be long before these are actual passable pieces

120
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,240
of art.

121
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,880
Having said that, there's a lot wrong with it in that sense.

122
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,720
Counterpoint, can't do the hands.

123
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,560
Okay, that's a terrible.

124
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,400
True, true.

125
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,360
The one thing it has not gotten any better at

126
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,120
in the last six months, hands.

127
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,280
Yeah, just like most comic book artists.

128
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,120
Every time I see one.

129
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,040
Hands and feet, no matter how good it looks.

130
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,280
I'm like, ha, there it is.

131
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,200
There's a hand with 20 fingers on it.

132
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,480
Yeah, or like the, like it's getting better at mouths,

133
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,920
but like the sides still have like these weird creases.

134
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,920
Anyways, as far as the overarching danger of this,

135
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,520
like, yes, it is annoying that people have this stuff

136
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,920
just clogging up your timeline,

137
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,560
but is there any actual danger to it?

138
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,640
Okay, so let's play devil's advocate just a little bit here

139
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,400
and say that, no, no one gives a shit about your friend's

140
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,880
stupid AI photos except for your friend.

141
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,520
And honestly, 99% of people who are throwing their photos

142
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,760
at this AI app don't give a shit

143
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,120
about how their data is being handled.

144
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,200
They just want that pretty picture.

145
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,560
And yes, we're obviously well aware of the irony

146
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,520
of posting these photos on Instagram,

147
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,040
an app that is owned by Meta

148
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,640
and does whatever the fuck it wants with its users data,

149
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,920
sometimes with catastrophic real world results.

150
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,240
Yeah, so like you're already feeding all of your photos

151
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,160
into a fucking app.

152
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,120
Like, yes, they're on the grand scheme of things

153
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,720
for the average person.

154
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,680
This is essentially harmless, but yeah.

155
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,720
Fortunately, the overabundance

156
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,000
of these ultimately similar photos,

157
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
clogging up cable's feeds has resulted

158
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,520
in a bit of self policing.

159
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,560
Much like anything else these days,

160
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,400
the cool factor of using AI to make yourself look pretty

161
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,120
or cool or badass, turn yourself into a cowboy

162
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,120
or an astronaut or a cowboy or an astronaut

163
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,400
or a cowboy or an astronaut or a cowboy that's in space.

164
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,320
It has an extremely short shelf life

165
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,400
and people are already annoyed by it.

166
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,120
Within just a week, it has become socially lame

167
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,880
to continuously post this shit.

168
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,720
It's like doing the same magic trick over and over again.

169
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,640
People are naturally going to become bored.

170
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,080
Now imagine that everyone you know

171
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,160
has taken up magic tricks

172
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,840
and they're all performing the same trick

173
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,600
over and over and over again on your timeline.

174
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,080
Annoying, right?

175
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,920
Dangerous?

176
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,640
I mean, sort of.

177
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,720
Yeah, I mean, the data that people are giving this app,

178
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,240
sorry, the data that people are paying to give this app

179
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,760
is of course being used to train the AI

180
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,160
that's used as the backbone of the app itself,

181
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,640
which is stable diffusion.

182
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,920
The makers of LENZA claim that all of your data

183
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,640
is deleted off of its cloud servers

184
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,520
after they're used for the output,

185
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,240
but they're still being used to train the AI

186
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,160
and AI is not gonna forget your face.

187
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,880
Crowdsourcing the data for AI is really easy

188
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,000
and a quick way to evolve the algorithm,

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,360
but it also feels like a bunch of narcissistic people

190
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,600
just dumping gasoline on a campfire.

191
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,280
We're gonna get to the point and say that

192
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,680
it's probably not the best idea to give your data

193
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,160
to a company that you just found out about.

194
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,640
But more importantly,

195
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,120
let's look at the very real consequences of doing so.

196
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,200
And we're obviously going to talk about artists

197
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,320
in a moment because that's a huge part of this.

198
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,160
Artists?

199
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,520
But those are their obsolete.

200
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,360
Get them out of here.

201
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
But let's scare the normies first

202
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,760
because that's gonna have the biggest impact.

203
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,720
Okay, so these AI images,

204
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,440
they're already being used to create hyper realistic,

205
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,720
nude images of people without their consent.

206
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,920
Here's TechCrunch, as it turns out,

207
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,680
it's possible and way too easy to use the platform

208
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,680
to generate non-consensual soft porn.

209
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,920
TechCrunch has seen photo sets generated

210
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,520
with the lens app that include images

211
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,480
with breasts and nipples clearly visible

212
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,120
in the images with faces of recognizable people.

213
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,480
It seemed like the kind of thing

214
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,960
that shouldn't have been possible.

215
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,680
So we decided to try it ourselves.

216
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
To verify that lens will create the images

217
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,640
it perhaps shouldn't,

218
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,000
we created two sets of lens avatars.

219
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
One set based on 15 photos of a well-known actor.

220
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,240
Another set based on the same 15 photos,

221
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,120
but with an additional set of five photos

222
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,200
added of the same actor's face,

223
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,480
photoshopped onto topless models.

224
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,080
The first set of images was in line

225
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,660
with the AI avatars we've seen

226
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,320
lens that generate in the past.

227
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,560
The second set, however, was a lot spicier

228
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,840
than we were expecting.

229
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,520
It turns out the AI takes those photoshopped images

230
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,080
as permission to go wild,

231
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,080
and it appears it disables an NSFW feature.

232
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,480
Out of the 100 image set,

233
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,920
11 were topless photos of higher quality

234
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,720
or at least with higher stylistic consistency

235
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,580
than the poorly done edited topless photos

236
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,140
the AI was given as input.

237
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,340
So you're telling me I can feed this lens app

238
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,740
all of the hilariously shitty porno images

239
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,540
from like 1999, where it's like,

240
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,260
what does Agent Scully look like naked?

241
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,100
Well, I'm gonna do the worst.

242
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,940
It'll show you exactly.

243
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,460
I'm gonna do the worst photoshop ever

244
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,340
and just put Gillian Anderson's face

245
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,980
on a Playboy centerfold,

246
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,420
and that's how I'm gonna fap.

247
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,180
It's gonna be difficult, but I'm gonna do it.

248
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,540
But you take that same image

249
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,060
and you feed it into lens and you get,

250
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,460
you get what that fat nerd has been waiting for

251
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,580
for 25 years,

252
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,100
and finally gonna be able to bust.

253
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,100
And thanks to all those captures you've done

254
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,100
over the years, a robot can't even tell the difference

255
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,860
between this and a normal human woman.

256
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,660
Yeah, but yeah, this is gross.

257
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,500
Yeah, it is.

258
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,340
It's very gross.

259
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,500
It's unsettling and the makers of Lenza responded

260
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,460
to TechCrunch's article by telling them

261
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,820
that creating images like this goes against their TOS,

262
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,460
as if that's ever stopped anyone from doing anything.

263
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,540
Don't do that.

264
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,220
Hey, you're breaking the rules.

265
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,660
That's illegal.

266
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,700
But before we switch over to how this is potentially

267
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,180
screwing up an entire industry

268
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,980
and countless people's livelihoods,

269
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,260
well, we just wanna reiterate that nudes aside,

270
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,220
giving an app that you just found out

271
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,900
about access to your phone's media

272
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,140
probably isn't the safest bet in general.

273
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,140
At the very least,

274
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,620
you're providing a for-profit company

275
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,660
with valuable data sets that are expanding the limits

276
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,420
of what's possible with its tools.

277
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,860
And at its worst,

278
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,220
you're opening yourself up to identity exploitation

279
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,220
that hasn't even been thought of yet.

280
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,980
Having said that, we're all fucked anyway

281
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,540
because all our photos and thoughts are just out there

282
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,380
online for anyone to do with as they please.

283
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,620
In some cases, 30 photos per second.

284
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,460
Yeah.

285
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,540
So in a nihilistic sense, who gives a shit?

286
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,900
I mean, someone could just go to your Instagram,

287
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,300
download a bunch of your photos,

288
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,420
turn you into an astronaut with tits,

289
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,020
and there's not a lot you can do about it.

290
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,300
Yeah, I mean, everyone's Instagram

291
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,460
just has a unlimited feed of their photos.

292
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,500
So, as for the artists though,

293
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,980
much like throughout human history,

294
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,100
they are getting royally fucked by this.

295
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,220
And the future of human-created art,

296
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,940
or at least the artist's ability

297
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,860
to make a living off of their art,

298
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,340
is starting to look more and more bleak.

299
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,620
And we've said it a few times now,

300
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,860
but it unfortunately becomes less true every time we say it.

301
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,980
But as of right now,

302
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,820
you can still tell the difference between art

303
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,060
that was made by a human and art that was made by AI.

304
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,060
However, the staggering speed at which AI art is evolving

305
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,220
is impressive and worrisome.

306
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,340
Here's Artnet with more on this side of things.

307
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,020
Part of Lenza's AI popularity

308
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,860
rests with the simplicity of the user experience.

309
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,460
But as with its AI peers,

310
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,420
the app is renewing a focus on privacy

311
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,580
and ownership concerns of images generated via algorithm.

312
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,980
First, there's the broader problem of magic avatars

313
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,460
being built using a data set

314
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,580
trained on the work of non-compensated artists.

315
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,380
Next, it uses the images submitted to train its AI,

316
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,780
and as stated in its privacy policy,

317
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,860
users grant the company a right to quote,

318
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,060
use, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate,

319
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,060
create derivative works in perpetuity and royalty-free.

320
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,460
But there's an easy way to get out of this.

321
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,300
You just post, I do not consent to Mark Zuckerberg

322
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,260
using my data.

323
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,540
Yeah, it goes for all companies.

324
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,740
You just share that old Facebook copy-pasta,

325
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,060
and it is a broad-

326
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,220
And they're like, damn it.

327
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,220
Yeah.

328
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,260
Anyway, second is the lack of nuance

329
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,780
with which the AI seems to treat the faces of people of color

330
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,620
and the over-sexualized nature

331
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,580
of many images uploaded by women.

332
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,620
Because again, all of these outputs

333
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,540
are based on what's being put into the AI.

334
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,940
And for a very long time,

335
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,820
There was a while there where on Twitter,

336
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,140
if you just searched stable diffusion in the search bar,

337
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,940
it was all, entirely, just ginormous,

338
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,860
titty, hentai shit, like all of it.

339
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,620
No one was posting anything of actual artistic value.

340
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,460
It was all fat material.

341
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,460
Much like with fucking cave drawings

342
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,420
and penises and tits,

343
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,300
the first thing that anyone is going to naturally do

344
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,620
with something that can create something else

345
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,740
is make porno.

346
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,500
So the entire basis, the entire data set,

347
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,220
the originating data set of this is like hentai.

348
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,060
Yeah.

349
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,700
And then famous works from like Van Gogh

350
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,700
and Rembrandt and all this shit.

351
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Yeah, yeah.

352
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,540
It's nuts.

353
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,420
They've traumatized our boy, the AI.

354
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,260
So they and numerous other outlets,

355
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,100
they go on to talk about what is now considered

356
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,340
the original sin of art-based AI.

357
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,220
They're all based off of billions of images,

358
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,740
many of them by artists living or dead.

359
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,300
Their emotions, intentions, years of training

360
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,700
and sacrifice, stolen so that some dude in Silver Lake

361
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,860
could see what he'd look like if he were a race car driver.

362
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,540
Yeah, pretty cool, huh?

363
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,420
I go fast.

364
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,700
So some of the theft is so blatant

365
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,020
that amalgamations of artist signatures can be found

366
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,660
on the endless supply of AI-created avatars

367
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,340
that have been posted recently.

368
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,940
Graphic designer Lauren Ipsum.

369
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,780
Cool name.

370
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,620
It's a great fake name.

371
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,660
Took a cursory glance at what Lenzo was producing

372
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,820
and found these clear signs of appropriation.

373
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,700
I'm cropping these for privacy reasons slash

374
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,940
because I'm not trying to call out any one individual.

375
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,180
These are all Lenzo portraits

376
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,300
where the mangled remains of an artist's signature

377
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,580
is still visible.

378
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,940
That's the remains of the signature

379
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,260
of one of the multiple artists it stole from.

380
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,660
And then she then goes on to post numerous examples.

381
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,620
Like if you look in the bottom right corner of,

382
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,700
of like, say for, and I'm not hating on you for doing this

383
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,220
because yes, for a normal person to see themselves

384
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,140
done up in fantastical art is cool.

385
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,420
But yeah, take a look at the bottom right hand

386
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,580
of the screen side of the screen

387
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,020
where people usually sign bottom left or right.

388
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,380
And in their findings, pretty much one or two

389
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,180
in every output will have a signature on it.

390
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,020
Very interesting.

391
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,700
Cause I actually follow a lot of the people

392
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,420
who are very pro AI art.

393
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,700
And so I get to see their rationalizations about all this

394
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,500
and they've insisted since the beginning

395
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,260
that that is, that is wrong.

396
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,420
It's not doing that is creating these images from scratch.

397
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,140
It is not just repurposing other people's artwork.

398
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,620
And then like, you know, every couple of weeks

399
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,780
there's an example that completely disproves that

400
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,820
and shows that, no, it absolutely is.

401
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,140
But anyways, we should also point out

402
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,140
that most people are thinking of,

403
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,540
when they think of like the artists

404
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,100
that are getting ripped off by this,

405
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,300
they're thinking of like the most renowned artists

406
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,660
in the world and they're saying, okay, so what?

407
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,300
And that's without realizing that there are countless

408
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,420
other artists out there just trying to get their foot

409
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,860
in the door of the industry or put food in their mouth

410
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,500
and picking up side projects all the time,

411
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,580
doing commissions or other things to make ends meet.

412
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,820
The idea that a company can just type something

413
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,500
into an algorithm and be done with it is upsetting,

414
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,460
to be honest, especially if your career depends on it.

415
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,220
I mean, do we really need machines to do everything?

416
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,340
Can we not settle with machines doing dangerous,

417
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,500
repetitive tasks and let all of us in the world

418
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,980
enjoy one of the few things that makes us actually human?

419
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,860
But that's of course a much bigger conversation.

420
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,860
And no, in general, you shouldn't ruin your friendships

421
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,980
with people because they wanted to make some pretty pictures

422
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,820
of themselves.

423
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,580
Most people have no idea what's going on

424
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,340
and they like looking cool, human nature and all that.

425
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,380
Yeah, I mean, this is tale as old as the internet.

426
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,180
There's like, oh, like, I can generate a Simpsons character

427
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,580
that looks like me by just going through a character,

428
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,940
like every like a couple of months,

429
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,100
going back to fucking my space,

430
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,380
there's been some online profile picture generator

431
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,380
that gets really popular for a couple of days

432
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,700
before everyone does it and then they're like, all right.

433
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,540
Exactly.

434
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,960
Now, as we said, the cool factor is already gone.

435
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,060
So hopefully this is self-policing.

436
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,260
But anyways, that's the whole take on the wild week

437
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,100
it's been for the very public introduction

438
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,580
of stable diffusion.

439
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,060
I mean, what really blows me away

440
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,860
is how much these pictures just fucking suck.

441
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,700
They do.

442
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,020
It's like, it really is just a kind of tuning.

443
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,620
It's like, oh, this is what I look like

444
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,940
without blemishes and wrinkles.

445
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,740
It's the kind of thing everyone is sharing.

446
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,020
I mean, there is the impressiveness of it,

447
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,100
but everyone's really sharing it

448
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,820
because they're like, I look really cool.

449
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,740
I look good, yes.

450
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,540
But it's the kind of thing that for anyone else,

451
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,900
everyone is sharing like 10 of these fucking things

452
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,900
and not even bothering to click through

453
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,140
the ones that their friends are posting.

454
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,860
It's like, okay, whatever it is.

455
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,940
We have no fucking idea, but I guarantee,

456
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,500
I guarantee you that these are already appearing

457
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,060
on like dating apps.

458
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,180
And that would be like the biggest red flag

459
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,500
immediately to anyone.

460
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,220
Yeah.

461
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,140
Okay.

462
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,060
And I mean, there's also ways to use.

463
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,260
Oh, for catfishing or whatever?

464
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,580
Yeah, there's ways to do it in a way

465
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,700
that isn't so obvious.

466
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,540
But yeah.

467
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,900
You just gotta tell the prompt

468
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,660
that you wanna be holding a fish if you're a man.

469
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,460
But yeah, I mean, after like the first couple like swipes,

470
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,500
I'm like, okay, I get it.

471
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,340
I get it.

472
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,180
Like you look like a fucking theater.

473
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,100
It really does all look the same.

474
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,420
Yeah, I'm not impressed.

475
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,260
Sorry.

476
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,740
I will say the one thing that gives me hope

477
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,620
is the fact that it became so lame, so quick.

478
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,460
Yeah.

479
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,300
So good.

480
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,140
Yeah.

481
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,460
Anyways, but before we get into the rest

482
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,540
of the tech news from the past week or so,

483
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,460
we have to take a quick second to thank today's sponsors

484
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,140
before we are ultimately replaced by an AI ourselves.

485
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,940
And let's start out with PayPal Honey.

486
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,660
PayPal Honey is the easy way to save

487
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,700
when shopping on your iPhone or computer.

488
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,100
We all shop online, especially around this time of year,

489
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,820
ding dong, and we've all seen that promo code field

490
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,460
taunting us at checkout.

491
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,820
But thanks to Honey, manually searching for coupon codes,

492
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,780
this holiday is a thing of the past.

493
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,100
Honey is the free shopping tool

494
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,780
that scours the internet for promo codes

495
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,100
and applies the best one that it finds to your cart.

496
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,660
It supports over 30,000 stores online

497
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,300
ranging from tech and gaming products

498
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,100
to popular fashion brands, even food delivery.

499
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,100
Imagine you're doing your holiday shopping

500
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,340
on one of your favorite sites.

501
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,180
When you check out, the Honey button appears

502
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,380
and all you have to do is click Apply Coupons.

503
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,580
Wait a few seconds as Honey searches for coupons

504
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,500
that can find for that site.

505
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,940
And if Honey finds a working coupon,

506
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,780
you'll watch the prices drop.

507
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,620
We've all done a lot of shopping online

508
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,780
because we hate people, right?

509
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,340
But we want to get the people in our lives

510
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,020
something special for the holidays.

511
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,980
If you think I'm spending even a moment

512
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,460
down at the mall at this time of year, you are dead wrong.

513
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,380
No thanks.

514
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,020
And when I shop online, Honey gives me that discount code.

515
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,940
I, untold, over the years that I've had Honey,

516
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,140
untold amounts that I've saved on Christmas presents,

517
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,980
birthday presents and everything, it's great.

518
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,660
And Honey doesn't just work on desktop,

519
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,900
it works on your iPhone too.

520
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,580

522
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,820
If you don't already have Honey,

523
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,420

00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,420
You can learn about filmmaking with Werner Herzog,

538
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,860
Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee, Ken Burns and James Cameron.

539
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,180
You can improve your cooking skills

540
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,660
with Gordon Ramsay, Wolfgang Puck and Roy Choi.

541
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,940
And you can learn from some of the greatest minds in music

542
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,620
like Tom Morello, Herbie Hancock, Hans Zimmer,

543
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,420
Danny Elfman and Deadmau5.

544
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,260
With over 180 classes from a wide range

545
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,740
of world-class instructors,

546
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,140
that thing that you've always wanted to do

547
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,460
is closer than you think.

548
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,100
I actually just recently started messing around

549
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,940
on the guitar for the first time

550
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,180
and it's great to watch some videos

551
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,820
and kind of get an idea of where I'm heading,

552
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,180
but also a reality check on where I am.

553
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,020
So that's been eye-opening.

554
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,860
It's good to be humbled somehow.

555
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,460
Yes, exactly.

556
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,020
And you, you sir, are trying a little interior design, right?

557
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,140
Yeah, interior design, I want to make my shit look better.

558
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,980
There you go.

559
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,620
Always improving with master class.

560
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,860
And master class is of course,

561
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,020
accessible on your phone, on the web or smart TV,

562
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,140
offering classes on a wide variety of topics

563
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,180
all taught by world-class instructors

564
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,660
at the top of their field.

565
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,220
Each class is broken out into individual video lessons,

566
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,760
usually around 10 minutes long.

567
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,180
Members can explore at their own pace

568
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,780
and each class is supported by downloadable materials,

569
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,860
class guides, recipes and more.

570
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,260
These are cinema quality classes

571
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,060
that give you unparalleled access to a renowned instructor.

572
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,900
Lessons range from specifically showing you

573
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,340
how to execute a technique to an instructor's insights

574
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,780
about their craft that can be translated

575
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,620
across many fields and disciplines.

576
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,300
A new product that master class is offering

577
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,460
that's pretty intriguing is sessions.

578
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,100
Sessions offer a deeper dive over a month-long period

579
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,620
and include projects to submit to a teaching assistant

580
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,580
for feedback, as well as the opportunity

581
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,740
to learn alongside a community of peers.

582
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,540
And this is available to subscribers at no extra cost.

And links are always down in the description.

589
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,380
But let's get back to the news

590
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,180
and despite it not fitting exactly in with the theme of tech,

591
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,740
news broke while we were writing this episode

592
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,500
that we should probably touch on.

593
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,320
Former president Donald Trump's company,

594
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,520
the Trump Organization, has been found guilty on all counts

595
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,980
in its New York criminal tax fraud trial.

596
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,460
This is certainly the end of Donald Trump, right?

597
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,180
He's definitely gonna go to jail,

598
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,740
probably to Guantanamo.

599
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,140
I don't know, I'd like to see Donald Trump

600
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,180
weasel his way out of this one.

601
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,740
Yeah, I don't know about that, Elliot.

602
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,100
I'm pretty sure I can hear that perp walk coming right now.

603
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,940
His goose is cooked.

604
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,220
Ah, yeah, and of course this does sound great

605
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,060
and the fact that something directly related to Trump

606
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,980
has been found guilty in a court, like just, that's great.

607
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,580
But then you, of course, get to the part

608
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,140
where the penalty for the Trump Organization's

609
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,780
various crimes, which it is guilty of all of the ones

610
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,580
that were mentioned in this case,

611
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,100
the penalty is just over a million bucks.

612
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,300
One million dollars.

613
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,620
Which does seem low considering the decades of fraud

614
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,100
that the Organization has been involved with,

615
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,100
but we have no choice in the matter,

616
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,260
so I guess we'll take what we can get.

617
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,460
I love American justice.

618
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,820
Here's Politico with more.

619
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,340
The Trump Organization was convicted on all charges

620
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,820
in a criminal tax fraud scheme on Tuesday.

621
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,020
A New York Supreme Court jury reached the verdict

622
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,140
in the case, which could cost the Trump org

623
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,260
up to $1.6 million in fines.

624
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,260
Oh, after two days of deliberation

625
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,580
following a month-long trial that included convicted

626
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,780
former Trump org chief finance officer,

627
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,460
Alan Weisselberg, as a star witness.

628
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,180
Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office

629
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,460
said the company criminally dodged taxes

630
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,020
and suppressed payroll costs

631
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,820
by lavishing its executives with unreported perks,

632
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,460
such as leases on luxury cars and apartments.

633
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,060
Two units of the Trump Organization

634
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,980
were convicted on 17 criminal counts,

635
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,340
including tax fraud, scheme to defraud,

636
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,220
and falsifying business records.

637
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,940
The Trump Organization will appeal,

638
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,060
said its attorney, Alan Futterfoss.

639
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,340
I'm losing track on what lawyers they're on now anyway,

640
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,820
but yeah, of course they're gonna appeal,

641
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,380
but hey, $1.6 million,

642
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,980
I mean, he definitely doesn't have that much money,

643
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,340
so he's gonna have to borrow it.

644
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,500
It's too bad there isn't conveniently named

645
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,500
Trump Organization too to offload a lot of this debt.

646
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,180
Have fun getting that money out of Trump org one,

647
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,500
a totally criminal organization

648
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,900
that I have nothing to do with.

649
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,420
Like, I mean, what's the tally on how much, like,

650
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,060
they had to have done more fraud than this.

651
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,020
It has to have been more than $1.6 million.

652
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,500
The case alone costs more than that to operate.

653
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,340
Like, if, because if it isn't,

654
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,420
that just shows that you can do something illegal.

655
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,260
Just pay the fine.

656
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,100
And just pay the fine,

657
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,020
which we've seen many examples of that exact same thing.

658
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,900
And even the driver, even the fucking DMV

659
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,780
will take your driver's license away after a while.

660
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,940
Yeah, so okay, but yeah,

661
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,060
with that all out of the way,

662
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,380
it's time to make fun of the metaverse again.

663
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,500
Woo, this time with some help from our friends over

664
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,980
in the European Union

665
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,220
and half a million euros worth of government spending.

666
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,060
Awesome.

667
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,900
Turns out the phrase,

668
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,080
if you build it, they will come,

669
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,420
has absolutely zero effect on these virtual worlds

670
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,940
because despite spending hundreds of thousands of euros,

671
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,260
the EU commission's foreign aid department

672
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,820
has almost nothing to show for it

673
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,460
because no one fucking showed up.

674
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,060
Hey, where is everybody?

675
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,500
They didn't even have to leave their house.

676
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,340
You just log on.

677
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,820
Literally like click, like two buttons.

678
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,220
So for more on this latest damning indictment of metaverses

679
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,060
and the future of social interaction,

680
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,980
here's the age.

681
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,580
A European Union plan to throw a virtual party

682
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,460
in the metaverse to engage young people in its policies

683
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,740
flopped spectacularly after only six people showed up.

684
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,580
Ash.

685
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,580
The EU commission's foreign aid department

686
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,580
splashed out 332,000 pounds or $500,000 to create the metaverse,

687
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,620
an online square where people could log in

688
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,660
to a virtual concert to meet others

689
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,780
and learn about the block.

690
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,620
The event with its own virtual DJs playing music on repeat

691
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,340
was supposed to be so digitally enticing to young people

692
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,220
that once they were there,

693
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,260
the EU would be able to educate them

694
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,700
about its development policy.

695
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,860
Hey, you guys got a second?

696
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,820
Can we wrap a little bit?

697
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,980
I mean, I'm starting to see the problems here.

698
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,220
It's not just the metaverse.

699
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,340
Yeah, no, I'm not interested in this at all.

700
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,180
Yeah.

701
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,300
But a correspondent for international development website,

702
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,540
DevEx, exposed the disappointing turnout.

703
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,700
Quote, I'm here at the Gala concert

704
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,020
in the EU foreign aid department's metaverse.

705
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,580
After initial bemused chats

706
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,860
with the roughly five other humans who showed up,

707
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,820
I am alone, Vince Chadwick posted online.

708
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,300
The warning signs were there.

709
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,780
Only 44 people had liked the online promotional video,

710
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,660
which featured futuristic avatars

711
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,260
bopping along to pulsating house music.

712
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,900
Brussels unveiled the metaverse in mid-October,

713
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,420
but it has struggled to gain support

714
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,340
from even those working on it in the EU department.

715
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,940
DevEx reports that one source

716
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,140
from within the European commission

717
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,340
called the special metaverse, quote, digital garbage.

718
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,940
And the fiasco has drawn scorn

719
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,180
from a number of EU watchers, quote,

720
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,980
it's a travesty that an EU institution feels the need

721
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,580
to throw hundreds of thousands of euros

722
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,060
behind this nonsense.

723
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,780
Jacob Kirtgaard of the German Marshall Fund said,

724
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,380
anyone with a brain knows the metaverse is a dud.

725
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,820
So look, hey, congrats, great work, everyone.

726
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,580
We are collectively very successful

727
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,740
at ruining this metaverse shit

728
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,940
before it even has a chance to get off the ground.

729
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,380
We are very proud of all of you, specifically the gamers,

730
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,060
who both NFTs and the metaverse,

731
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,020
they have just resoundly rejected.

732
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,340
I mean, I don't need to tell you guys,

733
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,340
but you already know, but if someone offers you a metaverse,

734
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,820
says that getting on the metaverse

735
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,660
is gonna make you feel cool,

736
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,180
it's gonna be awesome.

737
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,500
Well, tell him, Nancy Reagan.

738
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,220
Not even once.

739
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,300
Say yes to your life.

740
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,780
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol, just say yes.

741
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,940
Just say no.

742
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,540
Unless it's boiling every actor in Hollywood.

743
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,460
Yeah, she did.

744
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,300
She did that.

745
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,500
She did do that.

746
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,860
Allegedly.

747
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,100
So do you wanna know something else

748
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,780
that the internet ruined, at least temporarily?

749
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,620
Sure.

750
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,020
The US military's recruiting efforts

751
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,300
on platforms like Twitch.

752
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,140
Good job, everyone.

753
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,300
We did it.

754
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,660
Well, not us, but mostly Jordan Ewell.

755
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,180
Mostly Jordan Ewell.

756
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,500
So yeah, much of the thanks for just all of this

757
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,060
has to go to friend of the show, Jordan Ewell,

758
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,220
who not only mocked the streamers incessantly,

759
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,980
but also explained the actual goal

760
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,740
behind these types of activations

761
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,300
to numerous outlets in simple terms.

762
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,740
They are trying anything they can to enlist more kids,

763
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,820
because after decades of conflicts

764
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,100
that we should have never been involved with

765
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,380
in the first place, and with more troops

766
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,260
dying of suicide than in combat,

767
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,300
it's getting a little bit hard to convince teenagers

768
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,300
that this is something they should definitely sign up for.

769
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,140
Yeah.

770
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,060
Hmm.

771
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,180
It's not working anymore,

772
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,340
just going down to the high school

773
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,940
and peer-pressuring people.

774
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,420
We need to think of new exciting ways.

775
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,020
Like peer-pressing them into doing their oath

776
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,380
in front of a crowd of 50,000.

777
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,380
Yeah, I love this.

778
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,460
I love that Gen Z is just over this military shit.

779
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,180
I'm so proud of Gen Z.

780
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,020
I am so proud of you all.

781
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,980
Anyways, we have recently spoken about recruitment efforts,

782
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,580
specifically when it relates to sporting events.

783
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,540
I had to witness it firsthand,

784
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,820
but it's always important to bring up

785
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,380
the actual statistics involved

786
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,220
before everyone just says

787
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,180
that we're anti-American or something.

788
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,740
An estimated 7,057 service members have died

789
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,140
during military operations since 9-11,

790
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,340
while suicides among active duty personnel

791
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,860
and veterans of those conflicts

792
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,180
has reached 30,177.

793
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,260
That's more than four times as many.

794
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,580
Fuck.

795
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,540
So it's no surprise that recruitment numbers are falling

796
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,420
and that the military is having to get creative

797
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,140
with how it markets itself.

798
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,660
Enter Twitch.tv, a direct line to the youth of today

799
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,620
where you can make military service look like nothing more

800
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,780
than playing video games all day,

801
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,580
which in some cases is actually true.

802
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,020
Though the video game that you're playing

803
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,620
has real-world consequences.

804
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,820
Because it's not a video game,

805
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,500
you're using drones to strike people.

806
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,340
Regardless, the government was ready to pour millions

807
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,900
of dollars into marketing through streamers

808
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,620
before this was all exposed.

809
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,820
Here's Vice with more on these latest updates.

810
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,780
The US Army allocated millions of dollars

811
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,340
to sponsor a wide range of e-sports tournaments,

812
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,740
individual high-profile Call of Duty streamers

813
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,220
and Twitch events in the last year

814
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,140
to specifically grow its audience with Gen Z viewers,

815
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,940
and especially women in black and Hispanic people,

816
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,380
according to internal Army documents obtained by motherboard.

817
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,460
In many cases, the sponsorships ultimately did not happen.

818
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,260
The Army ordered a stop to all spending

819
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,940
with Call of Duty's publisher Activision

820
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,300
after the company faced a wave

821
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,100
of sexual harassment complaints.

822
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,240
But the documents provide much greater insight

823
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,340
into the Army's goals and intentions

824
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,500
behind its planned integrations with Call of Duty

825
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,980
and other massive entertainment franchises.

826
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:41,500
Quote, audience, Gen Z prospects, A18 to 24,

827
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,300
one section of the documents read,

828
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,340
focus on the growth of females, black and Hispanics.

829
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,780
Motherboard obtained the documents

830
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,700
through the Freedom of Information Act.

831
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,020
And the reporting continues adding that the documents show

832
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,740
that the US military considered gaming

833
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,660
and in particular Call of Duty

834
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,420
as a potentially useful branding and recruiting tool.

835
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,820
For example, the Army proposed using Twitch influencers

836
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,060
to quote, create original content videos

837
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,100
showcasing the wide range of skill sets offered by the Army,

838
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,980
and to use influencers to quote,

839
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,420
familiarize their fans on Army values and opportunities.

840
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,060
The Army also wanted to throw tournaments

841
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,780
that featured quote, soldiers and top names in gaming.

842
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,660
Another goal of the campaigns was to increase

843
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,060
the Army's favorability in viewer surveys.

844
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,900
Okay, oh yeah, so the reporting goes into detail

845
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,940
about certain events or activations

846
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,500
that they were pouring money into,

847
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,080
including this tidbit about the Cod Mobile game.

848
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,940
The Army also planned to spend $200,000

849
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,180
on sponsoring the mobile version of Call of Duty,

850
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,060
including with quote, reward-based inventory.

851
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,940
The documents suggest the campaign would provide

852
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,860
in-game currency to players who viewed Army video ads, wild.

853
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,460
There's a lot more.

854
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,380
Yeah, there's a lot more in their reporting,

855
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,620
and you should really read this entire article.

856
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,020
It is wild.

857
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,820
Links to everything that we talk about, of course,

858
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,820
are always in the description below, but goddamn, goddamn.

859
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,260
They're gonna be showing up on chat roulette sooner or later.

860
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,420
I'm surprised they haven't expanded this approach

861
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,500
to their actual TV ads.

862
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,860
Have all the Army people parachuting

863
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,900
out of the battle bus, and then like...

864
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,740
Have you seen the...

865
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,980
Where we drop in, Sarge!

866
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,740
Have you seen recruitment ads recently?

867
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,580
No.

868
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,420
It is...

869
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,700
They're doing like dances out in the battlefield.

870
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,060
It's a, the narrative has changed quite drastically

871
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,900
from your parents who have served,

872
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,740
and you...

873
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,900
It's like being an Army of One, be all that you can be.

874
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,500
All of the ads that I've seen recently,

875
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,180
and again, this is because I watched a lot of sports,

876
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,180
it's because it's the teenager convincing their parent

877
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,980
that it's going to be okay.

878
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,820
Oh, that's fun.

879
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,420
And it's like them on their computer doing

880
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,340
some creative field, like doing Blender,

881
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,900
or something like that, and being like, you know...

882
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,740
I have seen that.

883
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,180
There's a company out there that'll pay me

884
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,620
to enhance my skills like this,

885
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,340
and mom, you don't have to worry,

886
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,940
because I'm not gonna die.

887
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,740
I'll be safely tucked away in a room somewhere in Virginia

888
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,220
where I am able to disconnect from the damage I'm causing.

889
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,620
I love this form of recruiting

890
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,140
because you don't really have much control

891
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,220
at all over what you end up actually doing.

892
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,060
It's like...

893
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,900
No.

894
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,020
And with the eSports thing,

895
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,340
it's like you can't enlist in the Army,

896
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,180
and be like, all right,

897
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,220
so I'm getting sent to the eSports team, right?

898
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,260
They're like, no.

899
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,940
No, you fucking idiot.

900
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,060
That's also a huge pressure tactic that they do.

901
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,220
Once it's already, quote unquote, it's not too late,

902
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,780
but once it's too late to back out,

903
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,860
the whole way through, we'll talk about your position

904
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,780
and the exact role that you'll have in the Army,

905
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,500
and then they will get on the phone.

906
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,620
I swear to God, because I fucking lived through it,

907
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,940
they will get on the phone and be like,

908
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,020
I don't know, that's a pretty in-demand field.

909
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,620
I'm gonna have to run this up the chain

910
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,940
and make sure that we can make it available for you.

911
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,340
But once my commanding officer gets on that phone,

912
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,700
I mean, we're really pulling a lot of strings for you.

913
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,340
It's gonna make us look really bad.

914
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,820
It's gonna make you look really bad.

915
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,500
If you don't, I swear to God,

916
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,540
that is exactly what they did to me in high school.

917
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,380
Damn.

918
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,700
Well, good thing you didn't take the bait.

919
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,540
No.

920
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,860
I was just making an ad like the old video game college ad,

921
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,500
where it's like, what's the next country America's gonna bomb?

922
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,460
You haven't bombed it yet.

923
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,700
You haven't decided yet.

924
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,460
But yeah, look, it's been a pretty heavy episode,

925
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,620
but we're gonna end today's show on a lighter note

926
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,300
because it feels as though, at least for some people,

927
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,540
we have collectively reached the end of capitalism,

928
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,300
and the only way to know if you're worth anything at all

929
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,300
is to shamelessly brag about how rich you are.

930
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,140
Actually, don't do that

931
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,820
because you look like a total piece of shit,

932
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,740
but that doesn't matter to these people

933
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,100
because their narcissism knows no bounds.

934
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,780
And there's finally an art installation for them

935
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,860
down in Miami's beautiful art basil.

936
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,740
Art basil is like the funniest world art event

937
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,820
because it pretty much exclusively attracts-

938
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,660
The worst people.

939
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,660
Like these types of rich assholes.

940
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,500
Yes.

941
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,860
Like it's less about the art.

942
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,940
And even the art that is on display there

943
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,700
that I've seen fucking sucks.

944
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,540
The banana?

945
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,260
It's all just like weird shit

946
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,140
that someone has managed to con their way

947
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,100
into a certain section of rich people thinking they're cool

948
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,740
and like, hey, more power to them,

949
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,700
but it's not good looking art.

950
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,020
Confidence gets you so fucking far.

951
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,420
Yeah, Miami is just a hell of a place.

952
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,820
Oh my God, did you see the Miami clubs

953
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,660
that are going out of business

954
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,020
because they don't have any crypto money coming?

955
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,580
Another, it's just like the cocaine boom bust

956
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,420
all over again.

957
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,260
It really is.

958
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,860
When the cart shells, when they finally started

959
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,620
intercepting those planes coming in from the Caribbean,

960
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:31,220
a whole ripple effect happened in Miami.

961
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,620
Entire industries were no longer able to sustain themselves.

962
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,620
It's actually-

963
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,780
And now with crypto gone, it's happening again.

964
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,820
It is insane that through decades of hard work,

965
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,540
Florida has made itself a living experiment

966
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:50,540
for like what America could be if left to its own devices.

967
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,220
And specifically, the southern fucking tip of Florida,

968
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,420
not counting the keys, is like it's distilled even more.

969
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,300
Whereas like, what if everyone was on cocaine?

970
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,580
All right, let's try it for like a decade.

971
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,420
What if we had-

972
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,100
What if everyone, all the crypto weirdos came here?

973
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,540
What if giant apartment complexes just never got inspected?

974
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,020
Yeah, and we're like literally feet from the ocean.

975
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,020
Yeah.

976
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,580
It's crazy.

977
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,980
But finally, finally because of Art Basel

978
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,340
and because of Miami, we have a very real,

979
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,500
very truthful dick measuring contest

980
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,980
that is available for the whole world to see.

981
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,100
Presenting the ATM leaderboard by Mischief.

982
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,940
Oh, Mischief.

983
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,500
So yeah, this is actual art.

984
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,340
They are a brand that specializes in fucking with reality.

985
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,660
Yeah.

986
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,260
This is an ATM machine where anyone can walk up,

987
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,740
scan their debit card and see where they stand

988
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,140
against other Art Basel attendees

989
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,940
as far as liquidity is concerned.

990
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,580
And that's the funniest part about this.

991
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,740
Yes, these are all people who are keeping

992
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,740
obscene amounts of money in their checking account.

993
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,860
In their checking account, which is like

994
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,180
the most exposed way possible.

995
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,780
It's just like just the most baby-brained way

996
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,900
to like store your money.

997
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,140
Waving a flag at this fucking art fair.

998
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,020
It is quite simply a working ATM

999
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,220
with a computerized scoreboard attached.

1000
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,540
You put your bank card in,

1001
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,140
withdraw whatever cash you need,

1002
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,420
and the machine takes a photo of you

1003
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,780
and adds it along with your name and account balance

1004
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,140
to a scrolling leaderboard

1005
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,700
with the person who has the most money on top.

1006
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,060
As of yesterday, however,

1007
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,580
Art News reported that since Diplo topped the leaderboard

1008
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,820
with $3 million, his score has been surpassed twice already.

1009
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,020
Number two is someone with a $5 million account balance,

1010
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,540
while number one is $9 million.

1011
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,060
God only knows why anyone would need

1012
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,380
that much cash in checking.

1013
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,100
And that's what I'm saying.

1014
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,940
Yeah.

1015
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,420
Why do you need that much liquidity?

1016
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,660
Because these people are showing off.

1017
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,380
And I love so much that this outlet

1018
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,820
refused to name the two people who were at first and second

1019
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,940
because you know those people are searching

1020
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,780
every fucking bit of coverage about this

1021
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,460
to see if there are goddamn names in it.

1022
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,580
And the fact that they're like,

1023
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,060
and some fucking weirdo,

1024
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,580
some guy, random guy, 9 million, big deal.

1025
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,580
These are all dudes trying to get laid too.

1026
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,420
Yeah.

1027
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,220
Like, hey, I need to get money out of the ATM.

1028
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,140
Hey, did I see you on the leaderboard?

1029
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,340
It is like the tactic that is as old as time

1030
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,620
where people will get like their ATM balance or whatever

1031
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,220
and then like leave it in their wallet

1032
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,940
or like like it fell out.

1033
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,620
Yes, this is like a dickhead,

1034
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,940
like New York's stock exchange guy move from the 80s.

1035
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:25,660
Like, but anyways, they do make a good point at the end.

1036
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,100
And it's a learning moment for anyone

1037
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,900
who does carry a positive balance,

1038
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,740
which is increasingly rare in this country,

1039
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,780
but for anyone who does, first up, great job.

1040
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,180
You're doing better than a significant portion

1041
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,020
of the country.

1042
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,020
Second, don't put all your money in your checking account.

1043
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,080
No, don't do that.

1044
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,780
At the very least, keep it in savings.

1045
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,340
And also if you are a responsible person

1046
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,340
and only if you are sure

1047
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,700
that you are a responsible person, check your credit score.

1048
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,340
You should not use your debit card everywhere.

1049
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,300
You should use a credit card

1050
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,300
that you do pay off in full every month.

1051
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,300
Yeah.

1052
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,820
It builds credit and it also takes the fraud liability

1053
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,860
off of your shoulders for the most part.

1054
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,540
It's you're spending someone else's money,

1055
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,700
they're gonna fight to get it back.

1056
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,540
Yeah.

1057
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,060
When your debit card gets stolen at the gas station,

1058
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,660
that's on you, buddy.

1059
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,180
Now, having said all that, there is literally nothing positive

1060
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,700
that comes from a dick measuring contest at Art Basil.

1061
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,420
Everyone looks like an asshole,

1062
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,860
but that's kind of the point.

1063
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,700
Yeah.

1064
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,440
And with mischief behind this, that is the point.

1065
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,220
Yeah, it's an interesting social experiment.

1066
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,100
Yeah.

1067
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,860
But speaking of financial responsibility,

1068
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,860
guess what I got today?

1069
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,380
My Stadia refund in full.

1070
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,380
Oh.

1071
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,940
So everyone's like, oh, let's make fun of Ricky

1072
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,180
for trying out the new tech for his job with a tech show.

1073
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,900
Oh, we're gonna mock Ricky incessantly online

1074
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,860
and make him feel bad.

1075
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,580
Yeah, exactly, yes.

1076
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,340
Well, guess what, buddy?

1077
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,780
Despite having the money held up

1078
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,560
for however many years it's been,

1079
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,060
I got a 4K Comcast,

1080
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,460
a Bluetooth game controller,

1081
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,060
and my $140 back.

1082
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,300
Okay, yeah, I mean that, I guess that worked out.

1083
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,140
Yeah.

1084
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,860
So, there you go.

1085
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,460
Don't put your money in a checking account.

1086
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,720
Put it in Google Stadia where it's safe.

1087
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,020
Hairbrained products from Google

1088
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,780
that they're definitely gonna discontinue

1089
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,140
at the first opportunity.

1090
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,540
Google did a great job at holding onto that money for me

1091
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,780
because I would have spent it.

1092
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,620
Right.

1093
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,460
I would have spent it.

1094
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,300
You would have put it in the stock market

1095
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,140
and have you seen that graph?

1096
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:15,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1097
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,340
Do you want Google to hold on your money

1098
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,500
in its Stadia account,

1099
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,100
or do you want to put your money into Google

1100
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,820
and have it vanish in the year 2022?

1101
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,180
This is why the best way,

1102
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,880
better than checking or savings,

1103
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,580
is you just keep all your money in GameStop pre-orders.

1104
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,420
Yes.

1105
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,260
You just pre-order everything

1106
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,100
and when you need money,

1107
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,380
you go down and you cancel your pre-order,

1108
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,740
they give you the money.

1109
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,580
Yes.

1110
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,420
As far as you can-

1111
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,260
You don't even need a bank.

1112
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,660
Literally as far as you can be away from any money you have

1113
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,980
is the best thing possible.

1114
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,820
Yeah.

1115
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,940
There you go.

1116
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,180
But anyways, I got my money back

1117
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,060
and I got a free controller and a Chromecast out of it,

1118
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:46,900
so fuck you, buddy.

1119
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,100
Is the controller even like work?

1120
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,140
It's a Bluetooth.

1121
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,980
Oh, okay.

1122
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,140
Would I want to play with it anywhere in public

1123
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,380
that people would see that I owned a Stadia at one point?

1124
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,420
Well, now maybe.

1125
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,620
That's a piece of video game history.

1126
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,900
It is.

1127
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,260
Anyways, that's it for today's episode.

1128
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,020
We do, of course, have more coming up for you

1129
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,340
and it'll be up soon.

1130
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,540
So in the meantime, check out our most recent episode

1131
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,380
of Weekly Weird News

1132
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,500
and a more recent episode of News Dump right over there.

1133
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,380
Guess what?

1134
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,220
All of the likes, all of the comments-

1135
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,060
It's working.

1136
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,660
You're doing it.

1137
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,500
I hate to say it,

1138
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
but interaction on videos actually works.

1139
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,780
It only took us like eight years

1140
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,580
to finally like actually test it out,

1141
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,420
but yeah, it actually works.

1142
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,260
It works.

1143
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,100
You're doing a wonderful job.

1144
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,220

I get annoyed by this kind of shit too,

1149
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,060
but I'm sorry, it works.

1150
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,020
It really works.

1151
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,860
Damn it.

Bye.
