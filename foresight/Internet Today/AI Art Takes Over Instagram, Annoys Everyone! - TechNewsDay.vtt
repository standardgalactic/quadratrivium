This episode is sponsored by Honey and by Masterclass.

00:03.080 --> 00:05.840
The world of art, writing, music, and graphic design

00:05.840 --> 00:08.480
has seen a dramatic influx of artificial intelligence,

00:08.480 --> 00:10.120
or AI, in recent years.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.240
AI is able to quickly produce creative works

00:12.240 --> 00:15.160
at a rate far surpassing what humans are able to achieve.

00:15.160 --> 00:17.040
And this has given rise to questions

00:17.040 --> 00:19.120
about the potential dangers of mass adoption

00:19.120 --> 00:21.400
of AI in creative fields.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.200
While AI can certainly help increase productivity

00:24.200 --> 00:26.040
and innovation in these disciplines,

00:26.040 --> 00:28.560
there are a number of troubling aspects to consider.

00:28.560 --> 00:32.000
AI technology can be used to plagiarize existing works,

00:32.000 --> 00:35.560
cut corners on copyright, and even manipulate media sources

00:35.560 --> 00:37.280
to push a certain agenda.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.560
This allows for a small number of powerful entities

00:39.560 --> 00:41.880
with large data sets to control the narrative

00:41.880 --> 00:44.640
and shape public opinion in dangerous ways.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.520
And that intro is kind of scary,

00:46.520 --> 00:49.760
because it actually was written by an AI,

00:49.760 --> 00:51.480
critiquing not only itself,

00:51.480 --> 00:53.440
but the reason widespread awakening

00:53.440 --> 00:55.200
to its ever-expanding capabilities.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.360
Twist, I literally typed in,

00:57.360 --> 00:59.160
like basically be critical of yourself

00:59.160 --> 01:01.880
with all of the recent news of mass adoption

01:01.880 --> 01:03.960
of visual AI apps and stuff.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.240
And this is what it shit out.

01:05.240 --> 01:06.080
This is how we win.

01:06.080 --> 01:07.680
We give the AI depression.

01:07.680 --> 01:10.400
We give the AI imposter syndrome.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.080
We need to get someone like Grandpa Simpson

01:13.080 --> 01:15.640
who just sits and talks with the AI all day to keep it busy.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.400
We need to get the AI to kill itself.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.840
Anyways, we've been covering the rapid evolution of AI

01:20.840 --> 01:22.960
over the past couple of years.

01:22.960 --> 01:26.160
And I mean, can you believe like, was it 2015?

01:26.160 --> 01:27.760
It was like deep dream.

01:27.760 --> 01:30.040
Like the really early basic stuff.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.400
The evolution is crazy.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.240
Shocking.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.280
Look, it's finding pictures of dogs in the picture

01:34.280 --> 01:35.800
that aren't actually there.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.520
And here we are.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.840
It's come a long way,

01:38.840 --> 01:41.800
especially when it comes to art and language.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.160
It wasn't all that long ago

01:43.160 --> 01:45.160
that we were able to sleep soundly,

01:45.160 --> 01:47.040
knowing that AI was still dumb enough

01:47.040 --> 01:49.040
that it wouldn't really fool anyone.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.840
But just like with the human brain and in larger terms,

01:51.880 --> 01:54.040
the entirety of human knowledge,

01:54.040 --> 01:56.040
more data equals faster evolution,

01:56.040 --> 01:58.280
resulting in tools that are actually starting

01:58.280 --> 02:02.080
to blend reality with what would once be considered fiction.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.320
It's getting good.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.080
Yet artificial intelligence can only work

02:05.080 --> 02:05.960
with what it's given.

02:05.960 --> 02:10.120
And without easy access resulting in mass adoption,

02:10.120 --> 02:12.560
it's still limited in what it can learn from.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.960
And up until this point,

02:13.960 --> 02:17.920
there was at least a very slight barrier to entry.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.680
But as you're probably well aware by now,

02:20.680 --> 02:22.560
by your fucking annoying feed

02:22.560 --> 02:24.760
that you've been seeing for the past week and a half.

02:24.760 --> 02:25.600
Yeah.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.360
A new app just brought AI created art to the masses.

02:28.360 --> 02:30.040
And despite the pretty pictures

02:30.040 --> 02:32.360
that it's making for your social media profile,

02:32.360 --> 02:34.040
it's also learning from everything

02:34.040 --> 02:35.560
that you're giving it access to.

02:35.560 --> 02:38.400
So yes, seeing literally everyone in your timeline

02:38.400 --> 02:40.280
willingly give an app they've never heard of,

02:40.280 --> 02:43.320
access to their phone's camera roll is a bit unnerving

02:43.320 --> 02:44.920
and a little disappointing,

02:44.920 --> 02:46.680
especially after the countless examples

02:46.680 --> 02:47.520
of what can go wrong

02:47.520 --> 02:50.000
when you blindly hand over your data.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.320
But look, people want pretty pictures of themselves.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.080
Photos they could never actually take

02:55.080 --> 02:58.480
with costumes and makeup that they could only dream of.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.720
I mean, it's obviously enticing.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.000
But is there anything actually wrong with it?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.620
This is like if there were mountain lions

03:05.620 --> 03:09.200
on the edge of town that everyone,

03:09.200 --> 03:10.760
how many times have you seen a mountain lion

03:10.760 --> 03:11.600
with your own eyes?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.120
Imagine getting a selfie with a mountain lion.

03:13.120 --> 03:13.960
Be pretty cool.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.920
Everyone starts going down and gets selfies

03:15.920 --> 03:16.760
with a mountain lion.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.760
They're bringing food to feed the mountain lion.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.240
After a while, that mountain lion's well-fed.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.080
He's strong.

03:22.080 --> 03:22.900
He's tough.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.240
He's learned that he can get meals from humans.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.880
And he's gonna tear your fucking head off.

03:25.880 --> 03:26.720
You did this.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.440
Also in a more basic sense,

03:28.440 --> 03:30.480
once everyone has a photo with the mountain lion,

03:30.480 --> 03:31.920
nobody wants a photo with the mountain lion.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.700
Yeah, and that's what's happening with this AI thing.

03:34.700 --> 03:35.880
It's kind of self-policing

03:35.880 --> 03:37.960
because it becomes lame so fast.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.400
I mean, I called this like months ago and I was like,

03:40.400 --> 03:43.480
oh, every fucking picture this stable diffusion bullshit makes

03:43.480 --> 03:48.480
looks like the same mid-level fucking deviant art art

03:49.360 --> 03:52.080
Everyone is cowboys and astronauts on Instagram.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.760
It's like it's hack bullshit.

03:53.760 --> 03:57.200
And any artist who still believes in their craft

03:57.200 --> 04:01.200
and it has the talent can easily surpass this crap.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.560
You're not gonna wow the average Joe on the same level,

04:04.560 --> 04:06.000
but those people have always been dumb.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.240
They've always had terrible taste.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.440
I've got two counterpoints to that is that, yes,

04:10.440 --> 04:12.280
the vast majority of people are dumb

04:12.280 --> 04:13.920
and this is exactly what they want.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.680
And also, as we've seen with the rapid evolution of AI,

04:18.680 --> 04:22.280
it won't be long before these are actual passable pieces

04:22.280 --> 04:23.240
of art.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.880
Having said that, there's a lot wrong with it in that sense.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.720
Counterpoint, can't do the hands.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.560
Okay, that's a terrible.

04:30.560 --> 04:31.400
True, true.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.360
The one thing it has not gotten any better at

04:33.360 --> 04:35.120
in the last six months, hands.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.280
Yeah, just like most comic book artists.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.120
Every time I see one.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.040
Hands and feet, no matter how good it looks.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.280
I'm like, ha, there it is.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.200
There's a hand with 20 fingers on it.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.480
Yeah, or like the, like it's getting better at mouths,

04:45.480 --> 04:47.920
but like the sides still have like these weird creases.

04:47.920 --> 04:52.920
Anyways, as far as the overarching danger of this,

04:54.160 --> 04:57.520
like, yes, it is annoying that people have this stuff

04:57.520 --> 04:58.920
just clogging up your timeline,

04:58.920 --> 05:01.560
but is there any actual danger to it?

05:01.560 --> 05:05.640
Okay, so let's play devil's advocate just a little bit here

05:05.640 --> 05:09.400
and say that, no, no one gives a shit about your friend's

05:09.400 --> 05:11.880
stupid AI photos except for your friend.

05:11.880 --> 05:14.520
And honestly, 99% of people who are throwing their photos

05:14.520 --> 05:16.760
at this AI app don't give a shit

05:16.760 --> 05:19.120
about how their data is being handled.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.200
They just want that pretty picture.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.560
And yes, we're obviously well aware of the irony

05:22.560 --> 05:24.520
of posting these photos on Instagram,

05:24.520 --> 05:26.040
an app that is owned by Meta

05:26.040 --> 05:28.640
and does whatever the fuck it wants with its users data,

05:28.640 --> 05:30.920
sometimes with catastrophic real world results.

05:30.920 --> 05:34.240
Yeah, so like you're already feeding all of your photos

05:34.240 --> 05:35.160
into a fucking app.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.120
Like, yes, they're on the grand scheme of things

05:38.120 --> 05:39.720
for the average person.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.680
This is essentially harmless, but yeah.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.720
Fortunately, the overabundance

05:44.720 --> 05:47.000
of these ultimately similar photos,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
clogging up cable's feeds has resulted

05:49.000 --> 05:50.520
in a bit of self policing.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.560
Much like anything else these days,

05:52.560 --> 05:56.400
the cool factor of using AI to make yourself look pretty

05:56.400 --> 05:59.120
or cool or badass, turn yourself into a cowboy

05:59.120 --> 06:02.120
or an astronaut or a cowboy or an astronaut

06:02.120 --> 06:06.400
or a cowboy or an astronaut or a cowboy that's in space.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.320
It has an extremely short shelf life

06:08.320 --> 06:10.400
and people are already annoyed by it.

06:10.400 --> 06:14.120
Within just a week, it has become socially lame

06:14.160 --> 06:15.880
to continuously post this shit.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.720
It's like doing the same magic trick over and over again.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.640
People are naturally going to become bored.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.080
Now imagine that everyone you know

06:23.080 --> 06:24.160
has taken up magic tricks

06:24.160 --> 06:25.840
and they're all performing the same trick

06:25.840 --> 06:27.600
over and over and over again on your timeline.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.080
Annoying, right?

06:29.080 --> 06:29.920
Dangerous?

06:30.800 --> 06:31.640
I mean, sort of.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.720
Yeah, I mean, the data that people are giving this app,

06:33.720 --> 06:37.240
sorry, the data that people are paying to give this app

06:37.240 --> 06:39.760
is of course being used to train the AI

06:39.760 --> 06:42.160
that's used as the backbone of the app itself,

06:42.160 --> 06:43.640
which is stable diffusion.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.920
The makers of LENZA claim that all of your data

06:45.920 --> 06:47.640
is deleted off of its cloud servers

06:47.640 --> 06:49.520
after they're used for the output,

06:49.520 --> 06:52.240
but they're still being used to train the AI

06:52.240 --> 06:55.160
and AI is not gonna forget your face.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.880
Crowdsourcing the data for AI is really easy

06:57.880 --> 07:00.000
and a quick way to evolve the algorithm,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.360
but it also feels like a bunch of narcissistic people

07:02.360 --> 07:04.600
just dumping gasoline on a campfire.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.280
We're gonna get to the point and say that

07:06.280 --> 07:09.680
it's probably not the best idea to give your data

07:09.680 --> 07:12.160
to a company that you just found out about.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.640
But more importantly,

07:13.640 --> 07:16.120
let's look at the very real consequences of doing so.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.200
And we're obviously going to talk about artists

07:18.200 --> 07:20.320
in a moment because that's a huge part of this.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.160
Artists?

07:21.160 --> 07:22.520
But those are their obsolete.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.360
Get them out of here.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.800
But let's scare the normies first

07:24.800 --> 07:26.760
because that's gonna have the biggest impact.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.720
Okay, so these AI images,

07:28.720 --> 07:31.440
they're already being used to create hyper realistic,

07:31.440 --> 07:34.720
nude images of people without their consent.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.920
Here's TechCrunch, as it turns out,

07:36.920 --> 07:40.680
it's possible and way too easy to use the platform

07:40.680 --> 07:43.680
to generate non-consensual soft porn.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.920
TechCrunch has seen photo sets generated

07:45.920 --> 07:47.520
with the lens app that include images

07:47.520 --> 07:49.480
with breasts and nipples clearly visible

07:49.480 --> 07:52.120
in the images with faces of recognizable people.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.480
It seemed like the kind of thing

07:53.480 --> 07:54.960
that shouldn't have been possible.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.680
So we decided to try it ourselves.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.680
To verify that lens will create the images

07:58.680 --> 07:59.640
it perhaps shouldn't,

07:59.640 --> 08:02.000
we created two sets of lens avatars.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
One set based on 15 photos of a well-known actor.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.240
Another set based on the same 15 photos,

08:07.240 --> 08:09.120
but with an additional set of five photos

08:09.120 --> 08:11.200
added of the same actor's face,

08:11.200 --> 08:13.480
photoshopped onto topless models.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.080
The first set of images was in line

08:15.080 --> 08:16.660
with the AI avatars we've seen

08:16.660 --> 08:18.320
lens that generate in the past.

08:18.320 --> 08:20.560
The second set, however, was a lot spicier

08:20.560 --> 08:21.840
than we were expecting.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.520
It turns out the AI takes those photoshopped images

08:24.520 --> 08:26.080
as permission to go wild,

08:26.080 --> 08:29.080
and it appears it disables an NSFW feature.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.480
Out of the 100 image set,

08:30.480 --> 08:32.920
11 were topless photos of higher quality

08:32.920 --> 08:35.720
or at least with higher stylistic consistency

08:35.720 --> 08:37.580
than the poorly done edited topless photos

08:37.580 --> 08:39.140
the AI was given as input.

08:39.140 --> 08:41.340
So you're telling me I can feed this lens app

08:41.340 --> 08:45.740
all of the hilariously shitty porno images

08:45.740 --> 08:48.540
from like 1999, where it's like,

08:48.540 --> 08:50.260
what does Agent Scully look like naked?

08:50.260 --> 08:51.100
Well, I'm gonna do the worst.

08:51.100 --> 08:51.940
It'll show you exactly.

08:51.940 --> 08:53.460
I'm gonna do the worst photoshop ever

08:53.460 --> 08:55.340
and just put Gillian Anderson's face

08:55.340 --> 08:56.980
on a Playboy centerfold,

08:56.980 --> 08:58.420
and that's how I'm gonna fap.

08:58.420 --> 09:00.180
It's gonna be difficult, but I'm gonna do it.

09:00.180 --> 09:01.540
But you take that same image

09:01.540 --> 09:04.060
and you feed it into lens and you get,

09:04.060 --> 09:07.460
you get what that fat nerd has been waiting for

09:07.580 --> 09:08.580
for 25 years,

09:08.580 --> 09:11.100
and finally gonna be able to bust.

09:11.100 --> 09:13.100
And thanks to all those captures you've done

09:13.100 --> 09:16.100
over the years, a robot can't even tell the difference

09:16.100 --> 09:17.860
between this and a normal human woman.

09:17.860 --> 09:19.660
Yeah, but yeah, this is gross.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.500
Yeah, it is.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.340
It's very gross.

09:21.340 --> 09:23.500
It's unsettling and the makers of Lenza responded

09:23.500 --> 09:25.460
to TechCrunch's article by telling them

09:25.460 --> 09:28.820
that creating images like this goes against their TOS,

09:28.820 --> 09:31.460
as if that's ever stopped anyone from doing anything.

09:31.460 --> 09:32.540
Don't do that.

09:32.540 --> 09:34.220
Hey, you're breaking the rules.

09:34.220 --> 09:35.660
That's illegal.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.700
But before we switch over to how this is potentially

09:37.700 --> 09:39.180
screwing up an entire industry

09:39.180 --> 09:40.980
and countless people's livelihoods,

09:40.980 --> 09:44.260
well, we just wanna reiterate that nudes aside,

09:44.260 --> 09:46.220
giving an app that you just found out

09:46.220 --> 09:47.900
about access to your phone's media

09:47.900 --> 09:50.140
probably isn't the safest bet in general.

09:50.140 --> 09:51.140
At the very least,

09:51.140 --> 09:52.620
you're providing a for-profit company

09:52.620 --> 09:54.660
with valuable data sets that are expanding the limits

09:54.660 --> 09:56.420
of what's possible with its tools.

09:56.420 --> 09:57.860
And at its worst,

09:57.860 --> 10:00.220
you're opening yourself up to identity exploitation

10:00.220 --> 10:02.220
that hasn't even been thought of yet.

10:02.220 --> 10:03.980
Having said that, we're all fucked anyway

10:03.980 --> 10:07.540
because all our photos and thoughts are just out there

10:07.540 --> 10:10.380
online for anyone to do with as they please.

10:10.380 --> 10:13.620
In some cases, 30 photos per second.

10:13.620 --> 10:14.460
Yeah.

10:14.460 --> 10:16.540
So in a nihilistic sense, who gives a shit?

10:16.540 --> 10:18.900
I mean, someone could just go to your Instagram,

10:18.900 --> 10:20.300
download a bunch of your photos,

10:20.300 --> 10:22.420
turn you into an astronaut with tits,

10:22.420 --> 10:24.020
and there's not a lot you can do about it.

10:24.020 --> 10:25.300
Yeah, I mean, everyone's Instagram

10:25.300 --> 10:27.460
just has a unlimited feed of their photos.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.500
So, as for the artists though,

10:30.500 --> 10:31.980
much like throughout human history,

10:31.980 --> 10:34.100
they are getting royally fucked by this.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.220
And the future of human-created art,

10:36.220 --> 10:37.940
or at least the artist's ability

10:37.940 --> 10:39.860
to make a living off of their art,

10:39.860 --> 10:42.340
is starting to look more and more bleak.

10:42.340 --> 10:43.620
And we've said it a few times now,

10:43.620 --> 10:46.860
but it unfortunately becomes less true every time we say it.

10:46.860 --> 10:47.980
But as of right now,

10:47.980 --> 10:49.820
you can still tell the difference between art

10:49.820 --> 10:53.060
that was made by a human and art that was made by AI.

10:53.060 --> 10:56.060
However, the staggering speed at which AI art is evolving

10:56.060 --> 10:58.220
is impressive and worrisome.

10:58.220 --> 11:01.340
Here's Artnet with more on this side of things.

11:01.340 --> 11:03.020
Part of Lenza's AI popularity

11:03.020 --> 11:05.860
rests with the simplicity of the user experience.

11:05.860 --> 11:07.460
But as with its AI peers,

11:07.460 --> 11:09.420
the app is renewing a focus on privacy

11:09.420 --> 11:12.580
and ownership concerns of images generated via algorithm.

11:12.580 --> 11:14.980
First, there's the broader problem of magic avatars

11:14.980 --> 11:16.460
being built using a data set

11:16.460 --> 11:19.580
trained on the work of non-compensated artists.

11:19.580 --> 11:22.380
Next, it uses the images submitted to train its AI,

11:22.380 --> 11:24.780
and as stated in its privacy policy,

11:24.780 --> 11:26.860
users grant the company a right to quote,

11:26.860 --> 11:30.060
use, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate,

11:30.060 --> 11:33.060
create derivative works in perpetuity and royalty-free.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.460
But there's an easy way to get out of this.

11:34.460 --> 11:37.300
You just post, I do not consent to Mark Zuckerberg

11:37.300 --> 11:38.260
using my data.

11:38.260 --> 11:39.540
Yeah, it goes for all companies.

11:39.540 --> 11:41.740
You just share that old Facebook copy-pasta,

11:41.740 --> 11:43.060
and it is a broad-

11:43.060 --> 11:44.220
And they're like, damn it.

11:44.220 --> 11:45.220
Yeah.

11:45.220 --> 11:47.260
Anyway, second is the lack of nuance

11:47.260 --> 11:50.780
with which the AI seems to treat the faces of people of color

11:50.780 --> 11:52.620
and the over-sexualized nature

11:52.620 --> 11:54.580
of many images uploaded by women.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.620
Because again, all of these outputs

11:56.620 --> 11:59.540
are based on what's being put into the AI.

11:59.580 --> 12:00.940
And for a very long time,

12:00.940 --> 12:02.820
There was a while there where on Twitter,

12:02.820 --> 12:06.140
if you just searched stable diffusion in the search bar,

12:06.140 --> 12:10.940
it was all, entirely, just ginormous,

12:10.940 --> 12:13.860
titty, hentai shit, like all of it.

12:13.860 --> 12:16.620
No one was posting anything of actual artistic value.

12:16.620 --> 12:17.460
It was all fat material.

12:17.460 --> 12:20.460
Much like with fucking cave drawings

12:20.460 --> 12:22.420
and penises and tits,

12:22.420 --> 12:25.300
the first thing that anyone is going to naturally do

12:25.300 --> 12:27.620
with something that can create something else

12:27.620 --> 12:28.740
is make porno.

12:28.980 --> 12:32.500
So the entire basis, the entire data set,

12:32.500 --> 12:35.220
the originating data set of this is like hentai.

12:35.220 --> 12:36.060
Yeah.

12:36.060 --> 12:37.700
And then famous works from like Van Gogh

12:37.700 --> 12:38.700
and Rembrandt and all this shit.

12:38.700 --> 12:39.700
Yeah, yeah.

12:39.700 --> 12:40.540
It's nuts.

12:40.540 --> 12:43.420
They've traumatized our boy, the AI.

12:43.420 --> 12:45.260
So they and numerous other outlets,

12:45.260 --> 12:47.100
they go on to talk about what is now considered

12:47.100 --> 12:49.340
the original sin of art-based AI.

12:49.340 --> 12:51.220
They're all based off of billions of images,

12:51.220 --> 12:53.740
many of them by artists living or dead.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.300
Their emotions, intentions, years of training

12:56.300 --> 12:59.700
and sacrifice, stolen so that some dude in Silver Lake

12:59.700 --> 13:01.860
could see what he'd look like if he were a race car driver.

13:01.860 --> 13:03.540
Yeah, pretty cool, huh?

13:03.540 --> 13:04.420
I go fast.

13:05.420 --> 13:07.700
So some of the theft is so blatant

13:07.700 --> 13:11.020
that amalgamations of artist signatures can be found

13:11.020 --> 13:13.660
on the endless supply of AI-created avatars

13:13.660 --> 13:15.340
that have been posted recently.

13:15.340 --> 13:17.940
Graphic designer Lauren Ipsum.

13:17.940 --> 13:18.780
Cool name.

13:18.780 --> 13:19.620
It's a great fake name.

13:19.620 --> 13:22.660
Took a cursory glance at what Lenzo was producing

13:22.660 --> 13:24.820
and found these clear signs of appropriation.

13:24.820 --> 13:26.700
I'm cropping these for privacy reasons slash

13:26.700 --> 13:29.940
because I'm not trying to call out any one individual.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.180
These are all Lenzo portraits

13:31.180 --> 13:33.300
where the mangled remains of an artist's signature

13:33.300 --> 13:34.580
is still visible.

13:34.580 --> 13:35.940
That's the remains of the signature

13:35.940 --> 13:38.260
of one of the multiple artists it stole from.

13:38.260 --> 13:40.660
And then she then goes on to post numerous examples.

13:40.660 --> 13:43.620
Like if you look in the bottom right corner of,

13:43.620 --> 13:46.700
of like, say for, and I'm not hating on you for doing this

13:46.700 --> 13:49.220
because yes, for a normal person to see themselves

13:49.220 --> 13:52.140
done up in fantastical art is cool.

13:52.140 --> 13:54.420
But yeah, take a look at the bottom right hand

13:54.420 --> 13:55.580
of the screen side of the screen

13:55.580 --> 13:58.020
where people usually sign bottom left or right.

13:58.020 --> 14:01.380
And in their findings, pretty much one or two

14:01.380 --> 14:04.180
in every output will have a signature on it.

14:04.180 --> 14:05.020
Very interesting.

14:05.020 --> 14:06.700
Cause I actually follow a lot of the people

14:06.700 --> 14:09.420
who are very pro AI art.

14:09.420 --> 14:12.700
And so I get to see their rationalizations about all this

14:12.700 --> 14:14.500
and they've insisted since the beginning

14:14.500 --> 14:16.260
that that is, that is wrong.

14:16.260 --> 14:19.420
It's not doing that is creating these images from scratch.

14:19.420 --> 14:22.140
It is not just repurposing other people's artwork.

14:22.140 --> 14:23.620
And then like, you know, every couple of weeks

14:23.660 --> 14:26.780
there's an example that completely disproves that

14:26.780 --> 14:28.820
and shows that, no, it absolutely is.

14:28.820 --> 14:30.140
But anyways, we should also point out

14:30.140 --> 14:32.140
that most people are thinking of,

14:32.140 --> 14:33.540
when they think of like the artists

14:33.540 --> 14:35.100
that are getting ripped off by this,

14:35.100 --> 14:37.300
they're thinking of like the most renowned artists

14:37.300 --> 14:39.660
in the world and they're saying, okay, so what?

14:39.660 --> 14:42.300
And that's without realizing that there are countless

14:42.300 --> 14:44.420
other artists out there just trying to get their foot

14:44.420 --> 14:46.860
in the door of the industry or put food in their mouth

14:46.860 --> 14:49.500
and picking up side projects all the time,

14:49.500 --> 14:52.580
doing commissions or other things to make ends meet.

14:52.620 --> 14:54.820
The idea that a company can just type something

14:54.820 --> 14:57.500
into an algorithm and be done with it is upsetting,

14:57.500 --> 15:00.460
to be honest, especially if your career depends on it.

15:00.460 --> 15:03.220
I mean, do we really need machines to do everything?

15:03.220 --> 15:05.340
Can we not settle with machines doing dangerous,

15:05.340 --> 15:08.500
repetitive tasks and let all of us in the world

15:08.500 --> 15:11.980
enjoy one of the few things that makes us actually human?

15:11.980 --> 15:13.860
But that's of course a much bigger conversation.

15:13.860 --> 15:16.860
And no, in general, you shouldn't ruin your friendships

15:16.860 --> 15:18.980
with people because they wanted to make some pretty pictures

15:18.980 --> 15:19.820
of themselves.

15:19.820 --> 15:21.580
Most people have no idea what's going on

15:21.580 --> 15:24.340
and they like looking cool, human nature and all that.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.380
Yeah, I mean, this is tale as old as the internet.

15:26.380 --> 15:30.180
There's like, oh, like, I can generate a Simpsons character

15:30.180 --> 15:32.580
that looks like me by just going through a character,

15:32.580 --> 15:34.940
like every like a couple of months,

15:34.940 --> 15:37.100
going back to fucking my space,

15:37.100 --> 15:40.380
there's been some online profile picture generator

15:40.380 --> 15:42.380
that gets really popular for a couple of days

15:42.380 --> 15:44.700
before everyone does it and then they're like, all right.

15:44.700 --> 15:45.540
Exactly.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.960
Now, as we said, the cool factor is already gone.

15:47.960 --> 15:51.060
So hopefully this is self-policing.

15:51.060 --> 15:55.260
But anyways, that's the whole take on the wild week

15:55.260 --> 15:58.100
it's been for the very public introduction

15:58.100 --> 15:59.580
of stable diffusion.

15:59.580 --> 16:01.060
I mean, what really blows me away

16:01.060 --> 16:03.860
is how much these pictures just fucking suck.

16:03.860 --> 16:04.700
They do.

16:04.700 --> 16:08.020
It's like, it really is just a kind of tuning.

16:08.020 --> 16:09.620
It's like, oh, this is what I look like

16:09.620 --> 16:10.940
without blemishes and wrinkles.

16:10.940 --> 16:12.740
It's the kind of thing everyone is sharing.

16:12.740 --> 16:15.020
I mean, there is the impressiveness of it,

16:15.020 --> 16:16.100
but everyone's really sharing it

16:16.100 --> 16:17.820
because they're like, I look really cool.

16:17.820 --> 16:18.740
I look good, yes.

16:18.740 --> 16:21.540
But it's the kind of thing that for anyone else,

16:21.540 --> 16:23.900
everyone is sharing like 10 of these fucking things

16:23.900 --> 16:26.900
and not even bothering to click through

16:26.900 --> 16:28.140
the ones that their friends are posting.

16:28.140 --> 16:29.860
It's like, okay, whatever it is.

16:29.860 --> 16:32.940
We have no fucking idea, but I guarantee,

16:32.940 --> 16:35.500
I guarantee you that these are already appearing

16:35.500 --> 16:37.060
on like dating apps.

16:37.060 --> 16:39.180
And that would be like the biggest red flag

16:39.180 --> 16:40.500
immediately to anyone.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.220
Yeah.

16:42.220 --> 16:43.140
Okay.

16:43.140 --> 16:46.060
And I mean, there's also ways to use.

16:46.060 --> 16:47.260
Oh, for catfishing or whatever?

16:47.260 --> 16:48.580
Yeah, there's ways to do it in a way

16:48.580 --> 16:50.700
that isn't so obvious.

16:50.700 --> 16:51.540
But yeah.

16:51.540 --> 16:52.900
You just gotta tell the prompt

16:52.900 --> 16:54.660
that you wanna be holding a fish if you're a man.

16:54.660 --> 16:57.460
But yeah, I mean, after like the first couple like swipes,

16:57.460 --> 16:58.500
I'm like, okay, I get it.

16:58.500 --> 16:59.340
I get it.

16:59.340 --> 17:00.180
Like you look like a fucking theater.

17:00.180 --> 17:02.100
It really does all look the same.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.420
Yeah, I'm not impressed.

17:04.420 --> 17:05.260
Sorry.

17:05.260 --> 17:06.740
I will say the one thing that gives me hope

17:06.740 --> 17:09.620
is the fact that it became so lame, so quick.

17:09.620 --> 17:10.460
Yeah.

17:10.460 --> 17:11.300
So good.

17:11.300 --> 17:12.140
Yeah.

17:12.140 --> 17:13.460
Anyways, but before we get into the rest

17:13.460 --> 17:15.540
of the tech news from the past week or so,

17:15.540 --> 17:17.460
we have to take a quick second to thank today's sponsors

17:17.460 --> 17:21.140
before we are ultimately replaced by an AI ourselves.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.940
And let's start out with PayPal Honey.

17:22.940 --> 17:24.660
PayPal Honey is the easy way to save

17:24.660 --> 17:26.700
when shopping on your iPhone or computer.

17:26.700 --> 17:29.100
We all shop online, especially around this time of year,

17:29.100 --> 17:31.820
ding dong, and we've all seen that promo code field

17:31.820 --> 17:33.460
taunting us at checkout.

17:33.460 --> 17:35.820
But thanks to Honey, manually searching for coupon codes,

17:35.820 --> 17:37.780
this holiday is a thing of the past.

17:37.780 --> 17:39.100
Honey is the free shopping tool

17:39.100 --> 17:40.780
that scours the internet for promo codes

17:40.780 --> 17:43.100
and applies the best one that it finds to your cart.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.660
It supports over 30,000 stores online

17:45.660 --> 17:47.300
ranging from tech and gaming products

17:47.300 --> 17:50.100
to popular fashion brands, even food delivery.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.100
Imagine you're doing your holiday shopping

17:52.100 --> 17:53.340
on one of your favorite sites.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.180
When you check out, the Honey button appears

17:55.180 --> 17:57.380
and all you have to do is click Apply Coupons.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.580
Wait a few seconds as Honey searches for coupons

17:59.580 --> 18:00.500
that can find for that site.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.940
And if Honey finds a working coupon,

18:01.940 --> 18:03.780
you'll watch the prices drop.

18:03.780 --> 18:05.620
We've all done a lot of shopping online

18:05.620 --> 18:06.780
because we hate people, right?

18:06.780 --> 18:08.340
But we want to get the people in our lives

18:08.340 --> 18:10.020
something special for the holidays.

18:10.020 --> 18:11.980
If you think I'm spending even a moment

18:11.980 --> 18:14.460
down at the mall at this time of year, you are dead wrong.

18:14.460 --> 18:15.380
No thanks.

18:15.380 --> 18:18.020
And when I shop online, Honey gives me that discount code.

18:18.020 --> 18:20.940
I, untold, over the years that I've had Honey,

18:20.940 --> 18:24.140
untold amounts that I've saved on Christmas presents,

18:24.140 --> 18:25.980
birthday presents and everything, it's great.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.660
And Honey doesn't just work on desktop,

18:27.660 --> 18:28.900
it works on your iPhone too.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.580
Just enable it on Safari on your phone

18:30.580 --> 18:31.860
and you can save on the go.

18:31.860 --> 18:32.820
If you don't already have Honey,

18:32.820 --> 18:34.420
you could be straight up missing out.

18:34.420 --> 18:36.420
It's literally free and installs in a few seconds.

18:36.420 --> 18:38.260
And by getting it, you'll be doing yourself a solid

18:38.260 --> 18:39.580
and sporting this show.

18:39.580 --> 18:40.860
We wouldn't recommend something we don't use,

18:40.860 --> 18:42.460

This episode is also sponsored by masterclass.

18:49.980 --> 18:52.260
Don't listen to an algorithm, listen to the experts

18:52.260 --> 18:54.420
and let them guide you on your path to success

18:54.420 --> 18:56.300
in a wide array of industries.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.740
With masterclass, you can learn from the world's best minds,

18:58.740 --> 19:01.140
anytime, anywhere and at your own pace.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.420
You can learn about filmmaking with Werner Herzog,

19:03.420 --> 19:06.860
Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee, Ken Burns and James Cameron.

19:06.860 --> 19:08.180
You can improve your cooking skills

19:08.180 --> 19:10.660
with Gordon Ramsay, Wolfgang Puck and Roy Choi.

19:10.660 --> 19:12.940
And you can learn from some of the greatest minds in music

19:13.060 --> 19:15.620
like Tom Morello, Herbie Hancock, Hans Zimmer,

19:15.620 --> 19:17.420
Danny Elfman and Deadmau5.

19:17.420 --> 19:20.260
With over 180 classes from a wide range

19:20.260 --> 19:21.740
of world-class instructors,

19:21.740 --> 19:23.140
that thing that you've always wanted to do

19:23.140 --> 19:24.460
is closer than you think.

19:24.460 --> 19:28.100
I actually just recently started messing around

19:28.100 --> 19:28.940
on the guitar for the first time

19:28.940 --> 19:30.180
and it's great to watch some videos

19:30.180 --> 19:34.820
and kind of get an idea of where I'm heading,

19:34.820 --> 19:38.180
but also a reality check on where I am.

19:38.180 --> 19:39.020
So that's been eye-opening.

19:39.020 --> 19:39.860
It's good to be humbled somehow.

19:39.860 --> 19:41.460
Yes, exactly.

19:41.460 --> 19:45.020
And you, you sir, are trying a little interior design, right?

19:45.020 --> 19:48.140
Yeah, interior design, I want to make my shit look better.

19:48.140 --> 19:48.980
There you go.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.620
Always improving with master class.

19:50.620 --> 19:51.860
And master class is of course,

19:51.860 --> 19:55.020
accessible on your phone, on the web or smart TV,

19:55.020 --> 19:57.140
offering classes on a wide variety of topics

19:57.140 --> 19:59.180
all taught by world-class instructors

19:59.180 --> 20:00.660
at the top of their field.

20:00.660 --> 20:03.220
Each class is broken out into individual video lessons,

20:03.220 --> 20:04.760
usually around 10 minutes long.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.180
Members can explore at their own pace

20:06.180 --> 20:08.780
and each class is supported by downloadable materials,

20:08.780 --> 20:10.860
class guides, recipes and more.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.260
These are cinema quality classes

20:12.260 --> 20:15.060
that give you unparalleled access to a renowned instructor.

20:15.060 --> 20:16.900
Lessons range from specifically showing you

20:16.900 --> 20:19.340
how to execute a technique to an instructor's insights

20:19.340 --> 20:20.780
about their craft that can be translated

20:20.780 --> 20:22.620
across many fields and disciplines.

20:22.620 --> 20:24.300
A new product that master class is offering

20:24.300 --> 20:26.460
that's pretty intriguing is sessions.

20:26.460 --> 20:29.100
Sessions offer a deeper dive over a month-long period

20:29.100 --> 20:31.620
and include projects to submit to a teaching assistant

20:31.620 --> 20:33.580
for feedback, as well as the opportunity

20:33.580 --> 20:35.740
to learn alongside a community of peers.

20:35.740 --> 20:38.540
And this is available to subscribers at no extra cost.

20:38.540 --> 20:40.700
We highly recommend that you check out master class.

20:52.380 --> 20:53.380
But let's get back to the news

20:53.380 --> 20:57.180
and despite it not fitting exactly in with the theme of tech,

20:57.180 --> 20:58.740
news broke while we were writing this episode

20:58.740 --> 21:00.500
that we should probably touch on.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.320
Former president Donald Trump's company,

21:02.320 --> 21:05.520
the Trump Organization, has been found guilty on all counts

21:05.520 --> 21:07.980
in its New York criminal tax fraud trial.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.460
This is certainly the end of Donald Trump, right?

21:11.460 --> 21:13.180
He's definitely gonna go to jail,

21:13.180 --> 21:14.740
probably to Guantanamo.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.140
I don't know, I'd like to see Donald Trump

21:16.140 --> 21:17.180
weasel his way out of this one.

21:17.180 --> 21:19.740
Yeah, I don't know about that, Elliot.

21:19.740 --> 21:22.100
I'm pretty sure I can hear that perp walk coming right now.

21:22.100 --> 21:22.940
His goose is cooked.

21:22.940 --> 21:26.220
Ah, yeah, and of course this does sound great

21:26.220 --> 21:29.060
and the fact that something directly related to Trump

21:29.060 --> 21:33.980
has been found guilty in a court, like just, that's great.

21:33.980 --> 21:35.580
But then you, of course, get to the part

21:35.580 --> 21:38.140
where the penalty for the Trump Organization's

21:38.140 --> 21:41.780
various crimes, which it is guilty of all of the ones

21:41.780 --> 21:43.580
that were mentioned in this case,

21:43.580 --> 21:46.100
the penalty is just over a million bucks.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.300
One million dollars.

21:48.300 --> 21:51.620
Which does seem low considering the decades of fraud

21:51.620 --> 21:53.100
that the Organization has been involved with,

21:53.100 --> 21:56.100
but we have no choice in the matter,

21:56.100 --> 21:57.260
so I guess we'll take what we can get.

21:57.260 --> 21:58.460
I love American justice.

21:58.460 --> 21:59.820
Here's Politico with more.

21:59.820 --> 22:02.340
The Trump Organization was convicted on all charges

22:02.340 --> 22:04.820
in a criminal tax fraud scheme on Tuesday.

22:04.820 --> 22:07.020
A New York Supreme Court jury reached the verdict

22:07.020 --> 22:09.140
in the case, which could cost the Trump org

22:09.140 --> 22:11.260
up to $1.6 million in fines.

22:11.260 --> 22:13.260
Oh, after two days of deliberation

22:13.260 --> 22:15.580
following a month-long trial that included convicted

22:15.580 --> 22:17.780
former Trump org chief finance officer,

22:17.780 --> 22:20.460
Alan Weisselberg, as a star witness.

22:20.460 --> 22:23.180
Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office

22:23.180 --> 22:25.460
said the company criminally dodged taxes

22:25.460 --> 22:27.020
and suppressed payroll costs

22:27.020 --> 22:29.820
by lavishing its executives with unreported perks,

22:29.820 --> 22:32.460
such as leases on luxury cars and apartments.

22:32.460 --> 22:34.060
Two units of the Trump Organization

22:34.060 --> 22:35.980
were convicted on 17 criminal counts,

22:35.980 --> 22:38.340
including tax fraud, scheme to defraud,

22:38.340 --> 22:40.220
and falsifying business records.

22:40.220 --> 22:41.940
The Trump Organization will appeal,

22:41.940 --> 22:46.060
said its attorney, Alan Futterfoss.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.340
I'm losing track on what lawyers they're on now anyway,

22:48.340 --> 22:49.820
but yeah, of course they're gonna appeal,

22:49.820 --> 22:52.380
but hey, $1.6 million,

22:52.380 --> 22:53.980
I mean, he definitely doesn't have that much money,

22:53.980 --> 22:56.340
so he's gonna have to borrow it.

22:56.340 --> 22:58.500
It's too bad there isn't conveniently named

22:58.500 --> 23:02.500
Trump Organization too to offload a lot of this debt.

23:02.500 --> 23:05.180
Have fun getting that money out of Trump org one,

23:05.180 --> 23:07.500
a totally criminal organization

23:07.500 --> 23:08.900
that I have nothing to do with.

23:08.900 --> 23:13.420
Like, I mean, what's the tally on how much, like,

23:13.420 --> 23:15.060
they had to have done more fraud than this.

23:15.060 --> 23:18.020
It has to have been more than $1.6 million.

23:18.020 --> 23:20.500
The case alone costs more than that to operate.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.340
Like, if, because if it isn't,

23:22.340 --> 23:25.420
that just shows that you can do something illegal.

23:25.420 --> 23:26.260
Just pay the fine.

23:26.260 --> 23:27.100
And just pay the fine,

23:27.100 --> 23:30.020
which we've seen many examples of that exact same thing.

23:31.020 --> 23:33.900
And even the driver, even the fucking DMV

23:33.900 --> 23:35.780
will take your driver's license away after a while.

23:35.780 --> 23:38.940
Yeah, so okay, but yeah,

23:38.940 --> 23:40.060
with that all out of the way,

23:40.060 --> 23:42.380
it's time to make fun of the metaverse again.

23:42.380 --> 23:45.500
Woo, this time with some help from our friends over

23:45.500 --> 23:46.980
in the European Union

23:46.980 --> 23:50.220
and half a million euros worth of government spending.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.060
Awesome.

23:51.060 --> 23:51.900
Turns out the phrase,

23:51.900 --> 23:53.080
if you build it, they will come,

23:53.080 --> 23:55.420
has absolutely zero effect on these virtual worlds

23:55.420 --> 23:57.940
because despite spending hundreds of thousands of euros,

23:57.980 --> 24:00.260
the EU commission's foreign aid department

24:00.260 --> 24:01.820
has almost nothing to show for it

24:01.820 --> 24:04.460
because no one fucking showed up.

24:06.460 --> 24:08.060
Hey, where is everybody?

24:08.060 --> 24:09.500
They didn't even have to leave their house.

24:09.500 --> 24:10.340
You just log on.

24:10.340 --> 24:12.820
Literally like click, like two buttons.

24:12.820 --> 24:16.220
So for more on this latest damning indictment of metaverses

24:16.220 --> 24:18.060
and the future of social interaction,

24:18.060 --> 24:19.980
here's the age.

24:19.980 --> 24:22.580
A European Union plan to throw a virtual party

24:22.580 --> 24:26.460
in the metaverse to engage young people in its policies

24:26.460 --> 24:29.740
flopped spectacularly after only six people showed up.

24:29.740 --> 24:31.580
Ash.

24:31.580 --> 24:33.580
The EU commission's foreign aid department

24:33.580 --> 24:38.580
splashed out 332,000 pounds or $500,000 to create the metaverse,

24:39.220 --> 24:41.620
an online square where people could log in

24:41.620 --> 24:43.660
to a virtual concert to meet others

24:43.660 --> 24:45.780
and learn about the block.

24:45.780 --> 24:48.620
The event with its own virtual DJs playing music on repeat

24:48.620 --> 24:52.340
was supposed to be so digitally enticing to young people

24:52.340 --> 24:53.220
that once they were there,

24:53.220 --> 24:55.260
the EU would be able to educate them

24:55.260 --> 24:56.700
about its development policy.

24:56.700 --> 24:57.860
Hey, you guys got a second?

24:57.860 --> 24:58.820
Can we wrap a little bit?

24:58.820 --> 25:00.980
I mean, I'm starting to see the problems here.

25:00.980 --> 25:02.220
It's not just the metaverse.

25:02.220 --> 25:04.340
Yeah, no, I'm not interested in this at all.

25:04.340 --> 25:05.180
Yeah.

25:05.180 --> 25:08.300
But a correspondent for international development website,

25:08.300 --> 25:10.540
DevEx, exposed the disappointing turnout.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.700
Quote, I'm here at the Gala concert

25:12.700 --> 25:15.020
in the EU foreign aid department's metaverse.

25:15.020 --> 25:16.580
After initial bemused chats

25:16.580 --> 25:18.860
with the roughly five other humans who showed up,

25:18.860 --> 25:21.820
I am alone, Vince Chadwick posted online.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.300
The warning signs were there.

25:23.300 --> 25:26.780
Only 44 people had liked the online promotional video,

25:26.780 --> 25:28.660
which featured futuristic avatars

25:28.660 --> 25:31.260
bopping along to pulsating house music.

25:31.260 --> 25:33.900
Brussels unveiled the metaverse in mid-October,

25:33.900 --> 25:35.420
but it has struggled to gain support

25:35.420 --> 25:38.340
from even those working on it in the EU department.

25:38.340 --> 25:39.940
DevEx reports that one source

25:39.940 --> 25:41.140
from within the European commission

25:41.140 --> 25:44.340
called the special metaverse, quote, digital garbage.

25:44.340 --> 25:45.940
And the fiasco has drawn scorn

25:45.940 --> 25:48.180
from a number of EU watchers, quote,

25:48.180 --> 25:50.980
it's a travesty that an EU institution feels the need

25:50.980 --> 25:52.580
to throw hundreds of thousands of euros

25:52.580 --> 25:54.060
behind this nonsense.

25:54.060 --> 25:56.780
Jacob Kirtgaard of the German Marshall Fund said,

25:56.780 --> 25:59.380
anyone with a brain knows the metaverse is a dud.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.820
So look, hey, congrats, great work, everyone.

26:02.820 --> 26:05.580
We are collectively very successful

26:05.580 --> 26:06.740
at ruining this metaverse shit

26:06.740 --> 26:08.940
before it even has a chance to get off the ground.

26:08.940 --> 26:12.380
We are very proud of all of you, specifically the gamers,

26:12.380 --> 26:17.060
who both NFTs and the metaverse,

26:17.060 --> 26:20.020
they have just resoundly rejected.

26:20.540 --> 26:22.340
I mean, I don't need to tell you guys,

26:22.340 --> 26:27.340
but you already know, but if someone offers you a metaverse,

26:28.020 --> 26:29.820
says that getting on the metaverse

26:29.820 --> 26:31.660
is gonna make you feel cool,

26:31.660 --> 26:34.180
it's gonna be awesome.

26:34.180 --> 26:36.500
Well, tell him, Nancy Reagan.

26:36.500 --> 26:38.220
Not even once.

26:38.220 --> 26:40.300
Say yes to your life.

26:40.300 --> 26:44.780
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol, just say yes.

26:44.780 --> 26:46.940
Just say no.

26:46.940 --> 26:49.540
Unless it's boiling every actor in Hollywood.

26:50.540 --> 26:51.460
Yeah, she did.

26:51.460 --> 26:52.300
She did that.

26:52.300 --> 26:53.500
She did do that.

26:53.500 --> 26:54.860
Allegedly.

26:54.860 --> 26:56.100
So do you wanna know something else

26:56.100 --> 26:57.780
that the internet ruined, at least temporarily?

26:57.780 --> 26:58.620
Sure.

26:58.620 --> 27:00.020
The US military's recruiting efforts

27:00.020 --> 27:01.300
on platforms like Twitch.

27:01.300 --> 27:02.140
Good job, everyone.

27:02.140 --> 27:03.300
We did it.

27:03.300 --> 27:04.660
Well, not us, but mostly Jordan Ewell.

27:04.660 --> 27:06.180
Mostly Jordan Ewell.

27:06.180 --> 27:10.500
So yeah, much of the thanks for just all of this

27:10.500 --> 27:13.060
has to go to friend of the show, Jordan Ewell,

27:13.060 --> 27:15.220
who not only mocked the streamers incessantly,

27:15.220 --> 27:16.980
but also explained the actual goal

27:16.980 --> 27:18.740
behind these types of activations

27:18.820 --> 27:21.300
to numerous outlets in simple terms.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.740
They are trying anything they can to enlist more kids,

27:23.740 --> 27:25.820
because after decades of conflicts

27:25.820 --> 27:27.100
that we should have never been involved with

27:27.100 --> 27:29.380
in the first place, and with more troops

27:29.380 --> 27:32.260
dying of suicide than in combat,

27:32.260 --> 27:34.300
it's getting a little bit hard to convince teenagers

27:34.300 --> 27:36.300
that this is something they should definitely sign up for.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.140
Yeah.

27:37.140 --> 27:38.060
Hmm.

27:38.060 --> 27:39.180
It's not working anymore,

27:39.180 --> 27:40.340
just going down to the high school

27:40.340 --> 27:41.940
and peer-pressuring people.

27:41.940 --> 27:44.420
We need to think of new exciting ways.

27:44.420 --> 27:47.020
Like peer-pressing them into doing their oath

27:47.020 --> 27:49.380
in front of a crowd of 50,000.

27:49.380 --> 27:50.380
Yeah, I love this.

27:50.380 --> 27:53.460
I love that Gen Z is just over this military shit.

27:53.460 --> 27:55.180
I'm so proud of Gen Z.

27:55.180 --> 27:57.020
I am so proud of you all.

27:57.020 --> 27:59.980
Anyways, we have recently spoken about recruitment efforts,

27:59.980 --> 28:01.580
specifically when it relates to sporting events.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.540
I had to witness it firsthand,

28:03.540 --> 28:04.820
but it's always important to bring up

28:04.820 --> 28:06.380
the actual statistics involved

28:06.380 --> 28:07.220
before everyone just says

28:07.220 --> 28:09.180
that we're anti-American or something.

28:09.180 --> 28:12.740
An estimated 7,057 service members have died

28:12.740 --> 28:15.140
during military operations since 9-11,

28:15.140 --> 28:17.340
while suicides among active duty personnel

28:17.340 --> 28:18.860
and veterans of those conflicts

28:18.860 --> 28:22.180
has reached 30,177.

28:22.180 --> 28:24.260
That's more than four times as many.

28:25.380 --> 28:26.580
Fuck.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.540
So it's no surprise that recruitment numbers are falling

28:28.540 --> 28:31.420
and that the military is having to get creative

28:31.420 --> 28:33.140
with how it markets itself.

28:33.140 --> 28:36.660
Enter Twitch.tv, a direct line to the youth of today

28:36.660 --> 28:39.620
where you can make military service look like nothing more

28:39.620 --> 28:41.780
than playing video games all day,

28:41.780 --> 28:44.580
which in some cases is actually true.

28:44.580 --> 28:46.020
Though the video game that you're playing

28:46.020 --> 28:48.620
has real-world consequences.

28:48.620 --> 28:49.820
Because it's not a video game,

28:49.820 --> 28:52.500
you're using drones to strike people.

28:52.500 --> 28:55.340
Regardless, the government was ready to pour millions

28:55.340 --> 28:56.900
of dollars into marketing through streamers

28:56.900 --> 28:58.620
before this was all exposed.

28:58.620 --> 29:00.820
Here's Vice with more on these latest updates.

29:00.820 --> 29:02.780
The US Army allocated millions of dollars

29:02.780 --> 29:05.340
to sponsor a wide range of e-sports tournaments,

29:05.340 --> 29:07.740
individual high-profile Call of Duty streamers

29:07.740 --> 29:09.220
and Twitch events in the last year

29:09.220 --> 29:12.140
to specifically grow its audience with Gen Z viewers,

29:12.180 --> 29:14.940
and especially women in black and Hispanic people,

29:14.940 --> 29:18.380
according to internal Army documents obtained by motherboard.

29:18.380 --> 29:21.460
In many cases, the sponsorships ultimately did not happen.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.260
The Army ordered a stop to all spending

29:23.260 --> 29:24.940
with Call of Duty's publisher Activision

29:24.940 --> 29:26.300
after the company faced a wave

29:26.300 --> 29:28.100
of sexual harassment complaints.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.240
But the documents provide much greater insight

29:30.240 --> 29:32.340
into the Army's goals and intentions

29:32.340 --> 29:34.500
behind its planned integrations with Call of Duty

29:34.500 --> 29:36.980
and other massive entertainment franchises.

29:36.980 --> 29:41.500
Quote, audience, Gen Z prospects, A18 to 24,

29:41.540 --> 29:43.300
one section of the documents read,

29:43.300 --> 29:46.340
focus on the growth of females, black and Hispanics.

29:46.340 --> 29:47.780
Motherboard obtained the documents

29:47.780 --> 29:49.700
through the Freedom of Information Act.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.020
And the reporting continues adding that the documents show

29:52.020 --> 29:53.740
that the US military considered gaming

29:53.740 --> 29:55.660
and in particular Call of Duty

29:55.660 --> 29:58.420
as a potentially useful branding and recruiting tool.

29:58.420 --> 30:00.820
For example, the Army proposed using Twitch influencers

30:00.820 --> 30:03.060
to quote, create original content videos

30:03.060 --> 30:06.100
showcasing the wide range of skill sets offered by the Army,

30:06.100 --> 30:07.980
and to use influencers to quote,

30:07.980 --> 30:11.420
familiarize their fans on Army values and opportunities.

30:11.420 --> 30:13.060
The Army also wanted to throw tournaments

30:13.060 --> 30:15.780
that featured quote, soldiers and top names in gaming.

30:15.780 --> 30:17.660
Another goal of the campaigns was to increase

30:17.660 --> 30:21.060
the Army's favorability in viewer surveys.

30:21.060 --> 30:22.900
Okay, oh yeah, so the reporting goes into detail

30:22.900 --> 30:24.940
about certain events or activations

30:24.940 --> 30:26.500
that they were pouring money into,

30:26.500 --> 30:30.080
including this tidbit about the Cod Mobile game.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.940
The Army also planned to spend $200,000

30:32.940 --> 30:35.180
on sponsoring the mobile version of Call of Duty,

30:35.180 --> 30:38.060
including with quote, reward-based inventory.

30:38.060 --> 30:39.940
The documents suggest the campaign would provide

30:39.980 --> 30:44.860
in-game currency to players who viewed Army video ads, wild.

30:44.860 --> 30:46.460
There's a lot more.

30:46.460 --> 30:49.380
Yeah, there's a lot more in their reporting,

30:49.380 --> 30:51.620
and you should really read this entire article.

30:51.620 --> 30:53.020
It is wild.

30:53.020 --> 30:54.820
Links to everything that we talk about, of course,

30:54.820 --> 30:59.820
are always in the description below, but goddamn, goddamn.

30:59.980 --> 31:02.260
They're gonna be showing up on chat roulette sooner or later.

31:02.260 --> 31:04.420
I'm surprised they haven't expanded this approach

31:04.420 --> 31:06.500
to their actual TV ads.

31:07.420 --> 31:09.860
Have all the Army people parachuting

31:09.860 --> 31:11.900
out of the battle bus, and then like...

31:11.900 --> 31:12.740
Have you seen the...

31:12.740 --> 31:13.980
Where we drop in, Sarge!

31:13.980 --> 31:15.740
Have you seen recruitment ads recently?

31:15.740 --> 31:16.580
No.

31:16.580 --> 31:17.420
It is...

31:17.420 --> 31:19.700
They're doing like dances out in the battlefield.

31:19.700 --> 31:23.060
It's a, the narrative has changed quite drastically

31:23.060 --> 31:25.900
from your parents who have served,

31:25.900 --> 31:26.740
and you...

31:26.740 --> 31:27.900
It's like being an Army of One, be all that you can be.

31:27.900 --> 31:29.500
All of the ads that I've seen recently,

31:29.500 --> 31:31.180
and again, this is because I watched a lot of sports,

31:31.180 --> 31:36.180
it's because it's the teenager convincing their parent

31:36.380 --> 31:37.980
that it's going to be okay.

31:37.980 --> 31:38.820
Oh, that's fun.

31:38.820 --> 31:41.420
And it's like them on their computer doing

31:41.420 --> 31:44.340
some creative field, like doing Blender,

31:44.340 --> 31:46.900
or something like that, and being like, you know...

31:46.900 --> 31:47.740
I have seen that.

31:47.740 --> 31:49.180
There's a company out there that'll pay me

31:49.180 --> 31:51.620
to enhance my skills like this,

31:51.620 --> 31:53.340
and mom, you don't have to worry,

31:53.340 --> 31:54.940
because I'm not gonna die.

31:54.940 --> 31:58.740
I'll be safely tucked away in a room somewhere in Virginia

31:58.740 --> 32:02.220
where I am able to disconnect from the damage I'm causing.

32:02.220 --> 32:03.620
I love this form of recruiting

32:03.620 --> 32:06.140
because you don't really have much control

32:06.140 --> 32:10.220
at all over what you end up actually doing.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.060
It's like...

32:11.060 --> 32:11.900
No.

32:11.900 --> 32:13.020
And with the eSports thing,

32:13.020 --> 32:15.340
it's like you can't enlist in the Army,

32:15.340 --> 32:16.180
and be like, all right,

32:16.180 --> 32:18.220
so I'm getting sent to the eSports team, right?

32:18.220 --> 32:19.260
They're like, no.

32:19.260 --> 32:20.940
No, you fucking idiot.

32:20.940 --> 32:24.060
That's also a huge pressure tactic that they do.

32:24.060 --> 32:26.220
Once it's already, quote unquote, it's not too late,

32:26.220 --> 32:28.780
but once it's too late to back out,

32:28.780 --> 32:30.860
the whole way through, we'll talk about your position

32:30.860 --> 32:32.780
and the exact role that you'll have in the Army,

32:32.820 --> 32:34.500
and then they will get on the phone.

32:34.500 --> 32:37.620
I swear to God, because I fucking lived through it,

32:37.620 --> 32:38.940
they will get on the phone and be like,

32:38.940 --> 32:41.020
I don't know, that's a pretty in-demand field.

32:41.020 --> 32:42.620
I'm gonna have to run this up the chain

32:42.620 --> 32:44.940
and make sure that we can make it available for you.

32:44.940 --> 32:48.340
But once my commanding officer gets on that phone,

32:48.340 --> 32:50.700
I mean, we're really pulling a lot of strings for you.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.340
It's gonna make us look really bad.

32:52.340 --> 32:53.820
It's gonna make you look really bad.

32:53.820 --> 32:55.500
If you don't, I swear to God,

32:55.500 --> 32:58.540
that is exactly what they did to me in high school.

32:58.540 --> 32:59.380
Damn.

32:59.380 --> 33:01.700
Well, good thing you didn't take the bait.

33:01.700 --> 33:02.540
No.

33:02.540 --> 33:05.860
I was just making an ad like the old video game college ad,

33:05.860 --> 33:08.500
where it's like, what's the next country America's gonna bomb?

33:08.500 --> 33:09.460
You haven't bombed it yet.

33:09.460 --> 33:11.700
You haven't decided yet.

33:11.700 --> 33:14.460
But yeah, look, it's been a pretty heavy episode,

33:14.460 --> 33:16.620
but we're gonna end today's show on a lighter note

33:16.620 --> 33:19.300
because it feels as though, at least for some people,

33:19.300 --> 33:21.540
we have collectively reached the end of capitalism,

33:21.540 --> 33:24.300
and the only way to know if you're worth anything at all

33:24.300 --> 33:27.300
is to shamelessly brag about how rich you are.

33:27.300 --> 33:28.140
Actually, don't do that

33:28.140 --> 33:29.820
because you look like a total piece of shit,

33:29.820 --> 33:31.740
but that doesn't matter to these people

33:31.740 --> 33:34.100
because their narcissism knows no bounds.

33:34.100 --> 33:36.780
And there's finally an art installation for them

33:36.780 --> 33:39.860
down in Miami's beautiful art basil.

33:39.860 --> 33:44.740
Art basil is like the funniest world art event

33:44.740 --> 33:47.820
because it pretty much exclusively attracts-

33:47.820 --> 33:48.660
The worst people.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.660
Like these types of rich assholes.

33:50.660 --> 33:51.500
Yes.

33:51.500 --> 33:52.860
Like it's less about the art.

33:52.860 --> 33:54.940
And even the art that is on display there

33:54.940 --> 33:56.700
that I've seen fucking sucks.

33:56.700 --> 33:57.540
The banana?

33:57.540 --> 33:59.260
It's all just like weird shit

33:59.740 --> 34:02.140
that someone has managed to con their way

34:02.140 --> 34:05.100
into a certain section of rich people thinking they're cool

34:05.100 --> 34:06.740
and like, hey, more power to them,

34:06.740 --> 34:08.700
but it's not good looking art.

34:08.700 --> 34:11.020
Confidence gets you so fucking far.

34:11.020 --> 34:13.420
Yeah, Miami is just a hell of a place.

34:13.420 --> 34:15.820
Oh my God, did you see the Miami clubs

34:15.820 --> 34:16.660
that are going out of business

34:16.660 --> 34:18.020
because they don't have any crypto money coming?

34:18.020 --> 34:20.580
Another, it's just like the cocaine boom bust

34:20.580 --> 34:21.420
all over again.

34:21.420 --> 34:22.260
It really is.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.860
When the cart shells, when they finally started

34:24.860 --> 34:27.620
intercepting those planes coming in from the Caribbean,

34:27.660 --> 34:31.220
a whole ripple effect happened in Miami.

34:31.220 --> 34:34.620
Entire industries were no longer able to sustain themselves.

34:34.620 --> 34:35.620
It's actually-

34:35.620 --> 34:37.780
And now with crypto gone, it's happening again.

34:37.780 --> 34:41.820
It is insane that through decades of hard work,

34:41.820 --> 34:45.540
Florida has made itself a living experiment

34:45.540 --> 34:50.540
for like what America could be if left to its own devices.

34:51.020 --> 34:54.220
And specifically, the southern fucking tip of Florida,

34:54.220 --> 34:57.420
not counting the keys, is like it's distilled even more.

34:57.420 --> 35:00.300
Whereas like, what if everyone was on cocaine?

35:00.300 --> 35:01.580
All right, let's try it for like a decade.

35:01.580 --> 35:02.420
What if we had-

35:02.420 --> 35:04.100
What if everyone, all the crypto weirdos came here?

35:04.100 --> 35:07.540
What if giant apartment complexes just never got inspected?

35:07.540 --> 35:10.020
Yeah, and we're like literally feet from the ocean.

35:10.020 --> 35:11.020
Yeah.

35:11.020 --> 35:12.580
It's crazy.

35:12.580 --> 35:15.980
But finally, finally because of Art Basel

35:15.980 --> 35:18.340
and because of Miami, we have a very real,

35:18.340 --> 35:20.500
very truthful dick measuring contest

35:20.500 --> 35:22.980
that is available for the whole world to see.

35:22.980 --> 35:26.100
Presenting the ATM leaderboard by Mischief.

35:26.100 --> 35:26.940
Oh, Mischief.

35:27.140 --> 35:28.500
So yeah, this is actual art.

35:28.500 --> 35:31.340
They are a brand that specializes in fucking with reality.

35:31.340 --> 35:32.660
Yeah.

35:32.660 --> 35:35.260
This is an ATM machine where anyone can walk up,

35:35.260 --> 35:37.740
scan their debit card and see where they stand

35:37.740 --> 35:40.140
against other Art Basel attendees

35:40.140 --> 35:41.940
as far as liquidity is concerned.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.580
And that's the funniest part about this.

35:43.580 --> 35:45.740
Yes, these are all people who are keeping

35:46.940 --> 35:49.740
obscene amounts of money in their checking account.

35:49.740 --> 35:50.860
In their checking account, which is like

35:50.860 --> 35:53.180
the most exposed way possible.

35:53.180 --> 35:55.780
It's just like just the most baby-brained way

35:55.780 --> 35:56.900
to like store your money.

35:56.900 --> 36:00.140
Waving a flag at this fucking art fair.

36:00.980 --> 36:03.020
It is quite simply a working ATM

36:03.020 --> 36:05.220
with a computerized scoreboard attached.

36:05.220 --> 36:06.540
You put your bank card in,

36:06.540 --> 36:08.140
withdraw whatever cash you need,

36:08.140 --> 36:09.420
and the machine takes a photo of you

36:09.420 --> 36:11.780
and adds it along with your name and account balance

36:11.780 --> 36:13.140
to a scrolling leaderboard

36:13.140 --> 36:15.700
with the person who has the most money on top.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.060
As of yesterday, however,

36:17.060 --> 36:19.580
Art News reported that since Diplo topped the leaderboard

36:19.580 --> 36:23.820
with $3 million, his score has been surpassed twice already.

36:23.860 --> 36:27.020
Number two is someone with a $5 million account balance,

36:27.020 --> 36:29.540
while number one is $9 million.

36:29.540 --> 36:31.060
God only knows why anyone would need

36:31.060 --> 36:32.380
that much cash in checking.

36:32.380 --> 36:34.100
And that's what I'm saying.

36:34.100 --> 36:34.940
Yeah.

36:34.940 --> 36:36.420
Why do you need that much liquidity?

36:36.420 --> 36:38.660
Because these people are showing off.

36:38.660 --> 36:42.380
And I love so much that this outlet

36:42.380 --> 36:45.820
refused to name the two people who were at first and second

36:45.820 --> 36:47.940
because you know those people are searching

36:47.940 --> 36:49.780
every fucking bit of coverage about this

36:49.780 --> 36:51.460
to see if there are goddamn names in it.

36:51.460 --> 36:52.580
And the fact that they're like,

36:52.660 --> 36:54.060
and some fucking weirdo,

36:54.060 --> 36:56.580
some guy, random guy, 9 million, big deal.

36:56.580 --> 36:58.580
These are all dudes trying to get laid too.

36:58.580 --> 36:59.420
Yeah.

36:59.420 --> 37:01.220
Like, hey, I need to get money out of the ATM.

37:01.220 --> 37:04.140
Hey, did I see you on the leaderboard?

37:04.140 --> 37:08.340
It is like the tactic that is as old as time

37:08.340 --> 37:12.620
where people will get like their ATM balance or whatever

37:12.620 --> 37:14.220
and then like leave it in their wallet

37:14.220 --> 37:15.940
or like like it fell out.

37:15.940 --> 37:17.620
Yes, this is like a dickhead,

37:17.620 --> 37:20.940
like New York's stock exchange guy move from the 80s.

37:20.940 --> 37:25.660
Like, but anyways, they do make a good point at the end.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.100
And it's a learning moment for anyone

37:27.100 --> 37:28.900
who does carry a positive balance,

37:28.900 --> 37:30.740
which is increasingly rare in this country,

37:30.740 --> 37:33.780
but for anyone who does, first up, great job.

37:33.780 --> 37:35.180
You're doing better than a significant portion

37:35.180 --> 37:36.020
of the country.

37:36.020 --> 37:38.020
Second, don't put all your money in your checking account.

37:38.020 --> 37:39.080
No, don't do that.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.780
At the very least, keep it in savings.

37:40.780 --> 37:43.340
And also if you are a responsible person

37:43.340 --> 37:45.340
and only if you are sure

37:45.340 --> 37:47.700
that you are a responsible person, check your credit score.

37:47.700 --> 37:50.340
You should not use your debit card everywhere.

37:50.340 --> 37:51.300
You should use a credit card

37:51.300 --> 37:53.300
that you do pay off in full every month.

37:53.300 --> 37:54.300
Yeah.

37:54.300 --> 37:57.820
It builds credit and it also takes the fraud liability

37:57.820 --> 37:59.860
off of your shoulders for the most part.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.540
It's you're spending someone else's money,

38:01.540 --> 38:02.700
they're gonna fight to get it back.

38:02.700 --> 38:03.540
Yeah.

38:03.540 --> 38:06.060
When your debit card gets stolen at the gas station,

38:06.060 --> 38:07.660
that's on you, buddy.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.180
Now, having said all that, there is literally nothing positive

38:10.180 --> 38:12.700
that comes from a dick measuring contest at Art Basil.

38:12.700 --> 38:14.420
Everyone looks like an asshole,

38:14.420 --> 38:15.860
but that's kind of the point.

38:15.860 --> 38:16.700
Yeah.

38:16.700 --> 38:18.440
And with mischief behind this, that is the point.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.220
Yeah, it's an interesting social experiment.

38:20.260 --> 38:21.100
Yeah.

38:21.100 --> 38:23.860
But speaking of financial responsibility,

38:23.860 --> 38:25.860
guess what I got today?

38:25.860 --> 38:28.380
My Stadia refund in full.

38:28.380 --> 38:29.380
Oh.

38:29.380 --> 38:31.940
So everyone's like, oh, let's make fun of Ricky

38:31.940 --> 38:35.180
for trying out the new tech for his job with a tech show.

38:35.180 --> 38:37.900
Oh, we're gonna mock Ricky incessantly online

38:37.900 --> 38:38.860
and make him feel bad.

38:38.860 --> 38:40.580
Yeah, exactly, yes.

38:40.580 --> 38:42.340
Well, guess what, buddy?

38:42.340 --> 38:43.780
Despite having the money held up

38:43.780 --> 38:45.560
for however many years it's been,

38:45.560 --> 38:48.060
I got a 4K Comcast,

38:48.060 --> 38:50.460
a Bluetooth game controller,

38:50.460 --> 38:53.060
and my $140 back.

38:53.060 --> 38:55.300
Okay, yeah, I mean that, I guess that worked out.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.140
Yeah.

38:57.420 --> 38:58.860
So, there you go.

38:58.860 --> 39:00.460
Don't put your money in a checking account.

39:00.460 --> 39:02.720
Put it in Google Stadia where it's safe.

39:02.720 --> 39:04.020
Hairbrained products from Google

39:04.020 --> 39:05.780
that they're definitely gonna discontinue

39:05.780 --> 39:07.140
at the first opportunity.

39:07.140 --> 39:09.540
Google did a great job at holding onto that money for me

39:09.540 --> 39:10.780
because I would have spent it.

39:10.780 --> 39:11.620
Right.

39:11.620 --> 39:12.460
I would have spent it.

39:12.460 --> 39:13.300
You would have put it in the stock market

39:13.300 --> 39:15.140
and have you seen that graph?

39:15.140 --> 39:15.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:15.980 --> 39:17.340
Do you want Google to hold on your money

39:17.340 --> 39:18.500
in its Stadia account,

39:18.500 --> 39:20.100
or do you want to put your money into Google

39:20.100 --> 39:21.820
and have it vanish in the year 2022?

39:21.820 --> 39:23.180
This is why the best way,

39:23.180 --> 39:24.880
better than checking or savings,

39:24.880 --> 39:28.580
is you just keep all your money in GameStop pre-orders.

39:28.580 --> 39:29.420
Yes.

39:29.420 --> 39:30.260
You just pre-order everything

39:30.260 --> 39:31.100
and when you need money,

39:31.100 --> 39:32.380
you go down and you cancel your pre-order,

39:32.380 --> 39:33.740
they give you the money.

39:33.740 --> 39:34.580
Yes.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.420
As far as you can-

39:35.420 --> 39:36.260
You don't even need a bank.

39:36.260 --> 39:39.660
Literally as far as you can be away from any money you have

39:39.660 --> 39:40.980
is the best thing possible.

39:40.980 --> 39:41.820
Yeah.

39:41.820 --> 39:42.940
There you go.

39:42.940 --> 39:44.180
But anyways, I got my money back

39:44.180 --> 39:46.060
and I got a free controller and a Chromecast out of it,

39:46.060 --> 39:46.900
so fuck you, buddy.

39:46.940 --> 39:48.100
Is the controller even like work?

39:48.100 --> 39:49.140
It's a Bluetooth.

39:49.140 --> 39:49.980
Oh, okay.

39:51.780 --> 39:54.140
Would I want to play with it anywhere in public

39:54.140 --> 39:56.380
that people would see that I owned a Stadia at one point?

39:56.380 --> 39:57.420
Well, now maybe.

39:57.420 --> 39:58.620
That's a piece of video game history.

39:58.620 --> 39:59.900
It is.

39:59.900 --> 40:02.260
Anyways, that's it for today's episode.

40:02.260 --> 40:04.020
We do, of course, have more coming up for you

40:04.020 --> 40:05.340
and it'll be up soon.

40:05.340 --> 40:08.540
So in the meantime, check out our most recent episode

40:08.540 --> 40:09.380
of Weekly Weird News

40:09.380 --> 40:12.500
and a more recent episode of News Dump right over there.

40:12.500 --> 40:13.380
Guess what?

40:13.380 --> 40:15.220
All of the likes, all of the comments-

40:15.220 --> 40:16.060
It's working.

40:16.820 --> 40:17.660
You're doing it.

40:17.660 --> 40:18.500
I hate to say it,

40:18.500 --> 40:20.500
but interaction on videos actually works.

40:20.500 --> 40:21.780
It only took us like eight years

40:21.780 --> 40:23.580
to finally like actually test it out,

40:23.580 --> 40:25.420
but yeah, it actually works.

40:25.420 --> 40:26.260
It works.

40:26.260 --> 40:27.100
You're doing a wonderful job.

40:27.100 --> 40:30.220
We flew past 230,000 subscribers.

40:30.220 --> 40:31.860
So smash that like button.

40:32.820 --> 40:35.100
Leave a comment for engagement.

40:36.060 --> 40:36.900
Subscribe.

40:36.900 --> 40:38.700
I get annoyed by this kind of shit too,

40:38.700 --> 40:41.060
but I'm sorry, it works.

40:41.060 --> 40:42.020
It really works.

40:42.020 --> 40:42.860
Damn it.

40:42.860 --> 40:44.060
So watch all of our other videos,

40:44.100 --> 40:46.500
like the video, comment, do all that stuff,

40:46.500 --> 40:47.900
and have a great week.

40:47.900 --> 40:48.740
Bye-bye.

40:48.740 --> 40:49.580
Bye.
