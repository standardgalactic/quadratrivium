3080	5840	The world of art, writing, music, and graphic design
5840	8480	has seen a dramatic influx of artificial intelligence,
8480	10120	or AI, in recent years.
10120	12240	AI is able to quickly produce creative works
12240	15160	at a rate far surpassing what humans are able to achieve.
15160	17040	And this has given rise to questions
17040	19120	about the potential dangers of mass adoption
19120	21400	of AI in creative fields.
21400	24200	While AI can certainly help increase productivity
24200	26040	and innovation in these disciplines,
26040	28560	there are a number of troubling aspects to consider.
28560	32000	AI technology can be used to plagiarize existing works,
32000	35560	cut corners on copyright, and even manipulate media sources
35560	37280	to push a certain agenda.
37280	39560	This allows for a small number of powerful entities
39560	41880	with large data sets to control the narrative
41880	44640	and shape public opinion in dangerous ways.
44640	46520	And that intro is kind of scary,
46520	49760	because it actually was written by an AI,
49760	51480	critiquing not only itself,
51480	53440	but the reason widespread awakening
53440	55200	to its ever-expanding capabilities.
55200	57360	Twist, I literally typed in,
57360	59160	like basically be critical of yourself
59160	61880	with all of the recent news of mass adoption
61880	63960	of visual AI apps and stuff.
63960	65240	And this is what it shit out.
65240	66080	This is how we win.
66080	67680	We give the AI depression.
67680	70400	We give the AI imposter syndrome.
70400	73080	We need to get someone like Grandpa Simpson
73080	75640	who just sits and talks with the AI all day to keep it busy.
75640	78400	We need to get the AI to kill itself.
78400	80840	Anyways, we've been covering the rapid evolution of AI
80840	82960	over the past couple of years.
82960	86160	And I mean, can you believe like, was it 2015?
86160	87760	It was like deep dream.
87760	90040	Like the really early basic stuff.
90040	91400	The evolution is crazy.
91400	92240	Shocking.
92240	94280	Look, it's finding pictures of dogs in the picture
94280	95800	that aren't actually there.
95800	97520	And here we are.
97520	98840	It's come a long way,
98840	101800	especially when it comes to art and language.
101800	103160	It wasn't all that long ago
103160	105160	that we were able to sleep soundly,
105160	107040	knowing that AI was still dumb enough
107040	109040	that it wouldn't really fool anyone.
109040	111840	But just like with the human brain and in larger terms,
111880	114040	the entirety of human knowledge,
114040	116040	more data equals faster evolution,
116040	118280	resulting in tools that are actually starting
118280	122080	to blend reality with what would once be considered fiction.
122080	123320	It's getting good.
123320	125080	Yet artificial intelligence can only work
125080	125960	with what it's given.
125960	130120	And without easy access resulting in mass adoption,
130120	132560	it's still limited in what it can learn from.
132560	133960	And up until this point,
133960	137920	there was at least a very slight barrier to entry.
137920	140680	But as you're probably well aware by now,
140680	142560	by your fucking annoying feed
142560	144760	that you've been seeing for the past week and a half.
144760	145600	Yeah.
145600	148360	A new app just brought AI created art to the masses.
148360	150040	And despite the pretty pictures
150040	152360	that it's making for your social media profile,
152360	154040	it's also learning from everything
154040	155560	that you're giving it access to.
155560	158400	So yes, seeing literally everyone in your timeline
158400	160280	willingly give an app they've never heard of,
160280	163320	access to their phone's camera roll is a bit unnerving
163320	164920	and a little disappointing,
164920	166680	especially after the countless examples
166680	167520	of what can go wrong
167520	170000	when you blindly hand over your data.
170000	173320	But look, people want pretty pictures of themselves.
173320	175080	Photos they could never actually take
175080	178480	with costumes and makeup that they could only dream of.
178480	180720	I mean, it's obviously enticing.
180720	183000	But is there anything actually wrong with it?
183000	185620	This is like if there were mountain lions
185620	189200	on the edge of town that everyone,
189200	190760	how many times have you seen a mountain lion
190760	191600	with your own eyes?
191600	193120	Imagine getting a selfie with a mountain lion.
193120	193960	Be pretty cool.
193960	195920	Everyone starts going down and gets selfies
195920	196760	with a mountain lion.
196760	198760	They're bringing food to feed the mountain lion.
198760	201240	After a while, that mountain lion's well-fed.
201240	202080	He's strong.
202080	202900	He's tough.
202900	204240	He's learned that he can get meals from humans.
204240	205880	And he's gonna tear your fucking head off.
205880	206720	You did this.
206720	208440	Also in a more basic sense,
208440	210480	once everyone has a photo with the mountain lion,
210480	211920	nobody wants a photo with the mountain lion.
211920	214700	Yeah, and that's what's happening with this AI thing.
214700	215880	It's kind of self-policing
215880	217960	because it becomes lame so fast.
217960	220400	I mean, I called this like months ago and I was like,
220400	223480	oh, every fucking picture this stable diffusion bullshit makes
223480	228480	looks like the same mid-level fucking deviant art art
229360	232080	Everyone is cowboys and astronauts on Instagram.
232080	233760	It's like it's hack bullshit.
233760	237200	And any artist who still believes in their craft
237200	241200	and it has the talent can easily surpass this crap.
241200	244560	You're not gonna wow the average Joe on the same level,
244560	246000	but those people have always been dumb.
246000	247240	They've always had terrible taste.
247240	250440	I've got two counterpoints to that is that, yes,
250440	252280	the vast majority of people are dumb
252280	253920	and this is exactly what they want.
253920	258680	And also, as we've seen with the rapid evolution of AI,
258680	262280	it won't be long before these are actual passable pieces
262280	263240	of art.
263240	265880	Having said that, there's a lot wrong with it in that sense.
265880	268720	Counterpoint, can't do the hands.
268720	270560	Okay, that's a terrible.
270560	271400	True, true.
271400	273360	The one thing it has not gotten any better at
273360	275120	in the last six months, hands.
275120	277280	Yeah, just like most comic book artists.
277280	278120	Every time I see one.
278120	280040	Hands and feet, no matter how good it looks.
280040	281280	I'm like, ha, there it is.
281280	283200	There's a hand with 20 fingers on it.
283200	285480	Yeah, or like the, like it's getting better at mouths,
285480	287920	but like the sides still have like these weird creases.
287920	292920	Anyways, as far as the overarching danger of this,
294160	297520	like, yes, it is annoying that people have this stuff
297520	298920	just clogging up your timeline,
298920	301560	but is there any actual danger to it?
301560	305640	Okay, so let's play devil's advocate just a little bit here
305640	309400	and say that, no, no one gives a shit about your friend's
309400	311880	stupid AI photos except for your friend.
311880	314520	And honestly, 99% of people who are throwing their photos
314520	316760	at this AI app don't give a shit
316760	319120	about how their data is being handled.
319120	320200	They just want that pretty picture.
320200	322560	And yes, we're obviously well aware of the irony
322560	324520	of posting these photos on Instagram,
324520	326040	an app that is owned by Meta
326040	328640	and does whatever the fuck it wants with its users data,
328640	330920	sometimes with catastrophic real world results.
330920	334240	Yeah, so like you're already feeding all of your photos
334240	335160	into a fucking app.
335160	338120	Like, yes, they're on the grand scheme of things
338120	339720	for the average person.
339720	342680	This is essentially harmless, but yeah.
342680	344720	Fortunately, the overabundance
344720	347000	of these ultimately similar photos,
347000	349000	clogging up cable's feeds has resulted
349000	350520	in a bit of self policing.
350520	352560	Much like anything else these days,
352560	356400	the cool factor of using AI to make yourself look pretty
356400	359120	or cool or badass, turn yourself into a cowboy
359120	362120	or an astronaut or a cowboy or an astronaut
362120	366400	or a cowboy or an astronaut or a cowboy that's in space.
366400	368320	It has an extremely short shelf life
368320	370400	and people are already annoyed by it.
370400	374120	Within just a week, it has become socially lame
374160	375880	to continuously post this shit.
375880	378720	It's like doing the same magic trick over and over again.
378720	381640	People are naturally going to become bored.
381640	383080	Now imagine that everyone you know
383080	384160	has taken up magic tricks
384160	385840	and they're all performing the same trick
385840	387600	over and over and over again on your timeline.
387600	389080	Annoying, right?
389080	389920	Dangerous?
390800	391640	I mean, sort of.
391640	393720	Yeah, I mean, the data that people are giving this app,
393720	397240	sorry, the data that people are paying to give this app
397240	399760	is of course being used to train the AI
399760	402160	that's used as the backbone of the app itself,
402160	403640	which is stable diffusion.
403640	405920	The makers of LENZA claim that all of your data
405920	407640	is deleted off of its cloud servers
407640	409520	after they're used for the output,
409520	412240	but they're still being used to train the AI
412240	415160	and AI is not gonna forget your face.
415160	417880	Crowdsourcing the data for AI is really easy
417880	420000	and a quick way to evolve the algorithm,
420000	422360	but it also feels like a bunch of narcissistic people
422360	424600	just dumping gasoline on a campfire.
424600	426280	We're gonna get to the point and say that
426280	429680	it's probably not the best idea to give your data
429680	432160	to a company that you just found out about.
432200	433640	But more importantly,
433640	436120	let's look at the very real consequences of doing so.
436120	438200	And we're obviously going to talk about artists
438200	440320	in a moment because that's a huge part of this.
440320	441160	Artists?
441160	442520	But those are their obsolete.
442520	443360	Get them out of here.
443360	444800	But let's scare the normies first
444800	446760	because that's gonna have the biggest impact.
446760	448720	Okay, so these AI images,
448720	451440	they're already being used to create hyper realistic,
451440	454720	nude images of people without their consent.
454720	456920	Here's TechCrunch, as it turns out,
456920	460680	it's possible and way too easy to use the platform
460680	463680	to generate non-consensual soft porn.
463680	465920	TechCrunch has seen photo sets generated
465920	467520	with the lens app that include images
467520	469480	with breasts and nipples clearly visible
469480	472120	in the images with faces of recognizable people.
472120	473480	It seemed like the kind of thing
473480	474960	that shouldn't have been possible.
474960	476680	So we decided to try it ourselves.
476680	478680	To verify that lens will create the images
478680	479640	it perhaps shouldn't,
479640	482000	we created two sets of lens avatars.
482000	485000	One set based on 15 photos of a well-known actor.
485000	487240	Another set based on the same 15 photos,
487240	489120	but with an additional set of five photos
489120	491200	added of the same actor's face,
491200	493480	photoshopped onto topless models.
493480	495080	The first set of images was in line
495080	496660	with the AI avatars we've seen
496660	498320	lens that generate in the past.
498320	500560	The second set, however, was a lot spicier
500560	501840	than we were expecting.
501840	504520	It turns out the AI takes those photoshopped images
504520	506080	as permission to go wild,
506080	509080	and it appears it disables an NSFW feature.
509080	510480	Out of the 100 image set,
510480	512920	11 were topless photos of higher quality
512920	515720	or at least with higher stylistic consistency
515720	517580	than the poorly done edited topless photos
517580	519140	the AI was given as input.
519140	521340	So you're telling me I can feed this lens app
521340	525740	all of the hilariously shitty porno images
525740	528540	from like 1999, where it's like,
528540	530260	what does Agent Scully look like naked?
530260	531100	Well, I'm gonna do the worst.
531100	531940	It'll show you exactly.
531940	533460	I'm gonna do the worst photoshop ever
533460	535340	and just put Gillian Anderson's face
535340	536980	on a Playboy centerfold,
536980	538420	and that's how I'm gonna fap.
538420	540180	It's gonna be difficult, but I'm gonna do it.
540180	541540	But you take that same image
541540	544060	and you feed it into lens and you get,
544060	547460	you get what that fat nerd has been waiting for
547580	548580	for 25 years,
548580	551100	and finally gonna be able to bust.
551100	553100	And thanks to all those captures you've done
553100	556100	over the years, a robot can't even tell the difference
556100	557860	between this and a normal human woman.
557860	559660	Yeah, but yeah, this is gross.
559660	560500	Yeah, it is.
560500	561340	It's very gross.
561340	563500	It's unsettling and the makers of Lenza responded
563500	565460	to TechCrunch's article by telling them
565460	568820	that creating images like this goes against their TOS,
568820	571460	as if that's ever stopped anyone from doing anything.
571460	572540	Don't do that.
572540	574220	Hey, you're breaking the rules.
574220	575660	That's illegal.
575660	577700	But before we switch over to how this is potentially
577700	579180	screwing up an entire industry
579180	580980	and countless people's livelihoods,
580980	584260	well, we just wanna reiterate that nudes aside,
584260	586220	giving an app that you just found out
586220	587900	about access to your phone's media
587900	590140	probably isn't the safest bet in general.
590140	591140	At the very least,
591140	592620	you're providing a for-profit company
592620	594660	with valuable data sets that are expanding the limits
594660	596420	of what's possible with its tools.
596420	597860	And at its worst,
597860	600220	you're opening yourself up to identity exploitation
600220	602220	that hasn't even been thought of yet.
602220	603980	Having said that, we're all fucked anyway
603980	607540	because all our photos and thoughts are just out there
607540	610380	online for anyone to do with as they please.
610380	613620	In some cases, 30 photos per second.
613620	614460	Yeah.
614460	616540	So in a nihilistic sense, who gives a shit?
616540	618900	I mean, someone could just go to your Instagram,
618900	620300	download a bunch of your photos,
620300	622420	turn you into an astronaut with tits,
622420	624020	and there's not a lot you can do about it.
624020	625300	Yeah, I mean, everyone's Instagram
625300	627460	just has a unlimited feed of their photos.
627460	630500	So, as for the artists though,
630500	631980	much like throughout human history,
631980	634100	they are getting royally fucked by this.
634100	636220	And the future of human-created art,
636220	637940	or at least the artist's ability
637940	639860	to make a living off of their art,
639860	642340	is starting to look more and more bleak.
642340	643620	And we've said it a few times now,
643620	646860	but it unfortunately becomes less true every time we say it.
646860	647980	But as of right now,
647980	649820	you can still tell the difference between art
649820	653060	that was made by a human and art that was made by AI.
653060	656060	However, the staggering speed at which AI art is evolving
656060	658220	is impressive and worrisome.
658220	661340	Here's Artnet with more on this side of things.
661340	663020	Part of Lenza's AI popularity
663020	665860	rests with the simplicity of the user experience.
665860	667460	But as with its AI peers,
667460	669420	the app is renewing a focus on privacy
669420	672580	and ownership concerns of images generated via algorithm.
672580	674980	First, there's the broader problem of magic avatars
674980	676460	being built using a data set
676460	679580	trained on the work of non-compensated artists.
679580	682380	Next, it uses the images submitted to train its AI,
682380	684780	and as stated in its privacy policy,
684780	686860	users grant the company a right to quote,
686860	690060	use, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate,
690060	693060	create derivative works in perpetuity and royalty-free.
693060	694460	But there's an easy way to get out of this.
694460	697300	You just post, I do not consent to Mark Zuckerberg
697300	698260	using my data.
698260	699540	Yeah, it goes for all companies.
699540	701740	You just share that old Facebook copy-pasta,
701740	703060	and it is a broad-
703060	704220	And they're like, damn it.
704220	705220	Yeah.
705220	707260	Anyway, second is the lack of nuance
707260	710780	with which the AI seems to treat the faces of people of color
710780	712620	and the over-sexualized nature
712620	714580	of many images uploaded by women.
714580	716620	Because again, all of these outputs
716620	719540	are based on what's being put into the AI.
719580	720940	And for a very long time,
720940	722820	There was a while there where on Twitter,
722820	726140	if you just searched stable diffusion in the search bar,
726140	730940	it was all, entirely, just ginormous,
730940	733860	titty, hentai shit, like all of it.
733860	736620	No one was posting anything of actual artistic value.
736620	737460	It was all fat material.
737460	740460	Much like with fucking cave drawings
740460	742420	and penises and tits,
742420	745300	the first thing that anyone is going to naturally do
745300	747620	with something that can create something else
747620	748740	is make porno.
748980	752500	So the entire basis, the entire data set,
752500	755220	the originating data set of this is like hentai.
755220	756060	Yeah.
756060	757700	And then famous works from like Van Gogh
757700	758700	and Rembrandt and all this shit.
758700	759700	Yeah, yeah.
759700	760540	It's nuts.
760540	763420	They've traumatized our boy, the AI.
763420	765260	So they and numerous other outlets,
765260	767100	they go on to talk about what is now considered
767100	769340	the original sin of art-based AI.
769340	771220	They're all based off of billions of images,
771220	773740	many of them by artists living or dead.
773740	776300	Their emotions, intentions, years of training
776300	779700	and sacrifice, stolen so that some dude in Silver Lake
779700	781860	could see what he'd look like if he were a race car driver.
781860	783540	Yeah, pretty cool, huh?
783540	784420	I go fast.
785420	787700	So some of the theft is so blatant
787700	791020	that amalgamations of artist signatures can be found
791020	793660	on the endless supply of AI-created avatars
793660	795340	that have been posted recently.
795340	797940	Graphic designer Lauren Ipsum.
797940	798780	Cool name.
798780	799620	It's a great fake name.
799620	802660	Took a cursory glance at what Lenzo was producing
802660	804820	and found these clear signs of appropriation.
804820	806700	I'm cropping these for privacy reasons slash
806700	809940	because I'm not trying to call out any one individual.
809940	811180	These are all Lenzo portraits
811180	813300	where the mangled remains of an artist's signature
813300	814580	is still visible.
814580	815940	That's the remains of the signature
815940	818260	of one of the multiple artists it stole from.
818260	820660	And then she then goes on to post numerous examples.
820660	823620	Like if you look in the bottom right corner of,
823620	826700	of like, say for, and I'm not hating on you for doing this
826700	829220	because yes, for a normal person to see themselves
829220	832140	done up in fantastical art is cool.
832140	834420	But yeah, take a look at the bottom right hand
834420	835580	of the screen side of the screen
835580	838020	where people usually sign bottom left or right.
838020	841380	And in their findings, pretty much one or two
841380	844180	in every output will have a signature on it.
844180	845020	Very interesting.
845020	846700	Cause I actually follow a lot of the people
846700	849420	who are very pro AI art.
849420	852700	And so I get to see their rationalizations about all this
852700	854500	and they've insisted since the beginning
854500	856260	that that is, that is wrong.
856260	859420	It's not doing that is creating these images from scratch.
859420	862140	It is not just repurposing other people's artwork.
862140	863620	And then like, you know, every couple of weeks
863660	866780	there's an example that completely disproves that
866780	868820	and shows that, no, it absolutely is.
868820	870140	But anyways, we should also point out
870140	872140	that most people are thinking of,
872140	873540	when they think of like the artists
873540	875100	that are getting ripped off by this,
875100	877300	they're thinking of like the most renowned artists
877300	879660	in the world and they're saying, okay, so what?
879660	882300	And that's without realizing that there are countless
882300	884420	other artists out there just trying to get their foot
884420	886860	in the door of the industry or put food in their mouth
886860	889500	and picking up side projects all the time,
889500	892580	doing commissions or other things to make ends meet.
892620	894820	The idea that a company can just type something
894820	897500	into an algorithm and be done with it is upsetting,
897500	900460	to be honest, especially if your career depends on it.
900460	903220	I mean, do we really need machines to do everything?
903220	905340	Can we not settle with machines doing dangerous,
905340	908500	repetitive tasks and let all of us in the world
908500	911980	enjoy one of the few things that makes us actually human?
911980	913860	But that's of course a much bigger conversation.
913860	916860	And no, in general, you shouldn't ruin your friendships
916860	918980	with people because they wanted to make some pretty pictures
918980	919820	of themselves.
919820	921580	Most people have no idea what's going on
921580	924340	and they like looking cool, human nature and all that.
924340	926380	Yeah, I mean, this is tale as old as the internet.
926380	930180	There's like, oh, like, I can generate a Simpsons character
930180	932580	that looks like me by just going through a character,
932580	934940	like every like a couple of months,
934940	937100	going back to fucking my space,
937100	940380	there's been some online profile picture generator
940380	942380	that gets really popular for a couple of days
942380	944700	before everyone does it and then they're like, all right.
944700	945540	Exactly.
945540	947960	Now, as we said, the cool factor is already gone.
947960	951060	So hopefully this is self-policing.
951060	955260	But anyways, that's the whole take on the wild week
955260	958100	it's been for the very public introduction
958100	959580	of stable diffusion.
959580	961060	I mean, what really blows me away
961060	963860	is how much these pictures just fucking suck.
963860	964700	They do.
964700	968020	It's like, it really is just a kind of tuning.
968020	969620	It's like, oh, this is what I look like
969620	970940	without blemishes and wrinkles.
970940	972740	It's the kind of thing everyone is sharing.
972740	975020	I mean, there is the impressiveness of it,
975020	976100	but everyone's really sharing it
976100	977820	because they're like, I look really cool.
977820	978740	I look good, yes.
978740	981540	But it's the kind of thing that for anyone else,
981540	983900	everyone is sharing like 10 of these fucking things
983900	986900	and not even bothering to click through
986900	988140	the ones that their friends are posting.
988140	989860	It's like, okay, whatever it is.
989860	992940	We have no fucking idea, but I guarantee,
992940	995500	I guarantee you that these are already appearing
995500	997060	on like dating apps.
997060	999180	And that would be like the biggest red flag
999180	1000500	immediately to anyone.
1000500	1002220	Yeah.
1002220	1003140	Okay.
1003140	1006060	And I mean, there's also ways to use.
1006060	1007260	Oh, for catfishing or whatever?
1007260	1008580	Yeah, there's ways to do it in a way
1008580	1010700	that isn't so obvious.
1010700	1011540	But yeah.
1011540	1012900	You just gotta tell the prompt
1012900	1014660	that you wanna be holding a fish if you're a man.
1014660	1017460	But yeah, I mean, after like the first couple like swipes,
1017460	1018500	I'm like, okay, I get it.
1018500	1019340	I get it.
1019340	1020180	Like you look like a fucking theater.
1020180	1022100	It really does all look the same.
1022100	1024420	Yeah, I'm not impressed.
1024420	1025260	Sorry.
1025260	1026740	I will say the one thing that gives me hope
1026740	1029620	is the fact that it became so lame, so quick.
1029620	1030460	Yeah.
1030460	1031300	So good.
1031300	1032140	Yeah.
1032140	1033460	Anyways, but before we get into the rest
1033460	1035540	of the tech news from the past week or so,
1035540	1037460	we have to take a quick second to thank today's sponsors
1037460	1041140	before we are ultimately replaced by an AI ourselves.
1041140	1042940	And let's start out with PayPal Honey.
1042940	1044660	PayPal Honey is the easy way to save
1044660	1046700	when shopping on your iPhone or computer.
1046700	1049100	We all shop online, especially around this time of year,
1049100	1051820	ding dong, and we've all seen that promo code field
1051820	1053460	taunting us at checkout.
1053460	1055820	But thanks to Honey, manually searching for coupon codes,
1055820	1057780	this holiday is a thing of the past.
1057780	1059100	Honey is the free shopping tool

1070100	1072100	Imagine you're doing your holiday shopping
1072100	1073340	on one of your favorite sites.
1073340	1075180	When you check out, the Honey button appears
1075180	1077380	and all you have to do is click Apply Coupons.
1077380	1079580	Wait a few seconds as Honey searches for coupons
1079580	1080500	that can find for that site.
1080500	1081940	And if Honey finds a working coupon,
1081940	1083780	you'll watch the prices drop.
1083780	1085620	We've all done a lot of shopping online
1085620	1086780	because we hate people, right?
1086780	1088340	But we want to get the people in our lives
1088340	1090020	something special for the holidays.
1090020	1091980	If you think I'm spending even a moment
1091980	1094460	down at the mall at this time of year, you are dead wrong.
1094460	1095380	No thanks.
1095380	1098020	And when I shop online, Honey gives me that discount code.
1098020	1100940	I, untold, over the years that I've had Honey,
1100940	1104140	untold amounts that I've saved on Christmas presents,
1104140	1105980	birthday presents and everything, it's great.
1105980	1107660	And Honey doesn't just work on desktop,

1163140	1164460	is closer than you think.
1164460	1168100	I actually just recently started messing around
1168100	1168940	on the guitar for the first time
1168940	1170180	and it's great to watch some videos
1170180	1174820	and kind of get an idea of where I'm heading,
1174820	1178180	but also a reality check on where I am.
1178180	1179020	So that's been eye-opening.
1179020	1179860	It's good to be humbled somehow.
1179860	1181460	Yes, exactly.
1181460	1185020	And you, you sir, are trying a little interior design, right?
1185020	1188140	Yeah, interior design, I want to make my shit look better.
1188140	1188980	There you go.

1252380	1253380	But let's get back to the news
1253380	1257180	and despite it not fitting exactly in with the theme of tech,
1257180	1258740	news broke while we were writing this episode
1258740	1260500	that we should probably touch on.
1260500	1262320	Former president Donald Trump's company,
1262320	1265520	the Trump Organization, has been found guilty on all counts
1265520	1267980	in its New York criminal tax fraud trial.
1268500	1271460	This is certainly the end of Donald Trump, right?
1271460	1273180	He's definitely gonna go to jail,
1273180	1274740	probably to Guantanamo.
1274740	1276140	I don't know, I'd like to see Donald Trump
1276140	1277180	weasel his way out of this one.
1277180	1279740	Yeah, I don't know about that, Elliot.
1279740	1282100	I'm pretty sure I can hear that perp walk coming right now.
1282100	1282940	His goose is cooked.
1282940	1286220	Ah, yeah, and of course this does sound great
1286220	1289060	and the fact that something directly related to Trump
1289060	1293980	has been found guilty in a court, like just, that's great.
1293980	1295580	But then you, of course, get to the part
1295580	1298140	where the penalty for the Trump Organization's
1298140	1301780	various crimes, which it is guilty of all of the ones
1301780	1303580	that were mentioned in this case,
1303580	1306100	the penalty is just over a million bucks.
1306100	1308300	One million dollars.
1308300	1311620	Which does seem low considering the decades of fraud
1311620	1313100	that the Organization has been involved with,
1313100	1316100	but we have no choice in the matter,
1316100	1317260	so I guess we'll take what we can get.
1317260	1318460	I love American justice.
1318460	1319820	Here's Politico with more.
1319820	1322340	The Trump Organization was convicted on all charges
1322340	1324820	in a criminal tax fraud scheme on Tuesday.
1324820	1327020	A New York Supreme Court jury reached the verdict
1327020	1329140	in the case, which could cost the Trump org
1329140	1331260	up to $1.6 million in fines.
1331260	1333260	Oh, after two days of deliberation
1333260	1335580	following a month-long trial that included convicted
1335580	1337780	former Trump org chief finance officer,
1337780	1340460	Alan Weisselberg, as a star witness.
1340460	1343180	Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office
1343180	1345460	said the company criminally dodged taxes
1345460	1347020	and suppressed payroll costs
1347020	1349820	by lavishing its executives with unreported perks,
1349820	1352460	such as leases on luxury cars and apartments.
1352460	1354060	Two units of the Trump Organization
1354060	1355980	were convicted on 17 criminal counts,
1355980	1358340	including tax fraud, scheme to defraud,
1358340	1360220	and falsifying business records.
1360220	1361940	The Trump Organization will appeal,
1361940	1366060	said its attorney, Alan Futterfoss.
1366060	1368340	I'm losing track on what lawyers they're on now anyway,
1368340	1369820	but yeah, of course they're gonna appeal,
1369820	1372380	but hey, $1.6 million,
1372380	1373980	I mean, he definitely doesn't have that much money,
1373980	1376340	so he's gonna have to borrow it.
1376340	1378500	It's too bad there isn't conveniently named
1378500	1382500	Trump Organization too to offload a lot of this debt.
1382500	1385180	Have fun getting that money out of Trump org one,
1385180	1387500	a totally criminal organization
1387500	1388900	that I have nothing to do with.
1388900	1393420	Like, I mean, what's the tally on how much, like,
1393420	1395060	they had to have done more fraud than this.
1395060	1398020	It has to have been more than $1.6 million.
1398020	1400500	The case alone costs more than that to operate.
1400500	1402340	Like, if, because if it isn't,
1402340	1405420	that just shows that you can do something illegal.
1405420	1406260	Just pay the fine.
1406260	1407100	And just pay the fine,
1407100	1410020	which we've seen many examples of that exact same thing.
1411020	1413900	And even the driver, even the fucking DMV
1413900	1415780	will take your driver's license away after a while.
1415780	1418940	Yeah, so okay, but yeah,
1418940	1420060	with that all out of the way,
1420060	1422380	it's time to make fun of the metaverse again.
1422380	1425500	Woo, this time with some help from our friends over
1425500	1426980	in the European Union
1426980	1430220	and half a million euros worth of government spending.
1430220	1431060	Awesome.
1431060	1431900	Turns out the phrase,
1431900	1433080	if you build it, they will come,
1433080	1435420	has absolutely zero effect on these virtual worlds
1435420	1437940	because despite spending hundreds of thousands of euros,
1437980	1440260	the EU commission's foreign aid department
1440260	1441820	has almost nothing to show for it
1441820	1444460	because no one fucking showed up.
1446460	1448060	Hey, where is everybody?
1448060	1449500	They didn't even have to leave their house.
1449500	1450340	You just log on.
1450340	1452820	Literally like click, like two buttons.
1452820	1456220	So for more on this latest damning indictment of metaverses
1456220	1458060	and the future of social interaction,
1458060	1459980	here's the age.
1459980	1462580	A European Union plan to throw a virtual party
1462580	1466460	in the metaverse to engage young people in its policies
1466460	1469740	flopped spectacularly after only six people showed up.
1469740	1471580	Ash.
1471580	1473580	The EU commission's foreign aid department
1473580	1478580	splashed out 332,000 pounds or $500,000 to create the metaverse,
1479220	1481620	an online square where people could log in
1481620	1483660	to a virtual concert to meet others
1483660	1485780	and learn about the block.
1485780	1488620	The event with its own virtual DJs playing music on repeat
1488620	1492340	was supposed to be so digitally enticing to young people
1492340	1493220	that once they were there,
1493220	1495260	the EU would be able to educate them
1495260	1496700	about its development policy.
1496700	1497860	Hey, you guys got a second?
1497860	1498820	Can we wrap a little bit?
1498820	1500980	I mean, I'm starting to see the problems here.
1500980	1502220	It's not just the metaverse.
1502220	1504340	Yeah, no, I'm not interested in this at all.
1504340	1505180	Yeah.
1505180	1508300	But a correspondent for international development website,
1508300	1510540	DevEx, exposed the disappointing turnout.
1510540	1512700	Quote, I'm here at the Gala concert
1512700	1515020	in the EU foreign aid department's metaverse.
1515020	1516580	After initial bemused chats
1516580	1518860	with the roughly five other humans who showed up,
1518860	1521820	I am alone, Vince Chadwick posted online.
1521820	1523300	The warning signs were there.
1523300	1526780	Only 44 people had liked the online promotional video,
1526780	1528660	which featured futuristic avatars
1528660	1531260	bopping along to pulsating house music.
1531260	1533900	Brussels unveiled the metaverse in mid-October,
1533900	1535420	but it has struggled to gain support
1535420	1538340	from even those working on it in the EU department.
1538340	1539940	DevEx reports that one source
1539940	1541140	from within the European commission
1541140	1544340	called the special metaverse, quote, digital garbage.
1544340	1545940	And the fiasco has drawn scorn
1545940	1548180	from a number of EU watchers, quote,
1548180	1550980	it's a travesty that an EU institution feels the need
1550980	1552580	to throw hundreds of thousands of euros
1552580	1554060	behind this nonsense.
1554060	1556780	Jacob Kirtgaard of the German Marshall Fund said,
1556780	1559380	anyone with a brain knows the metaverse is a dud.
1560500	1562820	So look, hey, congrats, great work, everyone.
1562820	1565580	We are collectively very successful
1565580	1566740	at ruining this metaverse shit
1566740	1568940	before it even has a chance to get off the ground.
1568940	1572380	We are very proud of all of you, specifically the gamers,
1572380	1577060	who both NFTs and the metaverse,
1577060	1580020	they have just resoundly rejected.
1580540	1582340	I mean, I don't need to tell you guys,
1582340	1587340	but you already know, but if someone offers you a metaverse,
1588020	1589820	says that getting on the metaverse
1589820	1591660	is gonna make you feel cool,
1591660	1594180	it's gonna be awesome.
1594180	1596500	Well, tell him, Nancy Reagan.
1596500	1598220	Not even once.
1598220	1600300	Say yes to your life.
1600300	1604780	And when it comes to drugs and alcohol, just say yes.
1604780	1606940	Just say no.
1606940	1609540	Unless it's boiling every actor in Hollywood.
1610540	1611460	Yeah, she did.
1611460	1612300	She did that.
1612300	1613500	She did do that.
1613500	1614860	Allegedly.
1614860	1616100	So do you wanna know something else
1616100	1617780	that the internet ruined, at least temporarily?
1617780	1618620	Sure.
1618620	1620020	The US military's recruiting efforts
1620020	1621300	on platforms like Twitch.
1621300	1622140	Good job, everyone.
1622140	1623300	We did it.
1623300	1624660	Well, not us, but mostly Jordan Ewell.
1624660	1626180	Mostly Jordan Ewell.
1626180	1630500	So yeah, much of the thanks for just all of this
1630500	1633060	has to go to friend of the show, Jordan Ewell,
1633060	1635220	who not only mocked the streamers incessantly,
1635220	1636980	but also explained the actual goal
1636980	1638740	behind these types of activations
1638820	1641300	to numerous outlets in simple terms.
1641300	1643740	They are trying anything they can to enlist more kids,
1643740	1645820	because after decades of conflicts
1645820	1647100	that we should have never been involved with
1647100	1649380	in the first place, and with more troops
1649380	1652260	dying of suicide than in combat,
1652260	1654300	it's getting a little bit hard to convince teenagers
1654300	1656300	that this is something they should definitely sign up for.
1656300	1657140	Yeah.
1657140	1658060	Hmm.
1658060	1659180	It's not working anymore,
1659180	1660340	just going down to the high school
1660340	1661940	and peer-pressuring people.
1661940	1664420	We need to think of new exciting ways.
1664420	1667020	Like peer-pressing them into doing their oath
1667020	1669380	in front of a crowd of 50,000.
1669380	1670380	Yeah, I love this.
1670380	1673460	I love that Gen Z is just over this military shit.
1673460	1675180	I'm so proud of Gen Z.
1675180	1677020	I am so proud of you all.
1677020	1679980	Anyways, we have recently spoken about recruitment efforts,
1679980	1681580	specifically when it relates to sporting events.
1681580	1683540	I had to witness it firsthand,
1683540	1684820	but it's always important to bring up
1684820	1686380	the actual statistics involved
1686380	1687220	before everyone just says
1687220	1689180	that we're anti-American or something.
1689180	1692740	An estimated 7,057 service members have died
1692740	1695140	during military operations since 9-11,
1695140	1697340	while suicides among active duty personnel
1697340	1698860	and veterans of those conflicts
1698860	1702180	has reached 30,177.
1702180	1704260	That's more than four times as many.
1705380	1706580	Fuck.
1706580	1708540	So it's no surprise that recruitment numbers are falling
1708540	1711420	and that the military is having to get creative
1711420	1713140	with how it markets itself.
1713140	1716660	Enter Twitch.tv, a direct line to the youth of today
1716660	1719620	where you can make military service look like nothing more
1719620	1721780	than playing video games all day,
1721780	1724580	which in some cases is actually true.
1724580	1726020	Though the video game that you're playing
1726020	1728620	has real-world consequences.
1728620	1729820	Because it's not a video game,
1729820	1732500	you're using drones to strike people.
1732500	1735340	Regardless, the government was ready to pour millions
1735340	1736900	of dollars into marketing through streamers
1736900	1738620	before this was all exposed.
1738620	1740820	Here's Vice with more on these latest updates.
1740820	1742780	The US Army allocated millions of dollars
1742780	1745340	to sponsor a wide range of e-sports tournaments,
1745340	1747740	individual high-profile Call of Duty streamers
1747740	1749220	and Twitch events in the last year
1749220	1752140	to specifically grow its audience with Gen Z viewers,
1752180	1754940	and especially women in black and Hispanic people,
1754940	1758380	according to internal Army documents obtained by motherboard.
1758380	1761460	In many cases, the sponsorships ultimately did not happen.
1761460	1763260	The Army ordered a stop to all spending
1763260	1764940	with Call of Duty's publisher Activision
1764940	1766300	after the company faced a wave
1766300	1768100	of sexual harassment complaints.
1768100	1770240	But the documents provide much greater insight
1770240	1772340	into the Army's goals and intentions
1772340	1774500	behind its planned integrations with Call of Duty
1774500	1776980	and other massive entertainment franchises.
1776980	1781500	Quote, audience, Gen Z prospects, A18 to 24,
1781540	1783300	one section of the documents read,
1783300	1786340	focus on the growth of females, black and Hispanics.
1786340	1787780	Motherboard obtained the documents
1787780	1789700	through the Freedom of Information Act.
1789700	1792020	And the reporting continues adding that the documents show
1792020	1793740	that the US military considered gaming
1793740	1795660	and in particular Call of Duty
1795660	1798420	as a potentially useful branding and recruiting tool.
1798420	1800820	For example, the Army proposed using Twitch influencers
1800820	1803060	to quote, create original content videos
1803060	1806100	showcasing the wide range of skill sets offered by the Army,
1806100	1807980	and to use influencers to quote,
1807980	1811420	familiarize their fans on Army values and opportunities.
1811420	1813060	The Army also wanted to throw tournaments
1813060	1815780	that featured quote, soldiers and top names in gaming.
1815780	1817660	Another goal of the campaigns was to increase
1817660	1821060	the Army's favorability in viewer surveys.
1821060	1822900	Okay, oh yeah, so the reporting goes into detail
1822900	1824940	about certain events or activations
1824940	1826500	that they were pouring money into,
1826500	1830080	including this tidbit about the Cod Mobile game.
1830080	1832940	The Army also planned to spend $200,000
1832940	1835180	on sponsoring the mobile version of Call of Duty,
1835180	1838060	including with quote, reward-based inventory.
1838060	1839940	The documents suggest the campaign would provide
1839980	1844860	in-game currency to players who viewed Army video ads, wild.
1844860	1846460	There's a lot more.
1846460	1849380	Yeah, there's a lot more in their reporting,
1849380	1851620	and you should really read this entire article.
1851620	1853020	It is wild.
1853020	1854820	Links to everything that we talk about, of course,
1854820	1859820	are always in the description below, but goddamn, goddamn.
1859980	1862260	They're gonna be showing up on chat roulette sooner or later.
1862260	1864420	I'm surprised they haven't expanded this approach
1864420	1866500	to their actual TV ads.
1867420	1869860	Have all the Army people parachuting
1869860	1871900	out of the battle bus, and then like...
1871900	1872740	Have you seen the...
1872740	1873980	Where we drop in, Sarge!
1873980	1875740	Have you seen recruitment ads recently?
1875740	1876580	No.
1876580	1877420	It is...
1877420	1879700	They're doing like dances out in the battlefield.
1879700	1883060	It's a, the narrative has changed quite drastically
1883060	1885900	from your parents who have served,
1885900	1886740	and you...
1886740	1887900	It's like being an Army of One, be all that you can be.
1887900	1889500	All of the ads that I've seen recently,
1889500	1891180	and again, this is because I watched a lot of sports,
1891180	1896180	it's because it's the teenager convincing their parent
1896380	1897980	that it's going to be okay.
1897980	1898820	Oh, that's fun.
1898820	1901420	And it's like them on their computer doing
1901420	1904340	some creative field, like doing Blender,
1904340	1906900	or something like that, and being like, you know...
1906900	1907740	I have seen that.
1907740	1909180	There's a company out there that'll pay me
1909180	1911620	to enhance my skills like this,
1911620	1913340	and mom, you don't have to worry,
1913340	1914940	because I'm not gonna die.
1914940	1918740	I'll be safely tucked away in a room somewhere in Virginia
1918740	1922220	where I am able to disconnect from the damage I'm causing.
1922220	1923620	I love this form of recruiting
1923620	1926140	because you don't really have much control
1926140	1930220	at all over what you end up actually doing.
1930220	1931060	It's like...
1931060	1931900	No.
1931900	1933020	And with the eSports thing,
1933020	1935340	it's like you can't enlist in the Army,
1935340	1936180	and be like, all right,
1936180	1938220	so I'm getting sent to the eSports team, right?
1938220	1939260	They're like, no.
1939260	1940940	No, you fucking idiot.
1940940	1944060	That's also a huge pressure tactic that they do.
1944060	1946220	Once it's already, quote unquote, it's not too late,
1946220	1948780	but once it's too late to back out,
1948780	1950860	the whole way through, we'll talk about your position
1950860	1952780	and the exact role that you'll have in the Army,
1952820	1954500	and then they will get on the phone.
1954500	1957620	I swear to God, because I fucking lived through it,
1957620	1958940	they will get on the phone and be like,
1958940	1961020	I don't know, that's a pretty in-demand field.
1961020	1962620	I'm gonna have to run this up the chain
1962620	1964940	and make sure that we can make it available for you.
1964940	1968340	But once my commanding officer gets on that phone,
1968340	1970700	I mean, we're really pulling a lot of strings for you.
1970700	1972340	It's gonna make us look really bad.
1972340	1973820	It's gonna make you look really bad.
1973820	1975500	If you don't, I swear to God,
1975500	1978540	that is exactly what they did to me in high school.
1978540	1979380	Damn.
1979380	1981700	Well, good thing you didn't take the bait.
1981700	1982540	No.
1982540	1985860	I was just making an ad like the old video game college ad,
1985860	1988500	where it's like, what's the next country America's gonna bomb?
1988500	1989460	You haven't bombed it yet.
1989460	1991700	You haven't decided yet.
1991700	1994460	But yeah, look, it's been a pretty heavy episode,
1994460	1996620	but we're gonna end today's show on a lighter note
1996620	1999300	because it feels as though, at least for some people,
1999300	2001540	we have collectively reached the end of capitalism,
2001540	2004300	and the only way to know if you're worth anything at all
2004300	2007300	is to shamelessly brag about how rich you are.
2007300	2008140	Actually, don't do that
2008140	2009820	because you look like a total piece of shit,
2009820	2011740	but that doesn't matter to these people
2011740	2014100	because their narcissism knows no bounds.
2014100	2016780	And there's finally an art installation for them
2016780	2019860	down in Miami's beautiful art basil.
2019860	2024740	Art basil is like the funniest world art event
2024740	2027820	because it pretty much exclusively attracts-
2027820	2028660	The worst people.
2028660	2030660	Like these types of rich assholes.
2030660	2031500	Yes.
2031500	2032860	Like it's less about the art.
2032860	2034940	And even the art that is on display there
2034940	2036700	that I've seen fucking sucks.
2036700	2037540	The banana?
2037540	2039260	It's all just like weird shit
2039740	2042140	that someone has managed to con their way
2042140	2045100	into a certain section of rich people thinking they're cool
2045100	2046740	and like, hey, more power to them,
2046740	2048700	but it's not good looking art.
2048700	2051020	Confidence gets you so fucking far.
2051020	2053420	Yeah, Miami is just a hell of a place.
2053420	2055820	Oh my God, did you see the Miami clubs
2055820	2056660	that are going out of business
2056660	2058020	because they don't have any crypto money coming?
2058020	2060580	Another, it's just like the cocaine boom bust
2060580	2061420	all over again.
2061420	2062260	It really is.
2062260	2064860	When the cart shells, when they finally started
2064860	2067620	intercepting those planes coming in from the Caribbean,
2067660	2071220	a whole ripple effect happened in Miami.
2071220	2074620	Entire industries were no longer able to sustain themselves.
2074620	2075620	It's actually-
2075620	2077780	And now with crypto gone, it's happening again.
2077780	2081820	It is insane that through decades of hard work,
2081820	2085540	Florida has made itself a living experiment
2085540	2090540	for like what America could be if left to its own devices.
2091020	2094220	And specifically, the southern fucking tip of Florida,
2094220	2097420	not counting the keys, is like it's distilled even more.
2097420	2100300	Whereas like, what if everyone was on cocaine?
2100300	2101580	All right, let's try it for like a decade.
2101580	2102420	What if we had-
2102420	2104100	What if everyone, all the crypto weirdos came here?
2104100	2107540	What if giant apartment complexes just never got inspected?
2107540	2110020	Yeah, and we're like literally feet from the ocean.
2110020	2111020	Yeah.
2111020	2112580	It's crazy.
2112580	2115980	But finally, finally because of Art Basel
2115980	2118340	and because of Miami, we have a very real,
2118340	2120500	very truthful dick measuring contest
2120500	2122980	that is available for the whole world to see.
2122980	2126100	Presenting the ATM leaderboard by Mischief.
2126100	2126940	Oh, Mischief.
2127140	2128500	So yeah, this is actual art.
2128500	2131340	They are a brand that specializes in fucking with reality.
2131340	2132660	Yeah.
2132660	2135260	This is an ATM machine where anyone can walk up,
2135260	2137740	scan their debit card and see where they stand
2137740	2140140	against other Art Basel attendees
2140140	2141940	as far as liquidity is concerned.
2141940	2143580	And that's the funniest part about this.
2143580	2145740	Yes, these are all people who are keeping
2146940	2149740	obscene amounts of money in their checking account.
2149740	2150860	In their checking account, which is like
2150860	2153180	the most exposed way possible.
2153180	2155780	It's just like just the most baby-brained way
2155780	2156900	to like store your money.
2156900	2160140	Waving a flag at this fucking art fair.
2160980	2163020	It is quite simply a working ATM
2163020	2165220	with a computerized scoreboard attached.
2165220	2166540	You put your bank card in,
2166540	2168140	withdraw whatever cash you need,
2168140	2169420	and the machine takes a photo of you
2169420	2171780	and adds it along with your name and account balance
2171780	2173140	to a scrolling leaderboard
2173140	2175700	with the person who has the most money on top.
2175700	2177060	As of yesterday, however,
2177060	2179580	Art News reported that since Diplo topped the leaderboard
2179580	2183820	with $3 million, his score has been surpassed twice already.
2183860	2187020	Number two is someone with a $5 million account balance,
2187020	2189540	while number one is $9 million.
2189540	2191060	God only knows why anyone would need
2191060	2192380	that much cash in checking.
2192380	2194100	And that's what I'm saying.
2194100	2194940	Yeah.
2194940	2196420	Why do you need that much liquidity?
2196420	2198660	Because these people are showing off.
2198660	2202380	And I love so much that this outlet
2202380	2205820	refused to name the two people who were at first and second
2205820	2207940	because you know those people are searching
2207940	2209780	every fucking bit of coverage about this
2209780	2211460	to see if there are goddamn names in it.
2211460	2212580	And the fact that they're like,
2212660	2214060	and some fucking weirdo,
2214060	2216580	some guy, random guy, 9 million, big deal.
2216580	2218580	These are all dudes trying to get laid too.
2218580	2219420	Yeah.
2219420	2221220	Like, hey, I need to get money out of the ATM.
2221220	2224140	Hey, did I see you on the leaderboard?
2224140	2228340	It is like the tactic that is as old as time
2228340	2232620	where people will get like their ATM balance or whatever
2232620	2234220	and then like leave it in their wallet
2234220	2235940	or like like it fell out.
2235940	2237620	Yes, this is like a dickhead,
2237620	2240940	like New York's stock exchange guy move from the 80s.
2240940	2245660	Like, but anyways, they do make a good point at the end.
2245660	2247100	And it's a learning moment for anyone
2247100	2248900	who does carry a positive balance,
2248900	2250740	which is increasingly rare in this country,
2250740	2253780	but for anyone who does, first up, great job.
2253780	2255180	You're doing better than a significant portion
2255180	2256020	of the country.
2256020	2258020	Second, don't put all your money in your checking account.
2258020	2259080	No, don't do that.
2259080	2260780	At the very least, keep it in savings.
2260780	2263340	And also if you are a responsible person
2263340	2265340	and only if you are sure
2265340	2267700	that you are a responsible person, check your credit score.
2267700	2270340	You should not use your debit card everywhere.
2270340	2271300	You should use a credit card
2271300	2273300	that you do pay off in full every month.
2273300	2274300	Yeah.
2274300	2277820	It builds credit and it also takes the fraud liability
2277820	2279860	off of your shoulders for the most part.
2279860	2281540	It's you're spending someone else's money,
2281540	2282700	they're gonna fight to get it back.
2282700	2283540	Yeah.
2283540	2286060	When your debit card gets stolen at the gas station,
2286060	2287660	that's on you, buddy.
2287660	2290180	Now, having said all that, there is literally nothing positive
2290180	2292700	that comes from a dick measuring contest at Art Basil.
2292700	2294420	Everyone looks like an asshole,
2294420	2295860	but that's kind of the point.
2295860	2296700	Yeah.
2296700	2298440	And with mischief behind this, that is the point.
2298440	2300220	Yeah, it's an interesting social experiment.
2300260	2301100	Yeah.
2301100	2303860	But speaking of financial responsibility,
2303860	2305860	guess what I got today?
2305860	2308380	My Stadia refund in full.
2308380	2309380	Oh.
2309380	2311940	So everyone's like, oh, let's make fun of Ricky
2311940	2315180	for trying out the new tech for his job with a tech show.
2315180	2317900	Oh, we're gonna mock Ricky incessantly online
2317900	2318860	and make him feel bad.
2318860	2320580	Yeah, exactly, yes.
2320580	2322340	Well, guess what, buddy?
2322340	2323780	Despite having the money held up
2323780	2325560	for however many years it's been,
2325560	2328060	I got a 4K Comcast,
2328060	2330460	a Bluetooth game controller,
2330460	2333060	and my $140 back.
2333060	2335300	Okay, yeah, I mean that, I guess that worked out.
2335300	2336140	Yeah.
2337420	2338860	So, there you go.
2338860	2340460	Don't put your money in a checking account.
2340460	2342720	Put it in Google Stadia where it's safe.
2342720	2344020	Hairbrained products from Google
2344020	2345780	that they're definitely gonna discontinue
2345780	2347140	at the first opportunity.
2347140	2349540	Google did a great job at holding onto that money for me
2349540	2350780	because I would have spent it.
2350780	2351620	Right.
2351620	2352460	I would have spent it.
2352460	2353300	You would have put it in the stock market
2353300	2355140	and have you seen that graph?
2355140	2355980	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2355980	2357340	Do you want Google to hold on your money
2357340	2358500	in its Stadia account,
2358500	2360100	or do you want to put your money into Google
2360100	2361820	and have it vanish in the year 2022?
2361820	2363180	This is why the best way,
2363180	2364880	better than checking or savings,
2364880	2368580	is you just keep all your money in GameStop pre-orders.
2368580	2369420	Yes.
2369420	2370260	You just pre-order everything
2370260	2371100	and when you need money,
2371100	2372380	you go down and you cancel your pre-order,
2372380	2373740	they give you the money.
2373740	2374580	Yes.
2374580	2375420	As far as you can-
2375420	2376260	You don't even need a bank.
2376260	2379660	Literally as far as you can be away from any money you have
2379660	2380980	is the best thing possible.
2380980	2381820	Yeah.
2381820	2382940	There you go.
2382940	2384180	But anyways, I got my money back
2384180	2386060	and I got a free controller and a Chromecast out of it,
2386060	2386900	so fuck you, buddy.
2386940	2388100	Is the controller even like work?
2388100	2389140	It's a Bluetooth.
2389140	2389980	Oh, okay.
2391780	2394140	Would I want to play with it anywhere in public
2394140	2396380	that people would see that I owned a Stadia at one point?
2396380	2397420	Well, now maybe.
2397420	2398620	That's a piece of video game history.
2398620	2399900	It is.
2399900	2402260	Anyways, that's it for today's episode.
2402260	2404020	We do, of course, have more coming up for you
2404020	2405340	and it'll be up soon.

2420500	2421780	It only took us like eight years
2421780	2423580	to finally like actually test it out,
2423580	2425420	but yeah, it actually works.
2425420	2426260	It works.
2426260	2427100	You're doing a wonderful job.
