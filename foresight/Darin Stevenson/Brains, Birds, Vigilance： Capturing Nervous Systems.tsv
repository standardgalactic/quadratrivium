0	15080	Hello everybody. Welcome. I appreciate all of you who listen to my recordings and it
15080	21720	would help me a lot if you subscribe or like them or make a comment or ask a
21720	33160	question. My engagement is embarrassingly minute. So to reach more people, whatever
33160	37680	help you care to lend would be greatly appreciated. But I'm glad you're just
37680	44280	here and that I'm here. We're both still alive. Apparently we're breathing. I'm
44280	53920	crossing urban streets on foot, which is vastly more dangerous than we like to
53920	63240	think. It turns out that although there are many explanations for the complexity
63240	70680	of our human brains, I strongly suspect many of them are either completely
70680	84320	wrong or put the precedents on the wrong thing. Obviously social cognition is one
84320	91160	of them and it would be amazing if we developed complex brains to handle
91160	100640	social cognition. Only to discover that that would cause us to simulate, this is
100640	105000	one of the explanations for human brain complexity, that would cause us to simulate
105000	114160	another which would become the self a fiction. Because similar to one of my
114160	120360	fingers deciding that it is real and the rest of the hand is well whatever that
120360	135000	is, we would become catastrophically misguided thereafter, continue to produce
135000	144480	simulations, as well as representational culture, right, where we with each thing we
144480	158000	lose direct participation and relation with. We form a token and then thereafter
158000	165600	relate with the token instead of resurrecting the relationship and the
165600	175440	participation. And so we end up in an endless thirst trap where the more
175440	180920	representations we make, the more we are suffocating for participation and
180920	188280	meaningful roles and relationships, and this leads to a descending nightmare of
188480	205720	self-amplifying, what is the word, poverty, impoverishment. And this seems to
205720	216200	match up pretty damn good with what I see going on. But the social cognition
216200	223240	argument is powerful, the problem is it leads to an endless cascade of disasters
223240	240840	as we stop relating with and in pod groups in which our identity and purpose
240840	253800	of motivations are useful, celebrated, effective, alive, vital, creative, playful,
253800	261040	joyful, fulfilling, rewarding. You know get together with a team of three people
261040	268360	and do anything meaningful, right. The rewards at the end of the day are off the
268360	279080	scale compared to any possible representation you could form. Yes, this
279080	291720	is all the change I have. The large coin is a dollar. You're welcome. That poor old
291840	303360	woman, my goodness, she must be 70 and she's living on the street. You see what
303360	313840	ends up happening, right, like without meaningful cohorts that are real, our
313840	319680	elderly end up dying alone in boxes or we're still on the street. And what do I
319920	327040	mean by our elderly? Okay, I get the problem with the language. I do. We could just say
327040	336880	the elderly, which we will all become. So that's us in the future. Okay, what else?
336880	347720	Where am I here? Social cognition, meaningful groups, pods. So in our situation,
347760	352840	what's the what's the antidote here? So the first is to teach each other to
352840	361320	understand the representational gambit's foundations, right, which involve the
361320	367680	simulation of a separate self and then the inaction of a separable self that
367680	375840	becomes an isolated self. Ask yourself this question. I'll ask myself the same
375880	385160	question. How many times per month do I directly physically engage meat space
386160	390640	with other humans for meaningful purposes that I trust and are beautiful
390640	396800	and noble? So first of all, how often do I engage with meat space others for
396800	407880	anything? Myself, with a couple of trenchant exceptions, one being somebody I
407880	415920	live with, the number of times per month that happens for me is zero. And that's
415960	428200	part of why I make these videos, because this is a way for me to participate, to
428200	445840	work my vocabulary, which is important because my vocabulary is one of my
445880	451520	as a writer and someone who values articulate intelligent speech. My
451520	458920	vocabulary is crucially important. I've worked hard to develop it over my life,
459920	470080	although it was natural for me to do that because of my interests. And also to
470800	486800	create a context where I'm doing something meaningful in the day to me that
486800	492760	may provide benefit for distance others, some of whom I know, some of whom I love,
493760	503160	many of whom are unknown to me. There's just sort of people who manage to find my
503160	510640	channel. But this is not particularly crucially important to my point. I'm
510640	515800	merely trying to say that ask yourself the question. How often over some
516120	523840	interval, say 90 days, are you able to get together with other humans and enact
523880	530480	your humanity intelligently, creatively, meaningfully for a purpose you believe
530480	540720	in? And even if today in our time, right, circa 2024, that's a virtual get
540720	547520	together. Let's count those. We'll open the aperture from meat space only to
548560	554240	virtual context. But you can see the radical difference, right? Suppose that
557520	562960	I'm just going to pick something incredibly trivial. Three neighbors once a
562960	569760	month get together, wander around their neighborhood together and pick up trash.
571520	579480	Not particularly heroic, but powerful because they're doing something they
579480	585960	believe in and they will communicate and act as a single member, right? Act like a
585960	593240	hand. In fact, they'll literally be picking things up. It's very handlike. And
593240	600680	of course, it turns out that the hand is one of the best metaphors for human
601680	609480	togetherness and unity that you can possibly come up with. It might be the
609480	616760	best because there's there's just there's nothing. It's a part of your
616760	623360	physical body, right? So hello.
628520	636400	It was developed by evolution. So the model is not a human intellectual model.
637400	641440	It's an evolutionary model. It's older than old.
641440	655520	It's a really good model for the actual nature of human existence being
655520	664000	interiority. I noticed that the first thing that happens when you destroy
664000	672200	human social groups is that you get individual fingers attempting to do
672200	681240	things to enact their humanity in ways that require a hand. I'd love to see
681240	688480	any one attempt to use any of our tools. Though, you know, they might succeed with
688480	693600	a few. Try and use pliers with a single finger. I mean, try to do anything with a
693600	698480	single finger. You might be able to sort of play some kind of musical
698480	705520	instrument as long as it didn't require your breath. You could plunk your way
705520	709000	along something with a single finger, presuming that you had a hand that the
709000	714600	finger was on the end of. The way that our systems work is as if they amputate
714600	718880	the fingers and then scream at them for not being able to do all the things that
718880	726560	a hand could do. So obviously what I'm trying to say here is that the
726560	735000	embodiment and fulfillment of our potentials as human beings naturally
735000	748520	requires communion. Potting up. You will see very few intelligent animals
748560	759440	there are exceptions that don't pot up. One exception would be octopuses. The
759440	774040	other polarity are the organisms that form supergroups. These would be creatures
774080	783720	that form hives. Ants, bees, wasps, certain species of spider form
783720	796360	massive web communities. Unclear. It may be that the fundamental problem with our
796360	808680	species is just that we form misguided supergroups. So what was I thinking
808680	818320	originally here? Oh yes. All right.
818760	829040	So we've actually I've actually covered much more ground than I was imagining
829040	840240	when I began my talk and what was inspiring me. Okay so I'm going to circle
840240	852320	way back here. I sometimes form relationships with animals by offering
852320	864880	them food and there are certain animals with which it is less dangerous for
864880	875080	both of us than it would be with others. So for example I am currently in the
875080	881200	San Francisco Botanical Gardens. The coyotes here are reasonably well known
881200	890600	to me. I see them commonly. I could easily form relationships with them by
890600	901760	bringing them some meat. Any transaction between humans and wild things,
901760	909320	especially city humans, will produce a lot of danger for both participants.
909320	919320	Primarily because the human is dumb about what is important for the animals.
920600	925160	Don't know if you heard that. That was a coyote.
927280	932080	Let's see if it, yeah it's yipping.
939800	944080	All right let's examine this problem here.
944080	958320	Okay this is a really good, really good instance of synchronicity.
965480	973040	It's crucial for all animals to avoid danger and one of the ways they avoid
973080	979800	danger is by avoiding calling attention to themselves. There are some situations
979800	989960	under which it is relatively more safe to call attention to oneself and others
989960	999960	under which it's extremely dangerous. There's only one animal here around here
1000000	1009600	that is a threat to the coyote and that's homo sapiens. If I were to begin
1009600	1020120	feeding a coyote and I could delude myself into thinking this is a good way
1020120	1025760	to establish a relationship with them and to nourish that relationship
1025760	1038360	literally, physically. Okay the reason that coyote is calling out at full
1038360	1048880	volume in broad daylight. Very dangerous thing for it to do is that there are
1048880	1061200	sirens. So the humans make a machine that mimics a signal that essentially
1061200	1071600	causes, nearly forces the coyote to reveal its location. I mean if you wanted
1071600	1077560	to hunt coyotes you could just bring a device with you that produced sirens and
1077840	1086600	they would light up their location with calls because they're physically, to some
1086600	1099040	degree, they are physically unable to resist that stimuli.
1108000	1121360	Hi. Now if I were to begin feeding coyotes around here what would naturally
1121360	1133600	happen is that I would interfere with their natural tendency, one might call
1133640	1140680	it, at least around here, to avoid contact with humans. Now if I live, if I were not
1140680	1149480	a city dweller and I lived in the wilderness and I wanted to have a
1149480	1155480	relationship with the coyotes, there are a number of different ways I might go
1155560	1164560	about forming that relationship. Perhaps the most important but least blatant is
1164560	1173680	to imagine that the coyotes form an emissary to the humans and I form an
1173680	1178520	emissary from the humans and in my imagination and perhaps in my dreaming
1179480	1188480	me and the emissary meet and we exchange protections and potencies and
1188480	1198640	medicine and so forth. Humans are unlikely, modern particularly, unlikely to pursue
1198640	1207480	that kind of connection. Many of them would not believe that it's real but
1207520	1214040	that would be a good way and then perhaps I could ask the coyote emissary
1214040	1219400	questions and it could ask me questions and it might even have things to say
1219400	1225440	to my people, things that wished to be communicated to my people about their
1225440	1234480	people and our ancient union because some animals, synanthropes particularly,
1234480	1246080	have had more than a million years of relationship with Homo sapiens and you
1246080	1251800	could say well our species really isn't that old, are you sure? Yes, our species
1251800	1258440	isn't that single age old or it probably is. I don't know what the current model
1258440	1263760	is of our estimated age of Homo sapiens. Probably measured in flat years though
1263760	1270560	which there never were so our age is actually the time since the appearance
1270560	1276160	of Homo sapiens in the in the records so to speak times the number of humans
1276160	1286840	who have lived one year right and for each year we'd have to add age so our
1286840	1291320	actual age and the age of our relationships with synanthropes is
1291360	1304280	absurdly enormous. Bees, ants, wasps, mice, rats, porcupines, possums, skunks,
1304560	1314920	moles, gophers, house cats, house dogs, coyotes, wolves,
1314920	1335560	blue jays, magpies, sparrows, hawks, eagles, raptors, owls, crows and ravens, spiders,
1335560	1344480	all of these are synanthropes, these are creatures that prosper and are used to
1344520	1354920	the proximity of human symbionts, companions. Extended body is the concept
1354920	1365080	here not Darren has crow friends, extended body, I am crow, I am blue jay, I am
1365080	1372960	sparrow, I am spider, these organisms as they interact with me extend my
1373000	1380360	intelligence, they extend my senses dramatically, I will learn things from
1380360	1385760	observing them that are formally impossible for me to discover on my
1385760	1394000	own quote unquote. So in a sense what I'm advocating here is the formulation not
1394040	1404560	merely of a human relational hand-like situation but a very complex hand-like
1404560	1412520	situation involving many non-humans including the non-synanthropes presuming
1412520	1419200	that there is any such thing because synanthropy is a matter of degree, not
1419720	1429880	necessarily, you know, binary polarization either is a synanthrop or isn't.
1429880	1441640	On if you take the planet as a whole and you realize that like your comparator is
1442000	1445600	what we know of time-space
1455640	1460960	so if you take sorry I'm having an actual exchange with synanthropes right now
1460960	1470640	again ironic or synchronous or both
1471640	1481440	if you take as your time-space as your comparator then the earth is basically
1481440	1489400	like a little droplet of water in a vast desert and that droplet there's nothing
1489400	1497040	that isn't synanthropic there because essentially from this perspective from
1497040	1501360	the perspective of time-space toward the earth rather than the earth out you
1501360	1506320	know the human out to nature nature out to time-space which is the perspective
1506320	1515120	we are trained to take by our language and its categorical gambits it's absurd
1515120	1523080	and stupidifying categorical gambit. The whole package of lies that comes along
1523120	1531840	with English courtroom mind war mind anthropocentricity terracentricity all of
1531840	1538040	these things so from from time-space toward earth what you obviously have
1538040	1542440	here and if you're not capable of thinking this way I will argue you're
1542440	1547800	barely capable of thinking at all is what you have here is a single organism
1548240	1554880	that takes many forms now it may turn out to be absolutely a physical fact that
1554880	1565080	that's what you've got here one imagines for example a space faring organism
1565080	1576160	that I'll call starfish it naturally swims between the stars in a proto form
1576440	1582320	that proto form could be incredibly profusely transcendent not merely
1582320	1590080	intelligent and it may only be a cellular form and still be transcendent
1590080	1596000	there's no reason to believe bacteria are probably not
1596000	1604240	representationally intelligent but it's unlikely that we could get the forms of
1604240	1613800	intelligence we're familiar with in human beings without them and so which is
1613800	1621520	superior right is the origin superior or is the results superior well once you
1621520	1627120	decide that one of them has to be superior you're already having courtroom
1627400	1634240	my point is just that it may well be that a single organism was primordial
1634240	1639000	here and that everything that you see that lives on this planet is actually
1639000	1647360	starfish's morphs right morphs of starfish one thing one one organism it
1647360	1658920	may also be that that organ that there were multiple forms of starfish that
1658920	1664440	lived that came here dwelt here there might have been some competition stuff
1664440	1673600	that looks like war but isn't but yeah you got one organism here so you should
1673600	1677240	definitely be able to think that way and you should probably think that way in
1677240	1685320	precedence to thinking oh these are all separate Darwinian Lee competitive
1685320	1692760	morphs that last thing can't be true primarily it's the problem with the
1692760	1698000	idea of competition there's no such thing as competition without symbiosis if
1698000	1707000	you don't have cooperation you don't get forms complex enough to compete so
1707040	1716600	the emphasis on competition is almost certainly a bad move all right if I
1716600	1722920	feed the coyotes in the botanical gardens it will reduce their suspicion
1722920	1731320	and avoidance of humans in general what that will mean in very short order here
1731640	1737680	is that the coyotes I feed will eventually realize ah humans are a source
1737680	1746520	of food food is difficult and dangerous to get here I'm gonna occasionally
1746520	1750600	approach humans some of those humans will have children some of them may have
1750600	1760440	dogs and coyotes will generally see small dogs small coyotes smaller
1760440	1766160	coyotes will see small dogs actually all coyotes will most coyotes will see
1766160	1773360	small dogs as prey that's a that's a good meal that's fairly easy to obtain so
1773360	1780480	they may go after those small dogs and that will result almost certainly in
1780480	1787360	the humans killing them particularly here in the botanical gardens
1798480	1808720	similarly if I feed the blue jays peanuts which they love
1810480	1823800	that signal
1823800	1833880	resembles playing a siren in the territory of coyotes
1840480	1856120	an analogy would be dropping hundred dollar bills along a busy freeway why a
1856120	1868360	busy freeway well for the blue jays many of them live in the hunting territory
1868360	1879440	of hawks and so when I come with my peanuts it doesn't shut off their
1879440	1890040	vigilance their vigilance but it radically reduces it it's funny I have
1890040	1905440	learned to recognize the shadow of the birds that I know so that sometimes I
1905440	1914600	can detect them behind me so if I put peanuts out and if I'm not careful
1914600	1919680	about it and I'm not attentive and I had to learn this by error by making bad
1919720	1929520	mistakes costly mistakes then I'm interfering with their vigilance
1929520	1936640	who's responsibility is it it's not a courtroom this is a communal animal me
1936640	1951520	plus the birds right so I also love the hawks and I have some relationship with
1951520	1962920	them as well but I don't want them to eat my blue jay friends obviously I want
1962920	1974800	them to get fed now all of this is very complex the problem is that I am not
1974800	1989320	aware ordinarily of the environmental relational historical biological
1989720	2000760	necessities of blue jay life or hawk life or coyote life and so if I wander
2000760	2012800	into that stumbling around like a magical thinking human an indictment that I
2012800	2018600	certainly deserve but I'm now beginning to understand in a in a richer way I
2018680	2030920	like to think I'm learning I will cause harm where my goal is to have beneficial
2030920	2039960	relations usually beneficial relations and that will be emotionally painful for
2039960	2056200	me because my desires are not utilitarian I am aware that the animal
2056200	2072720	intelligences including the insects will in a sense make offerings of
2072720	2083160	intelligence dreaming communal identity they will benefit me they will try to
2083160	2091480	figure out what what will benefit the one who is our friend and many of those
2091480	2094720	offerings will not be ordinary it's not like they're gonna bring me cash money
2094720	2101160	though in the case of a representational animal like say a particularly precocious
2101160	2112480	raven such a thing could take place it could bring me objects so if I want to
2112480	2122040	actually honor the relationship I have to to some degree protect the living
2122040	2140400	beings from the rapacious and omnicidal stupidity of my species and also my own
2140440	2150480	ignorance it will be difficult for me to form physical relationships with the
2150480	2158360	coyotes in this garden without feeding them if I feed them it is very likely
2158360	2164320	that will lead to them being shot by parts in Iraq or whoever does animal
2164320	2168520	control whatever parts in Iraq will call animal control will come out and
2168800	2178760	quote-unquote basically need to obliterate them you know more stories of
2178760	2187720	during stupidity so one night I was sitting in my room and out one of my
2187720	2196240	windows I noticed a family of coyotes excuse me a family of raccoons boy
2196280	2207400	here's a if you want to talk about courage motivation intelligence difficulty
2207400	2218720	heroism one pride one standout exemplar of this would be raccoon mothers in
2218720	2226080	urban settings there's no one to babysit the children the children like
2226440	2236720	any children are precocious playful curious very difficult to orient meanwhile
2236720	2242760	this mother has to bring them through places with dogs and cars and broken
2242760	2250640	bottles and poison and every kind of dogs every kind of threat cats you can
2250640	2258080	imagine coyotes every night every night that mother is going to bring their
2258080	2265240	children through a battlefield of things that will kill them and her so one night
2265240	2277200	I'm in my room it's late quiet and I hear the chortling of the of the
2277200	2286640	children naturally stupid as I am and also you know at that point prone to
2286640	2296400	magical thinking I emulate the sound back to them what happens the family of
2296400	2299800	raccoon stops dead in the middle of the street trying to determine the source of
2299800	2308280	that sound meanwhile a car doing 40 miles an hour comes up the street and
2308280	2318280	somehow I think that even though they were in the car's path when it passed I
2318280	2327080	think they all managed to survive unscathed I am not sure one of them
2327080	2331880	might have been struck by the undercarriage of the car however if that
2331880	2336400	were true there should have been a dead raccoon nearby in the morning probably
2336400	2348080	baby in any case if you want to imagine me cringing to the core of my being for
2348080	2360680	a moment you know I thought I was being playful and human and intelligent and
2360680	2366960	recognizing them and relating with them what I did not realize is they are on a
2366960	2374680	street there is traffic in the street this is why I made the metaphor of dropping
2374680	2384920	$100 bills on the freeway when I put out peanuts for the blue jays I had best be
2384920	2391400	complicit in their survival concerns vigilance protocols I had best
2391400	2398360	understand something deep about these because if I don't I am I am giving
2398360	2407200	them an irresistible stimulus in a terrain where there are hawks not only
2407200	2418320	that there are most likely nearly all of these would be males by the way case you
2418320	2422960	think gender doesn't matter there are most likely people who would kill the
2422960	2428000	blue jays for fun so once they learned for example that you could bring a blue
2428000	2441640	jay to your hand with a peanut they would do so for nefarious purposes the
2441640	2451640	other day I was in a part of the garden where there's a scrub jay that knows me
2452080	2463960	by the way that jay remembered me I fed it one time like five years ago and that
2463960	2471400	jay remembered me every time it saw me thereafter the animals have their
2471400	2477240	memories are unencumbered by representation so they have a lot of
2477520	2488760	memory resource to enact it's funny what a long road it's taking me to get back
2488760	2502200	to my original motivational thought here that started this this topic so for some
2502240	2519000	birds the appearance of a peanut is so compelling that they become like their
2519000	2526320	nervous system actually divides against itself and their ordinary instincts
2526320	2534960	for self and companion protection at least briefly collapse into must get
2534960	2546640	that peanut before something else does and so this messes up their vigilance
2546880	2559920	activities now a brief you know a brief
2563680	2573520	divergence from protocol probably won't get you killed at least not the first time
2577600	2586120	oh yeah see I was just feeding them and a hawk has come one of the coopers has
2586120	2598480	come to see oh it was turned away from you know it's hunting I respect that hawk
2598880	2610720	and have felt its talons because again ignorance got in trouble with the hawks
2610720	2619920	so there are some kinds of stimulus and you know the humans have the same problem this
2619920	2628480	is why social media has become a terrifying this manipulative disease you can see that
2628480	2634000	the goal is to capture attention which has for some time been the new form of cash
2635680	2642880	and this is natural for an organism that's collapsing away from participatory relation
2643840	2651360	meaningful roles and relationships into representations money porn social media
2652160	2665520	shows video games etc the coyote can't help it it's not powerless but it's nearly powerless
2665520	2673120	when the siren is near it directly captures its nervous system and this is what happens to us
2673920	2678400	with our technologies we undergo nervous system capture
2680720	2686960	now there's a blue jay in a part of the garden that remembers me from a long time ago a couple
2686960	2700080	weeks ago I was I gave it a peanut and because it's a male and it knows me it will come to my hand
2700960	2708960	now by the way that's a particularly interesting situation let me explain why
2709760	2718080	if I put the peanut on the ground or on a branch the jay must do if it wants to live
2719040	2730560	it's going to check maybe between eight and 30 vectors before it moves and then when it lands
2730560	2736160	it will recheck those vectors ordinarily the jay will have a companion up high
2737120	2741760	they can directly check with to see if it can't if there's something it can't see yet
2744160	2755440	and this complex participated relationship of mutual positive vigilance keeps both jays safe
2758720	2759600	relatively well
2760160	2774480	now if instead I am aware that there's a male and the male knows me I hold out a peanut in my hand
2777600	2786160	the male can be relatively certain that it can cross the interval between its perch and my palm
2786720	2790400	safely because it's a very short interval and it's fast
2792960	2801840	and grabbing the peanut from my outstretched hand it doesn't have to do a bunch of vector checking
2803040	2813760	because a hawk is very unlikely to attempt to take a jay from a human palm
2816560	2826960	unless the hawk has previously succeeded at such an endeavor so in a way the male's
2828240	2829760	willingness to come to my hand
2832320	2833440	is a bit more safe
2841280	2842400	than coming to ground
2847120	2853760	huh what's she shooting oh I see sparrows are eating seeds in a bush
2855520	2857440	interesting that we call photography shooting
2861120	2863360	leads to a whole other conversation wherein
2867840	2873200	human vision is understood to be a complex series of rays
2873600	2882880	that travel out from the eye bouncing back from the things these rays touch
2887280	2892560	so in a sense the male that comes to my hand is fairly safe
2894480	2898720	and as long as such interactions between me and the birds are infrequent
2903200	2910320	it's unlikely to produce their death unless there's something wrong with the peanuts
2912480	2917520	or conceivably but awfully unlikely
2920880	2925920	they acquire some microbe from my skin surface or something
2926320	2934720	so I was feeding this this male and there were a couple of men approaching and they saw the
2934720	2945280	bird come to my hand and they said uh do you speak with birds and I playfully said doesn't everyone
2945520	2956240	laugh and made some comment like well I don't I don't see the birds coming to the hands of people
2957120	2963040	here's a male scrub jay that knows me so now I will do the thing that I was just talking about
2963040	2970960	where the bird comes to hand and he lands briefly on my hand when he grabs the peanut now if there's
2970960	2979520	a female around I can put I'll usually put a peanut out for her
2987920	2991680	so that she can also have the benefit of
2992400	3002160	what a birder I know called bird heroine which he meant peanuts so yeah the guys said said this to me
3003120	3006960	and I said well
3011520	3014480	peanut is a language understood by many birds
3016800	3017680	and they laughed
3021760	3022560	so
3026560	3031360	you know the humans do some degree of monkey see monkey do
3033760	3040400	so additionally if I'm out in public and I'm witnessed relating with animals by giving them food
3041200	3047360	creates problems very unlikely that other humans are even
3047840	3054960	even similarly sensitive to the well-being of the creatures that I am and I've made terrible mistakes
3056400	3061680	not on purpose so yeah I put some in danger
3065280	3068800	and what I was thinking when I began this walk and talk was
3070880	3074960	there's some crows that know me and
3078240	3082400	when I'm near them when I'm near their their terrain
3084640	3086720	they group up and follow me
3091440	3092720	and people might see this
3095120	3101760	and I wonder what they would think if they noticed I mean I often wonder if people think actually at
3101760	3109520	all but I wonder what they would think if they saw you know five crows following me up
3109520	3118160	up or down some street in the city and I thought that they might think I'm a witch
3118960	3128960	human's naturally
3131600	3137200	surveil each other and they do so sometimes in obvious ways and sometimes surreptitiously
3138800	3142080	I was just being surveyed surveilled by a male in the garden
3142720	3150480	so yeah I wonder what the humans might think but the thing that I find interesting is that
3151520	3156720	there's a very clear pecking order in the group of approximately five crows
3158640	3165760	that know me well and I give them peanuts sometimes
3166080	3172880	so they know that I am
3175520	3183840	I'm gonna bring them something good to eat and it's winter harder to get food colder need more
3184880	3192160	need more fuel it's very it's relatively easy to discern the genders
3193120	3196160	in the corvids behaviorally
3199360	3201600	I have almost never seen if ever
3206880	3209840	a female who's relatively adventurous and aggressive
3214400	3219600	whereas the males the males will come right down and grab a peanut and
3220480	3225040	they won't merely grab a peanut they'll check the other peanuts they'll like do a weight test
3225040	3230480	they'll try to figure out which peanut is best so they might pick up with their beaks three or four
3230480	3237360	peanuts before the females even get near the food and
3242400	3248320	so that creates a problem where it's difficult to get a peanut to the females at all
3250560	3256240	um the male crows have a craw so that they can
3259040	3267440	store one probably one peanut maybe two if we're talking raven
3267840	3269280	um
3271440	3271840	and
3276480	3279680	so they can grab up you know most of the peanuts
3281200	3284880	and and the females are so timid in in this particular group
3287680	3292960	that although they may land near where the males are grabbing peanuts
3293760	3302160	and they may make some tentative passes toward peanuts um what you will notice
3304400	3310000	with crows and ravens is they have a complex neurological behavior where
3312640	3317520	they all make a pass at something they intend to grab and then bounce
3318480	3324160	right like leap backward leap away they'll make a pass towards something and leap away from it
3324880	3328640	and when they grab something they'll leap away from from it even though they've got it
3330880	3338880	and this seems to be a what humans call an instinctual behavior most corvids share it
3339520	3344000	I imagine I haven't seen all the different kinds of corvids I've rarely been able to
3344080	3350240	observe magpies um I think I've seen one in my life for a few minutes in real life
3351200	3356240	though I have sometimes observed them in video by the way there's a bunch of
3357920	3360000	so convocation of crows
3362240	3363760	and they seem stirred up
3374080	3381520	yes I am speaking of your people please do not poop right on my head
3391120	3394800	so interesting the foreground background feature of vision because
3395600	3398320	in the foreground I see the crows and in the background there's these
3398320	3401440	like
3403760	3407600	visually challenging puffs of cloud
3410240	3417040	that what I mean by visually challenging is that they
3419440	3422560	if you look at one area of the cloud forms
3424480	3425840	the others seem
3428320	3430080	the others
3435120	3443360	could almost be in motion the kind of motion that one sees in anything in the foveal vision
3444240	3452560	under the influence of psychedelics this kind of internal efflorescing outward
3453040	3457200	like transformational non-motion
3460720	3469520	that envision probably due to forms of neural feedback still things appear to be moving
3470160	3475440	the whole context may appear to be breathing so forth so the clouds are kind of
3476400	3478720	um relevant with this
3480960	3488400	interior spirit or energy although I am not under the influence of any drugs at the moment
3489840	3492800	unless you consider peanuts a drug I did eat a couple
3497360	3504560	so it's hard to get peanuts to the crow girls and I have a natural
3505920	3506560	um
3509440	3510160	tropism
3518960	3528000	for the underdog for the little one for the rejected one for the outsider so forth
3528960	3531600	so
3533840	3540560	I remember one beautiful afternoon fairly safe this this I think where I walked to the ocean
3540560	3546720	after not having seen it in many many years and I brought some peanuts with me and it turned out
3546720	3555840	that when I got there I encountered an enclave of ravens and so first thing I think I did
3556400	3559040	I'm not really sure actually which thing came first let me be
3560080	3566000	we speak with integrity about this I'm not sure I may have given them peanuts first
3567120	3569680	I may have sang to them first
3573680	3581840	but both things were offerings of respect and uh honoring them
3581840	3592800	honoring their people and their spirit honoring our communal
3603360	3604080	relationship
3604080	3614640	and I remember that there was one raven
3621120	3624320	it's funny how emotionally effective
3626160	3631440	a affect effective this is for me affect
3634080	3637040	when I remember this I'm starting to choke up
3641120	3642320	there was one raven
3647760	3654800	there might have been a few ravens that I could visibly detect ticks around their eyes
3654800	3660480	but there was one raven who its eyes were surrounded with ticks
3661120	3669280	and if you've ever watched young young crows and ravens
3672240	3676160	you will commonly see brother and sister pairs preening each other
3677440	3681280	and maybe brother and brother pairs maybe sister and sister pairs
3682960	3688960	I don't know how common it is that a clutch produces one male and one female
3690480	3695680	but you will see them preening each other
3696720	3700080	right they will come very close together on a telephone wire or something
3701200	3704560	and they will preen each other or one of them will preen the other and they will
3704560	3707760	request you can see them request preening
3710800	3716400	and I knew as I was looking at the raven with all of the ticks
3717360	3722400	that it was not treated well by the rest of the
3724000	3727200	they can be very mean in their in their social pods
3728240	3731040	corvids well the crows and the ravens at least
3736800	3740240	if the jays form extended communities I've not seen them
3746560	3751760	I know that magpies seem to but what I realized when looking at the the raven was
3754880	3759120	first of all obviously this bird is not being preened
3761200	3764400	and it cannot remove the ticks but any other creature could
3767840	3774880	any of those jays any any of those ravens excuse me could have preened it
3776720	3785040	and they would have received a tasty nutritious insect meal by so new me
3785840	3789680	at least you know in my thinking confused as it may be
3796320	3802720	so I worked extra hard to make sure that raven got some peanuts
3806800	3815200	and having fed them and sung to them I walked up the
3818800	3830480	I walked up the shoreline where was I walking north I guess I can't remember probably
3830800	3836480	I walked up the shoreline and I acquired an entourage of ravens
3843840	3850320	so either you know if someone were watching me they would either think this is a magically potent
3850320	3860160	person very few people would think that or they would wonder why they wouldn't have a conjecture
3860160	3867200	they just wonder what the hell is going on here or they would intelligently infer that I had given
3867200	3885680	them food it's pretty hard to get a peanut to the girls in the little crow enclave
3886640	3888960	but what I noticed the other day that I thought was great
3890560	3897120	was that it appeared to me that one of the males cashed a peanut in his
3897440	3898960	his claw
3902480	3906480	and then when the other crows weren't on the ground
3910560	3915760	exuded the peanut for the bird that I imagined to be his sister
3916800	3922960	or could be his mate to consume and I thought that was really cool
3928080	3936160	you know I life is very challenging and difficult and much more so in a world filled with machines
3939840	3948640	and perhaps somewhat naively I believe I'm an extreme altruist an exalt
3948880	3956800	um in Andrea Kuzhevsky's nomenclature
3959840	3966400	I generally will travel in the direction of mutual benefit naturally
3968240	3976880	in any way that I can understand how to do so my heart is more intelligent than my brain at this
3979520	3984880	time much more intelligent and so I get confused by my thoughts
3995520	3997840	often I make mistakes
4003680	4006960	there's an explanation for the complexity of the human brain that I prefer
4009040	4015600	which is that we might not be the alpha symbiont
4017680	4024320	and what I mean by that is something really weird I don't mean the symbiont that dominates
4025520	4032560	overall others or is the most important I mean the symbiont
4033280	4041360	that naturally becomes the summation lens of all of the other intelligences around it
4042400	4047840	all the forms of intelligence produced by starfish fungal microbial
4050000	4058080	vegetal animal land creatures water creatures air creatures living place being skybeam
4059040	4063360	all these intelligences and
4067680	4070400	you know I think the humans have this role
4073520	4087920	there's a bunch of very intense child signaling going on there
4088480	4091920	so
4095920	4100880	pause for a moment here while a loud noise doesn't get recorded
4103600	4114000	it seems to me that I've said this before in a very real sense the human species is the
4114240	4117120	the arbiter
4120320	4131040	of the well-being or destruction of everything that isn't too small for us to see and much of what is
4134640	4135840	so whether or not
4136000	4144240	some creator god divinely mandated that we were the shepherds for life on earth
4145520	4153440	it turns out to be the case by fiat or by uh by function anyway
4153680	4172000	now I think there are other similar alpha symbionts like us on earth
4173920	4180480	and some of the microbial ones might be far more profound in the scope of their
4181440	4184800	relationships than we tend to be
4194480	4206720	clearly in the waters the whales and dolphins represent living summation lenses of the aquatic
4207680	4208720	intelligences
4214000	4219760	how ironic the humans would slaughter them thereby denying themselves access to those organs of
4219760	4227200	intelligence perception and relation for what for the commodities their dead bodies produce
4227200	4236000	those are so worth pennies on the trillions of dollars of what is being disposed of as
4236080	4239200	usual for humans trapped in representational cognition
4242800	4247280	but yes our form has incredible unique
4249280	4258800	monumentally profound faculties and abilities that are disposed of almost entirely by our
4258800	4263280	representational behavior cognition
4268320	4273280	our great forgetting our our amnesia
4276480	4278800	our actively self-generating amnesia
4289760	4294560	so I like to think that
4299680	4307360	the complexity of the physical organ that we refer to as our brains pretending it's
4307440	4311200	distinct again pretending that
4314880	4321200	obvious it should be blatantly obvious that again one organism first the singularity of
4321200	4325520	the organism has precedence to any organ by many orders of magnitude so that
4329680	4335760	if you say the word brain you're actually referring to the entire body and the extended
4335840	4341600	environmental relationships and the entire history of life on earth and the
4343760	4346160	potential and future of life on this planet
4348880	4352480	because there is no brain without a heart you don't have a brain without kidneys
4353120	4356320	no skin no brain no mouth no brain
4360320	4363280	there are certain organs you can do away with and still have a brain
4363440	4366080	but not most of them
4368640	4376640	and the humans are doing the same damn thing to the earth right they are they are ripping the
4376640	4383520	organs of the earth out selling them on the black market for cars and guns and bombs and
4383520	4389760	shit and terror and torture and cages and awfulness the species
4393680	4396640	can't tell if this guy's yelling at himself or if he's yelling at his phone
4402880	4408480	so yeah I mean if the earth is a single animal and the humans are an organ of that animal
4410080	4412720	they are an organ destroying organ of that animal
4414960	4418400	most of us have no desire to be anything resembling that
4419280	4428800	and ordinarily we would have a fairly minimal and perhaps relatively net positive effect
4430080	4438720	on the biosphere and the environment particularly if our population were limited
4439520	4448720	but also if the object population that we produce were dramatically limited
4451040	4451920	this is interesting
4459600	4464000	many people complain about the human population certainly it's a problem
4464560	4471120	but the actual problem seems to me not to be the number of human bodies but rather what the masses
4471120	4477920	of them tend to do and one of those things is madly proliferate objects
4481360	4487520	and thus create from living beings and places effectively garbage and machines
4488080	4497440	so I think there's another explanation for the complexity of our brains
4498080	4506560	which is that the meta organism that earth is naturally produces in her organs
4507120	4522800	complex meta symbionts capable of astonishing feats of symbiotic sensing relation cognition
4522800	4533760	participation so forth and the more of those the earth has the the more alive her own
4537440	4544160	this creates webs of jewels in the net of her transcendentions
4546800	4556160	expanding it dramatically to whatever degree those meta metacognitives and meta symbionts
4557120	4566240	uh remain true to the beautiful and noble and heroic missions of living beings
4567440	4570080	on a delicate world in time space
4573200	4577280	there's a my foot there's a little plastic elephant
4577440	4585280	or maybe it's a pig
4588800	4593760	I wonder how many billions of those we've produced while the elephants and pigs were slaughtered
4595360	4602320	you know at the species level we are deadly poisoned to living worlds presently in our in
4602400	4610720	our current whatever is orienting our groups is malignant fundamentally malignant and life
4610720	4617680	despising intelligence despising because any intelligence that tears itself to shreds must
4617680	4628480	fail to qualify and similarly any intelligence that attacks its own foundations in relation
4628480	4637040	and organism must fail to qualify it's not clear at all individual humans are can be relatively
4637040	4646240	intelligent small groups of bonded humans can be preternaturally intelligent but large disoriented
4646240	4652800	cohorts of humans tend to be omnicidal in our time and that's a game with a short future
4652960	4659680	so one thing that I want to encourage you to do and I'm going to try and take my
4659680	4663680	own advice here is get together with a small group of other intelligent humans
4665200	4674320	and come up with a mission that you all believe in and go on have that adventure together in the
4674320	4684640	living world very hard to emulate that sound
4689680	4694320	it's funny there's there's ravens right above me
4697280	4702640	and one has to wonder if right if this is accidental
4704320	4714640	so
4716240	4720640	it's a pair
4721120	4730320	now I can't tell what their signals mean so I can't really tell
4733680	4734960	if they're upset
4737840	4738960	right I can't really tell
4741200	4746800	if they're upset at my behavior I've been circling a tree if they're curious
4747680	4751040	or something else
4757600	4762320	if we want to experience the potentials of our intelligence our dreaming aspects
4764000	4766160	our transcendence as human beings
4769680	4773120	there are paths where this can be pursued in isolation
4773200	4778880	but if you want an accelerant
4783760	4800080	go with trusted others into adventure meaningful relation meaningful roles nick names private lexicons
4800560	4809360	explore the palm that unites the fingers and you will never be disappointed
4810000	4816000	you might have misadventures things may go wrong but even from those you will learn
4817600	4828880	very profoundly and quickly and you will develop new senses new abilities new perspectives
4831040	4834160	so it turns out the guy that was yelling nearby is yelling into his phone
4839360	4847440	I wish you beautiful lives and ways companions adventures love and play and creativity
4850480	4858640	and I look forward to learning together again very soon thank you for joining me bye bye for now
4860080	4860640	you
