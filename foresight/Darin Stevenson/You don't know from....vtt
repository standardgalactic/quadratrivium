00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Hello, everybody. Welcome.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
I've been listening to

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Danny Jones

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
interviewing Neil from

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Nossom Performance. I can't recall his last name at the moment.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
It's like, Sendiac. Sendlak.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Something like this. Fairly interesting.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
And this is obviously one of the things

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
that's going on with Danny's podcast at the moment, Concrete,

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
is that clearly he's exploring the

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
world around Amen

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Hillman.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
And

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Neil has a lot of interesting historical

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
perspective and information. Neil is an

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
autodidact. He was not educated like me.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
He's a self-educating person. He follows his passions

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
and his interests. And he became interested in these

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
topics through what he called

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
studying his way out of Christianity, which is a very interesting

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
thing to say.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
There's a lot of good information.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Neil is very supportive of Amen's

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
classicism,

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
his Greek scholarship.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
One of the things that Neil says is that most of the people that are attacking

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Amen's

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
perspectives, I will call them.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Just basically attack it from the place of, we'll know

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
the agreed upon knowledge,

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
right? The, let's call it,

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
consensus.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
By the way, that's basically just like saying with

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
the numbers, with the census.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
And this is the adpopulus,

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
historical fallacy. Well, most people think, who gives a flying

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
poop storm what most people think?

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Let's be really clear. If we go with generalities

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
and generalizations, we're only going to miss

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
everything important.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Because what will be overlooked is everything that

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
opposes popular consensus.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
And in our situation with the moderns,

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
the educational level of the common people,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
if we,

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
how would I put this? If we adulterate

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
the pool with

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
the entire scope

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
of the numbers, we're going to find

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
and we got to include people who are so old their memory doesn't

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
work yet. We also have to include children and stuff who have

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
no formal education speak of or not much

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
yet. So if we

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
dilute the numbers with the common

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
people, what you get is basically just stupidity.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Like bald

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
inveterate ignorance.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Which you can see very commonly in the United States

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
in our political situation. You have two species

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
of catastrophic stupidity, you know,

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
assembling golems in public to war against each other

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
for the sake of what? Who has nothing to do with running a country,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
I'll put it that way. It has a lot to do with lining pockets

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
and

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
sustaining lineages of socio-political

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
economic war, prison,

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
you know, power, back room power

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
exchanges.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
The currying of favor and favor trading

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
and so on, which is the opposite of what a democracy

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
should be about.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
In any case, one of the things that was bothering me is that

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
both Neil and Danny

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
with all due respect, Danny is

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
catastrophically naive about anything relating

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
to spirituality. I'm pretty sure

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
he's an atheist and

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
it's, you know, Danny asks

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Neil if he's religious and he just says anything but.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
So Neil is also

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
hopefully my wind buffer is going to work here. I did test it a bit.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
So Neil is also

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
what? I'm not going to say he's an atheist.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
As far as I can tell, he's anti-metaphysical.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
He doesn't believe there's anything like souls or spirits or gods

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
or diamonds or angels or anything.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
And, you know, I'm reminded

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
of experts on fishing

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
who've never held a rod.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
And this analogy turns out to be really important here in all kinds of ways.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
They've never seen a fish. They live in the

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
desert. They don't believe in fishes. Fishes are a

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
story that crazy people tell.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
And the crazy people are so insane

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
that these desert dwellers, and these aren't like the

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Bedouins who actually have wisdom and stuff. These are idiots.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
These are people who live in a world of their own suppositions.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
No experience of the things that they speak of. This is what I was talking about in my

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
recording about knowledge and writing and the problem that

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
that produces. It also produces amazing

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
possibilities of learning and the exchange of

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
the transfer of knowledge on a broader scope than person to person

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
by song and oral tradition and transfer. That's true.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
It does do that, but it comes with very lethal dangers.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Historically the humans tend to ignore the dangers of their new technologies

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
and then what happens is

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
the structures of power,

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
the under structure,

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
the sort of malignant under structures

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
of power and wealth

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
and rape and torture and lying and

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
not the good kind of lying, not the aurea.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
No, no, the kind

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
of lying that leads to the immiseration of

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
thousands or millions of people over epochs of time, that kind

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
of lying. This all gets supported by this process.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
What we have here are people, I can't really speak much about

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Danny Jones, and it's not my intent to insult him

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
or to be disrespectful

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
but it's clear just from listening to him

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
he sounds like an 11 year old kid

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
knowing absolutely nothing about the topic

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
and look, he's interviewed a good, I don't know what his numbers are

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
but a good probably 500 or 1000 people

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
very deep minds, very rich

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
in intelligence. Strangely

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
his own intellect appears

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
largely immune to these intelligences

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
and I find it tragic

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
this is the problem with the claim

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
of knowledge, these people are talking

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
I don't care what they believe and they're welcome to believe

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
whatever they like or disbelieve whatever they like

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
they're talking about things they have no experience of

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
just like people in the desert who make up stories and say

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
there's these people in the west

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
and they say that you can go to the end of the world and if you go there you will see the great water

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
that fills the whole horizon, those people are insane

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
it's not possible for there to be great waters like that

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
there's no chance of it being true

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
water as far as you can see to the horizon

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
all the way around you, those people are doing, those are drunkards

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
and silly people, they're just making shit up

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
which is effectively what they're saying

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
they're saying Neil studies

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
the origins of religion

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
and he's an interesting cat

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
and he has a lot of name based

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
date based, place based, he's got this sort of

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
like you see on those detective shows where you, there's a wall

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
where all of the sort of major players and situations

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
and the timeline is there and there's a web of red threads

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
between all the stuff, Neil's mind is a bit like this

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
which is super cool, I mean for all it's worth

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
in terms of trying to understand

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
classicism

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
what happened in the ancient world, how did, where did we get

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
did the Masoretic text come before the Greek

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
Septuagint or vice versa and why and so forth

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
and

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Neil's defending Amin primarily by saying that

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
his detractors cite

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
consensus, well the consensus is obviously that

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
Masoretic text precedes the Greek, but when you look at the actual numbers

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
at least

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
from some of the people that Neil has been interviewing, some of whom are

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
lifelong scholars of these matters, so not trivial

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
idiots, you know, who, these aren't political theorists

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
who, I think, you know, nope, it's nothing like that

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
these are people who have spent their entire lifetime studying

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
in the archives and in universities and all around the world

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
some of them are probably even in the Vatican libraries

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
which must be catastrophically astonishing

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
um

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
many of these people think

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
that we should ask questions

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
about the texts

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
and their origins, so he's defending some of what

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
Amin is saying and also by saying

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
that the people who are trying, you know, by saying that the people who are trying to

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
refute Amin are not citing much

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
they're really just saying well the consensus has long been

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
particularly if you see on YouTube some ridiculously

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
titled video, Amin Hillman debunked

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
well what a load of bullshit that is, there's no debunking of Amin

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
first of all you can't debunk a human being, let's just be really clear, Amin Hillman exists

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
so, you know, the text is already

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
stupidifyingly

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
pitifully titled, just insane

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
you can't debunk a human being, Amin Hillman debunked

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
what are you debunking, you're debunking your own intelligence in language

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
so what you can debunk is a claim

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
not a human being, let's be really clear about that

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
that little 10 minute video, can't recall

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
don't even care to recall, the name of the guy who

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
obviously a friend of Dan McClellands who

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
has his panties in a bunch about Hillman

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
and I would argue doesn't even understand, has no chance of understanding

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
what Hillman is doing because what Hillman is doing

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
isn't history of religion

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
it's related, it's related

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
and it has an influence in that domain

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
but what Hillman is doing is

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
magical, it's not scholarly

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
there's features of it that are academic and scholarly, he's drawing on his

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
education as a classicist and his fascinations

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
particularly with ancient Greek

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
Galen, known as others

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
everywhere there's these machines

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
even in the park, the gardens

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
driving machines around, in any case

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
what Hillman is doing

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
is initiatory

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
he's time traveling, it's like he's opening up

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
a window to a lost world

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
inside himself, he's opening up this window, this portal

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
if you will, and he's transporting us back

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
he's giving us a

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
there must be a word for this where

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
where you are in time is flipped around

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
in exchange for another place in time

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
that's what Hillman is up to

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
in his

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
paramaniacal

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
dissertations

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
and the actual origins

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
of what's in the Bible, particularly the New Testament

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
but not merely that

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
and

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
you know

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
Hillman's been accused of various kinds of nefarious activities

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
I don't know

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
what the verity of those activities might be

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
basically

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
he was specifically accused apparently by some

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
feature of the Catholic church

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
of summoning demons

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
opening portals

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
he's definitely opening portals

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
he's trying to understand

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
he's trying to understand

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
he's trying to understand

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
what the origins of the often absurdly

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
ridiculous things we believe in modernity

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
he's trying to understand

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
the history of these situations

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
and when he uses the word history

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
he doesn't mean a record of what happened

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
he means to inquire of those with actual knowledge

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
intimate knowledge

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
the kind of knowledge you have of your lover's mouth when you kiss them

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
that kind of knowledge

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
the kind of knowledge you have of a fruit when you eat it

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
direct, somatic, visceral

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
spiritual, originary experience

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
not thinking, not opinions

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
not ideas

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
and he doesn't give a flying fuck about consensus

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
nothing does not care

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
in fact he will blatantly declare

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
that this consensus thing

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
is completely delusional

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
nothing there at all

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
he often yells, he will yell out

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
everything you think

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
all those thoughts you have, all those ideas, all those stuff you've been taught

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
all of that nonsense

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
and then he'll go off camera and you'll hear spanking sounds

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
at least

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
now look

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
nobody has to authorize

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
Hillman, right? you don't have to bow to him

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
he's not running around saying worship me, I am the truth and the light

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
what he's saying is if you want a taste

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
of the ancient world that's much more like

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
what was almost certainly going on than what you've been told

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
we will go together

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
using the ancient greek as a vehicle of travel

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
travel in what? travel

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
in pneumaticon

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
in the freens

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
in the strands

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
the threads, the tributaries

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
of our own origins, our minds, our consciousness

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
our awareness, our souls

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
the spectral body, the soma pneumaticon of the greeks

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
he will spin that up

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
and take us far beyond

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
anything we've ever been exposed to

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
for those who want to go

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
it's an opt-in thing

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
he's not telling the world what to believe or the scholars

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
but he will openly laugh at them

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
and, you know, piss in their faces

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
happily, joyfully, playfully

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
what they've been trained to think

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
they're doing the same

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
kind of thing that they like to accuse him of

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
they're very selectively picking certain senses

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
of certain words that match up not with history

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
not with the consensus of primary sources

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
which consensus Hillman may well

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
theorize. No, they are doing the same thing

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
they're excluding what they don't want to hear

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
why did Hillman have to exclude all references to recreational drugs from his dissertation

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
when the use of drugs by the Romans

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
was probably the primary focus of his PhD dissertation

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
why was he told to exclude these

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
because it was said by the gatekeepers

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
of the institution the Romans would not do this

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
what? What? The Romans were doing this

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
of course they were doing this, we do this, every people who have ever lived

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
have done this

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
and what is this? We use intoxicants

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
and sometimes psychedelics and other sedatives

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
and other things

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
but if you experience anesthesia in the surgery

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
this is what he's talking about

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
so

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
his detractors are doing the same thing

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
they're promoting specific

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
senses of words in Greek

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
and or Hebrew

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
and they are ignoring

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
the senses that don't agree with their pre-existing narratives and biases

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
many of which are ridiculously

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
it's the right word, McDonaldized

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
right? Jack in the Bible

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
eyesed

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
so

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
frankly I think it's weird

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
when people like Danny

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
opine on religious topics

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
or metaphysical topics

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
I don't know his whole history, I don't pay a lot of attention to him

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
but if he has any direct experience of metaphysical

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
the world outside what you are thinking with your representational cognition

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
which let's face it is 99% of the universe

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
point 999

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
basically everything isn't what you like to think

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
is the truth of reality

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
that which is, we might call it, all that is

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
and Danny's over there trying to think his way through that

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
good luck Dan, you're using the fingernail

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
of your pinky for something that needs to become

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
the palm of your hand and replace your representational

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
cognition for you to understand it

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
they're literally arguing about people being possessed

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
and laughing about it, him and Neil, neither of whom apparently believe

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
in possession which I think is hilarious because

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
clearly, Amen

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
it seems very clear to me and I'd love to ask him questions

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
about this but if Amen himself has not experienced

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
various kinds of possession particularly by his muse

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
the

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
dead girl he talks about when he says he has a cheat

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
in the sacred

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
the podcast by quote

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
speaks, unquote, when he talks about

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
this dead girl who resurrects the ancients before

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
him one by one so that he may inquire directly of

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
them, if he's not experiencing something resembling

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
possession I'd love to know what it is that he is

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
experiencing and these two

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
young men who know nothing of what they're talking about

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
apparently and by the way, you know, you can disbelieve

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
something to such a degree that it either kills

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
you or blinds you, right, in the same way that you can believe something

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
to such a degree that it kills you or blinds you, you can disbelieve that food is nourishing

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
and die of intonation, right, you can disbelieve that you need

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
water, you don't need water, dead, you know

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
34 days later, if not sooner

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
you can say, there's no objective evidence for love, that's just something

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
people made up to amuse themselves, okay, you won't

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
have any experience of love, there are certain features of being

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
human and I would argue that many if not most of the features

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
of being human are like this, where if you

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
decide that they don't exist, you become incapable

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
of participating in them, right, and

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
unless something comes and overwhelms

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
your

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
your blatant ignorance

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
your, it's a word I'm looking for that I can't quite find

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
unless something comes and just overwhelms

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
you, right, and takes you over, which by the way is pretty much

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
and I'm not recommending the use of psychedelic drugs here, but that's what happens when one does

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
psychedelic drugs, you don't either nothing happens

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
which is what happened to me the first eight or nine times

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
I smoked weed, nothing, nothing happened, similarly

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
my friend Alan Steinfeld when we were talking the other day, he was like, you know the first

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
time I looked at a television it was just incoherent, I couldn't tell what the hell

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
that was or what was going on there, and he's right

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
it's because the form of our cognition

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
this idea that

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
the crazy people have

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
that what your mind reveals to you is what exists

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
and what it doesn't reveal doesn't exist

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
that is impossible, there's no chance of that being true, because what

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
actually happens is that the mind reforges its own

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
anatomy

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
in order to reveal or occlude

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
features of potential, relation, history, future, possibility

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
and if the mind has never taken on a particular form

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
before, it doesn't know what to do

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
with the information, and so it may generate

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
literally it may just knock you out

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
I've had direct experience of this with things that other people

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
think are completely ordinary and happen all the time

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
your first experience of eating food with your mouth

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
that wasn't just milk was probably like this

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
your first experience of standing up was like this

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
my first experiences of relation

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
erotic relation with women in my teens

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
I go like this, that it was like going to another universe

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
so this idea that you're the arbiter of identity

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
function, situation, circumstance, and you just declare

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
what's happening and what's isn't

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
you can go ahead and play the game of

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
consciousness that way, Neil, Danny, go ahead, be my guest

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
you're going to miss out on most of what it means to be human

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
and from your weird little isolated

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
castle, or your dungeon of naivete

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
you're going to make ex-cathedra declarations that you think

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
other people are just either having us on

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
or they're good actors, I mean this is what the left hemisphere would say about everything

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
that it doesn't originate, grip, control

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
and also anything that would threaten

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
its supremacy and consciousness, and by the left hemisphere what do I really mean? I don't mean

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
the left cerebral

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
hemisphere, what I mean is certain

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
features that we know

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
have an intimate relation with that hemisphere from having done experiments

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
with stroke victims and from having done the water test

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
where we anesthetize one of the

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
hemispheres and we ask the person questions and we can talk to them later about their

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
experiences and so forth, we know that

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
there are faculties

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
from which, okay, there are faculties

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
that representational cognition relies fundamentally upon

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
and these faculties are tyrannical, you can see them

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
in actual tyrants, you can see them all spun up in people like

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
Mr. Trump and other

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
tyrannical nightmarish folks from history

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
who probably need not be named here

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
so there's this aspect

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
again it's like the fingernail on your pinky or the

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
tip of your pinky screaming at the rest of the hand

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
you don't exist, I have never seen a ghost

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
who such thing as possession, I mean that's the hilarious irony

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
is these people who say there's no such thing as possession, okay really?

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
because you are possessed by an array of faculties

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
that are declaring that and you are unaware of your possession

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
and think that what you have is

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
the antithesis or opposite of possession

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
when there's no chance that's true, no chance

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
when there's 10 miles thick

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
you're possessed by a tiny little array of your cognitive faculties

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
a little tiny island, an archipelago in consciousness

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
and that archipelago is saying many things that's not from around here

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
doesn't exist, those other islands have ocean, stuff like that

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
it's not there, there is no boatman

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
boats are a fantasy dreaming thing

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
something very close to me last night was arguing fiercely

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
that romantic love was just an invention made up by poets

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
that everyone decided was a good idea afterwards, he's not entirely wrong

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
but neither is he correct

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
because the mind can reforge

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
its anatomy and under some circumstances

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
that can be

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
not exactly forced

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
but very forcefully catalyzed

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
and so this is really important to understand

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
if you are a person like Danny or Neil who thinks they know things

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
about what it means to be human, what's real and what's not real

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
you don't, you're wrong

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
you're using the point

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
of using one book in a library or one

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
angle of a sphere

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
to determine what is true real good, veritable, trustworthy

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
and so forth, you know Alan Steinfeld who I recently did

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
a beginning interview with

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
spoke about his first experience with a trans channel

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
and he said in the interview

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
you know I met this man

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
and I thought

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
okay either A, he is psychotic

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
B, he's a really really

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
good actor

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
or C, and this is the voice of the left hemisphere

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
incredible doubt and skepticism

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
he said maybe like 12 times

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
there's something going on here that I don't understand

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
and then later Alan was, Alan is a very intelligent

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
well educated person

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
and then so

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
a performance where this

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
actually I can't remember if it's, I think it's a woman who is the channel

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
and she channels an ancient warrior

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
his name is something like

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
something like this, I can't, it was very, this channel is very famous

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
one of the first trans channels

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
he was at a performance

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
the channel picked him out of the audience, pointed him

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
very reluctantly, so I said you mean me?

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
you talking to me? and then the channel said yes, in very elaborate

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
ancient pre-shakesperean

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
English, I said yes my beloved you

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
and Alan had a full

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
on suddenly, very rapidly, the whole tabloid changed

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
he said that the theater filled with a kind of

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
paraphrasing here, like a glowing mist and he rose

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
kind of out of his body and they embraced and he had this experience

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
unlike anything he'd ever had before and you know you can argue

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
whatever you like, ah, hypnosis, blah, blah, blah, I wasn't there, I didn't see

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
that, ah, it's just hearsay, go ahead, be my guest

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
you can argue the same thing about the flavor of food

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
you're not seeing red, that's just blah, blah, blah

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
make up any noises you like, you can make all the face noises you want

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
and you can have all of the critical left hemispheric

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
refutations, be my guest, you're welcome to have them

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
you're wrong, you're just dead wrong, you're missing

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
the thing you're using to determine what is real

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
is only useful in a very, very tiny

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
scope of human

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
experience, nature, being

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
thought, awareness, consciousness, all these

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
things, very tiny scope, it's very useful if you want to tell

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
is that pot hot or cold, very useful there

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
you know, how many coins are in my pocket, very useful there

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
beyond

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
this applicable scope, those faculties

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
are lethal to understanding

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
they crucify it, they basically just rip out its organs

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
and spray them on the wall, so if you think

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
that you know what's going on based on your rationality, you not only

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
don't know what's going on, you're like a bird that thinks

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
only this one feather on my wing

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
or in this case my right wing

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
because birds are similarly lateralized to us

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
only this one feather can I trust, which guess what that means

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
that means that you will never fly

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
and you're a bird, you're born to be sky born

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
you're born for the wind to just

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
lift you up into the atmosphere

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
into the sunlight, into dance with the clouds

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
this is what you're born for and you're really focused on this

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
one feather, you're like, well I've never seen anything incline me to believe

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
blah, blah, blah, blah, okay

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
good luck and everybody's, you know, lots of us start out there

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
the problem is some of us finish there

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
and I have my own biases and perspectives

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
I too can, I've experienced delusion

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
I've also experienced manic insight

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
mantic insight

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
paranoia, grandiose, yes, yes, I've had these experiences

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
and of course we want to be protected

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
from them, we don't want to

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
we don't want our buffers so permeable

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
that anything gets in and that's part of why

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
rationality reigns

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
supreme is because we're really afraid of the

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
contagion of madness, okay, I get it, but there's other approaches

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
that allow us to explore

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
our nature, our origin, our intelligences

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
our creativity, our participatory

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
transcendence

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
and this is very crucial that we have these experiences

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
so we need a buffer

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
against, you know, having the membrane

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
completely ruined

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
by nonsense, which is conceivable

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
but we still need a

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
trustworthy and worthy array of incitements

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
maps, teachers

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
mentors, and perhaps daimons

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
to lead us

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
out of the prison-eering cage

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
of mere rationality

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
that's it for now, more soon, thank you for joining me

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
may your paths be beautiful and your relationships

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
loving and your dreams amazing

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
bye bye for now
