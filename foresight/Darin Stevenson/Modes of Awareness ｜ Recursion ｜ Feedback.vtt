00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello everybody. Welcome.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
I had a dream. I've had many dreams.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Even some visions occasionally. I know the difference.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
Which, I can't say that I'm a visionary.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
But I've had a couple of visions.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
I definitely know the difference between that and a dream.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
A vision, for me anyway, my experience of them.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
They happen during a very specific time

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
in which my mind was in an unusual

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
array of ways.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
And both times, it was in the daytime

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
and suddenly out of nowhere I had to lie down

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
in a moment I lay down.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
In a kind of dreaming experience.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
That's unusually what?

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
Local. Very local. Feels like it's right here.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
And then I see.

01:50.000 --> 01:58.000
I see features of the people who are coming to my home.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
In one case, a doctor.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
I should have understood those symbols.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
In one case, a doctor who I'd never seen before.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
And in another case, a helper.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
In both cases I saw, effectively,

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
specific features of their situation in life

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
that I could not have otherwise possibly have known

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
that were accurate.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
I'm not saying this to take any credit.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
This is not the kind of thing I could reproduce at will.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
It's not like I have a skill necessarily or I have a gift.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
It's more like under conditions,

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
under unusual conditions where the stakes are very high

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
and consciousness is still somewhat coherent.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
So it's like a high stress situation perhaps.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
Other forms of sensing arise in our direct experience.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
And yes, of course it's a problem.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Why is it a problem?

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
Because most of the time we're in an ordinary mode of mind

03:26.000 --> 03:35.000
which lets be really clear

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
is mostly shut down.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
If you have 70 senses in your ordinary mode of mind

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
you've got four, maybe six.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
In your ordinary mode of mind you'll see from one perspective,

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
one array of values,

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
one or maybe two purposes at most.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
In a non-ordinary situation

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
it's almost the opposite.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
You'll see for seven reasons from five perspectives,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
19 purposes.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
You don't have to know what each one is either.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
You just naturally have an increased dimensionality

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
and how is that increased dimensionality expressed?

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
It's expressed symbolically.

04:25.000 --> 04:40.000
So the doctor was depicted as a short man

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
with a cast on his left forearm,

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
a shaggy dog behind a curtain in a small room.

04:50.000 --> 04:57.000
The doctor turned out to be unusually short.

04:57.000 --> 05:07.000
Maybe four, eight, four, nine.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
He did not have a cast on his left arm

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
but at home it turned out he had in fact a shaggy dog

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
that was often in his office

05:19.000 --> 05:28.000
which is a small room behind a curtain in his home.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Now of course you're listening to this

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
in the future of my experience

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
and I can't provide evidence

05:36.000 --> 05:48.000
that what I experienced in my visionary trance

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
is what I am saying it is.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
This is my honest recollection about that event.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
There were a couple of other features

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
because it's so long ago I can't remember.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
It was a very similar situation with the helper

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
in which I accurately described her partner

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
and knew symbolically some things about him

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
that were definitely pertinent

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
to the degree that she laughed

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
and thought like that's hilarious,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
how could anyone know this?

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
Because she understood the symbols as well.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
One of them was a very shiny bowler hat

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
but I cannot recall why she thought

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
that was perfect and important.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
That was a long time ago.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
So we have a reasonable concern

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
about what we call delusions

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
and we have a reasonable concern about insanity.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
The way we make sense of our own identity

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
and its relationship to the world

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
is actually a fairly delicate arrangement

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
of inhibitions.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
And this delicate arrangement of inhibitions

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
gets forged half intentionally,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
half accidentally,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
it's not a 50-50 thing,

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
partly intentionally, partly accidentally,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
partly for coping, partly for play,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
partly for compliance,

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
partly to fulfill various narratives

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
or expectations.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Yeah, this interface of self and world

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
and self-to-self, self-to-world

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
and world-to-self, this interface,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
it's very complicated.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
We have a thing called a private,

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
we could call a private face

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
which is what we see to ourselves

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
if we really look carefully, openly.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
And then we have various layers of other faces.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
You know, closest companions, parents,

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
more distant companions but close

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
and so forth on out to strangers

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
and then on out to possible strangers

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
and out from there to the world itself

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
or some nation or some cohort,

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
a religion, a political party,

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
some faction of humans

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
that share who knows what strange biases,

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
imperatives, predilections,

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
insanities, fictions, beliefs,

08:55.000 --> 09:02.000
faiths, sciences, who knows.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Well, you can see how complex it is

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
because, for example, if we're at all interested in science,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
then we have a face that faces science inside us

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
where we see ourselves from a scientific face.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
If we have a face that knows a little bit about medicine,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
then that face faces us inwardly.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
We decide, like, am I sick?

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Do I have a fever?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
We're using a very special aspect of consciousness

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
when we do this and we're collapsing

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
the entire range of consciousness

09:31.000 --> 09:38.000
into one of its possible modes.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
The mode of doctor, am I sick?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Which we have modeled.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
How have we modeled this?

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Am I seeing doctors portrayed?

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Perhaps by being cared for by them,

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
by being cared for by parents or other elders,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
possibly by being cared for by siblings,

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
possibly by caring for siblings, friends, elders,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
in situations where there's trouble.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
When people are saying,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I wonder what consciousness is,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
I wonder if they're fucking thinking about consciousness.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
What are they thinking about?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
They're not thinking about consciousness

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
because that stuff is so complex.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
It's the thing they're asking the question with.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
So if we have a science-facing self

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
and a medicine-facing self

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
and a psychology-facing self

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
and a myth-facing self,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
all these inside us, right?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
And never mind what we face outside

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
in what we can at least imagine

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
as cohorts that might observe and evaluate us.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
They might ignore us.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
They might, yeah, this is the stuff.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
That is the stuff that stung me when I was little.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
I wonder if it's a nettle.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Just touch this plant and it stung me.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
I wonder what that is.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
So think about how sophisticated your persona is.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
It's ordinarily in a superposition of states,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
we might say, transferring a metaphor

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
from quantum mechanics, right?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
It's not this or that.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
It's not you or not you, right?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
It's in a superposition of states.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
And then something acquires your attention

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
and it begins to collapse towards, say,

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
two or three of them at the same time.

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
Comedian, athlete, physical, keep walking.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
Race car driver, avoid that wreck.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
You know, naturalist.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
What's that plant, animal, bird, insect, et cetera?

11:55.000 --> 12:03.000
That plant stung me good.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
See, it's written, okay, now look at what just happened.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
All right?

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
I started talking about playing the doctor.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
What's the next thing that happened?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I got stung by a plant.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
And that's actually what took place.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
So I'm sitting here, part of my finger is stinging.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
It's a little bit blotchier than it probably should be.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
It doesn't look like a rash yet.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
And I'm collapsing my faculties toward

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
checking the severity of the situation, right?

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
And evaluating how severe is this?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Does it need attention?

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Am I okay?

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Is it going to bubble up into little pustules

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
like when I was a kid and was playing in this stuff

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
one day with my friend Mark?

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
But anyway, my point is,

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
within us, to some degree, to a unique degree,

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
and to different degrees in different situations

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
and times of our lives, we become,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
we collapse the manifold of our identity,

13:15.000 --> 13:22.000
intelligence, awareness, consciousness, emotion, sensation.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
And then as it collapses and becomes highly structured

13:25.000 --> 13:32.000
and specialized, an action ensues, right?

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
I lift my finger and carefully examine the place where it stings.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
For example, or I formulate the sentence

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
that I am speaking right now.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Do you see how pervasive this little toy is?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
So we're doing this all the time,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
but we don't think that way.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
We think, well, I know who Darren is.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
He's a coherent array of habits that I'm well familiar with.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
In fact, to be entirely honest, no one,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
with the possible exception of divine beings or so forth,

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
no one is as familiar with Darren as I am.

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
I am the one who experiences Darren and also enacts him.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
So I would think I know everything that's going on,

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
but I don't because I think I'm one guy

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
and there's nothing like that going on.

14:27.000 --> 14:34.000
You know, if you painted a label on a blurry waterfall of states,

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
you sculpt some word in steel, cold.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
You put it behind the waterfall, okay?

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
The waterfall may indeed be cool.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
It might even be cold, but that doesn't help anyone.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
And that's kind of what we do.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
We think, you know, I am a me.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
It's not untrue and it's most of our experience,

14:59.000 --> 15:09.000
but what happens when enough of the me disappears

15:09.000 --> 15:17.000
that the more than merely me can arise, signal, dance,

15:17.000 --> 15:25.000
express itself, see, know, feel, show?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
What happens then?

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
The more than merely me.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Well, here's a couple things that happen.

15:32.000 --> 15:41.000
Art, medicine, science, heroism, war, sports, music, dance, you know,

15:41.000 --> 15:53.000
speech, sex, rescue, all kinds of things happen.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
From the more than merely me.

15:58.000 --> 16:07.000
And so normally, you know, we like our normalcy because it feels safe

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
and predictable and comfortable.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
We think, oh, I know what's going on, quote, unquote.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Good luck with that.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
That's a convenient fiction.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
If anything serious happened, whether it was seriously beautiful,

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
seriously puzzling, or seriously violent,

16:29.000 --> 16:36.000
you would quickly realize that the mind with which you're comfortable

16:36.000 --> 16:47.000
is almost useless and more like a prison than a sanctuary.

16:47.000 --> 16:54.000
Because sanctuary, and yeah, I'm thinking about Logan's run right here,

16:54.000 --> 17:02.000
straight up, sanctuary exists, but it's not a place.

17:02.000 --> 17:12.000
It's a way of being human, facing ourselves with others facing us,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
facing others, facing the world with the world facing us,

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
facing the sky with the sky facing us.

17:18.000 --> 17:28.000
It's a way of authentically opening the valves, so to speak,

17:28.000 --> 17:34.000
on the puzzle blocks in which our awareness, consciousness, identity,

17:34.000 --> 17:40.000
expectations, emotions, and sensations are usually trapped.

17:40.000 --> 17:47.000
And that box necessarily represents, I don't know, like two hundredths of our nature

17:47.000 --> 18:01.000
and natural ability, our needs, our senses, our faculties,

18:01.000 --> 18:12.000
our ways of seeing and knowing and learning, growing, playing, healing, remembering.

18:12.000 --> 18:21.000
That last one might be the most important.

18:21.000 --> 18:33.000
I had a dream that I was in a prison where my friend, a friend of mine is in prison.

18:33.000 --> 18:42.000
And then I woke up and it seemed like, well, it wasn't too tough in the prison situation.

18:42.000 --> 18:48.000
Things were okay in there, actually.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
It wasn't a lot of danger, bad people, or anything like that.

18:52.000 --> 18:59.000
It was just very constrained.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
A couple times in the dream I got a little bit nervous.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
And then I woke up and I thought, oh, I'm not in a prison.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
That's nice. I didn't actually think that.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I just thought, hmm, I can remember the dream.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Actually, that's what I actually thought.

19:13.000 --> 19:21.000
Because I can remember features of the dream.

19:21.000 --> 19:29.000
And then I listened to a podcast.

19:29.000 --> 19:37.000
Well, various things happened, but I ended up walking around listening to a podcast

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
called Third Eye Drops.

19:43.000 --> 19:50.000
It was something like the ancients knew how to escape the simulation.

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
Now, I want to kind of blur that word simulation

19:57.000 --> 20:11.000
because it conjures computational contexts and structures.

20:11.000 --> 20:19.000
I want to blur that word.

20:19.000 --> 20:27.000
What do I want to call it?

20:27.000 --> 20:33.000
It's not actually a simulation.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
Well, I don't know what it is, first of all.

20:36.000 --> 20:49.000
My experience of it resembles a complex array of obfuscating lenses

20:49.000 --> 20:59.000
that when reality shines through them lead to lesser stasis or hypostasis

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
that don't present things that are merely illusory.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
They're not merely illusory.

21:07.000 --> 21:14.000
Nor are they necessarily a simulation like a machine would make.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
Even if they were, they'd have to be simulations of something.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
So I think simulation is the wrong word.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
You need a much better word.

21:26.000 --> 21:32.000
Hypostasis isn't bad.

21:32.000 --> 21:39.000
How can we illustrate what a hypostasis is?

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
It's an actual metaphor.

21:43.000 --> 21:52.000
Come on, universe.

21:52.000 --> 21:59.000
There's a mountain in the world and there's a representation of the mountain on the map.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
And then there's the representation of the intersection between the mountain on the map

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
and the mountain in our mind.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
So actually the last one is the intersection is between the mountain in the world,

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
the mountain on the map, and the mountain in our mind.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
That's a specific intersection.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
So the mountain on the map is a hypostasis.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
The mountain in the mind is a very strange thing indeed.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
And it's not merely a hypostasis.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
It makes use of both features.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
The hypostasis, which is probably the universe.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I mean, the hypostasis looks crazy.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
It's a tunnel.

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
It's got like origin, universe, galaxy, solar systems.

22:48.000 --> 23:00.000
This solar system, this star, this earth, this moon, then planetary topology local to earth,

23:00.000 --> 23:08.000
then the actual planetary topologies of earth at this moment and whatever in a timeline.

23:08.000 --> 23:17.000
I mean, yeah, the hypostasis is very complex.

23:18.000 --> 23:30.000
The problem is it's almost always useful to have new dimensions in which one can see sense,

23:30.000 --> 23:42.000
know, learn, test, play, reflect, understand,

23:42.000 --> 23:49.000
metaphorize to metaphorize.

23:49.000 --> 23:55.000
It's often good to have more dimensions, but you need coherent.

23:55.000 --> 24:10.000
We need coherent introduction of dimensions, which is something dreaming usually does to some degree.

24:10.000 --> 24:26.000
And some forms of cognitive or intellectual or philosophical pursuit are similar.

24:26.000 --> 24:46.000
The podcast I was listening to on third eye drops was revealing some unusually discussed information about Plato's allegory of the cave in, I think, the republic.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
And the host had some interesting stuff to share.

24:49.000 --> 25:09.000
But what the host was saying, which is something most people who know about the cave allegory are at least familiar with, is that we're trapped in a kind of reduced dimensionality sensorium.

25:10.000 --> 25:18.000
And the dimensionality isn't, it's not in an escapable situation.

25:18.000 --> 25:31.000
The problem is that compared to what we're used to seeing, what's actually going on is terrifyingly profound, beautiful, momentous, and so forth.

25:31.000 --> 25:43.000
So we tend to stay tethered up in the packaged goods version of existence.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
And no one would say they would want that.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I wouldn't say I want that.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
By the way, my finger is fine.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
There's the doctor coming back online for a moment.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
I'm just checking in on my finger with gut stung.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Consciousness collapsing to one of its modes.

26:02.000 --> 26:08.000
Well, what if we could collapse consciousness into three to five modes at the same time instead of one?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
That's what children do.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
That's what brilliant humans do.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
That's probably what gods do.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
Pretty sure if there are aliens, they're doing it.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Spirit beings?

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
Yep, they're up to that for sure.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Trees?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Probably doing that.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Fish?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Bet they're doing it.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
The sky?

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
Pure doing of that.

26:35.000 --> 26:51.000
The sky is like, yeah, I'm stars and galaxies and black holes and quasars and nebula, starbirth nurseries, neutron stars and jupiters.

26:51.000 --> 26:58.000
So there's like, yeah, I'm like one thing.

26:58.000 --> 27:08.000
I mean, it's obviously time space is a meta position, a superposition over the whole category of identities we have on here.

27:08.000 --> 27:17.000
The problem is really that you don't want, okay, once you start being presented with symbolic information,

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
unless you have a coherent sort of what?

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
I guess I'm going to call it, I'm going to be kind of clinical, unless your observation body is coherent.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
You're going to go nuts.

27:31.000 --> 27:38.000
And the symbols themselves are not always coherent.

27:38.000 --> 27:46.000
You know, like the whole situation, you're talking about an interface between, I don't know, a whole bunch of stuff.

27:46.000 --> 27:57.000
The history of life on earth, minds, the between of the self and the world and the universe and the sky and so forth,

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
that between and where these two things overlap.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
And let's face it, they're the same thing.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
So if they're overlapping, what's happening?

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
They're folding back on each other, right?

28:06.000 --> 28:13.000
So if your consciousness is focused out into the world, what it's doing is it's folding back onto its own origin.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Can you see that?

28:15.000 --> 28:21.000
When you're doing the naturalist thing and you're watching the dolphins or whatever,

28:21.000 --> 28:27.000
you're folding back your awareness right onto your own origin.

28:27.000 --> 28:33.000
And this produces feedback and awareness, like bubbling waves, right?

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
Like a sort of a place where a wave meets a wave kind of thing.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
So you see the flowers and you think, oh, it's beautiful, right?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
It's a recursion.

28:42.000 --> 28:51.000
You're seeing, I mean, you're seeing like nine different things at least, probably a billion or endless numbers, infinite things.

28:51.000 --> 28:58.000
But light is the reason you're able to see it all.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
So you're seeing light, right?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
And you're also seeing with light.

29:02.000 --> 29:12.000
So you are the light, seeing the light, seeing the flowers, the flowers are sensing the light, reflecting off you.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
They don't have to have eyes.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
They have cellular hyperstructures.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
So do the trees.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
The flowers are probably fast.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
The trees are a little slower.

29:20.000 --> 29:28.000
Everything senses everything in light and electromagnetism and so forth.

29:28.000 --> 29:35.000
Some materialists will argue, well, the effects are so tiny.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
I know, but the problem is that when things get really tiny, they get really weird.

29:39.000 --> 29:46.000
So let's keep both things in mind and not just say, well, the effects are vanishingly small.

29:46.000 --> 29:56.000
Vanishingly small turns out to be, whoops, superpositions, whoops, black holes or whatever.

29:56.000 --> 30:11.000
Anyway, so you have this problem of not going nuts or of going nuts and then trying to sort of tune the three or four different dials you need to tune to produce coherent feedback, right?

30:11.000 --> 30:20.000
From that recursive interaction at the membrane of the interface, at the boundary of the interface, whatever you think of as the interface, right?

30:20.000 --> 30:44.000
Whether it's your physical vision or the surface of your skin or the electromagnetic boundaries put out by the fields your body produces as a complex cellular hyperstructure, however minute those fields might seem to our measuring machines.

30:44.000 --> 30:56.000
So guess what? There's a feature of consciousness like the doctor or the philosopher, which isn't merely the psychologist, though the psychologist is probably involved if we're doing this well.

30:56.000 --> 31:16.000
Perhaps the counselor and the therapist and the priest and the seer woman and the saint and the witch and so forth, they are in us and they can face ourselves from within us, right?

31:16.000 --> 31:24.000
They are in us, all those things because it's not just what you've seen portrayed in your life, though that may have colored what's in you.

31:24.000 --> 31:52.000
It's what you brought to human birth in the lineage of your particular 873,421 ancestors and nurture what you grew, the context you grew up in and nature herself, the library that's beyond your ancestors that you draw your being from, this world and so forth.

31:52.000 --> 32:21.000
This world would produce all of the different modes of awareness that we humans know of and speak of in our catalog of madman, author, philosopher, child, father, mother, grandmother, grandfather, hunter, warrior, athlete, dramatist, poet, actress, singer, musician, magician, wizard, witch, shaman.

32:22.000 --> 32:31.000
Scientist, naturalist, psychologist, mathematician, engineer, all of these things, the world naturally produces all of these things.

32:31.000 --> 32:40.000
So all of these things, the world is more than them.

32:40.000 --> 32:56.000
The world is the hyperstasis of these modes, right? All these modes are in us.

32:56.000 --> 33:20.000
Few of us will experience the broad array of them, and probably many of us at least, we will have an experience of some we don't like, the patient, the injured one, the victim, the target, scapegoat.

33:26.000 --> 33:46.000
The rejected one, the criminal, the bad person, the outcast, the insane person, the broken person, all these things.

33:46.000 --> 33:53.000
We will have some experience of that array and it will change in different times in our lives.

33:53.000 --> 33:59.000
Hopefully we don't just get stuck in one or two, especially if they're very dark.

34:24.000 --> 34:33.000
So it's funny, the people next to me are talking about a very similar topic.

34:33.000 --> 34:55.000
The dog is simultaneously trying to get at the geese and sneezing, which is its body trying to interrupt it being triggered by the geese.

34:56.000 --> 35:03.000
It's having two very strong conflicting triggers at the same time.

35:03.000 --> 35:11.000
One sort of more psycho-emotional but very physical, eat the goose, chase the goose, get the goose.

35:11.000 --> 35:19.000
And the other one, don't kill the animal, don't run away from the human, don't need to kill the animal.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
Or something, who knows what's in there, but it's making it sneeze.

35:23.000 --> 35:28.000
And dogs often sneeze to interrupt triggers.

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
Or so I've heard.

35:33.000 --> 35:45.000
So of all the kinds of modes that we can have, inside us there's one that oversees the coherence of the entire system.

35:45.000 --> 35:55.000
And that one's job is to determine if we've gone batshit crazy or if we're having actual trustworthy, non-ordinary experience.

35:55.000 --> 36:05.000
Because most forms of crazy resemble or feel like non-ordinary experience and it's hard not to trust them because it's our experience.

36:05.000 --> 36:21.000
So we use the thing we see with, we see because of the thing we see with, the thing we see with casts a sort of a light on our experience.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
And that light is interpretive.

36:24.000 --> 36:32.000
And when it's coherent, non-ordinary sensing, very natural to human beings.

36:32.000 --> 36:42.000
When it's incoherent, or there's a lot of stress, or there's a lot of pain, or there's an overarching narrative.

36:42.000 --> 36:52.000
Or one is being negatively evaluated by others, which is a stress, of course.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
Then the coherence breaks down.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
There's all kinds of things that can break the coherence down.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Sometimes a coherence never forms.

37:00.000 --> 37:05.000
And sometimes we can sort of adjust the dials.

37:05.000 --> 37:15.000
Imagine you have something a bit like an equalizer on a stereo or a piece of musical gear or recording device.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
You've got an equalizer, let's say, who knows what, 12 bands or something.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
We could say six for ease.

37:21.000 --> 37:27.000
Most of them have three, treble, mid, and bass.

37:27.000 --> 37:44.000
So you could equalize the forces of flow in awareness, in the mind, in the inner eye with which you interpret.

37:44.000 --> 37:53.000
With which you are both facing yourself and facing the world, and with which the world is facing you.

37:53.000 --> 38:00.000
It's not an accident that one of the most commonly produced images...

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Well, that's not true.

38:02.000 --> 38:11.000
A very commonly produced image and a trope of schizophrenia, which is probably an outdated term at this point,

38:11.000 --> 38:20.000
and far too broad to effectively discuss states of awareness, is simply a single eye looking.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
A picture of a single eye, they draw this commonly.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
And all of us do.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
I mean, many of us have.

38:29.000 --> 38:40.000
I certainly have drawn when I was little, just a single eye, in the middle of a pyramid or triangle or whatever.

38:40.000 --> 38:47.000
We even have some structure resembling that on our money, I think, at least the one dollar bill, maybe.

38:47.000 --> 38:53.000
Yeah, this is a thing to be observed from without, evaluatively observed,

38:53.000 --> 39:06.000
or observed from without by a disembodied thing, like a machine, or a robot, or a camera, or Facebook, or Google, or Sears, whatever.

39:06.000 --> 39:24.000
Whatever corporation is interested in getting inside your little identity structure and dragging some loyalty out of you, momentary or long term.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
It really is as if we're in a sea of demons trying to get us to worship them.

39:29.000 --> 39:35.000
And money is one of the substitutes for worship.

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
Money is the worship commodity.

39:39.000 --> 39:54.000
Anyway, my point is just that there's a feature of the mind that looks at consciousness's structure, features, activity, results, and decides, am I okay or not?

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
Am I still in my, quote, right mind, unquote?

39:59.000 --> 40:11.000
And now we've looped back, and we're going to start producing feedback against the first topic, which is, okay.

40:11.000 --> 40:17.000
When you look out at the world, it's a wave hitting a wave.

40:17.000 --> 40:27.000
It's the world as a wave, the world is waving, it's making light, bodies, animals, humans, food, all these things, right?

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
And you are the world, and you're looking back at the world.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
So where those two things intersect, there's going to be feedback, that roiling wave phenomenon.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
And you're going to have the same thing happen if you look at consciousness with consciousness.

40:39.000 --> 40:54.000
It's going to produce feedback, just like an electric guitar is, you know, when you take the pickups and put them near the speaker, it's going to start squealing.

40:54.000 --> 41:03.000
Unless, you know, there's mechanisms to stop it or whatever.

41:03.000 --> 41:15.000
When humans who've long been separated first are reunited and they have, they hold each other in a steam and are happy, you'll hear them laughing and raising their voices in the tone of their voices.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Feedback, right?

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
When they're departing just as those people were, same thing, bye!

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
Raise your voice, wave your hands, it's feedback, it's a wave.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
Literally wave your hands, I mean.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
So when you look at consciousness with consciousness, it's going to produce feedback.

41:33.000 --> 41:42.000
Now you really have a problem because you're trying to determine, you've got one aspect of consciousness, the sort of overseer in a way.

41:42.000 --> 41:49.000
Not in the bad sense, the one who checks to see if you're okay, mainly.

41:49.000 --> 42:08.000
So you've got this overseer dude or chick or whatever, looking at the flow of consciousness and remarking on it, analyzing it, testing it, checking it.

42:08.000 --> 42:14.000
Well, that's going to produce feedback right away, you're going to have a lot of trouble with that.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
Now most of the time it works fairly well because its job isn't too tough.

42:18.000 --> 42:26.000
With ordinary consciousness, it's not too hard to do a state check and come away with a green light, right?

42:26.000 --> 42:42.000
But once you start having non-ordinary experiences of consciousness, unless you have practice and you know something about a strange way in which awareness and consciousness resemble a kind of a living water.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
If you know something about that, you've got a better shot.

42:46.000 --> 42:53.000
If you don't, what will happen is the shapes in the waves, the shapes in the feedback will overwhelm you.

42:53.000 --> 43:07.000
You will identify with them, you'll take them seriously, you'll take them literally, you'll take them hyper-connectively or synchromistically, and that's when you're going to get into trouble.

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
Now, there are kind of...

43:23.000 --> 43:36.000
There's a sort of a pareidolia, right, which is the inclination to see figures in flowing, changing shapes like the grain in wood or the bark on a tree

43:37.000 --> 43:52.000
color differentials in quartz, the inclusions in quartz, those things form the suggestions of shapes.

43:52.000 --> 44:00.000
And when consciousness examines consciousness and produces feedback, it's like this, right, it does this.

44:00.000 --> 44:14.000
And, you know, that interaction, if a deco here is just a little bit, will slip toward paranoia or megalomania or both.

44:14.000 --> 44:24.000
And some other, you know, mania, paranoia, megalomania, hyper-creativity.

44:31.000 --> 44:42.000
There are many different modes of madness, and there's a whole range of this kind of phenomenon, consciousness, that isn't bad or malignant.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
It won't get you killed. I've seen it in a number of people.

44:46.000 --> 45:04.000
They're in a sort of what we might think of as a manic state, but there's authentic, something resembling authentic prophetic awareness.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
And this is a huge problem because you can have both things going on.

45:08.000 --> 45:20.000
You can have the person is in the grip of a series of narratives, and they're having authentic prophetic awareness at the same time.

45:20.000 --> 45:26.000
They have escaped the prison, outside the prison world of ordinary mind.

45:26.000 --> 45:35.000
They're not merely batshit crazy, and they're learning, they're sort of like a bird on its first flight.

45:36.000 --> 45:46.000
They're learning how to see with the seven other eyes of the self and the soul.

45:46.000 --> 45:52.000
And it doesn't have to be seven, I'm just using that like nine, thirteen, whatever you like.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
The many other eyes of the soul.

45:55.000 --> 46:02.000
And normally what happens among the ordinary humans is the ordinary humans just shut up now.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
They don't know how to relate with that at all.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
They have no protocols for that, so they just shut them down.

46:11.000 --> 46:29.000
This usually ends in hospitalization, drugging, self harm, accident, all kinds of things.

46:32.000 --> 46:48.000
So we want, most of us, we want some degree of non-ordinary.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
We want to get a little bit out of the prison and we don't want to go insane.

46:53.000 --> 46:59.000
Well if you're going to go to, right, if you're a person who's lived in the desert your entire life

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
and you decide like, I really want to go swim in the ocean.

47:03.000 --> 47:12.000
You don't just go jump, you know, from an airplane into the open sea.

47:12.000 --> 47:18.000
You talk, you learn about the ocean, you learn about the water, you learn about currents

47:18.000 --> 47:28.000
and how to solve various problems that will certainly arise when you encounter the actual ocean.

47:28.000 --> 47:35.000
That will throw you around, sink you, trap you, drown you, eat you.

47:35.000 --> 47:40.000
You learn about these things, right, and it's the same with consciousness.

47:40.000 --> 47:46.000
Over time you will naturally, as long as you don't go completely nuts

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
or burn your mind with either drugs or trauma, or both,

47:51.000 --> 48:02.000
those things can burn patterns into the flow that are not helpful and can be leafily terrible.

48:02.000 --> 48:10.000
You can sort of crack the membrane in such a way that the crack tends to persist over time

48:11.000 --> 48:17.000
with drugs, with trauma.

48:17.000 --> 48:28.000
Sometimes just with probably DNA, heredity, maybe, nature and nurture, toxins are also trauma.

48:29.000 --> 48:39.000
So, it's dangerous terrain and...

48:39.000 --> 49:01.000
So, you know, it's not the kind of thing where you want to just go messing about with it.

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
And this is mostly what happens with young people and with older people.

49:06.000 --> 49:15.000
They mess about rather unskillfully using drugs and adventurism and so forth.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
Huge problem.

49:18.000 --> 49:29.000
Dreaming is the near-at-hand doorway to probably everything you can hope for in terms of getting outside the prison.

49:29.000 --> 49:49.000
It's a natural deprisming process, right, and it's a living process that happens to most of us with great regularity.

49:49.000 --> 50:01.000
It's rich. It decolapses the mode of identity and consciousness.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
It's very profound.

50:04.000 --> 50:12.000
And that is another self-facing aspect of awareness, right, the dreaming aspect.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
It doesn't face the world.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Well, maybe it does in a way.

50:17.000 --> 50:34.000
Maybe it mirrors the world rather than facing it with itself facing inwardly.

50:34.000 --> 50:41.000
But we can achieve something not dissimilar in what we think of as ordinary consciousness as well.

50:41.000 --> 50:49.000
And to some degree, by talking of these matters, by considering them unconscious in our awareness,

50:49.000 --> 51:02.000
we are already beginning to step just a little bit outside the prison of ordinary thought without going all the way to madness, you see.

51:02.000 --> 51:23.000
And talking about some of the dangers that we may encounter when we depart the extremely stultifying predictability,

51:23.000 --> 51:42.000
normalcy of our habitual state of mind.

51:42.000 --> 52:06.000
I'm playing the violin.

52:06.000 --> 52:17.000
If we move from one of the specific modes of self-facing awareness, consciousness, intention, purpose, one of the forms.

52:17.000 --> 52:29.000
Even if we move away from, if I move away from the daring form just toward the human or the organism or the being or the planet or the sky tree,

52:29.000 --> 52:52.000
if I move away, then the field becomes rich, very rich inside it with ways of seeing that aren't trapped like my mind often is.

52:52.000 --> 53:20.000
It's when I am shrunk down to daring and I'm worried about my worries and identity seems concrete, explicit, given by circumstances, structured, compelling, continuous.

53:20.000 --> 53:29.000
Patrick McGowan's old TV series, highly experimental, called The Prisoner.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
It's hilarious.

53:32.000 --> 53:37.000
This old TV series, it's kind of about this problem.

53:37.000 --> 53:44.000
It's the problem of folding consciousness or awareness back upon its origins.

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
And look, this is what physicists do.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
This is what philosophers do.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
This is what children do.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Mothers are doing this.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
The sky is doing this.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
The world is doing this.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
This is the dooming of all things.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
They're doing this.

54:01.000 --> 54:06.000
They're being this process.

54:06.000 --> 54:27.000
Well, we can get trapped in a backwater, so to speak, of the labyrinth of feedback that results from recursion in the between of consciousness and being.

54:27.000 --> 54:42.000
And if we direct consciousness at itself, which is effectively what we usually mean when we say the words meditation is kind of what we mean.

54:42.000 --> 54:50.000
We mean to become observant of kind of the surface of the water of the mind from above it.

54:50.000 --> 55:03.000
And long observation of that will give us the skills, naturally, to not lose our way if we should suddenly find ourselves outside the prison.

55:03.000 --> 55:08.000
Or if the prison should start to dissolve, so to speak.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
We won't panic.

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
We'll remember, ah, yes, this is just the dissolution of the walls.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
It's always interesting.

55:16.000 --> 55:22.000
It's very commonly like this.

55:22.000 --> 55:38.000
These features are familiar from what I've experienced in just observing my own mind and how it transforms from a modal thing to its potential state.

55:38.000 --> 55:46.000
A state of potential, and even the potential can half fade into origin.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
And some will say, why are you saying half?

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
And I'll say, because I said half.

55:52.000 --> 56:00.000
Yes, you have origin, potential, and just tiny little bubbles of structure on the surface that can fade away.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
Now, identity is gone.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
Now, perhaps, no more symbols either.

56:07.000 --> 56:14.000
Enlightenment, the living light in awareness of its own origin and nature.

56:14.000 --> 56:21.000
But to get there, you know, I've not got there.

56:21.000 --> 56:28.000
I've walked in that direction, some.

56:28.000 --> 56:46.000
So I've learned a little tiny bit about the water and the eddies and the currents and the character of the situation.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
We are born to see outside the prison.

56:49.000 --> 57:07.000
We start from outside the prison, and we walk into it and build it up on purpose as we are instructed to do by our peers, parents, culture, history, language,

57:07.000 --> 57:15.000
thrifts of various kinds, isms.

57:15.000 --> 57:22.000
And then, because we are so familiar with it, we get married to it.

57:22.000 --> 57:28.000
We get stuck in it.

57:28.000 --> 57:35.000
The spider's web is supposed to extend its sensorium and world line.

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
If our minds were like this, they would.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
They do, naturally.

57:41.000 --> 57:55.000
But our minds can become a trap in that we get stuck on features of the web that we've made and we confuse those features of ourselves.

57:55.000 --> 58:04.000
Our identity or our situation and so forth.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
I am home. I will rest.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
Thank you for joining me.

58:10.000 --> 58:15.000
I wish you a very beautiful way and day and dreams.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
See you.

58:18.000 --> 58:24.000
I look forward to learning together again, sometime soon.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
Bye-bye for now.
