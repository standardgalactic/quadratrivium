00:00.000 --> 00:15.080
Hello everybody. Welcome. I appreciate all of you who listen to my recordings and it

00:15.080 --> 00:21.720
would help me a lot if you subscribe or like them or make a comment or ask a

00:21.720 --> 00:33.160
question. My engagement is embarrassingly minute. So to reach more people, whatever

00:33.160 --> 00:37.680
help you care to lend would be greatly appreciated. But I'm glad you're just

00:37.680 --> 00:44.280
here and that I'm here. We're both still alive. Apparently we're breathing. I'm

00:44.280 --> 00:53.920
crossing urban streets on foot, which is vastly more dangerous than we like to

00:53.920 --> 01:03.240
think. It turns out that although there are many explanations for the complexity

01:03.240 --> 01:10.680
of our human brains, I strongly suspect many of them are either completely

01:10.680 --> 01:24.320
wrong or put the precedents on the wrong thing. Obviously social cognition is one

01:24.320 --> 01:31.160
of them and it would be amazing if we developed complex brains to handle

01:31.160 --> 01:40.640
social cognition. Only to discover that that would cause us to simulate, this is

01:40.640 --> 01:45.000
one of the explanations for human brain complexity, that would cause us to simulate

01:45.000 --> 01:54.160
another which would become the self a fiction. Because similar to one of my

01:54.160 --> 02:00.360
fingers deciding that it is real and the rest of the hand is well whatever that

02:00.360 --> 02:15.000
is, we would become catastrophically misguided thereafter, continue to produce

02:15.000 --> 02:24.480
simulations, as well as representational culture, right, where we with each thing we

02:24.480 --> 02:38.000
lose direct participation and relation with. We form a token and then thereafter

02:38.000 --> 02:45.600
relate with the token instead of resurrecting the relationship and the

02:45.600 --> 02:55.440
participation. And so we end up in an endless thirst trap where the more

02:55.440 --> 03:00.920
representations we make, the more we are suffocating for participation and

03:00.920 --> 03:08.280
meaningful roles and relationships, and this leads to a descending nightmare of

03:08.480 --> 03:25.720
self-amplifying, what is the word, poverty, impoverishment. And this seems to

03:25.720 --> 03:36.200
match up pretty damn good with what I see going on. But the social cognition

03:36.200 --> 03:43.240
argument is powerful, the problem is it leads to an endless cascade of disasters

03:43.240 --> 04:00.840
as we stop relating with and in pod groups in which our identity and purpose

04:00.840 --> 04:13.800
of motivations are useful, celebrated, effective, alive, vital, creative, playful,

04:13.800 --> 04:21.040
joyful, fulfilling, rewarding. You know get together with a team of three people

04:21.040 --> 04:28.360
and do anything meaningful, right. The rewards at the end of the day are off the

04:28.360 --> 04:39.080
scale compared to any possible representation you could form. Yes, this

04:39.080 --> 04:51.720
is all the change I have. The large coin is a dollar. You're welcome. That poor old

04:51.840 --> 05:03.360
woman, my goodness, she must be 70 and she's living on the street. You see what

05:03.360 --> 05:13.840
ends up happening, right, like without meaningful cohorts that are real, our

05:13.840 --> 05:19.680
elderly end up dying alone in boxes or we're still on the street. And what do I

05:19.920 --> 05:27.040
mean by our elderly? Okay, I get the problem with the language. I do. We could just say

05:27.040 --> 05:36.880
the elderly, which we will all become. So that's us in the future. Okay, what else?

05:36.880 --> 05:47.720
Where am I here? Social cognition, meaningful groups, pods. So in our situation,

05:47.760 --> 05:52.840
what's the what's the antidote here? So the first is to teach each other to

05:52.840 --> 06:01.320
understand the representational gambit's foundations, right, which involve the

06:01.320 --> 06:07.680
simulation of a separate self and then the inaction of a separable self that

06:07.680 --> 06:15.840
becomes an isolated self. Ask yourself this question. I'll ask myself the same

06:15.880 --> 06:25.160
question. How many times per month do I directly physically engage meat space

06:26.160 --> 06:30.640
with other humans for meaningful purposes that I trust and are beautiful

06:30.640 --> 06:36.800
and noble? So first of all, how often do I engage with meat space others for

06:36.800 --> 06:47.880
anything? Myself, with a couple of trenchant exceptions, one being somebody I

06:47.880 --> 06:55.920
live with, the number of times per month that happens for me is zero. And that's

06:55.960 --> 07:08.200
part of why I make these videos, because this is a way for me to participate, to

07:08.200 --> 07:25.840
work my vocabulary, which is important because my vocabulary is one of my

07:25.880 --> 07:31.520
as a writer and someone who values articulate intelligent speech. My

07:31.520 --> 07:38.920
vocabulary is crucially important. I've worked hard to develop it over my life,

07:39.920 --> 07:50.080
although it was natural for me to do that because of my interests. And also to

07:50.800 --> 08:06.800
create a context where I'm doing something meaningful in the day to me that

08:06.800 --> 08:12.760
may provide benefit for distance others, some of whom I know, some of whom I love,

08:13.760 --> 08:23.160
many of whom are unknown to me. There's just sort of people who manage to find my

08:23.160 --> 08:30.640
channel. But this is not particularly crucially important to my point. I'm

08:30.640 --> 08:35.800
merely trying to say that ask yourself the question. How often over some

08:36.120 --> 08:43.840
interval, say 90 days, are you able to get together with other humans and enact

08:43.880 --> 08:50.480
your humanity intelligently, creatively, meaningfully for a purpose you believe

08:50.480 --> 09:00.720
in? And even if today in our time, right, circa 2024, that's a virtual get

09:00.720 --> 09:07.520
together. Let's count those. We'll open the aperture from meat space only to

09:08.560 --> 09:14.240
virtual context. But you can see the radical difference, right? Suppose that

09:17.520 --> 09:22.960
I'm just going to pick something incredibly trivial. Three neighbors once a

09:22.960 --> 09:29.760
month get together, wander around their neighborhood together and pick up trash.

09:31.520 --> 09:39.480
Not particularly heroic, but powerful because they're doing something they

09:39.480 --> 09:45.960
believe in and they will communicate and act as a single member, right? Act like a

09:45.960 --> 09:53.240
hand. In fact, they'll literally be picking things up. It's very handlike. And

09:53.240 --> 10:00.680
of course, it turns out that the hand is one of the best metaphors for human

10:01.680 --> 10:09.480
togetherness and unity that you can possibly come up with. It might be the

10:09.480 --> 10:16.760
best because there's there's just there's nothing. It's a part of your

10:16.760 --> 10:23.360
physical body, right? So hello.

10:28.520 --> 10:36.400
It was developed by evolution. So the model is not a human intellectual model.

10:37.400 --> 10:41.440
It's an evolutionary model. It's older than old.

10:41.440 --> 10:55.520
It's a really good model for the actual nature of human existence being

10:55.520 --> 11:04.000
interiority. I noticed that the first thing that happens when you destroy

11:04.000 --> 11:12.200
human social groups is that you get individual fingers attempting to do

11:12.200 --> 11:21.240
things to enact their humanity in ways that require a hand. I'd love to see

11:21.240 --> 11:28.480
any one attempt to use any of our tools. Though, you know, they might succeed with

11:28.480 --> 11:33.600
a few. Try and use pliers with a single finger. I mean, try to do anything with a

11:33.600 --> 11:38.480
single finger. You might be able to sort of play some kind of musical

11:38.480 --> 11:45.520
instrument as long as it didn't require your breath. You could plunk your way

11:45.520 --> 11:49.000
along something with a single finger, presuming that you had a hand that the

11:49.000 --> 11:54.600
finger was on the end of. The way that our systems work is as if they amputate

11:54.600 --> 11:58.880
the fingers and then scream at them for not being able to do all the things that

11:58.880 --> 12:06.560
a hand could do. So obviously what I'm trying to say here is that the

12:06.560 --> 12:15.000
embodiment and fulfillment of our potentials as human beings naturally

12:15.000 --> 12:28.520
requires communion. Potting up. You will see very few intelligent animals

12:28.560 --> 12:39.440
there are exceptions that don't pot up. One exception would be octopuses. The

12:39.440 --> 12:54.040
other polarity are the organisms that form supergroups. These would be creatures

12:54.080 --> 13:03.720
that form hives. Ants, bees, wasps, certain species of spider form

13:03.720 --> 13:16.360
massive web communities. Unclear. It may be that the fundamental problem with our

13:16.360 --> 13:28.680
species is just that we form misguided supergroups. So what was I thinking

13:28.680 --> 13:38.320
originally here? Oh yes. All right.

13:38.760 --> 13:49.040
So we've actually I've actually covered much more ground than I was imagining

13:49.040 --> 14:00.240
when I began my talk and what was inspiring me. Okay so I'm going to circle

14:00.240 --> 14:12.320
way back here. I sometimes form relationships with animals by offering

14:12.320 --> 14:24.880
them food and there are certain animals with which it is less dangerous for

14:24.880 --> 14:35.080
both of us than it would be with others. So for example I am currently in the

14:35.080 --> 14:41.200
San Francisco Botanical Gardens. The coyotes here are reasonably well known

14:41.200 --> 14:50.600
to me. I see them commonly. I could easily form relationships with them by

14:50.600 --> 15:01.760
bringing them some meat. Any transaction between humans and wild things,

15:01.760 --> 15:09.320
especially city humans, will produce a lot of danger for both participants.

15:09.320 --> 15:19.320
Primarily because the human is dumb about what is important for the animals.

15:20.600 --> 15:25.160
Don't know if you heard that. That was a coyote.

15:27.280 --> 15:32.080
Let's see if it, yeah it's yipping.

15:39.800 --> 15:44.080
All right let's examine this problem here.

15:44.080 --> 15:58.320
Okay this is a really good, really good instance of synchronicity.

16:05.480 --> 16:13.040
It's crucial for all animals to avoid danger and one of the ways they avoid

16:13.080 --> 16:19.800
danger is by avoiding calling attention to themselves. There are some situations

16:19.800 --> 16:29.960
under which it is relatively more safe to call attention to oneself and others

16:29.960 --> 16:39.960
under which it's extremely dangerous. There's only one animal here around here

16:40.000 --> 16:49.600
that is a threat to the coyote and that's homo sapiens. If I were to begin

16:49.600 --> 17:00.120
feeding a coyote and I could delude myself into thinking this is a good way

17:00.120 --> 17:05.760
to establish a relationship with them and to nourish that relationship

17:05.760 --> 17:18.360
literally, physically. Okay the reason that coyote is calling out at full

17:18.360 --> 17:28.880
volume in broad daylight. Very dangerous thing for it to do is that there are

17:28.880 --> 17:41.200
sirens. So the humans make a machine that mimics a signal that essentially

17:41.200 --> 17:51.600
causes, nearly forces the coyote to reveal its location. I mean if you wanted

17:51.600 --> 17:57.560
to hunt coyotes you could just bring a device with you that produced sirens and

17:57.840 --> 18:06.600
they would light up their location with calls because they're physically, to some

18:06.600 --> 18:19.040
degree, they are physically unable to resist that stimuli.

18:28.000 --> 18:41.360
Hi. Now if I were to begin feeding coyotes around here what would naturally

18:41.360 --> 18:53.600
happen is that I would interfere with their natural tendency, one might call

18:53.640 --> 19:00.680
it, at least around here, to avoid contact with humans. Now if I live, if I were not

19:00.680 --> 19:09.480
a city dweller and I lived in the wilderness and I wanted to have a

19:09.480 --> 19:15.480
relationship with the coyotes, there are a number of different ways I might go

19:15.560 --> 19:24.560
about forming that relationship. Perhaps the most important but least blatant is

19:24.560 --> 19:33.680
to imagine that the coyotes form an emissary to the humans and I form an

19:33.680 --> 19:38.520
emissary from the humans and in my imagination and perhaps in my dreaming

19:39.480 --> 19:48.480
me and the emissary meet and we exchange protections and potencies and

19:48.480 --> 19:58.640
medicine and so forth. Humans are unlikely, modern particularly, unlikely to pursue

19:58.640 --> 20:07.480
that kind of connection. Many of them would not believe that it's real but

20:07.520 --> 20:14.040
that would be a good way and then perhaps I could ask the coyote emissary

20:14.040 --> 20:19.400
questions and it could ask me questions and it might even have things to say

20:19.400 --> 20:25.440
to my people, things that wished to be communicated to my people about their

20:25.440 --> 20:34.480
people and our ancient union because some animals, synanthropes particularly,

20:34.480 --> 20:46.080
have had more than a million years of relationship with Homo sapiens and you

20:46.080 --> 20:51.800
could say well our species really isn't that old, are you sure? Yes, our species

20:51.800 --> 20:58.440
isn't that single age old or it probably is. I don't know what the current model

20:58.440 --> 21:03.760
is of our estimated age of Homo sapiens. Probably measured in flat years though

21:03.760 --> 21:10.560
which there never were so our age is actually the time since the appearance

21:10.560 --> 21:16.160
of Homo sapiens in the in the records so to speak times the number of humans

21:16.160 --> 21:26.840
who have lived one year right and for each year we'd have to add age so our

21:26.840 --> 21:31.320
actual age and the age of our relationships with synanthropes is

21:31.360 --> 21:44.280
absurdly enormous. Bees, ants, wasps, mice, rats, porcupines, possums, skunks,

21:44.560 --> 21:54.920
moles, gophers, house cats, house dogs, coyotes, wolves,

21:54.920 --> 22:15.560
blue jays, magpies, sparrows, hawks, eagles, raptors, owls, crows and ravens, spiders,

22:15.560 --> 22:24.480
all of these are synanthropes, these are creatures that prosper and are used to

22:24.520 --> 22:34.920
the proximity of human symbionts, companions. Extended body is the concept

22:34.920 --> 22:45.080
here not Darren has crow friends, extended body, I am crow, I am blue jay, I am

22:45.080 --> 22:52.960
sparrow, I am spider, these organisms as they interact with me extend my

22:53.000 --> 23:00.360
intelligence, they extend my senses dramatically, I will learn things from

23:00.360 --> 23:05.760
observing them that are formally impossible for me to discover on my

23:05.760 --> 23:14.000
own quote unquote. So in a sense what I'm advocating here is the formulation not

23:14.040 --> 23:24.560
merely of a human relational hand-like situation but a very complex hand-like

23:24.560 --> 23:32.520
situation involving many non-humans including the non-synanthropes presuming

23:32.520 --> 23:39.200
that there is any such thing because synanthropy is a matter of degree, not

23:39.720 --> 23:49.880
necessarily, you know, binary polarization either is a synanthrop or isn't.

23:49.880 --> 24:01.640
On if you take the planet as a whole and you realize that like your comparator is

24:02.000 --> 24:05.600
what we know of time-space

24:15.640 --> 24:20.960
so if you take sorry I'm having an actual exchange with synanthropes right now

24:20.960 --> 24:30.640
again ironic or synchronous or both

24:31.640 --> 24:41.440
if you take as your time-space as your comparator then the earth is basically

24:41.440 --> 24:49.400
like a little droplet of water in a vast desert and that droplet there's nothing

24:49.400 --> 24:57.040
that isn't synanthropic there because essentially from this perspective from

24:57.040 --> 25:01.360
the perspective of time-space toward the earth rather than the earth out you

25:01.360 --> 25:06.320
know the human out to nature nature out to time-space which is the perspective

25:06.320 --> 25:15.120
we are trained to take by our language and its categorical gambits it's absurd

25:15.120 --> 25:23.080
and stupidifying categorical gambit. The whole package of lies that comes along

25:23.120 --> 25:31.840
with English courtroom mind war mind anthropocentricity terracentricity all of

25:31.840 --> 25:38.040
these things so from from time-space toward earth what you obviously have

25:38.040 --> 25:42.440
here and if you're not capable of thinking this way I will argue you're

25:42.440 --> 25:47.800
barely capable of thinking at all is what you have here is a single organism

25:48.240 --> 25:54.880
that takes many forms now it may turn out to be absolutely a physical fact that

25:54.880 --> 26:05.080
that's what you've got here one imagines for example a space faring organism

26:05.080 --> 26:16.160
that I'll call starfish it naturally swims between the stars in a proto form

26:16.440 --> 26:22.320
that proto form could be incredibly profusely transcendent not merely

26:22.320 --> 26:30.080
intelligent and it may only be a cellular form and still be transcendent

26:30.080 --> 26:36.000
there's no reason to believe bacteria are probably not

26:36.000 --> 26:44.240
representationally intelligent but it's unlikely that we could get the forms of

26:44.240 --> 26:53.800
intelligence we're familiar with in human beings without them and so which is

26:53.800 --> 27:01.520
superior right is the origin superior or is the results superior well once you

27:01.520 --> 27:07.120
decide that one of them has to be superior you're already having courtroom

27:07.400 --> 27:14.240
my point is just that it may well be that a single organism was primordial

27:14.240 --> 27:19.000
here and that everything that you see that lives on this planet is actually

27:19.000 --> 27:27.360
starfish's morphs right morphs of starfish one thing one one organism it

27:27.360 --> 27:38.920
may also be that that organ that there were multiple forms of starfish that

27:38.920 --> 27:44.440
lived that came here dwelt here there might have been some competition stuff

27:44.440 --> 27:53.600
that looks like war but isn't but yeah you got one organism here so you should

27:53.600 --> 27:57.240
definitely be able to think that way and you should probably think that way in

27:57.240 --> 28:05.320
precedence to thinking oh these are all separate Darwinian Lee competitive

28:05.320 --> 28:12.760
morphs that last thing can't be true primarily it's the problem with the

28:12.760 --> 28:18.000
idea of competition there's no such thing as competition without symbiosis if

28:18.000 --> 28:27.000
you don't have cooperation you don't get forms complex enough to compete so

28:27.040 --> 28:36.600
the emphasis on competition is almost certainly a bad move all right if I

28:36.600 --> 28:42.920
feed the coyotes in the botanical gardens it will reduce their suspicion

28:42.920 --> 28:51.320
and avoidance of humans in general what that will mean in very short order here

28:51.640 --> 28:57.680
is that the coyotes I feed will eventually realize ah humans are a source

28:57.680 --> 29:06.520
of food food is difficult and dangerous to get here I'm gonna occasionally

29:06.520 --> 29:10.600
approach humans some of those humans will have children some of them may have

29:10.600 --> 29:20.440
dogs and coyotes will generally see small dogs small coyotes smaller

29:20.440 --> 29:26.160
coyotes will see small dogs actually all coyotes will most coyotes will see

29:26.160 --> 29:33.360
small dogs as prey that's a that's a good meal that's fairly easy to obtain so

29:33.360 --> 29:40.480
they may go after those small dogs and that will result almost certainly in

29:40.480 --> 29:47.360
the humans killing them particularly here in the botanical gardens

29:58.480 --> 30:08.720
similarly if I feed the blue jays peanuts which they love

30:10.480 --> 30:23.800
that signal

30:23.800 --> 30:33.880
resembles playing a siren in the territory of coyotes

30:40.480 --> 30:56.120
an analogy would be dropping hundred dollar bills along a busy freeway why a

30:56.120 --> 31:08.360
busy freeway well for the blue jays many of them live in the hunting territory

31:08.360 --> 31:19.440
of hawks and so when I come with my peanuts it doesn't shut off their

31:19.440 --> 31:30.040
vigilance their vigilance but it radically reduces it it's funny I have

31:30.040 --> 31:45.440
learned to recognize the shadow of the birds that I know so that sometimes I

31:45.440 --> 31:54.600
can detect them behind me so if I put peanuts out and if I'm not careful

31:54.600 --> 31:59.680
about it and I'm not attentive and I had to learn this by error by making bad

31:59.720 --> 32:09.520
mistakes costly mistakes then I'm interfering with their vigilance

32:09.520 --> 32:16.640
who's responsibility is it it's not a courtroom this is a communal animal me

32:16.640 --> 32:31.520
plus the birds right so I also love the hawks and I have some relationship with

32:31.520 --> 32:42.920
them as well but I don't want them to eat my blue jay friends obviously I want

32:42.920 --> 32:54.800
them to get fed now all of this is very complex the problem is that I am not

32:54.800 --> 33:09.320
aware ordinarily of the environmental relational historical biological

33:09.720 --> 33:20.760
necessities of blue jay life or hawk life or coyote life and so if I wander

33:20.760 --> 33:32.800
into that stumbling around like a magical thinking human an indictment that I

33:32.800 --> 33:38.600
certainly deserve but I'm now beginning to understand in a in a richer way I

33:38.680 --> 33:50.920
like to think I'm learning I will cause harm where my goal is to have beneficial

33:50.920 --> 33:59.960
relations usually beneficial relations and that will be emotionally painful for

33:59.960 --> 34:16.200
me because my desires are not utilitarian I am aware that the animal

34:16.200 --> 34:32.720
intelligences including the insects will in a sense make offerings of

34:32.720 --> 34:43.160
intelligence dreaming communal identity they will benefit me they will try to

34:43.160 --> 34:51.480
figure out what what will benefit the one who is our friend and many of those

34:51.480 --> 34:54.720
offerings will not be ordinary it's not like they're gonna bring me cash money

34:54.720 --> 35:01.160
though in the case of a representational animal like say a particularly precocious

35:01.160 --> 35:12.480
raven such a thing could take place it could bring me objects so if I want to

35:12.480 --> 35:22.040
actually honor the relationship I have to to some degree protect the living

35:22.040 --> 35:40.400
beings from the rapacious and omnicidal stupidity of my species and also my own

35:40.440 --> 35:50.480
ignorance it will be difficult for me to form physical relationships with the

35:50.480 --> 35:58.360
coyotes in this garden without feeding them if I feed them it is very likely

35:58.360 --> 36:04.320
that will lead to them being shot by parts in Iraq or whoever does animal

36:04.320 --> 36:08.520
control whatever parts in Iraq will call animal control will come out and

36:08.800 --> 36:18.760
quote-unquote basically need to obliterate them you know more stories of

36:18.760 --> 36:27.720
during stupidity so one night I was sitting in my room and out one of my

36:27.720 --> 36:36.240
windows I noticed a family of coyotes excuse me a family of raccoons boy

36:36.280 --> 36:47.400
here's a if you want to talk about courage motivation intelligence difficulty

36:47.400 --> 36:58.720
heroism one pride one standout exemplar of this would be raccoon mothers in

36:58.720 --> 37:06.080
urban settings there's no one to babysit the children the children like

37:06.440 --> 37:16.720
any children are precocious playful curious very difficult to orient meanwhile

37:16.720 --> 37:22.760
this mother has to bring them through places with dogs and cars and broken

37:22.760 --> 37:30.640
bottles and poison and every kind of dogs every kind of threat cats you can

37:30.640 --> 37:38.080
imagine coyotes every night every night that mother is going to bring their

37:38.080 --> 37:45.240
children through a battlefield of things that will kill them and her so one night

37:45.240 --> 37:57.200
I'm in my room it's late quiet and I hear the chortling of the of the

37:57.200 --> 38:06.640
children naturally stupid as I am and also you know at that point prone to

38:06.640 --> 38:16.400
magical thinking I emulate the sound back to them what happens the family of

38:16.400 --> 38:19.800
raccoon stops dead in the middle of the street trying to determine the source of

38:19.800 --> 38:28.280
that sound meanwhile a car doing 40 miles an hour comes up the street and

38:28.280 --> 38:38.280
somehow I think that even though they were in the car's path when it passed I

38:38.280 --> 38:47.080
think they all managed to survive unscathed I am not sure one of them

38:47.080 --> 38:51.880
might have been struck by the undercarriage of the car however if that

38:51.880 --> 38:56.400
were true there should have been a dead raccoon nearby in the morning probably

38:56.400 --> 39:08.080
baby in any case if you want to imagine me cringing to the core of my being for

39:08.080 --> 39:20.680
a moment you know I thought I was being playful and human and intelligent and

39:20.680 --> 39:26.960
recognizing them and relating with them what I did not realize is they are on a

39:26.960 --> 39:34.680
street there is traffic in the street this is why I made the metaphor of dropping

39:34.680 --> 39:44.920
$100 bills on the freeway when I put out peanuts for the blue jays I had best be

39:44.920 --> 39:51.400
complicit in their survival concerns vigilance protocols I had best

39:51.400 --> 39:58.360
understand something deep about these because if I don't I am I am giving

39:58.360 --> 40:07.200
them an irresistible stimulus in a terrain where there are hawks not only

40:07.200 --> 40:18.320
that there are most likely nearly all of these would be males by the way case you

40:18.320 --> 40:22.960
think gender doesn't matter there are most likely people who would kill the

40:22.960 --> 40:28.000
blue jays for fun so once they learned for example that you could bring a blue

40:28.000 --> 40:41.640
jay to your hand with a peanut they would do so for nefarious purposes the

40:41.640 --> 40:51.640
other day I was in a part of the garden where there's a scrub jay that knows me

40:52.080 --> 41:03.960
by the way that jay remembered me I fed it one time like five years ago and that

41:03.960 --> 41:11.400
jay remembered me every time it saw me thereafter the animals have their

41:11.400 --> 41:17.240
memories are unencumbered by representation so they have a lot of

41:17.520 --> 41:28.760
memory resource to enact it's funny what a long road it's taking me to get back

41:28.760 --> 41:42.200
to my original motivational thought here that started this this topic so for some

41:42.240 --> 41:59.000
birds the appearance of a peanut is so compelling that they become like their

41:59.000 --> 42:06.320
nervous system actually divides against itself and their ordinary instincts

42:06.320 --> 42:14.960
for self and companion protection at least briefly collapse into must get

42:14.960 --> 42:26.640
that peanut before something else does and so this messes up their vigilance

42:26.880 --> 42:39.920
activities now a brief you know a brief

42:43.680 --> 42:53.520
divergence from protocol probably won't get you killed at least not the first time

42:57.600 --> 43:06.120
oh yeah see I was just feeding them and a hawk has come one of the coopers has

43:06.120 --> 43:18.480
come to see oh it was turned away from you know it's hunting I respect that hawk

43:18.880 --> 43:30.720
and have felt its talons because again ignorance got in trouble with the hawks

43:30.720 --> 43:39.920
so there are some kinds of stimulus and you know the humans have the same problem this

43:39.920 --> 43:48.480
is why social media has become a terrifying this manipulative disease you can see that

43:48.480 --> 43:54.000
the goal is to capture attention which has for some time been the new form of cash

43:55.680 --> 44:02.880
and this is natural for an organism that's collapsing away from participatory relation

44:03.840 --> 44:11.360
meaningful roles and relationships into representations money porn social media

44:12.160 --> 44:25.520
shows video games etc the coyote can't help it it's not powerless but it's nearly powerless

44:25.520 --> 44:33.120
when the siren is near it directly captures its nervous system and this is what happens to us

44:33.920 --> 44:38.400
with our technologies we undergo nervous system capture

44:40.720 --> 44:46.960
now there's a blue jay in a part of the garden that remembers me from a long time ago a couple

44:46.960 --> 45:00.080
weeks ago I was I gave it a peanut and because it's a male and it knows me it will come to my hand

45:00.960 --> 45:08.960
now by the way that's a particularly interesting situation let me explain why

45:09.760 --> 45:18.080
if I put the peanut on the ground or on a branch the jay must do if it wants to live

45:19.040 --> 45:30.560
it's going to check maybe between eight and 30 vectors before it moves and then when it lands

45:30.560 --> 45:36.160
it will recheck those vectors ordinarily the jay will have a companion up high

45:37.120 --> 45:41.760
they can directly check with to see if it can't if there's something it can't see yet

45:44.160 --> 45:55.440
and this complex participated relationship of mutual positive vigilance keeps both jays safe

45:58.720 --> 45:59.600
relatively well

46:00.160 --> 46:14.480
now if instead I am aware that there's a male and the male knows me I hold out a peanut in my hand

46:17.600 --> 46:26.160
the male can be relatively certain that it can cross the interval between its perch and my palm

46:26.720 --> 46:30.400
safely because it's a very short interval and it's fast

46:32.960 --> 46:41.840
and grabbing the peanut from my outstretched hand it doesn't have to do a bunch of vector checking

46:43.040 --> 46:53.760
because a hawk is very unlikely to attempt to take a jay from a human palm

46:56.560 --> 47:06.960
unless the hawk has previously succeeded at such an endeavor so in a way the male's

47:08.240 --> 47:09.760
willingness to come to my hand

47:12.320 --> 47:13.440
is a bit more safe

47:21.280 --> 47:22.400
than coming to ground

47:27.120 --> 47:33.760
huh what's she shooting oh I see sparrows are eating seeds in a bush

47:35.520 --> 47:37.440
interesting that we call photography shooting

47:41.120 --> 47:43.360
leads to a whole other conversation wherein

47:47.840 --> 47:53.200
human vision is understood to be a complex series of rays

47:53.600 --> 48:02.880
that travel out from the eye bouncing back from the things these rays touch

48:07.280 --> 48:12.560
so in a sense the male that comes to my hand is fairly safe

48:14.480 --> 48:18.720
and as long as such interactions between me and the birds are infrequent

48:23.200 --> 48:30.320
it's unlikely to produce their death unless there's something wrong with the peanuts

48:32.480 --> 48:37.520
or conceivably but awfully unlikely

48:40.880 --> 48:45.920
they acquire some microbe from my skin surface or something

48:46.320 --> 48:54.720
so I was feeding this this male and there were a couple of men approaching and they saw the

48:54.720 --> 49:05.280
bird come to my hand and they said uh do you speak with birds and I playfully said doesn't everyone

49:05.520 --> 49:16.240
laugh and made some comment like well I don't I don't see the birds coming to the hands of people

49:17.120 --> 49:23.040
here's a male scrub jay that knows me so now I will do the thing that I was just talking about

49:23.040 --> 49:30.960
where the bird comes to hand and he lands briefly on my hand when he grabs the peanut now if there's

49:30.960 --> 49:39.520
a female around I can put I'll usually put a peanut out for her

49:47.920 --> 49:51.680
so that she can also have the benefit of

49:52.400 --> 50:02.160
what a birder I know called bird heroine which he meant peanuts so yeah the guys said said this to me

50:03.120 --> 50:06.960
and I said well

50:11.520 --> 50:14.480
peanut is a language understood by many birds

50:16.800 --> 50:17.680
and they laughed

50:21.760 --> 50:22.560
so

50:26.560 --> 50:31.360
you know the humans do some degree of monkey see monkey do

50:33.760 --> 50:40.400
so additionally if I'm out in public and I'm witnessed relating with animals by giving them food

50:41.200 --> 50:47.360
creates problems very unlikely that other humans are even

50:47.840 --> 50:54.960
even similarly sensitive to the well-being of the creatures that I am and I've made terrible mistakes

50:56.400 --> 51:01.680
not on purpose so yeah I put some in danger

51:05.280 --> 51:08.800
and what I was thinking when I began this walk and talk was

51:10.880 --> 51:14.960
there's some crows that know me and

51:18.240 --> 51:22.400
when I'm near them when I'm near their their terrain

51:24.640 --> 51:26.720
they group up and follow me

51:31.440 --> 51:32.720
and people might see this

51:35.120 --> 51:41.760
and I wonder what they would think if they noticed I mean I often wonder if people think actually at

51:41.760 --> 51:49.520
all but I wonder what they would think if they saw you know five crows following me up

51:49.520 --> 51:58.160
up or down some street in the city and I thought that they might think I'm a witch

51:58.960 --> 52:08.960
human's naturally

52:11.600 --> 52:17.200
surveil each other and they do so sometimes in obvious ways and sometimes surreptitiously

52:18.800 --> 52:22.080
I was just being surveyed surveilled by a male in the garden

52:22.720 --> 52:30.480
so yeah I wonder what the humans might think but the thing that I find interesting is that

52:31.520 --> 52:36.720
there's a very clear pecking order in the group of approximately five crows

52:38.640 --> 52:45.760
that know me well and I give them peanuts sometimes

52:46.080 --> 52:52.880
so they know that I am

52:55.520 --> 53:03.840
I'm gonna bring them something good to eat and it's winter harder to get food colder need more

53:04.880 --> 53:12.160
need more fuel it's very it's relatively easy to discern the genders

53:13.120 --> 53:16.160
in the corvids behaviorally

53:19.360 --> 53:21.600
I have almost never seen if ever

53:26.880 --> 53:29.840
a female who's relatively adventurous and aggressive

53:34.400 --> 53:39.600
whereas the males the males will come right down and grab a peanut and

53:40.480 --> 53:45.040
they won't merely grab a peanut they'll check the other peanuts they'll like do a weight test

53:45.040 --> 53:50.480
they'll try to figure out which peanut is best so they might pick up with their beaks three or four

53:50.480 --> 53:57.360
peanuts before the females even get near the food and

54:02.400 --> 54:08.320
so that creates a problem where it's difficult to get a peanut to the females at all

54:10.560 --> 54:16.240
um the male crows have a craw so that they can

54:19.040 --> 54:27.440
store one probably one peanut maybe two if we're talking raven

54:27.840 --> 54:29.280
um

54:31.440 --> 54:31.840
and

54:36.480 --> 54:39.680
so they can grab up you know most of the peanuts

54:41.200 --> 54:44.880
and and the females are so timid in in this particular group

54:47.680 --> 54:52.960
that although they may land near where the males are grabbing peanuts

54:53.760 --> 55:02.160
and they may make some tentative passes toward peanuts um what you will notice

55:04.400 --> 55:10.000
with crows and ravens is they have a complex neurological behavior where

55:12.640 --> 55:17.520
they all make a pass at something they intend to grab and then bounce

55:18.480 --> 55:24.160
right like leap backward leap away they'll make a pass towards something and leap away from it

55:24.880 --> 55:28.640
and when they grab something they'll leap away from from it even though they've got it

55:30.880 --> 55:38.880
and this seems to be a what humans call an instinctual behavior most corvids share it

55:39.520 --> 55:44.000
I imagine I haven't seen all the different kinds of corvids I've rarely been able to

55:44.080 --> 55:50.240
observe magpies um I think I've seen one in my life for a few minutes in real life

55:51.200 --> 55:56.240
though I have sometimes observed them in video by the way there's a bunch of

55:57.920 --> 56:00.000
so convocation of crows

56:02.240 --> 56:03.760
and they seem stirred up

56:14.080 --> 56:21.520
yes I am speaking of your people please do not poop right on my head

56:31.120 --> 56:34.800
so interesting the foreground background feature of vision because

56:35.600 --> 56:38.320
in the foreground I see the crows and in the background there's these

56:38.320 --> 56:41.440
like

56:43.760 --> 56:47.600
visually challenging puffs of cloud

56:50.240 --> 56:57.040
that what I mean by visually challenging is that they

56:59.440 --> 57:02.560
if you look at one area of the cloud forms

57:04.480 --> 57:05.840
the others seem

57:08.320 --> 57:10.080
the others

57:15.120 --> 57:23.360
could almost be in motion the kind of motion that one sees in anything in the foveal vision

57:24.240 --> 57:32.560
under the influence of psychedelics this kind of internal efflorescing outward

57:33.040 --> 57:37.200
like transformational non-motion

57:40.720 --> 57:49.520
that envision probably due to forms of neural feedback still things appear to be moving

57:50.160 --> 57:55.440
the whole context may appear to be breathing so forth so the clouds are kind of

57:56.400 --> 57:58.720
um relevant with this

58:00.960 --> 58:08.400
interior spirit or energy although I am not under the influence of any drugs at the moment

58:09.840 --> 58:12.800
unless you consider peanuts a drug I did eat a couple

58:17.360 --> 58:24.560
so it's hard to get peanuts to the crow girls and I have a natural

58:25.920 --> 58:26.560
um

58:29.440 --> 58:30.160
tropism

58:38.960 --> 58:48.000
for the underdog for the little one for the rejected one for the outsider so forth

58:48.960 --> 58:51.600
so

58:53.840 --> 59:00.560
I remember one beautiful afternoon fairly safe this this I think where I walked to the ocean

59:00.560 --> 59:06.720
after not having seen it in many many years and I brought some peanuts with me and it turned out

59:06.720 --> 59:15.840
that when I got there I encountered an enclave of ravens and so first thing I think I did

59:16.400 --> 59:19.040
I'm not really sure actually which thing came first let me be

59:20.080 --> 59:26.000
we speak with integrity about this I'm not sure I may have given them peanuts first

59:27.120 --> 59:29.680
I may have sang to them first

59:33.680 --> 59:41.840
but both things were offerings of respect and uh honoring them

59:41.840 --> 59:52.800
honoring their people and their spirit honoring our communal

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.080
relationship

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:14.640
and I remember that there was one raven

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.320
it's funny how emotionally effective

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:31.440
a affect effective this is for me affect

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.040
when I remember this I'm starting to choke up

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.320
there was one raven

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:54.800
there might have been a few ravens that I could visibly detect ticks around their eyes

01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:00.480
but there was one raven who its eyes were surrounded with ticks

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:09.280
and if you've ever watched young young crows and ravens

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.160
you will commonly see brother and sister pairs preening each other

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.280
and maybe brother and brother pairs maybe sister and sister pairs

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:28.960
I don't know how common it is that a clutch produces one male and one female

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:35.680
but you will see them preening each other

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:40.080
right they will come very close together on a telephone wire or something

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.560
and they will preen each other or one of them will preen the other and they will

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.760
request you can see them request preening

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:56.400
and I knew as I was looking at the raven with all of the ticks

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.400
that it was not treated well by the rest of the

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.200
they can be very mean in their in their social pods

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.040
corvids well the crows and the ravens at least

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.240
if the jays form extended communities I've not seen them

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:31.760
I know that magpies seem to but what I realized when looking at the the raven was

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:39.120
first of all obviously this bird is not being preened

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:44.400
and it cannot remove the ticks but any other creature could

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:54.880
any of those jays any any of those ravens excuse me could have preened it

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:05.040
and they would have received a tasty nutritious insect meal by so new me

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:09.680
at least you know in my thinking confused as it may be

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:22.720
so I worked extra hard to make sure that raven got some peanuts

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:35.200
and having fed them and sung to them I walked up the

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:50.480
I walked up the shoreline where was I walking north I guess I can't remember probably

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:56.480
I walked up the shoreline and I acquired an entourage of ravens

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:10.320
so either you know if someone were watching me they would either think this is a magically potent

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:20.160
person very few people would think that or they would wonder why they wouldn't have a conjecture

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:27.200
they just wonder what the hell is going on here or they would intelligently infer that I had given

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:45.680
them food it's pretty hard to get a peanut to the girls in the little crow enclave

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.960
but what I noticed the other day that I thought was great

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:57.120
was that it appeared to me that one of the males cashed a peanut in his

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:58.960
his claw

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.480
and then when the other crows weren't on the ground

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:15.760
exuded the peanut for the bird that I imagined to be his sister

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:22.960
or could be his mate to consume and I thought that was really cool

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:36.160
you know I life is very challenging and difficult and much more so in a world filled with machines

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:48.640
and perhaps somewhat naively I believe I'm an extreme altruist an exalt

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:56.800
um in Andrea Kuzhevsky's nomenclature

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:06.400
I generally will travel in the direction of mutual benefit naturally

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:16.880
in any way that I can understand how to do so my heart is more intelligent than my brain at this

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:24.880
time much more intelligent and so I get confused by my thoughts

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.840
often I make mistakes

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:46.960
there's an explanation for the complexity of the human brain that I prefer

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:55.600
which is that we might not be the alpha symbiont

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:04.320
and what I mean by that is something really weird I don't mean the symbiont that dominates

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:12.560
overall others or is the most important I mean the symbiont

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:21.360
that naturally becomes the summation lens of all of the other intelligences around it

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:27.840
all the forms of intelligence produced by starfish fungal microbial

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:38.080
vegetal animal land creatures water creatures air creatures living place being skybeam

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:43.360
all these intelligences and

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:50.400
you know I think the humans have this role

01:07:53.520 --> 01:08:07.920
there's a bunch of very intense child signaling going on there

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.920
so

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:20.880
pause for a moment here while a loud noise doesn't get recorded

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:34.000
it seems to me that I've said this before in a very real sense the human species is the

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.120
the arbiter

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:51.040
of the well-being or destruction of everything that isn't too small for us to see and much of what is

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.840
so whether or not

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:04.240
some creator god divinely mandated that we were the shepherds for life on earth

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:13.440
it turns out to be the case by fiat or by uh by function anyway

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:32.000
now I think there are other similar alpha symbionts like us on earth

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:40.480
and some of the microbial ones might be far more profound in the scope of their

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:44.800
relationships than we tend to be

01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:06.720
clearly in the waters the whales and dolphins represent living summation lenses of the aquatic

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:08.720
intelligences

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.760
how ironic the humans would slaughter them thereby denying themselves access to those organs of

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:27.200
intelligence perception and relation for what for the commodities their dead bodies produce

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:36.000
those are so worth pennies on the trillions of dollars of what is being disposed of as

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.200
usual for humans trapped in representational cognition

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.280
but yes our form has incredible unique

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:58.800
monumentally profound faculties and abilities that are disposed of almost entirely by our

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:03.280
representational behavior cognition

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.280
our great forgetting our our amnesia

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.800
our actively self-generating amnesia

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:34.560
so I like to think that

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:47.360
the complexity of the physical organ that we refer to as our brains pretending it's

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:51.200
distinct again pretending that

01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:01.200
obvious it should be blatantly obvious that again one organism first the singularity of

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.520
the organism has precedence to any organ by many orders of magnitude so that

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:15.760
if you say the word brain you're actually referring to the entire body and the extended

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:21.600
environmental relationships and the entire history of life on earth and the

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.160
potential and future of life on this planet

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.480
because there is no brain without a heart you don't have a brain without kidneys

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:36.320
no skin no brain no mouth no brain

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:43.280
there are certain organs you can do away with and still have a brain

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.080
but not most of them

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:56.640
and the humans are doing the same damn thing to the earth right they are they are ripping the

01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:03.520
organs of the earth out selling them on the black market for cars and guns and bombs and

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:09.760
shit and terror and torture and cages and awfulness the species

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.640
can't tell if this guy's yelling at himself or if he's yelling at his phone

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:28.480
so yeah I mean if the earth is a single animal and the humans are an organ of that animal

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.720
they are an organ destroying organ of that animal

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:38.400
most of us have no desire to be anything resembling that

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:48.800
and ordinarily we would have a fairly minimal and perhaps relatively net positive effect

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:58.720
on the biosphere and the environment particularly if our population were limited

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:08.720
but also if the object population that we produce were dramatically limited

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:11.920
this is interesting

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:24.000
many people complain about the human population certainly it's a problem

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:31.120
but the actual problem seems to me not to be the number of human bodies but rather what the masses

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:37.920
of them tend to do and one of those things is madly proliferate objects

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:47.520
and thus create from living beings and places effectively garbage and machines

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:57.440
so I think there's another explanation for the complexity of our brains

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:06.560
which is that the meta organism that earth is naturally produces in her organs

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:22.800
complex meta symbionts capable of astonishing feats of symbiotic sensing relation cognition

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:33.760
participation so forth and the more of those the earth has the the more alive her own

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:44.160
this creates webs of jewels in the net of her transcendentions

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:56.160
expanding it dramatically to whatever degree those meta metacognitives and meta symbionts

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:06.240
uh remain true to the beautiful and noble and heroic missions of living beings

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.080
on a delicate world in time space

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.280
there's a my foot there's a little plastic elephant

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:25.280
or maybe it's a pig

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:33.760
I wonder how many billions of those we've produced while the elephants and pigs were slaughtered

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:42.320
you know at the species level we are deadly poisoned to living worlds presently in our in

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:50.720
our current whatever is orienting our groups is malignant fundamentally malignant and life

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:57.680
despising intelligence despising because any intelligence that tears itself to shreds must

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:08.480
fail to qualify and similarly any intelligence that attacks its own foundations in relation

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:17.040
and organism must fail to qualify it's not clear at all individual humans are can be relatively

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:26.240
intelligent small groups of bonded humans can be preternaturally intelligent but large disoriented

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:32.800
cohorts of humans tend to be omnicidal in our time and that's a game with a short future

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:39.680
so one thing that I want to encourage you to do and I'm going to try and take my

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:43.680
own advice here is get together with a small group of other intelligent humans

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:54.320
and come up with a mission that you all believe in and go on have that adventure together in the

01:17:54.320 --> 01:18:04.640
living world very hard to emulate that sound

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:14.320
it's funny there's there's ravens right above me

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:22.640
and one has to wonder if right if this is accidental

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:34.640
so

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:40.640
it's a pair

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:50.320
now I can't tell what their signals mean so I can't really tell

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:54.960
if they're upset

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:58.960
right I can't really tell

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:06.800
if they're upset at my behavior I've been circling a tree if they're curious

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.040
or something else

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:22.320
if we want to experience the potentials of our intelligence our dreaming aspects

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.160
our transcendence as human beings

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:33.120
there are paths where this can be pursued in isolation

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:38.880
but if you want an accelerant

01:19:43.760 --> 01:20:00.080
go with trusted others into adventure meaningful relation meaningful roles nick names private lexicons

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:09.360
explore the palm that unites the fingers and you will never be disappointed

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.000
you might have misadventures things may go wrong but even from those you will learn

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:28.880
very profoundly and quickly and you will develop new senses new abilities new perspectives

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:34.160
so it turns out the guy that was yelling nearby is yelling into his phone

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:47.440
I wish you beautiful lives and ways companions adventures love and play and creativity

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:58.640
and I look forward to learning together again very soon thank you for joining me bye bye for now

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:00.640
you
