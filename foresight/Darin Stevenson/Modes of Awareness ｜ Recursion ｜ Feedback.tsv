0	5000	Hello everybody. Welcome.
15000	21000	I had a dream. I've had many dreams.
22000	27000	Even some visions occasionally. I know the difference.
30000	37000	Which, I can't say that I'm a visionary.
37000	42000	But I've had a couple of visions.
42000	46000	I definitely know the difference between that and a dream.
46000	51000	A vision, for me anyway, my experience of them.
51000	56000	They happen during a very specific time
56000	62000	in which my mind was in an unusual
62000	67000	array of ways.
76000	81000	And both times, it was in the daytime
81000	86000	and suddenly out of nowhere I had to lie down
86000	91000	in a moment I lay down.
91000	95000	In a kind of dreaming experience.
95000	100000	That's unusually what?
100000	105000	Local. Very local. Feels like it's right here.
105000	110000	And then I see.
110000	118000	I see features of the people who are coming to my home.
118000	123000	In one case, a doctor.
123000	128000	I should have understood those symbols.
128000	132000	In one case, a doctor who I'd never seen before.
132000	137000	And in another case, a helper.
140000	144000	In both cases I saw, effectively,
144000	148000	specific features of their situation in life
148000	152000	that I could not have otherwise possibly have known
152000	156000	that were accurate.
156000	160000	I'm not saying this to take any credit.
160000	164000	This is not the kind of thing I could reproduce at will.
164000	168000	It's not like I have a skill necessarily or I have a gift.
168000	173000	It's more like under conditions,
173000	178000	under unusual conditions where the stakes are very high
178000	182000	and consciousness is still somewhat coherent.
182000	187000	So it's like a high stress situation perhaps.
188000	196000	Other forms of sensing arise in our direct experience.
196000	199000	And yes, of course it's a problem.
199000	201000	Why is it a problem?
201000	206000	Because most of the time we're in an ordinary mode of mind
206000	215000	which lets be really clear
215000	218000	is mostly shut down.
218000	221000	If you have 70 senses in your ordinary mode of mind
221000	224000	you've got four, maybe six.
224000	228000	In your ordinary mode of mind you'll see from one perspective,
228000	233000	one array of values,
233000	237000	one or maybe two purposes at most.
237000	242000	In a non-ordinary situation
242000	245000	it's almost the opposite.
245000	250000	You'll see for seven reasons from five perspectives,
250000	252000	19 purposes.
252000	255000	You don't have to know what each one is either.
255000	259000	You just naturally have an increased dimensionality
259000	262000	and how is that increased dimensionality expressed?
262000	265000	It's expressed symbolically.
265000	280000	So the doctor was depicted as a short man
280000	284000	with a cast on his left forearm,
284000	290000	a shaggy dog behind a curtain in a small room.
290000	297000	The doctor turned out to be unusually short.
297000	307000	Maybe four, eight, four, nine.
307000	312000	He did not have a cast on his left arm
312000	316000	but at home it turned out he had in fact a shaggy dog
316000	319000	that was often in his office
319000	328000	which is a small room behind a curtain in his home.
328000	330000	Now of course you're listening to this
330000	333000	in the future of my experience
333000	336000	and I can't provide evidence
336000	348000	that what I experienced in my visionary trance
348000	352000	is what I am saying it is.
352000	355000	This is my honest recollection about that event.
355000	359000	There were a couple of other features
359000	365000	because it's so long ago I can't remember.
365000	370000	It was a very similar situation with the helper
370000	375000	in which I accurately described her partner
375000	378000	and knew symbolically some things about him
378000	381000	that were definitely pertinent
381000	383000	to the degree that she laughed
383000	385000	and thought like that's hilarious,
385000	387000	how could anyone know this?
387000	392000	Because she understood the symbols as well.
392000	396000	One of them was a very shiny bowler hat
396000	398000	but I cannot recall why she thought
398000	401000	that was perfect and important.
401000	405000	That was a long time ago.
405000	410000	So we have a reasonable concern
410000	414000	about what we call delusions
414000	421000	and we have a reasonable concern about insanity.
421000	424000	The way we make sense of our own identity
424000	426000	and its relationship to the world
426000	429000	is actually a fairly delicate arrangement
429000	431000	of inhibitions.
431000	434000	And this delicate arrangement of inhibitions
434000	437000	gets forged half intentionally,
437000	439000	half accidentally,
439000	441000	it's not a 50-50 thing,
441000	446000	partly intentionally, partly accidentally,
446000	450000	partly for coping, partly for play,
450000	453000	partly for compliance,
453000	457000	partly to fulfill various narratives
457000	462000	or expectations.
462000	466000	Yeah, this interface of self and world
466000	471000	and self-to-self, self-to-world
471000	475000	and world-to-self, this interface,
475000	477000	it's very complicated.
477000	479000	We have a thing called a private,
479000	482000	we could call a private face
482000	487000	which is what we see to ourselves
487000	491000	if we really look carefully, openly.
491000	496000	And then we have various layers of other faces.
496000	501000	You know, closest companions, parents,
501000	505000	more distant companions but close
505000	507000	and so forth on out to strangers
507000	509000	and then on out to possible strangers
509000	511000	and out from there to the world itself
511000	514000	or some nation or some cohort,
514000	519000	a religion, a political party,
519000	522000	some faction of humans
522000	526000	that share who knows what strange biases,
526000	531000	imperatives, predilections,
531000	535000	insanities, fictions, beliefs,
535000	542000	faiths, sciences, who knows.
542000	544000	Well, you can see how complex it is
544000	548000	because, for example, if we're at all interested in science,
548000	551000	then we have a face that faces science inside us
551000	556000	where we see ourselves from a scientific face.
556000	559000	If we have a face that knows a little bit about medicine,
559000	561000	then that face faces us inwardly.
561000	563000	We decide, like, am I sick?
563000	565000	Do I have a fever?
565000	567000	We're using a very special aspect of consciousness
567000	569000	when we do this and we're collapsing
569000	571000	the entire range of consciousness
571000	578000	into one of its possible modes.
578000	581000	The mode of doctor, am I sick?
581000	583000	Which we have modeled.
583000	585000	How have we modeled this?
585000	589000	Am I seeing doctors portrayed?
589000	592000	Perhaps by being cared for by them,
592000	596000	by being cared for by parents or other elders,
596000	599000	possibly by being cared for by siblings,
599000	603000	possibly by caring for siblings, friends, elders,
603000	606000	in situations where there's trouble.
606000	609000	When people are saying,
609000	611000	I wonder what consciousness is,
611000	614000	I wonder if they're fucking thinking about consciousness.
614000	616000	What are they thinking about?
616000	618000	They're not thinking about consciousness
618000	621000	because that stuff is so complex.
621000	626000	It's the thing they're asking the question with.
626000	628000	So if we have a science-facing self
628000	630000	and a medicine-facing self
630000	632000	and a psychology-facing self
632000	634000	and a myth-facing self,
634000	636000	all these inside us, right?
636000	638000	And never mind what we face outside
638000	640000	in what we can at least imagine
640000	645000	as cohorts that might observe and evaluate us.
645000	648000	They might ignore us.
648000	652000	They might, yeah, this is the stuff.
652000	656000	That is the stuff that stung me when I was little.
656000	660000	I wonder if it's a nettle.
660000	663000	Just touch this plant and it stung me.
663000	668000	I wonder what that is.
668000	673000	So think about how sophisticated your persona is.
673000	676000	It's ordinarily in a superposition of states,
676000	679000	we might say, transferring a metaphor
679000	681000	from quantum mechanics, right?
681000	682000	It's not this or that.
682000	685000	It's not you or not you, right?
685000	687000	It's in a superposition of states.
687000	690000	And then something acquires your attention
690000	692000	and it begins to collapse towards, say,
692000	697000	two or three of them at the same time.
697000	704000	Comedian, athlete, physical, keep walking.
704000	709000	Race car driver, avoid that wreck.
709000	711000	You know, naturalist.
711000	715000	What's that plant, animal, bird, insect, et cetera?
715000	723000	That plant stung me good.
723000	726000	See, it's written, okay, now look at what just happened.
726000	728000	All right?
728000	732000	I started talking about playing the doctor.
732000	734000	What's the next thing that happened?
734000	736000	I got stung by a plant.
736000	739000	And that's actually what took place.
739000	743000	So I'm sitting here, part of my finger is stinging.
743000	747000	It's a little bit blotchier than it probably should be.
747000	751000	It doesn't look like a rash yet.
751000	757000	And I'm collapsing my faculties toward
757000	759000	checking the severity of the situation, right?
759000	762000	And evaluating how severe is this?
762000	764000	Does it need attention?
764000	767000	Am I okay?
767000	769000	Is it going to bubble up into little pustules
769000	771000	like when I was a kid and was playing in this stuff
771000	774000	one day with my friend Mark?
774000	780000	But anyway, my point is,
780000	784000	within us, to some degree, to a unique degree,
784000	787000	and to different degrees in different situations
787000	792000	and times of our lives, we become,
792000	795000	we collapse the manifold of our identity,
795000	802000	intelligence, awareness, consciousness, emotion, sensation.
802000	805000	And then as it collapses and becomes highly structured
805000	812000	and specialized, an action ensues, right?
812000	816000	I lift my finger and carefully examine the place where it stings.
816000	819000	For example, or I formulate the sentence
819000	821000	that I am speaking right now.
821000	824000	Do you see how pervasive this little toy is?
824000	826000	So we're doing this all the time,
826000	828000	but we don't think that way.
828000	832000	We think, well, I know who Darren is.
832000	837000	He's a coherent array of habits that I'm well familiar with.
837000	842000	In fact, to be entirely honest, no one,
842000	845000	with the possible exception of divine beings or so forth,
845000	849000	no one is as familiar with Darren as I am.
849000	856000	I am the one who experiences Darren and also enacts him.
856000	859000	So I would think I know everything that's going on,
859000	862000	but I don't because I think I'm one guy
862000	867000	and there's nothing like that going on.
867000	874000	You know, if you painted a label on a blurry waterfall of states,
875000	881000	you sculpt some word in steel, cold.
881000	884000	You put it behind the waterfall, okay?
884000	887000	The waterfall may indeed be cool.
887000	892000	It might even be cold, but that doesn't help anyone.
892000	893000	And that's kind of what we do.
893000	896000	We think, you know, I am a me.
896000	899000	It's not untrue and it's most of our experience,
899000	909000	but what happens when enough of the me disappears
909000	917000	that the more than merely me can arise, signal, dance,
917000	925000	express itself, see, know, feel, show?
925000	927000	What happens then?
927000	930000	The more than merely me.
930000	932000	Well, here's a couple things that happen.
932000	941000	Art, medicine, science, heroism, war, sports, music, dance, you know,
941000	953000	speech, sex, rescue, all kinds of things happen.
954000	958000	From the more than merely me.
958000	967000	And so normally, you know, we like our normalcy because it feels safe
967000	969000	and predictable and comfortable.
969000	972000	We think, oh, I know what's going on, quote, unquote.
972000	975000	Good luck with that.
975000	978000	That's a convenient fiction.
978000	983000	If anything serious happened, whether it was seriously beautiful,
983000	989000	seriously puzzling, or seriously violent,
989000	996000	you would quickly realize that the mind with which you're comfortable
996000	1007000	is almost useless and more like a prison than a sanctuary.
1007000	1014000	Because sanctuary, and yeah, I'm thinking about Logan's run right here,
1014000	1022000	straight up, sanctuary exists, but it's not a place.
1022000	1032000	It's a way of being human, facing ourselves with others facing us,
1032000	1035000	facing others, facing the world with the world facing us,
1035000	1038000	facing the sky with the sky facing us.
1038000	1048000	It's a way of authentically opening the valves, so to speak,
1048000	1054000	on the puzzle blocks in which our awareness, consciousness, identity,
1054000	1060000	expectations, emotions, and sensations are usually trapped.
1060000	1067000	And that box necessarily represents, I don't know, like two hundredths of our nature
1067000	1081000	and natural ability, our needs, our senses, our faculties,
1081000	1092000	our ways of seeing and knowing and learning, growing, playing, healing, remembering.
1092000	1101000	That last one might be the most important.
1101000	1113000	I had a dream that I was in a prison where my friend, a friend of mine is in prison.
1113000	1122000	And then I woke up and it seemed like, well, it wasn't too tough in the prison situation.
1122000	1128000	Things were okay in there, actually.
1128000	1132000	It wasn't a lot of danger, bad people, or anything like that.
1132000	1139000	It was just very constrained.
1139000	1142000	A couple times in the dream I got a little bit nervous.
1142000	1147000	And then I woke up and I thought, oh, I'm not in a prison.
1147000	1149000	That's nice. I didn't actually think that.
1149000	1151000	I just thought, hmm, I can remember the dream.
1151000	1153000	Actually, that's what I actually thought.
1153000	1161000	Because I can remember features of the dream.
1161000	1169000	And then I listened to a podcast.
1169000	1177000	Well, various things happened, but I ended up walking around listening to a podcast
1178000	1183000	called Third Eye Drops.
1183000	1190000	It was something like the ancients knew how to escape the simulation.
1190000	1197000	Now, I want to kind of blur that word simulation
1197000	1211000	because it conjures computational contexts and structures.
1211000	1219000	I want to blur that word.
1219000	1227000	What do I want to call it?
1227000	1233000	It's not actually a simulation.
1233000	1236000	Well, I don't know what it is, first of all.
1236000	1249000	My experience of it resembles a complex array of obfuscating lenses
1249000	1259000	that when reality shines through them lead to lesser stasis or hypostasis
1259000	1264000	that don't present things that are merely illusory.
1264000	1267000	They're not merely illusory.
1267000	1274000	Nor are they necessarily a simulation like a machine would make.
1274000	1281000	Even if they were, they'd have to be simulations of something.
1281000	1284000	So I think simulation is the wrong word.
1284000	1286000	You need a much better word.
1286000	1292000	Hypostasis isn't bad.
1292000	1299000	How can we illustrate what a hypostasis is?
1299000	1303000	It's an actual metaphor.
1303000	1312000	Come on, universe.
1312000	1319000	There's a mountain in the world and there's a representation of the mountain on the map.
1319000	1323000	And then there's the representation of the intersection between the mountain on the map
1323000	1326000	and the mountain in our mind.
1326000	1330000	So actually the last one is the intersection is between the mountain in the world,
1330000	1335000	the mountain on the map, and the mountain in our mind.
1335000	1339000	That's a specific intersection.
1339000	1343000	So the mountain on the map is a hypostasis.
1343000	1347000	The mountain in the mind is a very strange thing indeed.
1347000	1351000	And it's not merely a hypostasis.
1351000	1355000	It makes use of both features.
1355000	1359000	The hypostasis, which is probably the universe.
1359000	1361000	I mean, the hypostasis looks crazy.
1361000	1362000	It's a tunnel.
1362000	1368000	It's got like origin, universe, galaxy, solar systems.
1368000	1380000	This solar system, this star, this earth, this moon, then planetary topology local to earth,
1380000	1388000	then the actual planetary topologies of earth at this moment and whatever in a timeline.
1388000	1397000	I mean, yeah, the hypostasis is very complex.
1398000	1410000	The problem is it's almost always useful to have new dimensions in which one can see sense,
1410000	1422000	know, learn, test, play, reflect, understand,
1422000	1429000	metaphorize to metaphorize.
1429000	1435000	It's often good to have more dimensions, but you need coherent.
1435000	1450000	We need coherent introduction of dimensions, which is something dreaming usually does to some degree.
1450000	1466000	And some forms of cognitive or intellectual or philosophical pursuit are similar.
1466000	1486000	The podcast I was listening to on third eye drops was revealing some unusually discussed information about Plato's allegory of the cave in, I think, the republic.
1486000	1489000	And the host had some interesting stuff to share.
1489000	1509000	But what the host was saying, which is something most people who know about the cave allegory are at least familiar with, is that we're trapped in a kind of reduced dimensionality sensorium.
1510000	1518000	And the dimensionality isn't, it's not in an escapable situation.
1518000	1531000	The problem is that compared to what we're used to seeing, what's actually going on is terrifyingly profound, beautiful, momentous, and so forth.
1531000	1543000	So we tend to stay tethered up in the packaged goods version of existence.
1543000	1546000	And no one would say they would want that.
1546000	1548000	I wouldn't say I want that.
1548000	1550000	By the way, my finger is fine.
1550000	1553000	There's the doctor coming back online for a moment.
1554000	1559000	I'm just checking in on my finger with gut stung.
1559000	1562000	Consciousness collapsing to one of its modes.
1562000	1568000	Well, what if we could collapse consciousness into three to five modes at the same time instead of one?
1568000	1569000	That's what children do.
1569000	1572000	That's what brilliant humans do.
1572000	1576000	That's probably what gods do.
1576000	1580000	Pretty sure if there are aliens, they're doing it.
1580000	1582000	Spirit beings?
1582000	1585000	Yep, they're up to that for sure.
1585000	1586000	Trees?
1586000	1587000	Probably doing that.
1587000	1588000	Fish?
1588000	1590000	Bet they're doing it.
1590000	1591000	The sky?
1591000	1595000	Pure doing of that.
1595000	1611000	The sky is like, yeah, I'm stars and galaxies and black holes and quasars and nebula, starbirth nurseries, neutron stars and jupiters.
1611000	1618000	So there's like, yeah, I'm like one thing.
1618000	1628000	I mean, it's obviously time space is a meta position, a superposition over the whole category of identities we have on here.
1628000	1637000	The problem is really that you don't want, okay, once you start being presented with symbolic information,
1637000	1642000	unless you have a coherent sort of what?
1642000	1648000	I guess I'm going to call it, I'm going to be kind of clinical, unless your observation body is coherent.
1648000	1651000	You're going to go nuts.
1651000	1658000	And the symbols themselves are not always coherent.
1658000	1666000	You know, like the whole situation, you're talking about an interface between, I don't know, a whole bunch of stuff.
1666000	1677000	The history of life on earth, minds, the between of the self and the world and the universe and the sky and so forth,
1677000	1680000	that between and where these two things overlap.
1680000	1682000	And let's face it, they're the same thing.
1682000	1684000	So if they're overlapping, what's happening?
1684000	1686000	They're folding back on each other, right?
1686000	1693000	So if your consciousness is focused out into the world, what it's doing is it's folding back onto its own origin.
1693000	1695000	Can you see that?
1695000	1701000	When you're doing the naturalist thing and you're watching the dolphins or whatever,
1701000	1707000	you're folding back your awareness right onto your own origin.
1707000	1713000	And this produces feedback and awareness, like bubbling waves, right?
1713000	1717000	Like a sort of a place where a wave meets a wave kind of thing.
1717000	1721000	So you see the flowers and you think, oh, it's beautiful, right?
1721000	1722000	It's a recursion.
1722000	1731000	You're seeing, I mean, you're seeing like nine different things at least, probably a billion or endless numbers, infinite things.
1731000	1738000	But light is the reason you're able to see it all.
1738000	1740000	So you're seeing light, right?
1740000	1742000	And you're also seeing with light.
1742000	1752000	So you are the light, seeing the light, seeing the flowers, the flowers are sensing the light, reflecting off you.
1752000	1754000	They don't have to have eyes.
1754000	1757000	They have cellular hyperstructures.
1757000	1758000	So do the trees.
1758000	1759000	The flowers are probably fast.
1759000	1760000	The trees are a little slower.
1760000	1768000	Everything senses everything in light and electromagnetism and so forth.
1768000	1775000	Some materialists will argue, well, the effects are so tiny.
1775000	1779000	I know, but the problem is that when things get really tiny, they get really weird.
1779000	1786000	So let's keep both things in mind and not just say, well, the effects are vanishingly small.
1786000	1796000	Vanishingly small turns out to be, whoops, superpositions, whoops, black holes or whatever.
1796000	1811000	Anyway, so you have this problem of not going nuts or of going nuts and then trying to sort of tune the three or four different dials you need to tune to produce coherent feedback, right?
1811000	1820000	From that recursive interaction at the membrane of the interface, at the boundary of the interface, whatever you think of as the interface, right?
1820000	1844000	Whether it's your physical vision or the surface of your skin or the electromagnetic boundaries put out by the fields your body produces as a complex cellular hyperstructure, however minute those fields might seem to our measuring machines.
1844000	1856000	So guess what? There's a feature of consciousness like the doctor or the philosopher, which isn't merely the psychologist, though the psychologist is probably involved if we're doing this well.
1856000	1876000	Perhaps the counselor and the therapist and the priest and the seer woman and the saint and the witch and so forth, they are in us and they can face ourselves from within us, right?
1876000	1884000	They are in us, all those things because it's not just what you've seen portrayed in your life, though that may have colored what's in you.
1884000	1912000	It's what you brought to human birth in the lineage of your particular 873,421 ancestors and nurture what you grew, the context you grew up in and nature herself, the library that's beyond your ancestors that you draw your being from, this world and so forth.
1912000	1941000	This world would produce all of the different modes of awareness that we humans know of and speak of in our catalog of madman, author, philosopher, child, father, mother, grandmother, grandfather, hunter, warrior, athlete, dramatist, poet, actress, singer, musician, magician, wizard, witch, shaman.
1942000	1951000	Scientist, naturalist, psychologist, mathematician, engineer, all of these things, the world naturally produces all of these things.
1951000	1960000	So all of these things, the world is more than them.
1960000	1976000	The world is the hyperstasis of these modes, right? All these modes are in us.
1976000	2000000	Few of us will experience the broad array of them, and probably many of us at least, we will have an experience of some we don't like, the patient, the injured one, the victim, the target, scapegoat.
2006000	2026000	The rejected one, the criminal, the bad person, the outcast, the insane person, the broken person, all these things.
2026000	2033000	We will have some experience of that array and it will change in different times in our lives.
2033000	2039000	Hopefully we don't just get stuck in one or two, especially if they're very dark.
2064000	2073000	So it's funny, the people next to me are talking about a very similar topic.
2073000	2095000	The dog is simultaneously trying to get at the geese and sneezing, which is its body trying to interrupt it being triggered by the geese.
2096000	2103000	It's having two very strong conflicting triggers at the same time.
2103000	2111000	One sort of more psycho-emotional but very physical, eat the goose, chase the goose, get the goose.
2111000	2119000	And the other one, don't kill the animal, don't run away from the human, don't need to kill the animal.
2119000	2123000	Or something, who knows what's in there, but it's making it sneeze.
2123000	2128000	And dogs often sneeze to interrupt triggers.
2128000	2133000	Or so I've heard.
2133000	2145000	So of all the kinds of modes that we can have, inside us there's one that oversees the coherence of the entire system.
2145000	2155000	And that one's job is to determine if we've gone batshit crazy or if we're having actual trustworthy, non-ordinary experience.
2155000	2165000	Because most forms of crazy resemble or feel like non-ordinary experience and it's hard not to trust them because it's our experience.
2165000	2181000	So we use the thing we see with, we see because of the thing we see with, the thing we see with casts a sort of a light on our experience.
2181000	2184000	And that light is interpretive.
2184000	2192000	And when it's coherent, non-ordinary sensing, very natural to human beings.
2192000	2202000	When it's incoherent, or there's a lot of stress, or there's a lot of pain, or there's an overarching narrative.
2202000	2212000	Or one is being negatively evaluated by others, which is a stress, of course.
2212000	2216000	Then the coherence breaks down.
2216000	2218000	There's all kinds of things that can break the coherence down.
2218000	2220000	Sometimes a coherence never forms.
2220000	2225000	And sometimes we can sort of adjust the dials.
2225000	2235000	Imagine you have something a bit like an equalizer on a stereo or a piece of musical gear or recording device.
2235000	2239000	You've got an equalizer, let's say, who knows what, 12 bands or something.
2239000	2241000	We could say six for ease.
2241000	2247000	Most of them have three, treble, mid, and bass.
2247000	2264000	So you could equalize the forces of flow in awareness, in the mind, in the inner eye with which you interpret.
2264000	2273000	With which you are both facing yourself and facing the world, and with which the world is facing you.
2273000	2280000	It's not an accident that one of the most commonly produced images...
2280000	2282000	Well, that's not true.
2282000	2291000	A very commonly produced image and a trope of schizophrenia, which is probably an outdated term at this point,
2291000	2300000	and far too broad to effectively discuss states of awareness, is simply a single eye looking.
2300000	2305000	A picture of a single eye, they draw this commonly.
2305000	2307000	And all of us do.
2307000	2309000	I mean, many of us have.
2309000	2320000	I certainly have drawn when I was little, just a single eye, in the middle of a pyramid or triangle or whatever.
2320000	2327000	We even have some structure resembling that on our money, I think, at least the one dollar bill, maybe.
2327000	2333000	Yeah, this is a thing to be observed from without, evaluatively observed,
2333000	2346000	or observed from without by a disembodied thing, like a machine, or a robot, or a camera, or Facebook, or Google, or Sears, whatever.
2346000	2364000	Whatever corporation is interested in getting inside your little identity structure and dragging some loyalty out of you, momentary or long term.
2364000	2369000	It really is as if we're in a sea of demons trying to get us to worship them.
2369000	2375000	And money is one of the substitutes for worship.
2375000	2379000	Money is the worship commodity.
2379000	2394000	Anyway, my point is just that there's a feature of the mind that looks at consciousness's structure, features, activity, results, and decides, am I okay or not?
2394000	2399000	Am I still in my, quote, right mind, unquote?
2399000	2411000	And now we've looped back, and we're going to start producing feedback against the first topic, which is, okay.
2411000	2417000	When you look out at the world, it's a wave hitting a wave.
2417000	2427000	It's the world as a wave, the world is waving, it's making light, bodies, animals, humans, food, all these things, right?
2427000	2430000	And you are the world, and you're looking back at the world.
2430000	2435000	So where those two things intersect, there's going to be feedback, that roiling wave phenomenon.
2435000	2439000	And you're going to have the same thing happen if you look at consciousness with consciousness.
2439000	2454000	It's going to produce feedback, just like an electric guitar is, you know, when you take the pickups and put them near the speaker, it's going to start squealing.
2454000	2463000	Unless, you know, there's mechanisms to stop it or whatever.
2463000	2475000	When humans who've long been separated first are reunited and they have, they hold each other in a steam and are happy, you'll hear them laughing and raising their voices in the tone of their voices.
2475000	2477000	Feedback, right?
2477000	2481000	When they're departing just as those people were, same thing, bye!
2481000	2485000	Raise your voice, wave your hands, it's feedback, it's a wave.
2485000	2488000	Literally wave your hands, I mean.
2488000	2493000	So when you look at consciousness with consciousness, it's going to produce feedback.
2493000	2502000	Now you really have a problem because you're trying to determine, you've got one aspect of consciousness, the sort of overseer in a way.
2502000	2509000	Not in the bad sense, the one who checks to see if you're okay, mainly.
2509000	2528000	So you've got this overseer dude or chick or whatever, looking at the flow of consciousness and remarking on it, analyzing it, testing it, checking it.
2528000	2534000	Well, that's going to produce feedback right away, you're going to have a lot of trouble with that.
2534000	2538000	Now most of the time it works fairly well because its job isn't too tough.
2538000	2546000	With ordinary consciousness, it's not too hard to do a state check and come away with a green light, right?
2546000	2562000	But once you start having non-ordinary experiences of consciousness, unless you have practice and you know something about a strange way in which awareness and consciousness resemble a kind of a living water.
2562000	2566000	If you know something about that, you've got a better shot.
2566000	2573000	If you don't, what will happen is the shapes in the waves, the shapes in the feedback will overwhelm you.
2573000	2587000	You will identify with them, you'll take them seriously, you'll take them literally, you'll take them hyper-connectively or synchromistically, and that's when you're going to get into trouble.
2587000	2592000	Now, there are kind of...
2603000	2616000	There's a sort of a pareidolia, right, which is the inclination to see figures in flowing, changing shapes like the grain in wood or the bark on a tree
2617000	2632000	color differentials in quartz, the inclusions in quartz, those things form the suggestions of shapes.
2632000	2640000	And when consciousness examines consciousness and produces feedback, it's like this, right, it does this.
2640000	2654000	And, you know, that interaction, if a deco here is just a little bit, will slip toward paranoia or megalomania or both.
2654000	2664000	And some other, you know, mania, paranoia, megalomania, hyper-creativity.
2671000	2682000	There are many different modes of madness, and there's a whole range of this kind of phenomenon, consciousness, that isn't bad or malignant.
2682000	2686000	It won't get you killed. I've seen it in a number of people.
2686000	2704000	They're in a sort of what we might think of as a manic state, but there's authentic, something resembling authentic prophetic awareness.
2704000	2708000	And this is a huge problem because you can have both things going on.
2708000	2720000	You can have the person is in the grip of a series of narratives, and they're having authentic prophetic awareness at the same time.
2720000	2726000	They have escaped the prison, outside the prison world of ordinary mind.
2726000	2735000	They're not merely batshit crazy, and they're learning, they're sort of like a bird on its first flight.
2736000	2746000	They're learning how to see with the seven other eyes of the self and the soul.
2746000	2752000	And it doesn't have to be seven, I'm just using that like nine, thirteen, whatever you like.
2752000	2755000	The many other eyes of the soul.
2755000	2762000	And normally what happens among the ordinary humans is the ordinary humans just shut up now.
2762000	2766000	They don't know how to relate with that at all.
2766000	2771000	They have no protocols for that, so they just shut them down.
2771000	2789000	This usually ends in hospitalization, drugging, self harm, accident, all kinds of things.
2792000	2808000	So we want, most of us, we want some degree of non-ordinary.
2808000	2812000	We want to get a little bit out of the prison and we don't want to go insane.
2813000	2819000	Well if you're going to go to, right, if you're a person who's lived in the desert your entire life
2819000	2823000	and you decide like, I really want to go swim in the ocean.
2823000	2832000	You don't just go jump, you know, from an airplane into the open sea.
2832000	2838000	You talk, you learn about the ocean, you learn about the water, you learn about currents
2838000	2848000	and how to solve various problems that will certainly arise when you encounter the actual ocean.
2848000	2855000	That will throw you around, sink you, trap you, drown you, eat you.
2855000	2860000	You learn about these things, right, and it's the same with consciousness.
2860000	2866000	Over time you will naturally, as long as you don't go completely nuts
2866000	2871000	or burn your mind with either drugs or trauma, or both,
2871000	2882000	those things can burn patterns into the flow that are not helpful and can be leafily terrible.
2882000	2890000	You can sort of crack the membrane in such a way that the crack tends to persist over time
2891000	2897000	with drugs, with trauma.
2897000	2908000	Sometimes just with probably DNA, heredity, maybe, nature and nurture, toxins are also trauma.
2909000	2919000	So, it's dangerous terrain and...
2919000	2941000	So, you know, it's not the kind of thing where you want to just go messing about with it.
2941000	2945000	And this is mostly what happens with young people and with older people.
2946000	2955000	They mess about rather unskillfully using drugs and adventurism and so forth.
2955000	2958000	Huge problem.
2958000	2969000	Dreaming is the near-at-hand doorway to probably everything you can hope for in terms of getting outside the prison.
2969000	2989000	It's a natural deprisming process, right, and it's a living process that happens to most of us with great regularity.
2989000	3001000	It's rich. It decolapses the mode of identity and consciousness.
3001000	3004000	It's very profound.
3004000	3012000	And that is another self-facing aspect of awareness, right, the dreaming aspect.
3012000	3015000	It doesn't face the world.
3015000	3017000	Well, maybe it does in a way.
3017000	3034000	Maybe it mirrors the world rather than facing it with itself facing inwardly.
3034000	3041000	But we can achieve something not dissimilar in what we think of as ordinary consciousness as well.
3041000	3049000	And to some degree, by talking of these matters, by considering them unconscious in our awareness,
3049000	3062000	we are already beginning to step just a little bit outside the prison of ordinary thought without going all the way to madness, you see.
3062000	3083000	And talking about some of the dangers that we may encounter when we depart the extremely stultifying predictability,
3083000	3102000	normalcy of our habitual state of mind.
3102000	3126000	I'm playing the violin.
3126000	3137000	If we move from one of the specific modes of self-facing awareness, consciousness, intention, purpose, one of the forms.
3137000	3149000	Even if we move away from, if I move away from the daring form just toward the human or the organism or the being or the planet or the sky tree,
3149000	3172000	if I move away, then the field becomes rich, very rich inside it with ways of seeing that aren't trapped like my mind often is.
3172000	3200000	It's when I am shrunk down to daring and I'm worried about my worries and identity seems concrete, explicit, given by circumstances, structured, compelling, continuous.
3200000	3209000	Patrick McGowan's old TV series, highly experimental, called The Prisoner.
3209000	3212000	It's hilarious.
3212000	3217000	This old TV series, it's kind of about this problem.
3217000	3224000	It's the problem of folding consciousness or awareness back upon its origins.
3224000	3228000	And look, this is what physicists do.
3228000	3229000	This is what philosophers do.
3229000	3231000	This is what children do.
3231000	3233000	Mothers are doing this.
3233000	3235000	The sky is doing this.
3235000	3237000	The world is doing this.
3237000	3239000	This is the dooming of all things.
3239000	3241000	They're doing this.
3241000	3246000	They're being this process.
3246000	3267000	Well, we can get trapped in a backwater, so to speak, of the labyrinth of feedback that results from recursion in the between of consciousness and being.
3267000	3282000	And if we direct consciousness at itself, which is effectively what we usually mean when we say the words meditation is kind of what we mean.
3282000	3290000	We mean to become observant of kind of the surface of the water of the mind from above it.
3290000	3303000	And long observation of that will give us the skills, naturally, to not lose our way if we should suddenly find ourselves outside the prison.
3303000	3308000	Or if the prison should start to dissolve, so to speak.
3308000	3310000	We won't panic.
3310000	3314000	We'll remember, ah, yes, this is just the dissolution of the walls.
3314000	3316000	It's always interesting.
3316000	3322000	It's very commonly like this.
3322000	3338000	These features are familiar from what I've experienced in just observing my own mind and how it transforms from a modal thing to its potential state.
3338000	3346000	A state of potential, and even the potential can half fade into origin.
3346000	3348000	And some will say, why are you saying half?
3348000	3352000	And I'll say, because I said half.
3352000	3360000	Yes, you have origin, potential, and just tiny little bubbles of structure on the surface that can fade away.
3360000	3363000	Now, identity is gone.
3363000	3367000	Now, perhaps, no more symbols either.
3367000	3374000	Enlightenment, the living light in awareness of its own origin and nature.
3374000	3381000	But to get there, you know, I've not got there.
3381000	3388000	I've walked in that direction, some.
3388000	3406000	So I've learned a little tiny bit about the water and the eddies and the currents and the character of the situation.
3406000	3409000	We are born to see outside the prison.
3409000	3427000	We start from outside the prison, and we walk into it and build it up on purpose as we are instructed to do by our peers, parents, culture, history, language,
3427000	3435000	thrifts of various kinds, isms.
3435000	3442000	And then, because we are so familiar with it, we get married to it.
3442000	3448000	We get stuck in it.
3448000	3455000	The spider's web is supposed to extend its sensorium and world line.
3455000	3459000	If our minds were like this, they would.
3459000	3461000	They do, naturally.
3461000	3475000	But our minds can become a trap in that we get stuck on features of the web that we've made and we confuse those features of ourselves.
3475000	3484000	Our identity or our situation and so forth.
3484000	3487000	I am home. I will rest.
3487000	3490000	Thank you for joining me.
3490000	3495000	I wish you a very beautiful way and day and dreams.
3495000	3498000	See you.
3498000	3504000	I look forward to learning together again, sometime soon.
3504000	3507000	Bye-bye for now.
