00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
Hello everybody. Welcome. So part of how I learn, I'm sorry to say, is by being intellectually

00:24.000 --> 00:34.440
impetuous, precocious, and naive. And what that usually turns out to mean, or what that

00:34.440 --> 00:45.440
commonly often turns out to mean, is that I'm going to make bold mistakes in my first

00:45.440 --> 01:00.120
essays of an idea that will sort of fertilize the garden of my mind if I'm lucky. If I'm

01:00.120 --> 01:11.480
unlucky, those bold mistakes become doctrine, dogma, or my pet theory. And that happens too.

01:12.200 --> 01:25.120
This is part of the danger of trying to chase insight alone, right? So that I don't have to

01:25.120 --> 01:39.520
fight anyone powerful who's got an objection or a contrary perspective. This is part of why

01:39.520 --> 01:51.240
I've been willing to put up with my scientist friend Kevin for 15 years or something, 20 years,

01:51.240 --> 02:01.360
because he only fights me. He nearly never agrees with anything I've thought, believed,

02:01.360 --> 02:15.600
perceived, and so forth. And he's very adept in the intellectual confines of argument or debate.

02:15.600 --> 02:39.080
I wonder if we'll hear some coyotes because of the siren. Sorry about that devastating

02:40.080 --> 02:53.880
oral attack. I suppose I could edit it out, but it seems useful. I'm seeing something really

02:53.880 --> 03:03.280
interesting here. Okay, so there's a there's a three pronged pine needle floating in midair,

03:04.120 --> 03:17.080
and moving around on the breeze. And the closest branch it could be connected to is probably a

03:17.080 --> 03:29.760
minimum of 15 feet away. And the branch it's probably connected to is 20, 25 feet away. Oh shit.

03:29.760 --> 03:38.520
Oh yeah, there it is. Wow. Okay, so oh, huh. All right, this is even weirder than I thought.

03:38.520 --> 03:53.120
Because the branch it actually appears to be connected to is not above it. That's funny.

03:53.120 --> 03:59.360
Maybe a friend just flew right past my face to wake me up to the fact that it's here.

03:59.360 --> 04:11.840
All right, so what's actually going on isn't what is apparent. And this is the problem with ideas.

04:12.160 --> 04:22.640
It certainly looked, I'm gonna have to test this, which is sort of frightening because I don't want

04:22.640 --> 04:31.400
to change. I want to understand something about the situation without modifying the situation.

04:31.840 --> 04:42.120
And this is the problem with knowledge and perspective is that often it is impossible to

04:42.120 --> 04:48.120
determine what is the case without so severely disturbing the case quote unquote,

04:48.120 --> 05:02.160
that we cannot, our first moves wrong foot us for all future moves. So I'm trying to understand

05:02.160 --> 05:11.240
this what I'm looking at, which is a triad of dry pine needles floating apparently floating in the

05:11.280 --> 05:21.720
atmosphere. And what I'm trying to understand is, and it seems very unlikely that this is the case,

05:21.720 --> 05:36.560
but it is possible. Because spiders are crazy, amazing in their abilities to forge what I call

05:36.720 --> 05:44.560
anchor strands for webs. And that's what this is is a spider kite. It's an anchor strand kite.

05:45.920 --> 05:54.000
So a spider at some point in very recent history has attached a web.

05:54.440 --> 06:06.040
And originally, I thought the web that was attached was from the kite up.

06:06.040 --> 06:19.080
But I can see that there's a web from the kite sideways. What I can't tell is if there are two

06:19.240 --> 06:30.400
webs, because the kite is behaving as if there are two. And I don't really want to disturb it.

06:31.360 --> 06:40.240
But I'm going to try to determine the movement of the kite

06:45.040 --> 06:46.880
is so counterintuitive.

06:47.880 --> 07:09.120
I can't understand what is lofting the kite. If the only web is to the side,

07:09.360 --> 07:26.800
because when the wind is reduced, the kite should fall. And it does fall some, but not enough.

07:29.200 --> 07:34.480
And so it appears when I'm looking at it just doesn't seem possible, but it is.

07:35.360 --> 07:48.080
I don't think there's a second strand attached above it. But the way the kite is flying,

07:48.080 --> 07:53.200
it appears that there would have to be two strands. I don't think there is. I tried to test it.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.800
Again, the problem with something this delicate, well, first of all,

07:59.760 --> 08:10.240
it might be safer to test than I thought, because it's most likely that the web strand

08:13.200 --> 08:21.120
is not sticky. Ah, okay, I've just figured it out. There are two strands. One is invisible.

08:21.920 --> 08:30.720
Okay, that makes sense. Now the behavior of the kite makes sense. I cannot see the second strand,

08:30.720 --> 08:36.080
but I could interfere with it. Wow. So now,

08:40.080 --> 08:47.200
now I really don't understand how the object was formed, because I can understand the spider

08:47.920 --> 08:55.840
attaching. Ah, there's the second strand. I can see it now. But from the opposite angle,

08:55.840 --> 09:00.240
I can see it. Okay, and both of them go to the side. But what I can't understand,

09:00.240 --> 09:07.760
what seems impossible to me, is how the spider got this kite in the middle of what appears to be

09:08.320 --> 09:18.400
two strands. Yeah, no idea. It just seems impossible. I can imagine the spider attaching the kite,

09:20.480 --> 09:29.360
you know, dumping the strand from a high branch. I have no idea how the kite could be in the middle

09:29.440 --> 09:39.760
of two strands. No idea. I'm going to take a picture of this just for kicks, so I'm going to,

09:39.760 --> 09:54.960
oh wait, I can take a picture without stopping the recording.

10:00.080 --> 10:08.560
Huh, effectively invisible in the photograph.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.960
Very blurry in that one.

10:14.960 --> 10:29.120
A little, yeah, useless. All right.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.480
Forgive my throat clearing.

10:34.800 --> 10:45.680
Yeah, it seems impossible. I'm looking at it. I'm sure there was a method that produced this

10:47.920 --> 10:49.760
seemingly absurd impossibility.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.680
And I've seen stuff like this before. Spider kites are amazing.

10:55.920 --> 11:04.400
And if you actually look at large webs, particularly those of orb weavers,

11:06.480 --> 11:10.160
and it turns out that this topic is covalent

11:14.320 --> 11:22.240
to the topic I'm going to stumble into with great impetuous ignorance in a little bit,

11:26.080 --> 11:34.320
um, if you look at the large webs, particularly of orb weavers,

11:36.240 --> 11:38.320
and you actually try to understand,

11:42.960 --> 11:45.360
it's not too hard to understand how the web is constructed

11:46.800 --> 11:55.200
once the anchor strands are in place. But if you try to understand how the anchor strands were forged,

11:56.560 --> 12:07.520
whoo, good luck. You're going to have to see it happen or, you know, have an entomologist.

12:09.520 --> 12:14.960
I don't know if there are arachnologists, there probably are, study arachnids.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.720
But yeah, you're going to have to have someone explain it to you.

12:18.800 --> 12:25.920
And until you actually see it happen, if you carefully think about the web and you look at it,

12:26.640 --> 12:31.440
it's going to look impossible to produce many of the anchor strands,

12:31.440 --> 12:36.880
and especially to connect them at tension in the center of the web.

12:37.360 --> 12:43.520
And this turns out to be

12:48.960 --> 12:56.000
correlated with the topic that I intend to pursue here, as soon as I manage to effectively

12:56.000 --> 12:58.240
clear my throat, which I will not do in your ear.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.560
Let's see. Okay.

13:11.120 --> 13:11.360
So,

13:18.240 --> 13:22.000
I think before I even get to the topic, I'm going to talk about the web some more.

13:26.480 --> 13:32.080
The world line of an organism

13:35.200 --> 13:43.920
can be imagined as the size, shape, spacetime tunnel

13:46.400 --> 13:50.080
that an organism traverses during its lifetime.

13:50.640 --> 14:00.960
Now, it should be obvious that the world lines of other similar organisms

14:03.440 --> 14:09.360
are productive of the world line of a single organism, i.e., a human baby has two parents,

14:10.240 --> 14:11.520
two immediate parents.

14:11.600 --> 14:21.920
It's unclear. There's a problem with trying to compute the number of progenitors of a human,

14:23.120 --> 14:28.320
because there's a problem where, and even the common answers to the problem don't actually

14:28.320 --> 14:32.560
solve the problem. As far as I understand it, I'd love to be corrected about that,

14:33.920 --> 14:38.480
because this is something that has bothered me for a long time. It looks like,

14:39.440 --> 14:47.760
as you go backward in time with two ancestors, you know, my dad had two ancestors,

14:48.640 --> 14:54.400
my mom had two ancestors, so that's four. They each had two ancestors, so that's eight.

14:55.520 --> 15:01.200
Sixteen, et cetera. You have the chessboard problem of one grain of sand on each, you know,

15:01.600 --> 15:15.200
N plus one grains of rice on each. Is that it? Is it N plus one? No, you double the grains of rice,

15:15.200 --> 15:31.440
so it's N to the X, N to the 1, 2, 3, 4 powers as you traverse the chessboard.

15:32.400 --> 15:44.240
Long time ago some, it is claimed. Some astute mathematician was offered a reward by a king or

15:44.320 --> 15:53.440
queen for having solved the problem, and they requested one grain of rice on the first square

15:53.440 --> 16:01.840
of a chessboard, two on the next, four on the next, and so forth. At first glance, this looks

16:01.840 --> 16:12.080
like a paltry sum, but if you understand the nature of powers, you realize that on the final

16:12.080 --> 16:18.800
square you'll have, I don't know, more of grains of rice than there are on earth or something,

16:18.800 --> 16:31.200
a ridiculously large amount of grain of rice. So organisms have a world line, and for the purposes

16:31.200 --> 16:38.000
of our discussion, and I may even be misunderstanding the world line, because I often do misunderstand

16:38.800 --> 16:44.640
complex principles from science, not having had to mathematically validate them myself.

16:47.200 --> 16:52.400
So I can have a naive understanding of things, and it's not uncommon for me to do so.

16:54.080 --> 16:59.760
It is uncommon for me to notice in real time that my understanding is or is likely naive,

17:00.160 --> 17:13.360
but, okay, where am I going here? So imagine

17:16.400 --> 17:25.360
that an ovum in my mother's womb has a world line, and it is the size and shape of an ovum,

17:25.600 --> 17:31.200
and it is traveling inside my mother's womb, so it's tracing. Imagine that we light it up and we

17:31.200 --> 17:39.840
make a tracer backward and forward in time. It appears sometime during or after her embryo

17:39.840 --> 17:47.440
genesis, probably after, I would guess. There's a light, and it's the size of an ovum,

17:47.440 --> 17:56.800
and it makes a tunnel as it travels through time, and then eventually it meets another light,

17:56.800 --> 18:02.080
the size of a sperm, which has been doing some traveling in my father's testicles,

18:03.680 --> 18:10.960
and it meets these two lights that make a tunneled shape, a tunnel of their shape

18:11.600 --> 18:18.320
in time space, right? So wherever my mom goes on the surface of the earth, that changes the tunnel's

18:19.120 --> 18:25.200
trajectories. The earth is spinning, so that changes the trajectories. The earth is orbiting

18:25.200 --> 18:31.920
the sun, so we're going to follow it inside my dad's body on the surface of the earth,

18:31.920 --> 18:37.280
around the surface of the earth's spin, around the earth's orbit of the sun, and then around the sun's

18:37.920 --> 18:42.320
orbit in the galaxy, and then around the galaxy's orbit, orbits, or movements in the universe,

18:44.240 --> 18:52.400
and you'll get exactly one tunnel, sperm size shaped, and ovum size shaped, and then these two

18:52.400 --> 19:02.400
meet, and my world line begins there. So at first I am the size of an ovum with an embedded sperm head

19:02.400 --> 19:14.160
in it, and then it becomes a multicellular blastocyst, and so forth, and becomes Darren.

19:14.800 --> 19:20.880
So first I'm baby-shaped, and my world line is baby-shaped and sized, and then as I get older,

19:20.880 --> 19:25.200
it gets bigger and more complex, more numbers of cells, and actually each of those cells has a

19:25.200 --> 19:31.280
world line, each of the bacteria in me, each of the viruses, so I'm kind of a galaxy of world lines

19:32.160 --> 19:41.360
if we're taking my components. Okay, so why am I saying all this? Because the spider is insanely

19:41.360 --> 19:56.960
brilliant. What the spider does with its own body, with no, no, with no artificial technology,

19:57.840 --> 20:06.800
the spider extends its world line so that in time space the world line of the spider is always

20:06.800 --> 20:20.880
extended by any web it is presently occupying or connected to, and that means that the world line

20:20.880 --> 20:31.680
the world line of a spider has a secondary element, the web, and the web is literally

20:33.280 --> 20:41.280
at least where the web is not. Spiders do all kinds of things with webs, they don't just make

20:43.280 --> 20:49.040
they don't just make the webs the capture webs, they also make various kinds of travel webs,

20:49.440 --> 20:59.920
and they probably make and discard webs as they're attempting to forge a capture web.

21:07.760 --> 21:12.640
All right, so

21:19.920 --> 21:26.560
the world line of a spider

21:34.480 --> 21:37.600
has two components at minimum,

21:42.000 --> 21:46.960
the spider and the web. Now notice that what the web does is it literally filters time space

21:47.920 --> 21:50.800
to capture the world lines of other insects

21:55.120 --> 21:56.400
which it then consumes.

22:01.360 --> 22:05.920
It probably doesn't consume all of the insects that intersect with its web,

22:07.040 --> 22:13.520
but the spider has two world lines, the spider-shaped one extended by the web-shaped one.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.440
And that's pretty astonishing.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.680
Okay, so here comes the more complicated thing.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.520
The spider web

22:38.320 --> 22:46.320
is an object with an organismal origin.

22:54.800 --> 22:59.040
There's no chance you will encounter one

22:59.760 --> 23:07.120
that has neither an organismal origin nor a mechanical origin.

23:08.480 --> 23:13.040
And a mechanical origin in the way that I'm going to use this word

23:14.880 --> 23:22.720
has an organismal origin because it means something built robots to build spider webs.

23:29.440 --> 23:32.880
Now I differ with many scientists,

23:40.800 --> 23:42.160
particularly Lex Fridman,

23:46.400 --> 23:46.880
in that

23:54.000 --> 23:58.080
I have a limited definition of the word machine.

23:59.040 --> 24:13.120
And because I haven't had to refine it in careful argument, it's probably fairly clumsy.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.360
But it goes something like

24:20.720 --> 24:26.160
a non-organic tool or device forged by humans.

24:29.760 --> 24:41.280
Many scientists, particularly physicists and neuroscientists,

24:42.640 --> 24:46.640
I think they're making a monumental category error

24:49.280 --> 24:50.160
when they claim

24:53.600 --> 24:58.560
that organisms and biologies are machines, that neurons are machines.

25:00.000 --> 25:06.000
Now I understand something of how they come to that,

25:07.840 --> 25:15.680
but the humans have a problem in which we transfer, we, devastatingly ignorantly,

25:17.360 --> 25:22.480
we transfer metaphors from technology back onto organisms.

25:23.360 --> 25:32.560
Thus we say, for example, your heart is a pump, your lungs are bellows.

25:33.920 --> 25:38.160
Both of these things are impossible, formally impossible.

25:38.160 --> 25:41.200
You will not have ideas without your heart, right?

25:41.200 --> 25:45.360
There will be no arguments, no science, no religion, no nothing.

25:46.640 --> 25:51.360
There is no pump that produces such effects in time space.

25:52.560 --> 25:59.360
There is no pump that causes ideas, although

26:04.080 --> 26:10.960
large language models, some might argue, I think we're getting close, Darren, with LLMs.

26:14.720 --> 26:17.840
But LLMs are built by humans, right?

26:17.840 --> 26:28.240
So the humans exist in the causal chain of origination necessary to LLMs.

26:29.760 --> 26:34.160
So LLMs don't just arise out of the nature of time space, you have to have,

26:34.960 --> 26:37.920
apparently, you have to have humans on earth so far as we know.

26:38.880 --> 26:42.080
All right, so

26:46.640 --> 26:56.640
when I imagine organisms, when I think of organisms, I think of

26:57.440 --> 27:10.320
unimaginable complexity, single cell, to simulate it properly at, say, the level of the atom,

27:11.680 --> 27:17.440
to fully simulate it, would require much more than all the computation humans have ever done,

27:18.320 --> 27:27.520
would require something like 400 million years of the fastest computer we have pinned

27:28.400 --> 27:34.400
at its top operating capacity. The Fugaku, I think, is the name of that computer.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.240
And again, I'd like to be corrected if I've got this wrong.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.600
I think accurately simulating the, oh, by the way, that's accurately simulating

27:45.680 --> 27:54.960
the activity of a cell over one second. Okay, so you're talking about

27:57.600 --> 28:03.360
truly monumental in actions of intelligence and physical complexity.

28:08.160 --> 28:12.480
And as we attempt to understand how best to simulate a cell,

28:13.440 --> 28:18.720
our knowledge of the cell's complexity is increasing very rapidly. So

28:20.800 --> 28:22.640
the thing that's increasing more rapidly

28:27.600 --> 28:32.800
is the complexity we're facing, not our capacity to simulate it.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.920
So when I think of organisms,

28:43.440 --> 28:52.080
I think of living beings, we could call them systems, but I prefer to call them relationships,

28:58.080 --> 29:03.680
or relational hyperstructures or biorelational hyperstructures. And by hyperstructures, I mean

29:04.960 --> 29:11.200
a multi-dimensional structure that entangles and complexifies temporalities,

29:11.200 --> 29:14.640
not just one temporality, webs of temporality.

29:20.080 --> 29:25.600
So that is nothing like a machine. In fact, that might, if we were going to attempt to

29:25.600 --> 29:33.760
define the opposite of a machine, organisms and minds would be likely candidates because

29:34.080 --> 29:43.360
organisms, so far as we understand them, contribute to and sustain negentropic

29:44.400 --> 29:53.040
relationships on the surface of living planets, whereas machines dump death into that system

29:53.040 --> 30:00.800
in the form of entropy. So machines offload entropy into living systems, living systems

30:01.680 --> 30:09.600
levitate, in a sense. If entropy is gravity, organisms are,

30:13.200 --> 30:15.520
can be imagined as anti-gravity.

30:18.800 --> 30:26.800
They do something that should be impossible, or that seems impossible at first glance,

30:26.800 --> 30:31.360
and maybe there are biologists who can explain this in such a way as to satisfy

30:32.320 --> 30:36.560
my troubled mind about this matter. Then correct me.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.880
I haven't seen evidence of negentropy in machines,

30:48.000 --> 30:53.920
and on any planet where those begin to show up, where you have an organism complex enough to

30:53.920 --> 31:02.640
produce mechanical objects. It looks to me like, unless that organism is vastly more intelligent

31:02.640 --> 31:08.880
than humans, in terms of knowing what not to do with technology, you will get a dead world there

31:08.880 --> 31:13.680
right quick, geologically speaking, a few thousand years at most.

31:14.480 --> 31:27.600
So, unlike Lex Fridman and his ilk, who I respect and admire, and I want his voice at the table,

31:27.600 --> 31:33.760
I just don't agree, and I love his podcasts. In fact, the reason I'm making this recording

31:33.760 --> 31:40.640
is due to one of them. It's due to his podcast with Lee Cronin and Sarah Walker.

31:44.640 --> 31:48.480
Who are producing theoretical children if they have not produced physical children.

31:51.520 --> 31:54.960
I can't tell if they're a couple or not, and I haven't done the research to figure it out,

31:55.520 --> 32:00.800
but listening to them part of me is just like, oh please let these two humans

32:00.800 --> 32:06.400
mate and produce offspring. I've rarely felt that, though I did feel it with

32:06.400 --> 32:14.080
Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner. They would have produced an offspring capable of just laying

32:14.080 --> 32:19.920
waste to human consciousness with humor. It would have been like the atomic bomb of comedians.

32:26.560 --> 32:33.680
So, Lex seems to think that if you get a complex enough machine, it's alive,

32:33.680 --> 32:43.760
and if you build a robot, that's your baby. Thus, he projects his own essence into his

32:43.760 --> 32:53.520
mechanical creations in a way that he defines as lifelike enough to qualify as life.

32:54.160 --> 33:02.640
I think this is a ridiculous misapprehension of the nature of organisms, but again,

33:04.160 --> 33:12.800
I'm excited. I would love to sit down and talk about this with him. Never happen. I'm a nobody.

33:12.800 --> 33:30.000
Lex is famous. All right, so let me explain partly why I don't think machines

33:31.760 --> 33:39.760
have the same mode of world line that organisms have.

33:42.800 --> 33:52.320
It is that they cannot inherit or participate in directly the world line complexity of origination,

33:53.120 --> 34:06.560
relation, heredity, and lineage that the simplest organism has more of than all the numbers you

34:06.560 --> 34:14.720
could ever make. The simplest organism has an infinite historical relational web

34:17.440 --> 34:26.160
of trillions of endless amounts of numbers of transformations and relationships per

34:26.160 --> 34:29.680
instant, whatever interval you want, billionth of a second.

34:33.760 --> 34:46.080
And so, in a sense, the organism's historical body is transcendentally vast and intimate,

34:46.560 --> 34:59.040
and the transactions that the organism, that that body has participated in,

35:03.760 --> 35:10.000
are monumentally vast and supportive generally of nearly all other organisms.

35:16.240 --> 35:33.200
Machines, on the other hand, by existing end the world lines of organisms.

35:35.440 --> 35:41.520
Many, many organisms must die to support the existence of any machine, at least around here.

35:41.520 --> 35:47.120
And so machines look like, to me,

35:51.120 --> 35:58.560
a sort of deadly plague for organisms, generally speaking. They look like the opposite of life.

35:58.560 --> 36:04.960
They put an end to organismal lineages. Any automobile is a perfect example of this

36:05.760 --> 36:10.640
that will kill nearly everything it touches, and many things it never touches. In the past,

36:11.280 --> 36:18.240
and in the future. How does it kill things in the past by ending the lineages of living beings

36:18.240 --> 36:25.520
today? That, effectively, can be understood to travel back in time and destroy the entire lineage

36:27.360 --> 36:33.040
of relationships that produce and exist as, say, a duck run over by a car.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.120
All right, so where am I going here?

36:46.560 --> 36:56.560
Now, Lex seems to believe that what I will call simulacra are

36:56.960 --> 37:15.680
as vital, as potent, as alive as organisms, particularly as we approach the churning limit

37:17.440 --> 37:22.480
of our incapacity to distinguish them.

37:22.880 --> 37:33.040
So, if I simulate a philodendron, and you can't tell the difference between that philodendron

37:33.840 --> 37:39.680
and an actual philodendron, a living one, it inherits the property alive.

37:39.840 --> 37:53.280
This is the argument for touring tests in artificial cognitive systems,

37:55.120 --> 38:01.760
and I never bought it. I'm sure that Lex could table some very fierce objections to my objections.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.320
I don't know what they are yet.

38:04.960 --> 38:15.680
It has never seemed to me that if you can't tell the difference, they're the same thing. Sure,

38:15.680 --> 38:21.680
they're the same thing in terms of the lexical category we are likely to use to refer to them,

38:22.800 --> 38:32.960
and yes, if I'm looking at the plants I am walking past, and 87% of them are simulations,

38:32.960 --> 38:40.240
and I am unaware of that, then they will seem to me to be plants, but if I discover,

38:42.480 --> 38:44.080
okay, then it comes down to

38:47.760 --> 38:53.280
is there any way to determine the distinction? Is there any way to notice the distinction,

38:53.920 --> 38:59.040
to experimentally observe the distinction between a simulation and an organism?

39:00.000 --> 39:08.240
And I will argue that I don't believe it's possible to produce simulations as complex as organisms

39:09.280 --> 39:15.040
at all. There may be exceptions to this, and I'm open to changing my mind.

39:17.680 --> 39:25.120
But to me, and one of the things I like about the topic that I'm going to start to blather on about

39:25.120 --> 39:35.440
here is that it looks like we may have found a way to measure,

39:38.720 --> 39:51.760
to reliably determine the developmental complexity of anything we may observe or interact with.

39:55.440 --> 40:05.440
And this is an incredible thing. Now, it may turn out, this is early days for this theory,

40:06.400 --> 40:12.320
it may turn out that the theory is falsifiable, or it may turn out that the theory becomes falsified,

40:12.320 --> 40:20.960
is what I meant. It's incredibly bold, but of course, like any good scientist,

40:21.040 --> 40:26.480
Lee Cronin and his teams, and Sarah Walker, and so forth,

40:29.200 --> 40:33.760
who I imagine to be among the parents of assembly theory,

40:38.720 --> 40:41.760
like any good scientist, if they're wrong,

40:42.560 --> 40:51.840
and the theory is formally falsified somehow, we'll get smarter. So,

40:52.560 --> 40:56.720
build the boat, float the boat, if it sinks, okay, we'll make better boats thereafter,

40:57.520 --> 41:00.160
because of what we learned from this one that sank. But

41:04.080 --> 41:08.960
the arguments and data, as I understand, the arguments and the arrangement,

41:09.440 --> 41:16.880
arrangements of data that comprise assembly theory presently look

41:18.160 --> 41:25.920
provocatively convincing. And this is where I'm going to get into trouble, and being naive and stupid,

41:29.440 --> 41:35.760
because I've only just, I've only accidentally stumbled onto this topic

41:36.400 --> 41:43.600
over the past few weeks. I've listened to a couple of long interviews with Lee Cronin.

41:45.040 --> 41:53.200
I'm not mathematically sophisticated enough to understand it the way a scientist understands it.

41:53.200 --> 42:00.720
I believe their paper on this theory

42:04.000 --> 42:12.240
was published against all odds, right? I think it was published in nature.

42:12.480 --> 42:24.160
And I heard the story of its publication, and I work in that field. I work in the field of

42:25.920 --> 42:32.800
editing biomedical manuscripts for publication in what are referred to as high impact journals,

42:32.800 --> 42:48.080
such as Nature Cell, so forth. So, let me see if I can encapsulate, meaningfully,

42:49.040 --> 43:05.760
what I imagine to be the core positions of assembly theory is something like this.

43:05.760 --> 43:22.960
Instead of proposing a new physics, assembly theory originating,

43:23.920 --> 43:38.080
Lee Cronin, I believe is a chemist, assembly theory posits a new definition of objects.

43:40.400 --> 43:48.480
And so, instead of positing that point particles, electrons, photons, etc., are fundamental,

43:48.640 --> 43:54.960
it posits that objects are fundamental and provides a definition of objects.

43:54.960 --> 43:58.000
By the way, I'm not reading this. I should be.

44:00.800 --> 44:11.440
It provides a definition of objects based on their, on decomposing them and determining

44:11.920 --> 44:20.960
the index of complexity required to produce the objects.

44:25.920 --> 44:33.680
And this produces models such as causal graphs

44:34.560 --> 44:43.680
that are empirical measurements of

44:46.640 --> 44:53.760
historically, of timelines, of world lines, of objects,

44:54.720 --> 44:58.400
that are determinative

45:02.480 --> 45:09.040
and produce a metric for the complexity of any given object, say a molecule,

45:12.160 --> 45:17.520
or an organism, or a machine.

45:18.400 --> 45:25.200
And this discovery is absolutely mind-blowing.

45:30.240 --> 45:39.120
The number of technologies and ways of knowing that are likely to emerge

45:39.360 --> 45:50.720
quickly, if this theory is further validated, obviously it's fairly well validated to appear in nature,

45:57.520 --> 45:58.720
are staggering.

46:01.840 --> 46:06.640
But the thing that I find particularly surprising about it is that it will give us

46:09.440 --> 46:22.080
an empirical measure of various features of organisms

46:23.680 --> 46:30.240
that I argue it will give me a way to prove that machines can't participate.

46:31.200 --> 46:35.200
In

46:43.200 --> 46:43.840
how to put it.

46:46.800 --> 46:54.080
It is as if there is a living water inside the organisms that is made of their origin

46:54.080 --> 47:00.880
and lineage relationships that is carried forward in time and comprises a dimension of its own.

47:02.160 --> 47:08.080
Not only do machines not participate in that specific dimension, they tend to tear it apart

47:08.800 --> 47:14.800
and replace it with something that's dead inside, in my view.

47:15.040 --> 47:21.280
And, you know, am I an ideologue about this?

47:22.560 --> 47:23.120
Partly.

47:24.720 --> 47:31.760
I certainly want to learn and be convinced otherwise, if

47:37.200 --> 47:42.800
if that's the direction toward greater insight and intelligence.

47:43.760 --> 47:45.760
I fiercely doubt it.

47:46.800 --> 47:50.160
I am a biofile, not a technophile.

47:52.800 --> 47:58.320
If you wanted to rip the entire history of life on earth to shreds,

47:58.880 --> 48:00.960
all you have to do is give humans machines.

48:01.840 --> 48:04.960
They don't have societies intelligent enough to survive that.

48:05.680 --> 48:07.200
I would liken it to

48:12.720 --> 48:23.760
finding a, okay this is a very abstract analogy, but imagine I have a two and a half year old male infant.

48:26.720 --> 48:28.880
I abuse it in a variety of ways.

48:30.480 --> 48:33.840
This is no, not suggesting we abuse infants here,

48:33.920 --> 48:38.800
but I've used the infant in a variety of ways that make it very angry.

48:38.800 --> 48:42.400
Stop feeding it, give it no attention, yell at it, whatever.

48:44.640 --> 48:47.840
And then once it's thoroughly spun up,

48:51.920 --> 49:01.280
I give it a thermos with no lid, and the thermos contains, I don't know,

49:02.240 --> 49:08.160
molten steel, but it's so well insulated you can't tell it's hot on the outside.

49:08.800 --> 49:12.240
And then I just give the infant the thermos and leave.

49:13.920 --> 49:17.280
What is going to happen is going to be really bad for that infant.

49:18.400 --> 49:25.840
And similarly, giving humans any kind of technology, this goes to my argument that

49:26.800 --> 49:31.360
actually ethical scientists would nearly never publish.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.400
Well that's not going to help the worm.

49:41.600 --> 49:44.000
I'm not sure what to do about that poor creature.

49:44.400 --> 49:55.600
Yeah, actually ethical scientists would nearly never publish because

49:58.160 --> 50:04.400
there are no intelligent systems of humans competitive enough

50:05.120 --> 50:11.760
to prevail against the lethally oriented organizations of humans

50:12.640 --> 50:21.680
that will certainly end life on earth or, at the very least, produce an extinction event

50:22.800 --> 50:28.080
of staggering scope. Some will argue, yes, extinction events are good.

50:29.120 --> 50:36.640
By extinguishing vast rays of organisms previously, we ourselves arose.

50:36.640 --> 50:42.800
Okay, great, but I'm actually concerned about the agently conserved ecologies.

50:42.800 --> 50:43.840
Those things are rare.

50:46.400 --> 50:54.080
And there's also a timeline. Just like a human being, a planet has a lifespan,

50:55.040 --> 51:01.360
and as it gets nearer to the probable end of its lifespan,

51:02.320 --> 51:06.560
the sudden effusive generation of new forms becomes less likely,

51:07.280 --> 51:11.120
and the ability to sustain those forms over time becomes less likely.

51:13.440 --> 51:20.960
In a sense, it looks to me like the earth is bio-evolutionarily old enough

51:21.920 --> 51:27.760
that it has cancer, and the cancer on the earth is the appearance of machines.

51:28.560 --> 51:35.920
Right, these are tumors. They are highly structured modes of time-space artificially

51:35.920 --> 51:41.040
produced that kill everything so that they can be sustained and reproduced.

51:41.760 --> 51:45.680
There's something similar in human cognition that I call thrips.

51:47.600 --> 51:51.840
So I would argue that human cognition has become elderly in the sense that

51:52.800 --> 51:54.320
it's no longer producing.

52:01.360 --> 52:10.480
It produces far more artifacted structure than it does useful intelligent novelty

52:10.480 --> 52:11.840
and relational novelty.

52:12.000 --> 52:23.280
Now, assembly theory gives us a variety of metrics and perspectives

52:26.480 --> 52:31.440
that would allow us to determine, and by the way, Cronin himself says,

52:32.720 --> 52:36.080
I certainly am suffering from the hammer-nail problem.

52:37.040 --> 52:39.040
Got a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.760
Vis-a-vis assembly theory.

52:44.640 --> 52:54.400
And naturally so, because I've never seen a model that could give us the ability

52:55.120 --> 53:10.800
to empirically determine so many, like literally to observe that, which was previously unobservable.

53:12.400 --> 53:17.680
It's almost like assembly theory is a kind of a cognitive lamp that sheds light

53:18.160 --> 53:25.840
on features of the universe that we have previously understood to exist,

53:27.360 --> 53:32.880
but had no way to formalize. That's incredible.

53:36.880 --> 53:47.120
So I'm going to try to make a future recording about this in which I am vastly more capable

53:48.160 --> 53:52.400
of reiterating some of the root concepts

53:56.240 --> 54:00.400
associated with assembly theory. And I have to say that

54:04.480 --> 54:12.880
I've been a, what, a scientophile. I've loved science since childhood because

54:13.840 --> 54:16.800
it looked like one of the ways of knowing

54:19.680 --> 54:25.360
that the humans propagate that is relatively likely to produce

54:26.640 --> 54:31.840
intelligent understanding, behavior, societies, and so forth. Turns out, not the case.

54:35.040 --> 54:40.960
At least not in my lifetime. Turns out, science is the way of knowing most likely to produce

54:41.520 --> 54:49.200
absolute devastation on earth. And by absolute, I mean the capacity to snuff the biosphere,

54:49.760 --> 54:55.200
shut it off like a fucking light switch. And everyone says, oh, there's no way to do that.

54:55.200 --> 55:05.680
They're wrong. I could show them five ways to do it now. Once you have a certain array of technologies,

55:11.200 --> 55:19.120
you will have the capacity to combine them in relatively accessible to single humans or

55:19.120 --> 55:22.720
small group ways. This is what Daniel Schmockenberger is on about with,

55:25.520 --> 55:33.840
let's call it, multi-polar threats. He's got some other nomenclature that's also very useful,

55:33.840 --> 55:44.480
race to the bottom. So yeah, life on, you know, the earth is very similar to a cell

55:45.920 --> 55:55.040
in certain respects. And its robust resilience is absolutely dependent on

55:55.760 --> 56:06.160
the continuation of the organs that produce the possibility of homeostasis

56:07.520 --> 56:14.080
in the atmosphere and environment. Much like a cell, if you lies the membrane,

56:15.120 --> 56:20.560
you penetrate the membrane of the cell in the right kind of way, the membrane collapses,

56:21.520 --> 56:28.320
that planet will die. You'll end up with something not dissimilar to Mars. Now, some will argue that

56:32.480 --> 56:35.600
the continuous existence of liquid water on the surface

56:37.360 --> 56:47.760
is sufficient to guarantee the continuance of organismal complexification on earth.

56:48.320 --> 56:48.960
Could be right.

56:53.120 --> 57:00.240
But for myself, I'm bonded with the anciently conserved ecologies in my heart, mind, and spirit.

57:01.360 --> 57:04.880
Science turns out to be the way of knowing that will allow humans to dispose of those,

57:06.480 --> 57:15.440
and in a sense causes them to dispose of them by continuously producing new technologies

57:18.720 --> 57:22.560
that, in factively,

57:29.760 --> 57:38.640
in other words, the continuously penetrate new dimensions of the organs of the biosphere

57:39.760 --> 57:41.440
and offload entropy into them.

57:42.000 --> 57:49.280
This doesn't mean I'm anti-science.

57:54.160 --> 57:57.760
Science is one of the most reliable ways of knowing that we have.

58:01.760 --> 58:06.960
However, science is also heavily compromised

58:07.120 --> 58:14.640
by malignant imperatives

58:18.080 --> 58:29.200
that propagate like a kind of mold in human culture.

58:30.160 --> 58:34.080
And then those imperatives capture ways of knowing

58:36.320 --> 58:39.600
and weaponize them for the sake of profit, power, or

58:42.640 --> 58:53.840
decimation, obliterating things, crushing the opponent zero-sum games.

58:53.920 --> 59:03.600
So science is still half noble, or a tenth noble,

59:06.320 --> 59:13.600
but most of what science will actually produce is likely to further human

59:14.720 --> 59:21.440
technological development, which looks to me lethal to both humans and the history and future

59:21.440 --> 59:25.840
of life on earth. And whether or not it completely obliterates life on earth

59:27.120 --> 59:35.760
sort of doesn't matter, right? If I murder your entire family and one of your children

59:36.480 --> 59:38.160
manages somehow to survive,

59:38.960 --> 59:53.920
this doesn't validate my murder or the murder of the entire family.

59:53.920 --> 59:56.880
I guess there was some Russian royal family that was essentially

59:59.840 --> 01:00:04.240
captured up, taken somewhere and just executed. I can't remember who the Romanovs may be.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:12.160
And the fact that some janitor

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:23.840
survived in no way reduces the atrocity index of the slaughter of the family

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:29.040
and their children and everybody. And I think it's funny that we, it's natural,

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:35.280
but it's also peculiar that we pretend that, well, it's relatively okay to kill the adults.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.840
They, they had some life, just don't kill the children and keep some women around.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:46.640
That's in, you know, that kind of moral relativism doesn't fly well with me. I think all of the

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:56.320
beings, all of the adults, arch still children too. There's very few, if any,

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:12.240
statuses that ameliorate the moral or ethical imperatives that orbit do not kill

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:17.840
and especially do not murder, do not slaughter.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
So back to assembly theory.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:37.360
So there are two particular forms of data that, and by the way, I deeply encourage you to listen

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:47.600
to Lee Cronin describing the origins and publication of the assembly theory paper.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.280
I may be able to produce a link in the description later.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:02:02.560
But the two primary forms of data that emerge that I, that I understand to some degree at this point

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:12.560
are what's called the assembly index, which is a measure of the necessary extant complexity

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:22.560
required for an object to become possible in the universe. Now that, by the way, Cronin says that

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:34.560
time turns out to be fundamental to anything relating to analyzing objects. And I agree with him

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:42.560
that at least through the lens of assembly theory and a number of lenses familiar and preferable to me,

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:48.560
time is something far different from tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:03:04.160
In fact, organisms and their relationships create modes of time. I refer to these as

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:10.480
temporal hyper, biorelational hyper structures or biotemporal hyper structures. And when idiots,

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:21.440
or when people make idiotic statements, and I've heard both Neil deGrasse Tyson

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:30.960
and Sabine Hossenfelder, I'm not sure if I got her last name right,

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.040
make bold and idiotic claims such as,

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:48.640
there's no reason for aliens to travel, you know, millions of light years, thousands of light years

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:58.080
to visit the earth because humans are boring. That is the epitome,

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:08.320
hi, nice to see you. That is the epitome of egoic anthropocentric stupidity,

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:12.480
in my view. And maybe they're stirring the pot, right? Maybe they're trying to,

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:19.040
they're just trying to produce trigger bait. But the earth

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:30.800
is a vast library of biorelational hyper structures. These must be incredibly rare

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:46.960
in time space by volume, even if they are common in number, right? Even if there are billions

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:55.760
of living worlds as complex as ours, as stable as ours, stable enough to produce hands,

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:02.640
eyes, wings, tentacles, minds, so forth, embodied minds.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:14.960
Those things are not merely interesting. They are producing modes of time space that if you,

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:22.480
it's like looking for diamonds or looking for gold, right? Walk all over the place,

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:28.720
you'll find nearly no gold. In the entire history of me walking around on the earth,

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:37.760
the only diamonds I've seen are on women's fingers, generally, or men's. Or unfortunately,

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:43.200
in the latter part of my life, inside people's teeth, come on people. Are you guys nuts?

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:55.760
Apparently. So yeah, living worlds produce forms of biotemporal complexity

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:04.160
that are unimaginably uncommon in time space, even if there are lots of them. And each one of them

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:14.800
will have incredibly unique features. So for shame, Tyson, you are acting the public idiot here

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:24.880
in an anthropocentric and egoic way that is truly embarrassing, not just to you, but to the idea

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:33.440
that you're a scientist. And similarly, Sabine, what the hell are you thinking? You think the humans

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:39.920
are the only reason to visit earth? I mean, as a human, are you only interested in the humans?

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:47.920
The fuck are you thinking? And again, maybe these people are just trying to produce trigger bait.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.960
They certainly succeeded in my case. Because honestly,

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.600
if I was capable of publicly slapping them in the face for such a comment,

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:05.840
I might be willing to descend to that.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:17.680
Yeah, I find that just ridiculous. And it does stir me up if I'm willing to be stirred up that way.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:24.640
So the two concepts in assembly theory are the assembly index of an object,

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:38.400
which is an empirical measure of, it's like a graph, I guess, or there's actually a second concept,

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:46.240
which is the causal graph. And I think I sort of understand the assembly index

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:59.440
as a measure of the complexity necessary in the temporal historical context of the universe

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:15.680
to produce for an object to be constructed somehow. And then the causal graph is a bit more obscure

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.920
Let me see if I can find the definition for that.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:26.480
I suppose the causal graph is a way of encoding

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:41.360
propositions about the paths of origination of an object. Now again, assembly theory is very new.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:49.280
A lot of scientists are quite upset about its existence.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:05.200
I mean, there's a vast population of haters already for this theory, because it,

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:12.240
in some senses, if properly validated,

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:25.600
it might comprise a super science, something that steals the foundations

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:33.600
from many other branches of research. It just captures those foundations.

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:42.240
And it's very early days. There remains a great deal of work to do.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.840
However, one problem with

01:09:54.800 --> 01:10:02.240
sir, your dog, it's having trouble. It has, yeah, there you go.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.480
Yeah, it was just walking funny because it was trying to

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:24.000
So whether or not assembly theory is validated, it's already producing

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.800
uncommonly useful results.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.720
And in listening to cronin,

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:51.040
I've spent some time listening to intelligent humans, and particularly intelligent males.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:58.080
I guess just because the media puts more of them in front of me, generally speaking.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:10.560
However, Sarah Walker is a wonderful example of an absolutely brilliant intellectual female.

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:17.920
I'm not even sure if I'm allowed to use explicit gender terms in 2024.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:24.240
I may, I may end up canceled or beheaded for having done so.

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:35.120
But yeah, Lee is one of the most intelligent minds I've ever had the pleasure of listening to.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:39.200
This doesn't mean that I agree with everything he says or believes.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:44.160
And in fact, one of the reasons I find him intelligent is you will very commonly hear him say,

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:51.040
I've just changed my mind about this. This is something I've nearly never heard out of the

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:59.920
mouths of anyone. And even in the interview with Lex Fridman, where he and Sarah Walker,

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:03.360
you know, the interview is ostensibly about aliens. There's, I don't know,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.640
like eight minutes of talk about aliens in the interview, and it's four hours long,

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:19.120
which is awesome. As most of you know, I'm down with long form. Let's do it long form, you know.

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:26.480
Let's have the foreplay for hours, and then, you know, all the other stuff, and then the meal,

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:33.760
and then the bath, and then, you know, the dreaming, and then, yeah, everything. Let's have it all.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:42.800
Of course, I'm not getting any of that stuff. That's all pure fantasy at this,

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:51.520
in my present circumstances. And has long been that way. Maybe that's why I'm,

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.360
maybe that's why I have changed my perspective. But my point was just that,

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:06.480
yeah, I can see if you can give Lee an argument that allows him to visualize, particularly

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:14.480
to visualize experiments that can be done to determine, qualitatively, quantitatively,

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:27.600
empirically, ideologically, the validity of an argument, or the power of an argument,

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:34.800
the conclusiveness of an argument. He will immediately change his mind if he can see

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:42.080
and understand the structure. And I've rarely seen this quality. I'm not sure I have it.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:53.120
I am very, I'm very likely to be committed to my pet theories. And I encounter so few

01:13:54.240 --> 01:14:05.760
intelligent people to explore with that it's uncommon for me to

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:16.400
be presented with something I find.

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:38.400
Wow, coughing child, death knell. The child will probably survive.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.960
But who else will?

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:54.640
Yeah, I just don't, I don't encounter anyone intelligent enough, or motivated to push against

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:04.400
commonly. There are, there are a few such people in my circle.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.400
Hmm.

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:24.720
The most profound tree that I know is in this little part of the garden.

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.920
I'm going to pause for a moment. I hope I will return.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:48.640
So I've noticed that some one, I can't recall the guy's name, just saw it briefly,

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:59.760
has published an essay on medium called The Eight Fallacies of Assembly Theory.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:03.840
Definitely people are going to be highly motivated to attack this thing,

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:09.360
which is probably good. I mean, I think Cronin himself and Sarah Walker would,

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:20.320
and they have other associates, Sharma at all. You can see their team on the primary paper.

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:37.600
So the thing is going to undergo a radical evolutionary process by furious objection.

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:43.920
People are going to be very highly motivated to attack this thing, primarily because

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:52.880
if it turns out to be valid or useful, which it seems extremely likely

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.920
to be profoundly useful in the sense that

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:10.240
it gives us ways to detect the existence of stuff that we've never been able to see before, like

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.760
it's not merely a new language.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:29.520
It's a new method of considering the nature of identity, what things are.

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:37.920
And this is incredibly provocative and profound.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:51.920
I mean, literally my mind is so blown by what I've heard from Cronin

01:17:51.920 --> 01:18:02.320
that I mean, one analogy would be

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:10.720
if

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:22.720
so in some ways, as someone who has reason to suspect that I've had

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:33.040
long-term contact over some interval of my life with a non-human intelligence of extremely exotic

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:39.840
and profound nature and ability. It's not just similar to someone who says,

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:52.080
you know, not only did one day out in the field at night, my family and I encountered

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.160
what appeared to us to be a vehicle from time space.

01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:06.000
But they took me with them in

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:17.440
their vehicle and they taught me some of their ways of knowing

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:23.360
right over many months and showed me

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:34.400
how they perceive the universe, organisms, time space, all these things. So in a sense,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.120
compared to the minds of common others around me,

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:53.120
my mind is a bit like a UFO landing in their backyard

01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:00.800
because I'm attempting to convey some of the things that I, some of the perspectives and

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:07.040
orientations that I have acquired over my lifetime, but particularly during my contact

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:12.880
experience. And there's lots of different ways to conceive of that experience other than

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:18.160
the contact with a non-human intelligence, though I would argue that most of what's

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:24.240
going on is precisely that because nature is a non-human intelligence of unimaginable sophistication.

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:32.640
You know, a library of such intelligences that upscale form a unity. And by the way,

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:36.320
it looks like a assembly theory might allow,

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.760
might endow the possibility of proving empirically

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:56.080
that the earth and the biosphere comprise a unity, an accessible to humans' unity.

01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:06.240
And many other things that are important, philosophically, ethically, morally,

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:15.520
and intellectually to me, perhaps even spiritually. I will admit that I associate my

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:21.280
biofilia, my adoration of living beings and their relationships and origins,

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:28.320
that does feel to me like a spiritual faculty,

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:41.120
or an expression of my soul, of the nature of my soul, which I imagine is a much more

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:48.560
complex entity than is commonly supposed. Yeah, that thing's got a lot of different

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:54.320
features depending on how and why we may be referring to it in language or making models

01:21:54.320 --> 01:22:02.640
in language concepts and so on. I'm going to pause for a bit because I'm coming to a place

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:11.520
of a lot of noise. With luck, I will return shortly. So I hope in the future to be able to produce

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.800
a concise

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.440
description of assembly theory

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:29.280
and its primary propositions.

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:41.280
But it looks like we may get a grasp on an entirely new form of knowledge

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:58.240
with the power to produce otherwise impossible insights about a broad array of features of

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:06.720
biology and particularly some of the most confusing problems

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.400
in science is concerned with origin of life.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:24.720
I have recently been listening to some debates on this topic and they are profoundly contentious

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.040
primarily because

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.120
the common models

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:38.720
in play in biology are ridiculous

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:46.160
and avoid nearly all of the fundamental questions necessary

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.240
to produce reasonable scientific arguments.

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:58.080
So assembly theory may give us

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:13.040
both a foundation for reasonable arguments and a path to evaluate them in the laboratory.

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:13.760
Right?

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:24.720
Cronin has a variety of radical and I think trustworthy ideas

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:33.040
about what we might do

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:37.280
to

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:48.160
produce both the precursors and perhaps actual life in the lab.

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:58.560
Again for my view, Lee if he's correct and his team and Sarah and her team

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:06.880
or their teams are giving the humans again something very likely to produce

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.920
incredibly lethal technologies.

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:16.000
Scientists often

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.440
inhabit the role of the villain in Frederick Brown's story The Weapon

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:36.480
in which a journalist comes to visit a scientist who is about to give the humans

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:48.320
something similarly deadly to nuclear weapons. The journalist argues against this.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:59.520
The scientist just says, you know, it's not my job to determine whether or not something

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:05.520
should be done. My job is to do what can be done. I can do this. I'm going to do it.

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:15.120
It turns out that the scientist has a developmentally

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:23.840
inhibited child.

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.840
I'm not sure what the right nomenclature for that is these days.

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:42.400
A child who is 12 that has the mental age of that might be associated with a three-year-old

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:48.320
and the journalist manages to give the child a loaded gun

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:57.360
surreptitiously which the scientist later finds him with in his bed.

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:11.600
It's a powerful refutation of the argument. We should do what we can. Whatever can be done

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:13.680
should be done.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:22.320
No, absolutely it should not be done. There are all kinds of things we can't do that we must

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:30.240
never do. In fact, it turns out that much of what is productive and

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:40.720
supportive and crucial to what I mean when I use the word intelligence,

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:51.200
much of that is prohibitive. It's what must not be done for it to continue to be possible

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.920
for us to be intelligent

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:04.320
or to exist at all. Obviously, if you're not existing, you can't be intelligent anymore.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:17.680
I hope to return with a more educated perspective on assembly theory, but I want to encourage my

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:31.840
listeners to explore it because honestly, it looks like a discovery with the potential

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:41.840
to have more impact than relativity did or at least a discovery of a similar degree of impact.

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:53.600
If it isn't defeated, it will change the face of science as far as I can see

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:56.560
from my current understandings of it.

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:07.120
So for example, there's a degree of demonstrable complexity in a system

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:24.800
that is demonstrative of the activity, interference, or origination by an intelligent being or system.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:28.640
In a sense,

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:36.800
here we might find proof of God, but we might also be able to just look

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:53.120
at nearly anything in the universe and look, God is in quotes. I think it's my perspective that

01:29:53.680 --> 01:30:03.200
time space itself is, while not being fundamental, something productive of time space,

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:14.240
it is the result of a transcendent,

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:25.360
a layered array of transcendences in nature, in existence.

01:30:44.240 --> 01:31:02.240
So assembly theory may give us the ability to empirically determine

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:10.720
whether it is possible

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:19.760
for most of what exists or any specific element

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:36.320
to have originated without the interference or creative engagement

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:41.200
of some intelligence or transcendence.

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:48.400
Now I may be misunderstanding that, but from what I can tell from what I heard,

01:31:49.360 --> 01:32:01.280
there's a specific sort of cutoff point in the assembly index or the causal graph of an object

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:08.400
that is determinate, empirically determinate of whether or not it could

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:15.760
have come into existence without being purposefully or

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:32.720
or purposefully or tangentially resulting from purposeful activity.

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:40.880
And there may be some overlap here with other ideas. For example,

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:50.720
Cronin sneers at Scheldrake's morphogenesis, and yet there seems to be some

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:59.840
conceptual overlap. It may be very minimal, but there seems to be some conceptual overlap

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:05.120
between assembly theory and Scheldrake's concepts to me.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:15.520
Because it may well turn out, for example, that in a given possibility space,

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:26.880
once you assemble the first salt crystal locally, it now becomes easy to, in Cronin's language,

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:38.720
teleport the properties to other objects. And that resembles the results of

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:41.040
Scheldrake's theory of morphogenesis.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:49.360
So there's much more to learn here. I'm going to be spending some time digesting

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:56.400
more about assembly theory, and I encourage those of you who are interested to explore it.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:01.840
It looks either it's going to get defeated completely, in which case it will produce no

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:08.720
useful results, which seems impossible to me, by the way, or it will get partially defeated in that

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:25.760
it is not, its scope will undergo radical limitation, or we have a new way of understanding

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:35.200
objects, identity, interactions, and historical development of such matters.

01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:42.160
And it looks pretty likely that that's what's actually going to happen so far. So

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:50.000
thank you all for joining me. I look forward to learning and growing and seeing better together.

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:56.000
Again, sometime in the very near future, may your ways and lives be beautiful,

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:05.040
blessed, insightful, playful, and joyful. Bye-bye for now.
