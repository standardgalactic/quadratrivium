0	14000	Hello, everybody, including the Stellar's Jay.
14000	25840	Welcome.
25840	31400	I was listening to Eric Weinstein.
31400	35240	And that is the way, the correct way to pronounce.
35240	39640	It's Stein, not Steen, in this case.
39640	41560	Just to help you remember in case you care too.
46400	52400	And what he was talking about was complicated to
52560	59560	synopsis.
59560	64680	One of the subtopics was the danger of artificial
64680	69360	intelligence, which is something I can and will
69360	73520	riff on at length sometime soon, but probably not
73520	74520	today, we'll see.
83400	92400	And as some of you know, I've been deeply and rather
92400	100400	urgently curious about a phenomenon.
100400	102400	Phenomenon?
108400	111400	I think it's the latter phenomenon.
113400	117400	We'll find out later.
117400	120400	Yeah, I've been deeply curious about something that
120400	125400	took place in my life around the end of 2018 and
125400	133400	involved a sudden transformation of my lived
133400	140400	experience as a human being that was quite
140400	147400	confusing.
147400	154400	And I'd be inclined to think that this is personal to
154400	155400	me.
155400	160400	I'm traversing the boundary of what I might think of as
160400	164400	a life phase or something has gone horribly wrong in my
164400	173400	body or my mind or both.
173400	181400	And of course, you know, it's relatively easy to
181400	185400	become suspicious of oneself in a broad variety of
185400	196400	exotic and often momentous ways.
196400	203400	It certainly didn't feel like this is local to me,
203400	205400	but then you always have the question, how would you
205400	212400	know?
212400	229400	To the degree that you're isolated or unable to...
229400	244400	You don't have access to a broad group of people with
244400	256400	whom you can explore quest, actually, together.
256400	261400	And I want to be really clear that if you're trying to
261400	271400	learn something, you want a tightly knit, brilliant,
271400	280400	curious, passionate, playful, creative little cohort of
280400	289400	three to eight people or something to do the work with
289400	298400	because in any situation where you share motivations as a
298400	304400	human being, and in case it isn't obvious, all of work.
304400	306400	That's not a small category.
306400	309400	The entirety of work.
309400	317400	And all of war, the entirety of war, both of these two
317400	323400	things primarily capture and, you know, weaponize in their
323400	334400	own ways, deploy both the intrinsic urge.
334400	337400	And I want you to hear the word urgency when I use that word
337400	341400	there.
341400	359400	The intrinsic urge to follow each other into something
359400	373400	like triumph, glory, if you will, beauty, profundity.
373400	385400	To follow each other into meaningful roles and noble and
385400	390400	triumphant endeavors together.
390400	402400	And if any of us take a moment and stop and ask ourselves,
402400	413400	does any of my human experience muchly look like that?
413400	416400	In a way, a lot of that is make something new happen.
416400	417400	Children are very good at it.
417400	419400	They just play.
419400	422400	Of course, dismissing it with such a simplistic word doesn't
422400	425400	help us understand what's really going on there.
425400	435400	It's nothing like the common supposition of meaningless
435400	438400	costumery and role-playing and so on.
438400	443400	Notice that much of what the children do qualifies as role-playing.
443400	446400	The adults are doing that but not realizing it, and they're
446400	451400	often playing roles that actually suck, that are terrible to
451400	458400	play for the sake of jobs and war and for the sake of the
458400	476400	anatomy rather than learning and so forth.
476400	486400	Eric said that one of his favorite quotes, which he said he
486400	493400	loves, and I know what it is to crafted a phrase that one feels
493400	498400	pretty excited to have participated in the birth of.
498400	503400	This is possible in language and it's possible in English.
503400	510400	Few of us have good reason to reach for it regularly.
510400	519400	Most of us have suffered losses and injustices that would
519400	528400	incline our hearts to rise from their common graveyards and
528400	543400	speak posthumously about what killed them.
543400	546400	That would be a heroic endeavor.
546400	551400	You certainly want a small cohort of human agreement.
551400	555400	The agreement to pursue, for example, what we refer to in
555400	559400	English as a course of action together.
559400	564400	For mutual benefit, insight, for justice not in the sake of
564400	570400	punishing something that went wrong but in the sense of doing
570400	575400	something so beautiful that everyone who ever lived would
575400	580400	obviously agree and stand up and cheer where they present.
580400	582400	That's what I mean by triumph.
582400	590400	I don't mean game theoretical zero sum-ness.
590400	593400	I beat him, whatever.
593400	595400	I don't mean that.
595400	601400	There's always an option more beautiful than any that's ever
601400	604400	been tabled.
604400	609400	In a sense, this is what we are going, this is what humans go
609400	614400	nuts over when they become very interested in.
614400	618400	Small sequences of time in a sporting event.
618400	622400	Notice those two things.
622400	625400	What is primarily meant by sport?
625400	632400	The actual underlying meaning is we will become heroic together
632400	637400	and there might be a subtext that goes something like,
637400	642400	while threatening but not actually killing each other.
642400	648400	While threatening to destroy the foe and even using similar
648400	649400	language.
649400	654400	He devised that, you know, right?
654400	660400	But largely if not completely avoiding explicit, you know,
660400	664400	lethal physical violence the way something like war does.
664400	669400	Obviously these two very confusing behaviors of humans have a
669400	673400	lot in common and discovering what they have in common and how
673400	678400	where that originates and how those forces could be redirected
678400	692400	would be the mandate, not the mandate, the, it's not purview.
692400	700400	It would be the description of, some of you will know the word I'm
700400	708400	trying to remember.
708400	711400	Somewhere between mandate and purview is this word and I think it
711400	724400	starts with P, the provision of a worthy mission, right?
724400	730400	A quest in which our triumph would liberate many beings.
730400	736400	And if there's a simple definition of the kinds of quests that I
736400	742400	think we come to human incarnation in order to participate in,
742400	746400	ignoring that language is fallible and confusing, we might say
746400	753400	something that resembles.
753400	758400	Let us return degrees of liberty, insight, communion and memory to
758400	765400	each other moment by moment while we dwell here in a very
765400	775400	confusing layered array of desynchronizing masquerades proposed
775400	782400	and in some cases mandated by something that is neither human nor
782400	784400	sane.
784400	789400	We will work against those things together to ensure a better life
789400	796400	for our children, a happier eternity for our ancestors and indeed
796400	800400	for all of the kinds of children and ancestors that the earth produces.
800400	802400	And maybe we could extend it beyond there.
802400	807400	No, all, all forms of ancestors, all forms of children in all of
807400	810400	time on every world, right?
810400	815400	As if they were one family, which I have good reason to strongly suspect
815400	830400	they probably are.
830400	839400	So Eric's one of his favorite quotes or something he said is,
839400	844400	and I may be paraphrasing slightly, but it's such a short statement
844400	856400	that whatever noise I'm likely to introduce will be very minimal.
856400	861400	It will probably preserve the spirit of the speaker rather than depart
861400	868400	into my own projections.
868400	879400	He said many people will die never having heard their own voice.
879400	896400	And he doesn't mean the kind of hearing that I am at present experiencing
896400	903400	in my ears of my speech.
903400	911400	He means something like,
911400	918400	what your soul itself would compose given the liberty and skill required
918400	921400	to do so.
921400	933400	In a moment of cataclysmic passion that not merely transforms history
933400	943400	but mediates it in such a way as to pierce the veils of both linguistic
943400	946400	and social fictions completely.
946400	955400	A shining sort of insight, a passion of meaningful form.
955400	968400	And the ironic thing is that Eric has succeeded in doing something that
968400	972400	it might be called a grunge in my private language.
972400	976400	It's a branching. It's a specific kind of branching.
976400	986400	There are statements that turn out to enact and at the same time describe
986400	999400	what they themselves are doing.
999400	1007400	And one of the things that Eric is doing there
1007400	1009400	isn't as dumb as speaking.
1009400	1012400	It's not as simple as speak truth to power.
1012400	1015400	It's interesting though that, you know, sometimes could be
1015400	1020400	if it hadn't been captured and weaponized against its own origin
1020400	1028400	by nefarious amalgams of zombie-like intention in the dead protocols humans run
1028400	1031400	and call civilization.
1031400	1037400	And maybe just there, I was doing what Eric was doing.
1037400	1047400	Raising a sword against an entire dimension of actual injustice
1047400	1053400	of immiserating humans and all beings on Earth
1053400	1056400	because if the humans aren't happy, boy,
1056400	1062400	will they visit the punishment to every possible place it can be visited
1062400	1070400	and invent new ones today.
1070400	1076400	He was doing what he was saying.
1076400	1079400	He was lifting his voice.
1079400	1082400	This is something that he obviously deeply believes in.
1082400	1087400	And I think he wants to do more than speak.
1087400	1097400	Even the opportunity, I doubt this guy would continue to sit on stages
1097400	1109400	expositing the trouble and his perplexity at what might be understood
1109400	1117400	as our mutual continued explicit toleration of and or active,
1117400	1123400	or I should say mostly passive, both, passive and active membership in.
1123400	1125400	This is what he would be very concerned about.
1125400	1130400	And I think most people, given an exit route from that charade,
1130400	1136400	they might be very cautious and frightened at first and timid.
1136400	1147400	But if they're given a modest taste
1147400	1151400	of the results of creative enactment, right,
1151400	1158400	creative mutual enactment of such principles,
1158400	1161400	they're not going to go back to McDonald's,
1161400	1168400	to the McDonald's of human purpose.
1168400	1177400	And one of the things Eric is saying is that something has gone horribly wrong.
1177400	1198400	And give me a moment here.
1198400	1203400	Something has gone horribly wrong in such a way
1203400	1208400	that it appears at least here in the West.
1208400	1216400	I can't, you know, and among many people known to me
1216400	1225400	that a fundamental resource that ordinarily causes our interest
1225400	1229400	and motivation and so forth has disappeared.
1229400	1236400	It has at least been occluded if it hasn't been straight up stolen.
1236400	1243400	Now, I don't know what happened at the end of 2018.
1243400	1246400	It's pre-COVID.
1246400	1250400	Having spoken with many people,
1250400	1259400	they describe a sudden onset of radical disturbances.
1259400	1275400	And some of them describe a felt sense of impending doom just before the transition.
1275400	1278400	I know that I'm going to say something that's kind of spooky,
1278400	1297400	but anything that can steal something from us that results in a significant loss
1297400	1308400	of the ability to detect the problem can just keep stealing till we're dead.
1308400	1315400	Anything that does that.
1315400	1327400	It should be obvious to the proportion of humans perversely incentivized
1327400	1335400	to go after the rest of the humans for whatever can be taken from them.
1335400	1340400	And let's be clear, that's a significant cohort in terms of power.
1340400	1343400	It doesn't have to have a big number.
1343400	1352400	Seven powerful people without agenda, they're going to make shit happen.
1352400	1356400	Here we see the dark side of the power of human agreement.
1356400	1364400	And that dark side is weirdly all around us.
1364400	1375400	It's very difficult to forge a vessel for discovery, insight, creativity, play, and triumph
1375400	1385400	in an environment where every organization can be captured.
1385400	1392400	Anything that succeeds can be captured.
1392400	1406400	So we might have to together become experts in the short term one stroke, two strokes,
1406400	1420400	successful quest or caper, mutual adventure, rescue, rehumanizing, liberating.
1420400	1430400	We might have to become really good at forming a pod like group, training it briefly,
1430400	1442400	running some experimental quests, and then going after something really worth achieving together
1442400	1446400	and dissolving and then going on to the next phase.
1447400	1452400	I've noticed that living systems in nature do this all the time.
1452400	1462400	They have extremely meaningful, however momentary,
1462400	1467400	semiotic or really pro...
1467400	1469400	Well, something I can't say in English.
1469400	1476400	It means pro-transsentient.
1476400	1484400	Endeavors where we don't just build a vehicle, we lift the whole context, you know,
1484400	1494400	two or three orders above where it normally sits.
1494400	1504400	And what I would suggest is that whatever the fuck happened in 2018 was the opposite.
1504400	1511400	Something drained a context.
1511400	1515400	And it may have only been partly human.
1515400	1533400	It may be that even the zombie functions that run as human civilizations and societies
1533400	1542400	obey some kind of a synchronizing influence, right?
1542400	1553400	Causing them to expand dramatically in concert with transformations of broader contexts
1553400	1557400	we have no language for or can't detect yet.
1563400	1581400	What Eric was saying was that
1581400	1594400	if you observe someone who is really straining at the edges of their capacity to act,
1594400	1598400	and this is something you will see in common between...
1598400	1602400	And by the way, there's ways to mimic this so you don't have to actually do it.
1602400	1611400	You can appear to be doing it and make shitloads of money and gain a lot of human attention.
1611400	1632400	But if our cultures, our nations,
1632400	1641400	our strange caricatures, like those assembled by an insane AI image generation system,
1641400	1652400	if they are strange caricatures of our actual or possible humanity, then war in a sense is them fucking.
1652400	1662400	And for the unfucked hallucinatory nightmare of not actually being human
1662400	1668400	thing that our nations have become, and maybe always were,
1668400	1673400	nothing, there's nothing more important than getting off that way.
1673400	1677400	This should be obvious if we just track where the money goes.
1677400	1679400	Where's the money?
1679400	1683400	It isn't in infrastructure. It's not in social development or education.
1683400	1685400	It isn't in healthcare.
1685400	1692400	The money is in generating disasters, which, you know,
1692400	1699400	this is why the zombie functions that run this way have as one of their organizing imperatives,
1700400	1709400	I'm using that word again, to fail.
1709400	1712400	Okay, we understand you're new here, Joe.
1712400	1714400	You've only been here a couple weeks.
1714400	1718400	We're trying to produce, you thought we were trying to produce a free energy device,
1718400	1723400	and so you've brought us seven designs that, as far as I can tell as an engineer,
1723400	1724400	probably produce free energy.
1724400	1726400	Don't ever do that again.
1726400	1730400	I'll let it go this time.
1730400	1733400	We're not here to produce solutions.
1733400	1735400	We are paid to study the problem.
1735400	1737400	That's what we do.
1737400	1739400	At great expense.
1739400	1742400	We get a lot of money.
1742400	1745400	Three million a month for a 25-person organization.
1745400	1750400	We get a lot of money to not solve that problem.
1750400	1752400	We'll let it slide this time, next time.
1752400	1755400	You're not only out, we'll come after you.
1755400	1760400	Don't go bringing stuff like this to anyone else, either.
1760400	1767400	This is the problem that we have with the prison military industrial complex,
1767400	1777400	that Eisenhower clearly saw clairvoyantly, but also not clairvoyantly.
1777400	1780400	He didn't have to imagine it in the future.
1780400	1789400	He was being faced with it during his presidency and was trying to do what Eric said, in a sense,
1789400	1797400	which is to hear the sound of his own actual voice above the din of compliance
1797400	1810400	and the nine kinds of compromised, cult-like, weaponized perspective
1810400	1824400	that feeds the paper mills of national invective and propaganda.
1824400	1830400	And that actually run the prisons, and that actually run the wars, and that actually eat the money, and so forth.
1830400	1834400	But they don't just eat money. They were satisfied to eat the money.
1834400	1841400	It might be worth paying them off just to keep them indolent.
1841400	1848400	Yeah, if that, that wouldn't be the worst investment I could think of of, I don't know,
1848400	1855400	$30 trillion over, what, 20 years or something? 15, who knows.
1855400	1861400	And that's just the money, right? Wherever you see money of that magnitude, you can be absolutely certain.
1861400	1871400	There's environmental, relational, cognitive, and metabolic obliteration, fields and layers of it all around where that money comes from
1871400	1885400	and what it gets used to do, and what it gets used to ensure we don't do together.
1885400	1893400	Yeah.
1893400	1899400	I'll be back in a moment.
1899400	1925400	So, what did the people who I've spoken with report directly to me and through others?
1925400	1944400	A sense of impending doom, almost a sense of impending doom, like Frank Herbert's science fiction, which I think both things would be right in a bizarre way.
1944400	1965400	A sudden feeling of relief, brief, right? Some of them described a brief feeling of relief as if something really heavy they'd been carrying had disappeared or been taken away.
1965400	1991400	And then a total lack of motivation, disruption of sleep, eating, sudden dimming of awareness and senses,
1991400	2008400	decreased desire for sex, but decreased desire for relationships,
2008400	2037400	near absolute a very strong avoidance of work, the loss of the desire to go to work in a dramatic and unprecedented degree.
2038400	2054400	Some of these things I felt myself, for most of the people I've talked to, it wasn't a temporary change.
2054400	2066400	It was what Mariners might describe as a sea change. The whole context is different from what it was yesterday.
2066400	2095400	And as Mariners will tell you, there's certain kinds of calm that, at least for ships long before motors, there's certain kinds of calm, certain flavors of it.
2097400	2101400	That portend disaster.
2105400	2119400	You know, one thing you will see as a theme in cultures older than our own, or even our own, not so long ago.
2120400	2136400	And you will see it both in, it's funny.
2136400	2151400	You'll see instances of this that have at least not terrible results, and you'll see other instances that are clearly tyrannical.
2152400	2165400	Let's not throw the whole idea away, because we've seen tyrannical implementations of ideas like the German phrase suggests Arbite-Mockfrey,
2169400	2176400	which in a relatively literal, simplistic translation is work makes free.
2177400	2193400	So, you tell everybody that you're bringing into a gulag that work will earn them freedom when, in actuality, what you have here is a death camp.
2194400	2219400	Nonetheless, humans need, and many tyrants have long been aware of this, humans need to feel useful and that they're contributing toward a meaningful communal identity and efficacy, triumph, glory.
2220400	2234400	And, you know, if no one gives them something better to do, then war and hatred will serve.
2234400	2247400	You can, when things are really bad, like they are right now, we're going through this period of an undeclared depression affecting millions of people worldwide.
2247400	2255400	If I know 50 of them, there must be millions, hundreds of millions of people who are like,
2255400	2260400	geez, you know, something that fucking went missing from my life.
2260400	2264400	Am I getting older? What's the problem? What's the cause?
2264400	2276400	And they must be doing, you know, 900 things to try to understand in their own way for those who were thus affected, which probably isn't everybody.
2277400	2282400	I mean, in fact, it's not like there's a strict cutoff date of 2018.
2282400	2292400	There are people who felt the loss far before then, and people who felt the loss sometime after then, and others who haven't felt it yet and may not.
2292400	2300400	Humans are sort of like a dish that you splash liquid on the counter toward the dish, right?
2300400	2311400	Let's say you splash beet juice toward the dish, and then what you'll see on the dish is lots of places are completely clean, nothing you can detect there.
2311400	2319400	There might be molecules, but nothing visible, and then other places are crimson red.
2319400	2327400	They're bloody in that sense of the metaphor that I'm weaving here.
2327400	2330400	That's how actual phenomena work.
2330400	2347400	The ones that affect everyone at once are, well, we would, you know, they have a quality that we would call,
2348400	2357400	okay, so the situation is someone has placed, someone has moved the dish, right?
2357400	2367400	And so the dish was on the counter previously.
2367400	2373400	Now we're going to place the dish onto a body of water surface,
2374400	2382400	and the dish will sink, and while it is sinking, let's say the dish is made of a mirror-like substance,
2382400	2390400	it will reflect the surface and what is beyond the surface. It will look like the sky.
2390400	2411400	So our cultures are a bit like zombies when they are not intentionally inhabited
2411400	2435400	by humans free, mostly free, of perverse incentives and the urge to mimic virtue rather than enact it.
2435400	2448400	Now obviously it may seem, and it perhaps often is, that in a state where you have to conserve some form of energy,
2448400	2458400	I don't mean electricity or gas, you have to conserve some form of energy that is primordial to human potential,
2458400	2471400	human awareness, human opportunity, human nature, human communal endeavor and recognition.
2471400	2479400	If you're going to have to operate in an environment where that fundamental energy has largely disappeared
2479400	2487400	for reasons that are not easily explained, I mean we might go looking for seers to help us understand this,
2487400	2499400	or possibly scientists, but they're pretty unlikely to be capable of the kinds of observations we need to get data about such things.
2499400	2519400	It doesn't mean obvious, right? Science is useful when it is useful, and there's lots of places where it is, regardless of how captured it's become.
2520400	2541400	So one of the things Eric was saying was that we appear here in the West
2541400	2555400	to have undergone a nearly complete evisceration of our collective motivation to enact virtue, to chase liberation together, to discover.
2555400	2565400	I mean he's particularly concerned about something I'm concerned about too, I just don't have the same feeling as he does perhaps.
2571400	2583400	He was using the analogy, which I think is a really good one, one of his hosts was saying, can we fix this?
2583400	2586400	Can we just do the right? Is there something we can do that's right?
2586400	2608400	And he was like, look, imagine that your wife is 8.X months pregnant, and suddenly, unexpectedly, because usually I think such things take us by surprise, her water breaks.
2608400	2613400	The question isn't, can we just keep the baby in there a little longer?
2613400	2630400	Even though that may become a question, the doctors may decide to do that from a broad array of confusions and intelligent sensitivities.
2630400	2637400	And he's using this analogy to describe humans on Earth.
2637400	2651400	What he is saying is, the water has broken, humans can't stay on Earth anymore.
2651400	2657400	The womb is turning, the humans are turning the womb toxic.
2657400	2662400	He's right about that. He's right.
2662400	2677400	Except he's presenting it more as a natural process where, at least in some number of cases,
2678400	2688400	what we might call a predominant or penultimate animal on a living planet that becomes,
2688400	2695400	I mean, this is so ironic, there's so much history here he doesn't understand, but it becomes representational.
2695400	2710400	And so, what that means is it's going to become more and more divorced from its own nature, origin, and context.
2710400	2717400	An analogy of this, which I think Eric would appreciate, is the fish has become allergic to water.
2717400	2720400	It's making itself allergic to water.
2720400	2729400	It's not going to become a bird, it's going to remain a fish, but it will become more and more allergic to the water because
2729400	2737400	it's intentionally doing something, 900 things to the water and 1000 new ones per second,
2737400	2748400	that make it impossible not merely for there to be fish, but for there to be organisms at all.
2749400	2759400	And Eric seems to think, well, one disagreement I would have with him is relatively simple.
2759400	2769400	A moment.
2773400	2780400	Eric would like it if, like Elon.
2781400	2789400	And, you know, Eric disagrees with Elon in a way similar to what I do.
2796400	2807400	Eric doesn't think Mars is a very attractive second wound, but Eric would like to give the humans the freedom to traverse the stars.
2807400	2815400	He's really angry the physics hasn't succeeded in the past, you know, since relativity at least, if not from before that,
2815400	2825400	has done mostly nothing except gaze, you know, hypno-aiically at string into the depths of string theory,
2825400	2834400	as demanded by Ed Whitten, the god of string theory,
2834400	2839400	which has failed, you know, to bring any horse to the race.
2839400	2841400	It's a horse race in this case.
2841400	2845400	String theory has neither horses nor runs races.
2845400	2850400	It just proposes the running of races for 50 years.
2850400	2862400	A time in which we should have made 10 important discoveries that could get us either to post scarcity consuming
2862400	2866400	or to space.
2866400	2870400	And by space he doesn't mean nearby solar systems.
2870400	2872400	He means space, the big stuff.
2872400	2875400	We can go to other stars.
2875400	2884400	And I think that releasing anything resembling modern humanity on time space is one of the dumbest ideas I've ever heard.
2884400	2895400	There's lots of analogies people use to describe the humans.
2895400	2900400	Often these analogies of children misbehaving.
2900400	2907400	Those analogies are okay, but the actual situation here is much weirder.
2907400	2915400	All the life phases of the humans are misbehaving together.
2915400	2929400	And goose stepping with the clockwork of protocols that are fundamentally lethal.
2929400	2941400	You can imagine the situation in which in a human body there was an overwhelming, sudden, overwhelming,
2941400	2943400	a curve rise.
2943400	2955400	A sudden, overwhelming curve rise in a signal that causes cells to die.
2955400	2964400	And they could die from, you know, maybe 10, there's probably 10 different ways for them to pass away.
2964400	2970400	So you can imagine first a signal within a single body that does this.
2970400	2984400	Essentially what's going to happen is that person will explode inflammation everywhere and then death.
2984400	2989400	The humans are generating a death signal.
2989400	3001400	And the one thing you really don't want to happen is for that to get out into time space at all, ever.
3001400	3011400	And as I've mentioned many times before, I think Ed Whitten probably did us a favor,
3011400	3021400	because if we'd actually made physical advancements over the past 50 years, it's entirely clear to me that they'd have been weaponized.
3022400	3031400	In case you haven't read much science fiction and you're not particularly imaginative about what humans would do,
3031400	3037400	given something like free energy, let me be absolutely clear.
3037400	3045400	There is zero chance of a post-scarcity world for the humans as they exist at present.
3045400	3070400	Because for there to be a post-scarcity world, the dominant financial, industrial, military, prison-eering forces would have to be either put out to pasture or destroyed.
3070400	3075400	Or, you know, you don't really have to destroy them, you just have to replace them.
3075400	3083400	They're not going to go quietly into the good night, though, unfortunately.
3083400	3087400	Or into the long night, as it may be.
3087400	3099400	Yeah, unfortunately those forces are so disoriented that if you threaten them directly, they'll take the world hostage.
3099400	3108400	And anyone who can see anything at all knows this is true.
3108400	3124400	In a sense, it's ironic, and there's a reason that we fight, quote-unquote, fight, that we interact with cancer in the human body by training a weapon on it, and that the weapon is radiation.
3125400	3138400	Because what you have is a cell that has become highly proliferative.
3138400	3143400	It just keeps making more of itself everywhere it can.
3143400	3152400	And so it's also the most expensive metabolic proposition you can table.
3152400	3163400	It will literally consume all of the metabolic energy of the body in many cases.
3163400	3173400	So it's as if it's sort of the opposite of a power plant.
3173400	3176400	It's a distributed, unpower plant.
3176400	3191400	And one of the things I'm going to suggest is that what is happening to the humans right now, and has been for a good six years or so, six years or six to nine years, maybe.
3192400	3204400	Is that there is a propagation of an unpower plant in a context we don't even have language for, or is very difficult for us to identify directly one of the two.
3204400	3210400	And again, anything that attacks what you identify correctly with, right?
3210400	3217400	I mean, this is in effect how you build a mind virus that can eat the entire population.
3218400	3228400	If they think there's something happening that they're unable to detect, particularly if only special people can detect it,
3228400	3236400	and I recognize the signature in a number of the current socio-political gambits, right?
3236400	3245400	Where something's wrong, something's fundamentally wrong, and unjust, although those things are true.
3245400	3255400	But only we know how to detect it, and those who don't agree with our detections aren't humans.
3255400	3259400	We shouldn't listen to them.
3259400	3262400	There should be no discussions with them.
3262400	3273400	There are to be no discussions, except among those who agree that the thing we're detecting is the problem.
3273400	3278400	And that problem is, for example, patriarchy, colonization.
3278400	3290400	You can pick up any monster you want, and you can collect the monsters into a kind of monster bracelet that you just keep adding to.
3290400	3297400	You know, it's true, for example, that mechanical time is tyrannical.
3297400	3301400	It's true.
3301400	3311400	Is wokeness, the answer is, is wokeness get to weaponize that fact for their benefit?
3311400	3320400	Thus claiming, you know, watches are patriarchal, time doesn't exist, mechanical time isn't true.
3320400	3332400	There are so many untrue things and so many injustices in common human thought and activity that if you're going to fund a meme set with them,
3332400	3341400	we are the ones who collect and display the injustices, and no one else shall do so, is a great way, it's a great source of funding.
3341400	3346400	Also, anything that suggests mutual victimhood, right?
3346400	3350400	What does a victim have to do?
3350400	3352400	Nothing, they just broadcast.
3352400	3355400	By the way, that's sort of what cancer cells do.
3355400	3359400	They don't do anything except reproduce and broadcast.
3359400	3362400	They just broadcast like crazy.
3362400	3379400	This leads to a problem called, oh god, the sudden explosive spread of cancer to many organs or tissues.
3379400	3382400	I can't recall the name of it right now.
3382400	3388400	My mind is on seven other subjects.
3388400	3393400	Perhaps it will come to me.
3393400	3401400	But yes, so they basically just, it's a reproductive, it's a cellular.
3401400	3410400	Okay, so is a cancer cell still a cell?
3410400	3414400	Obviously it belongs to the category.
3414400	3430400	Cancer cells are a kind of, you know, one thing a cell can become as cancer is.
3430400	3443400	But it's sort of like the question, I'm going to twist the language up, just warning you ahead of time here.
3443400	3449400	When is an assassin not a comedian?
3449400	3462400	When is a serial killer not funny?
3462400	3465400	Categories can be very misleading, can't they?
3465400	3475400	And if we demonstrate how misleading they can be with statements like that, or statements like,
3475400	3481400	this is the most important statement you will ever hear in English.
3481400	3494400	You can see how the humor is in a way the composition of a route in consciousness.
3494400	3510400	And then the sudden unexpected either disappearance of the route just goes poof, it's gone, or a radical transformation of it.
3510400	3521400	So that instead of, you know, we're going to a boat, and we walk along the path that should lead to a boat,
3521400	3524400	and we get to where the boat is, it's time space, right?
3524400	3525400	No, it's Saturn, right?
3525400	3534400	No, it's a certain breed of dog, or it's cat behavior, or anything you want to put there.
3535400	3540400	You can structure human consciousness so that it has basic expectations,
3540400	3548400	and then you can obliterate those artfully if you are a good comedian.
3565400	3578400	I think Eric is naive in that, and he'd probably be the first to admit this.
3578400	3584400	If I sat down and talked to him and asked him some clear questions, I suspect he'd admit this.
3584400	3587400	But he might say I don't care.
3587400	3589400	I think he's naive in two ways.
3589400	3601400	One, he thinks it's not just a good idea, but the natural next step in a progression to get humans propagating out there in time space.
3601400	3605400	And I don't think that's a very dumb idea.
3606400	3617400	The earth womb bubble is a context that's safe enough because it's enclosed for humans to experiment together at being human.
3617400	3626400	And you have to wait until some really good experiments, some really beautiful and noble and creative experiments,
3626400	3634400	and experiments that recall the virtues, particularly the virtue of memory.
3635400	3651400	You have to wait until such time as the group body of the humans are willing to compose and conduct and enact brilliantly beautiful experiments.
3651400	3668400	And those out-compete, they naturally out-compete what we might imagine to be their opposites, which are the malignant experiments,
3668400	3678400	and their propagation and domination activities.
3678400	3685400	And then I think Eric is naive in a second way, which is,
3685400	3694400	it wouldn't surprise me to discover that Ed Whitten is a puppet, tabled by intelligences, very profound intelligences,
3694400	3698400	that came to him with a bargain.
3698400	3709400	Like, we're going to give you two things at once, and you must accept them both, but you must enact the second one.
3709400	3717400	We'll give you the answers to the mysteries you're chasing, we'll feed them to you over time, and you'll be able to test them.
3717400	3721400	But you must release none of those to the humans.
3721400	3726400	What you do with the humans is entrance them with string theory.
3726400	3737400	Because it is reminiscent of what's actually going on, but we'll ensure they don't get the keys to the stars.
3737400	3748400	So, at least for another, it'll keep them busy for a couple hundred years, and then suddenly some clever young woman will be like,
3748400	3761400	Aha! I see the problem in string theory. This is wrong. She sweeps most of it away, and there revealed, you know, some ring of keys to the sky.
3761400	3776400	But I think he's naive. I think he seems to not take seriously the idea that other intelligences are necessarily engaged in structuring space-time.
3776400	3781400	And if they weren't before, they sure as fuck are now.
3781400	3791400	And it's not that they're unfriendly to humans. They're unfriendly to anything that masquerades as human.
3791400	3800400	Anything that pretends to belong to the category the same way a cancer cell does.
3800400	3809400	But it enacts a series of protocols that are fundamentally lethal to all forms of life, right?
3809400	3815400	The humans are indiscriminately on the sidle at the group level.
3815400	3829400	Thankfully, most of the individuals, though that it does occasionally get down into the individuals, and you'll see someone, often a male, go on some rampage.
3829400	3833400	And we're still some group of males, right?
3833400	3846400	Get them really amped up about some real or feigned injustice, and then give them guns, and direct them at any population, and watch them mayhem ensue.
3846400	3872400	The broken monkeys are ever more broken as our development proceeds, not ever less, as we might hope, imagine, and conceive of attempting to achieve together.
3872400	3889400	So I think he's naive in that there are other intelligences involved, and they would not want the problem that infests our species at the group level to emerge into time space.
3889400	3900400	And the fundamental, one of the most fundamental dangers there is that humans will just build machines that build machines, and we've seen plenty of science fiction about that.
3900400	3912400	But I think you'd have a hard time imagining how quickly you could go from trees and birds and flowers and insects still exist to they don't anymore.
3912400	3925400	Because I imagine you could get there in, just depends on how recursively self-amplifying what you do is, you can get there in an hour.
3925400	3934400	You could probably get there in an hour with an effective enough prosthesis.
3934400	3950400	And that doesn't mean, oh, there's no more life forms. That means that the entire history, the line of all of the living beings that ever lived here, ends there, poof, extinguished.
3950400	3956400	And there are people who will say, well, humans were a bad experiment to begin with. Right, William S. Burroughs might, but I doubt it.
3956400	3966400	I think he actually cares about the humans. And he's certainly aware there are other intelligences in time space.
3966400	3978400	So what I'm suggesting is, if physics suddenly delivered vehicles capable of interstellar travel, perhaps instantaneous interstellar travel,
3978400	3997400	we would very quickly find ourselves faced with, not enemies, but authorities that would just raise one finger toward, you know, our entire species and say, nope.
3997400	4006400	Stop doing stupid, deadly, lethal things and pretending those things are glorious.
4006400	4020400	There's nothing glorious about laying waste to the entire living history of your world and the possibility of human minds, their origin, their nature, their intrinsic purpose of endowments.
4020400	4030400	Stop putting an end to that. Stop trading that for trinkets and snack food.
4030400	4037400	Become a coherent species.
4037400	4055400	Doing any other thing is going to cost you everything. You no longer have the, you have wound the clock string of nature so tightly on your planet that there's no longer any play in it.
4055400	4065400	And the clocks that that tension usually funds, you've taken them apart at their basis.
4065400	4081400	So that thing is just building stress. And when it snaps, the repercussions will certainly, you know, be devastating to maybe everything.
4081400	4087400	I mean, there's other naivetés. The humans think they're the only game in town. They're nothing like the only game in town.
4087400	4093400	They're one of the weirdest games in town.
4093400	4110400	Anyone who just steps outside human culture long enough to look back at us from outside will see
4110400	4115400	that it depends on what they're looking for. If they're looking for the beauty, they can find it.
4115400	4132400	But if they're looking for absurd, omnicidal, self-devastation, I mean, our species acts like a guy who takes himself hostage while attempting to rob a bank.
4132400	4139400	It's so ridiculous from outside.
4139400	4148400	And, you know, anciently evolved intelligences would not be entertained by our japes.
4148400	4151400	They would not see our species as intelligent at all.
4151400	4157400	At the group level, we are bad. We're doing bad things.
4157400	4163400	Every single human being go to them and ask them. They'll tell you. Ask them the questions.
4163400	4172400	Do you trust what your species is doing? Do you trust what some nation is doing?
4172400	4182400	Any of them who are still in any way sober or connected with their own minds will say no.
4182400	4192400	Do you think the humans will establish a path to a sustainable and livable, humane, intelligent future?
4192400	4201400	No, they will not. Not the modern ones. Not the ones we have running around today.
4201400	4208400	So one of the things Eric was suggesting, which I agree with, is that something has affected our motivation very profoundly
4208400	4212400	in a relatively, you know, in the span of like one or two generations.
4212400	4216400	And maybe in a span much shorter than that.
4216400	4223400	Again, we're used to changes happening in pulses over time, much like contractions lead to birth.
4223400	4229400	We've eradicated the play in the clock spring.
4229400	4231400	Now they happen now.
4231400	4237400	Something that would have pulsed and given us a signal that it was coming just happens.
4237400	4242400	There's no pulsing.
4242400	4255400	We have learned using science to detect transformations in particular signals.
4255400	4261400	For example, signals from space to the surface of the earth.
4261400	4272400	Such that there's a bandwidth, there's some bandwidths we can watch.
4272400	4288400	And there's very good data to suggest that we can predict earthquakes by watching for a set of transformations.
4291400	4299400	In the duration of...
4299400	4302400	Ah, there it is.
4302400	4305400	Okay, up.
4305400	4314400	Then...
4314400	4320400	Sorry, I'm watching a blue heron.
4320400	4326400	It was about to do the old signal dance.
4326400	4339400	But then the wind where it's sitting became too...
4339400	4341400	too unstable.
4341400	4347400	It made its footing unstable, its basis unstable.
4347400	4358400	It's hard to do the dance when the thing your feet are on is moving.
4358400	4370400	Wow, maybe that's one of the messages this whole recording is about.
4370400	4387400	Because there's a lot of different variables that contribute to the stability or instability of the earth beneath our feet.
4387400	4396400	Anyone who's tried, for example, you could put some pontoons on or some magic sauce on the soles of your feet.
4396400	4398400	It'll allow you to float.
4398400	4402400	It'll allow you to step out onto the surface of the water.
4402400	4404400	Your chances of walking are zero.
4404400	4410400	You're going to fall down right now.
4410400	4420400	Because you need something probably more like complex ice skates than sneakers.
4420400	4426400	The surface of the water is much more slippery than ice.
4426400	4428400	So if you're going to walk on that.
4428400	4439400	What I was saying was there are both certain signals from the earth that are sent in an electromagnetic frequency range.
4439400	4462400	And at the same time, we can detect a change in how long it takes signals from, for example, GPS satellites to reach a location where they are received.
4462400	4473400	Subtle transformations in those signals were noticed before the Fukushima earthquake.
4473400	4490400	Now, of course, we have a big problem here and the problem is that academic science wants to continue failing to solve the problem of earthquake preparedness.
4490400	4503400	So again, we come to a situation where somebody brings them an answer and that person does not get to continue in their career or is viciously attacked.
4503400	4512400	So I just had an encounter with a crab spider inside a calla lily.
4512400	4519400	I haven't seen them in so many years and I'm really glad to see them here.
4519400	4523400	I'm unsure.
4523400	4531400	I've looked for them in Golden Gate Park.
4531400	4535400	I don't think I've ever seen one.
4535400	4542400	I've only seen them in a very specific garden in which I have not seen them for many years.
4542400	4554400	So that was kind of an exciting moment in nature.
4554400	4563400	I must remember what is it?
4563400	4565400	I must remember the moon.
4565400	4571400	The moon cycle.
4571400	4574400	No to it.
4574400	4580400	The ones I saw were female. I saw two of them in a small group of flowers.
4580400	4596400	That implies a much larger population than those two for there to be two on such a small group of flowers.
4596400	4601400	That could mean many things.
4601400	4618400	So yeah, I think we have to hope that the intelligence is involved in composing time space and probably involved in the composition of organisms
4618400	4628400	and possibly involved in the propagation of life across living worlds throughout time.
4628400	4641400	We would have to hope that...
4641400	4649400	You know, when I was in the bathroom a moment ago, I took a break, restroom break, there was a mosquito.
4649400	4661400	And it made me think of how humans, the kinds of mistakes that humans make in their attempts to control the mosquito.
4661400	4670400	Quote, unquote, control the mosquito population as if it's a separate thing from them.
4670400	4686400	And this is what I mean when I say, you know, we've defected from nature on purpose as a species.
4686400	4694400	You know, my friend Ryan Furstiver works with animals in Lethbridge.
4694400	4714400	He's part of the system in place to, in his words, protect the animals from humans.
4714400	4743400	And in his way of life, he is fulfilling important obligations as a human being to remember the intimacy of the filial relations between humans and at least the living world.
4744400	4753400	This causes him lots of problems.
4753400	4764400	In his quest for a mate, for example...
4765400	4773400	That was funny.
4773400	4777400	I'll come back to Ryan in a moment. The jogger who just passed me, she said,
4777400	4784400	in the sense that I ask so many questions and then I don't leave space for other people to do that.
4784400	4787400	I mean, that's familiar.
4787400	4798400	There's an even worse problem than that, which my son was speaking of the other night.
4798400	4812400	Imagine that you're so curious and insightful that you're constantly showing people problems in their behavior or their thought or their situation
4812400	4821400	and solutions, you're implying solutions, but they don't want a solution.
4821400	4831400	What they want is a relationship. They're trying to bond with you and you're, meanwhile, directing critical thought at them.
4831400	4843400	I don't mean critical in the DEI sense. I mean critical as in critical thinking skills.
4843400	4855400	We have to be careful these days because many features of our lexicon are being gobbled up by, I don't know, hopeful monsters.
4855400	4861400	We might call them.
4861400	4869400	So you can imagine a situation in which, for example, someone like myself, I'm very interested.
4869400	4872400	I think we're bonding.
4872400	4879400	My impression is that we're bonding around insight and questing and adventure and consciousness.
4880400	4891400	When I have never tabled that proposal for mutual agreement in any reasonable way,
4891400	4900400	and the other person is just trying to see, like, is there something warm here we can have together?
4900400	4903400	Human? Can we bond?
4903400	4922400	If I say I like the show on TV, is that likely to elicit a catastrophic critique of modern media and how it dumps us down?
4922400	4937400	That's a really uncomfortable position where if I have to preview in consciousness all the angles of the circle
4937400	4951400	where critical gaze can produce an issue, a problem, a judgment, a criticism,
4951400	4959400	pretty soon I can't speak at all.
4959400	4969400	I have close friends who struggle, and I love them, and I think they're heroic,
4969400	4972400	but they shouldn't have to be heroic alone.
4972400	4981400	They struggle to compose a spoken sentence in any actual conversation,
4981400	4985400	and perhaps much more so with me than anyone,
4985400	4996400	because they imagine that I will bring the momentum of my critical faculties to bear on them when they speak
4996400	5005400	in the same way that I do when I'm looking at human civilization, society,
5005400	5014400	what we call industry, war, etc., media, which is not going to happen.
5014400	5020400	If they ask me to do something like that directly, then maybe.
5020400	5028400	And I might nudge them a little here and there if I think they're trying,
5028400	5040400	like we're actually engaged in an intellectual conversation like I was yesterday with my friend Brian.
5040400	5047400	We were engaged in an intellectual conversation, and so we're both trying to nudge each other toward insight,
5047400	5057400	but again, I failed to put the proposal on the table that just says,
5057400	5062400	let's make some agreements, let's have some principles,
5062400	5070400	and one of them is that we will, in all honesty, integrity, and good faith,
5070400	5078400	attempt to help each other to see better together whenever we are seeing.
5078400	5087400	We will resist the urge to nurture our pet biases and perspectives.
5087400	5091400	We don't have to kill them, but we will resist that urge,
5091400	5101400	and we will go for what in the song title is like higher ground.
5101400	5106400	I think there's a couple of lyrics using that phrase, at least.
5106400	5112400	We'll go for a better perspective, and we're going to bring our hearts with us.
5112400	5117400	We're going to be emotional. We're not going to just be abstract.
5117400	5122400	We'll bring our hearts with us, and we will climb together.
5122400	5129400	We will help each other see more clearly, more usefully, more intelligently, more creatively,
5129400	5133400	than we have before, and some of that will be playful.
5133400	5139400	Some of that will be joking with each other.
5139400	5145400	I heard a rather captivating advertisement that utilized,
5145400	5150400	and by the way, I'm sure this is being weaponized as we speak,
5150400	5158400	but I heard a rather captivating advertisement in which it was pretty funny.
5158400	5169400	Both the guys are British, but one of them is speaking in, what would I call it?
5169400	5177400	People would call it more privileged language, the language of privilege, the English.
5177400	5182400	I'm not even sure if the primary speaker was British,
5182400	5187400	but he had a good chunk of British accent,
5187400	5193400	and was speaking in a relatively sophisticated character,
5193400	5208400	whereas the other guy is aping a sort of skillful moron.
5208400	5221400	And the advertisement was for a language teaching program.
5221400	5226400	So in the front, you have the guy who's giving you the pitch,
5226400	5244400	and in the background you have included a naysayer who is obviously japing, right?
5244400	5251400	He's playing a role, he's para, yeah, he's para-japing.
5251400	5260400	He's playing a character that is intentionally caricatured for effect,
5260400	5272400	and that kind of play is very effective for humans,
5272400	5288400	because we have evolved to doubt first advertising itself,
5288400	5300400	and then the monopolar accolades of advertising,
5300400	5306400	this product will change your life.
5306400	5312400	We'd like to hear detractors inside the advertisement.
5312400	5316400	If people put detractors inside the advertisement,
5316400	5319400	their advertising can become vastly more effective,
5319400	5323400	and somebody has noticed this fact,
5323400	5334400	particularly some brilliant young advertising copywriter has noticed this fact.
5334400	5342400	And I'm sure that's not the only time the tool's been employed,
5342400	5348400	but I found it sort of charming, which was bothersome.
5348400	5356400	And in a sense, what you want as an advertisement, excuse me, as an advertiser,
5356400	5366400	is anything that creates stickiness in consciousness, brand recognition, you want that.
5366400	5390400	And negative recognition can be useful, though it isn't always.
5390400	5396400	When it comes to topics like these, what's going on?
5396400	5398400	What problems are we facing?
5398400	5399400	Who is we?
5399400	5405400	What does we even mean in 2024?
5405400	5415400	Is that an outdated or archaic idea?
5415400	5420400	And who has captured we-ness and is weaponizing it?
5420400	5425400	And then, you know, problems like, well, what do we do?
5425400	5427400	What can we actually do?
5427400	5429400	Do you know what to do?
5429400	5435400	Darren, you see this problem.
5435400	5438400	You probably experienced the problem in your own life,
5438400	5442400	or you would not be focused in this way,
5442400	5446400	or the phenomena, even if we don't frame it as a problem.
5446400	5452400	You see these phenomena in your own life, in your own experience.
5452400	5456400	Look, let me be clear.
5456400	5459400	My lifespan here is limited.
5459400	5474400	I have reached the outer edges of the solar system of Darren's identity and imperatives.
5474400	5476400	I don't have to reproduce.
5476400	5485400	I'm not forced to try to make money every day by circumstances.
5485400	5488400	Which reminds me, I have to go back to my friend, Ryan.
5488400	5496400	So, you know, Ryan goes out on calls where people have what they consider to be a problem with an animal.
5496400	5505400	And usually a problem with an animal is kind of similar to some people thinking they have a problem with indigenous people.
5505400	5507400	And what is the problem?
5507400	5511400	They keep showing up.
5511400	5520400	Currently, our modern nations and societies,
5520400	5526400	we have a problem with a specific, it's not funny at all.
5526400	5527400	I'm not laughing because it's funny.
5527400	5532400	I'm laughing because it's ridiculously confusing and a mess.
5532400	5536400	We have a problem with certain kinds of religious fundamentalists.
5536400	5548400	Hopefully we have a problem with them who would like nothing more than to slaughter innocent people.
5548400	5554400	And there are different varieties of that disease among the humans.
5554400	5577400	We need to be very watchful when any population or organization becomes oriented by exclusionist propaganda.
5577400	5583400	Or anything resembling kill them all and let God sort them out.
5583400	5588400	Or anything resembling kill the infidels.
5588400	5590400	Just slaughter them.
5590400	5591400	Take great joy.
5591400	5593400	It's a holy purpose.
5593400	5603400	You can see the inversion of human purpose of intelligence in these charades that are devastating and horrifying when enacted.
5603400	5608400	Always being enacted all day long.
5608400	5614400	27 million times per minute.
5614400	5627400	We've created engines of dysphoric megalomania.
5627400	5631400	But any time we start to hear the cry, kill the infidel,
5631400	5642400	we're very carefully concerned with how we try to deal with the problems arising from that.
5642400	5655400	And it doesn't matter if the infidel, it doesn't matter who the infidel is.
5655400	5660400	And we're certainly hearing noises like that.
5660400	5667400	In the West, they haven't quite reached the pitch where you can openly say.
5667400	5678400	Where, for example, woke culture or extreme right-wing culture can get away with straight up saying, you know, kill other people.
5678400	5680400	But we're on the verge of it.
5680400	5704400	Often in nations, if this kind of disease gets started, it's either because war has been selected as the next move.
5704400	5708400	She notices it.
5708400	5714400	The dog saw that I was interested in something, so she came over and checked it out.
5714400	5721400	It's the natural response of the satellite intelligence.
5721400	5731400	They would like you to check out what they're interested in, but if you're in the dominant position, they will certainly check out what you're interested in.
5731400	5746400	So yeah, war is, when we see this kind of thing going on, war either has already been happening or it's next on the agenda or both and more.
5746400	5758400	Because you can bleed off if, okay, let's suppose, let's take a model, a toy box society.
5758400	5779400	The toy box society, and one thing that's happening in the society that is very alarming and disturbing, is that every few days, or even more often, some young or older male, and almost never females, goes batshit and saying,
5780400	5792400	loads up on guns in an homage to Kurt Cobain and kills a bunch of innocent people.
5792400	5798400	So in the sandbox, in our hypothetical mini world, we notice this is happening.
5798400	5806400	Well, there's two things you can do, and which one you're going to select depends a lot on what your underlying motivations are.
5806400	5817400	If your underlying motivations are intelligent and humane, what you do is you don't attack the symptom.
5817400	5819400	You don't attack the young men.
5819400	5835400	You might remove them from the capacity to repeat the behavior, and sometimes that may mean killing them because they've already decided that they're on a suicide mission.
5835400	5838400	For example, even then, you don't have to kill them.
5838400	5850400	But you study them, and you determine what was the genesis of this, and what you're going to find is that it's never merely mental illness.
5850400	5853400	Most likely, that's what you're going to find.
5853400	5859400	You're going to find out that the structure in the sandbox, the structure of the society, is wrong.
5859400	5860400	It is bad.
5860400	5861400	It's malignant.
5861400	5862400	It's lying.
5863400	5871400	And the poison it's producing gets concentrated, and men tend to concentrate it better than women,
5871400	5874400	or they both concentrated equally well.
5874400	5887400	They just concentrated differently so that one of the common expressions in men is sudden, inexplicable, relatively inexplicable mass murder.
5888400	5891400	Or, you know, you get the serial version of it.
5891400	5893400	You get a serial killer.
5895400	5903400	So when you see that, you can study and resolve, right, by changing the structure of your society,
5903400	5912400	and by repairing the value systems, the relational systems, the identity systems,
5912400	5919400	so that it's actually rewarding to participate, and there are endless opportunities for such participation.
5919400	5923400	There's no reason to have a society that isn't like that, right?
5923400	5935400	And yet, we do have the built-for-failure model that produces what might as well be cognitive, social, relational radiation.
5936400	5948400	And along with that, we're facing lots of weird kinds of actual physical radiation from devices, and electricity, and LEDs, and Wi-Fi, cell towers, and so forth.
5948400	5956400	And there's a group of people that will say, for example, there's no evidence of the name that's harmful.
5956400	5958400	Bullshit!
5958400	5966400	The membrane of every cell is an electromagnetic wonderland of delicate protein folding and other kinds of operations.
5966400	5970400	There's no way you can bathe those cells in noise and expect them to work well.
5970400	5977400	And there are certain kinds of noise that will definitely kill them off, or reduce their function catastrophically,
5977400	5983400	and that can happen so quickly that our data gathering doesn't track it.
5983400	5993400	The data is 100 years behind what nature is up to at this moment in human culture, most of the data.
5993400	5998400	You don't get a signal till long after it's too late to respond to it.
5998400	6015400	So the other protocol you can enact around when you notice that the men are, or that it's common, how should I put it?
6015400	6024400	It's too common, right? It's much more common than it should be, that young or middle-aged men explode into violence.
6024400	6032400	And it doesn't have to be, right, they kill up 70 people. It can be just focused on one person or a small group of people or something.
6032400	6040400	Again, punishing them is the wrong fucking idea, unless you're a prisoner, in which case you make money from punishing them.
6040400	6047400	Now you have an incentive to pretend, no, the problem is in that man, right, in the case of our sandbox, right?
6047400	6052400	It's not, it's in that man. We have to attack it back and make it pay for its crime.
6052400	6059400	There is no crime that has ever been committed that can be paid for. Crime is not a system of accounting.
6059400	6065400	It's not a commercial product. I mean, actually, it turns out it is a commercial product.
6065400	6073400	What I mean, though, is that if wrongdoing becomes an accounting system, we're fucked.
6073400	6082400	Because it means that basic relational integrity has collapsed and we're no longer cognizant.
6082400	6100400	We can't recognize that problem. It's the same thing I was mentioning earlier, where the matter at hand attacks what you would use to detect it with first.
6101400	6111400	And in case it's not obvious, there are similar features in nature, but do this.
6111400	6125400	One of the great examples, which tends to produce mad organ dysfunction, as well as oncogenesis, right?
6126400	6131400	Cancer making. Oh, the word I was looking for earlier.
6131400	6144400	Metastasized. That's when a localized cancer spreads suddenly and often explosively throughout related organs and or tissues.
6144400	6148400	Quite distant, metabolically, from the site at which it originates.
6148400	6160400	Think of the distance between, for example, well, any part of your body, let's say, your throat and your spleen.
6160400	6168400	And if you're thinking of the distance at the scale of human measuring, it's very close by.
6168400	6177400	But if you're thinking of the distance at the scale of cells, you're probably talking about a distance.
6177400	6186400	So are you. You're probably talking about a distance.
6187400	6197400	Oh, so funny. They were looking at a hair and hunting gopher and saying it's a beautiful site.
6197400	6201400	Yeah, for a cell, that's a huge distance. That's like light years away.
6201400	6209400	That's like there being a problem on earth and suddenly finding that the problem has.
6209400	6215400	And by the way, we should carefully think about such things this way.
6215400	6234400	It's like having a problem in a specific housing block in Cincinnati and then having it show up on a planet orbiting Rigel.
6234400	6241400	And the humans think, oh, there's no reason, there's no reason to believe that anything can connect earth and Rigel wrong.
6241400	6246400	They both come from the same mother. They might as well be twins.
6246400	6250400	They originate from the same context.
6250400	6255400	And notice when I say wrong, it's like I'm banging a gong.
6255400	6259400	Wrong, you know, just we should resonate. Nope, you got that.
6259400	6266400	That one, you missed that question on the test humans.
6266400	6275400	Metastasization. Okay, so let's ask ourselves a really weird question, which is an important one.
6275400	6286400	What is the opposite of social and relational metastasization of memorial metastasization?
6286400	6288400	Stuff that attacks our memory.
6288400	6300400	If humans are having a disease that attacks memory, they should back the fuck up and pause as a species.
6300400	6306400	And this is one, okay, so when a circle back, I know I'm bird walking a bit.
6306400	6312400	Our guy who's misbehaving one of the strategies you can employ.
6312400	6319400	If this starts to happen a lot in your society is you just direct the killing, right?
6319400	6325400	So you start wars or you participate in them.
6325400	6340400	Or, you know, you redirect the loss of human dignity, meaning, identity, role.
6340400	6344400	You redirect that loss toward a scapegoat.
6344400	6350400	And that works. And humans leaders have done this again and again throughout history.
6350400	6354400	It is well studied. It is well understood.
6354400	6359400	This is a thing that we often do as a species.
6359400	6366400	And primarily, it's hard to easily say what the role of the women in general is.
6366400	6370400	But this is something that happens to the men.
6370400	6383400	And the women are at least peripherally compromised or captured by this, if not directly.
6383400	6405400	You know, today, in our time, I imagine that conscription has become bisexual in the sense that it needn't make determinations about gender.
6405400	6412400	It can conscript anyone today.
6413400	6425400	A transformation that I consider tragic and perhaps quite devastating.
6443400	6449400	So one thing you can do is you can sort of bleed off.
6449400	6452400	You should study the problem and change.
6452400	6461400	We should use criminal behavior to understand its origins and transform our societies to reflect those new understandings and continue that process
6461400	6470400	and realize that whatever enlightenment might mean, it means something like this.
6470400	6481400	And some very conservative people will argue you're rewarding bad people for bad deeds.
6481400	6492400	And I will argue the context you're supporting necessitates bad deeds.
6492400	6499400	This may sound extremely liberal, but for example,
6499400	6515400	if our toy box nation is spending $10 trillion every 10 years on the possibility of war and devastating human conflict
6515400	6526400	and spending the rest of its money mostly just ripping the environment to shreds and stacking up paper and banks as a result,
6526400	6533400	we're not having a society yet.
6533400	6540400	If the academics are teaching fictions to our children and each other and supporting them,
6540400	6544400	we're not having education yet.
6544400	6549400	And by the way, education is the one thing that you can go after
6549400	6559400	that will definitely affect your capacity to detect that something is going after it.
6559400	6567400	It's actually the breadth and depth of one's not just representational education, though that matters too.
6567400	6576400	It's the depth and breadth of the diverse bases of one's education
6576400	6591400	that produces people who are not easily either A, deceived, or B, conscripted, or C, extorted into participation in atrocity.
6591400	6595400	And neither can we just say, like, well, it's all atrocity these days.
6595400	6598400	It's a big Disneyland of atrocity. True.
6598400	6601400	But that doesn't mean we can defect.
6601400	6606400	We still have an obligation to discover what it means to be human
6606400	6620400	and to redirect our societies towards something meaningful, true, beautiful, noble, trustworthy, with integrity, honesty, sincerity.
6620400	6627400	And the capacity to detect counterfeits of virtue.
6627400	6633400	I don't... I'm not...
6633400	6638400	I guess I'm concerned with the kind of insight that detects injustice.
6638400	6643400	But I might be more concerned at the moment, at this moment in history,
6643400	6656400	with the kind of insight that detects the counterfeiting of virtue.
6656400	6662400	And again, in the signal environment, if we were...
6662400	6666400	If we'd been trained in signal intelligence,
6666400	6676400	and we were observing the signals being sent in our cultures right now,
6676400	6685400	the dominating signal forms and species and motivations and so forth.
6685400	6688400	We would be more than worried.
6688400	6696400	We would realize, oh, shit.
6696400	6701400	We're not merely being invaded, and this is true of all nations.
6701400	6709400	We're not merely suffering in an obscure array of simultaneous invasions.
6709400	6724400	The fundamental basis of our humanity, of our cognition, of our relationships, of our language, of our politics, of our infrastructure,
6724400	6734400	and particularly the military, industrial, prison, mimetic context.
6734400	6743400	That shit's been captured and is being weaponized against us as a people, the whole people.
6743400	6755400	I mean, it's a little bit weirder because it's like that scene in Blade Runner where Harrison Ford is about to be
6755400	6770400	forcefully conscripted one more time to go hunt replicants, which it has been deduced,
6770400	6777400	are not willing to go to their time-synced death chamber on time,
6777400	6784400	and if they're going to be forced to, intend to take some of the other people with them to send a message.
6784400	6791400	Bad message, bad way of sending it, but I get it.
6791400	6797400	So he's facing his boss. I can't remember that actor's name at the moment.
6797400	6803400	Maybe it'll come to me.
6803400	6814400	The boss outlines the proposal and Ford says, no, I'm fucking retired. I don't want to kill anyone anymore.
6814400	6823400	And the boss says, you know the game, either with us or your little people.
6833400	6858400	I have such a deep reverence and respect for older humans now that I've tasted of their sorrows in my own life.
6858400	6871400	My God, the staggering isolation and loneliness burden of most elders,
6871400	6880400	along with a problem that we've skirted in this, I've skirted in this dissertation.
6880400	6890400	The problem of what happens if you don't have to go to work?
6890400	6902400	What happens to humans if they're, what actually happens if their needs are taken care of?
6902400	6907400	Hello.
6907400	6920400	There's an intrinsic need in us to be engaged in meaningful physical, psychological, relational, societal endeavors.
6920400	6929400	And that can be captured and weaponized and that's, you know, history is, modern history anyway is replete with examples of this.
6929400	6937400	But there is something fundamental in that we need.
6937400	6952400	Well, we can defect from relational starvation and educational asphyxiation or bombardment, both, right?
6952400	6956400	We can defect from either of those into work.
6956400	6974400	But optimally, we need to be doing, there is an intrinsic need to meaningfully employ our human bodies, minds, spirits.
6974400	6989400	And we're getting a lot of, I'll retract that.
6989400	7000400	We're in a situation where the context has transformed to produce endless forms of make work
7001400	7005400	that are anything but rewarding, yet do serve the purpose.
7005400	7009400	It's like the junk food of work, right? It's junk work.
7009400	7016400	And throughout history, we've heard again and again the echo, the resounding echo of a promise.
7016400	7020400	We will release you from work to become enlightened.
7020400	7024400	Okay, could happen.
7024400	7032400	We will release you from work or in prison hearing so that you can establish on enlightened society.
7032400	7049400	But the modes of that have to be established before...
7049400	7056400	It's like you need to have that stuff spun up before you stop giving humans work.
7056400	7067400	And in the interim, when it's not yet spun up and the human desire or possibility of meaningful work is evaporating worldwide.
7067400	7078400	You might want to pay attention to the origin of that signal because it might mean, and I think it does mean, at least in part and possibly in large part,
7078400	7091400	that the role humans play in the network of minds and in the network of life on Earth
7091400	7099400	has gotten rid of the necessities that gave birth to humans.
7099400	7108400	Or it's gotten rid of its reach the boundary conditions under which you want to get rid of that process.
7108400	7118400	There are all kinds of processes where the earthquake in Fukushima is a good example.
7118400	7123400	You have a nuclear reactor built on a fault.
7123400	7127400	The unthinkable happens tidal wave from earthquake.
7127400	7131400	Earthquake itself may have damaged the reactor. I can't remember.
7131400	7134400	But the tidal wave was like the death knell.
7134400	7141400	So now you have a process that is spinning out of control and can kill everything around it for large.
7141400	7144400	And you can have the same problem on a planet.
7144400	7149400	You can have a planet where a process gets started that can spread to the other planets.
7149400	7151400	It can metastasize to them.
7151400	7159400	If there's a real-time relationship between planets in space-time, a possibility I would like to strongly emphasize as very likely,
7159400	7164400	then what happens on our planet costs lives on other planets.
7164400	7175400	There's a degree to which the planets can act as a buffer against developmental damage to organismal membranes in time-space.
7175400	7182400	They can share that burden the same way three humans can lift 400 pounds without much trouble.
7182400	7194400	But if one of those humans keeps stacking 100-pound weights and isn't lifting anymore, they're contributing burden,
7194400	7202400	there's going to be a reciprocal transformation of the relationship, and it will not be fun.
7202400	7209400	It won't be pretty.
7209400	7215400	You know, it isn't nature that's red in tooth and claw,
7215400	7225400	though the problem faced by embodied organisms that have to feed themselves is real.
7225400	7233400	But compared to nature, the humans are blood-drenched.
7233400	7239400	They're just like half-zombie, half-vampire, monster.
7239400	7249400	And of course, the individual humans aren't like that, but the species at the group level, they are completely disoriented,
7249400	7258400	they are omnicidal, arbitrary in judgment, kill this one, save that one.
7258400	7265400	Not intelligent.
7265400	7269400	Not survivable.
7269400	7273400	So one of the signals we might be seeing here,
7273400	7282400	when I talk about what took place in 2018 for me and many people that I know,
7282400	7286400	is we might be seeing a senescence signal.
7286400	7292400	If we are one of the cellular cultures of the animal that is Earth or the meta-animal, right,
7292400	7301400	because she produces animals naturally as a result of having stabilized her environment and so forth,
7301400	7315400	then, you know, something needs to interfere to either reduce our population dramatically,
7315400	7322400	and perhaps it's not, I would argue that it's not our population that's the actual problem.
7322400	7333400	The actual problem is object proliferation, dead structure that keeps reproducing instead of living structure.
7333400	7340400	Okay, any agenda like that, any system like that, that's got a very fucking limited lifetime.
7340400	7347400	It might have worked in the 1950s, it isn't going to work for 10 more years.
7347400	7352400	So the object proliferation is actually the problem, and you can, you know,
7352400	7360400	you can probably wreck up enough humans to interfere with that without eliminating the species or destroying the planet.
7360400	7370400	If you were an intelligent, you know, what I'm trying to figure out is like the human relationship with mosquitoes,
7370400	7382400	which is very deep and intimate, unlike what we would think,
7382400	7389400	is a caricature of what an actually intelligent non-human intelligence or collective of such intelligences
7389400	7402400	would be likely to propose and enact in relation to the problem with the humans and their predilection
7402400	7413400	to value objects and concepts over biospheres.
7413400	7422400	That is definitely a disease you do not want propagating freely in time space.
7422400	7432400	Machines that build machines, machines in general, damage and array of resources the humans are unaware of the existence of.
7432400	7435400	And one of those resources is biorelational time.
7435400	7447400	That is the foundation of minds for embodied beings, and particularly around here.
7447400	7452400	So, you know, the humans keep building new kinds of guns to point at new features of nature,
7452400	7458400	and then pulling the trigger over and over again, especially in modern history,
7458400	7468400	by which I mean like, I don't know, past 3,000 years or something in this case.
7468400	7476400	What you don't necessarily need to kill the humans, you have to get them to stop making guns.
7476400	7486400	You have to get them to make something that contributes to the ancient agreements among living beings
7486400	7494400	and their prosperity and survival and development and hope, and maybe even fulfillment.
7494400	7502400	Because what parents don't so much mind a lot of suffering, if they know their children will prosper,
7502400	7507400	eventually they don't care about themselves, they just care about those they love,
7507400	7512400	and for many of those parents, those they love are the living world.
7512400	7514400	There are the animals and plants and insects.
7514400	7521400	They look very generously and adoringly upon the face of life on earth,
7521400	7531400	and meet it with reverence and adoration, with wonder, with recognition, with re...
7531400	7534400	with an amnesis, right? Unforgetting.
7534400	7539400	They need it, and it causes them to forget, and they drink that water.
7539400	7547400	They need that water of life.
7547400	7550400	There is a path for us forward.
7550400	7555400	I think we have to cut our teeth on simple tasks we can do in small groups,
7555400	7560400	and learn how to forge those groups, how to experiment,
7560400	7566400	and play at the experiment of understanding how to solve something
7566400	7570400	that will really be meaningful for us to resolve,
7570400	7575400	or to help someone who is, you know, struggling, or in trouble, or is alone,
7575400	7581400	or to help the animals, or the biosphere.
7581400	7591400	You know, it's unfortunate that concern for the environment has become associated with wokeism.
7591400	7606400	Again, it's another of the plastic gemstones that you can glue on to any mimetic pathology
7606400	7611400	in order to help it propagate faster.
7611400	7620400	And by the way, to be really clear, I'm very concerned about what I think of as wokeism.
7620400	7629400	However crudely that idea may be formed in my mind.
7629400	7640400	The effective and creative response to actual injustice,
7640400	7644400	the intelligent response to such matters,
7644400	7660400	that's something I deeply believe in, I think, is natural to human beings, to care about that.
7660400	7671400	There's an owl here, a male, I'm pretty sure.
7671400	7683400	There's also a band shell right nearby emitting amplified music.
7683400	7684400	Way up top.
7684400	7685400	Ah, thank you.
7685400	7694400	Oh no, the lights came on.
7694400	7698400	I wonder how painful that is for the owls.
7698400	7702400	Oh, the lights adjust.
7702400	7707400	The lights are adjusting their brightness based on movement.
7707400	7719400	It's very interesting.
7719400	7726400	The first voice was the female.
7726400	7737400	The higher pitched voice in the owls was the female.
7737400	7742400	There goes the female and there goes the male.
7742400	7746400	Following her.
7746400	7749400	But not.
7749400	7752400	They intend to continue there.
7752400	7754400	It's really interesting.
7754400	7767400	The male traveled with the female until she perched and then he diverged, not going to her perch.
7767400	7782400	Which in a sense means the continuation of courtship and not what you can guess might otherwise ensue.
7782400	7787400	Well, I've explored so much terrain today.
7787400	7795400	There is a feature I want to highlight that the humans need meaningful mutual endeavors.
7795400	7800400	This has been replaced by the idea of work.
7800400	7809400	And simply we tend to have these two polar divisions, jobs and recreation, jobs and entertainment.
7809400	7817400	And both of those are highly captured and dangerous in their modern formats.
7817400	7829400	So we have to reestablish both and perhaps make a mix where we play at doing things together that are noble and true and virtuous and brilliant.
7829400	7838400	And hilarious and amazing and resurrecting, rescuing, healing, nurturing all these things.
7838400	7846400	We have to play at forming behaviors of these sorts together and then enacting them.
7846400	7850400	Or so I strongly think.
7850400	7855400	I suspect the distant music is spooky and haunting.
7855400	7863400	I want to thank all of you who have traveled with me today and those of you who will travel with me in the future or the past.
7863400	7871400	Please take a moment, if you will, to do what I won't hear request.
7871400	7874400	But you'll understand what I mean.
7874400	7881400	I look forward to learning and exploring together again very soon.
7881400	7890400	May your world and relationships be vital, beautiful and inspiring.
7890400	7894400	Until next time, bye-bye for now.
