Checking Darin Stevenson/Ad Hominem ｜ Woke-ish 'Feminist' Ideology.txt
 Terry Patten reflects on the impact of divisive narratives and the dangers they pose to societal cohesion, particularly in the context of contemporary American anti-culture. He expresses concern over the hypercontagious nature of these divisive narratives, which can lead to factionalism and suspicion among people. Terry emphasizes the importance of creating a relational context that fosters mutual understanding and respect, rather than indicting each other.

He specifically addresses the dynamic between men and women, acknowledging the challenges faced by both groups. Terry points out that the problem is not men versus women but rather the toxic developmental contexts and media influence that shape their interactions. He notes that objectification occurs differently for men and women, with men often being viewed as combatants or warriors.

Terry also critiques his own approach in this recording, recognizing the irony of him, who opposes indicting minds, engaging in a form of indictment by criticizing the mindset that creates divisive narratives. He expresses uncertainty about the value of this particular conversation and whether to publish the recording due to feeling under the weather and somewhat conflicted.

Despite these internal reflections, Terry ends with a message of hope, encouraging listeners to continue learning and growing together. He wishes his audience well, hoping for beauty in their ways and joy in their lives. He concludes by expressing gratitude to those who joined him in this exploration and invites them to join him again in future conversations.

Checking Darin Stevenson/Ammon Hillman, Medusae, 'Knowledge'.txt
 Jordan Peterson had a conversation with a woman who seemed dismissive of his interest in her collection of books, which included "The Child Garden" by Geoff Reiman. He noted that the topics he and Amon Hillman were discussing were deeply significant and touched upon the origins of human knowledge and the true nature of the universe. Amon spoke about ancient women who were skilled in creating drugs within their own bodies, referencing the third ventricle in the brain and the medicinal use of serpents in historical contexts.

Jordan expressed that modern perspectives on medicine and other profound subjects are often based on delusional ideas due to a puritanical opposition to understanding these original stories. He emphasized the importance of divesting ourselves from these obstacles to gain true insight.

He shared his fascination with the connection between the snake in the tree in the Garden of Eden and insight, and how this ties into his ongoing exploration with Ryan Firstiver of a mystery in the black foot lore involving a moon falling in love with a many-legged snake living in a hollow log.

Jordan encouraged listeners to seek blessings and insight, and he concluded by wishing everyone well on their paths, hoping they would find liberation and insight, and reminding them to remove the plank from their own eyes to taste the nectar of true understanding.

Checking Darin Stevenson/Bala Pillai - In Conversation.txt
 The conversation revolves around the idea of returning to a state of human society that was prevalent 500-600 years ago, particularly in the speaker's ancestral villages. These were times characterized by zero crime, embodied currency, and embodied learning, among other positive aspects. The speaker expresses a desire to emulate the harmonious lifestyle of their forefathers, which has seemingly deteriorated in modern times.

The speaker critiques the current state of professions like law, where some practitioners engage in unethical behavior such as cheating and screwing their customers, reflecting a broader issue of people following societal norms rather than relying on their intellect to choose ethical paths.

The conversation also touches upon the importance of understanding the topology of professional groups to identify those who are not falling into the "worst common denominator" and who share a desire for a more noble and human-centric society.

The speaker emphasizes that the dreams and aspirations of our ancestors do not have to be forgotten or dismissed in a single generation and that there is potential for positive change without resorting to cults or politics, but rather through a human-focused approach.

Both parties agree on the importance of exploring and understanding these ideas further and are open to experimenting, playing, growing, learning, discovering, and remembering how to live in harmony with these noble ideals. They express a willingness to continue this conversation and collaborate on making such societal transformations a reality.

The discussion concludes with both parties being grateful for the educational exchange and agreeing to revisit the topic in the near future after some food and rest. The tone is one of optimism and a shared commitment to exploring paths toward a more ideal human society.

Checking Darin Stevenson/Brains, Birds, Vigilance： Capturing Nervous Systems.txt
1. **Organism First**: The concept of the singularity of an organism is paramount; it encompasses the entire body, its extended environmental relationships, and the history and future of life on Earth. Every part of the organism (like the brain) depends on the whole, and similarly, human actions have far-reaching impacts on the Earth as a living organism.

2. **Human Impact**: Humans are acting like a destructive organ of the Earth, overexploiting resources, leading to pollution and habitat destruction. The current human behavior is not sustainable or beneficial for the planet.

3. **Brain Complexity**: The complexity of the human brain may be due to the Earth naturally producing complex meta-symbiotic cognitive entities that can engage in sophisticated interactions with their environment. These entities should align with the noble missions of living beings.

4. **Population and Objects**: The issue is not just the number of people but what they do—particularly, the proliferation of objects that come at the expense of living beings.

5. **Intelligence and Malignancy**: Large groups of humans often exhibit malignant intelligence, harming themselves and the environment. Small, bonded groups of humans can be highly intelligent and have a positive impact.

6. **Collaboration and Adventure**: To harness human potential, individuals should join small groups with shared missions to engage in meaningful adventures and relationships within the living world. This approach can lead to personal growth, new abilities, and profound learning experiences.

7. **Encouragement for Action**: The speaker encourages listeners to form meaningful connections with other humans, to define a mission together, and to embark on shared adventures to enhance human intelligence and transcendence.

8. **Conclusion**: The message is one of hope and a call to action for a harmonious existence with the Earth and among humans, emphasizing the importance of collaboration, creativity, and a sense of shared purpose.

1. **Biorelational Time**: This is the foundation of minds for embodied beings, particularly humans, and it's essential for understanding the interactions between living organisms and their environment. It's the time frame in which living beings relate to each other and their surroundings, and it's been significantly impacted by human actions, especially with the invention of weapons.

2. **The Human Predicament**: Humans have a history of creating tools for destruction, like guns, but what's needed is the creation of tools that contribute to the well-being of life on Earth. The focus should be on fostering agreements among living beings that promote their survival, development, and prosperity.

3. **Parental Love and Nature**: Parents often care deeply about their children's futures more than their own comfort. This love for one's offspring can extend to all of nature, leading to a reverence for life and a commitment to its preservation.

4. **Overcoming Wokeism**: Concern for the environment should be separate from any association with "wokeism" or other forms of mimetic pathology. Addressing real injustices and environmental issues requires intelligent, creative, and humane responses.

5. **Meaningful Mutual Endeavors**: Humans need to engage in meaningful activities together, moving beyond the modern dichotomy of work (jobs) and leisure (entertainment/recreation). These endeavors should be noble, virtuous, and collaborative, fostering community and shared goals.

6. **The Role of Owls**: The presence of owls and their behavior is used as a metaphor to illustrate the importance of mutual endeavors and the complex nature of human social interactions. The owls' courtship behavior highlights the need for ongoing, meaningful connections between individuals.

7. **Reestablishing Work and Play**: Humans should redefine both work and play to be meaningful and life-affirming activities that contribute to a better world, rather than being captured by the dangerous and modern formats of jobs and entertainment.

8. **Farewell and Invitation**: The speaker thanks the audience for their company and encourages them to continue exploring and learning together. The speaker expresses hope for vital, beautiful, and inspiring relationships and worlds and looks forward to future interactions.

In essence, the message is a call to action for humans to realign their focus from destructive to constructive endeavors, fostering a harmonious relationship with nature and each other, through meaningful and collaborative activities.

Checking Darin Stevenson/Imagination ⧸ Intellect ： ＂Modes of Justice＂.txt
1. You've touched upon the importance of communal experiences and their impact on our sense of identity and behavior. A brief example of this was observed during a reenactment event at Strawberry Hill, which, despite its fleeting nature, had a profound influence.
2. The discussion then shifted to the overwhelming challenges we face today, such as environmental issues like microplastics, which seem insurmountable. This can lead to feelings of despair and hopelessness about our ability to enact change.
3. In response to this despair, the conversation highlighted the principle that living a beautiful, authentic, passionate, and loving life has intrinsic value, regardless of the external outcomes. This principle was exemplified by Socrates, who dared to question established norms and encourage critical thinking among the people of Athens.
4. The discussion emphasized that democracy is not merely about voting but involves the communal preservation and purification of the context of our relationships, allowing us to act in accordance with truth and avoid malignant forces that harm society and history.
5. Finally, the speaker encouraged embracing the spirit of inquiry and learning ancient languages, like Greek, to ask profound questions and engage deeply with our existence, inspiring a path towards historical significance and a noble and beautiful life.

Checking Darin Stevenson/Intelligence.txt
1. **Human Imperatives**: We are born with noble imperatives to care for each other, our ancestors, our progeny, and the future of life on Earth. These imperatives are often compromised by societal structures that prioritize profit over human well-being.
   
2. **Loneliness and Enslavement**: The absence of meaningful human experience, identity, opportunity, and relation leads to feelings of isolation and enslavement, which in turn perpetuate systems of harm and injustice.

3. **Justice as Liberation**: True justice is about liberating individuals from harm and preventing future wrongdoings, rather than punishing people in a way that ensures the reenactment of injustice.

4. **The Prison System**: The current prison system is likened to a for-profit slave-naping system, serving the interests of the wealthy and perpetuating cycles of violence and harm.

5. **Implementing Understanding**: The challenge lies in implementing our understanding of these issues in ways that support recovery operations, celebrate our humanity, and foster environments where our more than merely human natures can thrive.

6. **Conversation as Action**: Engaging in conversations like the one described is a step towards recognizing our potentials and opportunities as living beings and as part of a collective human experience.

7. **Personal Responsibility**: By focusing on individual actions and localized efforts, we can transform seemingly insurmountable problems into achievable goals.

Checking Darin Stevenson/Magic ｜ Knowledge ｜ Intimacy.txt
 In this conversation, the speaker reflects on the nature of power, particularly the physical strength of certain groups, and contrasts it with the desire for intimate, participatory connections among people. They express a longing for a transformative and healing engagement that arises from deep understanding and insight, rather than mere justice. The speaker laments the modern tendency to name and categorize almost everything, which has led to a loss of direct experience and connection with the natural world and each other.

The speaker suggests that our current way of being in time—dominated by cities, roads, shops, and buildings—has alienated us from the ecstatic and transcendent aspects of existence. They emphasize the importance of reconnecting with the living world around us, which is full of wonders and beauty, and which can bring us into a state of visionary awareness if we let it.

The speaker also touches on the role of media and technology, particularly television, in distracting us from more meaningful, communal, and organic experiences. They advocate for a return to group dreaming, telepathy, and shared missions that are central to our true nature and potential.

Ultimately, the speaker's message is one of hope and inspiration for rediscovering and embracing the ecstasies and beauty inherent in our origins, natures, and potentials. They encourage listeners to engage with the natural world and each other in a way that honors both their ancestors and their progeny, and to resist the dehumanizing effects of modernity, war, commerce, and representation.

The speaker invites the audience to like, comment, or ask questions on the platform they are using, emphasizing the importance of community and shared experiences in spreading their message of connection and vitality. They conclude by expressing gratitude for the opportunity to share their thoughts and by wishing everyone beauty in their ways, lightness in their hearts, and exquisite relationships.

Checking Darin Stevenson/Modes of Awareness ｜ Recursion ｜ Feedback.txt
 In this conversation, the speaker discusses various aspects of consciousness and awareness, including the self-reflexive nature of dreaming and how it does not face outward but rather mirrors reality. The speaker also touches upon the idea of ordinary consciousness and how discussing these esoteric topics can help us step outside of our habitual thought patterns without fully descending into madness.

The speaker references Patrick McGowan's TV series "The Prisoner" as an example of a narrative exploring the folding of consciousness back upon itself, which is a process not limited to any one individual or discipline but is universal across many fields and experiences.

Meditation is likened to becoming an observer of the mind from above, akin to observing the surface of water, and this practice can help us navigate changes in our perception and reality, such as the dissolution of mental constructs. The speaker shares personal insights into the nature of consciousness, identity, and the potential for transcendence, using metaphors like water, eddies, currents, and a spider's web to describe the fluidity and traps of thought patterns.

The conversation concludes with the speaker expressing a desire to explore these topics further and invites listeners to join in this journey of learning and self-discovery, emphasizing the beauty of the way and day ahead for everyone involved. The speaker signs off, looking forward to future discussions and wishing well to those who have joined in this dialogue.

Checking Darin Stevenson/NS Capture, Cats, Darwin's Actual Scope....txt
 The discussion revolves around a concept where a "popcorn machine" metaphor is used to describe a hypothetical mechanism that generates universes. In this model, the universe we inhabit is one of many produced by this machine. Most of these universes are short-lived and non-viable because their fundamental forces do not interact in a way that allows them to continue existing (i.e., they don't persist in time). Only the universes where conditions are just right—akin to our own "Goldilocks" universe—can sustain themselves, leading to the emergence of observers like us.

This explanation attempts to address the fine-tuning problem without invoking a deity. It posits that through some form of natural process (a "universe progenitor field"), universes are continuously generated, and only those with the right balance of constants and forces can develop into complex structures where life can arise and observe its surroundings.

The speaker acknowledges that this theory is fascinating and thought-provoking, as it offers a naturalistic explanation for the fine-tuning we observe in our universe without resorting to a designer or supernatural force. However, the speaker also notes that there are significant issues with the origin of life on Earth and the doctrine that life could only arise on planets, which is a prevailing belief in modern science.

The speaker expresses gratitude to the audience for their support and encourages viewers to engage with the content, whether through likes, shares, or direct financial contributions. The video concludes with the speaker emphasizing the importance of community support in continuing to produce such content and expressing appreciation for the viewers' engagement.

The conversation ends with an invitation for Darren to visit the UK, and Lee extends an invitation to him to explore sacred sites in California, should he ever decide to travel there. They conclude with well-wishes and excitement for future opportunities to learn together and continue their journey of discovery. The discussion underscores the transformative power of human connection and the shared pursuit of understanding and wisdom.

Checking Darin Stevenson/Organisms, Spiderwebs, Assembly Theory.txt
1. **Assembly Theory**: This is a new scientific theory that could potentially have as significant an impact as Einstein's relativity. It concerns the complexity of systems and whether this complexity implies the intervention of intelligence or transcendence in their creation. Assembly theory might offer empirical ways to determine if an object or element could have originated without intelligent design or purposeful activity.

2. **Cronin vs. Sheldrake**: The podcast discusses the tension between Cronin, who is dismissive of Rupert Sheldrake's ideas on morphogenesis, and the potential overlap between assembly theory and Sheldrake's concepts. Morphogenesis suggests that patterns in nature can emerge spontaneously without a central control or intelligence guiding them.

3. **Ethical Implications**: The podcast references a story by Harlan Ellison where a scientist creates a weapon of mass destruction, which leads to a reflection on the ethical considerations of doing "whatever can be done." The story serves as a cautionary tale against creating destructive power simply because it is possible to do so.

4. **Intelligence and Prohibition**: The podcast emphasizes that intelligence isn't just about doing things but also about knowing what not to do—what must not be done for intelligent life to continue existing.

5. **Empirical Determination**: Assembly theory could provide a method to empirically determine if something could have originated without intelligent intervention, potentially offering proof of God or intelligence in nature.

6. **Potential Outcomes of Assembly Theory**: The podcast speculates that assembly theory might either be completely defeated (which seems unlikely), partially defeated with its scope limited, or it might revolutionize our understanding of objects, identity, interactions, and the historical development of these concepts.

7. **Encouragement for Listeners**: The speaker encourages listeners to explore assembly theory further, as it promises significant implications for science and could potentially confirm or challenge existing theories, including those related to the nature of reality and consciousness.

Checking Darin Stevenson/Recovering Human History from Within ⧸ Origins of Colonization.txt
1. **Neural Pruning**: In early development, neurons in our brains undergo a process called pruning, where excess or non-essential neural connections are removed, much like the differentiation process where some cells specialize while others are 'burned off.' This process contributes to making each individual unique.

2. **Mother's Concern**: The concerns of a mother, who invests in building her child's body from her own, serve as a more trustworthy anchor for understanding the relationship between organisms and their environment than detached rationalism.

3. **Recovering Origins**: There is a need to return to memory, humanity, insight, virtue, and mutual concern to understand and enhance human cooperative abilities.

4. **Confronting Anti-Culture**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of addressing the problems caused by forces that exploit human potential for profit, which can be seen as an extension of slavery.

5. **Technology and Surveillance**: Modern technology, while not directly causing death, can lead to fates worse than physical demise through the erosion of our interior assets and potentials.

6. **Alertness to Change**: Any influence that affects our capacity to discern change can open the door to exploitation on a global scale. It's crucial to remain vigilant and responsive to such threats.

7. **Communal Responsibility**: There is an urgent call for collective action, intelligence, resilience, and activity to oppose forces that undermine our well-being and autonomy.

8. **Human Potential and Ancestral Legacy**: The speaker encourages a connection with the past—our ancestors and their dreams—to fulfill their hopes and restore our interior assets.

9. **Gratitude and Encouragement**: The speaker is grateful for the opportunity to engage in conversation and encourages listeners to find joy, beauty, healing, and profound understanding in their lives.

10. **Closing Thoughts**: The speaker hopes that their musings will inspire a sense of heroic questing, recovery, and rescue, and they look forward to continued learning and exploration together. They sign off expressing appreciation for the audience's attention and engagement.

Checking Darin Stevenson/The 9th Fiction ( Prisoneering in Human Cognition ).txt
1. **The Fiction of Communication**: The idea that a conversation between collectives can be intelligently oriented, humane, human, trustworthy, or worthy of our service or attention is a misconception. True communication is an intimate, sensitive, and mutual synergy for noble and amnoetic purposes to remember together.

2. **The Fiction of Telepathy**: You are neither telepathic nor not telepathic. The concept of telepathy is a limitation that can be transcended through intimacy and shared understanding.

3. **The Fiction of Limitation**: Our perceived limitations, whether in intelligence or capabilities, are fictions. We exist to explore our origins and potentials together.

4. **The Fiction of Forgetfulness**: We were born to un-forget the ways and beauty of our nature and mission, which we carry forward in physical reality.

5. **The Fiction of Solitude**: We are not alone in the universe or on Earth. Anciently astonishing transcendent minds participate in the formation of living worlds, including ours.

6. **The Fiction of Human Aloneness**: Humans are not alone; we are in direct relationship with non-human intelligences that are integral to our existence.

7. **The Fiction of Individual Isolation**: You are not alone. The idea that an individual is separate and isolated from a larger cosmic consciousness is a misconception.

8. **The Fiction of Human Dominance**: Humans are the most dangerous form of life on Earth, but we are not the dominant form. Cells, bacteria, and viruses likely hold that position.

In conclusion, these fictions serve as gateways to understanding our true nature, potentials, and relationships with the cosmos and each other. By recognizing and inverting these fictions, we can forge a path towards a more profound and beautiful existence.

Checking Darin Stevenson/Track(ing), Categories, Orientation to Detail.txt
1. **Identity Categories**: The discussion revolves around the complexities of identity categories, particularly gender and sexuality, and how they are perceived and defined. The speaker acknowledges that these categories can lead to injustice if not approached with care and understanding.

2. **Biological vs Social Constructs**: The speaker points out that while there are biological aspects to gender, the social constructs we place on these categories are equally significant and can have profound effects on society and individual lives.

3. **Language and Categories**: Language and the categories we use can be deeply impactful in shaping our thoughts, relationships, and behaviors. The speaker emphasizes that any changes to fundamental categories should be approached with a willingness to question standing presuppositions.

4. **Personal Boundaries and Respect**: The speaker expresses a personal stance on the use of terms like "woman," which is informed by both biological realities and respect for individuals' self-identification. They advocate for mutual respect and understanding in discussions about identity, without imposing power dynamics through language policing.

5. **Openness to Learning**: The speaker acknowledges that there is much more to learn about gender, identity, and the intersections of these concepts with biology, society, and individual experience. They invite engagement and dialogue from the audience to further explore these topics.

6. **Conclusion**: The speaker concludes by encouraging viewers to be healthy, joyful, and well-loved, and invites comments, thoughts, and concerns on the topic discussed. They sign off, looking forward to continuing the conversation in future discussions.

Checking Darin Stevenson/UFOs ｜ Grusch ｜ Knapp and Implications ( also： frame collapse, etc ).txt
1. The speaker begins by discussing the limited perspective one might have based on their own experiences, which can be particularly narrow if one has never traveled or ventured beyond a certain environment. This limited perspective can be misleading about the true diversity and complexity of the world.

2. The speaker emphasizes that the world is far more diverse than most people realize, with countless unique human worlds existing even within different regions or historical periods on Earth alone.

3. They mention the concept of "escaping" one's familiar environment to experience the broader reality, which can be likened to achieving escape velocity from a small slice of life. This idea resonates with the "overview effect" experienced by astronauts who see Earth from space and realize its fragility and beauty.

4. The speaker suggests that every individual's living space or home is like a universe unto itself, offering a unique perspective on life. They highlight the distinct worlds found within different cultures, societies, and even in a single continent or shop.

5. The speaker expresses gratitude to their audience for engaging with their content, whether through listening, supporting, or contributing questions and comments. They note that this community's support is vital since there are no advertisements to monetize the recordings.

6. The speaker concludes by looking forward to future explorations of consciousness, memory, and shared experiences with the audience and encourages listeners to continue exploring their own worlds in a spirit of wonder and learning.

7. The speaker's message is one of appreciation for the diverse experiences and cultures that exist within our world and the importance of expanding one's horizons beyond the immediate environment to understand the broader tapestry of human life.

Checking Darin Stevenson/You don't know from....txt
 Alan Watts recounts an experience where he attended a performance of a channeled ancient warrior. A woman in the audience was chosen to serve as a conduit for this warrior, who spoke in elaborate, pre-Shakespearean English. Alan was unexpectedly chosen by the channel to embrace the spirit of the warrior, leading to a profound and transformative experience that he describes as unlike anything he had ever encountered before. Watts uses this anecdote to illustrate the limitations of rational thought in understanding deep aspects of consciousness, awareness, and the nature of reality. He argues that our critical faculties are useful for practical matters but are "lethal to understanding" beyond their scope. Watts encourages exploration of our true nature and intelligence beyond mere rationality, suggesting that we have the capacity for creative, mystical, and transcendent experiences if we allow ourselves to be open to them. He emphasizes the need for guidance and wisdom in navigating these deeper aspects of our being to avoid falling into madness while also avoiding the constraining effects of overly rigid rationality. Watts invites his audience to consider the possibility of broader, more encompassing experiences of consciousness and to seek out teachers and mentors who can guide them on this journey. He concludes with a hope that listeners will find paths that are beautiful, relationships that are loving, and dreams that are amazing.
