1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
hello everybody if I had realized that I might be motivated to make a

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,400
recording while I was out walking today I would have brought something to screen

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:24,200
the wind and usually a cotton ball or even some facial tissue wrapped around

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:31,120
the mic with a rubber band something like this it's enough it works it works

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,560
fine for my recording setup

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,840
yeah I'm not going to talk about that all right so what is on my mind first of

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:59,800
all I am where am I I am at a lake it is very windy and no shame for any of you

8
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,080
who decide this is too much wind noise for you but those of you who are bold

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:13,280
can accompany me in this strange adventure where I am risking my life

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:22,720
primarily from widowmaker tree falls to get a little exercise on Sunday in the

11
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:32,360
midst of some really interestingly stormy weather lots of wind gusts

12
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:47,000
occasional bouts of serious rain but not the long slow calm kind of rain that is

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,760
often well less threatening when the minute when the wind picks up the

14
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:07,000
primary threat seems to be trees falling and where I live there's a lot of sand

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,800
actually that's ridiculous let me be more clear as I understand it most of

16
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:30,160
Golden Gate Park is a giant sand dune with some complex aquifers underneath it

17
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:40,240
so I guess long ago the humans imported a bunch of topsoil so to speak and spread

18
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:53,480
it all around and one of my friends well actually no longer my friend what ex

19
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:02,000
communicated me for let's see I had a tiny bit of a sniffle and I was outside in

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,560
the gardens without a mask on or no I had a mask on actually but as I wasn't

21
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:23,960
severely quarantining I guess my friend decided I was a bad man turned out that

22
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:34,400
it was less than tiny allergies that I was experiencing not even a cold and I

23
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,640
certainly wasn't getting in anyone's face so yes she once remarked you know

24
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,120
there's so many non-native trees here and they just don't form deep roots and I

25
00:03:49,240 --> 00:04:05,480
thought I mean especially now it's very obvious to me that she having the status that we would

26
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:13,800
associate with a person of color particularly whose ancestry comes from India might have

27
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:24,680
been making a psychological right right a displacement or a projection in metaphor

28
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:31,720
without knowing it because what I saw we see a lot of trees fall here in fact I'm

29
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,600
looking at five or six that fell recently right now yeah there's a bunch of them wow

30
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:50,680
I mean it's you know it's literally dangerous to be out in weather this windy the secondary

31
00:04:50,680 --> 00:05:01,560
danger for pedestrians is stuff going in your eye or being impaled on your umbrella but anyway

32
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:16,040
back to the tree things so my friend who excommunicated me is a docent at the botanical

33
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:25,640
gardens I think still and I would be surprised if she did not understand that you're talking

34
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:32,920
about a maximum of two or three feet in most places of topsoil sometimes less and then just

35
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:47,880
saying right so when trees fall over I don't think it's because they're non-native right they fall

36
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:58,040
over they don't form complex root systems not because they're not native but because it's pretty

37
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:13,720
hard to do in sand right so yeah part of the it's funny part of the the trail here has been

38
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,000
cordoned off

39
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:28,760
yeah I guess there's also being hit in the head by things that fall that aren't branches for

40
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,360
example pine cones and stuff or little pieces of branches that could wipe you out as a human

41
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,160
it doesn't take a lot of weight coming from the sky you know 20 30 feet above your head

42
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:52,600
to hurt you or even kill you especially if you're not wearing a hard hat so yeah lots of risk

43
00:06:52,600 --> 00:07:04,520
what's the f side well a couple of things one who as one gets older you start to have to pick

44
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,680
more or less explicitly between something resembling

45
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,960
more adventure or something resembling more safety and the more safety line

46
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:27,160
is devastating in a bunch of ways because although you could handle maybe you could handle

47
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:34,680
box life um without too much trouble a while ago when you start getting older

48
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:43,080
the comfort of box life begins to become rattle into the comfort of the grave so to speak

49
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,760
metaphorically and so

50
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,140
so

51
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:59,320
one necessarily chooses and it's a choice that you make each day now it's similar with

52
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,960
our minds do we adventure or do we stay in familiar terrain

53
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:15,320
um and why and what what turns out to happen is it's a bit like exercise

54
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,920
if you don't if you don't keep it up

55
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,640
it tends to oh wow there's a little yeah see I just saw a branch fall that

56
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,680
could have definitely hurt someone thankfully it was um

57
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:46,680
slowish oh wow I just heard another one yeah it's like I'm out here and it's it's like I'm

58
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,200
hearing gunshots right except they're not gunshots they're tree breaks

59
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:01,320
so it's probably good that trail was cordoned off because I might have been stupid enough to go

60
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:13,000
up there and I can tell from here basically it's a bunch of cypress trees and these things naturally

61
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:24,680
produce um I think it's mostly cypress and they naturally produce these long slender branches

62
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:33,800
that are prone especially when water soaked to just snap off right it might be some kind of

63
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:40,600
you know evolutionary benefit or something maybe maybe those branches both fertilize the ground as

64
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:49,720
they as they fall apart or um bring other organisms or root possibly or maybe there's no

65
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:58,520
you know obvious benefit if we're doing what we might imagine is Darwinian accounting

66
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:12,840
which brings me to a variety of topics I've long held to switch to the topic of house cats

67
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:20,840
that house cats are basically they can be understood from a variety of interesting perspectives

68
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:29,080
including that they are effectively ambient psychedelic organisms meaning that if you begin

69
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:38,840
to bond your mind with the mind of a provocatively intelligent house cat rather than a really lazy

70
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,520
one but even the lazy ones or it's like they're smoking opium or something all the time um

71
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:55,560
or rather they don't need to smoke anything uh the Cheshire cat in Alice in Wonderland is sort of an

72
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:10,280
example of someone who has noticed the strangeness of the cats but I have long held that um

73
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:22,040
in terms of intelligence and non-human intelligence and alien like not alien is in bad alien is in

74
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:35,240
family member from another origin right more like that um yeah the house cats those are

75
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,040
like the square root of an octopus is a house cat you know

76
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:51,000
and maybe if you you know house cat to the second or third power equals praying mantis or

77
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:59,720
something like this and you know you can flip it around um the the the intelligence of the

78
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:10,040
ambush predators is very unique and profound um and the intelligence of a house cat which is a

79
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:18,120
really peculiar an animal with a very peculiar history um developmental history very peculiar

80
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:28,680
and trippy because it goes from being a wild alpha predator to being a half domesticated

81
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:38,200
beta like you know delta predator or something that effectively causes its primary symbiont

82
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:52,520
right um captures a food source in humans trippy right very strange very unexpected um from some

83
00:12:52,520 --> 00:13:07,800
perspectives now of course the natural contrast to a house cat is the dog um similar similar

84
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:21,560
developmental history uh and look um cats aren't not pack animals they just uh you

85
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:35,800
know lions at least um have what we call prides in english groups and are there other

86
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:46,200
examples i don't know there are probably examples of couplings and friendships but not

87
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,840
primary necessary groups i just don't know enough about the feeling animals to know

88
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:02,760
but there's at least one example of uh where they form you know cohorts and pods

89
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:13,720
and i imagine young lions and perhaps mountain lions and so forth may certainly when they're young

90
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:20,280
right they um travel and hunt and play with their siblings who knows if there's inter

91
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:31,720
interfamily activity of that kind i was talking to my friend uh jay the other night

92
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:40,520
actually was last night and we were talking about this this topic and i love to wax uh

93
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:47,880
enthusiastic about the intelligences of the ambush predators because they are in a sense

94
00:14:48,040 --> 00:15:05,560
like if you want security and um familiarity dogs work beautifully right those are the solar

95
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:12,440
animal essentially of the pair and look there are solar cats and there are lunar dogs but

96
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:25,080
fundamentally um the dog is the solar animal uh daytime predator right um although not entirely

97
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:33,160
you got coyotes and wolves that are nocturnal um maybe i had that wrong actually uh nighttime

98
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:40,680
predator nocturnal and similarly cats also nocturnal but perhaps more so than dogs

99
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,400
um tend to sleep all day stay up all night left to their own devices probably

100
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,160
i don't know what they would do in their natural situations because i don't see those

101
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,320
animals in those situations but i do think of dogs as solar

102
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,160
not explicitly and not only and cats as

103
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,640
though now there's going to be some serious wind

104
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:19,240
so we were talking about this the other night and okay what was the topic all right the topic

105
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,520
was actually pretty deep it was

106
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:36,280
a topic that i've spoken of some recently but even since then the insight has been enriched

107
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:44,200
it's the topic of what happens when something captures the nervous system of an animal

108
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,440
and there's lots of stuff that capture our nervous system

109
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:58,920
um a simple example of this is that you know it's the pavlovian thing right if we smell

110
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,680
something delicious in fact i'm just i'm merely thinking of something delicious and my mouth is

111
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:14,040
starting to water but if i smell something delicious much more so so that's an example where

112
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:26,600
where you can see that i have no control i have no mental control over

113
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,160
so

114
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,160
gale force winds just short of hurricane speed

115
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,320
i have no control over whether my mouth waters or not that i know of

116
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,760
of might be able to influence it with nlp or hypnosis or something but i have no

117
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:06,280
my salvation and similarly if i hear one of those gunshot branch cracks and it's loud

118
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,440
enough and near enough probably y'all jump

119
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,000
when you see corvids at least around here

120
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,760
approaching food on the ground

121
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:36,520
they will often sort of hop toward it and leap backwards

122
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,880
i was thinking a lot about that particular behavior the other day after observing it because

123
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,360
trying to understand

124
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,640
one thing i can imagine now which it didn't occur to me before

125
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:04,680
i mean it's not crazy it's natural it's just different from the very safe norm

126
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,920
that usually applies and the difference is profound enough that i am well aware i could

127
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:17,640
be killed it's not very likely but it's probably 50 times more likely than it was yesterday

128
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,160
all right so

129
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,240
the thing that occurs to me now and i couldn't figure it out before but now it seems relatively

130
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:38,760
obvious snakes eat birds and one of the best ways to catch bird

131
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:46,360
would be to hang out near the corpse of an animal right

132
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:55,640
you're an ambush predator you have that that feline intelligence that praying mantis intelligence

133
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:02,200
that octopus intelligence the jumping spider intelligence right you have this

134
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:11,480
trap setting capable capable of setting a trap intelligence praying mantis is straight

135
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:20,200
upset traps on flowers right just no doubt about it you see them do it all the time

136
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,240
so i wouldn't ambush predators

137
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,120
and since corvids eat meat

138
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,800
they eat other stuff too they eat seeds and bugs and worms and stuff it depends on the birds and where they are

139
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,360
since they eat meat

140
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:56,520
what might happen is a snake might or other ambush predator possibly not sure what a bobcat maybe

141
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:04,920
what else would eat birds i don't think i mean coyotes eat birds but they also eat dead things

142
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:12,600
snakes don't usually i don't know of any snakes that eat corpses

143
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:23,800
now you can teach cage snakes to eat dead mice i don't know if they eat dead mice in the wild

144
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:30,440
not clear to me it seems pragmatically effective that they should i just don't know

145
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:43,000
but yeah i can imagine snake hangs out near bird food of any kind right dead things seed piles you

146
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:53,320
name it and just waits for birds and waits close enough that when the bird gets to the food item

147
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,920
it's within striking distance of the snake so that would explain

148
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:10,120
evolutionarily how the peck jumped back like it's literally like that that

149
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:19,080
that song that has the lyrics jump back jack in it the bird like goes forward and then leaves

150
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:25,240
backward it may do that a few times and after like two or three times it'll it may just fly

151
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,160
off and leave the food alone that does happen i've seen it but what's going on there isn't that the

152
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:38,600
bird is thinking i'm scared i think what's going on is that the bird's nervous system has been

153
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:48,280
captured by something like an evolutionarily developed and look the thing may not be genetic

154
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:56,760
there's got to be nine other ways of influencing organisms that aren't merely genes and most of

155
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,760
those ways might we would argue would would necessarily have some effect on genomes because

156
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:09,000
they they become selection variables in that theory and we're going to get some weird stuff

157
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,520
about that in a minute um so they might have they might have selective

158
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,920
functions so to speak or effect

159
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,920
but yeah what i think is going on is that the organism's nervous system has been captured

160
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:34,280
and like a goose that sees a ball rolled a few feet from its nest during a certain season

161
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:40,280
and it will go the goose will crane its neck at least this is what i've heard

162
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:46,520
crane its neck from research crane its neck go toward the ball and roll the ball back into

163
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,200
the nest whether or not there's a ball there anymore at all and you know whether or not it

164
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,360
much resembles an egg so you can see that

165
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:08,760
there are these protocols you know in the age of computers we would be likely to call them programs

166
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,560
because we're just reaching around for some metaphor but it's a

167
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:20,600
historically physically structured vulnerability to capture

168
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,800
when an organism detects high heat suddenly it recoils

169
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:37,160
it may recoil from other things water food that may not be safe or smells wrong

170
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,920
um you know one kid on the bus uh disgorges his breakfast on the floor

171
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:52,600
now you pretty soon have what a oh this could be good just siren

172
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,960
we might get a demonstration of this effect let's see

173
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:08,040
uh yeah pretty soon you've got you know

174
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:20,520
sudden unexpected public vomitorium on the bus right because once two more kids

175
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:26,520
follow suit and they're certainly not doing that on purpose right they're not trying to do that

176
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,080
they don't want to do that they can't help it

177
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,560
so uh

178
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,920
we didn't get the example i wanted so um

179
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,440
you can see that there's a structured response

180
00:25:52,680 --> 00:26:00,920
um that's probably ordinarily rather than being activated

181
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,960
we can think of it both ways and we probably should

182
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:13,560
rather than being activated by stimuli it could also just be ordinarily inhibited

183
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,920
and under some circumstances that inhibition collapses and the coyote howls

184
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,240
in concert with the approach of a siren not because it wants to

185
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:34,280
not because i mean possibly it's in pain it is possible we don't know and it's reasonable to

186
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:48,520
imagine it might be um when you present uh wildly exaggerated stimuli to an extremely sensitive

187
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,320
organisms

188
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:07,960
to a hypersensitive organism right if a wasp can detect one molecule of a substance within

189
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:14,040
a two-mile range within a two-mile circle as i understand it some wasps are capable of that

190
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:20,760
degree of sensitivity if you subject them to for example

191
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,600
some kind of human perfume laundry soap for example laundry soap stench

192
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:37,880
could be physically painful to them so we don't know whether the siren is physically painful

193
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,720
but we do know that it resembles other coyotes calling

194
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:52,520
and so when the dogs howl in the coyotes um howl at the siren there's a good chance that

195
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:59,000
they're just being triggered right their body is howling not their mind and

196
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:09,560
um you know we hear people talk about sensory experiences like the hair stood up on the back

197
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:16,760
of my neck um i got goosebumps and obviously goosebumps are a thing that happens when we're

198
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:26,920
cold too but uh there are certain physiological transformations uh heart palpitates right we

199
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:33,160
like i don't know if we like it i think we like it because we're our most of our experience is

200
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:43,480
kind of deadened but we like horror movies sometimes or we may like um scary rides because they

201
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:53,080
deprive us of the control we might ordinarily have over our body's sensations

202
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,800
or the selection of sensations right actively selecting sensations

203
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:10,040
um and subject us to extraordinary forces and sensations

204
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,440
so we too can be triggered

205
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:24,680
um it would be interesting to see the library of programs so to speak they're not actually

206
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:31,560
programs i don't think but to see like the library of a single creature now obviously if you

207
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,760
observe a single creature very closely over time and you observe many of them many of their kind

208
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:49,000
quote unquote you will begin to understand something of the library uh so praying mantises for example

209
00:29:49,000 --> 00:30:01,640
will they have a complex striking uh behavior it's a pray capture behavior but they can use

210
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:09,720
it like a punch as well and they have a complex uh threat display where their body transforms

211
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:21,240
you know into a creature oriented to both fight and shock uh a possibly predatory animal creature

212
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:35,320
so we were talking about the peculiarities obviously right like social media is weaponizing

213
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:47,160
this against us it one could say it is studying in a sense human activity and then producing

214
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:58,280
hopeful monsters that capture it amplify it um and make it contagious that's one of the dumbest

215
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:05,240
uses of technology that anyone could imagine i mean it's almost as dumb as just throwing bricks

216
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:13,320
at people's heads the problem here is that they can't see the brick right it has the same effect

217
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:19,320
in that they get dumber every time they're subjected to it most of them some of them

218
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,560
have a good buffer some of the humans um but yeah they get dumber every time like

219
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,880
every iteration makes them dumber and

220
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:43,880
the problem there is really dangerous because anything that reduces your awareness or sensitivity

221
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:55,720
over time is prone to create a situation where you can't you won't be able to perceive what you've

222
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:03,720
lost and this is part of the problem with ordinary human aging one might argue that social media

223
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:11,560
ages certain aspects of us um precipitously and invisibly

224
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,440
since our bodies don't age in response though i think actually internally they do we don't notice

225
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,760
anything that affects the thing you notice with right creates a really good

226
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:39,400
a really effective process that hides its own it hides its own progress and it hides the damage it

227
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:50,600
does it naturally does this so we want to have awareness when we approach technologies or media

228
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:02,600
we want to have awareness of what's getting compromised how quickly how deeply

229
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:11,160
and how can we if it if it becomes necessary for some reason that we interact with the technology

230
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:18,680
anyway or if we want to we want to have the intelligence necessary to make determinations

231
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:29,480
about what that curve of harm looks like to whatever degree we are able and then adjust

232
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,920
our behavior accordingly so as to preserve the assets that would otherwise be lost

233
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:48,200
now you can see that the pros for example when they approach a food source on the ground

234
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:59,240
start to go at it and then jump back they're testing to see if anything moves nearby the food

235
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,400
during that process and if it does they will become aware that the food is a trap

236
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:18,360
now obviously also once humans became tool makers of some kind they probably made bird traps too

237
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:27,800
of various kinds and so the bird is trying to check whether you know probably a

238
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,760
whether there's a organismal trap and b whether there's a physical trap even though it may not

239
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,440
its body probably isn't a complexly differentiating between those two things

240
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:48,440
all right so triggering

241
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:04,840
I think even likely for an organism to take advantage of programs that are normally

242
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,760
let's not call them programs let's call them abilities

243
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,680
for or what do I want to call them

244
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,920
abilities

245
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,800
each organism seems to uniquely develop

246
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:31,960
of

247
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,280
yeah this is this starts to run into problems between the difference between language and

248
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,400
description and what animals and organisms actually are and are doing are being

249
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:59,960
so imagine a broad spectrum of unique forms of sensitivity and or intelligence

250
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:13,240
that naturally result in super effective like meta effective

251
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,360
relational or physical

252
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,760
skills one can imagine that it might be possible for an organism to

253
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,880
especially for humans for example because we have a lot we have a great deal of luxury

254
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:38,680
compared to most animals in consciously determining our developmental spectrum spectra

255
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:51,480
so the humans we probably have access to

256
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,640
to at least probably thousands of potentially developable

257
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:06,280
abilities that result when enacted in something resembling either relational or physical

258
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:13,000
super function or both and one tends to lead to the other right because for example

259
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:21,000
brilliant athletes who become known for their athleticism

260
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:32,360
acquire relational benefits what we call fame which radically increases both there

261
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,640
the opportunity space for reproduction but also for just enjoyment

262
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:47,640
unfortunately at the same time because of how strange the humans are in modernity and maybe forever

263
00:37:49,720 --> 00:38:00,040
that will also attract enemies opponents undesirable possibly obsessive attention from other humans

264
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,280
and maybe under some circumstances from the sky itself

265
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:18,760
so my friend and I were talking about cats and she said something resembling you know

266
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
well i was talking about how cats can be triggered right if they and that sometimes house cats

267
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:38,040
dogs you can see dogs doing behaviors displaying behaviors that and i guess i'm anthropomorphizing

268
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,640
bit that may be natural for humans or at least some humans

269
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:50,200
you know when a dog makes a silly mistake a silly physical mistake or like

270
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:58,760
it misses the bite or it slides chasing the ball it crashes into the wall or

271
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,040
and by the way that's you can see triggering right there because the dog ordinarily does

272
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,080
not crash into things but under circumstances where it becomes hyper focused on the ball

273
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:16,120
it will crash in many dogs will just crash into walls or other nearby objects

274
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:23,320
so

275
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:37,400
i have seen okay we're in gale force winskin dogs appear to exhibit emotions that resemble shame

276
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:45,080
and or embarrassment i'm granting that that's my interpretation

277
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,080
after cert after being witnessed

278
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,080
they seem to be aware of observation in a way not dissimilar to how we are

279
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:04,600
if i suddenly step on the side of my foot for example and begin to stumble because i missed

280
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:11,880
step the first problem is the pain in my ankle but the second problem is did anybody see me

281
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:18,920
you know i will quickly glance around to see if i have been seen to have failed at something

282
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:29,960
as simple as taking a step right so i was i was explaining that it was my experience when i began

283
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:37,080
to learn more about cats because my girlfriend had a pair and certainly i encountered them many

284
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:42,360
times before but i think this pair of cats was the pair i was most intimate with him

285
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:54,760
throughout my life to memorialize them mexicat and panther which who was her son

286
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:05,880
mexicat was a very hyper intelligent sensitive loving soft mother cat very fluffy furry white

287
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,240
found in the desert with a piece of her tail missing as a kitten i think if i remember right

288
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,040
and panther was one of her children big black fluffy

289
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:26,040
cat and panther would when we were playing occasionally and i've seen other cats do this

290
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:36,280
very few of them won't be triggered if you accept the gambit so this is this is a gambit in animal

291
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:47,400
chess called cat belly when dogs give you their belly it may or may not be submissive but it's

292
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:56,120
they're they're showing their vulnerability because their primary powers as an animal

293
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:01,080
are

294
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:12,520
the primary powers are like a spear in a dog they lunge and penetrate

295
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:25,400
the cat is different it can lunge but it normally attacks with paws because those are razor sharp

296
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:32,600
and grippy and once it gets a grip then it can penetrate usually the neck of a creature often

297
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:41,640
the neck with jaws both animals have bone breaking jaw power the cats is less because it's smaller

298
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:49,720
the house cat anyway um but what what she was saying i was saying that basically sometimes

299
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:58,120
i would pet panther and he would you know roll over on his back and this seemed to be an invitation

300
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:07,240
for you know some gentle aware belly petting um gentle and aware both because you know this is

301
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:16,680
an animal's vulnerable underside and previous experience had taught me that under certain conditions

302
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:25,400
cats become triggered and when they are triggered they may bite unintentionally

303
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:32,920
and usually they can manage the force so that it's not really bad it's still painful

304
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:41,400
and they also can there's some word for this it's not worry that's what a dog does it's

305
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:50,040
some kind of shredding thing they basically um grasp with their front paws and may claw with them

306
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:57,080
and then shred or gash with their rear paws and so what would happen is i'd be petting panther

307
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:05,720
we'd be having like a love session and you know he really he really enjoys that but then sometimes

308
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:12,680
he would get triggered and capture my hand bite it and try to rip at it with his back claws and then

309
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:26,440
he would he would sort of snap out of it and display signs of that i interpreted as sadness

310
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:37,160
shame embarrassment i didn't mean to do that this kind of thing and uh it took me a long time to

311
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:46,360
understand what was going on i certainly didn't understand to the degree that i you know in any

312
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:53,080
thing that resembles what i'm saying now i was unconsciously aware but not cognitively and

313
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:59,800
conceptually aware of what was going on i didn't have a model but i did learn very quickly that

314
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:07,720
when cats show you their belly it's either one of two things usually going on either they really

315
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:15,720
will enjoy the intimacy and danger of allowing it effectively a god right an animal that is

316
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:21,160
unimaginably powerful full compared to you um you can kill a cat probably just by crushing

317
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:28,520
its rib cage in your single in the grip of one hand right you can kill it if you wanted to kill

318
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:35,160
a cat hopefully you don't um it would take very little effort on your part to destroy the animal

319
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,600
physically and there's very little the cat could do about it so and the cat may not know your

320
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:50,200
physical strength but it probably suspects it from examining you so when the cat rolls over either

321
00:45:51,400 --> 00:46:01,160
um it has learned to inhibit the triggering that is likely to happen when you approach

322
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:09,960
its belly with your hand and begin stroking it um and so it just enjoys the ecstatic feeling

323
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:19,640
of being vulnerable like being loved where one is most vulnerable so to speak

324
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:27,320
in human language um but other cats and again look the cat rolls over and displays its belly

325
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:33,480
so something's going on there but it's not necessarily my friend was saying a display of

326
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:45,240
submission or you know because when the cat is on its back all 20 of its face knife footraisers

327
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,160
are accessible and the bite and so now

328
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,400
it can grip with its fore paws bite

329
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,960
and shred with its hind legs

330
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:17,400
and this is a for for many animals I suspect this is a disemboweling move right it opens up

331
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,280
first of all just opens up gashes on the animal if you're a large cat

332
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,400
if you're a small cat it still messes them up

333
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:34,040
so yeah we had a big laugh because she was like the cat rolls over and people think it's a submission

334
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:39,960
move because they've been watching dogs or something it may or may not be partly submissive

335
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:45,480
but basically the cat now has full access to all of its weapons

336
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,400
it's almost like the cat is saying like the cat is daring you

337
00:47:54,360 --> 00:48:02,520
right do you want to put your hand in the chainsaw

338
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,320
it's like a Tasmanian devil in loony tunes I just rips things apart

339
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,800
so I thought that was hilarious hilarious take on

340
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,040
cats but if you want non-ordinary experience

341
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:30,040
if you're someone who seeks that the best place to seek it is in

342
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:38,600
devoted contact with the living place with specific animals and birds

343
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:46,200
you know it doesn't matter whether plants have spirits or plants have minds

344
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,720
they are organisms and we are organisms and we are organisms from the same world

345
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:59,080
so in one set of categories that makes us the same thing the same being

346
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:07,080
we are that that tree is me outside my body I am the tree outside its trunk

347
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:17,000
and I'm not saying this is a fact but it is categorically true before even we are organisms

348
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:26,680
we are beings so it goes like the concentric circles go like mystery universe then beings

349
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:34,200
and organisms and earth organisms and then you know on down the line to animals human animals

350
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:42,200
and that's just what if what if our category tree is missing three important elements and I would

351
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:54,200
argue it is so that we can't even see them in language there's no way to detect them in concepts

352
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:00,200
because we have no placeholder for them in our categorical libraries

353
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:07,560
and I think actually this is a huge problem for all humans

354
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,280
but particularly for we who speak English because our category tree

355
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:26,680
is it's almost like it was hit by a shotgun or something it's missing big chunks of crucially

356
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:38,440
important placeholders shelves containers so forth that would draw our attention to

357
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:48,040
modes of existence that we no longer have a placeholder for and so since we don't most of those modes

358
00:50:48,040 --> 00:51:01,240
get they get exported to the supernatural the psychic the superstitious the religious but

359
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:08,840
they shouldn't they don't need to be the actual situation is so weird that it's weirder than all

360
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:15,720
of supernatural speculation it's weirder than all religious speculation it's weirder than all of science

361
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:25,320
so none of those should become the authorities of identity those are conceptual frameworks

362
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:35,080
right you might argue one might reasonably argue that humans are particularly vulnerable

363
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:48,120
to structured reactions that are not necessarily physical but are similarly involuntary and our

364
00:51:48,120 --> 00:52:02,120
conceptual right what would be an example well weirdly I was listening to the most enlightening

365
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:10,280
podcast last night on I think a philosopher called Dugan that it is in thought that it is

366
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:20,760
thought or Durgan that it is thought influenced influences Putin's policy dramatically

367
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:29,880
and for the first time I heard

368
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:38,840
powerful criticisms of the concept of liberal being liberal

369
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,320
so yes where was I going all right

370
00:52:51,640 --> 00:53:00,920
examples of such cognitive traps are the Christian belief that everybody who doesn't accept Jesus

371
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:16,680
is going to hell and that there's a Satan now similarly the doctrinal liberal belief

372
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:28,040
once it becomes doctrine once you have to either be liberal or fascist the liberal belief that

373
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:38,120
you get to invent your identity you get to invent your gender you are free to completely dispose

374
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:45,160
of all conventions and anyone who doesn't dispose of these conventions is evil

375
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,280
particularly if they do not dispose of them in the way that you dispose of them

376
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:59,480
now you have sectarian liberality right and this can become extremely dangerous virulent

377
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,400
and compelling for humans we

378
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:15,720
adopt programs from not tradition but traditional language and the traditional

379
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:21,960
presuppositions about identity meaning and value also which games are played

380
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:33,960
that are imported when we learn a modern language particularly in my case I can speak

381
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,440
only telling me about English okay

382
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,960
hmm so

383
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,400
wow that's interesting

384
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:01,160
I've walked around the lake I think I'm on my third circuit

385
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:06,920
I'm sure you heard that sound that sound was the sound of a spear

386
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:15,320
falling from a cypress into the ground a foot from me it was pointed straight down

387
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:23,560
it was pointy on the end it stuck into the ground and it had a cone on it it was small but

388
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:31,960
had I been struck by that likely I'd have been injured possibly seriously

389
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:40,760
so it's probably time to stop the adventure but I'm not going to just yet

390
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:48,040
because the sun has come back out and there's a break in the rain and it's a good time to

391
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:55,000
stretch my legs I think of course I could walk in safer places

392
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,520
um

393
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,760
that startled me so I branched in thought

394
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,840
yes so the humans are vulnerable okay when we learn a language like English a bunch of

395
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:18,280
games are imported like courtroom mind or war mine or mine and yours or us and them

396
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,280
now us and them exist in most languages and conceptual frameworks

397
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:28,440
uh but the way the particular character of the English the modern the colonial

398
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,800
the neocolonial the pericolonial

399
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:41,960
you know what that is it's probably crashing crashing trees it's tree branches snapping yeah

400
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:49,160
scary yeah be careful uh there I've seen branches fall on the path it's very very windy

401
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:55,640
they can kill you I'm not saying don't walk I'm out here walking too but just be aware because

402
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:05,400
it is yeah yeah but I almost got hit a moment ago by like a spear that's stuck in the ground

403
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:11,400
and it was like a foot from me so be you know be aware those those cypresses they naturally

404
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:21,560
drop large branches so on that side you're at risk around this side not so much yeah okay my pleasure

405
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:37,400
yeah there were some gunshot branch cracks

406
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:56,600
all right I keep getting distracted but thanks for bearing with me those of you who have hopefully

407
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:03,160
I'll give you some uh some juicy morsels here um all right so

408
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,300
so

409
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:14,440
complex array of what I would call malware comes packaged with English and it's not

410
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,520
actually it's not in the language

411
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,200
per se the malware isn't necessarily in the language

412
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:38,520
the malware is packaged in metaphors models of identity meaning value relation function

413
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,320
um

414
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:57,160
efficacy and basically good and evil that come from the cultural or anti-cultural right the malware

415
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,560
traditions that

416
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:14,360
influenced how we tend to utilize the language together particularly today and over say the

417
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:22,920
past two three hundred years um the malware package that's attached to languages evolves

418
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,760
over time along with the language it's not clear that the languages contain malware rather it's

419
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:38,680
the suppositions underlying their deployment and particularly their deployment um beyond

420
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:47,240
the personal like the person-to-person environment in the larger social and

421
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:53,880
and disease riddled you know um cultural

422
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,680
dumpster fire that is you know modernity

423
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,600
back into the gusty winds but not too dangerous here

424
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,840
so there's no trees likely to drop a branch on me near me

425
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,720
all right so

426
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:32,760
recently I've been listening to people like David Berlinsky and actually there's a primary

427
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:37,800
author whose name I can't remember but also

428
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:47,640
um a man whose name I'm going to mispronounce David Gilertner and if you want to find one of the

429
01:00:47,640 --> 01:01:04,440
things I listen to um just search on mathematics and Darwin and okay so Darwin's book was called

430
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:12,520
The Origin of Species it is by it is you know he was the Einstein in a sense of biology

431
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:25,320
in that he gave us a map that appeared to be valid and explanatory for a broad range of

432
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:33,480
uh observable phenomena um and doctrinally

433
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:48,360
it is canon to oppose it in any way is to earn broad denigration attack insult

434
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:55,880
and this is unfortunate because science should never be about doctrine

435
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:03,960
science should be about discovery and logical rational thought

436
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:11,320
it should not cater to biases or presuppositions in fact it shouldn't cater to anything

437
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:19,080
but the facts and an ever-improving description of the relationships between them that we observe

438
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,680
obviously this involves explanatory manifolds

439
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,760
so intuition and suppositions about identity function

440
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:36,920
distinction and and you know the scientific method is fundamentally dissective

441
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,320
so it tends to break things down into parts and then examine relationships

442
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,920
that by itself can be an error but um

443
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:57,560
nearly every biologist believes well maybe that's not true many many modern biologists believe that

444
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:10,040
that the book entitled the origin of species

445
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:15,960
does in fact tell us how species arose

446
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:25,240
and so is generally accepted as an origin of life argument tells us how we got species from

447
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:34,600
the origin you know organisms now it doesn't make any I don't I don't actually know the

448
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:42,600
book well my doubt explains about origin of life because that's still quite mysterious

449
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:49,640
even though the mechanical physicalist

450
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:57,960
eliminative materialist version is either soup you got a complex soup on earth that

451
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:06,840
eventually produced cells or you know RNA and then there's some you know leap from RNA

452
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:15,400
to cells and DNA and bacteria and protists and archaea and so forth

453
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,480
but nobody knows how you get from chemistry to life

454
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:31,560
there are precisely zero successful models of this

455
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:39,800
uh lots of people have speculations some of those speculation the belief is generally

456
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:47,240
and what is taught is that life is the mechanical result of the combination of chemicals

457
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,840
and forces on earth

458
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,200
um

459
01:04:54,520 --> 01:05:03,640
and a number of scientists who are not trying to import god into biology

460
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:14,280
are making the claim for intelligent design by falsifying something resembling

461
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,320
Darwin's blind watchmaker claim

462
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:27,720
i.e okay so the one of the old proofs of the existence of god was the unimaginable complexity

463
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:36,440
of organisms now our human experience of that complexity and our cognition about it has changed

464
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:40,360
quite a bit over many years

465
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:47,560
particularly since Darwin and has been influenced by a bunch of doctrinal garbage

466
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:53,000
that really has nothing to do with it but a long time ago someone possibly bacon

467
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,800
argued maybe it was Francis Bacon i don't i can't remember

468
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:03,480
argued that the existence of organisms proves the existence of god because

469
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:13,480
if you were walking along a if you were walking along a path in the forest

470
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,600
and you look down and you saw for example

471
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:25,560
i'm going to use a sort of weird example um a colander

472
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,160
right

473
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,640
uh or a knife

474
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:39,080
i'm using a very simple physical object a knife you would not presume

475
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,800
be very unlikely for you to presume that the knife had been produced by the accidental combination

476
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,800
of substance and forces

477
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:52,040
there are certain kinds of objects

478
01:06:53,880 --> 01:07:00,040
that naturally to our intuition imply a mind was involved in creating them

479
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:11,800
and fundamentally these objects can be said and in some cases blatantly obviously do

480
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,160
they can be said to encode information

481
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,000
so for example

482
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:30,120
dna is a digital data storage and propagation machine if we think in those terms i don't

483
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:36,200
but i'll use the language common to biologists of my day they tend to think as the they think

484
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:41,720
they think of cells and organisms as machines which i think is hilarious i get what they mean

485
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:49,160
um they don't mean diesel engine they mean

486
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:57,720
a structured process that causes the transformation combination and distinction

487
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,040
of various substances and structures over time

488
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:08,440
i mean something resembling that

489
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:17,000
i don't think of them as machines but we'll use the language so where was i the machines

490
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,360
there are precise precisely zero

491
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,480
instances we know of

492
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:33,560
of where complex ordered information was produced without a mind

493
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,160
the biologists are presuming

494
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:49,880
unjustifiably that the cell is such an arrangement there is no evidence for that in fact

495
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,640
if we do the math these scientists argue

496
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:59,800
um i think one of the guys wrote a book that might be called darwin's delusion

497
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
and by the way what they're saying is effectively this

498
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:13,000
darwin got the theory right for downstream transformations of genomes mutations

499
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:21,720
changing parts of an animal from you know a bat wing to a bird wing or something

500
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:30,440
right um mutations that don't wipe out the organism and we'll get to an interesting feature

501
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:43,400
of that in a minute so the the scientists that are questioning this and look we don't have any

502
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:51,240
good arguments for origin of life panspermia is a change of arena right that's a rhetorical fallacy

503
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:58,600
you just move the you move the question elsewhere without supplying any useful further information

504
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:08,280
about it right um because you have the same problem with panspermia that you have with

505
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:14,040
origin of life on earth if life traveled here from elsewhere it had to begin somehow

506
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:20,440
and so it either began on a planet like ours or it began in an interstellar space or

507
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:26,840
it began somewhere maybe something we don't even understand you know again

508
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,640
the origin of life could be so profound that the concepts we presently rely on

509
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,880
uh

510
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,360
are insufficient

511
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:49,960
all right um though the scientists rarely argue this

512
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:58,840
so what they're saying so first of all we have no good explanation for the origin of life

513
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:07,240
many biologists believe that it's essentially a mechanical accident there's no evidence for

514
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:13,960
the involvement of an intelligence uh the east scientists believe that there's no evidence for

515
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:24,040
the accident in fact they cite mathematical analyses of for example the probability of

516
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,880
accidentally producing what

517
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,360
a useful protein i think is the example they gave

518
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:51,240
i can't recall if they were examining for you know an amino acid or what specific

519
01:11:51,320 --> 01:12:00,120
um biochemical element they were they were speaking of but i think what they said

520
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:08,600
is that the chances of producing a useful protein by accident okay the search space is

521
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:16,680
something like one in ten to the seventy and that's just one protein we're not talking about

522
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:23,720
you accidentally produced an organism um that resembles the probability of being able to locate

523
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:34,280
a single point particle say uh proton single proton in a search space nine like as large as

524
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:41,160
nine of our universe as we presently understand it the chances of you might as well call it

525
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:46,120
imp or linsky says if you want to say it's impossible i'm on your side if you want to say

526
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:51,160
it's improbable i'm on your side but let's be clear it's monumentally probable

527
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:59,640
and you know something i've argued for probably almost 20 years is that the complexity of the cell

528
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:06,120
radically defies anything any explanation that the humans can come up with at all

529
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:12,040
and this has turned out to be prophetic in that every 10 years or so

530
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:20,520
the complex as the complexity as the apparent complexity of the cell expands

531
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:30,680
for our science perhaps sometimes geometrically the possibility of explaining it recedes with every

532
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:38,280
expansion um and it recedes at a similar pace right it's like you thought you knew what was

533
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:45,000
going on you now found out there were 10 trillion variables you weren't including your chance of

534
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:59,080
explaining that mostly just disappears into infinity you know in my perspective uh i think our

535
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:09,240
physical theories are insufficient to explain biological phenomena and their origins and their

536
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:19,480
meanings and almost certainly their purposes which of which reproduction is not you know in the

537
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:37,080
physicalist lexicon that's the crucial thing to do but there's probably 900 other things they're

538
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:45,720
doing and there's certainly 15 of those that are nothing like what we suppose if you actually observe

539
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:51,480
organisms with an open mind you're going to discover something that generally defies description

540
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:58,840
it's not there for description for the purpose of humans describing it there's nothing to do

541
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:09,480
okay what the heck is this it's an artificial rock i don't understand oh i see it's a rat trap

542
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:18,680
wow it's a rat trap that looks like a rock wow humans are crazy

543
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:26,760
hmm i think i should visit my friend the tree

544
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:30,040
so

545
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:45,240
the scientists are in question here are very upset that textbook biology and the

546
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:58,200
the broad scale supposition of mechanical accident his origin for life a proposition for which not

547
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:11,640
only is there no evidence or nearly none um if we run some of the analytic math so that we come to

548
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:21,000
understand what the actual probabilities we we should be looking at are at this phase in our

549
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:33,720
understanding the math points in the direction that unless unless something really strange here

550
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:42,680
happened unless you hit the lottery you know unless you won the lottery 9 000 times in a row

551
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:51,880
like you you won almost every time you played there's no chance of producing not not never mind

552
01:16:51,880 --> 01:17:02,360
organisms just RNA DNA the complex protein synthesis apparatus of cells all of these things

553
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:10,920
or not no chance but an unimaginably almost infinitely unimaginably small chance literally

554
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:18,680
you know zero with a bit you know i don't know 5 000 decimal points after it and then a one

555
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:29,640
so uh i looked up the author um

556
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:38,040
although perhaps burlinski has collaborated with him stefan mire they have some essays and books

557
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:47,560
the deniable darwin darwin's doubt and i suspect they also make arguments that darwin himself doubted

558
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:53,800
that his theory was any explanation for the emergence of organisms on earth or

559
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:58,200
for the poorly defined idea of species

560
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:11,080
so it turns out that the origin of life arguments that are doctrinal are mostly nonsense

561
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:19,160
uh it's not that they're that it's entirely impossible that the emergence of life on earth

562
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:28,280
was a purely mechanical accident it's we have the actual problem you know minus uh the supposition

563
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:36,040
of god in the original argument that if you find something finely articulated and what could be

564
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:42,760
more finely articulated than a blue j it makes i mean just at at the level of its cells

565
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:54,120
its 900 magnitudes of complexity beyond any machine we've ever built a single cell

566
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,180
so

567
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:03,160
staggers the the computational complexity of the entire history of humans doing math

568
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:15,240
and it does that over the temporal space of like 10 seconds or maybe even one and we're talking

569
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:20,760
a single cell so you have a cell either hyper structure like a blue j or a raccoon

570
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,840
you're looking at something that

571
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:35,480
is pure science fiction there's no chance of something that sophisticated and agentive

572
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:43,800
was produced by accident at least not in any way that we can presently propose

573
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:56,040
is when we find in nature extremely complex objects invariably they are the produce of

574
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:05,880
minds with zero known exceptions so it's it's sort of the opposite of the problem we have

575
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:15,880
with um sorry i'm getting battered by the weather um it's the opposite of the problem we have

576
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:22,520
with the technical probability of there being life on other planets technically

577
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:33,560
due to how statistics and probability function if you have only a single

578
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:44,680
example of something you have no chance of determining the probability therefore the

579
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:59,000
probability is stated as zero so until probabilistically according to how we use statistics and probability

580
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:07,240
um there is zero probability of life on other worlds because it's unknown you have no data

581
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:14,120
with no data you can't produce a probabilistic estimate there are other ways to estimate the

582
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:23,400
probability intuitively we are very unlikely to believe that in a universe as vast as ours

583
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:29,400
this is the only planet with life that life we would have to believe that life

584
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:36,440
cannot spread from solar system to solar system or that there are no mechanisms for that transfer

585
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:42,280
to take place because if there were especially if there were fast methods

586
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:55,480
um something possibly sheldrake's morphogenic fields might represent

587
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:05,240
a sort of layer in in the universe or in time space in which once you manage to get an organism

588
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:13,080
on one world somewhere in time it's now vastly easier to get it on another one

589
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:22,520
um i doubt any of these scientists are fans of sheldrake meaning burlinski,

590
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,280
alertner and mire

591
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:37,800
but what i'm what i'm getting at is it could be that there are features of the everything

592
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:49,000
and i prefer that term or really the every one thing way all nests there are features of the

593
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:58,440
grand unity that we don't know anything about and could easily i think could reasonably possibly

594
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:06,520
set up a network between planets where information is transferred either at incredible speed or

595
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:15,160
instantaneously there might be forms of fields capable of doing this but this is my argument not

596
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:24,920
there's um what is their argument so their argument is that if you take the entire biospace

597
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:33,000
of organisms that we believe have ever existed on earth this includes you know bacteria viruses

598
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,200
the whole thing everything that number is something like 10 to the 40

599
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:43,720
if you then

600
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:54,040
divide the search space 10 to the 70 by the number of chances you have to produce say one useful protein

601
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,680
you're left with i don't know 10 to the 30 or something

602
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:10,760
um which is effectively no chance it means that over the history of life on earth there wasn't

603
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:20,120
time to accidentally assemble a useful protein uh unless something was going on that we don't

604
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:31,720
understand right and this inclines them to believe that that the explanation of intentional

605
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:43,080
terraforming or biospace was vastly vastly more probable than this was a mechanical accident

606
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:49,400
you got some chemistry together you got some forces together

607
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:59,720
out pops organisms that make unimaginably complex proteins and you know rna dna mrna

608
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:08,280
all of these things right uh that stuff just pops up you know on a roulette wheel right you

609
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:19,880
just keep spinning the wheel long enough out comes archaea so yeah wildly unlikely

610
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:35,160
whatever darwin showed us it wasn't how species originated a really good grasp on

611
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,600
certain features of of biology

612
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:53,080
mutation selection all this but nothing for how species arise right how do you get a different

613
01:25:53,080 --> 01:26:04,600
animal from a prototype we don't know and it's very unlikely to be accidental so it turns out

614
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:14,280
there's another problem which is something like the incredible amount of wind and rain pounding

615
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:22,520
into my face at the moment no i'm kidding there's another problem with where the kinds of mutations

616
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:29,800
that would give you a different animal from a prototype animal have to happen early in

617
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:39,560
blastogenesis i might have that wrong but they have to happen fairly early

618
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:51,720
in the process of producing an organism from oocytes right from from egg and sperm and so forth

619
01:26:52,520 --> 01:27:02,360
um although uh the language is more complex than what i'm when i'm presenting here i'm not

620
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:09,960
sure a sperm is a i think there's a different word for the sperm uh so you have to produce

621
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:17,160
a mutation early in the process to get a different animal and if you produce mutations early in the

622
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:25,400
process what you get is a dead animal like if you make any mistake early in the process

623
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:33,080
it's invariably fatal so if you get an early mutation

624
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:44,680
they said like someone said it was probably um an alert I think he said you know you have like

625
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:52,120
19 tails or way too many organs that don't fit inside the animal or you leave out like it doesn't

626
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:59,080
make blood right something fundamental goes sideways and the only way to get different animals

627
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:08,280
that we know of that we can imagine is mutations early in the in the process of generating the animal

628
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:19,240
um again those mutations tend to be fatal so you can't use mutations early in the process

629
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:27,000
and late in the process later in the process doesn't produce different animals it produces

630
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:33,880
different traits so effectively if i understood their argument there's no space

631
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:41,480
in the developmental arc of an organism that we can understand

632
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:51,160
that would allow a mutation to produce a new animal so how do you get stuff like the Cambrian

633
01:28:51,160 --> 01:29:03,160
explosion it looks like on earth we have something rather than um gradual meticulous evolution of

634
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:14,920
animals which i think was long held to be the likely case we have sudden like pulses

635
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:27,240
of unexpected diversification blossoming of myriad species myriad different organisms

636
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:40,760
and that certainly isn't explained by anything we have no idea how you get i mean i have some

637
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:50,200
propositions about this i would argue that um it's probably it could be helpful very helpful

638
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:59,560
to look at the organisms of earth as a single organism an organism that naturally diverges from

639
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:07,720
its origins or naturally enacts its original

640
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:21,000
uh what naturally enacts its original endowments and propensities by diversifying

641
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:33,320
that leaves me challenged to the same problem that any biologist be challenged with which is

642
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:37,240
explain the the mechanism that produces the diversification

643
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:45,560
we have no explanation so we go back to the problem of you find a wristwatch

644
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:50,840
all right you find something as complex as a wristwatch and by the way let's be very clear

645
01:30:51,880 --> 01:31:00,840
a cell is i don't know 10 to the 900 times more complex than a wristwatch so you find one of those

646
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:11,400
you know imagine i don't know imagine you're walking around on a

647
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:14,680
on a new planet

648
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:25,880
and you find what i don't even know a hyper computer the size of a pinhead

649
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:36,120
you discover that there's these little pinhead like crystals on the ground when you examine them

650
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:42,360
you determine that they're hyper computers they can warp time you can do all kinds of impossible things

651
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:52,040
and you decide oh the universe must just have accidentally produced these

652
01:31:55,880 --> 01:32:03,560
that like the possibility of accidental production of an organism is so much more remote

653
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,280
than the accidental production over wristwatch

654
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:19,160
there's no chance there's no way we could understand

655
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:27,720
how such complexity could be accidentally produced in the time frame we suppose now

656
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:38,280
if you know it's not even clear that the universe has been around long enough to do that not not

657
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:46,520
clear enough to me um given our estimates of its age and presuming that what we're thinking about

658
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:51,720
is time is even relevant at the scale of the universe which it may not be could be totally

659
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:58,280
some other property that governs that and possibly most likely one we have no concept for

660
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:09,720
all right so what else what other problems so many problems

661
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:10,920
um

662
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:20,200
there are still people who believe and do science around the supposition

663
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:27,480
that it's a mechanical accident and it's reproducible we can figure out how to produce the

664
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:38,280
mechanical accident in the lab and thus produce life forms from forces and substances

665
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:52,120
the hubris implicit in the

666
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:55,560
um suppositions

667
01:33:58,440 --> 01:33:59,720
of the materialists

668
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,720
and those who

669
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,640
unjustifiably

670
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:19,000
presume that no intelligences were involved in the production of the intelligence with

671
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:29,240
which they examine the question all right it's an accidental you know it's an epiphenomenon right

672
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:38,760
of the nature of time space planets and stars all right they just accidentally produce these

673
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:48,040
minds there's nothing mind like in them there's nothing metamind like there's nothing transcendent

674
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:59,000
in them and it's an entirely mechanical process unguided by anything all right it's just not

675
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:10,280
the only thing that guides it are in some way the forces uh which would be you know chemical

676
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:17,400
bonding properties chemical transformation properties gravity electromagnetism strong

677
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:25,400
force the league force etc etc seems unlikely to me so that's been a fascinating i never really

678
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:35,560
believed that to be honest um i never supposed i didn't trust the doctrines

679
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:47,000
i can sense dark doctrines and sort of smell the stink of them in various branches of science

680
01:35:47,000 --> 01:36:01,560
and philosophy and i tend to be uh i let's just say i have great antipathy for them

681
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:07,960
in my own view there are a variety of intelligences

682
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:16,600
i don't merely suppose that intelligences were involved in the composition of organisms i take

683
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:25,640
the claim much further it seems very likely to me that something beyond intelligence was involved

684
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:34,520
probably in the construction of time space because you have a similar problem there

685
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:43,880
right which is the fine-tuning problem and it's a huge problem now there is one way to

686
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:54,840
sort of what's the right word there's one way to account for the fine-tuning problem

687
01:36:54,840 --> 01:37:07,240
that's a little strange but interesting to mention it is that you have a sort of a popcorn machine

688
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:14,840
right but instead of producing popped kernels of corn it produces universes and most of those

689
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:30,440
universes are not viable the forces don't interact quote unquote properly or in such a way as to

690
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:40,680
what what is meant by viable is achieves extent in time

691
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:45,640
so

692
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:53,640
you keep bubbling these universes up from some universe progenitor field okay

693
01:37:55,400 --> 01:38:06,680
and the non viable universes mostly quickly dissolve and only the viable universes persist

694
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:15,640
so you will naturally if you find yourself anywhere if you find yourself at all you will find yourself

695
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:21,320
in a persistent universe otherwise you won't have a self to find or find with

696
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:29,560
and this is sometimes offered as an explanatory

697
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:30,920
uh

698
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:37,160
unexplanatory prosthesis

699
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:40,120
for

700
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:50,760
for the strangely perfect you know the goldilocks universe

701
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:56,600
and the goldilocks solar system both right because you have to have both you can't have a

702
01:38:56,600 --> 01:39:02,760
goldilocks universe i mean you can't have a goldilocks solar system in a non goldilocks universe so

703
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:14,760
in this model something just keeps producing nascent universes and some of those turn out

704
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:19,480
to be viable and you will only have minds and bodies and organisms in those that do

705
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:27,800
therefore that you know sort of explains the uh the existence of the fine tuning problem

706
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:33,240
what was myers objection to that it was kind of brilliant i know he was using someone else's

707
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:48,520
objection i wonder if i can recall it i don't think i can but yeah i find this fascinating and

708
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:57,160
brilliant because these are serious scientists they are not theists um even though one of them

709
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:04,200
might be religious maybe a couple of them are i'm not sure um but they're not attempting to

710
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:11,560
import god right they're not trying to sneak god past your scientific nose they're saying look

711
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:18,920
the complexity we're discovering here cannot have been produced there's not enough time to have

712
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:30,680
produced even some of its more basic features in terms of the age of the earth now i could see

713
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:39,720
that someone could say produce the features off world somewhere import them to the earth and

714
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:44,840
then things go along fine i can imagine that line of argument but you you you may have the

715
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:51,000
same problem elsewhere what's the actual lifespan of a planet presuming that that's that life only

716
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:56,680
occurs on planets which is something i don't presume since i don't know where life originates

717
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:03,400
i i tend to be open minded and speculative about that but yeah we've got a huge problem with the

718
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:08,920
origin of life on earth in modern science the problem is steeped in doctrine the doctrine

719
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:16,920
makes no sense never made sense similar to the move to evacuate the universe of meaningful

720
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:22,360
intelligences right because we were we were science was so busy trying to get rid of god

721
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:29,160
that it threw everything away and just decided no it's all it's all just mechanics dude there's no

722
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:38,760
there's no evidence of any kind of um there's no evidence of any kind of intelligence version

723
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:49,480
of what we used to call the ether which probably got replaced by the the the

724
01:41:51,880 --> 01:42:00,120
the propensity of time space to curve around mass to become curved at at at complex structure

725
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:06,040
and now more than like there may be forces that we don't know about too right i mean i'm

726
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:12,120
quite sure there must be constants and forces that we haven't discovered that might naturally

727
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:17,000
mechanically produce life but we can't argue for the existence of those until we have some

728
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:24,440
evidence of them and we can't make arguments that this the complexity we're seeing just plopped out of

729
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:32,200
a roulette wheel there's no real chance of that being true as far as i can see

730
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:39,560
so i am now home and safe and alive i am grateful for all of you who have

731
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:45,160
braved this long journey with me the terrifying noise of the wind in the mic
