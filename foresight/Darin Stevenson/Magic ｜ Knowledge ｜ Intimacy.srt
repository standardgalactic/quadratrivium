00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
Hello everybody. Welcome. I have just

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,160
reattached my wind buffer to my wired

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:22,560
Apple headset, microphones, or

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,240
microphone. It's not particularly windy,

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,880
but I'm sort of pleased with the simple

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,120
solution of wrapping a cotton ball

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:41,360
around the mic and securing it with a

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,440
... there's probably a formal name for

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,120
these objects, but a bread wire. Right?

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:01:03,760
Those little wires that sometimes close

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,680
the bread package. Hmm. A lot of contrails

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,400
in the sky today. I suppose there are

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,220
people who suspect that every time they

14
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,480
see a contrail, they're seeing what

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:33,240
chemtrails. Pretty sure most of those

16
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,720
contrails are just vapor caused by vapor.

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,600
The engines heat the air, makes a vapor

18
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,200
trail. There might be occasionally, and

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,440
some places, some things that aren't

20
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,560
contrails, but I strongly suspect that

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,960
people who spent their lives watching

22
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,400
aircraft and contrails would alert us.

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,880
I know this is a very controversial

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,640
topic that borders on the conspiratorial

25
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,200
but there are other strange problems

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,920
like, I guess, maybe my objection isn't as

27
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,440
strong as I once thought. This often

28
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
turns out to be the case, but one of my

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,840
simple objections was if somebody's

30
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,600
spreading some kind of chemistry in the

31
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,480
atmosphere itself and they're doing that

32
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,200
on purpose, it's going to affect them

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,640
and their children and their children's

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,200
children and so forth. I suppose it could

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,800
be that they don't have any children and

36
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,480
they don't care. This is strange. This is

37
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,400
the second bit of a carcass that I've

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,520
seen today and it's interesting because

39
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,920
I almost never see bits of carcass and I

40
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,440
walk here every day. Is it just that

41
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,520
today I'm noticing what I don't notice?

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,080
Or is today a bit of carcass day? I just

43
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,960
don't know. They're rather disgusting.

44
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,560
Little chunks of fleshy, bloody, gristle

45
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,920
and fur and things. Certainly

46
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:29,640
unappetizing. I don't necessarily have

47
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,040
a plan for this talk today. We'll see

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,240
where it goes. I was thinking about

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,200
some things. Various kinds of magical

50
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:51,320
intent. The transactional kind where you

51
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:57,160
trade something often or sometimes this

52
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,600
is apparently whatever is referred to

53
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,640
by one's soul for some boon or benefit

54
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,280
in the short term. It seems like a

55
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,200
wildly stupid idea to me. Hopefully I

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,160
haven't accidentally done that myself.

57
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:24,320
And the kind where you employ. Wow, what is that sound?

58
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,760
Oh, it's a bird. Oh, it's a baby bird. It's a

59
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:38,120
feed me sound. Oh, okay. There are two

60
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,040
fundamental principles of something

61
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,720
resembling our idea of magic, which

62
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,840
let's face it. It's get or accomplish

63
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,240
something without physically having to

64
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,200
do the thing or, you know, chase the

65
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,400
thing or something. Something like this.

66
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:16,760
So in traditional Blackfoot knowledge,

67
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,280
the language is problematical because

68
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,520
what magic means in English is a broad

69
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,280
array of things. Or actually, magic doesn't

70
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,280
mean anything in any language. It's just

71
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,440
a word. What actually happens with words

72
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,040
is that we use them to mean things to

73
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,720
each other in actual conversations,

74
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,320
unless we're not having conversations

75
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,560
and we're just saying things. And this

76
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,560
becomes very confusing very quickly

77
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,080
because then the presumption that words

78
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,040
have meanings begins to pervade. We have

79
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,360
to interpret the gap. What gap? The gap of

80
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,920
no relationship, no no pre-existing

81
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,560
context, random context, and so forth.

82
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,520
There are ways in which that situation

83
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,920
can become useful for us, but only if we

84
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,720
deal with it very insightfully,

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,720
intelligently.

86
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,800
And what do I mean? I mean,

87
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,800
the randomization of language is a kind

88
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,200
of a paramagical substrate.

89
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,400
What am I trying to mean by magic? Well,

90
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,080
I'm not trying to mean illusionist's

91
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,680
tricks. Fascinating though they are.

92
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,200
And I'm not trying to mean the mere

93
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,920
manipulation of the vulnerabilities

94
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,920
in human thought and consciousness.

95
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,720
I'm trying to mean something more like

96
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,560
perhaps what people usually very naively

97
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,120
mean with the word manifesting.

98
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,200
An idea that I fundamentally mistrust,

99
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,920
or maybe it's just the language that I mistrust,

100
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,960
or maybe I'm ill-informed, which isn't

101
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,680
as rare as I might like to be.

102
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,160
Yes, I'm not, as my listeners know,

103
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,800
a big fan of the secret, or the various cults

104
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,920
that derive their central premises

105
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,040
from such ideas.

106
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:04,360
At the same time, there is something to

107
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,360
a kind of envisioning or dreaming of the future

108
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,160
that is very powerful.

109
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,160
The question is, is it as trivially silly?

110
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Like what happens when you make that idea

111
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,160
explicit is one of the questions. Because

112
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,160
there's a fundamental difference

113
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,160
between peripheral vision and foveal vision.

114
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Between explicit identity

115
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,160
and potential identities.

116
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,160
And in that blur, there's something transcendentally

117
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,160
momentous and powerful.

118
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,160
But if we make the blur explicit,

119
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,160
irony often results.

120
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Meaning direct contradiction with

121
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,160
stated purposes, goals, hopes, desires, intentions,

122
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,160
cautions, and so forth.

123
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,160
And so perhaps what actually bothers me about

124
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,160
the manifesting cults is that they're taking something

125
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,160
that I suspect properly belongs to the peripheral

126
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,160
and making it foveal.

127
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,160
Your foveal vision is the center vision.

128
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,160
It's what you use when you look at something.

129
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,160
It's your peripherals what you use when you spread your gaze

130
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,160
and take in the whole.

131
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,160
And as some of you know, that if you gaze at the night sky

132
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,160
when you look at stars you can see the stars visible to your foveal vision.

133
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,160
When you look toward them,

134
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,160
I'm getting a little wet there.

135
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,160
If you spread your gaze you will see stars

136
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,160
that will literally disappear if you look at them.

137
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,160
And this is kind of what my concern is

138
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,160
as well as a sort of ideological trivialization

139
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,160
of destiny, dreaming, visioneering.

140
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Yes, yes, yes.

141
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,160
Ascent of the herbs. Beautiful.

142
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,160
So yeah I'm getting somewhere near

143
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,160
what sticks in my craw.

144
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,160
And the weird thing about this problem for me

145
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,160
is that by explicitly pointing

146
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,160
at what sticks in my craw,

147
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,160
this is part of the problem with thinking and part of the problem with language.

148
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,160
Once I think I have a sense of what might be going on

149
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,160
I tend to become kind of clingy about that.

150
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,160
And in that clinginess,

151
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,160
well, you know, it's not always

152
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,160
conflicted but it's often produces

153
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,160
significant conflict.

154
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Sage flower, scent, yum.

155
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,160
In Blackfoot the two principles are

156
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,160
similitude and contagion.

157
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,160
And they mix together, they mate, they bond,

158
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,160
they form very powerful abilities

159
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,160
you might call them, as well as faculties.

160
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,160
I'm not going to lecture about that today.

161
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,160
These two principles are also

162
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,160
found in other magical traditions

163
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,160
such as

164
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,160
voodoo, hoodoo,

165
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,160
various

166
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,160
witching ways.

167
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,160
And perhaps also

168
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,160
shamanism. Resemblance

169
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,160
is a way to understand similitude.

170
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,160
And similitude is a very sophisticated word

171
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,160
that my friend Ryan First Diver uses.

172
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,160
Contagion is fairly obvious.

173
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,160
In a way,

174
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,160
to refer to something

175
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,160
directly in consciousness

176
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,160
can often be a bit of a trap for us.

177
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,160
Whereas to suggest it

178
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,160
is much more powerful and in a sense magical

179
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,160
by which I mean transcendentally potent

180
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,160
historically

181
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,160
women, females,

182
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,160
are masters of

183
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,160
indirect communication.

184
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,160
Suggestion,

185
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,160
entranced

186
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,160
which places consciousness into a sort of

187
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,160
a flow state that can then be

188
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,160
directed

189
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,160
or shaped, or both, redirected

190
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,160
so forth.

191
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Yesterday at this spot there was a young woman

192
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,160
sitting on a log up above me

193
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,160
and she was practicing

194
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,160
playing a particular kind of flute

195
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,160
that appeared to be made of wood or possibly bamboo.

196
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,160
I sat down, you know,

197
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,160
without gazing directly at her because once again

198
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,160
suggestion produces problems.

199
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Or, you know, it's occasionally appropriate.

200
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,160
But usually if we're paying direct attention to something

201
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,160
it's often that we have the desire to capture, possess, or manipulate it.

202
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,160
And nobody really wants to be captured, possessed, or manipulated.

203
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,160
There's that explicitness in

204
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,160
language again, of course sometimes we do.

205
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,160
Sometimes we partly want that.

206
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,160
Or an aspect of us desires this while other aspects of us flee from it.

207
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,160
This is the stormy cloud

208
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,160
of what it's like to be human.

209
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,160
I've made it

210
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,160
to the high view.

211
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,160
And there's that thing that looks a bit like Warden Cliff Tower

212
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,160
but is actually

213
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,160
the emergency public broadcasting

214
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,160
speakers.

215
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,160
The peripheral and the foveal.

216
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,160
You know, dreaming consciousness largely corresponds

217
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,160
to the former, waking consciousness to the latter.

218
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Without being

219
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,160
explicit, allow me to suggest that in the daytime

220
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,160
in bright sunlight

221
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,160
the sunlight declares the color and identity

222
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,160
of objects and situations. What they are doing is obvious.

223
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,160
It's explicit, relatively explicit.

224
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,160
Whereas the moonlight, if it's there, or even the total darkness

225
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,160
in total darkness it's pure

226
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,160
suggestivity.

227
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,160
If you don't know where anything is, you can tap your way along the path with a stick

228
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,160
if you're lucky, or skillful, or have practiced that.

229
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,160
If you're very witchy, you can run

230
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,160
in the darkness.

231
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,160
I've never known someone who can do that. I can usually

232
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,160
perambulate. I've heard of people who can run in pitch darkness.

233
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Having practiced a kind of a

234
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,160
way that is natural to humans and animals, but

235
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,160
rarely

236
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,160
siren.

237
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Terrible noise.

238
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,160
Dominates the entire oral sphere.

239
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,160
Thankfully most situations

240
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,160
are highly temporary.

241
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,160
The moonlight suggests

242
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,160
rather than declares identities, and thus

243
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,160
pareidolia.

244
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,160
I need to look up exactly how to pronounce that word.

245
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,160
But the imaginative

246
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,160
experience of shapes and faces

247
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,160
in, for example, the whorling

248
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,160
bark of trees, or the

249
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,160
texture of the surface of the trail,

250
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,160
or the clump of bushes that just happens to be

251
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,160
in a shape that looks like a raccoon, and you can't

252
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,160
at first tell it isn't.

253
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,160
This dichotomy between suggestion and declaration

254
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,160
is very profound.

255
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,160
And similarly in dreaming, because in dreaming

256
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,160
things, beings, and situations

257
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,160
we may later decide, oh, that was my brother,

258
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,160
that was our house, that was this, that was that. But in the actual

259
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,160
dreaming experience, it's not really like that.

260
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,160
It's just a house that's quite different from mine

261
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,160
can be my house. My sister can be a man.

262
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,160
All kinds of strange

263
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,160
amalgams

264
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,160
of possible and actual

265
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,160
form, identity, function, behavior,

266
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,160
ensue.

267
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Usually when

268
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,160
I don't know, when those jays are making that noise, there's often

269
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,160
a raptor in your mind, but maybe not.

270
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,160
It doesn't sound as chiding. It sounds more like

271
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,160
here I am, here I am, I'm over here.

272
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Well though, that looks like a raptor tree to me.

273
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,160
That's a stellar's jay.

274
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,160
Making the calls. See, there's that thing

275
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,160
right of explicit categorical identity.

276
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,160
See, there's that thing right of explicit

277
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,160
categorical identity.

278
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,160
See, there's that thing right of explicit categorical identity.

279
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,160
So there are kinds of magic

280
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,160
that don't really require

281
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,160
trades.

282
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,160
They're not transactional.

283
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,160
And by magic, in this case, I mean

284
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,160
the curation

285
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,160
of time, space, and relationships

286
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,160
in the hope of producing

287
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,160
the resemblance of desired

288
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,160
situations, transformations,

289
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,160
relationships.

290
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Without manipulating them directly physically,

291
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,160
although some kinds of physical activities, such as

292
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,160
ceremony and or ritual, whether they are formal or informal

293
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,160
may be involved.

294
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,160
You know, one can envision

295
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,160
very formally by deciding I'm going to sit

296
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,160
in this place which is powerful

297
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,160
and envision.

298
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,160
But then, you know, think about, okay,

299
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,160
so when you go to sleep,

300
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,160
dreaming tends, for many of us,

301
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,160
some of the time, to resemble breathing.

302
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,160
It just happens. It happens, it's as if it happens

303
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,160
to us and also within us.

304
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,160
Now one can then form intentions

305
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,160
around dreaming, for example, the intention to dream about a specific thing

306
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,160
or the intention to the request

307
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,160
that the dreaming aspect helps us better understand

308
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,160
the situation or experience the transformation

309
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,160
of some kind or gain what we think of as information

310
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,160
about something that's otherwise difficult to know about

311
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,160
as if the dreaming mind has powers that are

312
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,160
irracular and transcendentally seeing and I think it does.

313
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,160
The dreaming mind is an array of faculties

314
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,160
but also some things we might think of as functions

315
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,160
meaning it does stuff,

316
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,160
important stuff, regenerating the organs,

317
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,160
cleansing the metabolism, transforming the energetic

318
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,160
situation in the body,

319
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,160
what we might think of as spiritual energies or soul energies

320
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,160
or life energies or electromagnetic,

321
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,160
subtle electromagnetic stuff.

322
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,160
All of these things the dreaming mind is naturally skillful with

323
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,160
and it does its job much like our heart and lungs do

324
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,160
without much instruction but it can also be

325
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,160
instructed or skillfully developed much like our breathing

326
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,160
perhaps like our heart rate, certainly like our habits of thought.

327
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,160
So we can

328
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,160
have the formal intention

329
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,160
to vision-ear futures.

330
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,160
And there's what I remember when I was younger

331
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,160
the informally vision-earing futures

332
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,160
and they many of them came to fruition

333
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,160
but there was a mix, right? Like I formally wanted to play the guitar

334
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,160
I formally wanted to be a graphic designer

335
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,160
I formally wanted to publish texts

336
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,160
I formally wanted to be a good

337
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,160
fisherman even though I don't really eat fish

338
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,160
I formally wanted

339
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,160
to have a nest like Robert Wagner's

340
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,160
that one sort of came true which I think is

341
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,160
ridiculous although now I'm old and it doesn't matter

342
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,160
much.

343
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,160
I formally wanted to be a secret agent

344
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,160
I also informally wanted

345
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,160
I'm not sure why I have such a

346
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,160
antipathy toward the formalization

347
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,160
of certain kinds of things perhaps I'm not really concerned

348
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,160
about their formalization I'm concerned about the way that

349
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,160
cults utilize formalizations

350
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,160
of principles and

351
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,160
wisdom

352
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,160
to capture

353
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,160
and

354
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,160
abuse people

355
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,160
to disempower and blind them

356
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,160
by giving them the wrapping paper

357
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,160
instead of the gift

358
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,160
hmm

359
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,160
yeah I don't like that

360
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,160
although sometimes it can be very helpful

361
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,160
and this is hard to understand at first glance

362
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,160
we'd like to have societies and situations that are so fundamentally enlightened

363
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,160
that we just climb the ladder together beautifully and successfully

364
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,160
toward self development, mutual development, insight

365
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,160
skillfulness, awareness, wonder, awe, play, joy

366
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,160
humor, eros, all these things

367
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,160
we just climb the ladder together and

368
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,160
are constantly lifting each other above positions previous

369
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,160
or at least into harmonious balance

370
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,160
where health and vitality and rejuvenation

371
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,160
and resurrection

372
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,160
are natural

373
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,160
features of the situation right of course we all hope for this but

374
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,160
in our actual situation sometimes we may

375
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,160
it may be useful to fail

376
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,160
talked about this before

377
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,160
imagine a situation where

378
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,160
everything you do succeeds the first time

379
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,160
and so it requires very little effort and there's

380
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,160
it's going to be extremely difficult to improve

381
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,160
to experience a gain in skillfulness or ability

382
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,160
or function

383
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,160
in order for that to happen there has to be the possibility of

384
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,160
making mistakes

385
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,160
and perhaps of pain and suffering

386
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,160
confusion, ignorance, all these things

387
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,160
so it can be very useful at least in theory

388
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,160
to

389
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,160
to

390
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,160
to

391
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,160
to become

392
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,160
enamored

393
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,160
of a cult

394
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,160
I have

395
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,160
before

396
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,160
and you know

397
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,160
we join the cult, we are enchanted by it

398
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,160
it's very compelling because suddenly we have

399
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,160
belonging, we have an experience of belonging that can be otherwise quite difficult

400
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,160
to

401
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,160
in our modern

402
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,160
common modern situations worst common denominator

403
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,160
talk here but in our common modern situations it can be very difficult

404
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,160
to find a coherent groups that are doing something amazing

405
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,160
and beautiful to belong with and so

406
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,160
this is part of why even though education

407
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,160
is kind of a disaster it's also very

408
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,160
wouldn't necessarily just want to get rid of schools

409
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,160
clearly one might want to

410
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,160
what

411
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,160
mediate you know

412
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,160
positively mediate and transform

413
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,160
the existing institutions

414
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,160
but the schools are very important because they give young people

415
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,160
and the teachers and others

416
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,160
the experience

417
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,160
of belonging together

418
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,160
and so to the cults and so to

419
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,160
the various

420
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,160
pedals on the strange flower of fandom

421
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,160
musical groups

422
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,160
films, sports teams

423
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,160
also the

424
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,160
usually lethally in more ways than one motivated

425
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,160
military

426
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,160
cohorts and such

427
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,160
belonging

428
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,160
belonging

429
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,160
and obviously we get all kinds of pandering around this

430
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,160
social media

431
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,160
panders to this desire

432
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,160
to belong and delivers

433
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,160
largely

434
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,160
counterfeit representations

435
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,160
we steal the

436
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,160
the real thing is stolen, ground up

437
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,160
compromised

438
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,160
essentially destroyed

439
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,160
and

440
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,160
we are sold a broad array

441
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,160
of ever less rich

442
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,160
and powerful counterfeits

443
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,160
this is the common thing

444
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,160
that happens a lot in our

445
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,160
society

446
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,160
now when we come together with and for each other

447
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,160
and we forge intentional social

448
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,160
contexts and cohorts

449
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,160
pods if you will like a dolphin pod

450
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,160
or a primate pod or a whale pod

451
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,160
then we have both a kind of natural

452
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,160
to these gambits and the capacity to lift each other out of them

453
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,160
or even to manipulate them from within

454
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,160
this is the rather covert

455
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,160
version of

456
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,160
the possibilities

457
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:51,160
of our human

458
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,160
sociality

459
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,160
and this can be done

460
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,160
in various different kinds of ways

461
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,160
it can be done

462
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,160
in rather serious ways

463
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:15,160
and it can also be done in more or less playful

464
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,160
or game like ways

465
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,160
and these two can actually merge so that you can have

466
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:27,160
playful games

467
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,160
that actually transform

468
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,160
or ameliorate the

469
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:39,160
humanity and ear sats community

470
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,160
spirituality

471
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:47,160
that is so pervasive in our modern

472
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:51,160
experience it's not the only thing going on

473
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,160
alone when we're isolated it may seem like

474
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,160
the entire context is just violations

475
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,160
and this is what leads people to

476
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,160
terror, agony, self harm, suicide

477
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,160
what we think of as madness

478
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,160
madness is a fairly natural result of the constant exposure

479
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,160
to the kinds of double triple quadruple

480
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,160
you know myriad sorts of binds

481
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,160
right where

482
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,160
that emerge in our experience

483
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,160
of the broad

484
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,160
array of competing anti-cultures

485
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,160
anti-nations, anti-societies

486
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,160
corporations that dominate

487
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,160
our modern experience

488
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,160
and concern

489
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,160
and they are terrible but they're not the only thing going on

490
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,160
and in order to you know it's not just that we discover what's going on

491
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,160
when we begin to form intentional communal groups

492
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,160
even if it's only for a short period of time see this is the key

493
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,160
we can get escape velocity immediately

494
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,160
in a small group with a shared intention to do so

495
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,160
and we can sustain that over time

496
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,160
and give it a heartbeat and that can even reproduce

497
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,160
other little groups that bubble

498
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,160
and prosper even in

499
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,160
the counterfeit

500
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,160
nightmares

501
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,160
from and perhaps against

502
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,160
and out of the

503
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,160
desire to

504
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,160
transcend

505
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,160
these troubling situations

506
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,160
so there are forms of

507
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,160
magic that don't require

508
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,160
or soul-selling and so forth

509
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,160
but are very powerful and some of them are profoundly virtuous

510
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,160
they are not

511
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,160
composed for the sake of vengeance

512
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,160
this is very dangerous motivation generally speaking leads to

513
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,160
a lot of trouble in almost every case

514
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,160
they are not war machines

515
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,160
primarily for personal gain

516
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,160
they may not be entirely selfless

517
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,160
though they can be composed under such circumstances

518
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,160
but they are resistant to capture

519
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,160
yeah

520
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,160
by selfish manipulative

521
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,160
or war-like motivations

522
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,160
and they can also be profoundly

523
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,160
protective

524
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,160
healing

525
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,160
calming

526
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,160
nurturing nourishing

527
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,160
and these forms arise

528
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,160
from an ache that I suspect we all come

529
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,160
to human incarnation with

530
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,160
the

531
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,160
it's an ache for the positive

532
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,160
version of justice which is the dissolution

533
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,160
of injustices and their replacements with virtues

534
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,160
now again if once either of these ideas become highly explicit

535
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,160
there's going to be a lot of trouble

536
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,160
most of the time

537
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,160
if you're explicitly concerned with virtue

538
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,160
this tends to produce irony

539
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,160
if you're explicitly concerned with harm or vengeance

540
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,160
or war you're going to have irony

541
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,160
cleansing

542
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,160
cleansing

543
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,160
bathing

544
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,160
smudging

545
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,160
um

546
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,160
nurturing grounding

547
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,160
getting your feet, your bare feet

548
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,160
out of the ground

549
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,160
surrounding you know

550
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,160
going into nature, going into the living waters of the river or the ocean

551
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,160
the lake, the stream

552
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,160
these are potent and powerful precursors

553
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,160
to the formation of the kinds of intentions

554
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,160
that naturally become

555
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,160
that naturally influence

556
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,160
without dictating futures

557
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,160
and transformations of situations

558
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,160
I was speaking with someone

559
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,160
maybe about a week and a half ago

560
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,160
and I asked him if he had ever prayed

561
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,160
and I don't think I ever really got

562
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,160
the impression that something was listening

563
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,160
and that's a very rational

564
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,160
response, sensible

565
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,160
why should we engage in

566
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,160
activities whose effectiveness we have no way to determine

567
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,160
well you know that's one

568
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,160
effective but I wonder if it ever occurred to him

569
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,160
that whether or not someone was listening

570
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,160
or something was listening

571
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,160
the transformational effects

572
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,160
could be profound either way

573
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,160
they could be profound neither way

574
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,160
they could be profound both ways

575
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,160
they could be profound even if there was no way to understand

576
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,160
how or why they were in fact profound

577
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,160
because

578
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,160
somehow

579
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,160
our behavior

580
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,160
transforms our potential

581
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,160
and the fact or fiction

582
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,160
in many cases

583
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,160
either doesn't matter or

584
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,160
can be very limiting

585
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,160
so yeah

586
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,160
these are things to consider

587
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,160
I heard once that some president

588
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,160
perhaps it was Bush

589
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,160
a prayer

590
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,160
it's like attempting to study

591
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,160
I don't know

592
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,160
something that cannot be

593
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,160
cannot be detected

594
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,160
by the methods we would ordinarily

595
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,160
presume I heard this morning of an experiment

596
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,160
to establish what's called the Weisman barrier

597
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:43,160
in biology

598
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,160
a feature of biology that is certainly wrong

599
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,160
and yet has been canon for a very long time

600
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,160
in modern, in terms of modern science

601
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,160
and the experiment was absurdly stupid

602
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,160
and yet everyone supposed that it was one of the greatest biological

603
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,160
experiments that had ever been done

604
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,160
well perhaps not everyone

605
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,160
it was very common to suppose this

606
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,160
yeah so had people pray

607
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,160
for sick people and so on people who knew them and people who didn't

608
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,160
and apparently the study produced

609
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,160
the result that the people who were prayed for were actually

610
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,160
less likely, slightly less likely to recover

611
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,160
than those who were not prayed for

612
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,160
experiments

613
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,160
and rational thought

614
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,160
and science are very powerful tools

615
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,160
their scope though is quite limited

616
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,160
compared to that which is

617
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,160
you could say that which is the case

618
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,160
but not that which is

619
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,160
their scope is different from reality

620
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,160
the scope of rational thought

621
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,160
is similar

622
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,160
in its limitations to the scope

623
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,160
of the physical manipulation of objects

624
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,160
I can move hammers all I want

625
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,160
much of my experience

626
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,160
cannot be reasonably

627
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,160
affected, cannot be

628
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,160
properly transformed or successfully

629
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,160
transformed by my manipulation of hammers

630
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,160
and if I should fall under the

631
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,160
delusion

632
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,160
that my capacity to manipulate hammers

633
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,160
is the only way for me

634
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,160
to achieve

635
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,160
true and valid belief

636
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,160
conceptual or procedural

637
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,160
insight

638
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,160
understanding

639
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,160
then I'm going to be in a really bad situation

640
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,160
one imagines

641
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,160
someone that

642
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,160
is a boatwright but specializes

643
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,160
in the formation of the

644
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,160
skeletal precursors to the hull

645
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,160
and they think

646
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,160
this is the only important thing the skeletal precursors

647
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,160
can't have a hull without these

648
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:07,160
they only build skeletal

649
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:11,160
they only build the frame and the frame doesn't

650
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,160
float and they think

651
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,160
that they are an expert and that they know everything about boats

652
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,160
because they do the most important thing which is produce the frame

653
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,160
my presentation of the metaphor was a little

654
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,160
sketchy there but I think you get the idea

655
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,160
this is similar to the

656
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,160
overvaluing of rational frameworks, models, explanations

657
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,160
theory, experiment

658
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,160
and so on

659
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,160
when one does, when we do experiments

660
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,160
we

661
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,160
try very desperately to evict most of what's going

662
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,160
on from the context so that we can control

663
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,160
the resulting context

664
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,160
and its variables well enough

665
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,160
to acquire deterministic knowledge

666
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,160
of cause, effect,

667
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:47,160
future transformations

668
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,160
and this is a very compelling method

669
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,160
but it can also be blinding

670
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:59,160
in tests to determine

671
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,160
whether things like telepathy exist

672
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,160
they do, I assure you

673
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,160
I am as sure of telepathy as I am of breathing

674
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:21,160
very few if any of the experiments

675
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,160
took a fundamental feature of telepathy into

676
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:29,160
the experimental context, what is this feature

677
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,160
intimacy

678
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,160
deep

679
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:41,160
mutual concern and awareness

680
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,160
which is naturally

681
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,160
productive

682
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,160
of various forms of non-ordinary awareness

683
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,160
and sensing of the state needs, thought, concern, desires

684
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,160
of the other, natural between

685
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:05,160
mothers who adore their

686
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,160
young and newborn children

687
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,160
though it's not merely a matter of the young and the newborns

688
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:17,160
natural

689
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,160
between dogs and cats and their human companions

690
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,160
probably other pets, natural between

691
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,160
certain insects and humans

692
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:33,160
birds, reptiles even

693
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,160
but you know we hear

694
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,160
well there's no evidence, nobody's written a paper about that

695
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,160
there's nothing in the literature, I remember one day I was here at this lake

696
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:49,160
talking with an ornithologist and I explained that by careful observation

697
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,160
I had determined how to sex

698
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,160
how to determine the physical gender of geese

699
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,160
the snow geese, white cheeks, the Canadian geese

700
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,160
Canada geese I think they're called

701
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,160
which by the way I'm pretty sure isn't named after the country

702
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,160
I think it's named after a man whose last name was Canada

703
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,160
I think I heard someone saying this, they might have been

704
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,160
having their friend on

705
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,160
yeah I explained by careful observation over time because this is a quest I undertook

706
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,160
I realized the geese can tell for sure

707
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:37,160
each other's gender by sight

708
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,160
and if they can tell we can tell but in the literature

709
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,160
it is claimed that it cannot be determined, it can be determined by behavior

710
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,160
but not by appearance

711
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,160
and I didn't believe that

712
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,160
so I went on a quest, it took me a few years, it wasn't until I met

713
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,160
an old goose couple, an older couple

714
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,160
which is very uncommon in nature because old geese don't survive in nature

715
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,160
but in cities they can

716
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:13,160
and then in them the distinctions were

717
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,160
highlighted, exaggerated

718
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,160
and so I said to this guy, I was like you know

719
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:25,160
there are ways to visually determine the gender of these birds and he got very upset

720
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,160
and literally said there's nothing in the literature about that

721
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:33,160
and I was like how about we just look at some birds together

722
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,160
and let's see if we can do it, nope, there's no evidence

723
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,160
we hear this all the time, there's no evidence of faith

724
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,160
healing, no evidence of God, no evidence of angels, demons

725
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:49,160
I would argue that Facebook and Google are pretty strong evidence of demons

726
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,160
not to mention

727
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,160
many other bizarre features of our modern world

728
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,160
so

729
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,160
if you decide to not look for evidence or if you decide that

730
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,160
previous experiments not done by you

731
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:31,160
explain for all eternity what exists

732
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:35,160
what doesn't, what it doesn't, doesn't do, what it can and cannot do

733
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,160
then you have become

734
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:43,160
theory-blinded

735
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:47,160
because in point of fact

736
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,160
we speak and think

737
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:55,160
as if

738
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,160
that which has previously been established

739
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:03,160
is continuous and permanent

740
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,160
when there's no evidence of any permanent thing

741
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,160
and continuity is relative

742
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,160
it's not concrete, it's relative

743
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,160
and the nature of time itself can change, the nature of light can change

744
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:23,160
and the behaviors can change, does change

745
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,160
if you're dreaming you're still perceiving

746
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,160
so

747
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,160
it's very important to be able to distinguish

748
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:39,160
between

749
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,160
there might be stuff that's nonsensical in a dangerous way

750
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:47,160
that we should avoid

751
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,160
acting it, acting as if it's true

752
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,160
on the other hand

753
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:59,160
life and thought, our bodies, our relationships

754
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,160
as human beings are fundamentally experimental

755
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:11,160
the fact that there are concrete realities

756
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:15,160
that

757
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:19,160
doesn't mean

758
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:23,160
that all previously known

759
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,160
exemplars of fact

760
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,160
are the concrete foundation of our existence

761
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,160
or our reliable guides to futurity

762
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,160
you know what

763
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,160
Nassim Nikolas Taleb calls black swans

764
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:53,160
which are previously unknown phenomena

765
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,160
happen all the time, the current models of time space and such

766
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:01,160
all come from black swans

767
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,160
no one expected that Einstein was going to come along and go like

768
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:09,160
I think this distinction between space and time

769
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,160
while it seems very obvious

770
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:17,160
intuitive is wrong

771
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:21,160
and then Arkhani Hamed and others of his ilk came along and said

772
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:25,160
this perspective that

773
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,160
time space isn't must be

774
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,160
fundamental to all that's going on

775
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,160
not only is unlikely but can't be the case

776
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:41,160
black swans

777
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:45,160
come

778
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,160
into our awareness

779
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,160
and obliterate previously

780
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:03,160
dominant biases

781
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,160
and when they do so they are usually liberating

782
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:11,160
we gain new degrees of freedom

783
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,160
insight, wonder, play, ability, function

784
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:19,160
so on

785
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,160
the findings of science theory and experiment are provisional

786
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,160
they will be overturned

787
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,160
it's not they might be overturned, they will be overturned

788
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,160
and so we should recognize that the terrain ahead

789
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,160
isn't the ignorant

790
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:47,160
you know

791
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:55,160
I'm not sure what to say, there's a word I'm looking for

792
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:59,160
the crippling suppositional

793
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,160
certitude that oh we've already determined

794
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:07,160
what a goose is

795
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,160
and now we know, well I doubt it

796
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,160
the fact is we don't know what anything is

797
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:19,160
we have highly provisional toys

798
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:23,160
and when we exchange those for wonder and curiosity

799
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:27,160
passion and insight

800
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:31,160
something inside us begins to die

801
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:35,160
you know what we have mostly

802
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,160
as moderns

803
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,160
is not knowledge, it's representation

804
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,160
and representation in language and concept

805
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:51,160
is

806
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:55,160
deceptively powerful

807
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,160
and it is this deception

808
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,160
see here is magic

809
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,160
here is transcendental influence

810
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:11,160
by which we can be captured and manipulated

811
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:15,160
what we have is something

812
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,160
that replaces intimacy with tokens

813
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:23,160
words

814
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,160
maps, models, hypotheses

815
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,160
because actual knowledge

816
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,160
is intimate like kissing

817
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:39,160
and if you experience

818
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,160
the inflowing and indwelling of this knowledge

819
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:47,160
it will not be like thinking, it will be like orgasm

820
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:51,160
it will be like kissing

821
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:55,160
it will be like death

822
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,160
it will be like birth

823
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,160
some of you may notice a radical transformation

824
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:07,160
in the vector of my

825
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:11,160
my illocution

826
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,160
but yes, science

827
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:19,160
is powerful

828
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:23,160
but it is not the arbiter

829
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:27,160
of meaning, identity, purpose, value

830
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:31,160
fact

831
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,160
truth

832
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:39,160
and we see this kind of

833
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:43,160
refraction away from

834
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,160
science in many domains of our

835
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:51,160
modern social experience

836
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:55,160
the problem with that particular refraction is that some of that

837
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:59,160
is a weaponized sigh up

838
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:03,160
nations

839
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:07,160
are experimenting with how to kill each other's populations

840
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:11,160
with information

841
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,160
and so we have the mixture of the truth

842
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,160
of the danger for example of the covid vaccines

843
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:23,160
with

844
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,160
the intent

845
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:31,160
to deceptively harm populations

846
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:35,160
right, the

847
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:39,160
this is very common unfortunately in our modern

848
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:43,160
situation

849
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:47,160
but yes

850
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:09,160
all my father's life he thought he

851
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:13,160
knew what a tree was and then one day at the mirror

852
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:17,160
pool here in this garden where I'm standing

853
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:21,160
I accidentally enchanted him and we sat on this bench

854
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:25,160
where a woman is sitting now and he

855
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:29,160
began to have what might be described as an

856
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:33,160
emergence event and he turned to me

857
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,160
and he said we have to leave, I am dying

858
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:41,160
I'm going to become this tree and he was quite

859
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,160
he was simultaneously

860
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,160
hello

861
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:53,160
nice to see you today

862
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:57,160
he was simultaneously alarmed and ecstatic

863
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:01,160
he had never had an experience like this

864
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:05,160
drugs were not involved he felt he was becoming

865
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,160
the tree and I tried to calm

866
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:13,160
him I told him it'll be okay we can leave if we must

867
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:17,160
he said we have to go we have to leave and then a squirrel climbed up his

868
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,160
leg and up onto his shoulder and he said see see even the squirrel

869
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:25,160
knows I am a tree this is intimacy

870
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:29,160
and trance can produce

871
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,160
the potential for modes of intimacy that

872
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:37,160
I thought must extinguish

873
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:41,160
speech is very similar

874
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:45,160
I was talking with someone the other day about their dreaming experience

875
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:49,160
and gosh who was it

876
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:53,160
whoever it was

877
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:57,160
he said I don't think

878
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,160
I remember speaking in a dream and I was wildly

879
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:05,160
surprised I was partially surprised because most of us think

880
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:09,160
it's the keyword we think that we

881
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:13,160
have the experience of having many of us have these

882
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:17,160
memory of an experience resembling conversation in

883
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:21,160
dreaming and that part is true it resembles conversation

884
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,160
but as it moves more and more

885
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:29,160
explicitly toward the semblance of speaking

886
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,160
the manifold that supports the dreaming is collapsing

887
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:37,160
the intimacy is disappearing

888
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:41,160
one way to end an experience is to speak about it think of

889
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:45,160
two people passionately kissing

890
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:49,160
and one of them then

891
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:53,160
for whatever bizarre

892
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:57,160
reason of dissociative confusion decides that the most

893
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:01,160
important thing in this moment is to say something

894
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:05,160
the speech ends the experience

895
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:09,160
language is deceptively weird in that

896
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:13,160
we think it gives us the power to communicate

897
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:17,160
it does but primarily in the layer of representations

898
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:21,160
which is not the same layer as experience

899
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:25,160
and certainly not the same layer as intimacy

900
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:29,160
where in this mess is science

901
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:33,160
science is

902
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:37,160
in our time at least demonic

903
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:41,160
and when I was a child I wanted to become a scientist because it seemed that these were the people

904
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:45,160
who best knew

905
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:49,160
complete knowledge of things being

906
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:53,160
circumstances, origins, futures and so forth and machines

907
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,160
were very fascinating to me because it was as if in my previous

908
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:01,160
incarnations these things didn't exist and now they do

909
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:05,160
and they seemed quite impossible

910
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:09,160
not even the thing like a zipper this is impossible

911
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:13,160
how much more impossible is a thing like a mouse

912
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:17,160
you know humans can compose

913
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:21,160
a zipper they cannot compose a mouse

914
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:33,160
so you see this kind of representational

915
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,160
knowledge is extremely dangerous because it evicts us

916
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:41,160
from

917
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:45,160
what I would call transcendent participation

918
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:49,160
and that's where our actual

919
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:53,160
spirit

920
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:57,160
our capacity

921
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:01,160
to forge purposes beautiful, noble and true

922
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,160
and to embody and enact them together arises

923
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:09,160
not from knowledge

924
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:13,160
from participatory intimacy

925
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:17,160
you know we

926
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:25,160
because we are embodied humans

927
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:29,160
eventually one way or another

928
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:33,160
most of us

929
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:37,160
the last majority of us have an experience that we call orgasm

930
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:41,160
and for some of us this happens in childhood

931
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:45,160
and for others it's in our teens and for some

932
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:49,160
it might not be even until our adulthood

933
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:53,160
and there are more life phases than those ones

934
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:57,160
as well

935
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:01,160
but there are

936
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:05,160
experiences of intimacy that make what we think of as

937
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:09,160
orgasm seem trivial in comparison

938
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:13,160
and these are four modes of intimacy

939
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:17,160
that's not true

940
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:21,160
no it's true

941
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:25,160
there's a broad array of experiences that are normally

942
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:29,160
well they are very successfully inhibited in us

943
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:33,160
moderns and there's a broad array of

944
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:37,160
modes of cognition the use

945
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:41,160
the reformation or the formation

946
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:45,160
of modes of awareness, consciousness

947
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:49,160
things that resemble thought and so forth

948
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:53,160
that are so different from everything we've ever imagined

949
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:57,160
and yet are natural to our kind of being

950
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:01,160
our form, our humanity, our animality

951
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:05,160
our values, our organismality, our beingness

952
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:13,160
there are

953
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:17,160
modes of intimacy

954
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:21,160
so ecstatic that you would never trade them for an orgasm

955
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:25,160
and this is part of why we hear

956
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:29,160
some mystics singing the praises

957
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:33,160
of

958
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,160
what the

959
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:41,160
ascetic path

960
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:45,160
the path of not

961
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,160
of non-indulgence

962
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:53,160
the path of chastity or temperance

963
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:57,160
and you know dreaming

964
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:01,160
really is very very profound

965
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:05,160
and in dreaming there can be modes

966
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:09,160
of adoration and eros that are vastly

967
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:13,160
beyond what we are inclined to usually experience while awake or

968
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:17,160
beyond what seems accessible to

969
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:21,160
to us while awake

970
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:25,160
in our life phase, in our development

971
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:29,160
but what I'm trying to get at here is that this thing we call

972
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:33,160
orgasm

973
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:37,160
it is in a sense

974
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:41,160
a

975
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:45,160
there's different ways to say this

976
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:49,160
it's a repercussion

977
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:53,160
of participatory intimacy

978
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:57,160
that can be physically produced

979
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:05,160
and since our first experiences with it

980
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:09,160
are usually catalyzed by physical sensations

981
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:13,160
rhythms

982
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:17,160
rhythmic pulsing, rubbing, so forth

983
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:21,160
we should understand that that is a

984
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:25,160
interstasis, a lesser exemplar of something for which there is

985
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:35,160
a forest of superpositions above that

986
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:39,160
and when I was a child and I was fascinated with science what I didn't realize

987
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:43,160
is that I had no way to understand this

988
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:47,160
although some people tried to say something maybe this is why

989
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:51,160
the problem ensued

990
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:55,160
there didn't seem to be anyone whose knowledge was deeper than

991
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:59,160
the knowledge of scientists

992
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:03,160
but the knowledge of the poets, of the mystics, of the philosophers

993
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:07,160
of the adoring ones

994
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:11,160
this knowledge makes

995
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:15,160
the powers of science

996
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:19,160
shrivel

997
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:23,160
they are still mechanically powerful and may in fact snuff our planet

998
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:27,160
and our people

999
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:31,160
yes they are physically very powerful

1000
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:35,160
but where is the intimacy

1001
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:39,160
it is that participatory intimacy that we

1002
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:43,160
hunger for and when we hope

1003
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:47,160
not for justice

1004
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:51,160
but for

1005
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:55,160
the diminution

1006
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:59,160
the

1007
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:03,160
transformative composting

1008
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:07,160
of injustices

1009
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:11,160
it is this participatory

1010
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:15,160
intimacy

1011
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:19,160
that we know

1012
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:23,160
we sense would thereafter

1013
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:27,160
obtain

1014
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:31,160
and become

1015
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:35,160
the water

1016
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,160
the many forms of waters

1017
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:43,160
in which our hearts

1018
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:47,160
and histories and futures could then

1019
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:51,160
swim

1020
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:55,160
we

1021
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:59,160
we

1022
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:03,160
we poor moderns

1023
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:07,160
have named nearly everything and thus evicted

1024
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:11,160
all the named

1025
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,160
features and beings and relationships and situations

1026
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:19,160
from much of our experience

1027
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:23,160
yeah

1028
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:27,160
yeah

1029
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:31,160
hmm

1030
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:35,160
we have representational

1031
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:39,160
knowledge

1032
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:43,160
miles deep

1033
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:47,160
how tragic for us

1034
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:51,160
that is the

1035
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:55,160
the alexandrian library of the skeletal remains of what

1036
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:59,160
might have been understanding and insight

1037
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:03,160
medicinal awareness

1038
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:07,160
transformative ecstatic participation

1039
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:11,160
magic wonder play

1040
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:15,160
all

1041
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:19,160
virtue

1042
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:27,160
walking in the botanical gardens here

1043
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:31,160
even though

1044
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:35,160
this is a place curated by

1045
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:39,160
my extremely confused at the group level species

1046
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:43,160
the living beings here

1047
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:47,160
they form a

1048
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:51,160
a manifold over

1049
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:55,160
the strange

1050
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:59,160
dead inside evictions that otherwise prevail

1051
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:03,160
as cities and roads

1052
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:07,160
shops and buildings and so forth

1053
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:11,160
and they are ecstatic

1054
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:15,160
and in our way of being in time

1055
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:19,160
this ecstasy would flow into and through

1056
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:23,160
and around and between

1057
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:27,160
all the aspects of our being in such a way as to draw us

1058
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:31,160
into transcendent visionary awareness

1059
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:35,160
and I don't say this

1060
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:39,160
because I know it this isn't knowledge

1061
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:43,160
I'm on the verge of experience

1062
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:47,160
I'm on the verge of the experience of what I hear

1063
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:51,160
suggest

1064
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:55,160
we are not distinct

1065
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:59,160
in the ways our common thought

1066
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:03,160
suppose

1067
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:07,160
or create

1068
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:11,160
or create

1069
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:15,160
and there are games afoot there are missions here so beautiful

1070
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:19,160
that the entire history of language and knowledge

1071
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:23,160
has nothing to do with them

1072
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:27,160
there's no thing you can formally know

1073
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:31,160
that's more interesting

1074
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:35,160
than the kiss of your beloved

1075
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:39,160
of that food grown by your grandmother in her garden

1076
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:43,160
on endless afternoons

1077
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:47,160
to make the foods

1078
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:51,160
the families would consume

1079
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:55,160
together

1080
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:59,160
mostly in distracted confusion

1081
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:03,160
especially once

1082
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:07,160
the

1083
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:11,160
the invention of televisions began to become dominant

1084
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:15,160
and think for a moment of what the television is replacing

1085
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:19,160
there's a reason that thing is so compelling

1086
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:23,160
was so compelling it's a reason why we have these screens

1087
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:27,160
they are counterfeiting something

1088
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:31,160
and if you think just a little bit you will see what they are counterfeiting

1089
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:35,160
and what it is is something resembling group dreaming, group telepathy

1090
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:39,160
group organized, group missioneering

1091
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:43,160
organized group anemnesis

1092
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:47,160
and this is what we must reach for together if we are to retrieve

1093
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:51,160
the faculties

1094
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:55,160
the ecstasies

1095
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:59,160
the beauty of our origins and natures and potentials

1096
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:03,160
and that's a mission I adore

1097
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:07,160
and do believe in

1098
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:11,160
and if my humble

1099
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:15,160
speaking

1100
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:19,160
can contribute

1101
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:23,160
then I will have lived this day

1102
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:27,160
in a way worthy of

1103
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:31,160
my ancestors and their dreams

1104
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:35,160
my progeny and their dreams

1105
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:39,160
which dreams must not

1106
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:43,160
be euthanized

1107
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:47,160
my thought, language, machine

1108
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:51,160
modernity, war, prison-eering, commerce

1109
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:55,160
tokenization, representation

1110
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:59,160
and conviction

1111
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:07,160
there are many ferns here

1112
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:11,160
I've always loved the forms of the plants

1113
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:15,160
the insects are impossible

1114
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:19,160
the organisms on this world are fundamentally

1115
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:23,160
impossible

1116
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:27,160
the staggering burdens of representational

1117
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:31,160
cognition ecstasy would naturally arise

1118
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:35,160
because we ourselves are

1119
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:39,160
and are surrounded by

1120
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:43,160
infinite manifolds of impossibly beautiful wonder

1121
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:47,160
organism

1122
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:51,160
origin

1123
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:55,160
spirit

1124
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:59,160
purpose

1125
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:03,160
the superposition from which the concept of beauty is derived

1126
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:07,160
the living bubble

1127
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:11,160
of being, history and future and purpose

1128
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:15,160
that naturally

1129
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:19,160
in beauties up from the soil

1130
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:23,160
I die like trees

1131
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:27,160
rain ecstatic

1132
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:31,160
originary true vital

1133
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:35,160
oh how I adore these organisms

1134
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:39,160
how confused I mostly am

1135
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:47,160
when deprived

1136
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:51,160
of that fundamental participatory intimacy

1137
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:59,160
which is true recognition

1138
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:03,160
and explosive anemesis

1139
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:07,160
thank you for joining me

1140
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,160
I'm so grateful to have this time

1141
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:15,160
take a moment to like

1142
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:19,160

1143
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:23,160
or share something personal

1144
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:27,160
in this way you will

1145
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:31,160
help

1146
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:35,160
help my humble efforts

1147
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,160
reach more people

1148
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:47,160
may your ways be beautiful

1149
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:51,160
your hearts be light and your relationships

1150
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:55,160
exquisite

1151
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:59,160
