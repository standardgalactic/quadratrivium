0	12000	Hello, everybody. Welcome.
12000	25000	It is, perhaps May 3rd. Time has been a little strange for me lately because I've been laid up.
25000	38000	After having a salad a couple days ago, my body freaked out.
38000	45000	So I've mostly been in bed and doing a whole bunch of sweating.
45000	56000	I'm not sure what I have in mind to share today. There's no organized colloquium,
56000	73000	but it's been a little while since I made a recording, so I thought I'd have a go at it and just see where it goes.
73000	88000	You know, a lot of our experience is structured by a broad array of expectations that are instilled in us
88000	94000	by the cultures we grew up in and the places where we live.
94000	103000	And we should be willing to imagine that what it would mean to be human would be radically different
103000	113000	if we were growing up in a different context.
113000	127000	Oh, yes. The calla lilies and their predilection to attract, at least around here, crab spiders, which I love.
127000	135000	They're really awesome. There's a male. You can see a male in this one.
135000	140000	I was speaking with a friend and she was talking about her daughter's education in Italy
140000	147000	and how radically different it is from what would happen to her here.
147000	155000	And notice I say happen to her because there's a huge difference between being subjected to something
155000	160000	that effectively ruins your mind and perhaps your heart
160000	181000	and being drawn into a rich developmental conversation that nourishes and supports your development.
181000	188000	When she brought her daughter to Italy, the educational system there, they were doing things
188000	198000	when she was 10 and 11 that we wouldn't do here, if ever, until college.
198000	215000	And I've heard this story so many times, so many times before.
215000	224000	Although it's possible to acquire a well-rounded and rich education in the United States,
224000	233000	it's profoundly difficult, add or expensive.
233000	245000	And if there's one thing I want to be absolutely clear about, it's that in nations as sophisticated and wealthy as ours,
245000	250000	there are at least two things for which there should be no charge whatsoever,
250000	254000	and those are education and healthcare.
254000	260000	If we can afford $23 trillion to support the military,
260000	265000	we could take one of those trillions and educate our people and their children.
265000	275000	And we could take another of those trillions and give them healthcare that was actually profound, advanced,
275000	283000	sophisticated, and effective.
283000	291000	In any country where healthcare is a business, you have a fundamental conflict of interest,
291000	297000	and the same is true of education.
297000	302000	If people want to argue, like, we should all pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps,
302000	307000	my argument is go make a country where you do that and leave us alone.
307000	314000	Just get the hell out of here.
314000	322000	I remember I often have complex conversations with cabbies.
322000	329000	Cab drivers are a particularly interesting kind of human,
329000	341000	and I would argue that they were much more interesting before the advent of GPS and electronic navigation,
341000	347000	because they had to have a map.
347000	352000	Their minds were maps.
352000	357000	And I had a couple of close friends who were cabbies in the 90s.
357000	360000	One of them was a poet. I wonder if I can recall his name.
360000	363000	It's been so long since I thought of him.
363000	369000	But what a brilliant and sensitive human being he was.
369000	374000	Ken Wainio was his name.
374000	383000	And I think I published one of his stories in my magazine, Cyanosis.
383000	391000	Oh, by the way, if any of you want a copy of that magazine, you can make a comment,
391000	399000	and you can have a copy for about ten bucks.
399000	410000	It's more of a book. It's a large book rather than a magazine.
410000	422000	In the 90s, I was publishing this art and literary journal because I saw the Republicans going after arts and education
422000	435000	with the obvious agenda of creating a situation where the general American populace
435000	443000	was ignorant enough to just be directly manipulable by propaganda,
443000	459000	which you can see is an agenda which has largely, if not completely, succeeded a very short time later.
459000	461000	Tragically.
461000	475000	But I remember not too long ago, I was in a cab with a driver from Pakistan,
475000	481000	and he was talking about their educational system and the education that he received there,
481000	488000	and what happened when he came to the United States in an attempt to continue it.
488000	502000	And basically, when he was like ten, eight, nine, ten, they were teaching the children advanced calculus, right?
502000	511000	Or was here, and when he came here, he had to go through some of the, you know,
511000	521000	in order to get a degree, he had to go through some of the American education stuff for which he had no records in the U.S.
521000	533000	And the education that he received at eight, nine, or ten in Pakistan was superior to the understanding of the teacher
533000	546000	at the college he was going to here to the degree that he was constantly correcting the teacher.
546000	553000	You know, I myself left school when I was twelve,
553000	560000	and I recall a situation last week where,
569000	574000	you know, I was on Facebook, unfortunately, probably for everyone,
574000	584000	and there was a picture meme of some guy, and it said something to the effect of,
584000	593000	you know, we've gone from teaching Latin and Greek in high school to teaching remedial English in college,
593000	610000	and some para-feministic females were yelling about the fact that, you know,
610000	615000	this guy was some kind of right-wing idiot, and we shouldn't listen to him.
616000	627000	And I said, you know, I don't think it's a good idea to dismiss the truth based on your evaluation of someone's character.
627000	637000	That's a formal example of the ad hominem rhetorical fallacy, which is to fail to address the subject,
638000	644000	and to instead concern yourself with character assault.
644000	654000	And a number of women, some of them quite intelligent, piled onto my comment and just started telling me what an idiot I am
654000	658000	and how the ad hominem fallacy doesn't even matter.
658000	661000	It's not really a thing.
661000	669000	And I was like, yeah, if we're going to start dismissing knowledge and truth based on the character of someone who says something,
669000	676000	you can, like, it's the end of rational intelligence. It's over with.
676000	685000	You know, it's not untrue that they were, you know, making accusations of patriarchy and colonialism and blah blah.
685000	694000	You know, the general, the common left-wing, these days largely bullshit arguments.
694000	700000	And what I mean by bullshit is it's not bullshit that there's been patriarchy.
700000	702000	It's not bullshit that that's caused harm.
702000	706000	It's not bullshit that there's been colonialism all over the place
706000	716000	and the catastrophic devastation of cultures and peoples and women and children and men and all these things.
716000	718000	All of that's true.
721000	730000	But it's possible to weaponize this concern into something that makes us dumber every time we make a move.
730000	733000	And that's what I mean by bullshit.
734000	739000	The weaponization of the possibility of virtue.
739000	748000	We should be very cautious about prosecutorial historicity.
748000	755000	Because once we become very concerned with prosecution and indictment,
756000	765000	most of our intelligence is going to be subject to the costs of those behaviors.
765000	769000	And those costs are not sustainable.
769000	775000	You have to be really careful with what you do with a mind and what you choose to do with it.
777000	782000	Suspicion, indictment, prosecution.
782000	786000	They maybe have their place in certain circumstances,
786000	791000	but if that becomes the primary intellectual agenda, it's over for human intelligence.
791000	805000	Like that whole prospect of insight or intelligence collapses into war mind, righteous indignation.
805000	816000	I was very surprised to see a couple of women who were clearly quite articulate and intelligent and well-read
816000	825000	dismissing the ad hominem argument that I made, which was not only valid,
825000	829000	you know, apparently there's no such thing as facts anymore.
829000	832000	And I get the whole idea that facts are relative.
832000	835000	I'm a fucking, I study semantics.
835000	837000	I'm not an idiot.
837000	844000	In fact, I realized that facts are relative a long time ago, more than 20 years ago.
844000	851000	But there are domains in which we must rely on,
851000	856000	we've got to have a foundation of some kind that is trustworthy.
856000	863000	And if we're going to decide that there are no facts, that we all just get to make up whatever facts we like,
863000	876000	I don't think anyone is capable of understanding the cascade of social, intellectual, ecological,
876000	882000	and relational catastrophes that they're from will ensue for certain.
883000	893000	The idea that nothing is true simply because bad men said it,
893000	905000	or nothing is true because truth is a patriarchal con game, a colonial war game.
905000	911000	You know, there's a tiny bit of, there's a seed.
911000	916000	Wow, this guy's a genius.
916000	924000	There's this guy who paints here and his spirit of his art is really profound.
924000	930000	Yeah, that stuff's fucking leafily toxic.
930000	934000	See, I was very surprised because here's the problem.
934000	938000	You go back to what this man may have actually said.
938000	950000	We're just talking about a meme here, but they're trying to do a character attack on a guy who's saying something that's so true and important.
950000	952000	What the hell is the goal?
952000	957000	We're going to dismiss what he said because we think he was a bad man,
957000	963000	or an avatar of the patriarchy or the right.
963000	966000	Jesus, so here's the actual problem.
966000	969000	I left school when I was 12.
969000	973000	I'm a self-educated person.
973000	979000	The technical term is autodidact, and I'm precociously self-educating.
979000	987000	Many of my closest friends are similar,
987000	996000	and some of them are at or above my own par.
996000	999000	What shall I do with this lady?
999000	1003000	She'll get crushed if she stays here, so I guess I got to try to move her.
1003000	1008000	Let's see what's going on here.
1008000	1010000	Give me a moment.
1010000	1012000	Come on, sweetness.
1012000	1015000	Just climb on the leaf. You're okay.
1015000	1018000	I want to get you off the path.
1018000	1029000	That's it. Good girl. Good girl.
1029000	1033000	That was a female bumblebee.
1033000	1037000	Let me be really blunt about one thing.
1037000	1042000	That bumblebee is female.
1042000	1046000	The gender that can reproduce, let's be clear.
1046000	1050000	It's not a joke. It's not a concept.
1050000	1055000	It's a physical situation.
1055000	1061000	In any case, I'm a self-educated person.
1061000	1066000	Briefly, I attended college for the first time when I was 24.
1066000	1072000	I took a couple of classes, one class in music theory.
1072000	1079000	The teacher was horrible and hated teaching the class.
1079000	1086000	One poetics class, also a really bad teacher.
1086000	1095000	And one, I took a class English 1A, which was essay writing.
1095000	1101000	And the teacher of that class at Santa Rosa Junior College
1101000	1106000	was a man named Richard Speaks,
1106000	1110000	a relatively brilliant poet in his own right,
1110000	1116000	a fairly radical teacher, very 60s,
1116000	1121000	Zen in the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance kind of guy,
1121000	1126000	regularly flirted with female students, married one of them,
1126000	1130000	who was probably 25 years his junior,
1130000	1142000	targeted for a lot of attacks on his, what, romantic acumen.
1142000	1150000	And, you know, occasionally, I love a little criticism at him.
1150000	1154000	I wouldn't say that he was a chauvinist.
1154000	1161000	I think he was fascinated and intrigued by women.
1161000	1172000	He was an older guy, wrote a motorcycle, rolled his own cigarettes.
1172000	1174000	He was a really good teacher.
1174000	1180000	He was more like a rock star than an English professor.
1180000	1185000	And I took a class with him and he tried to convince me to become a teacher
1185000	1193000	because he said that he saw in me the gift
1193000	1198000	that would grow into something really amazing.
1198000	1204000	But at the time, I couldn't understand undertaking a project
1204000	1211000	that would require five years to complete.
1211000	1214000	I wasn't even sure I would live five more years,
1214000	1218000	and this is a problem with not just my generation,
1218000	1221000	but the generation successive to mine,
1221000	1227000	where we find it incredibly difficult to believe in anything resembling a future,
1227000	1233000	and therefore we can neither plan nor develop one.
1233000	1249000	This is tragic and appropriate.
1249000	1259000	And so Speaks asked me to teach with him the next semester
1259000	1263000	and teach the English 1A class.
1263000	1267000	We were teaching Barry, what's his name,
1267000	1273000	Crossing Open Ground, Naturalist Author.
1273000	1279000	We were teaching Siddhartha and E.B. White,
1279000	1283000	who by the way, if you've never read any essays by E.B. White,
1283000	1286000	you're missing out on something profoundly.
1286000	1290000	I mean, all of them are geniuses.
1290000	1293000	Also Joan Didion, oh my God.
1293000	1298000	Yeah, she became one of my heroes and profoundly influenced my writing.
1298000	1303000	In fact, many of my heroes are women.
1303000	1306000	And when I say that, I want to again indicate,
1306000	1314000	I'm talking about the actually existing gender that reproduces.
1314000	1320000	And if anyone out there wants to have some kind of a fight with me over this,
1320000	1322000	go ahead and raise your sword.
1322000	1327000	I'll meet you on the battleground, we will go together to war.
1327000	1331000	I'm not saying there are only two genders.
1331000	1335000	I'm saying that biologically, in humans,
1335000	1340000	fundamentally there are two genders.
1340000	1348000	Ideologically, different situation.
1348000	1353000	And I don't know why I'm feeling so militant about this today,
1353000	1358000	but the idea that someone might attack me
1358000	1364000	and claim that I'm making shit up to believe in a single reproductive gender
1364000	1370000	and that kind of anything else
1370000	1377000	is a symptom of a catastrophic array
1377000	1386000	of linguistic and conceptual distortions.
1386000	1391000	Ideological distortions.
1391000	1397000	I have no problem with anyone who wants to be seen in a certain way.
1397000	1404000	I have a huge problem with anyone who wants to police my language over that
1404000	1413000	or tell me that it's a law, that there are 79 genders.
1413000	1417000	Yeah, that's nonsensically ridiculous.
1417000	1425000	It's also a symptom of a breakdown in an aspect of human social relation and cognition
1425000	1436000	that I think we should be particularly concerned with and vigilant in.
1436000	1442000	Now look, my opinions aren't as fundamentalist as they sound here,
1442000	1445000	but we're not yet having a conversation, right?
1445000	1447000	I'm speaking ex-cathedra.
1447000	1452000	This is my recording, I'm saying what's on my mind.
1452000	1460000	I'm totally willing to enter into meaningful, generative conversations about such topics
1460000	1466000	with people who are more, you know, when we are interested in learning together,
1466000	1469000	that's very different from declaration,
1469000	1474000	but for the moment this isn't a conversation, I'm speaking.
1474000	1479000	So, I agreed to teach the class with Richard and he was like,
1479000	1486000	look dude, I really want you to have the experience of being in front of a classroom and teaching.
1486000	1491000	I think you're made for this and it'll go really well.
1491000	1495000	So, here's what I'll do.
1495000	1497000	We'll call you a reader.
1497000	1500000	I'll get you a little bit of pay.
1500000	1504000	You can actually do some reading and grading of papers.
1504000	1516000	But what you'll really be doing is showing up for every class and co-teaching the class with me.
1516000	1524000	So, I did that thing.
1525000	1532000	And in fact, not while the class was going, but after the class had stopped,
1532000	1545000	I ended up dating one of the girls in the class who was quite a bit younger than me.
1545000	1547000	It's true, I did.
1547000	1553000	Willow, she was awesome.
1553000	1566000	So, we had a class of about, you know, we had three classes of approximately 30 people,
1566000	1573000	ranging in age from 17 to 27, primarily white.
1573000	1583000	There was one African American young man in that class.
1583000	1594000	Primarily B to A, students, high school graduates.
1594000	1599000	B to A, grade point average, 90 people, Americans.
1599000	1608000	Middle class, white folks, you know, in a fairly upper middle class city.
1608000	1615000	I've said this before, but I'm going back to the meme, right, where we used to teach Latin and Greek
1615000	1619000	in high school, and now we're teaching remedial English in college.
1619000	1621000	Remedial English.
1622000	1629000	Think about the difference in cognitive sophistication between somebody who can learn and speak Latin and Greek
1629000	1635000	and someone who cannot speak English, their only language.
1635000	1649000	So, of the 90 students, approximately five of them were capable of forming a written sentence in English.
1649000	1654000	Two of them could compose a paragraph reliably.
1654000	1659000	They're in junior college, they have graduated high school somehow.
1659000	1665000	They cannot write the single language that they mostly speak.
1665000	1673000	That was in approximately 1994-5, right?
1673000	1675000	Who knows?
1675000	1684000	I shrivel up inside to imagine what the situation is today.
1684000	1698000	If it was that bad back then, and I had no idea that anything resembling this was even possible.
1698000	1708000	You know, having been a reader my whole life and being somewhat hyperlexic,
1708000	1716000	it never occurred to me that the people around me might be incapable of writing English.
1716000	1719000	I was staggered.
1719000	1722000	I knew there were problems with American education.
1722000	1728000	I had no idea how catastrophically severe they were.
1728000	1731000	It was mind-blowing to me.
1731000	1739000	We didn't have time to teach them how to write sentences or paragraphs because we were trying to teach them how to write essays.
1739000	1747000	And they were so catastrophically unprepared that, effectively, as teachers, our goal was impossible.
1747000	1751000	We managed to do a little bit of it.
1751000	1764000	So, again, the women who attacked me on Facebook, with all due respect, which isn't much,
1764000	1776000	they're attacking someone who's sounding an alarm bell about the future of their children, of their families, of their progeny.
1776000	1780000	And they're attacking his character? Really?
1781000	1795000	Like, what he's saying is so right and so important that there's no possibility of his character entering into the conversation at all.
1795000	1812000	It's as if something in these people is offended by the possibility that they might have to take facts seriously.
1812000	1825000	Look, there are all kinds of people who I don't agree with or who propose perspectives that I dislike or don't agree with.
1825000	1841000	If I were then to dismiss the entire uvra of their creative or intellectual output, the poverty would land in me.
1841000	1846000	It would land in me, in my heart, in my mind.
1846000	1867000	The idea that we should cancel or throw away the knowledge, the intelligence, the insight of people with whom we find some reason to feel uncomfortable.
1867000	1883000	That's the death knell. That's the ringing of the bell of a kind of apocalypse in consciousness, awareness, intelligence, insight.
1883000	1893000	If you wanted to ruin an entire generation of humans, just get them doing that.
1893000	1901000	If you let that monster in the door, I can't wait to see what comes after that.
1901000	1915000	There are certain mistakes that we have to not ever make if the possibilities of our intelligence are going to survive.
1915000	1927000	One of the women just said, I fiercely disagree with you when I explained what an ad hominem attack is and means.
1927000	1938000	Unfortunately, for her opinion, what the quote said was a fact.
1938000	1949000	We are teaching remedial English in college. We have been doing that in the United States for at least 20 years, probably more like 40.
1949000	1954000	Which means we are catastrophically failing to educate our children.
1954000	1966000	And if that's not interesting enough to get their attention, and if the fact that they have a character problem with someone who's saying that is more important.
1966000	1975000	If you see the problem, like the wrong thing is getting emphasis here, for sure. Not maybe.
1975000	1984000	I don't know anything about the guy. I don't care what who the guy is. He was a right-wing asshole, good for him.
1984000	1987000	What he was saying was true and important.
1987000	1995000	As Eric Weinstein often says, there are exactly zero restaurants where I walked in the door and signed up for the entire menu.
1995000	1999000	Yes, I'll have everything.
1999000	2016000	And it's similar with spiritual or intellectual or any kind of thinker at all.
2016000	2026000	All of the brilliant men and women who have been the mothers and fathers of my mind proposed things that were wrong.
2026000	2030000	Or things that I completely didn't agree with.
2030000	2040000	Alfred Korzybski, one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century, largely ignored, was insane.
2040000	2065000	He said that criminals having ostensibly given up the right to participate in the human project should be the subjects,
2065000	2078000	should have their bodies taken away from them and be the subjects of scientific experimentation for the cause of bettering humanity.
2078000	2083000	That is one of the most insane things I've ever heard in my life.
2083000	2090000	Does that mean I should disabuse myself of the entire subject of nonaristotelian logic?
2090000	2097000	One of the most important features or forms of human cognition I've ever encountered? Fuck no.
2097000	2103000	Korzybski was a genius. He was also partly insane.
2103000	2107000	And many geniuses are partly insane.
2107000	2111000	Many of the geniuses we revere are partly insane.
2111000	2136000	That doesn't entitle us to dismiss the incredible insight that they suffered and made sacrifices to bring to the experience of being human.
2136000	2148000	Thankfully, I'm not particularly interested in ideological jousting on Facebook.
2148000	2158000	But in this one case, I was willing to pull my dagger and point out the ad hominin problem.
2158000	2166000	And I was shocked to see one of the women who responded, who's a friend, a Facebook friend.
2167000	2171000	Sweetness. I love you.
2171000	2175000	I think it's the scarf.
2175000	2178000	Yeah.
2185000	2192000	When I have my scarf tied to my purse strap, dogs often look at me weird and want to approach me.
2192000	2196000	And I think it's because they've never seen that particular feature.
2196000	2202000	And it's visually. It stands out visually.
2206000	2224000	So, yeah, one of the women is a friend of mine on Facebook and very intelligently attempted to explain why she also didn't agree with the ad hominem.
2228000	2234000	I really have a hard time with people who don't agree with the rhetorical fallacies. Do they even understand them?
2234000	2259000	I mean, these are the figures of speech that are not merely the catalogue of sophistic methods for manipulating human thought, concern, values.
2259000	2270000	You know, sophistry is a problem when we don't recognize it because we can be manipulated by language.
2270000	2285000	But the arts of rhetoric form essentially the foundations of the possibility of articulate linguistic communication.
2285000	2292000	Not only should we not dismiss them, we should be teaching our children these things.
2292000	2304000	And in, you know, the privileged classes of Europe, primarily the males, yes, it's true, they were taught something called the Trivium.
2304000	2315000	And I think this was like rhetoric, geometry, and one other thing that I can't remember.
2315000	2323000	It meant like the three important things. But one of them was rhetoric, and that's not an accident.
2323000	2336000	People who are not educated in rhetorical sense and the capacity for complex rhetorical speech.
2336000	2352000	You know, everyone loves Shakespeare and part of the reason they love him is that Shakespeare, whoever that might have been, was a master of the tropes, the rhetorical tropes.
2353000	2361000	And that's part of what makes his work so profound, presuming that it was a male who wrote that stuff.
2361000	2371000	And actually, I think there was another feature of Shakespeare that probably largely goes unnoticed, except among scholars, which is that...
2371000	2387000	Is this a queen cell? From a beehive? I don't know. No, I don't think so. It looks similar, but it isn't.
2387000	2392000	Okay, let's see what's going on here.
2392000	2409000	You know, Shakespeare basically was a hyper-system of consciousness extending over a number of brilliant actors, a specific theatrical milieu or array of milieus,
2409000	2436000	and the intelligences common in the rhetorical and sophistic network of minds in which the audience and the societies participated or which they forged together.
2436000	2449000	So that's not like a regular human at all. That's someone who's touching what I call the Cognition.
2449000	2460000	That mind isn't merely human, and it's blatantly obvious that this is so.
2460000	2482000	It's not dissimilar with other prodigies. People who rise up above the idea of the individual and the scope of an individual's intelligence into the sort of stratosphere of human cognition and concern in general
2482000	2502000	achieve a kind of superposition over the possibilities of an individual mind. It's blatantly obvious that many poets, Rilke, Rumi, others,
2502000	2512000	whether or not they were conscious of this, they certainly practiced it.
2512000	2532000	I would argue that Joan Didion is another example, as is Eva Braun, a philosopher of incredible intellectual breadth and depth.
2533000	2546000	You know, I was raised by feminists. I'm almost a feminist. I used to go to a national organization of women meetings, not claiming that gives me any special privilege or cachet or gravitas.
2546000	2562000	But the intellectuality of the 1970s feminists was some of the first actual intelligence in humans that I ever directly encountered.
2562000	2580000	You better believe I have respect and reverence for that, until and unless that fundamental intelligence for which I have respect and reverence becomes weaponized.
2580000	2596000	At that point, I don't merely diverge, I oppose.
2596000	2612000	There is a kind of respect and reverence that we extend to all beings and to all persons.
2612000	2628000	When I see people, and there is similarly a kind of respect and reverence, that we extend to skillful people.
2628000	2644000	And when I see something like the opposite of this, when I see people attack an entire gender, which is what is going on right now with the bear meme, effectively.
2644000	2654000	And I'd like to decompose that a bit, but I'll hold off on that so that I can stay on topic for a minute.
2654000	2680000	When I see a group, when I see ideological, the rise of sort of ideological, weaponized ideological invective, character assault, the dehumanization of males.
2680000	2708000	And there's no justification for that. None. Historically, we have lived under the ages of various modes of patriarchy. Bad humans are bad humans, regardless of their gender, and the fact that there are bad males does not pervade over the entire gender.
2708000	2730000	The fact that there are bad people doesn't pervade over entire cohorts either. This urge to generalize wrongdoing for the sake of indictment is a disease that leads to catastrophic sequelae that none of us want.
2731000	2759000	I mean, maybe some of us do want it. I don't know. Maybe there are people who actually want a devastating, unlivable future forged by the appearance of virtue under the flag of virtue above a complex array of weapons that obliterate intelligence, insight, community, family, tradition.
2759000	2785000	All these things. I guess I'm kind of ranting a little bit, but I find a lot of this upsetting. At the point when I began to become an adolescent, I was no longer allowed to attend the now meetings, and I began to realize that the feminists were anti-male.
2785000	2807000	Back then, I didn't really understand, though my mother had tried to explain to me that some of the women in the group were lesbians. I didn't really understand what that meant. Some of them didn't seem particularly feminine to me.
2807000	2833000	And these days, one's not even supposed to say words like that. As if one's not supposed to suppose that there is a relatively intrinsic, not merely scripted aspect to the gender interiority and expression of human beings.
2833000	2852000	And while I will agree that some degree of that is not wrong, it's not an entirely wrong idea. You can't throw the whole idea out the window just because there's gender scripting.
2853000	2870000	And this is a very complex topic, which I'm addressing rather cursorily at the moment. And for that, I apologize, but it's not really my goal to get into the politics of gender here.
2870000	2894000	Rather, I'm trying to talk about a situation where what we might think of as left-wing intellectuals are attacking foundational principles that underlie the possibility of intellectual discourse, perception, perspective, and so forth.
2894000	2912000	Anyone is welcome to think that the solidity of concrete isn't a fact. It's a patriarchal projection. Well, you know, trip and fall and you're going to find out that there's a fact right underneath you.
2912000	2932000	So if you think there are no facts or the facts are just a construct, you're wrong. You're just going to be wrong. In fact, if you think there are no facts, let's suppose someone just says something like, well, you know, people just make up facts to manipulate other people.
2932000	2953000	Okay, that does occasionally occur. That's not not happening. But that doesn't we have the same problem of the generalization of a portion of a curve to the entire curve. If you come and tell me there's really no such thing as facts, well, then what you've just undermined your own statement.
2954000	2973000	Because what you are saying, in effect, is that it is a fact that there are no facts. You see the problem here? Truth in language and concept is real. It's not real the same way physical reality is real.
2973000	2997000	It's conceptually real, it's linguistically real, and it's cognitively real. And it can also be relationally real. So there are actual facts. You know, my friend Dr. Kay was talking to me last night and helping me to disambiguate my illness and figure out whether it was time for me to go to the emergency room or not.
2998000	3010000	And quite frankly, if there was an emergency room for human intelligence, our civil, our culture should go directly there right now. Because this shit is failing.
3011000	3035000	And part of the problem is that America is, as I've said before, we're a petri dish for every kind of conceptual and linguistic PSYOP imaginable. We're just getting PSYOP injections a thousand times per minute from 5,000 different bad actors.
3036000	3048000	I can't wait to see how our children are going to fare in a situation like that. We've got to create some kind of immunity for each other against that. And perhaps that's part of what I'm trying to do here.
3049000	3068000	And maybe even to bolster my own immunity to some degree, because I have to try to understand how to cope with situations where people tell me, you know, ad hominem attacks are things we should do, right? The ad hominem perspective, that's the right one.
3068000	3080000	You know, enacting rhetorical fallacies is intelligence. That's visionary. That's the way of the future.
3099000	3125000	It was so strange to see the articulate, the very articulate woman objecting. And her argument was, I wish I could just state it, maybe I could go find it and say it.
3126000	3136000	What I'll probably try to do is later I'll put it in the comments just so that I don't have to depart right now from the recording.
3140000	3148000	Also, it would take me a bit, and I don't want to lose my train of thought, even if my train of thought is not particularly coherent at the moment.
3155000	3179000	So what was my friend Dr. K saying? He was saying that he's reading a book with an argument between a neuroscientist and a mathematician, and the neuroscientist is trying to claim that mathematics has no privileged status among the languages.
3186000	3196000	One of my Raven friends is here with me. He's like a foot from me giving him peanut, which they really like.
3196000	3216000	Now, this has been an ongoing conversation between Dr. K and I, although mostly we're on the same page.
3217000	3226000	So Dr. K is a vicious opponent of Wittgenstein and Heidegger, also of Jung.
3226000	3232000	Dr. K claims that Jung was a Nazi, and we shouldn't listen to him.
3232000	3244000	And by the way, Dr. K is committing the ad hominem fallacy there, because Heidegger was a Nazi and Jung was a Nazi.
3244000	3251000	We should largely dismiss them, which of course I do not agree with.
3252000	3264000	If Hitler himself had said intelligent things, I would take them up and not reject them simply because they came out of the mouth of a maniacal, methodic tyrant.
3264000	3272000	I don't care about the character when it comes to intelligence and insight. I don't care.
3273000	3279000	Consider the source. Well, if it's food, maybe. If it's intelligence, not so much.
3279000	3291000	I suppose I could invert my perspective and forge an argument where I'd call it like the poisoned pool argument.
3291000	3299000	You don't want fish from a poisoned pool, so you don't want intelligence from minds that are bad or evil.
3299000	3304000	Okay, yeah, I could propose and pursue such a line.
3304000	3315000	I'm disinclined to at the moment, but just be aware that I'm not an ideologue, and I'm happy to entertain perspectives that oppose my own.
3315000	3325000	And if I weren't, I would be catastrophically incapable of learning.
3325000	3330000	A friend of mine the other day on Facebook, a very close friend, said,
3330000	3346000	when was the last time you had a conversation with someone who disagreed with you?
3346000	3352000	When was the last time you entertained the perspective of someone with whom you disagreed, something like this?
3352000	3360000	And for me, the last time was usually today, maybe yesterday.
3360000	3380000	I regularly, there's an old euphemism about being able to entertain perspectives alien to your own concern, belief, habit, and so forth.
3380000	3397000	And how crucial that is to philosophical discovery and understanding and awareness and intelligence, and I agree.
3397000	3405000	But let's start out with an agreement that we're here to see better together, to help each other see better together.
3405000	3414000	If we begin with that agreement, and that's our motivation and our goal, we're in pretty good shape, right?
3414000	3423000	We're unlikely to get trapped or stuck in the weeds of our own bias, habit, et cetera.
3423000	3426000	And those weeds are thick and sticky.
3426000	3428000	I don't want to get stuck in those weeds.
3428000	3434000	I don't trust my own bias, but that doesn't mean I don't trust anything I think either.
3434000	3455000	Some of my biases have crucially important foundations that I'm disinclined to dispose of on a whim.
3455000	3470000	On the other hand, my pet biases often are very blinding, but I need somebody intelligent enough to show me how the structure of my thought is failing me.
3470000	3477000	And I have a great wingman, Ms. R.
3477000	3494000	Yeah, that wingman really helps me because Ms. R's mind is very different from mine and tends toward uncollapse, toward specificity,
3494000	3503000	whereas even though I can do both, I tend to go toward specificity.
3503000	3506000	And I'm very nervous about generalizations, right?
3506000	3521000	Especially sloppy generalizations where malfeasance or malignance is generalized to an entire clade, as is happening with the bare meme.
3521000	3532000	Which I am interested in dissecting, but probably won't do here.
3532000	3544000	You know, I recall a not entirely dissimilar meme that I felt was valuable.
3544000	3556000	It's important that we hear the voices of women and that we hear the concerns of women.
3556000	3571000	Ms. R was telling me that for portions of her life,
3571000	3579000	she felt completely unsafe being around people at all.
3579000	3594000	And this constant sense of vulnerability and danger probably had a variety of anchors,
3594000	3613000	but the primary one is blatantly obvious and has a lot to do with the danger of being a woman in a world dominated by men.
3613000	3631000	And even us males know something of what that's like because most of us have been subject to the viciousness of a man or a group of males,
3631000	3644000	especially in our childhood, who bullied, beat, raped, denigrated, spat on, kicked us.
3644000	3651000	Whereas, you know, how many of us were subject to gang violence from females?
3651000	3657000	Not none, but nearly none.
3657000	3661000	In terms of boys anyway.
3661000	3668000	So look, I get it. I remember this meme where somebody asked women what they would do if there were...
3668000	3676000	How would it affect their life if there were a curfew for males, like a 6pm curfew or something?
3676000	3683000	They said things like, I'd wear a dress, you know, or I'd go for a walk.
3683000	3691000	In other words, I'd feel okay doing ordinary human things.
3691000	3698000	And I'd feel safe doing ordinary human things.
3698000	3705000	And I think that's real. I absolutely acknowledge that.
3705000	3726000	We forget, unless we hear very directly, unless there's a context in which women can speak openly about their experience.
3735000	3743000	And what it feels like, we won't know, and our suppositions won't be sufficient.
3743000	3747000	So I absolutely support that.
3747000	3755000	But the generalization...
3755000	3775000	That happens where the character of my gender is disposed of or denigrated.
3775000	3779000	That is...
3779000	3785000	How the hell is that?
3785000	3805000	That's like hate speech. That's genderist invective.
3805000	3812000	The fact that men are more dangerous than women, probably true generally speaking, depends on the situation.
3812000	3814000	Not always true.
3814000	3819000	There are many men who will lay down their lives for a woman they don't even know.
3819000	3824000	Right now, right? Instantly.
3824000	3832000	So the idea that, you know, men are just bad...
3832000	3836000	I'm not a friend to that idea.
3836000	3841000	On the other hand, again, I do support...
3841000	3844000	You know, let me put it this way.
3844000	3865000	Let's start a conversation where we mutually support each other and create a context where women are safe and free and healthy and happy in all our social contexts and beyond.
3865000	3875000	Let's do that. Rather than just focusing on what's bad, wrong, and terrible about men, true though that may sometimes be.
3875000	3892000	The wise move is to educate our children and each other and create a social and a relational context in which misbehavior is immediately intervened in.
3892000	3900000	I'm going to pause here for a minute because there's something going on in the gardens that I do not entirely understand and I'm going to have to walk through it, so...
3900000	3903000	I'll be back.
3903000	3908000	You know, it's the same.
3908000	3916000	The money we spend on war doesn't help us.
3916000	3934000	The resources we spend on indictment and combat are far better spent on establishing a relational context and envelope in which we become better humans together.
3934000	3940000	We become better beings together. We become better spirits together for each other.
3940000	3953000	And we need to be really cautious, especially today, about divisive narratives.
3953000	3966000	And I'm very concerned because I can see a kind of storm of little psyopsis of divisive narratives bubbling up in American anti-culture.
3966000	3980000	I can't speak for how it is elsewhere, but that shit is pathologically hypercontagious and extremely dangerous.
3980000	3991000	It breeds factionation and it breeds suspicion and once you're suspicious, half your assets are missing.
3991000	4015000	This is the problem with producing dialectics of indictment.
4015000	4023000	And it hurts people who... it makes victims out of innocence.
4023000	4030000	None of us chose... well, I don't know, that's actually true.
4030000	4038000	It's not clear that we chose our incarnate genders.
4038000	4056000	And, you know, I've spent much of my life very concerned about how I am seen as a man in the world by women.
4056000	4069000	So much so that it's been nearly impossible for me to approach women for whom I had affection.
4069000	4076000	Because I'm so terrified of being seen as a bad person.
4076000	4082000	And, you know, one could argue, oh, you know, that's actually a shadow of something that's a lie.
4082000	4086000	You actually are a bad person secretly and that's why you're so scared.
4086000	4089000	Okay, great, I understand the psychological argument.
4089000	4100000	I don't really think that's most of what's going on if it's any of what's going on.
4100000	4105000	It is profoundly challenging.
4105000	4112000	And I respect and want to hear from women about these challenges that they experience and face.
4112000	4120000	But it's also profoundly challenging to be a man and it's even more challenging to be a sensitive man.
4120000	4122000	Much more challenging.
4122000	4138000	So why can't we create a context and a conversation in which we can supportively listen to and understand each other without indicting,
4138000	4153000	without adding to a problem that's already blatantly obvious.
4153000	4161000	And let's be really clear, much of this problem isn't a problem of men versus women.
4161000	4171000	It's a problem of developmental contexts that are fundamentally toxic, media that is fundamentally toxic,
4171000	4180000	the catastrophic miseducation of our children and each other by media.
4180000	4185000	This really comes back to something resembling education.
4185000	4192000	What is the developmental milieu in which we and our children develop?
4192000	4194000	That's where the problem is.
4194000	4202000	It's not men are bad or women are helpless, which of course was never true.
4202000	4218000	Though granted the disproportionate physical force that men can usually table in comparison to women does create a problem in any civilization
4218000	4242000	where the personhood, integrity and spirit of the women isn't revered, isn't respected, or women are seen as objects.
4242000	4246000	In case it isn't obvious, men are objectified too.
4246000	4251000	This is a different kind of objectification.
4251000	4257000	We're objectified as combatants, warriors, things like this.
4257000	4263000	Now I'm not sure that the terrain over which I've wandered today is all that valuable.
4263000	4269000	I'm not even sure if I'll publish this recording, though I probably will.
4269000	4276000	I'm not particularly proud of it because in a way it's a little bit self-conflicted.
4276000	4287000	I've been speaking against the idea of a mind that indicts.
4287000	4296000	I can see the irony here in that I am inditing a mind that indicts.
4296000	4303000	I can jump one level up and see the problem.
4303000	4310000	I will acknowledge that and we'll see if I decide to publish this or not.
4310000	4318000	It's the first recording I've made in quite a while and I've been very under the weather for a couple days.
4318000	4326000	I'm not sure how sharp I am, but we'll see what happens.
4326000	4331000	If I do publish this, I thank you for those of you who joined me.
4331000	4343000	I appreciate your support, interest, enthusiasm, and hope that we will continue to learn and grow together.
4343000	4349000	May your way be beautiful and your life be joyful.
4349000	4351000	Bye-bye for now.
