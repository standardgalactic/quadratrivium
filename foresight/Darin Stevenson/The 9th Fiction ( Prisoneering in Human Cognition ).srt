1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello everybody. Welcome.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Those of you who are familiar with my work know that I'm not really busy or interested in blowing my own horn and etc.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But what I hope that you'll find here on my channel are some living mirrors, some doorways to the origins of our nature, intelligence, and potential

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:01:09,000
that will unlock some cages that we've all been stuck in, that our ancestors were trapped in, that every human being that ever drew breath hoped to find a key to a vector that would jailbreak

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
the bullshit systems that are eating our planet history and future.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And if that's part of your interest, well strap in because we're going to go to the sky together right now.

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, guys got it right.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We are trained to make a variety of fundamental mistakes and from childhood onward, by our parents and peers, by the people who are supposed to be educating us,

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:09,000
by the people who are wearing the costumes of our liberators, of messiahs, of noble warriors, of extreme altruists.

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
They are chaining our feet to the floor.

11
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They are cutting off our wings and stapling them to the fucking chalkboards in the one place that we are supposed to be able to acquire the keys.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Schools.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Universities.

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What the hell is meant by university?

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It literally is supposed to be the city of the universe.

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The place where all of the intelligences in time space come together to sing and speak and show and remind us to resurrect our divine memories of our origins, natures and potentials.

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And what do we get instead, prison bars?

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We are trained to reiterate in thought, expectation, speculation and evaluation a variety of catastrophic errors.

19
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But if you make any one of them, you'll build bars every time you make a move and if you make three, you will be a slave.

20
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So I want to talk about some of these errors.

21
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's a little windy here today.

22
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I've got my mic buffer on.

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We should be in good shape.

24
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I guess we'll find out on the far side of this arc.

25
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So one of the most profound of these errors is that you're merely human.

26
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't expect too much of me.

27
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm only human after all.

28
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, maybe really clear about what being human actually looks like.

29
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If you took the magical, supernormal powers of every physicalized intelligence on Earth, the octopus, the whale, the dolphin, the bat, the praying mantis, the crane, the rattlesnake, the electric eel, the turtle, the crocodile, the mouse, the mole, the eagle, the hawk, the kestrel.

30
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If you unified all those beings, all of the beings, the forests, the coral reefs, the nudibranchs, the plankton, if you unified all the intelligences and forms and abilities of those beings, and then you mated that with the angels, the devas, the jinn, the daimons, the gods.

31
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's what you were born as.

32
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
There's nothing mere about your humanity.

33
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:55,000
There never was, there never will be, except that you are convinced of your fundamental impoverishment according to principles that have nothing to do with who and what and how you came to be incarnate here on Earth.

34
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So one of the first mistakes is that you're only human, and if you don't believe me, watch the hundreds of thousands, the millions of people who escape that bond and directly show you the impossible.

35
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The five-year-old 280 note per minute shredding guitar player from Korea, the ballerinas, the runners, swimmers, the athletes, the dancers, the singers, the occasional scientists, the mathematicians.

36
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The seers, the healers, the real ones, not the mimics.

37
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Watch the dogs and the cats, the dragonflies, because they'll give you hints at the vast terrain of the more than merely human you came here to be and become.

38
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That little seemingly weak, seemingly delicate body you have is capable of things as yet unimagined by human beings, let alone achieved.

39
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And that will always be the case because the actual scope of our potential nature origin and the urgent imperatives we bring to human birth is infinite, is a layered array of infinities.

40
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And when you see someone doing something that appears superhuman, what you're seeing is merely a hint at that depth, a hint to imagine what an actual statement would look like is nearly impossible for us.

41
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:11,000
An actual expression of that infinite potential could move the planet in a moment, could move human history in an instant. That's your potential.

42
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
However divorced we may feel or think ourselves to be from it.

43
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So the first common thing we're taught is a series of limitations that are cognitive, intellectual, spiritual, physical, ideological and relational, that have nothing to do with our nature.

44
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:46,000
They have to do with an agenda, a program, a process, an array of protocols that have long dominated human culture and experience, and particularly human collectivity.

45
00:08:47,000 --> 00:09:10,000
These protocols render us into helpless slaves, eager for any distraction from the agonies we feel at the impoverishments we cannot understand the origins or the opposites of, and those opposites are our birthrights.

46
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:21,000
They are not our birthrights in the sense that someone's supposed to defend you having them, although that would be fabulous.

47
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Now there's something very different. They are the innate necessities of our human nature and our more than human nature, potential, urgency, ache, desire.

48
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And we get sold counterfeits, sex, drugs, rock and roll, violence, commerce, commodification, objectification, representations, video games.

49
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We get sold video games, and you don't need computers to run these. They were running them on humans back when the conquistadors ripped and shredded the American continent, the South American continent, and later the colonizing forces of Europe landed here in obliterated wholesale.

50
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The native indigenous populations here.

51
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Those conquistadors were infected with the disease before they brought it here and reinstanced it, and we are subject to those same fucking deletions and impoverishments here today.

52
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We are a self-colonizing nightmare of new ways to colonize the population per second and to stack up representations of value in banks, representations of power in corporations and governments in the military industrial complex.

53
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We frack the souls of our children to build monuments to despair.

54
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
These we worship.

55
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know who we is.

56
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Perhaps the we I mean here is the absentee we of our possible intentional collectivity.

57
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The absence that appears as a presence, which is one of the most devastating ploys, and one of the most terrifying features of our human experience and lives.

58
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's literally what we see in the horror films.

59
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We see absences appearing as presences.

60
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
This is what drives our cultures.

61
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We could call them that and we shouldn't.

62
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We should just call them diseases.

63
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The military industrial complex, our political systems, our legal systems, and our corporations.

64
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So this is one of the first lies that you are merely human.

65
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The second lie that you're taught is a lie of transference.

66
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And let me frame this lethal fiction so that you can recognize it in your own consciousness, behavior, and the ideation and desperation of your fellow humans all around you.

67
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:10,000
There's a comforting continuity to what we call physical reality, which I'm going to suppose is about one percent of what's actually going on.

68
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And it's the fact that your shoes will probably be where you left them last night.

69
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The silverware doesn't rearrange itself in the drawer.

70
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The ice cubes are still frozen when you take them out of the refrigerator.

71
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The money in the bank mostly stays there unless stolen.

72
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That tree you saw on your walking route yesterday is there again today unless some idiotic arborist in a desperate effort to justify their pay

73
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:53,000
ripped it from the earth and chopped it up into, well, you know, sawdust or...

74
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:04,000
something similar, which happens a lot here where I walk in the park.

75
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That continuity, that reliable unchanging, because of how we are in time, it's unchanging, right?

76
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The stone is still the stone tomorrow. The tree is still there.

77
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We believe we feel most of our lives that we are immortal even though we are aware of the possibility of death and we may have encounters with death.

78
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's our relationship to temporality that convinces us that the compelling continuity of physical objects in space and their organizations is the most trustworthy fact, absolutely reliable,

79
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
not ambiguous.

80
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We don't have to watch over the little stone, you know, the boulder, the mountain. They will be there every day.

81
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And that brings us to kind of comfort because humans have these drivers.

82
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We can be understood to have these drivers orienting our awareness and concern, three of them.

83
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Ambiguity, vigilance, prediction.

84
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Increases in ambiguity, spin up our vigilance. We're constantly concerned about prediction.

85
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This is why we live in dead boxes because any reduction in ambiguity releases us from vigilance.

86
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And thus, we turn from prediction to opportunism, which we certainly prefer to the burdens that prediction places on us, particularly predictions about negative future events.

87
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Events that are undesirable, painful, impoverishing, injuring, isolating, so forth.

88
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So these three drivers underlie human concern and awareness, how we forge our awareness, what we forge it for, how we direct it in consciousness.

89
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And the fiction here is that the staggering predictability of physical reality, objects in space,

90
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:20,000
should be transferred onto the rest of existence so that we presume that the structured continuity of physical space is the prototype of everything else.

91
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Everything else is just like that structured continuity and should be understood that way.

92
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This is what leads to materialistic models in science.

93
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's what leads to physicalist reductionism in philosophic thought.

94
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The transfer of the expectation of structured continuity from physical reality to all other aspects of existence.

95
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Now think carefully about this error because it's very subtle and largely invisible to us unless we concern ourselves with it.

96
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Unless we float it on the waters of thought, it will remain invisible and we will just make the presumptions that, for example, my friend Joe is always my friend Joe, that I know Joe, that I know who Joe is.

97
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And you can see what's going on here because if I claim to know who my friend Joe is, part of the claim I'm making is that I'm not subject to ambiguity as regards Joe.

98
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I know who Joe is. I can predict how Joe will likely respond to a question or situation.

99
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I have properly evaluated Joe due to our long association. Joe is a stable, continuous structure in existence.

100
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Nothing like this is or was ever or could be true.

101
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Ancient peoples were aware of this problem.

102
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:47,000
They had discovered that the capacity for descriptive or denotative language was fraught with prison-earing perils that would obliterate our relationships and humanity, turn us into slaves and prisoners, if we simply obeyed their structure.

103
00:19:47,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So they learned to not do that. They learned to preserve awareness, potential opportunity, creativity, play, transformation, wonder, integrity, honor, respect, awe.

104
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:24,000
They preserved these above all the structured comforts of representational cognition and labeling language.

105
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
They knew their lives and cultures depended on it.

106
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And when they met the colonizers, they thought, they expected, they predicted that these highly intelligent, apparently technologically advanced humans would necessarily understand and enact the same principles that trusted them.

107
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Hmm.

108
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
How tragic.

109
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:44,000
None of us would think that our, you know, presuming that our parents loved us and were loving and kind, that our parents had agendas that would destroy us, ruin our spirits, wreck the many forms of flight we are capable of, flight into the outer space of ordinary humanity.

110
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Hmm. That's very interesting.

111
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:15,000
These two women are directing their rowboat with separate oars, whereas nearly everyone else, one person, rose with both oars at once so that the boat goes fairly straight.

112
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I like their intelligence. I like the daring of their experiment.

113
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So we transfer the expectation of physical continuity onto identity.

114
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And you can see in the strange and partly lethal backwaters of identity politics and gender politics a nascent awareness of the dangers of presuming the continuity

115
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
or predictability of gender or identity.

116
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The problem is, with that, is it should remain actually fluid and once you militarize that domain, you're going to suffer ironic, what, collapses, right, and misunderstandings and prosecutions and indictments and all of this really dangerous distraction from liberation.

117
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So the first lethal fiction is that you're merely human. This doesn't mean that you get to just make shit up and become like a woo goddess.

118
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The people who walk around saying that they're kings and queens because they have a male or a female body or they are goddesses, you know, or whatever.

119
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Without access to the more than merely human domains of our nature is dependent on various kinds of integrity and humility.

120
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:42,000
If you are arrogant and you celebrate arrogance and pump up, inflate your personal identity and your ego, the universe will grind you up and spit out the little bits of tooth and bone that remain with very few exceptions.

121
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So I personally, there's a lot of wind here right now, this could be some noise, you know, I have the mic buffer on so bear with me.

122
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You have no patience for this kind of nonsense. Myself, if you find it attractive or interesting, well see if it serves you.

123
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's the opposite of what I'm talking about. Integrity means honesty. And yes, we are vastly more than human, but to that more is in service of the history and future of all beings.

124
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's not in service to the preservation of Darren's name or my individual prosperity or wealth.

125
00:25:43,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We can see in our cultures another terrifying fiction, which is that the goal is the fulfillment of individual egoic personal desires and liberations from cultural structures via catastrophic wealth.

126
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:29,000
That's a game, that's a vampiric game where the death and suffering of billions of others builds up fortunes in individual and corporate bank accounts.

127
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:50,000
The fiction there is that it's the personal identity and individual fulfillment of a single human being that is the most valuable thing, the righteous thing, the thing you're supposed to do,

128
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:59,000
the thing that if you don't do someone else will, the race to the bottom, perverse incentives, all of this.

129
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:19,000
That leads to dead planets and nightmares, tyrants and false demigods, Bezos, Musk, Epstein, Maxwell,

130
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:39,000
the US military industrial complex, Google, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, the swarming list of lethal vampiric nightmares just keeps exploding into new malignant mutations,

131
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
each one more powerful and accelerated than the last.

132
00:27:49,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's cancer protocol, but the fiction is that the endless unfulfillability of individual identity and power is righteous, appropriate and true.

133
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
This is the opposite of what I'm saying.

134
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Real fulfillment has its root in a kind of divine equanimity, not the concept of equality, not lip service.

135
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And equalities isn't even the right idea, it's flowing transcendental mutuality.

136
00:28:46,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Fame is so often a devastating and miserable outcome of the developmental potentials of a human being.

137
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And many of the famous have painfully come to understand this at absolutely terrifying prices.

138
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I have an essay called The Factories of Emptiness about this on my Medium page.

139
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:42,000
There's a lot of cheering up on top of the strawberry hill here.

140
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So yeah, that's one of the fictions that personal fulfillment.

141
00:29:49,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Now look, fundamentally there's no problem with lift your boat and bring the tide that raises all the boats around you.

142
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:16,000
If it actually raises them and if that commitment doesn't become compromised as it becomes more successful,

143
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:26,000
we can see in historically Google's mandate don't be evil became the opposite of their mandate.

144
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And presently you have a slavering, drooling malignancy at the top of the food chain

145
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,000
and just obliterating the history and future of humanity and nature and so forth.

146
00:30:44,000 --> 00:31:03,000
While pretending to a greatness that can't be had by villains, yet can be mimicked.

147
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:13,000
The fourth fiction that we are trapped on a backwards planet called Earth.

148
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
The humans are certainly backwards. Our cultures are insane. Nightmarish monsters.

149
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:27,000
They're not human. We'll get to that shortly as the fifth fiction.

150
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But what I want you to understand is that this is all the worlds, all of the intelligences in time space,

151
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,000
meaning in the future and in every place in the universe are accessible from here.

152
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:52,000
This is a transceiver, the forms you see around you, of the organisms, the microorganisms, the viruses, all these things.

153
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:02,000
The plants, the forests, the hyper structures of organismal synergy that we refer to with the term ecologies.

154
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:12,000
These are instancings of the forms and modes of cooperative transcendence throughout time space.

155
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Everything you could possibly imagine or want is directly accessible from right here,

156
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:28,000
your body, right where you're sitting. Nothing requires travel.

157
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And travel can quickly become ironic and, you know, productive of the opposite of what travel hopes for.

158
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
The gurus and yogis know what I am saying.

159
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:54,000
We imagine that when Buddha says, oh, I've remembered, I've had the anamnesis of my million previous lifetimes,

160
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:08,000
we presume that what he may have meant was a linear anamnesis backward in time.

161
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It occurs to no one, nearly no one, that what he meant was something more like all these lives here, all these lives alive now,

162
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
all these lives that have been previously alive. These are my spirit, they are my mind, they are my body.

163
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:41,000
They are my mother, they are my father, they are my children, they are my dreaming, they are my love.

164
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
What's actually going on here is, first of all, incomplete.

165
00:33:48,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So the language is wrong. There isn't anything actually going on because the idea that there are things that are actually the case is a result of that first fiction.

166
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:10,000
The transfer of the continuity of physical objects in space to all other domains of being. It's not true.

167
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Much of what is going on is not a state. It's an array of transforming potential synergistically producing the appearance of a stable situation.

168
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That appearance is false. It is another of the fictions, the appearance of a stable situation, not true.

169
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Deceptive, slave-making nonsense in consciousness. Useful for very pragmatic concerns and purposes.

170
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I want to build a bed out of wood. Useful. Stable state, mine. I want to shoot a bullet and kill my neighbor. Useful.

171
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I don't want that, but if somebody has this desire, right? Useful. Useful for war, useful for commerce, useful for allopathic medicine.

172
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:21,000
The kind we use doctors and hospitals to purvey. Useful for mechanistic science, engineering, computation, so forth.

173
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Lethal to our actual potentials in origin when implemented by dissociated insane processes that have captured our collectivity and expectation.

174
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So this is all the world. When a child is born here, it is just as if you gave them a UFO, right?

175
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It's just like the story of Superman where Carl L, knowing that his world is about to be destroyed by earthquakes due to transformations in the local and stellar environment,

176
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:12,000
puts his child, their child, into a spacecraft and sends it to Earth to grow and be born here. That is the story of every human child on this world.

177
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:26,000
We come from space-time. This planet is all the world. When a child is born here, what they will traverse in existence is very similar to...

178
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It's not similar. It's the hyperstasis. It's the superposition over what would happen in an actual spaceship sent to another planet that was inhabited by something, right?

179
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:54,000
This world is all the worlds. Your travel here is travel in space-time. It appears local. It isn't local.

180
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:03,000
There's nothing local about it. Or rather, the fragment of it which is reliably local is, again, perhaps... It's less than 1%.

181
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It's very reliable, that less than 1%. As far as expectation, ambiguity, and prediction goes, seems like it's made of concrete, that 1%.

182
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's super reliable, but wildly incomplete. And so, too, are the natures and potentials of our human lives which appear to be individual yet or not.

183
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:39,000
They are for the sake of all beings. We incarnate for the sake of all beings, as well as our own sake.

184
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:55,000
We come here on heroic missions that are quickly forgotten as we are indoctrinated in modernity's languages and in actions of enculturation.

185
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So, yeah, this is the fourth fiction. This is all the worlds. A lifetime here is a transit through space-time,

186
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:15,000
encountering many other worlds, many other universes, becoming other worlds and universes, together, within for each other, and the history and future of all beings.

187
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And the sake of their liberation from pain and suffering and impoverishment. It doesn't look that way on the surface. It looks like the opposite.

188
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:35,000
We come here to participate in pain, suffering, enslavement, and impoverishment of ourselves and others.

189
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:42,000
We torture the animals, we buy meat at the grocery store, all of these things. They are bad. Of course, they are bad.

190
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
For those of us that live in cities, they are sort of necessities, so the city starts the problem.

191
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:58,000
You can see that the problem begins at the collective level and is transmitted into the personal level, order, or register, if you will.

192
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:10,000
There's going to be some wind for a minute while I wander around this. Maybe I'll pause and reflect on the fifth fiction.

193
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Okay, the fifth fiction is that aggregates of human collectives are people. That the government is a person, that the corporations are persons.

194
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:35,000
There was a catastrophic data breach at AT&T recently, and I read nonsense language in the media.

195
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The privacy of our clients is our fundamental concern. We're filled with regret and so forth.

196
00:39:47,000 --> 00:40:00,000
We heard similar nonsense from Boeing, whose catastrophic commercial grifting and cheating resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people.

197
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:15,000
We hear the same nonsense from ExxonMobil when, you know, some pipeline bursts and vast portions of the ocean are obliterated by poison.

198
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:31,000
We hear this nonsense constantly. Trump pretends to be a human being with a political identity when, in fact, it's just a fucking parasite.

199
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It's a highly advanced parasite.

200
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And others will say, well, Biden's even worse. Okay, right. I doubt it, but it's, you know, it doesn't really matter.

201
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The point is, fictional humans aren't humans. Corporations can't have emotions. They don't have regret. They don't have compassion. They don't have altruism.

202
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Small groups of humans can express altruistic gestures as collectives.

203
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Small groups of humans can be human until they're captured by commerce or power in the market.

204
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And then it's basically just straight up monsters. Lying, right?

205
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But what I want to be really clear about is that representations of human collectivity that are dead inside cannot have emotions.

206
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And when they say we regret, they're just fucking lying. It's impossible for Google to regret something, right?

207
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It's impossible for them to feel shame. They don't have emotions.

208
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:51,000
When they say they're expressing emotions, they are lying, straight up lying. There's no such thing as that.

209
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Corporations are not people. They don't have rights. They can't be imprisoned.

210
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:08,000
There's no real structure to shut them down when they behave omnisidally or catastrophically or viciously, or just profiteeringly, right?

211
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I mean, everybody's just going to say, like, look, this is a war over profit. As long as we win the war, whatever you can get away with goes.

212
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And damn the graveyards of children. Who cares?

213
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Do you see the same kinds of thing going on in the countries that are at war right now?

214
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:34,000
They don't care about human beings at all. They have some principle or idea in mind, some protocol that they're enacting,

215
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:43,000
as they slaughter children and women and fathers and grandfathers and grandmothers and whole lineages of human history, just obliterating them.

216
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
They think they have an argument in favor of this? What possible argument could a human being have for that? None.

217
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
If they were human, they could not do that.

218
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So the idea that our collectives are intelligently oriented or humane or human or trustworthy or worthy of our service or attention or authorization is bullshit.

219
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:20,000
The fifth fiction.

220
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Now, there are many more fictions.

221
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
They all have to do with limitations.

222
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:37,000
That you're not telepathic. That you are telepathic. Both are fictions.

223
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:44,000
The actual path between them is intimacy, not declaration.

224
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Intimacy.

225
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Sensitive mutual synergy for noble and amnoetic, un-forgetting purposes to remember together.

226
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:07,000
To rediscover the potentials and natures of our origins and intelligences, our transcendent aspects.

227
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:16,000
The beyond of the human that we came here to bring into physical reality.

228
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:37,000
To catalyze, to impregnate, to fertilize, to potentiate here on Earth.

229
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
There are many more fictions.

230
00:44:43,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Now, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to take the fictions I presented here and invert them in your consciousness, evaluation, thought, behavior, relationships, experiments, arts, creativity, remembering, dreaming, adoring, awakening, experience.

231
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:18,000
If you know the falsehoods, you can forge the keys. And if you know two or three of them, you can forge a very powerful key.

232
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I've given you five here today. There are many more. We will continue to explore them together.

233
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:43,000
We were born to un-forget the ways and beauty and shining holy origins of our nature, potentials, and the missions that we incarnate to pursue together.

234
00:45:43,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Let us not forget them. Let us never counterfeit them. Let us correct wherever we begin to forge biases or declarative errors.

235
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Let us not know but learn. Let us not tell but see together for each other.

236
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:45,000
In any situation where we have the agreement to see better rather than to defend the books of our previous thought, concern, belief, and bias, wherever we shall agree to see better together for the sake of each other in our world, we will succeed.

237
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Our fiction is that we are alone in the universe. We are not alone here on earth, but we are nothing like alone in the universe.

238
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Our people were born in intimate symbiotic relationship with non-human intelligences.

239
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Those here around us on earth are perhaps first those in the sky that may have actually forged our forms, because we are certainly not the result of merely natural mechanical evolution on earth.

240
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
No chance of that.

241
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:30,000
The sixth fiction is that we are alone. And the seventh is that you are alone.

242
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:43,000
The universe is filled with anciently astonishing transcendent minds, and they participate directly in the formation of living worlds.

243
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Without them, you would not be able to understand my language. You would not have anything like a mind.

244
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:57,000
In order to have a mind, you have to be touching the basis of the transcendent origin of consciousness.

245
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And that's a link that could never be broken. Never.

246
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It might perhaps be briefly interrupted. If it were interrupted for long, everything that you understand as you would permanently be gone.

247
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
And I don't think that's even possible.

248
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:21,000
So, the sixth fiction is that humans are alone. The seventh is that you are alone. There's no chance of that.

249
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:31,000
The eighth is that we're the dominant form of life on earth. We are certainly the most dangerous and lethal form of life on earth.

250
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And in the sense of being omniscidally dissociated from lived relation with nature, if that's what dominance means, then we're dominant in that sense.

251
00:48:50,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And we are dominant in the sense that we can destroy everything here without too much trouble.

252
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:19,000
But we are not the dominant form of life. The dominant form of life is probably cells, bacteria, protozoa, single-celled animals, protists, and so forth.

253
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And in terms of number, the dominant form of life is probably viruses.

254
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So these are the fictions I will outline today. I hope you find them useful and medicinal.

255
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Insightful and helpful. Inspiring.

256
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:56,000
When learning to see them, we can begin to forge their opposites in thought, concern, consciousness, relation, and behavior.

257
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And that direction lies the hope of the future of our species and world.

258
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I'm so grateful to have this time together. Thank you for joining me.

259
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Take a moment to like or share or ask a question in the comments. Please support my work if you find it helpful or amusing, inspiring.

260
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I look forward to learning together again very soon. May your ways and lives and dreams and relations be beautiful and profound.

261
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Bye-bye for now.
