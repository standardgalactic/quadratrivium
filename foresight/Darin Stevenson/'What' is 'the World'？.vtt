00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello everybody. Welcome.

00:10.000 --> 00:24.000
So grateful to have this time together while we are all still alive here on Earth.

00:24.000 --> 00:52.000
A planet that I profoundly adore and deeply believe in the beingness of, you know,

00:52.000 --> 01:08.000
the idea that Earth is a being is probably both very old and also not as universal as

01:08.000 --> 01:20.000
we might imagine. It's hawk time here.

01:20.000 --> 01:42.000
Hawkeye in the sky circling in another one or two. One in a tree being harassed by a stellar's jay in an example of an ancient symbiosis, not merely enmity.

01:42.000 --> 02:00.000
Hawk is not merely the enemy of the Corvid because they inform each other's intelligences and developmental arcs, evolutionary arcs.

02:00.000 --> 02:28.000
What may superficially appear to be enmity or competition, you know, is never merely the one valued delusion

02:28.000 --> 02:43.000
that language and modern human culture are likely to presume, suppose, impose on our thought through various games in language and so forth.

02:43.000 --> 03:03.000
In fact, all relationships and all subjects of nomenclature, all, they called, it'll come to me, all nomenada.

03:03.000 --> 03:17.000
Nomenada are those things toward which language points our attention, concern, or capacity to distinguish.

03:17.000 --> 03:46.000
And that English part has a lot in common with the idea of extinguishing and what gets extinguished. The unity and the infinite valued situation that we find ourselves in when considering in consciousness the identities or properties or qualities of beings,

03:46.000 --> 04:15.000
circumstances and relationships. We should learn and remind each other to be extremely suspicious of any one valued kind of polemic or dialectic.

04:15.000 --> 04:37.000
The idea that that is a tree and that is only a tree is ridiculous, insulting, stupidifying.

04:38.000 --> 04:47.000
The woman was saying, where we're going, where we're going, you have a choice. And then she began to enumerate the different restaurants.

04:47.000 --> 05:07.000
But notice how she said, I noticed, how she said, you have a choice, the singular, you have a choice. As if, you know, you either have a choice or no choice.

05:07.000 --> 05:36.000
And so if you don't have no choices, you have a choice. And this is one of the common debilitating identity games that underlie English and that get imported into consciousness smuggled in when we learn English in the milieu of

05:37.000 --> 05:59.000
native speakers of this language, which is not merely colonial and colonizing, yet has these qualities and histories associated with it.

05:59.000 --> 06:18.000
So back to the earth as a being, you know, some indigenous, for example, some, for example, indigenous cultures do not see the earth as a being.

06:18.000 --> 06:45.000
And it's not clear which cultures were aware of the idea of a planet at all, and when this idea may have arisen in any culture we may direct our attention towards.

06:46.000 --> 06:56.000
It does seem a multibird goose attack.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
The male is angry.

06:59.000 --> 07:15.000
The neck is all craned over and he's ready to do the I'm going to bite you bit to the other words.

07:15.000 --> 07:25.000
And this one appears to have possibly suffered some kind of a neck attack, but maybe not.

07:25.000 --> 07:37.000
So, you know, we have these weird ideas and they seem entirely ordinary to us, at least since Galileo.

07:37.000 --> 07:51.000
The idea that this is a solar system in a galaxy in a universe that space is mostly empty, that planets are objects, not beings.

07:51.000 --> 08:11.000
When in fact, more than likely, the, not more than likely, almost certainly, the planets are not merely not inert and they are not merely beings.

08:12.000 --> 08:39.000
They are, perhaps, and I think it's very likely, they are transcendental forms of which the physical aspect is the minimal component of the form, much like humans and what we think of as souls or our spirits.

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
You know, as a regular everyday human being, your body seems to be what you are. You are your body.

08:46.000 --> 09:06.000
And so, you experience threats to your body as if they are threats to you, fundamentally, because you don't have an experience, maybe you don't have an experience, of being but not being your body.

09:06.000 --> 09:18.000
I remember seeing a cartoon yesterday of someone sitting up in bed and the cartoon was entitled, In the Body Experience.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
Instead of out of body, in of body experience.

09:25.000 --> 09:43.000
But you know, many of us have had the experience of being outside our body, of having our perspective and perception located in space distinctly from where our body is.

09:43.000 --> 10:02.000
Very common that this turns out, relatively common, that this turns out to be the upper left hand corner of the room as it might be perceived relational to our body.

10:02.000 --> 10:13.000
And that upper left thing is kind of interesting, because it implies right hemispheric stuff going on.

10:13.000 --> 10:25.000
Now, some people will say, particularly materialists, physicalists, especially eliminative materialists, that that's just an illusion.

10:25.000 --> 10:38.000
But such people will also say that the mind with which they are forming that conclusion is illusory, not understanding that their argument undermines their argument.

10:38.000 --> 11:02.000
And if your mind is merely an illusion, and if illusions are that which is not real or does not correspond to reality in some way, is not veritical, then there's no reason to impose validity on any assertion that can be made by such a mind,

11:02.000 --> 11:14.000
including the assertion that the mind is illusory, or consciousness is illusory, or an epiphenomenon of brain function, or etc., etc., etc.

11:14.000 --> 11:33.000
Many ridiculous arguments suffer from declarative self-inclusion, where if the argument is taken seriously, it naturally undermines itself according to the principles of set theory,

11:33.000 --> 11:48.000
because by including its origin in the proclamation, i.e. minds are just an illusion, well, the thing that you're making the statement with and the thing you're interpreting the statement with,

11:48.000 --> 12:00.000
not to mention the thing that causes you to believe the statement to be valid, you've just rendered all of these untrustworthy in a fundamental way.

12:00.000 --> 12:19.000
So, you know, I can imagine, to go back to the Earth as a being thing, it's not clear who knew ideas about planets and stars and so forth,

12:19.000 --> 12:34.000
and when some people or group or culture or cohort knew these things in terms of the developmental history of our species,

12:34.000 --> 12:56.000
everyone probably had an idea of home. This is the world, quote-unquote, but that didn't necessarily mean a planet, and this is our world, the territory between these three mountains and those two rivers, for example,

12:56.000 --> 13:15.000
inclusive of this, that, and the other thing, this is our home, and, you know, most of the humans thought, it seems, many of them anyway, that they were the original people,

13:15.000 --> 13:35.000
so we are not a people, and the article matters here, we are the people, we are the people, and this is clear from anthropological research,

13:35.000 --> 13:54.000
which is not always accurate and is often misconstrued by those researchers that compose the perspectives and write about them for, you know, academic purposes and so forth.

13:54.000 --> 14:14.000
Yeah, these matters are very murky. What is a world? Did they understand planets? It seems very clear that people like the Dogon who appear to have had contact with some form of non-human intelligence were aware that there are planets and that this is a planet,

14:14.000 --> 14:40.000
and there were stars, and that a particular star was the home of sky people, and they knew essentially impossible things about that star, for example, they knew, I believe, that it was a binary, which is impossible to detect without, you know,

14:41.000 --> 14:58.000
really advanced mathematical knowledge and telescopes and things, they knew that the star had a planet, which is impossible to detect, I think, so there were ancient peoples who might have been aware of the idea of a planet,

14:58.000 --> 15:25.000
but what it meant to them is very difficult to understand, and it seems impossible that it could have meant what we think of as a planet. In fact, it's similarly impossible that they would imagine space or space time in the abstract way we do,

15:26.000 --> 15:41.000
thinking of it, for example, as a vacuum populated by a variety of celestial objects, i.e. things, right?

15:42.000 --> 16:08.000
So, we'd have to go sort of people by people and time by time to gain any reasonable understanding, and even then it would be difficult, especially if there were no written records, we would only have their traditional knowledge to depend on, which in some cases is relatively reliable and a few thousand years old,

16:09.000 --> 16:20.000
and in other cases is not very reliable, and in some other cases is much older, 20, you know, 10, 20 thousand years old.

16:20.000 --> 16:45.000
So, it would be very difficult to understand what they thought about stars and planets, and it's probably not true that they were animists in the senses that we think about animism.

16:50.000 --> 17:19.000
Because for us animism is a weird thing, it's like you get rid of the qualities of being in beings and situations and circumstances and so forth, you throw that all away, and you re-add it in a sort of panpsychic gesture.

17:21.000 --> 17:37.000
So, because we start out from the abstract and we re-add it, there would be impossible for these older peoples to have thought abstractly about beings' places.

17:38.000 --> 17:54.000
Mountains were not necessarily gods, but in nearly no case was it possible that they weren't, they didn't have at least the status of beings, and probably the status of something we don't have a category for.

17:55.000 --> 18:02.000
And this is the category that I use the word transcendentience to point at.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
It is more than a being, it is a progenitor of beings.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
Without this there is no beings, without this there are no minds.

18:12.000 --> 18:34.000
The sun and the world clearly belong to this class, we don't really have, the only category we really have in English that points this way, that nominates the sun and the moon and the earth to such a status would be god, a god.

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
And so we have these weird ideas of like Gaia and stuff.

18:39.000 --> 19:03.000
But these ideas mostly only come to us, not necessarily from ancient peoples, from modern anthropologists painting things onto perspectives they were exposed to in living with and communicating with older peoples, indigenous peoples.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
And so forth.

19:07.000 --> 19:17.000
And so it's very difficult for us moderns, especially those of us who speak English and don't speak an indigenous language.

19:17.000 --> 19:24.000
That duck tried to eat the butterfly, that's hilarious.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
I don't know why that's hilarious, I just find it hilarious.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
It's not innately hilarious.

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
It just reminds me of certain comic strips.

19:37.000 --> 19:46.000
So yeah, we unfortunately come, we learn about a world of things through the language that we speak.

19:46.000 --> 20:04.000
And initially these things are deprived of beingness, of originness, of uniterity, of ultimacy, right, ultimacy.

20:04.000 --> 20:15.000
Meaning not merely ordinary, not a thing, can't be a thing, unthingness.

20:16.000 --> 20:25.000
Prioritized above all language concepts and so forth, ultimacy.

20:25.000 --> 20:44.000
And uniterity meaning not a separate subject of discernment or distinguishing, but rather an instance of the entire history and future of everything.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
An instance.

20:47.000 --> 21:07.000
I think Alan Watts once said something resembling in the same way an apple tree could be said to verb, right, it apples.

21:07.000 --> 21:14.000
Meaning the constant production and appalling of the tree.

21:14.000 --> 21:30.000
In the same way the apple tree apples, the world persons, right, the world just produces these myriad forms of beings, including apple trees.

21:30.000 --> 21:46.000
As an expression of its own nature, history, origin, purpose of expression, and so forth.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
So what is the world?

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Well, it's not a what.

21:51.000 --> 22:07.000
One way to answer the question is, or one way to respond to the question is, without the world, izzings, izzesses, don't exist.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
There are no izzings.

22:09.000 --> 22:23.000
And izzings are being as this moment, present beingness, the doing of being by being.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
Clearly the waterfowl agree with me.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I think it's very obvious.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
They're like, yes, of course this is so.

22:33.000 --> 22:45.000
But the world is the precursor to the possibility of things like beings and minds and relationships and circumstances and so forth.

22:45.000 --> 22:57.000
And it's also the peculiar stage for what we refer to with the word consciousness, without very well understanding what that might mean or what we mean by that.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
Unless we suppose, see, this is the problem.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
In English, these things are additive.

23:05.000 --> 23:21.000
It is as if when we say you are conscious, we are adding a property to a container when nothing like that is even possibly going on, except in language.

23:21.000 --> 23:28.000
There's no chance that language is the possession of a container.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
No chance.

23:30.000 --> 23:55.000
If anything, it's the natural expression of communal origination, futurity, relation, in and as a localized exemplar of transcendent hyper-systems that produce things like

23:55.000 --> 24:15.000
time-space, galaxy stars, black holes, white holes, quasars, pulsars, nebula, moons, the keeper belt, ice chunks, comets, meteors, all of these celestial beings.

24:15.000 --> 24:41.000
So these are exemplars of an originary pulse that we refer to often as the primary miracle in science.

24:41.000 --> 24:50.000
In what? Cosmology, scientific cosmology.

24:50.000 --> 24:58.000
The miracle we call the, as if there's only one, big bang.

24:58.000 --> 25:04.000
Which implies some kind of, you know, just got soaked.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
Well, I got wet actually, not soaked.

25:09.000 --> 25:17.000
I don't know, for those of us, uh, periodically minded, it implies that something was having it on with something else and then it blew up.

25:17.000 --> 25:28.000
And then stars and, you know, time-space and all that, uh, comes out of the exgasm.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
Yeah, that's the Give Me One Miracle branch of cosmology.

25:33.000 --> 25:39.000
Give me one miracle and I'll explain everything else.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
The thing about science though is that it's not fundamentally explanatory.

25:44.000 --> 25:49.000
It's fundamentally utilitarian for most human purposes.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
There are exceptions.

25:52.000 --> 26:06.000
And by utilitarian, I mean it forges theories, puts those theories in combat against each other in a kind of rock, paper, scissors thing.

26:06.000 --> 26:18.000
And then the ones that win propagate and then we make machines to both test and implement physical observations.

26:18.000 --> 26:25.000
And, uh, mostly, like, physics is a lot about prediction, right?

26:25.000 --> 26:32.000
What happens next, given x, y, and z, um, and some other variables?

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
What do they tell me how the system will evolve?

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
And the better your story about how it evolves, the more accurate we presume the theory to be.

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
Um, but I'm not really here to talk about that.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
So what is the world?

26:49.000 --> 27:03.000
Well, again, the question is kind of ridiculous because without the world there are no questions, right?

27:03.000 --> 27:13.000
So one of the things that is around here and for us is the moment-to-moment origin of the possibility of purposeful thought relation,

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
conception, nomenclature, theories, and so forth.

27:19.000 --> 27:29.000
You can see that it doesn't fit inside the category tree because the category tree doesn't exist without it.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
It's very similar with the sun.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
Let's take that thing away, poof, right?

27:35.000 --> 27:45.000
All human thought history experience, religion, math, science, art, insanity, war, everything, gone.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Poof, gone. Meaningless.

27:48.000 --> 28:04.000
So, um, obviously the sun must be held in an extremely specialized, uh, perspective, categorically,

28:04.000 --> 28:11.000
where it's an exemplar of supercategory, beyond categories.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
Because without it you don't get minds.

28:14.000 --> 28:21.000
Without minds, categories don't matter anymore.

28:21.000 --> 28:32.000
So this is why I think stars and planets and moons and things are transcendental.

28:32.000 --> 28:50.000
And I tend to, um, concern myself somewhat with what that means and how to better understand it, even conceptually.

28:50.000 --> 29:12.000
But the, the idea for me is that the idea that I usually play with here, I can play with others, is that one must preserve much like Gidellian incompleteness in mathematical systems.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Ha!

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
I just got wet again.

29:17.000 --> 29:36.000
One must preserve the super, super categorical character, necessity, of transcendentals, that by their existence create the possibility of thought.

29:36.000 --> 29:43.000
We mustn't subsume those into the conceptual systems in an ordinary fashion.

29:43.000 --> 29:54.000
Uh, especially if we are concerned about the verity of our rationales.

29:54.000 --> 30:11.000
Um, rational meaning to make parts of, uh, to both distinguish and connect, to denote and connotate these distinguishings and connections.

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
Of course the connotation thing is more like dreaming than logic.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
The denotation thing is more like logic than dreaming.

30:22.000 --> 30:34.000
So, for me, also what I wanted to say is that for some indigenous peoples, um, the sun and the earth were well known to be beings.

30:34.000 --> 30:46.000
For example, I suspect this is what my friend, Ryan Firstdiver, uh, who I strongly recommend you look up his YouTube channel.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Um, brilliant.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
One of the last remaining Blackfoot Beaver men.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Um, one of my closest friends.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
And, uh, one of my favorite teachers.

31:00.000 --> 31:07.000
By the way, don't be fooled by Ryan's external cultural costume.

31:07.000 --> 31:15.000
Um, you know, he may listen to rap music and, uh,

31:15.000 --> 31:23.000
scrap with, uh, the superficial culture and its icons and so forth.

31:23.000 --> 31:33.000
Inside that human being is a profoundly deep, uh, intelligence, a brilliant writer.

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
Um, one of the most heartful people I've ever known.

31:39.000 --> 31:45.000
Again, looks tough on the outside, soft as soft can be in his heart.

31:45.000 --> 31:56.000
Loves the animals, the living places, honors the old agreements to the best of his ability, rescues the animals from the humans.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
Um, very much a heroic being in my view.

32:02.000 --> 32:19.000
Ryan, I think would say that although the sun and the moon are understood in Blackfoot traditional culture as sky persons or something like this, persons of the sky.

32:19.000 --> 32:30.000
Um, as are the Morning Star and the Companion Star, the False Morning Star, which is what we call Jupiter.

32:30.000 --> 32:38.000
Uh, though those are sky people and they were here once.

32:38.000 --> 32:49.000
They've been, they've come down to the earth and they still come down to the earth to visit and communicate and transact with humans who get their attention.

32:49.000 --> 32:57.000
Um, and there are various ways to acquire their attention, which is also a fairly dangerous thing, you know, project to undertake.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
But although they are the sky people, the earth is like the Hogan, right?

33:02.000 --> 33:11.000
Or the, not necessarily the teepee, but like the communal home of the sun and the moon.

33:11.000 --> 33:23.000
Um, where perhaps, this is my own edition, don't quote me on this, uh, their children live, perhaps.

33:23.000 --> 33:31.000
Um, and there are old stories where they were here together on the earth.

33:31.000 --> 33:42.000
They had children, um, I believe seven particularly, which would be hard to not imagine corresponds to the planets.

33:43.000 --> 33:50.000
Um, all of those beings lived here in the traditional story.

33:50.000 --> 33:57.000
Um, the moon, uh, is, takes a lover.

33:57.000 --> 34:09.000
The sun becomes incensed, haha, what a pun, at this because the sun can smell, can smell the lover around the house.

34:09.000 --> 34:21.000
And then there's a huge fight, the moon goes insane and becomes a sort of like a banshee like monster that is chasing them.

34:21.000 --> 34:35.000
And the sun gives each of the children a pouch in which there is a power of protection and the sun, I mean, the moon hunts them.

34:35.000 --> 34:40.000
This is a very abbreviated version of the story.

34:40.000 --> 35:00.000
Uh, eventually there's a sort of day-in-a-maw, I think, a climax where the sun, or one of the children, I can't remember, cuts off one of the moon's legs.

35:00.000 --> 35:15.000
And the moon bleeds, and then the moon goes up into the sky, and this is a explanatory figure,

35:15.000 --> 35:29.000
or ceremonial, you know, traditional story figure that explains the moon's, um, cycling, right?

35:29.000 --> 35:40.000
Uh, what's going on is that the leg is being cut off and then regrown, uh, over the lunar cycle.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
Then of course they all go back up into the sky.

35:44.000 --> 35:52.000
Now, the thing that is clear is that those planets are not objects, and the moon is not an object.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
It's unclear what category they belong to.

35:56.000 --> 36:08.000
It isn't gods, but it's certainly both inclusive of humanity and transcendental to it at the same time.

36:09.000 --> 36:27.000
As I understand from Ryan, the Blackfoot people generally, traditionally, do not believe in the idea of the transmigration of souls or the existence of souls.

36:27.000 --> 36:35.000
Um, there is sort of such a thing as a ghost, in a way, but it's not the same concept.

36:35.000 --> 36:46.000
In fact, the whole foundation of categories and concepts in Blackfoot is fundamentally different,

36:46.000 --> 37:04.000
and one might even say, in a sense, not translatable to the western, uh, templates of identity, um, abstraction, function, role, circumstance, situation,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
relationship, and so forth.

37:06.000 --> 37:15.000
For one thing, uh, it seems to me from what I've learned that, and I'm happy to be corrected about any of this, by the way,

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
I'm not an expert on any of these matters.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I've just been lucky enough.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
I'm like a kid who got some mud splashed on him, right?

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
And I'm like, oh, this mud is very interesting, right?

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
But I don't really know.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
I didn't grow up in the mud, um, so to speak.

37:33.000 --> 37:41.000
Uh, but, you know, like, identity is rarely explicit, uh, in Blackfoot traditional culture,

37:41.000 --> 37:54.000
because we don't know moment to moment whether the appearance of someone or something is the most important feature to attend.

37:54.000 --> 38:01.000
So, I may see someone coming from far off, ah, there is a being, I might say.

38:01.000 --> 38:08.000
As they get closer, I may see certain signs that they belong to a specific people or place.

38:08.000 --> 38:17.000
Ah, they are a, uh, a blood tribe man appearing on a horse, appearing, right?

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
But that's not necessarily that I know it's a blood tribe man.

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
All I know is that there are signs that it's a blood tribe man,

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
because that could be the sun, that could be anyone.

38:32.000 --> 38:41.000
It depends sort of on who they come from, like, who is being represented by the being who is coming.

38:41.000 --> 38:48.000
And as they approach closer and closer, there are different linguistic forms to treat with the situation.

38:48.000 --> 38:56.000
As we get closer to something resembling, uh, denotative identity.

38:56.000 --> 39:10.000
Ah, this is indeed, you know, uh, the man whose indigenous name is thus and such,

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
or the woman whose indigenous name is thus and such.

39:13.000 --> 39:21.000
It is indeed that she represents, you know, her people and her tribe and herself.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
But it's possible for there to be lots of other outcomes.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
And this is something that in English is not understood.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
When we see Joe, we think, oh, that's Joe, end of story.

39:33.000 --> 39:39.000
Which really almost can't be true, because there are so many phase states of Joe,

39:39.000 --> 39:48.000
and so many purposes for which Joe might be here, or not here, or arriving, or departing,

39:48.000 --> 39:54.000
or all of these things that we don't pay much attention to in terms of identity in English.

39:54.000 --> 40:03.000
And we should, because they are crucial features of understanding role, identity, relationship, origin, future,

40:03.000 --> 40:12.000
futureity, ultimacy, all of these things, right?

40:12.000 --> 40:20.000
You know, I heard a story, uh, that was claimed, and you know, once again, it's not my,

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
it's not my goal here to say, oh, this is a true story, or this is not a true story.

40:24.000 --> 40:31.000
What I am saying here is that in the sense of theoria, a useful story, a useful perspective,

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
this perspective is useful.

40:34.000 --> 40:40.000
I heard a story where a man claimed to have been working at a secret government installation.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
He had disguised his voice to tell this story.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
I have also heard that this story was somehow debunked.

40:48.000 --> 40:53.000
I don't care. I don't care, because I'm not trying to tell the truth.

40:53.000 --> 40:59.000
I'm trying to illumine a perspective that I think is important and useful.

40:59.000 --> 41:08.000
So in this story, um, it was claimed that each of the planets that we know of,

41:08.000 --> 41:15.000
that we exist in a specific layer of a multi-layered reality.

41:15.000 --> 41:23.000
And in our layer, the earth, is the primarily inhabited planet,

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
the, um, biorelational hyperstructure in the solar system.

41:27.000 --> 41:35.000
Um, it was not clear whether the other planets presently have life or not,

41:35.000 --> 41:44.000
but it was claimed that in other, there's a layer in which every planet in the solar system is inhabited.

41:44.000 --> 41:49.000
Uh, and from this one, it looks like earth is the only one.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
There are layers in which the earth is not inhabited, and the other planet,

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
another planet is inhabited, or another couple of planets are inhabited.

41:57.000 --> 42:04.000
Um, and not necessarily by life as we suppose it must exist.

42:04.000 --> 42:10.000
And this is a very interesting story, because I had been shown something similar to this.

42:10.000 --> 42:18.000
A perspective in which what looks like craters on worlds in this layer

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
are actually cities in other layers.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
Now this is very science fiction-y, and I'm not trying to claim it's true.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
I'm claiming that it's a useful perspective to entertain in consciousness.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
Um, why is it useful?

42:35.000 --> 42:45.000
Well, it draws into question the strange, unjustifiable certainties

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
that we are, that are imposed upon us.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
Uh, oh, that's really interesting.

42:52.000 --> 42:59.000
I was wondering what is underneath these radish plants,

42:59.000 --> 43:06.000
and what is underneath them are roots, not radishes.

43:06.000 --> 43:13.000
Um, you know, think about the difference between,

43:13.000 --> 43:18.000
think that you don't, you haven't seen people gardening or growing food, right?

43:18.000 --> 43:23.000
And you come across some plants,

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
and you look at the surface of the plants,

43:26.000 --> 43:35.000
and you see the leaves and the, you know, the stems and things.

43:35.000 --> 43:40.000
And you think, well, that doesn't look edible.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
You're probably right.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
It's not particularly edible and or nutritious.

43:46.000 --> 43:53.000
But then, under the ground, where you are not looking yet,

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
there are radishes and potatoes and carrot symptoms.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
And it is similar in reality, right?

44:13.000 --> 44:19.000
The superficial appearances and the expectations imposed on us in English

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
are not indicative of the character of nature or origin or reality,

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
whatever reality might mean.

44:25.000 --> 44:32.000
And that also presumes that, you know, I am disinclined personally

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
to believe that observation causes wave collapse

44:36.000 --> 44:40.000
and other seemingly ridiculous to me stories.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
I just don't believe it.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I think something's going on,

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
and something probably very fascinating is going on,

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
but it isn't that.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
I certainly also don't believe that if I turn away from a tree

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
and I'm not observing it directly, it's not there.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
No, there's no chance that that's going on, as far as I'm concerned.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
I'm willing to entertain the idea in discussion and so forth, of course.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
But do I think it's a reasonable or rational idea?

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Hell, no!

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
I have friends that think,

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
when you stop looking at things, they're not there anymore.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Well, that's kind of a problem,

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
because that would mean that you're a highly privileged observer.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
It would mean that your cells aren't observers,

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
simply because they don't have eyes.

45:30.000 --> 45:37.000
So your cells can't tell that the oven behind you is now missing from reality.

45:37.000 --> 45:42.000
And none of the insects or other animals or plants qualify as observers.

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
This is the problem I have with, like, if a tree falls in the forest,

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
there's no one there to hear it, it doesn't make sound.

45:49.000 --> 45:54.000
Forest is filled with living beings.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
Maybe the human concept of sound,

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
if there's no humans there,

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
it's unreasonable to say that

46:03.000 --> 46:11.000
the human concept of sound pertains to what then occurs.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
But forest is filled with living beings,

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
and I'm pretty sure they experience vibrations in the air,

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
and many of them have actual ears,

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
and all of them have cells that can detect vibration,

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
and some of them have specialized structures, like antennae and things like this,

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
that can detect all kinds of things, probably.

46:34.000 --> 46:39.000
So the idea that the human is the ultimately privileged observer

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
that causes wave collapse is fucking insane.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
I just don't believe it.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
And, you know, convince me, right?

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
If you want to have an argument about this,

46:52.000 --> 46:58.000
my one friend, Sebastian, I know, wants to argue about this with me.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
By all means, let's have an argument and we'll debate the problem.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
I think, again, you have the same problem as you have with statements

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
that encompass their own origin here.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
There's some kind of a recursion problem in this argument

47:16.000 --> 47:23.000
that I can find, but I need someone to make a relatively clear claim

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
that I can then refute first.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
I could do it myself, but that would be tedious

47:29.000 --> 47:37.000
and reminiscent of onanism, intellectual onanism.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
So what are the planets? What is time space?

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
Well, almost all the...

47:43.000 --> 47:49.000
I mean, this is a question that I've been in love with for a long, long time.

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
When ancient people looked at the sky, what did they experience?

47:53.000 --> 47:58.000
What did they think that was, if they thought it was something?

47:58.000 --> 48:04.000
And, you know, I would argue that probably they were far less conceptual than we are.

48:04.000 --> 48:09.000
So it's not like they're trying to think, what is that?

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
That's very conceptual.

48:11.000 --> 48:17.000
Rather, they're probably having an experience more like diving into water,

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
where suddenly when you look up at the night sky, the universe changes.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
You change, everything changes,

48:27.000 --> 48:37.000
and you are aware in a participatory sense of the nature of the sky,

48:37.000 --> 48:52.000
of its status as ultimate progen...

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I can't make this word.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I can't make this tense of the word.

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
Progenerative, right?

49:00.000 --> 49:06.000
It is that from which all things derive their being.

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
Parental or hyperparental.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
Filial. This is my family.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
And these are not thoughts.

49:16.000 --> 49:22.000
They are experienced viscerally, emotionally, cognitively,

49:22.000 --> 49:28.000
in a way not dissimilar to what happens when we dream, right?

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
The one thing you're not really doing much of when you're dreaming,

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
otherwise you're either going to wake up or become lucid, is thinking.

49:35.000 --> 49:40.000
You're experiencing the relationships, the situations, the exchanges,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
and so forth, the transformations.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
You're not thinking about them.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
If you start thinking about them, you're going to wake up.

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
And if you think about them very gently, you will then realize you are dreaming.

49:50.000 --> 49:58.000
As I did the other night when I found myself in my dad's father's garage,

49:59.000 --> 50:06.000
and I knew that this was impossible because the house has been sold,

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
and those objects that I were seeing had all been disposed of,

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
I knew like, okay, right now I'm seeing something that it can't be true.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
It can't be there.

50:17.000 --> 50:23.000
I'm definitely not seeing where I am, right?

50:24.000 --> 50:30.000
And so what I suspect very strongly, and I think that this experience

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
is directly accessible to us,

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
is that when the ancients looked at the sky,

50:37.000 --> 50:42.000
it was a bit like diving into the water of originary transcendentians.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
And this is why they revered it.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
I live in two-nose hotels, a warm cafe.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
He knows everywhere.

50:49.000 --> 50:58.000
I love it when I see, I mean, I guess I just love being itself,

50:58.000 --> 51:04.000
but I love the animated, when I see animated enthusiastic conversation

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
among human companions.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
So yeah, I think when they looked up, they left the world.

51:11.000 --> 51:17.000
They had a participatory experience of a transcendental kind of a living water.

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
And it wasn't an accident that they likened the sky to an ocean.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
That wasn't superstition.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
It's true.

51:26.000 --> 51:32.000
If you just go upscale one scale, like one ladder rung from the world,

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
the sky is transcendental.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
It is like water.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
It's filled with islands.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
There are stars.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
There are planets.

51:44.000 --> 51:49.000
But you don't have to know anything abstract at all.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
You don't have to know those are stars and planets.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
You don't need any of that.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
You can actually just dive into the water.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
And I've had experiences that border on this when I was very young

51:59.000 --> 52:04.000
and I looked up at the sky before I had been trained to think abstractly

52:04.000 --> 52:12.000
about what up means, what is up, what the sky is, what space is,

52:12.000 --> 52:18.000
what planets and stars are, what celestial phenomena are.

52:23.000 --> 52:29.000
I'm watching a turtle swimming in a pond with some carp

52:29.000 --> 52:34.000
that they're all sunning themselves in the heat of the day.

52:35.000 --> 52:43.000
And I strongly suspect that space time is much more like this lake

52:43.000 --> 52:48.000
than a void populated with objects.

52:48.000 --> 52:58.000
It is a transcendental medium populated with transcendental phenomena.

52:58.000 --> 53:03.000
And in case you don't believe me, just take a look at the photographs of that stuff.

53:03.000 --> 53:08.000
Take a look at Jupiter. Does that look like an ordinary thing to you?

53:08.000 --> 53:14.000
Take a look at the star birth nebula or the crab nebula or the butterfly nebula

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
or a quasar or a pulsar.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
You think those are ordinary material phenomena?

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
Really? Where did you get that idea?

53:23.000 --> 53:29.000
Because they sure don't look that way to me and neither does the moon nor the sun.

53:30.000 --> 53:40.000
I admit that the moon looks desert-like and bereft of what we would think of

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
as vitalistic phenomena.

53:43.000 --> 53:50.000
It kind of looks like, what it actually reminds me of is something like

53:50.000 --> 53:58.000
the idea of the extremely elder, brilliant, rich crone.

53:58.000 --> 54:04.000
But I definitely do think of the moon as feminine and the sun as masculine.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
I'm capable of inverting those perspectives.

54:07.000 --> 54:14.000
And I know that there are cohorts of moderns who would want to take me to task

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
for thinking that there's anything like binary gender.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
Be my guest. Let's have at it.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
I'm going to stay on the side of binary gender.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
And beyond that, again, this isn't one thing mined

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
because I don't think there's merely binary gender.

54:31.000 --> 54:37.000
I just think that conceptually, symbolically, and metaphysically,

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
the concept of binary gender is crucially important

54:41.000 --> 54:48.000
and not to be disposed of for political or ideological purposes.

54:48.000 --> 54:53.000
Expanded? Sure.

54:53.000 --> 54:59.000
Possibly even contradicted for specific purposes.

54:59.000 --> 55:09.000
But, yeah, I want, in my cosmology, binary gender is actual.

55:09.000 --> 55:15.000
It's not the only game in town, but it's real enough.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
And again, you know, in...

55:27.000 --> 55:35.000
Alright, somebody's counting and it's fucking up my mind.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
We can have a number of different templates,

55:37.000 --> 55:42.000
but I'm not going to dispose of the one that seems to me foundational.

55:42.000 --> 55:47.000
And in Blackfoot, I would be surprised

55:47.000 --> 55:53.000
if the concept of gender is merely binary.

55:53.000 --> 55:59.000
I did have some discussions with Ryan about this a long time ago.

55:59.000 --> 56:04.000
I think there's an essay on my medium page regarding this.

56:05.000 --> 56:13.000
But it's not my goal to explore that particular topic here.

56:13.000 --> 56:21.000
Rather, I'm trying to say something about the character...

56:21.000 --> 56:35.000
My experience of the character and influence and profundity,

56:35.000 --> 56:41.000
and perhaps even fissundity of the moon,

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
which I do think of as feminine, and I also think of the Earth as feminine.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
You know, if you ask me, like, well, why would you do that?

56:48.000 --> 56:52.000
Because the Earth appears to generate children.

56:52.000 --> 57:00.000
And in my private cosmology, which I'm not trying to convince anyone of,

57:00.000 --> 57:07.000
I'm not asking anyone else to believe or think the same way I do about these topics.

57:07.000 --> 57:16.000
If it's useful, entertain it. If it's not, do as you will.

57:16.000 --> 57:22.000
So the Earth is sort of, in my weird cosmology,

57:22.000 --> 57:38.000
an ever-virginal mother that generates infinite kinds of children

57:38.000 --> 57:43.000
by the magical fertilization of the sun and time space.

57:43.000 --> 57:51.000
So it lives in a kind of ocean, floats in the ocean, like a big bathtub,

57:51.000 --> 57:57.000
orbited by the moon, who is sort of a fairy godmother in this cosmology,

57:57.000 --> 58:02.000
and we can have more than one.

58:02.000 --> 58:10.000
Fertilized by the rays of light originating in the sun,

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
which actually probably originates somewhere else than the sun,

58:14.000 --> 58:36.000
and the sun is an expression of this property or potential of originary and fertilizing power.

58:36.000 --> 58:43.000
Again, I'm not asking anyone to adopt my cosmology,

58:43.000 --> 58:52.000
but this is how I usually prefer to think unless I am entertaining

58:52.000 --> 59:01.000
another perspective for purposes of conversation or exploration.

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
And look, I didn't invent this cosmology.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
This is a cosmology that was transmitted to me,

59:10.000 --> 59:18.000
and this is the reason why I find it compelling,

59:18.000 --> 59:23.000
because it wasn't invented by humans.

59:23.000 --> 59:29.000
It's a knowledge way that comes from non-humans.

59:29.000 --> 59:37.000
And it wasn't explicitly delineated in the way language makes it sound.

59:37.000 --> 59:50.000
Rather, it was suggested as a useful perspective to entertain.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
So is the earth a thing?

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
Well, in language, okay, you know, you can think of it that way,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
it's going to be unfortunate, the repercussions that will happen if you believe that,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
that it's just an object.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:14.000
But, yeah, in English language, sure.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:26.000
As you approach the direction of conceptual correspondence with the real, the beautiful, or the true,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:33.000
it quickly becomes impossible that the earth is a thing.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
It becomes quickly impossible that the earth is not at least a being,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
and probably something transcendental to beings,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
that produces beings perhaps as a kind of side effect

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
of its nature, identity, relations, and activity

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000
in a multi-layered universe that's quite different

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:01.000
from our relatively mechanistic suppositions about time and space.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Because in the actual universe, everything is more than merely alive.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And we don't have, if there's a concept in English for more than merely alive,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I'd love to know what that is.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
The only word I can easily locate in my vocabulary is transcendental,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
but that doesn't tell you that it's more than merely alive.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And you can say the word spiritual, this just leads to a bunch of confusion,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:42.000
because there's this kind of weird property dualism that arises in the,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:52.000
in the sequelae of supposing that there are spirits or souls.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
And whatever's actually going on doesn't seem property dualistic to me.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I can't say what it does seem, primarily because our fucking catalog of categories

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:12.000
is missing fundamentally crucial position like tags.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:19.000
For example, a tag that means more than merely alive,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.000
pro-generative of beings' life and minds,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:35.000
actively holy, or actively divine,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
originary.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
We need, we need some placeholders for these kinds of things,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
these kinds of qualities, characteristics.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:53.000
But even the idea of characteristics, even the idea of language and its nominata

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
already inclines us to error,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.000
because the transcendental is beyond abstract reference.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
That's the problem, you know.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:15.000
If we had a category that implied to us that it was beyond,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
that the reference in this category are beyond abstract reference,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
you can see that there's already a problem,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
because now we're going to refer to them abstractly in language.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
We think we can encompass them if we just make the right shape of category.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Well, what if it's not true?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
What if there's some things that language just fails to point toward,

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
or misleads us when it does?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
What if the goal isn't to refer to things,

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:52.000
but to actually reacquire the direct experience of original participation,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:59.000
in the sense that Owen Barfield may have meant it,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.000
and in the sense that I was implying when I talked about what I strongly suspect happened

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:12.000
to ancient peoples when they looked at the sky, or a mountain, or a lake.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
They didn't see things.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:23.000
They immediately felt the transformation of their consciousness

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:33.000
in a transcendental way that lifted them above their mere humanity

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:41.000
into direct filial, memorial, and visceral participation.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
The same way as when you jump into a lake of water,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
or you slide down an ice sheaf,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:05:01.000
or you bungee jump into a crevasse.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000
This kind of thing.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
It is impossible.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:22.000
You can make face noises about the flavors of food.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Will you be able to taste the face noises?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
No.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:33.000
There might be unusual humans who have forms of sensorial memory,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:40.000
or if I suggest the word strawberry, they begin to taste it,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000
as if the memory of strawberry is in their mouth or something.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
But not me.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
You can talk about apples all you like.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I will not be able to taste the flavor of apples.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Can I be hypnotized or entranced to think I am tasting apples?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Possibly.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Will I actually taste them?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:17.000
It seems wildly unlikely to me.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
So I suspect that when the ancients looked up at the sky,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
and I have reason to suspect this, not just from thought,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
not just theorizing, but from my own direct experience,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
when they looked at the sky,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:38.000
it was like diving into an immediate relationship

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.000
with the spirit of time-space, origin.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
And so they did not so much have superstitions.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Their religions were not superstitious.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.000
What their religions were doing, the Egyptians and the Aztecs

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
and people who came before them,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:11.000
what they were doing is they were making images

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:18.000
of beings and situations they directly knew participatorially

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
in their relationships with the world,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:29.000
the sky, origin, the sun, the moon, the planets.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Much as a solo diver, for example,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:44.000
might represent dolphins, whales, octopuses, coral reefs,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:53.000
shellfish, crayfish, lobsters, clams, shrimp, cuttlefish, squid,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
fishes of every kind, sea anemones, sea urchins.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
When we look at the effusive,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:08.000
what we think of as symbolism of the Egyptians,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
rather than thinking, oh, they were very inventive,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
we should think perhaps they're actually telling us something

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.000
about their direct experience of the features of character

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
and relation they directly encountered

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.000
in exploring time-space by diving into it, participatorially,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
just as if they could rise up off the earth,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
just as if they could fall into the sky.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000
They could dive into the sky the same way we dive into the ocean.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000
And they didn't need spaceships because they had something better.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I mean, spaceships really suck.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:57.000
If you've got to have those, time-space is terrible for that.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
They had something better.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.000
They had what I would call a traveling body, which I believe we all have.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000
We're just trained not to think so and not to believe in it and so forth.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
And I think the traveling body was naturally awakened in them

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
when they gazed skyward.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
And so then, from that perspective,

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
they may have understood that earth was a planet,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:37.000
having looked back upon it from a disembodied traveling perspective

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
of a far above the earth.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
So I suspect that humans had seen the earth from space

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:53.000
long before the American astronauts or the Soviet astronauts went up there.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:59.000
And these are some of my thoughts on what is the earth

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000
and many related ideas.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Again, I'm so grateful

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:17.000
for our time together today and the fact that we're all still alive

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:25.000
and can attempt meaningful anemnesis about what it means to be human,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:32.000
to be alive, to participate in physical reality,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:45.000
and to think in new and hopefully liberating ways that result in education

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
rather than merely education.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Thank you for joining me.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I look forward to learning together again very soon.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Bye-bye for now.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
May your way be beautiful.
