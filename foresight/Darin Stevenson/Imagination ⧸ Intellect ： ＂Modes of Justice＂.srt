00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Hello everybody. Welcome. It is Saturday, 1st of June, 2024, the year when

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:58,680
schizogenic insanity was normalized when understanding became its opposite. Where ignorance and the polarity

3
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:15,260
of abject opinionated ignorance and the light of the origins of intelligence and insight

4
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:28,500
flipped over so that the former took the throne of the latter in our cultures and consciousness

5
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,540
and thought and language as I've been seeing many examples of today. And yet there are

6
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:53,720
bastions of insight and awareness, learning, discovery, growth, self-correction, and the mutual

7
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:04,240
encompassment of inquiry. Amen Hillman recently said something so right. He's like, you're not

8
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,000
going to believe me, bro, but this word history, it comes from a Greek root that means asking a

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:22,600
question of an oracle, an oracle, the living spirit of insight, divine wisdom embodied in a young

10
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:37,360
woman in ancient Greece, an oracle. History was a question, not a declaration, not a record of the

11
00:02:37,360 --> 00:03:06,080
authorized version of what had been a dream. I was listening this morning to messages

12
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:21,200
from my friend, Tim Sanderson, brilliantly embodied, soulful, heartful, more than human being. His

13
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:31,560
voice is so soft. And, you know, he complains that he was never really an intellectual, never truly an

14
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:43,920
academic, but was lost instead in the reveries of his fervent imaginings. I was like, the whole, you

15
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:52,680
know, 78% of the amphitheater of my ancestors stood up in their graves, like, yes, wild cheering ensued.

16
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:07,760
Though, you know, both paths, the intellect is profound when it's funded by its origins, when it

17
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:17,440
reveres its origins in dreaming and emotion and passion. And part of that passion is the quest

18
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:45,320
the quest for the superposition above the concept of justice. If the concept of justice means,

19
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:57,240
or is taken to mean, is clumsily and crudely taken to mean, a kind of accounting where transgressors

20
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:08,560
must be called to task and made to pay, because apparently wrongdoing is a banking system. This

21
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:19,680
sort of insanity, this, this branch on the upside down burning tree of ignorance, flagrantly

22
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:35,560
masquerading as propriety, purity is perennially horrifying. We see the results today in specific

23
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:50,320
conflicts, I will not hear name. We see this reenacted, devastating, nonsense masquerading as

24
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:59,080
justification, wherever that may happen. And it happens in me. I'm familiar with the stink of

25
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:06,000
this, the fingerprint, the poison, yeah, the poisoned fingerprint of my own thumb at the

26
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,280
beginning of some crime scene where I decide vengeance will be mine. Retribution will be the

27
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:28,520
spirit of the day, you know. And it's not that there's no place for that. Rather, its place should

28
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:43,480
be rare at best, at most, and funded by brilliant insight, not regimented ignorance, structured

29
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:59,600
into rules and laws and things. You know, the quest is for understanding exceptionally profuse

30
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:10,840
throat clearing, apparently. Honking in the interception. And throwing the children off the

31
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:22,080
bridge into the river to teach them to swim. Just had to get the little ones in there because,

32
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,720
you know, apparently everyone forgets they're alive or pretends that something else is going on.

33
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:38,800
Not everyone, but the collectives definitely. Just like children who cares, boom, guns, blow it up.

34
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:52,760
Destroy those mothers for the sake of some declaration. Bliterate them, blood and gore,

35
00:07:52,760 --> 00:08:03,160
fields of broken bones, chaos. Yeah, if that's the mark of sanity or intelligence among the humans,

36
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:11,800
then get me off this planet, please. Which, you know, for many sensitive and intelligent children is

37
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:21,200
the slogan they'd wear on their t-shirt. How could I have been born on a planet where the humans

38
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:28,200
treat each other like a lawn that just needs a good mowing? And yet, at the same time, there's

39
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:43,960
clearly some truth behind that delusion. The idea of harrowing that we find in certain

40
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:54,720
misconstrued biblical texts is nonetheless important. We do actually not eat the chaff of the wheat.

41
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:04,000
We eat the tender seed inside it and are thus nourished and our generations are rejuvenated by the

42
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,080
magic they're in. Meanwhile, the highly sensitive person sees the box of cream of wheat as cream of

43
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:22,280
wheat. The screaming of the plants as they're sited in the fields, back when we used to actually have

44
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:38,960
to manually harvest food for grain. Meanwhile, these people are feeding ducks bread, which, you know,

45
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,120
maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Pretty sure that those straight-up carbs are

46
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:54,280
poisoned to waterfowl, but these are city waterfowl, so who knows? And why should I trust my own biases

47
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:02,520
and judgments? The world is complicated. It's like a million spiderwebs intersecting and you try to,

48
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:12,640
what? Determine the value of the intersections via some combination of emotional valence and rational

49
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:23,040
thought. Okay. Hopefully the emotional valence is actually there and veritable and not just the

50
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,120
result of doubling down on previous biases and resentments and triggerings and so forth.

51
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:39,440
The dopamine ratchet, right? The neurochemical ratcheting that we undergo via media and spectacle

52
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:53,200
Facebook, Twitter. I mean, what a more ironic, you know, the collective mangling of intelligence

53
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:14,800
of many twits. A crowd of twits. Of course, there are brilliant voices in the morass. There are

54
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:22,160
those of us who, well, I counted myself among them. Did you see, see what I did there? There are those

55
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:34,200
of us who courageously and steadfastly hold the line in the cataclysm of ignorance and

56
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:49,680
opinionation we call social media today. I'm actually trying to understand that one of the

57
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:59,200
things that became clear to me when I listened to the dulcet tones of my friend Tim this morning

58
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,920
was just how that he doesn't stray from his embodiment when he speaks. And when he says I

59
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,120
couldn't, you know, I appreciated and sort of, he doesn't say I'm putting words in his mouth,

60
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,160
but he meant something that resembles I revered beautiful examples of intellectualism and

61
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,520
in academia, but I couldn't, I couldn't, I'm not, I'm not a library of Alexandria. I'm a dreamer.

62
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,920
And what's so beautiful about that is that comes to mind for me that I take from it is a couple

63
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:41,280
of things right away, a couple of things immediately. And the first is that the origin of the possibility

64
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,040
of memory and intelligence lies in dreaming dreaming.

65
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,480
It is the

66
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:04,240
the activity of angels in our minds that tend the gardens of memory so that they

67
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,040
flourish and thrive and blossom and fruit.

68
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:20,720
That imagination he speaks of is primordially fundamental. And there's no such thing as

69
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,640
intellect without it. So what he's really saying is in my view is I revere

70
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:39,680
the primordial origins from which the possibilities of intellect spring. I remain true to these.

71
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:50,080
I adore these. I belong to these, to them, to their spirit, to their action, to their bodies.

72
00:13:50,080 --> 00:14:00,640
I am theirs. They are mine. We are one. And that's profound. Beautiful. I agree. I contrasted myself.

73
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:10,480
I was like, after singing the praises of his failure to dissociate into his intellect,

74
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:21,680
I talked about my own weaknesses of such a form where

75
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:31,920
my intellect is like a UFO and I wake up in the morning and it's glowing there in the center

76
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:41,600
of the room. And I trace the sigils on the unbroken surface of this egg-shaped sphere.

77
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,320
A door appears with blinding light surrounding it.

78
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:56,080
It becomes a portal. I step in and, fume, I'm out of my body. I'm in wild, transcendental,

79
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:09,280
dissociative ecstasies far above my mundane soma, my flesh, my nervous system, my bones,

80
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:17,120
my organs. And they're like, wait, what just happened here? Darren is already dead?

81
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,840
Because that's sort of what's going on. I'm, in a way, untransported.

82
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:42,400
I'm in the spirit world before my passing. I'm seeing from after my death back into my life.

83
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:52,000
And it doesn't require drugs. It just requires ideas and language and my passionate fascination

84
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,320
with focus and my adoration of their mystery and horror and splendor and potential.

85
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:16,880
In a way, I long ago and without really the use of drugs. In fact, in the most sober

86
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:29,760
epochs of my life as a young adult and in my 30s, I knew the kisses of the muses.

87
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:40,240
And I didn't know what to call it, because this is the true state of blissful naivete,

88
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:52,960
where you haven't been separated from it. It hasn't been taken from you. So you have no way

89
00:16:52,960 --> 00:17:00,880
to refer to it, because there's no need to refer to it. It's not separate, right?

90
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:11,680
Right? The reference comes after the divorce, after the abstraction, after the loss, after the fall.

91
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,760
I mean, any of us who have sought wisdom, oh my god, what an ironic,

92
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:32,080
what an ironic situation we will find ourselves in. Any of us who have sought wisdom

93
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:43,840
and tasted of the nectars of her mouth. Thilo, so kissing, kissing. That saliva,

94
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:53,600
the trophallaxis, which is the transmission of hormones and nutrients among hymenoptera,

95
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:00,880
the ants, the bees, the wasps, often between species, not often, sometimes.

96
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,240
Right? Sometimes ants and wasps may exchange trophallactic

97
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,680
nectars, and they call them. There's no word in English.

98
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:27,120
They are trans-sigenic. They come before the generation of minds. They're primordial,

99
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:42,880
and there's nectars, elixirs, filters, P-H-I-L, T-R-E-S, I think. They're sometimes spelled, E-R-S.

100
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:52,160
Yeah, I was having congress with the muses before I understood they existed formally,

101
00:18:53,040 --> 00:19:01,760
before I knew how to speak of it, and they were reforging my mind and my dreaming,

102
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:14,880
resurrecting them moment to moment in my waking life, in my creative life, in my writing,

103
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,240
and my creative play, my music, literally music,

104
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,440
my quests.

105
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,080
And so, you know, I learned to kind of look down on ceremonial magic,

106
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:49,920
because there's feral enchantments that seem to me to far exceed the possibilities of structured

107
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:59,280
representation, ritual, and so forth. And when you have those, you would never trade them for

108
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,920
the bones of the thing.

109
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:16,320
But these days, that magic is much more rare than it was in my youth. And so,

110
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:31,520
I know, intimately, the body and wings of my intellect, and

111
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:42,080
I will gladly depart the graveyard of my waking mind for the skies beyond it.

112
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:53,120
Though I only fairly recently came to understand I was doing this, it was so natural, my trepidation

113
00:20:53,680 --> 00:21:01,520
of incarnate existence and somato-emotional

114
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,320
hystericity.

115
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:19,520
Yeah, like a layered archaia, a layered archaia of my

116
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:31,680
confusions, losses, injuries, sufferings, subjugations, enslavements,

117
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:43,760
all inflected, inflected with by, with and by the peculiarly weird

118
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:51,840
perspective from outside the personal, the

119
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:02,160
bizarre perspective that generates some of the branches on the trees of psychosis, paranoia,

120
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:13,840
self-criticism, the possibility of social critique, of public critique, of how others

121
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:25,920
might have seen me, of how the others of myself might direct the cruel illuminations of critical

122
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:36,880
judgment. And this is part of why I say that is not now and never shall be justice.

123
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:52,240
Condemnation and justice have nearly nothing in common. For justice, it seems to me, must be

124
00:22:52,240 --> 00:23:03,040
the, now I'm going to get in trouble here because I'm going to make structured language about

125
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:13,600
something that has to be fluidly transcendent in its natures and in actions. It must have a body

126
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,920
that isn't conceptual, that isn't linguistic.

127
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,280
All right, but I'll dare. I mean, it's the first part of my name, right? Dare in.

128
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:38,400
Don't get named this. If you want to get born as a human, don't go here. I was actually named

129
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:46,000
for Bobby Darin, a singer, one of Melodious Voice. And when I was little, I used to sing all the

130
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,120
time and my parents would constantly try to make me stop, but I was actually fairly good at it.

131
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,640
These days, I'm older and unpracticed, but I would love, I used to sing in a choir, singing is really,

132
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,400
that's so funny, a choir. In any case, where I'm going here is that

133
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:17,600
actual justice uses the problems that emerge in what we might think of as criminal behavior

134
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:27,520
that we would hold some individual god to account for. Okay, wow. Now, there's sort of at least

135
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:35,040
two different meanings of account here. One is to explain to us, right? Help us understand

136
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:43,280
your motivations. That's one kind of an account. But the other kind is we will

137
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,520
debit to you. We will debit your life. We will, we will subtract from you relationships, time,

138
00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:00,240
freedom, as if what we have in our modern societies even slightly resembles freedom.

139
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,040
But it does compared to being in a, you know, a stone box.

140
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,520
So yeah, this debiting, this accounting, which is

141
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:27,760
the very absence of humanity, intelligence, insight, awareness, justice, truth, the virtues.

142
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:37,920
It is a catastrophic abeyance of virtue and understanding.

143
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:43,120
So as I've said many times before,

144
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:00,160
what we ache for when injustice has taken place is not punishment.

145
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:15,760
We ache for the subtraction from the world of the forces, ideas, and situations, the traps

146
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:30,240
that led what we call the perpetrator to enact the quote crime,

147
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:38,720
unquote. And we've been confused

148
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,480
to desire further poison. We've been poisoned. The poison killed our heart.

149
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,680
And now we want to make a small poison and poison a million hearts. Poison the future,

150
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:01,680
poison history. Just lay waste

151
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:12,720
to the origins of our humanity, our souls, virtue, understanding, awareness. What we really want

152
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:24,480
is the context to be healed so that such crimes become not nearly unnecessary,

153
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:33,440
but impossible. Right? That's what justice looks like. It looks like using the intelligence we

154
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:42,880
can derive from the perpetrator as the symptom of something wrong in the water of our communal

155
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,720
identity or failure to establish it, to sustain it, truly.

156
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:05,200
Wow. These people are making floral reeds. I'm so jealous. It's awesome.

157
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:15,520
Oh my god, what's the, uh, is this a Greek symbol on the blanket? Sure looks like it.

158
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,000
It's amazing. They're actually being human together. It's fucking awesome. I love this.

159
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:38,880
By the way, you know, one form of justice is, doesn't concern itself with history at all.

160
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:46,320
It concerns itself with re-beautifying the present in such a way that the, that the integrity

161
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:55,280
and profound beauty of the future becomes repossibilized, right? Resurrected from its,

162
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:02,400
you know, cascade of falling off 19 different cliffs of vengeful stupidity and ignorance.

163
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:12,960
Yeah, that's what they're doing up there. That's celebration. I don't know the etymology

164
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,320
of the word justice or the word crime or perpetrator or celebration.

165
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:28,080
Um, I understand alphabetically some things about these words, but I'm not going to, uh,

166
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:37,600
descend into that labyrinth at the moment. Rather, I will stay in the path. But what those humans up

167
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:46,080
there are doing with their laughter, amituality and joyful, communality and floral, you know,

168
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,960
breathing each other's, literally their heads, right? They're breathing each other's heads with

169
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:02,080
flowers. Think about what this actually means, all right? It's very astonishing because on the one

170
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:12,400
hand they are breathing their heads with magical substances comprised over trillions and trillions

171
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:22,800
of lifetimes of these plants, without which we would not exist. So these plants are the progenitors.

172
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:29,920
In a sense, the fairies are, the fairies and the elves are the spirits of these plants and their

173
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:35,520
relationships and their histories with the land and the mountains and the skies and the waters. Okay?

174
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:48,480
Um, so they are breathing each other's heads just for a moment in joyful, mutual celebration

175
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,840
and promotion, right? They are raising each other up in the light of the sun on the top of the

176
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:02,640
Strawberry Hill in San Francisco, the place, you know, named after Francis of Assisi,

177
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:13,040
who probably actually was amazingly virtuous and brilliant and perhaps even wholly human being,

178
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:20,560
regardless of, you know, the fact, yeah, has nothing to do with the fact of the association,

179
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:28,000
the, the cohort, yeah, what, which cohorts we would associate him with and why, right? I mean,

180
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,920
it could have a little to do with it, but yeah, it's just, so yeah, they're up there

181
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:43,280
breathing each other's heads and drinking wine and celebrating and laughing and loving each other

182
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,320
and being human together. Wow, what a healing moment and notice that it's not

183
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:57,360
formal, it's not a ritual that they're enacting. It's spontaneous, it's improvised

184
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,160
and, you know, it's probably someone's birthday or maybe someone was just married or maybe someone

185
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:12,880
had a child or maybe they were just like, hey, you know, it's Saturday, it's Saturn,

186
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:26,640
it's the day of Saturn, that S, S-T-R, right? Sigma Tau Rho, as Amu would say, yeah, Sigma Tau Rho.

187
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:37,920
Yeah, so beautiful and inspiring and evocative of memory. They are breathing each other's

188
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:47,040
foreheads with flowers and one of them knows how to do this in an expert way. They have probably

189
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:55,680
hemp vines or strings that are being soaked in a liquid to make them especially pliable

190
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:04,080
and they had just baskets of flowers to weave into the vines. So brilliant.

191
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,960
So one of the kinds of justice is that we go forward from here in remembrance of mutual beauty

192
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:24,080
and origin. Think about that, right? No historical damnations, indictments, because think about

193
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:31,440
this. If you have to preserve the history of wrongdoing as you walk forward into life and

194
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,560
the potentials of your more than merely human life, if you have to preserve all those indictments and

195
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:47,920
you know, equivocate over them and punish them and wow, the problem with that is there are certain

196
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:56,000
kinds of burden that get heavier by a matter of, you know, geometric expansion, right? Like

197
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:06,640
exponential, they get exponentially heavier each moment that you continue to preserve them.

198
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:15,360
And we don't notice this because the urge to preserve them is one of the lethal games that

199
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:21,840
smuggled into our consciousness along with the process, you know, during the processes of

200
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:27,680
in-languaging and in-culturation as children. We think that English comes with no baggage.

201
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,360
Nothing like that is even possibly true. The opposite is true. There are, you know,

202
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,200
there are vast warehouses of lethal

203
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,640
tropes, right? Figures of speech, metaphor, simile.

204
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:07,120
I was trying to think of some, but I'm not, I'm not dwelling in the warehouses at the moment.

205
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,400
I'm dwelling above them, so it's hard for me to dip down and grab exemplars.

206
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:24,800
All kinds of courtroom mine tropes,

207
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:34,720
war mine tropes, vengeance tropes, but just think of how

208
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,520
metabolically, energetically, and spiritually expensive it is to preserve harms. And some will

209
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:50,160
say, well, you can't just ignore them. Okay, maybe, maybe, sometimes. But actually, you can do this

210
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,000
thing that's transcendentally useful, which is not to take offense in the first place.

211
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,240
And if you've noticed you've taken offense, you're going to have to carry that. You sure you want

212
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,360
that? Do you go to the store ever? Did you ever once go to the mall or the grocery store and find

213
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,760
the most disgusting, heaviest thing you could find, right? A box of rotten, dead rat corpses or

214
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,640
something, right? Huge box, weighs like three tons, and you carry that thing home and you drag it

215
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,960
along with you for the rest of your, not once, ever did you do this, right? So why do we do this

216
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,280
psycho-emotionally? Why do we decide to take offense? It's the most expensive thing you could take,

217
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,440
and it grows catastrophically more expensive the longer you preserve it.

218
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:43,840
And I hear, you know, in the background, the voices of those of us who have suffered actual

219
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:50,880
indignities and catastrophic harms or rape or, you know, horrifying violence or murder.

220
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,440
I hear their voices saying, what shall we just forget it? No. But what are we going to do with it?

221
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,120
What will we make of it? The fact that I got,

222
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,400
the fact that something that happened to me was horrifyingly bad. I mean, recently something

223
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:20,000
happened that I definitely took offense to. A doctor, specifically a doctor at Ocean Park Health

224
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:29,120
Center, Chan, overtly denied that an episode in my medical history ever took place. This didn't

225
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:39,440
happen. And I was like, first of all, who are you again? It'd be like someone saying, you know,

226
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,080
that a mother didn't give birth to her child or, but she never had a child or something. Not that

227
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,960
my injury is my child. I'm not trying to make that association. I'm just saying that it actually

228
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,400
took place that I was treated for a specific illness by a specific doctor at a specific time.

229
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:07,680
And she's overtly said, nope, never happened. Can't have happened. There's no such diagnosis,

230
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,840
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I found it very offensive. I wrote her a letter saying, you know,

231
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:22,160
this is alarming your behavior. I'm not sure that a doctor, I mean, you can see why, you know,

232
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:32,720
why I was offended. But in this moment as I'm remembering this experience, which I conceive

233
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:41,120
of as a violation, right, the whole of my identity begins to collapse into something that can be

234
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:50,560
violated. Is that liberty? Is that virtue? Is that intelligence? Is that insight? Is that truth?

235
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:00,080
Why would I even take the time to take offense? Now, in some cases,

236
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,840
it's reasonable for us to assert what we today talk about as boundaries.

237
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:20,160
But if this becomes our fascination, whoa, W-O-E be unto us. If our fascination

238
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:27,600
and our obsession becomes the maintenance of boundaries in a world of real and imagined

239
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:33,360
violations, our humanity will collapse into an uninhabitable skeleton of

240
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:43,120
a doubt, confusion, despair. We must live beyond what happens to us and our possible

241
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:53,280
interpretations. And we also must speak up when a violation is tangibly real and not just imagined

242
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:03,280
or a projection. But again, the obsession with, I'm just a magnet for the violation of, you know,

243
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:13,040
whatever it may be, isn't a livable identity. There's not enough there, inside there, to dwell in it.

244
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So I certainly recognize

245
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,200
the urge.

246
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,800
In some cases, for something resembling redress of wrongdoing,

247
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,840
but it's a very, very dangerous

248
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:51,200
balancing game. And most often in modern society, that game becomes malignant quickly.

249
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,040
We have the wrong idea. We think there are individuals.

250
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:03,360
There's all kinds of ridiculous, pre-existing

251
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:11,440
conditionality that is nonsensical. And as the result of the terrifying reflections of

252
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,400
isolation, which could be literally understood as meaning, I am so late.

253
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:28,160
I am behind time. Time is way ahead of me. Relation is way ahead of me. I am alone.

254
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,960
And my cohort is far, it's so far ahead of me that I don't belong to it anymore.

255
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:45,520
I so late, I on. That I on means a self and also a particle and possibly a particle that

256
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:55,840
transmits or preserves something in the sense that I am here highlighting creatively.

257
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:16,480
There's so much for us to learn and recover and celebrate. We should be very careful.

258
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,880
Life is short. Existence is brief. We should make it beautiful together,

259
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,960
within for each other in the history and future of life and our peoples.

260
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:36,000
Fundamentally, these are one people, one family. It's all there is on this tiny little rock.

261
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:45,520
It's moist rock floating around in time space. This is our home. This is our body. These are

262
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:56,080
our people. There's no other people. And the idea of the individual as we ridiculously are

263
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:04,640
tortured by it today. People are like, oh, he's a fucking communist. No. Like, how many of your

264
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,040
cells in your body are individuals? Let me ask you this. Does it matter at all?

265
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:30,000
Does their individuality matter at all if the body dies? What are you going to make of their individuality then?

266
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:56,640
It's funny, the photograph I've just taken will probably become the photo I use

267
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:10,240
for this recording later.

268
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:38,800
This idea of individuals and their rights is exemplary of the loss of communal meat,

269
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:46,000
of the context, of the meaningful context of our humanity over time.

270
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:57,200
As our context became abstract, representational, commercial, domineering, viral,

271
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:06,880
frisbee, falsifications of the possibility of communal, meaningful communal experience,

272
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:14,880
roles, identity, behavior. So one of the things I saw up on top of the mountain

273
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,800
or the little hill, Strawberry Hill, was a reenaction of that possibility.

274
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:27,840
However brief and ephemeral, not even more powerful for all of its brevity,

275
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:37,280
even more powerful for its inability to fundamentally change. It's like

276
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:50,000
it's one droplet in an ocean, but that droplet shines so brightly that the entire ocean is

277
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:01,200
transformed in its spirit, if not its physical activity. So those droplets matter. That's

278
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:11,440
what I call real. It's easy to forget this because we look in our modernity and we see

279
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:24,320
a trillion, I'm going to stop saying my pause phrase, we see a trillion violations.

280
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:34,560
I'll just pick one, microplastics. Trillion violations per second. What can we do?

281
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:44,320
Is there even a we to do things? No, there isn't. And if we form a we to do things,

282
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,080
it's going to be like attempting to eat the moon or swallow the ocean, won't it?

283
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,440
And so it seems that the possibility of enacting change is pre-prohibited.

284
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:04,560
There's no real way. And a number of my friends have spoken to me about this.

285
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:12,480
I'll mention particularly Sean, who is working with PAWS AI

286
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:21,280
and express his despair. What can we do? We can't stop it.

287
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:30,720
And I explained to him the principle that I was orbiting here, which is that

288
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:39,040
when we live beautiful lives and we witness and speak together for each other for the history

289
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:46,640
and future of life on our world and of beings of all beings, when this is done with authenticity

290
00:47:46,640 --> 00:48:00,240
and passion and love, that always matters. It's not necessarily that the gods, that the victors

291
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,160
in a situation are favored of the gods as we might imagine.

292
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:14,720
And there's something above the gods, above the gods. There's something beyond the gods,

293
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,440
that even they must obey. And this is the principle for which they executed Socrates.

294
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:33,200
But he dared, they used him of atheism because he said something resembling

295
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:40,160
that even the gods must obey the spirit of truth. Even the gods are subject to this.

296
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:50,960
And this was the spear point they used for his indictment and prosecution.

297
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,960
He was an oracle.

298
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:08,400
He was a male oracle. But instead of declaring wisdom, he fomented it.

299
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:17,200
He fermented it among the people. He would bring them together in the Quora and ferment

300
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,600
the nectar of wisdom from within their hearts and spirits.

301
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:32,400
And this made him lethal to the fictions that then ruled Athens.

302
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:42,560
The warmongers, the weapon makers, Plato's parents, Plato's father, his brothers, his family.

303
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,280
We should take these matters gravely with grave seriousness and attend them carefully.

304
00:49:53,600 --> 00:50:04,480
The possibilities of the spirit of democracy, the spirits from which democracy originated,

305
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:13,120
those possibilities still exist today. Unenacted, overlooked, falsified, counterfeited.

306
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:22,160
And democracy doesn't just mean the voting of idiots. It's not the idea at all.

307
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:30,400
It's, I don't actually know what it is, but I can say how I conceive of it, which is the communal

308
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:38,080
preservation and purification of the context of our relationships, such that it becomes possible

309
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:46,080
to not merely know what is true and good and do that, but also to avoid

310
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:54,240
what is lethal and malignant and destroys history in the future and falsifies it and counterfeits

311
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,760
it and sells us the remains of it at ever-increasing prices, destroying the mothers and the children

312
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:06,560
and the fathers and the ancestors and the progeny. That must be avoided.

313
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:19,520
So these are my thoughts for the day. I'm grateful to have this opportunity to speak them

314
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:26,080
and share them with you. I hope you find them inspiring and that you are inspired enough to

315
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:37,040
become historical, perhaps to learn the ancient Greek and other ancient languages,

316
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:43,920
but particularly the Greek, and to ask questions of the oracles, to ask the imperative questions that

317
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:50,480
you brought to your human incarnation and your more than human existence, your more than merely

318
00:51:50,480 --> 00:52:00,960
human existence, that is precious and noble in its essence, that is beautiful in its origin

319
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:11,760
and transcendental in its natures. May your paths and relations, questions and dreams be blessed.

320
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,040
Alive for now.
